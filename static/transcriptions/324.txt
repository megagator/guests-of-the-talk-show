[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  KD, why do people call you KD?
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.280]  Can I call you KD?
[00:06.280 --> 00:07.360]  Yeah.
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.640]  My first name is Kevin.
[00:09.640 --> 00:10.480]  Right?
[00:10.480 --> 00:13.200]  And my second name, my last name, my second name.
[00:13.200 --> 00:15.400]  My last name is Durant, or the D.
[00:15.400 --> 00:16.240]  KD.
[00:17.520 --> 00:20.400]  This year, what percentage do you plan on giving
[00:20.400 --> 00:21.520]  on the court?
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.440]  90, 95, 100, 110?
[00:23.440 --> 00:24.640]  What are we looking at?
[00:25.640 --> 00:26.800]  110.
[00:26.800 --> 00:28.200]  110.
[00:28.200 --> 00:31.080]  I just got off the phone with the Dolan family,
[00:31.080 --> 00:33.440]  and they said that they're talking to the commissioner now.
[00:33.440 --> 00:36.200]  They're looking at working a contractual deal
[00:36.200 --> 00:39.080]  that will allow you, for days off,
[00:39.080 --> 00:41.400]  you'll be able to play for the Knicks.
[00:41.400 --> 00:42.480]  Comments?
[00:42.480 --> 00:44.640]  All right, Dave, that was the last one.
[00:44.640 --> 00:45.920]  I'm sorry, was that a comment?
[00:45.920 --> 00:46.760]  That was it.
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.360]  How about you, do you have a comment?
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.200]  Wrap it up.
[00:50.200 --> 00:52.680]  Okay, I'm being told my time is done.
[00:52.680 --> 00:54.400]  Have a great year.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.440]  What about the Pelicans?
[00:55.440 --> 00:56.760]  When you guys play the Pelicans,
[00:56.760 --> 00:58.360]  does it kind of make you giggle?
[00:59.960 --> 01:00.800]  Yeah.
[01:00.800 --> 01:02.640]  Okay, all right, that's all I got.
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.800]  That's it, everybody, thank you.
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.880]  Good night.
[01:05.880 --> 01:08.240]  Why do they call you JS, Jason?
[01:09.800 --> 01:10.640]  Well,
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.600]  big fan of January,
[01:16.200 --> 01:19.600]  and September is the best.
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.880]  And my middle initial's A,
[01:22.880 --> 01:24.920]  because August, you know, oh man.
[01:24.920 --> 01:26.360]  Yeah.
[01:26.360 --> 01:29.280]  Do you think Kevin Durant knew that it was Letterman?
[01:29.280 --> 01:30.480]  Yes.
[01:30.480 --> 01:32.520]  I have a theory on this.
[01:32.520 --> 01:34.840]  Now, one of the reasons it delighted me
[01:34.840 --> 01:39.840]  that this dropped this gem of a perfect Letterman moment
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.720]  dropped days before,
[01:41.720 --> 01:43.880]  I had already asked you to be on the show,
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.680]  but you know, for those who do not remember
[01:48.680 --> 01:50.520]  from your multiple appearances on the show,
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.320]  you and I are both David Letterman fanatics,
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.080]  it's fair to say.
[01:55.080 --> 01:55.920]  And I,
[01:57.920 --> 02:00.880]  what percent are you planning to give this season?
[02:00.880 --> 02:02.080]  80, 90?
[02:02.080 --> 02:02.920]  Oh man.
[02:04.080 --> 02:04.920]  110?
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.440]  110.
[02:06.440 --> 02:09.880]  110, all right, 110, 110 it is.
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.400]  That's a good answer.
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.600]  And then Dave from Basketball Digest
[02:14.600 --> 02:18.400]  just notes 110 the way that like the census person
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.480]  would be like, how many children under the age of 18
[02:21.480 --> 02:22.400]  do you have in the household?
[02:22.400 --> 02:25.600]  One, two, three, we have three, three, three it is.
[02:25.600 --> 02:26.720]  Okay, 110.
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.840]  It's, I just, I love the idea that Media Day
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.920]  for the NBA was literally being satirized
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.760]  on Media Day for the NBA.
[02:39.760 --> 02:42.200]  That literally, I mean, that was kind of his bit,
[02:42.200 --> 02:44.440]  was always, he's a TV guy,
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.000]  but he's also simultaneously satirizing
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.640]  everything there is about TV.
[02:48.640 --> 02:51.600]  But for the Nets,
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.000]  I mean, I don't know the backstory of it,
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.440]  but I assume for somebody in the Nets PR
[02:55.440 --> 02:57.160]  to be willing to let David Letterman
[02:57.160 --> 03:00.200]  kind of sit in the Media Day scrum
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.320]  and ask stupid questions to Kevin Durant,
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.120]  like bless that person, whoever they are.
[03:06.120 --> 03:08.840]  I have a theory and it didn't even occur to me
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.520]  until I was putting together show notes for this.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.000]  And all of a sudden it popped into my head.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.320]  Here's my theory.
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.480]  My theory is that Kevin Durant is gonna be on
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.720]  my next guest needs no introduction.
[03:20.720 --> 03:23.800]  Oh yeah, you know, that's a good, that's good.
[03:23.800 --> 03:25.840]  And then they're doing a bit
[03:25.840 --> 03:27.880]  that we'll see the other side of
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.400]  on Netflix at some point.
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.600]  That makes sense.
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.840]  That checks out.
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.480]  Yeah, because, and he's kind of a fascinating figure.
[03:36.480 --> 03:39.800]  He's, I don't know what the word is.
[03:39.800 --> 03:42.320]  I mean, he's obviously a super talented basketball player,
[03:42.320 --> 03:46.400]  but he's also sort of anatomical freak.
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.040]  He's seven feet tall, but he doesn't play like a center.
[03:50.040 --> 03:54.280]  He plays like a guard and he's sort of bounced around.
[03:54.280 --> 03:56.320]  The NBA had tremendous success.
[03:56.320 --> 03:59.680]  He's just inordinately talented.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.560]  But personality wise, he's,
[04:01.560 --> 04:03.440]  I don't know what's the word, mercurial?
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.680]  He's very hard to get a, so anyway,
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.320]  I think he'd be, and I think that Letterman loves
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.200]  that sort of subject for that, his Netflix show,
[04:15.200 --> 04:18.680]  is somebody who we don't really know.
[04:18.680 --> 04:23.640]  Right, I got to see him, not quite up close,
[04:23.640 --> 04:26.280]  but every day because he was with the Warriors
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.080]  for a couple of years.
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.600]  And yeah, I mean, we always watch the Warriors
[04:31.600 --> 04:33.240]  and we always joke, oh, hey, that's Steph Curry.
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.320]  He's good at basketball.
[04:34.320 --> 04:35.840]  With Kevin Durant, it was like,
[04:35.840 --> 04:39.760]  I think it was Mike Schur, the TV producer
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.760]  who said this first, but it's like an alien came down
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.360]  and said, I can play your basketball
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.320]  because he's the wrong size and shape to do what he does.
[04:51.320 --> 04:53.960]  And it's like, no, he's like from another league,
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.880]  whatever league is out there in the galaxy
[04:55.880 --> 04:57.520]  that's above the NBA.
[04:57.520 --> 05:00.400]  And he, for some reason, has been sent down here for a while
[05:00.400 --> 05:02.080]  because it doesn't make sense.
[05:02.080 --> 05:03.920]  And then, yeah, he's an interesting guy.
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.920]  He, I don't know, I think he is exactly the type of guy
[05:07.920 --> 05:09.120]  that Letterman would want to talk to
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.720]  and see if he could get some,
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.040]  like crack the egg a little bit about what he's thinking.
[05:15.040 --> 05:17.400]  And I kind of feel like this, like, and I,
[05:17.400 --> 05:20.120]  so I think like Letterman surprised him and he didn't,
[05:20.120 --> 05:21.840]  he wasn't, he didn't know that Letterman
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.400]  was gonna be on the call.
[05:23.400 --> 05:25.960]  I think he knew partly through
[05:25.960 --> 05:28.040]  that it was Letterman on the audio,
[05:28.040 --> 05:30.560]  but he wasn't gonna break character.
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.240]  And then he finally did when he asked him,
[05:33.240 --> 05:35.880]  I went in there trying to get Letterman off the line.
[05:35.880 --> 05:39.680]  And he's like, and he's like, the pelicans,
[05:39.680 --> 05:41.200]  does that make you giggle?
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.920]  You know, that made me laugh so hard because I mentioned,
[05:45.920 --> 05:47.440]  we went to actually to a Warriors game
[05:47.440 --> 05:48.480]  where they played the pelicans.
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.600]  And I mentioned to my wife
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.600]  that they're playing the pelicans.
[05:52.600 --> 05:54.920]  And she looks at me and she goes, ha ha.
[05:54.920 --> 05:56.240]  And I go, no, what?
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.320]  She says, that's not a real team.
[05:58.320 --> 06:00.840]  And it became a running joke in our house
[06:00.840 --> 06:03.200]  that the pelicans was just something you made up.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.760]  That's not a real, there's no team pelicans.
[06:05.760 --> 06:06.840]  That's not a team.
[06:06.840 --> 06:08.480]  And then Letterman does the same bit.
[06:08.480 --> 06:11.560]  He's like, do you hear the word pelicans and just laugh?
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.240]  It's, I mean, for listeners in New Orleans,
[06:15.240 --> 06:17.080]  I mean, I'm not putting the team down,
[06:17.080 --> 06:21.320]  but it's a very odd nickname for a sports franchise.
[06:21.320 --> 06:23.880]  And it sort of feels like,
[06:25.560 --> 06:30.080]  you know, like with the great Incredibles franchise
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.400]  at Pixar and they've decided,
[06:32.400 --> 06:36.040]  we're just gonna make our own universe of superheroes
[06:36.040 --> 06:38.080]  rather than rely on Marvel.
[06:38.080 --> 06:39.360]  I mean, obviously at this point,
[06:39.360 --> 06:41.800]  Pixar couldn't use Marvel because it's a Disney,
[06:41.800 --> 06:46.040]  but it'd be easier for the stories they wanna tell
[06:46.040 --> 06:50.600]  to just, you know, and we'll use some of the tropes
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.560]  of superheroism like, you know,
[06:52.560 --> 06:54.640]  Frozone is a guy with frozen power
[06:54.640 --> 06:58.240]  and all, you know, Marvel has a guy like that, Iceman.
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.240]  And, you know, there's a super fast kid who's like The Flash
[07:02.240 --> 07:05.440]  and, you know, there's super powers are sort of like
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.200]  a list you can choose from.
[07:07.200 --> 07:09.200]  But then you get down the list
[07:09.200 --> 07:11.680]  and you can maybe phone some of them in, right?
[07:11.680 --> 07:15.240]  And for the, you wouldn't really make a superhero
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.840]  like something, but, you know, 37 superheroes down the list.
[07:18.840 --> 07:20.560]  It would be the same thing if you were gonna make
[07:20.560 --> 07:25.560]  like a Pixar movie about a fictional version of the NBA.
[07:26.320 --> 07:29.440]  And you might make up some teams like the Pelicans.
[07:29.440 --> 07:32.400]  Right, down at 28, 29, 30, you're like, I don't know,
[07:32.400 --> 07:34.080]  Pelicans, let's just say Pelicans.
[07:34.080 --> 07:37.040]  Yeah, and it has no history, right?
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.760]  So it's also like, wait, did I miss?
[07:38.760 --> 07:40.720]  Like, if you don't follow the NBA that closely
[07:40.720 --> 07:42.480]  and, you know, we don't really in our house,
[07:42.480 --> 07:44.160]  so we are very fair weather.
[07:44.160 --> 07:45.920]  Oh, are the Warriors in the finals?
[07:45.920 --> 07:48.440]  Hooray kind of people.
[07:48.440 --> 07:50.080]  But, so you might miss it.
[07:50.080 --> 07:51.720]  And then, and they changed their name, right?
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.640]  Because they were the Hornets
[07:52.640 --> 07:54.840]  and then they gave the name of the Hornets back to Charlotte
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.320]  and they got a new name.
[07:56.320 --> 07:57.880]  So there's a lot of reasons why
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.000]  there's not a lot of history built up there.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.960]  So yes, apologies to Pelicans fans.
[08:01.960 --> 08:04.400]  I saw them, I saw the Warriors play them.
[08:04.400 --> 08:05.760]  Zion Williamson is great.
[08:05.760 --> 08:08.160]  But it is one of those things that it's also
[08:08.160 --> 08:09.880]  kind of a funny name if you think about it.
[08:09.880 --> 08:13.320]  Well, it's not the type of name that you would pick
[08:13.320 --> 08:16.600]  if you were like the general manager
[08:16.600 --> 08:20.040]  and the marketing manager and the owner of the franchise.
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.800]  Right, like you might pick it if you're a screenwriter
[08:22.800 --> 08:24.640]  making a list of fake names
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.400]  and you're not even gonna really feature this team
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.240]  in your movie.
[08:27.240 --> 08:30.360]  But like when you're all in, this is your life,
[08:30.360 --> 08:33.600]  you're going to be, you know, 18 hours a day,
[08:33.600 --> 08:37.120]  all year long, sweating this NBA franchise.
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.160]  Nothing but Pelicans.
[08:38.160 --> 08:40.560]  Yeah, and you wouldn't pick a team like the Pelicans,
[08:40.560 --> 08:42.000]  but a name like the Pelicans.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.640]  But you know, there we are.
[08:43.640 --> 08:46.200]  You know, New Orleans Jazz, it's right there.
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.040]  What are they thinking?
[08:47.040 --> 08:48.080]  They used to be in New Orleans.
[08:48.080 --> 08:50.680]  That's why they're called the Jazz.
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.880]  I don't know how they kept the Jazz in Utah.
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.600]  That should have a Utah name like the Utah Salt.
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.080]  Right, the Jazz.
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.760]  If you get the Utah Salt, sorry,
[08:58.760 --> 09:00.920]  I've been doing this bit since I was in high school.
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.360]  Utah Salt, all the local broadcasters
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.880]  and all the local writers are gonna say,
[09:04.880 --> 09:08.240]  oh my God, thank you for giving us the name Salt
[09:08.240 --> 09:10.880]  because now we can do all of these like Salt puns
[09:10.880 --> 09:14.080]  and like seasoned veterans and like, oh my God,
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.400]  it's gonna be great.
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.560]  But instead they're the Jazz.
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.240]  So, all right, fine, Pelicans is still available.
[09:20.240 --> 09:23.680]  They had the best nickname that told you exactly
[09:23.680 --> 09:26.160]  what city they were from, New Orleans,
[09:26.160 --> 09:31.160]  and then moved to the least jazzy city in North America,
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.720]  but took the name with them.
[09:33.720 --> 09:36.600]  Very few lakes in LA, by the way, to be fair.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.440]  Well, that is true.
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.160]  Minneapolis Lakers and very few lakes.
[09:40.160 --> 09:42.240]  I do kind of love that.
[09:42.240 --> 09:44.040]  Somebody talked about Mike Schur again.
[09:44.040 --> 09:46.440]  Mike Schur and Joe Pesnansky, the sports writer,
[09:46.440 --> 09:49.280]  have a podcast where they talk mostly about baseball,
[09:49.280 --> 09:53.360]  but they propose this idea that if your team moves cities,
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.320]  you should just have to change your name.
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.360]  And as a fan of a baseball team that moved from New York,
[09:59.360 --> 10:00.880]  I actually kind of agree.
[10:00.880 --> 10:03.160]  Like maybe you should leave the name behind.
[10:03.160 --> 10:04.720]  And if somebody wants to pick it up later,
[10:04.720 --> 10:05.760]  they can pick it up later,
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.120]  but maybe you should come up with a...
[10:07.120 --> 10:10.360]  Like the Giants is just kind of a random name,
[10:10.360 --> 10:15.080]  but like the Dodgers are trolley Dodgers
[10:15.080 --> 10:16.560]  from the trolleys in Brooklyn.
[10:16.560 --> 10:18.960]  There are no trolleys to dodge in LA,
[10:18.960 --> 10:23.360]  but they kept the name and it sort of just means nothing now.
[10:23.360 --> 10:25.080]  And there's an argument to be made
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.640]  that you should let the Jazz lay there
[10:27.640 --> 10:28.920]  and maybe one day in the future,
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.480]  another team in New Orleans will pick it up.
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.840]  But that's not what happened.
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.640]  Yeah, I think that that late fifties
[10:37.440 --> 10:39.600]  expansion across North America
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.120]  was different than today's era of franchises moving, right?
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.480]  It was like almost like a land rush, right?
[10:46.480 --> 10:48.080]  Yeah, it was.
[10:48.080 --> 10:49.680]  And baseball in particular,
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.440]  it was entirely East Coast,
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.040]  like I don't know what the Western most franchise was,
[10:56.040 --> 10:57.160]  maybe Kansas City?
[10:57.160 --> 10:58.880]  I'm not great at knowing like-
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.600]  No, St. Louis, I think was the,
[11:00.600 --> 11:02.160]  there wasn't a Kansas City team at that point.
[11:02.160 --> 11:05.000]  So St. Louis would have been the Western most, I think.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.760]  Oh, there wasn't the Royals?
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.440]  No, the Royals didn't,
[11:09.440 --> 11:12.520]  as a major league team wasn't until the sixties.
[11:12.520 --> 11:14.640]  Oh, okay, okay.
[11:14.640 --> 11:17.400]  I wasn't sure when they came into being in Chicago,
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.080]  but anyway, they all traveled by train.
[11:19.080 --> 11:21.800]  They were all like train distances.
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.040]  And there's this whole great Western part of the country
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.720]  that also has fantastic weather and lots of baseball fans.
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.720]  And so the teams like the Dodgers and the Giants,
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.480]  it was, it didn't feel like they were moving
[11:39.480 --> 11:40.760]  and becoming a different team.
[11:40.760 --> 11:42.400]  It felt like the team was moving
[11:42.400 --> 11:45.880]  and conceding New York to the Yankees
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.520]  and making a claim to their own great cities, right?
[11:50.520 --> 11:52.840]  San Francisco deserves a great team.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.160]  And they got a team with a history.
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.720]  And Los Angeles, obviously,
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.720]  the second biggest city in the country,
[11:57.720 --> 12:02.720]  deserves a team full of sad sack losers like the Dodgers.
[12:04.320 --> 12:05.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.880]  Well, I mean, and of course the classic story
[12:06.880 --> 12:09.600]  is that the Dodgers owner knew that he wanted to move to LA
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.880]  and he kind of conned the Giants owner
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.680]  into moving to San Francisco.
[12:14.680 --> 12:15.520]  Really?
[12:15.520 --> 12:16.960]  Yeah, he was a sucker.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.560]  But it worked out for everybody, including the Yankees.
[12:21.560 --> 12:22.960]  It's just, yeah, we could,
[12:22.960 --> 12:24.440]  I mean, it's all theoretical anyway,
[12:24.440 --> 12:26.120]  but I can see the point of saying,
[12:26.120 --> 12:28.320]  like I was very happy when the Cleveland Browns
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.480]  moved to Baltimore that they left the Browns behind
[12:31.480 --> 12:33.000]  and let the new Browns come in.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.920]  And I liked that the Hornets got,
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.880]  I don't care at all about basketball
[12:36.880 --> 12:38.080]  in Charlotte, North Carolina,
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.440]  but I think it's nice that they got their name back
[12:40.440 --> 12:41.440]  and they don't have to be the,
[12:41.440 --> 12:43.240]  whatever they were, the Bobcats or something,
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.400]  which never made sense.
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.440]  And like, I just, I feel like to a certain extent,
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.040]  the team identity kind of belongs to the city
[12:51.040 --> 12:53.040]  and that you can take your team if you need to,
[12:53.040 --> 12:55.480]  but you gotta leave the laundry,
[12:55.480 --> 12:58.080]  leave the name by the door on your way out.
[12:58.080 --> 13:00.720]  Right, and now the Browns are good again, finally.
[13:00.720 --> 13:03.920]  They are at long last, they are actually good again.
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.400]  Only took like, since Bernie Kosar.
[13:07.400 --> 13:09.760]  Yeah, like literally they haven't been good
[13:09.760 --> 13:12.600]  since before they were not there for a while.
[13:12.600 --> 13:14.160]  Before Bill Belichick was there.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.000]  Yep.
[13:16.480 --> 13:18.920]  Anyway, let me take our first break
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.320]  and thank our first sponsor.
[13:20.320 --> 13:22.920]  It's a new sponsor, very excited about this sponsor.
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.920]  Sanity.io, it's the platform for structured content
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.960]  that lets you build better digital experiences.
[13:31.960 --> 13:34.560]  It's like a CMS, but it's like a CMS system
[13:34.560 --> 13:37.240]  that you can make your own CMS in.
[13:37.240 --> 13:40.040]  They offer a terrific API experience
[13:40.040 --> 13:42.440]  and what you do is you keep your content
[13:42.440 --> 13:44.640]  in what they call the Sanity Content Lake
[13:44.640 --> 13:46.840]  and it makes it easy to respond to your needs.
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.680]  It's sort of like a soup where you just store your stuff.
[13:49.680 --> 13:53.200]  You shape your own JSON documents via their API.
[13:53.200 --> 13:55.880]  You don't need to recrop your images in advance.
[13:55.880 --> 13:58.800]  You just register a focal point and you ask the API
[13:58.800 --> 14:01.120]  for a different aspect ratio of the image
[14:01.120 --> 14:02.840]  and it crops it on the fly.
[14:02.840 --> 14:06.280]  It treats rich text as structured data
[14:06.280 --> 14:08.720]  that can be used in apps, voice assistants,
[14:08.720 --> 14:11.160]  and their fancy new web framework
[14:11.160 --> 14:12.880]  that you will want to try out.
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.600]  Look, your time is better spent
[14:16.600 --> 14:18.600]  actually developing your product or service
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.720]  than building your own CMS from the ground up
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.960]  or to hack another one to fit your needs.
[14:22.960 --> 14:25.720]  Sanity.io is a content platform
[14:25.720 --> 14:27.800]  that will get you up and running quickly.
[14:27.800 --> 14:29.680]  It's not your regular CMS.
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.440]  They have also invented open source technologies.
[14:33.440 --> 14:34.680]  I haven't even heard of this one before
[14:34.680 --> 14:35.720]  but it sounds really cool.
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.720]  Grok, G-R-O-Q, it's a query language for JSON
[14:40.760 --> 14:45.360]  and portable text, that is their agnostic rich text format
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.200]  that you can integrate into any platform.
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.200]  It is used, Sanity.io is used and trusted by renowned brands.
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.280]  You've heard of them.
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.520]  Companies like National Geographic, Nike,
[14:57.520 --> 14:59.880]  Conde Nast, and more.
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.280]  Sonos uses Sanity to integrate product and marketing efforts.
[15:03.280 --> 15:06.520]  Figma and Netify use it to drive conference
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.920]  and event content.
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.800]  You can use it for just about anything.
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.320]  It's scalable and reliable, serving more than 5 billion
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.680]  globally cached API requests every day.
[15:16.680 --> 15:20.880]  You can start building with Sanity.io today for free.
[15:20.880 --> 15:22.440]  No credit card required.
[15:22.440 --> 15:27.360]  Go to Sanity.io slash the talk show.
[15:27.360 --> 15:29.240]  And by going to that URL,
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.880]  you get a boosted free plan to try out Sanity.io.
[15:33.880 --> 15:38.880]  You can also run NPM init Sanity in your command line
[15:40.400 --> 15:42.880]  if you just want to try it out.
[15:42.880 --> 15:46.800]  Go to Sanity.io slash the talk show.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.680]  All right, you saw the list.
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.480]  Let me start with this.
[15:53.480 --> 15:54.640]  I want to get this out of the way.
[15:54.640 --> 15:55.760]  I'm going to blog about it.
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.800]  And I feel like if I put it on the podcast,
[15:57.800 --> 16:00.560]  it'll force me to throw this on Daring Fireball too.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.400]  That's beautiful.
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.600]  That's the modern, that's how we do it, right?
[16:03.600 --> 16:05.480]  You got a blog, the blog makes a podcast,
[16:05.480 --> 16:06.520]  the podcast makes a blog.
[16:06.520 --> 16:07.480]  Right.
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.640]  All right, you're familiar with the rumors,
[16:09.640 --> 16:11.640]  the rampant rumors from multiple sources
[16:11.640 --> 16:13.200]  that the Apple watch series seven
[16:13.200 --> 16:14.800]  was going to have flat sides
[16:14.800 --> 16:17.400]  and the sort of design language
[16:17.400 --> 16:20.160]  of the current iPhones and iPads.
[16:20.160 --> 16:21.520]  And then it didn't happen.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.920]  And there was a lot of, hmm.
[16:26.360 --> 16:28.840]  Here's my spitball theory on that.
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.360]  What if it is true, but also,
[16:32.360 --> 16:34.440]  but the other, the counterpart of it,
[16:34.440 --> 16:37.040]  and there's the sort of the, ah, we were right.
[16:37.040 --> 16:38.360]  It doesn't matter if it didn't happen.
[16:38.360 --> 16:39.200]  We were right.
[16:39.200 --> 16:40.600]  Apple canceled it at the last minute.
[16:40.600 --> 16:41.600]  Well, that doesn't make any sense
[16:41.600 --> 16:44.120]  because Apple watch series seven is clearly all new.
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.360]  It is a new form factor with entirely different screen.
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.760]  You can't just throw together like days before.
[16:51.760 --> 16:55.640]  File it off a little bit, just jam it in there.
[16:55.640 --> 16:57.040]  No, they're both real.
[16:57.040 --> 16:58.160]  But here's my theory.
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.000]  My theory is what if the flat side Apple watch is real,
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.200]  but it's the new low end model.
[17:06.200 --> 17:09.200]  Like what we're about to get in the coming weeks
[17:09.200 --> 17:11.800]  at some point, you know, because it was not ready
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.680]  when it was announced a couple of weeks ago
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.160]  as series seven was always intended to be series seven,
[17:17.160 --> 17:18.920]  the new top of the line,
[17:18.920 --> 17:21.000]  latest and greatest technologies Apple watch.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.760]  But what if this flat sides thing was intended
[17:23.760 --> 17:25.960]  and whether it was intended to ship now,
[17:25.960 --> 17:28.560]  or maybe it's one of those like off cycle things
[17:28.560 --> 17:31.640]  like the iPhone SE that often appears in like March
[17:31.640 --> 17:34.040]  or April or something like that.
[17:34.040 --> 17:38.800]  And therefore it to me would fit with Apple's needs
[17:38.800 --> 17:40.280]  where right now they're still selling
[17:40.280 --> 17:43.360]  the Apple watch series three, which is a bit of a shame.
[17:43.360 --> 17:45.960]  I've actually wore my series three last week
[17:45.960 --> 17:47.520]  paired with a review unit.
[17:47.520 --> 17:50.320]  And it's like, this thing's a little long in the tooth.
[17:50.320 --> 17:51.880]  Oh yeah.
[17:51.880 --> 17:55.280]  And it's sort of crappy that they're selling it to people.
[17:55.280 --> 17:56.120]  Yeah.
[17:56.120 --> 17:57.160]  But on the other hand,
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.560]  they kind of want that product marketing thing
[17:59.560 --> 18:03.560]  where there is a visual oomph of,
[18:03.560 --> 18:07.000]  hey, if you spend more, you get a better looking thing.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.440]  I think that's an interesting theory.
[18:09.440 --> 18:12.960]  I don't believe it would be the low end watch
[18:12.960 --> 18:15.360]  because I feel like there's still mileage in the SE
[18:15.360 --> 18:17.480]  that they released last year.
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.880]  In fact, the thing about the series three
[18:19.880 --> 18:24.480]  that boggles my mind is that the SE looks by all accounts,
[18:24.480 --> 18:25.600]  you look at it and you're like,
[18:25.600 --> 18:27.200]  this is the entry level watch.
[18:27.200 --> 18:29.320]  This is what Apple wants the entry level watch to be.
[18:29.320 --> 18:31.480]  And yet whatever their calculations are
[18:31.480 --> 18:33.400]  about how much margin they need to make,
[18:33.400 --> 18:34.760]  they can't get it down to the price
[18:34.760 --> 18:37.840]  where they can pull the series three out of the equation.
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.880]  And the series three serves a really good purpose.
[18:40.880 --> 18:43.640]  It is old, it is long in the tooth.
[18:43.640 --> 18:45.720]  It's got that little screen
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.400]  with the big bezels and all that.
[18:47.400 --> 18:48.320]  But what it does do,
[18:48.320 --> 18:50.920]  it gives Apple an entry price to the Apple watch.
[18:50.920 --> 18:54.840]  It lets it compete with a whole level of fitness trackers
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.000]  that they otherwise can't compete with.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.280]  And it feels to me like the SE,
[19:00.280 --> 19:02.960]  they can't get it down there to their satisfaction.
[19:02.960 --> 19:05.960]  So they're gonna keep that series three around for a while.
[19:05.960 --> 19:09.280]  So could there be another like designed to be even cheaper
[19:09.280 --> 19:11.760]  than the SE version of the Apple watch
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.560]  on the way at some point to get in a tracker market?
[19:15.560 --> 19:19.040]  Maybe my theory about the Apple watch rumor
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.960]  is forgive me for being a little more boring about it,
[19:22.960 --> 19:24.640]  but like I think it goes to the heart
[19:24.640 --> 19:25.920]  of how rumors get reported,
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.480]  which is Apple leaks obviously we get all these rumors,
[19:29.480 --> 19:32.120]  but Apple leaks from weird locations
[19:32.120 --> 19:34.880]  because Apple tries to prevent leaks,
[19:34.880 --> 19:37.040]  even though things do leak.
[19:37.040 --> 19:39.880]  They silo off people and they've got supply chain leaks,
[19:39.880 --> 19:41.960]  but they also are trying different stuff
[19:41.960 --> 19:43.720]  that doesn't end up being products.
[19:43.720 --> 19:45.920]  People play games of telephone.
[19:45.920 --> 19:48.240]  They hear about something that was true,
[19:48.240 --> 19:49.760]  but isn't true any longer.
[19:49.760 --> 19:51.200]  A lot of the gotchas people do
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.520]  when rumor reports are wrong.
[19:54.520 --> 19:56.800]  I really believe that most of those reports
[19:56.800 --> 19:58.560]  were probably true at some point.
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.560]  There are liars out there,
[19:59.560 --> 20:00.920]  but I think most of the people in this stuff
[20:00.920 --> 20:02.960]  who have a batting average,
[20:02.960 --> 20:04.600]  I think what they're getting is information
[20:04.600 --> 20:07.520]  that may have at one time, but it doesn't always stay true.
[20:07.520 --> 20:10.640]  And so when I hear about this flat sided Apple watch thing,
[20:10.640 --> 20:14.240]  my guess is that it either was or still is
[20:14.240 --> 20:16.240]  a thing that they're working on,
[20:16.240 --> 20:19.320]  but there were some assumptions somewhere in the chain
[20:19.320 --> 20:22.800]  about when it was gonna come out that were wrong.
[20:22.800 --> 20:24.480]  Either they were always wrong
[20:24.480 --> 20:27.040]  or they became wrong when something changed.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.640]  So they saw a new industrial design for the Apple watch.
[20:29.640 --> 20:32.280]  They're like, oh, you gotta know about this.
[20:32.280 --> 20:35.480]  It'll probably be out, I don't know, 2021.
[20:35.480 --> 20:38.200]  And it turns out that at some point in that process,
[20:38.200 --> 20:42.400]  Apple said, we can't ship this and they pushed it back.
[20:42.400 --> 20:44.040]  And that doesn't mean that those rumors
[20:44.040 --> 20:46.360]  are completely untrue.
[20:46.360 --> 20:48.400]  The inaccuracy may come from the fact
[20:48.400 --> 20:52.000]  that at some point along the way, Apple changed direction.
[20:52.000 --> 20:52.920]  And you might say, well,
[20:52.920 --> 20:55.000]  why did we hear about it a week before the event
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.200]  that they were totally gonna do this?
[20:56.200 --> 20:59.040]  I think the answer is somebody was talking to somebody
[20:59.040 --> 21:01.840]  who heard something, but you go back far enough in the chain
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.880]  and you realize it was kind of stale information
[21:03.880 --> 21:05.680]  and it probably changed a while ago
[21:05.680 --> 21:07.640]  and those people didn't leak.
[21:07.640 --> 21:09.600]  So this is the best they could do.
[21:09.600 --> 21:11.720]  Yeah, and the big hole in my theory
[21:11.720 --> 21:14.080]  is that the Apple watch SE,
[21:14.080 --> 21:17.040]  there's only been one model of Apple watch SE so far,
[21:17.040 --> 21:19.080]  and it was only announced a year ago.
[21:19.080 --> 21:19.920]  Yeah.
[21:19.920 --> 21:21.120]  And Apple tends to,
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.000]  at least if we base it on the copious data
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.040]  from two iPhone SEs,
[21:29.040 --> 21:32.640]  they tend to put an SE model out
[21:32.640 --> 21:34.760]  and then keep it around for years.
[21:34.760 --> 21:36.400]  Yeah, and let it sink.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.840]  Let it sink in price maybe,
[21:37.840 --> 21:40.120]  but you keep it around and you ride that for a while
[21:40.120 --> 21:43.320]  because it's designed to be the one that does that.
[21:43.320 --> 21:45.400]  The three still being around is weird
[21:45.400 --> 21:48.400]  and I'm positive that they don't want it to be around,
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.360]  but for whatever reason,
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.680]  they just can't kill it and replace it with the three.
[21:52.680 --> 21:55.160]  I don't know, they're making too much money on the SE
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.280]  to replace the three with the SE.
[21:57.280 --> 21:58.120]  I don't know what it is.
[21:58.120 --> 22:01.000]  So supply chain in 2021.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.800]  Maybe they got a lot of parts for that series three
[22:03.800 --> 22:04.640]  and they're like,
[22:04.640 --> 22:06.600]  we got to sell through all these parts first
[22:06.600 --> 22:07.880]  before we can get rid of this thing.
[22:07.880 --> 22:11.800]  So my other theory is that a lot of rumors out there
[22:11.800 --> 22:13.360]  about the Apple watch hasn't changed
[22:13.360 --> 22:15.840]  in the whatever six, seven years the Apple watch has existed.
[22:15.840 --> 22:16.680]  It hasn't changed.
[22:16.680 --> 22:17.920]  It looks basically the same.
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.200]  Yeah, I know the dimensions are different,
[22:19.200 --> 22:21.520]  but it has the look that we all know
[22:21.520 --> 22:23.240]  is the Apple watch look.
[22:23.240 --> 22:25.560]  So one of the rumors that's floating out there
[22:25.560 --> 22:27.920]  is this idea that Apple is going to change it up,
[22:27.920 --> 22:30.320]  but not in the way you necessarily think.
[22:30.320 --> 22:32.840]  There's this thought about this ruggedized version
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.160]  of the Apple watch.
[22:34.160 --> 22:36.000]  And I wonder if that's part of the mix here too,
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.320]  what Apple's planning for the future of the Apple watch
[22:38.320 --> 22:39.560]  is that it's a product line
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.880]  where the core of the watch electronically is the same,
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.640]  but they do it in some things that are different
[22:45.640 --> 22:47.800]  than just saying we have a stainless steel model,
[22:47.800 --> 22:50.320]  like a proper like ruggedized model.
[22:50.320 --> 22:53.560]  And it's still the same internals as the regular one,
[22:53.560 --> 22:56.840]  but it uses different bands and it's rugged
[22:56.840 --> 22:58.160]  and it's a totally different one.
[22:58.160 --> 22:59.280]  And if they did that,
[22:59.280 --> 23:01.360]  they could potentially offer
[23:01.360 --> 23:03.760]  other designs of the Apple watch,
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.440]  which would allow them to kind of like
[23:05.440 --> 23:07.000]  spread out a little bit and say,
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.480]  some Apple watches look different from other ones.
[23:09.480 --> 23:11.720]  They're all the same technically.
[23:11.720 --> 23:13.840]  And you can still get the one that works with the bands
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.000]  that you're all familiar with,
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.600]  but we've got a couple of new models now.
[23:16.600 --> 23:17.560]  We've got this rugged one
[23:17.560 --> 23:20.160]  and we've got this flat-sided, fancy, whatever,
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.840]  one and I do wonder if that might be
[23:22.840 --> 23:24.600]  the direction that they're going in the long run
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.600]  is trying to iterate outside of,
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.320]  like the screen and what the guts of the device are
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.600]  to make watches that look a lot different,
[23:34.600 --> 23:37.240]  even if they don't work any different.
[23:37.240 --> 23:39.680]  It was a lot of fun that this, in my opinion,
[23:39.680 --> 23:41.440]  as somebody who isn't in the rumor game,
[23:41.440 --> 23:43.400]  it was nothing but fun to see that
[23:43.400 --> 23:46.160]  the actual Apple watch seven was a complete surprise.
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.400]  And I like to laugh and cook my claim chowder,
[23:50.400 --> 23:51.680]  but it also is fun.
[23:51.680 --> 23:54.080]  It's fun to be surprised when they announce stuff.
[23:54.080 --> 23:56.560]  Everybody likes to start tossing out theories.
[23:56.560 --> 23:58.840]  And one theory was that maybe the flat-sided thing
[23:58.840 --> 24:03.000]  is the rugged Apple watch that Mark Gurman first reported.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.440]  I don't think that's the case at all.
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.800]  The rugged Apple watch has to be something
[24:07.800 --> 24:10.640]  that looks rugged, screams rugged because-
[24:10.640 --> 24:12.680]  Could be a G-shocks kind of thing, right?
[24:12.680 --> 24:14.480]  It's gonna be bulky
[24:14.480 --> 24:16.640]  and totally different,
[24:16.640 --> 24:18.760]  but there'll be an Apple watch embedded in it.
[24:18.760 --> 24:19.600]  Right. Yeah.
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.200]  And Garmin has a terrific business
[24:22.200 --> 24:23.960]  making watches like that.
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.040]  I know there's a bunch of other fitness tractors.
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.240]  It's fairly competitive in the fitness area,
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.240]  but Garmin in particular sort of has a market to their own
[24:33.240 --> 24:36.200]  for the ones that are big, chunky.
[24:36.200 --> 24:38.000]  You could go rock climbing with it.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.640]  You can fall off your bike and it's going to be fine.
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.440]  I mean, Apple shows people falling off their bike
[24:43.440 --> 24:44.600]  for fall detection,
[24:44.600 --> 24:45.920]  but you kind of don't want to smash
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.360]  your Apple watch screen against a rock
[24:48.360 --> 24:50.160]  no matter which one you have right now.
[24:50.160 --> 24:51.560]  They call them Garmin on their website.
[24:51.560 --> 24:53.480]  They actually call them adventure watches.
[24:53.480 --> 24:54.320]  Right.
[24:54.320 --> 24:59.280]  But the design language has to say to the person buying it,
[24:59.280 --> 25:01.440]  this thing can take a beating.
[25:01.440 --> 25:02.760]  So that flat one isn't it.
[25:02.760 --> 25:05.960]  But the thing to me, I think that they did change.
[25:05.960 --> 25:09.200]  I think with series three to series four,
[25:09.200 --> 25:10.800]  when you look at them side by side,
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.320]  and like I said, I had my series three on last week
[25:13.320 --> 25:15.760]  paired to a review unit phone.
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.760]  It does, the design changed going to series four.
[25:21.120 --> 25:23.840]  It's one of those classic changes where when they made it,
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.120]  it was like, ah, I see it's sort of more curvy.
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.800]  But then when you go backwards, you're like,
[25:29.800 --> 25:31.760]  ah, this thing looks like a box.
[25:31.760 --> 25:32.600]  It's right.
[25:32.600 --> 25:35.400]  It's like you go from the series one, two, or three,
[25:35.400 --> 25:38.120]  or the series zero, and then you get a series four, five,
[25:38.120 --> 25:40.680]  six, and it's like, ah, I see it's a little bit curvier,
[25:40.680 --> 25:43.560]  you know, a little bit bigger, but then you go backwards
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.360]  and it's like, this thing looks like a box
[25:45.360 --> 25:47.800]  with round sides that were tacked on.
[25:47.800 --> 25:49.200]  I get it that there's an evolution there.
[25:49.200 --> 25:51.760]  I guess what I would say is that they're all still
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.280]  recognizably Apple Watch as we have come to know it.
[25:55.280 --> 25:57.320]  And if you're making an argument at some point
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.880]  that Apple needs to make like a clean break
[26:00.880 --> 26:02.480]  and do a totally different thing,
[26:02.480 --> 26:04.320]  it would need to not look like an evolution
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.160]  of the Apple Watch.
[26:05.160 --> 26:06.000]  It would need to look different.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.300]  I think that the problem is that the Apple Watch
[26:08.300 --> 26:11.760]  has been so successful now and is so iconic in a way,
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.360]  when you look at it, you cannot look at a person
[26:15.360 --> 26:19.240]  in the news or on TV or in a movie and not be like,
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.000]  that's an Apple Watch when you see it.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.840]  And that is a lot of product value and marketing value.
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.280]  So for Apple to just say, we're not making it anymore,
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.760]  we're doing something different, not that they won't do it,
[26:30.760 --> 26:33.720]  but like they need a really, really, really good reason
[26:33.720 --> 26:36.200]  to make something that doesn't scan as Apple Watch.
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.200]  And I don't know if the rumor of the flat sided one was,
[26:41.220 --> 26:42.580]  was it too subtle?
[26:42.580 --> 26:44.560]  Will it essentially still look like an Apple Watch
[26:44.560 --> 26:45.520]  just subtly different?
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.880]  Was it oversold in terms of the rumor
[26:47.880 --> 26:49.520]  or is it something that we're not even seeing
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.440]  that's a different style of Apple Watch altogether?
[26:51.440 --> 26:52.280]  I don't know.
[26:52.280 --> 26:54.080]  And this gets into something
[26:54.080 --> 26:56.280]  from the original Apple Watch introduction
[26:56.280 --> 26:57.860]  where they really kind of played it up
[26:57.860 --> 27:01.960]  as part of the watch industry, right?
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.760]  And talked about it being the most accurate watch
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.440]  I've ever made and in the watch industry,
[27:08.440 --> 27:10.120]  watches don't change, right?
[27:10.120 --> 27:12.960]  Like a Rolex Submariner looks the one
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.960]  that Sean Connery is wearing in Dr. No from 1961,
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.080]  which was actually like a five or six year old Submariner
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.000]  that I think Cubby Broccoli, like they do,
[27:23.000 --> 27:23.880]  like he needs a watch.
[27:23.880 --> 27:24.960]  And Cubby Broccoli was like,
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.320]  oh, here, let him wear my Rolex.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.720]  That's something a spy would wear.
[27:28.720 --> 27:31.420]  To most people's eyes, other than like the scratches
[27:31.420 --> 27:33.260]  it might've accumulated over 60 years,
[27:33.260 --> 27:36.880]  it's almost exactly the same design as a Rolex Submariner
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.360]  you could try to buy today.
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.600]  Like that's how watches work.
[27:40.600 --> 27:44.960]  Rolex doesn't jerk their designs around back and forth
[27:44.960 --> 27:46.540]  just to say, this is new.
[27:46.540 --> 27:49.360]  It's sort of like you establish a classic and that's it.
[27:49.360 --> 27:51.880]  Right, and then you establish other product lines around it,
[27:51.880 --> 27:53.440]  which Apple hasn't really done.
[27:53.440 --> 27:55.100]  And that's sort of what I'm getting at
[27:55.100 --> 27:56.820]  with the idea of do you do a ruggedized one
[27:56.820 --> 27:58.240]  and do you do something with a different look?
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.580]  You could diversify your watch line in that way,
[28:02.580 --> 28:05.720]  style-wise, while still keeping the technology
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.520]  in a series the same.
[28:08.520 --> 28:10.840]  Like, yeah, I was at the jewelry store the other week
[28:10.840 --> 28:13.920]  and they had Speedmaster watches there.
[28:13.920 --> 28:15.800]  And like, they look exactly like the watches
[28:15.800 --> 28:16.920]  that the Apollo astronauts wore.
[28:16.920 --> 28:17.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.080]  And I know they're not, but they are.
[28:20.080 --> 28:21.600]  Because why would you give up?
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.080]  You've got the astronaut watch,
[28:23.080 --> 28:24.800]  you should keep selling it.
[28:24.800 --> 28:27.240]  Right, you've got the watch Buzz Aldrin wore on the moon.
[28:27.240 --> 28:28.480]  You're not gonna beat it.
[28:28.480 --> 28:30.360]  You're never gonna beat that for cool.
[28:30.360 --> 28:33.160]  That's one of the coolest watches ever made.
[28:33.160 --> 28:34.360]  It's exactly true.
[28:34.360 --> 28:35.280]  So that's my theory.
[28:35.280 --> 28:37.720]  Basically, if like six months from now
[28:37.720 --> 28:40.760]  there's a new iPhone SE and it has flat sides
[28:40.760 --> 28:41.760]  and maybe the price.
[28:41.760 --> 28:43.320]  New Apple Watch, Apple Watch SE?
[28:43.320 --> 28:44.200]  Yeah, Apple Watch.
[28:44.200 --> 28:45.480]  I keep saying iPhone SE.
[28:45.480 --> 28:48.340]  Apple Watch SE, thank you, Jason, for saving me.
[28:49.180 --> 28:52.000]  Maybe what happened is everybody knew
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.280]  that there's gonna be a new Apple Watch in September
[28:55.280 --> 28:57.680]  and there's this flat design thing
[28:57.680 --> 29:00.600]  floating around the supply chain and prototype changes.
[29:00.600 --> 29:02.400]  So people put two and two together and think,
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.960]  well, that's the new Apple Watch for September.
[29:05.960 --> 29:06.800]  But it wasn't.
[29:06.800 --> 29:10.960]  It was something else that was never intended to ship now.
[29:10.960 --> 29:12.920]  It's intended to ship six months from now
[29:12.920 --> 29:14.560]  or maybe even a year from now
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.560]  and let the other SE have two years as the SE model.
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.580]  Something like that.
[29:19.580 --> 29:20.420]  That's my theory.
[29:20.420 --> 29:23.040]  Because it does to me, I think it looks plainer.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.600]  I don't think that flat side design.
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.920]  I think it's a legit design
[29:26.920 --> 29:28.920]  and looks like something that I could actually
[29:28.920 --> 29:30.340]  see Apple making.
[29:30.340 --> 29:34.320]  But that to me looks like a $199 Apple Watch.
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.420]  It does not look at all like what would sell
[29:37.420 --> 29:40.480]  for a $500 stainless steel Apple Watch
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.760]  or the even more expensive Hermes models, et cetera.
[29:44.760 --> 29:46.520]  Yeah, I think that the existence
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.780]  of the current Apple Watch SE would be theoretically
[29:49.780 --> 29:51.200]  an argument against what you're saying.
[29:51.200 --> 29:52.960]  The problem is that the fact that the SE
[29:52.960 --> 29:54.800]  has come out twice now,
[29:54.800 --> 29:57.000]  two cycles of Apple Watch announcements
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.600]  and it hasn't moved down the price list
[29:59.600 --> 30:03.220]  does make me wonder if there's a problem with it.
[30:03.220 --> 30:05.000]  Like they can't make it.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.160]  It is not fulfilling the need that the three is fulfilling.
[30:08.160 --> 30:11.140]  You know, working with the competitors that are trackers
[30:11.140 --> 30:13.920]  and maybe they do go back to the drawing board and say,
[30:13.920 --> 30:18.060]  why don't we do a watch OS based fitness tracker?
[30:18.060 --> 30:19.640]  So like, let's simplify.
[30:19.640 --> 30:21.500]  And we want to hit that price point
[30:21.500 --> 30:23.040]  that we want it to be cheap.
[30:23.040 --> 30:24.720]  And we may call it an Apple Watch
[30:24.720 --> 30:25.880]  or we may not,
[30:25.880 --> 30:29.960]  but the goal is not to have everything in it, every sensor,
[30:29.960 --> 30:33.700]  like let's engineer this to be our place down there
[30:33.700 --> 30:35.300]  at the bottom of the product line
[30:35.300 --> 30:37.600]  where we can compete with other fitness trackers
[30:37.600 --> 30:40.000]  while still being committed to Apple Watch up here,
[30:40.000 --> 30:40.920]  higher up.
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.200]  And you know, most Apple Watch buyers won't buy that watch
[30:43.200 --> 30:46.020]  because it really is just a fitness tracker
[30:46.020 --> 30:47.960]  and it doesn't have any of the niceties of it.
[30:47.960 --> 30:50.040]  It's possible that that's the scenario here
[30:50.040 --> 30:52.160]  is that the SE, it turns out,
[30:52.160 --> 30:54.000]  you know, they built a cheaper Apple Watch
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.120]  but it's really not what they want.
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.440]  Yeah, the Apple Watch SE came out last year
[31:00.440 --> 31:04.840]  and it is the Apple Watch Series 6 form factor,
[31:04.840 --> 31:07.380]  but it doesn't have the EKG feature
[31:07.380 --> 31:10.240]  and it doesn't have the blood oxygen feature, right?
[31:10.240 --> 31:14.240]  I think it's basically an Apple Watch Series 4,
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.640]  I want to say.
[31:16.640 --> 31:18.580]  It's like an amalgamation
[31:18.580 --> 31:21.160]  of a couple of different Apple Watch Series
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.720]  that they kind of put together
[31:23.720 --> 31:26.960]  so they couldn't give it a series number of its own
[31:26.960 --> 31:28.720]  in order to have something a little lower down
[31:28.720 --> 31:29.540]  on the price list.
[31:29.540 --> 31:31.560]  They can't like that it's still the Series 3.
[31:31.560 --> 31:34.240]  They know that it has all those issues with its processor
[31:34.240 --> 31:35.800]  and with the screen size
[31:35.800 --> 31:38.300]  and like they can't want to keep it there.
[31:38.300 --> 31:42.320]  So the real question is, is the SE its true successor
[31:42.320 --> 31:44.760]  or was the SE sort of something intended to do that,
[31:44.760 --> 31:46.880]  couldn't do it, and they went back to the drawing board
[31:46.880 --> 31:48.360]  to make an even cheaper watch.
[31:48.360 --> 31:51.080]  Right, and as much as our developer friends
[31:51.080 --> 31:55.240]  are sort of like sigh because now there's this other screen
[31:55.240 --> 31:58.520]  size with totally different, it's not just shrunk,
[31:58.520 --> 32:01.240]  it's a totally different design language
[32:01.240 --> 32:05.600]  for the series before four screens
[32:05.600 --> 32:08.200]  that their Apple Watch complications
[32:08.200 --> 32:09.920]  and their apps have to support.
[32:09.920 --> 32:11.680]  Well, Apple has to support all that too
[32:11.680 --> 32:13.160]  because they're selling a brand new watch
[32:13.160 --> 32:15.960]  and if they're going to be selling this brand new,
[32:15.960 --> 32:20.200]  to a customer brand new Series 3 Apple Watch,
[32:20.200 --> 32:24.280]  that means watchOS has to support it for at least two years,
[32:24.280 --> 32:26.440]  I would think as a minimum.
[32:26.440 --> 32:28.540]  My favorite watch face is utility,
[32:28.540 --> 32:32.580]  which is one of those pre Series 4 watch faces.
[32:32.580 --> 32:33.840]  And this is one of those examples where,
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.760]  I mean, my argument is that Apple should update
[32:35.760 --> 32:37.640]  all those watch faces for the bigger screens.
[32:37.640 --> 32:40.200]  But I think one of the reasons they don't
[32:40.200 --> 32:44.160]  is because they gotta support them on Series 3.
[32:44.160 --> 32:47.240]  They're like, they can't not have watch faces for Series 3.
[32:47.240 --> 32:49.840]  So they keep it around and it's a face that will work
[32:49.840 --> 32:51.320]  with the Series 3 complications
[32:51.320 --> 32:53.040]  and that smaller screen size.
[32:53.040 --> 32:54.720]  And so, yeah, everybody's being held back
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.720]  by that device being there.
[32:56.720 --> 32:59.400]  And again, if they made a low cost tracker,
[32:59.400 --> 33:03.680]  maybe it's safer, it's easier for them to say
[33:03.680 --> 33:06.000]  it only supports a certain number of faces
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.400]  and it only supports the certain kinds of apps.
[33:08.400 --> 33:10.720]  It doesn't need to be a full on Apple Watch
[33:10.720 --> 33:12.960]  or maybe it can be, I don't know,
[33:12.960 --> 33:14.720]  but it's an interesting idea.
[33:14.720 --> 33:16.200]  I think Apple Watch is fascinating
[33:16.200 --> 33:18.360]  and this is why we've been talking about it all this time
[33:18.360 --> 33:20.640]  because there's a lot of potential there for Apple
[33:20.640 --> 33:22.480]  to do way more than they've done
[33:22.480 --> 33:25.120]  during the first handful of years of its existence.
[33:25.120 --> 33:27.680]  And I think it has been a successful product for them.
[33:27.680 --> 33:30.160]  I think it's probably been maybe even more successful
[33:30.160 --> 33:31.440]  than they expected.
[33:31.440 --> 33:33.280]  And so where do they go from here?
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.720]  How does this thing change over the long haul
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.600]  and can they do more than just sort of
[33:37.600 --> 33:39.760]  a new model every year?
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.000]  Yeah, we know what the big three fitness stats are
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.120]  because it's one of those things that they got right.
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.560]  In addition to this sort of iconic industrial design
[33:48.560 --> 33:49.840]  where you can just tell, like you said,
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.040]  when you're watching a Colbert show,
[33:51.040 --> 33:53.080]  you're like, oh, Stephen Colbert's wearing an Apple Watch.
[33:53.080 --> 33:53.920]  You know it.
[33:53.920 --> 33:55.920]  The big three, one of the things they got right
[33:55.920 --> 33:57.400]  are the rings, right?
[33:57.400 --> 34:00.720]  You've got your calories, your exercise minutes,
[34:00.720 --> 34:02.200]  and your stand hours.
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.200]  And a watch that only did those,
[34:05.200 --> 34:06.960]  there's an awful lot of people who you're like,
[34:06.960 --> 34:09.560]  and you're like, oh, but if you spend another $150,
[34:09.560 --> 34:11.480]  you can get EK, and they're like, no, no, no.
[34:11.480 --> 34:13.080]  I want the exercise.
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.480]  I want the exercise and the stand and the calories.
[34:15.480 --> 34:17.600]  Yeah, and maybe there are no apps
[34:17.600 --> 34:18.960]  other than the Apple apps on there.
[34:18.960 --> 34:20.480]  And it's a slimmed down number of apps
[34:20.480 --> 34:21.600]  and there's no third-party apps.
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.200]  And it really is more like a watchOS-based fitness tracker
[34:25.200 --> 34:27.880]  than it is an Apple Watch as we know it today.
[34:27.880 --> 34:29.400]  And there's a market for that
[34:29.400 --> 34:33.360]  without necessarily eroding the whole Apple Watch market.
[34:33.360 --> 34:35.160]  Anyway, that's my spitball theory.
[34:35.160 --> 34:36.360]  Interesting. I'm coming around.
[34:36.360 --> 34:37.280]  I'm coming around.
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.160]  It's like they've got the two markets I see them
[34:40.160 --> 34:42.360]  looking at and thinking, hmm,
[34:42.360 --> 34:45.240]  there's that rugged Garmin G-Shock market,
[34:45.240 --> 34:47.400]  and then there's the fitness tracker market, right?
[34:47.400 --> 34:49.200]  And some of the people with the fitness trackers
[34:49.200 --> 34:50.520]  are really, really small.
[34:50.520 --> 34:52.560]  They're almost more like bracelets than watches,
[34:52.560 --> 34:54.280]  or really, they are bracelets.
[34:54.280 --> 34:57.240]  So I would say those are the two markets they're looking at.
[34:57.240 --> 34:58.060]  All right, what about this?
[34:58.060 --> 34:59.320]  I wrote about this a little bit.
[34:59.320 --> 35:00.400]  I have it in our notes.
[35:00.400 --> 35:02.440]  No lightning for you, iPhone users.
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.040]  No lightning for you.
[35:04.040 --> 35:05.400]  You have to go to USB-C.
[35:05.400 --> 35:06.640]  No, that's not true.
[35:06.640 --> 35:07.480]  I still don't think,
[35:07.480 --> 35:09.480]  I don't care what the European Union says.
[35:09.480 --> 35:12.400]  I don't think there's ever going to be a USB-C Apple Watch,
[35:12.400 --> 35:15.560]  or now I'm saying Apple Watch, iPhone.
[35:15.560 --> 35:16.400]  I don't know.
[35:16.400 --> 35:18.160]  I could see it at some point,
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.360]  regardless of what the EU does.
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.360]  I also think that Apple kind of doesn't want ports anymore.
[35:27.160 --> 35:28.760]  And the question is sort of like,
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.160]  well, what are ports good for?
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.040]  And ports do have advantages,
[35:32.040 --> 35:34.440]  including the fact that they charge faster
[35:34.440 --> 35:36.640]  and that they do faster data transfer,
[35:36.640 --> 35:39.280]  and that at least the way Apple's devices
[35:39.280 --> 35:41.400]  have been engineered for a while now,
[35:41.400 --> 35:44.360]  having the port is sort of the only way to save something
[35:44.360 --> 35:46.640]  that is otherwise basically a brick.
[35:46.640 --> 35:49.800]  But, you know, there are other options.
[35:49.800 --> 35:51.960]  Like Apple has experimented
[35:51.960 --> 35:54.360]  with the smart connector stuff on the iPad,
[35:54.360 --> 35:58.040]  which is a data connection as well as a power connection.
[35:58.040 --> 36:00.440]  It's not fast, but it is a data connection.
[36:00.440 --> 36:02.520]  You could imagine a MagSafe version
[36:02.520 --> 36:04.800]  that actually also has some data connectors.
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.480]  You know, if you get the right cable
[36:06.480 --> 36:08.480]  and you can plug it into a computer
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.360]  and you can do a reset on it or something like that.
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.880]  I think the longer we go,
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.480]  the less terrified I am of the idea of a portless iPhone.
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.600]  But I also realized that a portless iPhone can't happen
[36:23.600 --> 36:27.320]  until Apple is sure
[36:27.320 --> 36:30.840]  that it isn't going to cost it a fortune in support
[36:30.840 --> 36:32.840]  when people brick their devices, right?
[36:32.840 --> 36:35.960]  Like, so I have faith on this level
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.680]  that it's in Apple's own self-interest
[36:38.680 --> 36:41.400]  to make sure that the biggest problem
[36:41.400 --> 36:42.680]  with having a portless iPhone,
[36:42.680 --> 36:45.360]  which is what happens if it breaks,
[36:45.360 --> 36:48.080]  is not a problem because that is going to come down on Apple.
[36:48.080 --> 36:50.280]  Like, Apple has to support all of those devices.
[36:50.280 --> 36:52.080]  You know, plugging in your iPhone is a great way
[36:52.080 --> 36:54.800]  to get your iPhone back up and running if something dies.
[36:54.800 --> 36:56.600]  So I think it could happen.
[36:56.600 --> 36:57.840]  I'm not putting it past them.
[36:57.840 --> 36:59.400]  They put USB-C on everything else.
[36:59.400 --> 37:00.600]  They could put it on an iPhone.
[37:00.600 --> 37:03.960]  But I do think that the way they've been going
[37:03.960 --> 37:06.800]  is they want to make ports obsolete.
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.360]  The European Commission's decision, draft decision,
[37:10.360 --> 37:13.480]  to say all these devices, including all phones,
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.480]  must have USB-C ports prompted me to get my,
[37:18.840 --> 37:21.640]  here's why I think the iPhone is still on Lightning
[37:21.640 --> 37:24.040]  and will continue to be post off my chest.
[37:24.040 --> 37:26.200]  Most of the time, I have the idea
[37:26.200 --> 37:28.120]  that I think I could get this out
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.480]  in about 1,000 to 1,500 words,
[37:31.480 --> 37:33.640]  and it'll take me a day, and I'll do it,
[37:33.640 --> 37:37.160]  and then, boom, it spirals, and it's 4,000 words,
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.880]  and it's taken me a week, and I haven't showered,
[37:39.880 --> 37:42.480]  and, you know, where's John?
[37:42.480 --> 37:43.960]  Oh, he's in, you know, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[37:43.960 --> 37:45.920]  It's 4 p.m., and you haven't had lunch yet.
[37:45.920 --> 37:46.840]  Yep, I know it.
[37:46.840 --> 37:49.680]  Don't bother your father, right?
[37:49.680 --> 37:51.440]  I thought this was gonna be one of those.
[37:51.440 --> 37:52.800]  I was like, this is gonna be awful.
[37:52.800 --> 37:55.480]  This is gonna take me, I've got so many thoughts.
[37:55.480 --> 37:57.480]  I think it requires so much nuance,
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.040]  and everybody just wants, the proponents of USB-C
[38:01.040 --> 38:04.600]  just want to say, I want one plug that I can take everywhere.
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.560]  I've already got, I have to have USB-C
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.720]  for my iPad and, and or my MacBook,
[38:09.720 --> 38:12.120]  and I'm all in on Apple stuff anyway, right?
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.720]  I've got a MacBook, I've got an iPad Pro,
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.920]  so I've got these USB-C ports.
[38:16.920 --> 38:19.680]  USB-C has higher capacity, you know,
[38:19.680 --> 38:21.920]  you can charge up to 85 watts.
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.320]  I forget what the, the maximum speed is,
[38:25.320 --> 38:29.240]  and it does data much faster, and you can, you know,
[38:29.240 --> 38:31.640]  do things now, like shoot ProRes video,
[38:31.640 --> 38:34.920]  which is like six gigabits per minute,
[38:34.920 --> 38:36.840]  and, or gigabytes per minute.
[38:36.840 --> 38:39.280]  I forget how, it might be six gigabytes per minute.
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.120]  It's, it's humongous, and you gotta get it off the phone,
[38:43.120 --> 38:45.000]  and getting it off the phone with a lightning cable
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  that maxes out at USB-C two speeds is sort of, you know.
[38:50.280 --> 38:51.200]  No, it's ridiculous.
[38:51.200 --> 38:53.040]  That, I think that's one. Really slow.
[38:53.040 --> 38:53.880]  I get it.
[38:53.880 --> 38:55.840]  I think that's one of the strongest arguments for USB-C
[38:55.840 --> 38:57.840]  is just that if Apple has these Pro phones
[38:57.840 --> 39:00.000]  that are just consuming so much data,
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.360]  that you might actually need
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.280]  to get a decent cable connection in there
[39:04.280 --> 39:05.640]  to get all that stuff off.
[39:05.640 --> 39:08.040]  All sorts of good reasons to go to USB-C,
[39:08.040 --> 39:09.320]  and like I wrote in my piece,
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.840]  like when iPads moved to USB-C,
[39:11.840 --> 39:12.760]  you can look at my reviews.
[39:12.760 --> 39:13.960]  I never complained about it.
[39:13.960 --> 39:16.040]  It was, you know, and I'm in the middle.
[39:16.040 --> 39:18.560]  I, me personally, I've got all of these cables everywhere.
[39:18.560 --> 39:19.680]  I'm fine with it.
[39:19.680 --> 39:21.800]  If they did it, it's okay.
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.160]  But that argument, the proponents of that
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.880]  are single-minded in favor of the technical advantages
[39:29.880 --> 39:33.600]  of USB-C and the convenience advantages
[39:33.600 --> 39:36.000]  for them personally,
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.800]  based on all the stuff they already have
[39:37.800 --> 39:39.760]  and just having one plug they could take with them
[39:39.760 --> 39:41.240]  to a hotel when they travel.
[39:41.240 --> 39:43.520]  And they're not looking at it at all
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.000]  from Apple's perspective of having like,
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  seriously, like a billion iPhone users around the world,
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  most of whom don't, I believe most iPhone users
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.360]  certainly don't own a Mac of any kind
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.800]  and probably don't own an iPad, you know,
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.200]  and they might not, you know, many of them,
[40:02.200 --> 40:04.960]  it's the only thing that we would call a personal computer
[40:04.960 --> 40:06.640]  is their iPhone.
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.320]  These people do not want to replace their cables.
[40:10.320 --> 40:13.040]  And I cannot emphasize to underline that enough times
[40:13.040 --> 40:16.520]  with a thick enough Sharpie.
[40:16.520 --> 40:18.200]  I know the pandemic has made this harder,
[40:18.200 --> 40:19.440]  but there was a period in there
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.040]  where it was still very easy to go to hotels
[40:24.040 --> 40:26.760]  and almost always find a clock radio
[40:26.760 --> 40:31.760]  with a big iPod connector on it, the 30 pin connector,
[40:31.920 --> 40:33.880]  because everybody invested in that ecosystem
[40:33.880 --> 40:36.160]  because the iPhone was so popular.
[40:36.160 --> 40:39.120]  Now, look, there is an argument to be made
[40:39.120 --> 40:42.680]  that that's why you want everything on USB-C,
[40:42.680 --> 40:44.960]  because you don't want to have hotels investing
[40:44.960 --> 40:47.080]  in these things that don't do the right port
[40:47.080 --> 40:50.440]  for the iPhones, but do for Android or vice versa.
[40:50.440 --> 40:52.840]  Everybody wants everything to be standardized.
[40:52.840 --> 40:55.240]  Great, like, I get that argument,
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.480]  but your argument is something that us very techie people,
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.280]  I think, are so easy to cast aside.
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.640]  It's a little bit like the new version of Safari
[41:04.640 --> 41:06.800]  where we all talked about it over the summer,
[41:06.800 --> 41:09.000]  but then regular people just get their software update
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.400]  and they immediately say, oh, what the hell is this?
[41:11.400 --> 41:12.400]  How did this happen?
[41:12.400 --> 41:13.840]  Like, how was this allowed to happen?
[41:13.840 --> 41:15.880]  We're like, yeah, we could have told you.
[41:15.880 --> 41:16.800]  Well, guess what?
[41:16.800 --> 41:18.840]  Everybody who has an iPhone,
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.880]  who gets a new iPhone that doesn't have the right plug
[41:21.880 --> 41:24.240]  and every accessory that they've bought
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.520]  over the last five, seven years is no longer functional
[41:28.520 --> 41:32.080]  without an adapter or a new plug or something like that,
[41:32.080 --> 41:34.320]  they're gonna be really angry about it,
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.360]  which is not to say that that's a blocker, right?
[41:36.360 --> 41:37.400]  That's not a reason not to do it.
[41:37.400 --> 41:38.560]  Apple already did it once,
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.240]  but it is a reason to be really, really sure
[41:42.240 --> 41:43.520]  that when you make the change,
[41:43.520 --> 41:46.160]  again, a thing I think people don't think about enough,
[41:46.160 --> 41:49.280]  if Apple makes this change, it needs to stick,
[41:49.280 --> 41:52.120]  because Apple is not gonna make a generation of iPhones
[41:52.120 --> 41:53.120]  that have a different port
[41:53.120 --> 41:55.880]  and then the next year a different one, right?
[41:55.880 --> 41:57.120]  Last time they did this,
[41:57.120 --> 42:00.160]  they were committing to Lightning for a long time.
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.320]  So if they do it again, if it's to USB-C,
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.320]  it needs to be like confident that it's gonna stay there
[42:08.760 --> 42:11.440]  because it doesn't wanna move again.
[42:12.320 --> 42:15.800]  Phil Schiller introduced Lightning in 2012.
[42:15.800 --> 42:17.640]  Somebody dug this up on Twitter.
[42:17.640 --> 42:20.880]  I forget who sent me the mention or something.
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.840]  It was the 2012 iPhone 4 introduction.
[42:26.440 --> 42:31.440]  And obviously in 2012, Steve Jobs was dead.
[42:32.040 --> 42:34.520]  He died in 2011.
[42:34.520 --> 42:37.320]  So it was the first iPhone introduction.
[42:37.320 --> 42:40.160]  I mean, obviously the iPhone 4S was introduced
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.200]  days before he died, so he wasn't there for that.
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.720]  So it wasn't the first Steve Jobless iPhone introduction,
[42:47.720 --> 42:50.680]  but it was the first one where he was dead.
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.320]  Phil Schiller handled the heavy lifting of the keynote
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.520]  and introduced the Lightning port on the iPhone 5
[42:58.520 --> 43:01.360]  and said at the time it would be their port
[43:01.360 --> 43:02.880]  for the next decade to come.
[43:03.760 --> 43:04.800]  And somebody posited,
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.680]  well, then they're definitely gonna keep it for 10 years
[43:06.680 --> 43:08.960]  because Phil Schiller is gonna wanna be proven right
[43:08.960 --> 43:10.040]  that it was 10 years.
[43:10.040 --> 43:12.160]  And I'm like, Phil Schiller does not care
[43:12.160 --> 43:14.840]  if it was eight years or nine years or 10 years.
[43:14.840 --> 43:17.920]  I mean, a decade is a loose term.
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.920]  He wasn't like he was promising 10 years of lightning.
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.160]  But it is true though that in all of the years,
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.200]  15 generations of iPhones, they've switched once.
[43:29.200 --> 43:31.880]  And the switch that they made the first time
[43:31.880 --> 43:35.600]  was from a port that they had invented.
[43:35.600 --> 43:38.160]  It wasn't in the original iPod.
[43:38.160 --> 43:39.880]  You might remember when they switched.
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.680]  The first two iPods used Firewire.
[43:43.680 --> 43:47.120]  I think the third generation used the dock connector.
[43:47.120 --> 43:49.800]  Actually had a Firewire port on them.
[43:49.800 --> 43:52.800]  With a little flap that you could cover it up with
[43:52.800 --> 43:55.520]  because otherwise everything would get in there
[43:55.520 --> 43:57.440]  and destroy it, yeah.
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.480]  My thing is I think it's too late now to switch to USB-C.
[44:01.480 --> 44:03.160]  And I think that it was never a good time
[44:03.160 --> 44:04.920]  for the iPhone to switch to USB-C.
[44:04.920 --> 44:07.600]  I think it is extremely telling.
[44:07.600 --> 44:10.880]  Like Apple isn't the Apple that we knew
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.320]  when you and I were younger and computers
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.160]  were the most casual person who bought a computer
[44:18.160 --> 44:19.560]  was still somewhat of a nerd
[44:19.560 --> 44:21.160]  compared to the general public, right?
[44:21.160 --> 44:24.160]  Like everybody didn't have computers.
[44:24.160 --> 44:26.160]  And then eventually, especially with the iPhone,
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.160]  now they do and Apple serves a very different market
[44:31.800 --> 44:33.000]  with people like that.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.720]  And I think it is extremely telling that last month,
[44:37.720 --> 44:40.360]  Apple introduced two brand new,
[44:40.360 --> 44:43.960]  mostly consumer priced iPads,
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.080]  the iPad mini at $500 and the new no adjective iPad
[44:48.080 --> 44:50.320]  starting at 329.
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.960]  And the just plain iPad still has lightning.
[44:54.960 --> 44:56.640]  It's a different market.
[44:56.640 --> 44:59.760]  And for those people, like people who just want
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.640]  a plain old, right?
[45:01.640 --> 45:04.920]  At this point, we can say it's the old style iPad.
[45:06.200 --> 45:11.000]  It speaks to their understanding
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.320]  of the different markets out there.
[45:13.320 --> 45:15.040]  I don't think I agree with that
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.480]  just because that old iPad has lightning
[45:17.480 --> 45:19.880]  because the old iPad design has lightning
[45:19.880 --> 45:22.240]  and it's cheap because they haven't changed the design.
[45:22.240 --> 45:25.880]  And they updated the mini to use the iPad Air Design,
[45:25.880 --> 45:27.800]  which last year got the USB-C.
[45:27.800 --> 45:29.680]  So state of the art is USB-C,
[45:29.680 --> 45:32.360]  but they're not gonna go back and insert USB-C
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.040]  in the old cheap iPad because it is basically a relic
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.160]  from five years ago that they update just to keep it alive.
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.320]  So I don't think that necessarily says anything
[45:42.320 --> 45:44.640]  about their philosophy about connectors.
[45:44.640 --> 45:48.360]  I think that the USB-C on the Mac and on the iPad,
[45:48.360 --> 45:50.800]  obviously they've completely embraced it.
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.240]  But the thing is, and also I would throw out there,
[45:54.240 --> 45:56.720]  I suspect that if Apple could have seen the future,
[45:56.720 --> 45:58.600]  they wouldn't have introduced lightning
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.000]  because lightning and USB-C are pretty similar
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.320]  and USB-C solves most of the problems that lightning solved.
[46:05.320 --> 46:08.000]  But the USB-C was so slow in coming along
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.280]  that Apple basically invented their own thing first.
[46:11.280 --> 46:13.880]  But now it's everywhere on iPhones
[46:13.880 --> 46:17.120]  and on their track pads and their mice
[46:17.120 --> 46:20.120]  and their AirPod charging ports.
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.240]  They're all lightning, right?
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.440]  It's this light duty charging, leaving data aside,
[46:25.440 --> 46:28.760]  charging plug that they've invested so much in.
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.000]  And it takes, I'm not putting them past them
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.400]  to have a grand master strategy
[46:35.400 --> 46:37.640]  to bring everything else to USB-C.
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.640]  What gives me pause on the iPhone is just that
[46:40.640 --> 46:43.280]  they seem to also have this other grand master strategy,
[46:43.280 --> 46:45.120]  which is getting rid of all the ports.
[46:45.120 --> 46:47.280]  And does that, on that particular product,
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.120]  because right, the iPad and the Mac adopted USB-C
[46:51.120 --> 46:52.320]  a long time ago,
[46:52.320 --> 46:55.960]  but the iPhone has just steadfastly not.
[46:55.960 --> 46:57.320]  And there's gotta be a reason, right?
[46:57.320 --> 47:00.400]  There's gotta be a reason that they don't wanna do that.
[47:00.400 --> 47:02.360]  Otherwise they could have put it on the Pro models
[47:02.360 --> 47:04.200]  a couple of years ago and just said,
[47:04.200 --> 47:05.600]  well, Pro models, they need more,
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.000]  we're doing USB-C up there.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.440]  And instead they just,
[47:08.440 --> 47:11.160]  it feels like they either don't want to,
[47:11.160 --> 47:13.320]  or they're not ready.
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.760]  But I think don't want to is probably the answer
[47:15.760 --> 47:17.800]  that when they remove the headphone jack,
[47:17.800 --> 47:19.760]  and you mentioned about like water ingress
[47:19.760 --> 47:20.800]  and things like that,
[47:20.800 --> 47:23.040]  you can make a waterproof USB-C device,
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.000]  but I think it is telling that Apple's one portless device,
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.240]  the Apple watch is the one where they actually say,
[47:28.240 --> 47:30.480]  yes, go ahead and swim with it.
[47:30.480 --> 47:35.480]  Like it would be easier for them to do true waterproofing
[47:35.480 --> 47:37.000]  if they could get rid of that port
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.280]  and they built MagSafe
[47:38.280 --> 47:40.560]  so that they've got a new charging infrastructure.
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.240]  Like all the pieces are there to say,
[47:43.240 --> 47:45.520]  they don't want another port on the iPhone.
[47:45.520 --> 47:47.320]  They think the port is the problem
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.720]  for a device as mobile as an iPhone.
[47:51.720 --> 47:53.560]  I think if you showed the typical user
[47:53.560 --> 47:55.800]  and the problem with the,
[47:55.800 --> 47:57.760]  I think that there's a very big difference.
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.600]  I think with iPad Pro and MacBook Pros,
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.600]  the people who buy them tend to be more lowercase P Pro.
[48:08.120 --> 48:08.960]  They tend to,
[48:08.960 --> 48:11.560]  the reason they're spending more for these higher priced,
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.640]  more capable, faster devices
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.440]  is that they are more,
[48:18.440 --> 48:20.080]  they actually need them for their work
[48:20.080 --> 48:20.920]  or they're more,
[48:20.920 --> 48:22.400]  they're just enthusiasts,
[48:22.400 --> 48:23.640]  technical enthusiasts.
[48:23.640 --> 48:25.520]  And they want the better product.
[48:25.520 --> 48:26.600]  They want a nicer product.
[48:26.600 --> 48:27.880]  And they're willing to pay for it.
[48:27.880 --> 48:30.520]  And they're willing to put up with things like new ports
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.400]  and getting new cables and stuff like that.
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.680]  The problem with the iPhone is even with the Pro,
[48:34.680 --> 48:37.400]  and I think it's great that they really are
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.320]  differentiating the iPhone's Pro from the non-Pros
[48:41.320 --> 48:43.320]  with actual, not just decoration,
[48:43.320 --> 48:46.320]  like shiny steel instead of matte aluminum,
[48:47.360 --> 48:49.200]  but actual technical improvements,
[48:49.200 --> 48:51.840]  like a seriously more advanced camera system.
[48:53.040 --> 48:53.960]  I think that's great.
[48:53.960 --> 48:55.800]  And I really think that that justifies
[48:55.800 --> 48:57.640]  like the $200 price difference
[48:57.640 --> 49:00.600]  from an iPhone 13 to an iPhone 13 Pro.
[49:00.600 --> 49:01.960]  I think you get $200.
[49:01.960 --> 49:04.960]  I said this on my last episode with Matthew Panzorino.
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.320]  It's $200 worth of camera alone in there.
[49:08.320 --> 49:11.920]  And if you combine it with the ProMotion display,
[49:11.920 --> 49:14.080]  you really feel like you're getting $200 worth
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.160]  of actual technical, even if they looked identical
[49:18.160 --> 49:20.840]  and they both use the exact same stainless steel
[49:20.840 --> 49:21.960]  or aluminum finish.
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.040]  You feel like there's $200 worth of stuff in there.
[49:25.040 --> 49:28.720]  The problem for Apple is there's a gazillion people
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.400]  who are not Pro at all who just buy the Pro models
[49:31.400 --> 49:32.920]  because they either want the camera
[49:32.920 --> 49:34.960]  or they just want the nicest iPhone
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.200]  or they like the color better.
[49:38.200 --> 49:40.360]  People just go in and go, I like that color better.
[49:40.360 --> 49:41.920]  And they're like, well, that's $200 more.
[49:41.920 --> 49:43.760]  And they're like, well, okay, sure.
[49:43.760 --> 49:44.600]  I don't care.
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.240]  And so I still think, and the thing to me is
[49:50.240 --> 49:53.560]  if they switched now, they switched with Lightning
[49:53.560 --> 49:55.960]  and then they kept it for at least nine years, right?
[49:55.960 --> 49:59.760]  It would be 2012 through 2021 are all Lightning.
[49:59.760 --> 50:01.320]  And so if they switch next year,
[50:01.320 --> 50:03.360]  it would be nine years of Lightning.
[50:03.360 --> 50:04.960]  If they switch to USB-C,
[50:04.960 --> 50:08.280]  is USB-C going to be around for the next nine years?
[50:08.280 --> 50:09.720]  I don't think so.
[50:09.720 --> 50:11.600]  Or at least I don't think it's gonna be state of the art.
[50:11.600 --> 50:13.000]  I really don't.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.440]  This is where I think they were segueing into the EC thing.
[50:16.440 --> 50:20.600]  Yeah, so I'm gonna give a little bit of a defense of USB-C
[50:20.600 --> 50:24.800]  because USB-C is as much a port
[50:24.800 --> 50:26.600]  as a connection standard, right?
[50:26.600 --> 50:28.960]  It is a port and it's way better than USB-A
[50:28.960 --> 50:31.840]  because you can plug it in either way and it doesn't matter.
[50:31.840 --> 50:33.320]  And we already have seen
[50:33.320 --> 50:34.800]  that there's all sorts of kinds of things
[50:34.800 --> 50:36.800]  that use that port, including USB-C,
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.480]  various versions of USB-3 that run on that USB-C port,
[50:40.480 --> 50:42.720]  Thunderbolt that runs on that USB-C port.
[50:42.720 --> 50:45.640]  And my counter argument would be the USB-A port
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.840]  because the USB-A port basically came into existence
[50:49.840 --> 50:54.840]  in the real world in 1998 when the iMac came out.
[50:55.080 --> 50:58.960]  And there's still USB-A stuff in 2021, okay?
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.960]  So that USB-A has had like a 24 year run of that connector.
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.840]  Now what has run over it has changed
[51:06.840 --> 51:08.800]  and it reached its limit at some point.
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.040]  But that connector was able to do USB-3 kind of speeds
[51:13.040 --> 51:16.440]  and that's a far cry from what was there in 1998.
[51:16.440 --> 51:18.960]  It's also true that, and I did this,
[51:18.960 --> 51:21.280]  you can take a hockey puck mouse from the original iMac
[51:21.280 --> 51:24.880]  and plug it in to my iMac Pro that's got USB-A ports
[51:24.880 --> 51:26.560]  and it works, it works.
[51:26.560 --> 51:27.680]  Or you can use a little adapter
[51:27.680 --> 51:29.040]  and plug it into one of the new iMacs
[51:29.040 --> 51:31.520]  that only has USB-C and it totally works.
[51:31.520 --> 51:34.520]  So I guess what I'm saying is I kind of believe
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.400]  that as ports go, the USB-C plug that shape
[51:39.400 --> 51:43.280]  will probably be with us for a while, at least potentially.
[51:43.280 --> 51:45.200]  Because within that plug,
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.040]  you can evolve the connection technology
[51:47.040 --> 51:48.040]  and we've already seen that.
[51:48.040 --> 51:51.440]  Like USB-C has USB-3, it has Thunderbolt,
[51:51.440 --> 51:52.560]  like there's a whole bunch of stuff
[51:52.560 --> 51:54.320]  that can live inside that plug.
[51:54.320 --> 51:56.840]  And the plug might survive for a long time
[51:56.840 --> 51:59.680]  because the USB-A plug, which was a terrible plug,
[51:59.680 --> 52:01.840]  survived for an awful long time.
[52:01.840 --> 52:03.760]  So I think that would be my counter argument
[52:03.760 --> 52:08.760]  is USB-C as a pretty generic thing you stick in a hole
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.600]  might have legs.
[52:12.600 --> 52:14.880]  That's not to say that I think that it should be mandatory,
[52:14.880 --> 52:18.160]  but I do think that there's at least a lot of innovation
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.920]  that can probably happen inside that plug
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.960]  where you're changing what, you know,
[52:22.960 --> 52:24.240]  and there'll be incompatibilities
[52:24.240 --> 52:25.480]  and everybody will get frustrated
[52:25.480 --> 52:26.840]  because they'll be like, what do you mean?
[52:26.840 --> 52:29.320]  I can only plug this into this kind of port.
[52:29.320 --> 52:30.880]  It plugs into this other computer.
[52:30.880 --> 52:32.640]  Why, you know, you take a Thunderbolt thing
[52:32.640 --> 52:34.760]  and plug it into an iPad Air and it won't work
[52:34.760 --> 52:37.560]  because it only does USB-C, it doesn't do Thunderbolt.
[52:37.560 --> 52:39.080]  Like there's a lot of frustration,
[52:39.080 --> 52:41.960]  but at least the plug is the one plug.
[52:41.960 --> 52:44.520]  And so that would be my defense of USB-C
[52:44.520 --> 52:48.560]  is USB-A had a long run, USB-C is actually way better
[52:48.560 --> 52:50.920]  just because you don't have to plug it in twice
[52:50.920 --> 52:52.040]  to plug it in.
[52:52.040 --> 52:53.920]  And it may survive on that
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.280]  even as the underlying technology
[52:56.280 --> 52:58.520]  using that plug keeps changing.
[52:58.520 --> 53:03.520]  I think you're right that we'll see USB-C sockets for...
[53:04.320 --> 53:05.760]  The rest of our lives.
[53:05.760 --> 53:07.040]  Maybe the rest of our lives.
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.960]  And it might be on the,
[53:08.960 --> 53:11.000]  it might be the output of chargers
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.680]  that you stick in the wall for a very long time.
[53:13.680 --> 53:17.200]  I just do not believe that nine years from now
[53:17.200 --> 53:19.120]  it'll be the best Apple can do
[53:19.120 --> 53:22.440]  for the thing that you use for data
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.640]  to get out of your iPhone.
[53:23.640 --> 53:24.920]  Now, maybe it'll all be wired.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.120]  Maybe the plan is it'll all be wireless
[53:27.120 --> 53:30.040]  and they've got a new wireless thing in mind
[53:30.040 --> 53:34.720]  that will transfer things like humongous ProRes video
[53:34.720 --> 53:38.560]  at speeds that are comparable to Thunderbolt
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.600]  or something like that, wireless,
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.600]  or maybe it's some other...
[53:42.600 --> 53:46.520]  But Apple likes to make new plugs
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.080]  and the new plugs they make
[53:48.080 --> 53:53.080]  are to serve purposes of this is really nice.
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.120]  And a great new example
[53:55.120 --> 53:57.480]  is the way you plug the new iMacs,
[53:57.480 --> 54:02.480]  the 24-inch iMac, M1 iMacs into power.
[54:02.880 --> 54:06.400]  And you know what else they really, really like of late?
[54:06.400 --> 54:09.120]  Magnets, magnets.
[54:10.960 --> 54:13.040]  Every time they come out with something else with magnets,
[54:13.040 --> 54:14.880]  I always think of that scene in The Graduate
[54:14.880 --> 54:17.360]  where the guy comes up to Dustin Hoffman and he goes,
[54:17.360 --> 54:19.800]  I got one, I got one word for you.
[54:19.800 --> 54:20.640]  Plastics.
[54:20.640 --> 54:21.960]  Plastics, that's the future of plastics.
[54:21.960 --> 54:23.240]  I wanna go to some...
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.280]  If I time traveled back like 10 years ago,
[54:25.280 --> 54:27.600]  I'd go to somebody and I'd say, I got one word for you.
[54:27.600 --> 54:29.320]  Magnets.
[54:29.320 --> 54:31.920]  It's all magnets all the way down.
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.080]  I would love something like MagSafe,
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.680]  but like the MagSafe from Macs of yore,
[54:41.680 --> 54:44.640]  but tinier, like way tinier.
[54:44.640 --> 54:45.480]  Yeah.
[54:45.480 --> 54:48.440]  And you know, and the...
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.520]  What do you call the thing on the back of the iPad Pros?
[54:50.520 --> 54:52.160]  The data connector?
[54:52.160 --> 54:53.200]  The smart connector.
[54:53.200 --> 54:54.360]  The smart connector.
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.640]  Something like that.
[54:55.640 --> 54:57.520]  And it could do charging.
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.280]  It could do data at very high speeds.
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.280]  The iMac, 24-inch iMac, I mean, they have that.
[55:04.280 --> 55:07.800]  They basically in the wire that's going there
[55:07.800 --> 55:09.720]  is also ethernet.
[55:09.720 --> 55:12.080]  And then the ethernet's on the brick.
[55:12.080 --> 55:14.240]  So they're already sort of like headed in that direction.
[55:14.240 --> 55:17.280]  So the idea is what's great about magnets
[55:17.280 --> 55:18.760]  is that they hold fast,
[55:18.760 --> 55:20.520]  but they also hold properly aligned
[55:20.520 --> 55:23.520]  so that all the pins are touching like a port,
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.040]  but it's a magnet.
[55:25.040 --> 55:27.800]  And you could then do data and power over it.
[55:27.800 --> 55:28.640]  Yeah.
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.640]  And I wonder looking at the EU EC regulations
[55:34.080 --> 55:37.240]  and they carve out a big exception for wireless,
[55:37.240 --> 55:38.720]  which still drives me nuts
[55:38.720 --> 55:40.040]  that we call these things wireless
[55:40.040 --> 55:42.120]  when they have to be touching, right?
[55:42.120 --> 55:45.120]  Just it's like, I know that it's one of my own.
[55:46.080 --> 55:48.800]  It's like my crusade against Ariel versus Helvet.
[55:48.800 --> 55:50.200]  Well, more people care about that,
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.080]  but it really bothers me that we call wireless charging
[55:55.080 --> 55:57.680]  this thing that you have to be in physical contact.
[55:57.680 --> 55:59.680]  Like we wouldn't call Wi-Fi wireless
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.320]  if you had to have your device touching a certain,
[56:04.320 --> 56:07.440]  like if you lose contact, you lose your network.
[56:07.440 --> 56:09.560]  Well, nobody would call that wireless networking,
[56:09.560 --> 56:11.680]  but we call it wireless charging.
[56:11.680 --> 56:15.560]  But anyway, inductive charging, the AKA wireless
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.160]  is accepted in the EC guidelines.
[56:19.160 --> 56:22.840]  So a device that only charges by what they call wireless,
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.960]  which is inductive, is exempt
[56:24.960 --> 56:28.000]  and wouldn't need to include USB-C.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.020]  And it's not like they have the Apple Watch in mind,
[56:31.020 --> 56:33.920]  I don't think, but the Apple Watch therefore
[56:33.920 --> 56:35.080]  would fall under that.
[56:35.080 --> 56:37.380]  And it's not like the EC is proposing
[56:37.380 --> 56:41.000]  that Apple has to add a USB-C port to Apple Watch.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.360]  Their description already says that such a,
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.280]  it's products that have charging ports
[56:47.280 --> 56:49.840]  have to include USB-C.
[56:49.840 --> 56:51.900]  Would something like what we're saying,
[56:51.900 --> 56:55.380]  like a smart connector with a magnetic connection,
[56:55.380 --> 57:00.380]  like maybe two little smart connector things
[57:00.560 --> 57:01.640]  on the bottom of the phone,
[57:01.640 --> 57:03.900]  but then the cable would connect magnetically,
[57:03.900 --> 57:07.180]  would that count as a port or would it count as wireless?
[57:08.760 --> 57:11.120]  I think it's a question like if you put data
[57:11.120 --> 57:12.960]  on a magnetic connector,
[57:12.960 --> 57:14.820]  even on the MagSafe that we've currently got,
[57:14.820 --> 57:16.960]  if there was data in there,
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.840]  would the European Commission say,
[57:19.840 --> 57:22.120]  no, now it's not just charging,
[57:22.120 --> 57:24.920]  now you're doing data and you should do USB-C instead.
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.200]  And from their vantage point, I would say also,
[57:28.200 --> 57:29.700]  what they don't want to have happen,
[57:29.700 --> 57:31.760]  and I think it's an admirable goal,
[57:31.760 --> 57:35.240]  is they don't want everybody to go to charging paddles
[57:35.240 --> 57:37.360]  and have 80 different charging paddles,
[57:37.360 --> 57:39.420]  each one for an individual phone model, right?
[57:39.420 --> 57:42.560]  They don't want that kind of a terrible kind of thing.
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.940]  The thing is though that the Qi charging is a standard
[57:46.940 --> 57:49.640]  and what Apple is doing, and this is unlike lightning,
[57:49.640 --> 57:52.840]  Apple is building on top of Qi.
[57:52.840 --> 57:56.800]  So they've got Qi charging support, any charger will do,
[57:56.800 --> 57:58.840]  but then MagSafe does a little bit more.
[57:58.840 --> 58:01.320]  And that might be their model going forward is,
[58:01.320 --> 58:03.600]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we got the standard,
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.600]  but standard plus is us and we do more with MagSafe
[58:09.320 --> 58:11.680]  than you get from Qi.
[58:11.680 --> 58:12.900]  And would that work?
[58:12.900 --> 58:16.840]  Is that the kind of Apple like game that would pass muster
[58:16.840 --> 58:19.560]  as being like, all right, well, you support the standard
[58:19.560 --> 58:21.040]  and we're not gonna stop you from doing more
[58:21.040 --> 58:23.440]  than the standard as long as you support the standard.
[58:23.440 --> 58:25.440]  Or are they gonna be like, hold on, wait a second,
[58:25.440 --> 58:27.400]  you mean if you want to transfer data,
[58:27.400 --> 58:30.320]  you have to buy a proprietary cable that only Apple sells
[58:30.320 --> 58:32.520]  and would they make a stink about that?
[58:32.520 --> 58:34.180]  And I don't know, I mean, that's the problem
[58:34.180 --> 58:37.080]  with regulation like this, is that like,
[58:37.080 --> 58:39.560]  I appreciate the idea that we don't want a wasteland
[58:39.560 --> 58:42.040]  where every phone has its own proprietary charger,
[58:42.040 --> 58:45.240]  but I also don't appreciate the idea that everything
[58:45.240 --> 58:48.200]  in technology has to basically arrest its development
[58:48.200 --> 58:51.360]  because a bureaucratic group has decided
[58:51.360 --> 58:53.920]  that we've reached nirvana in 2021.
[58:53.920 --> 58:56.080]  They're regulating a thing that the market
[58:56.080 --> 58:57.000]  has already solved.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.800]  And sure, it didn't resolve down to one,
[58:59.800 --> 59:03.360]  it resolved down to two and everybody's fine with it.
[59:03.360 --> 59:04.920]  Nobody's clamoring for this.
[59:04.920 --> 59:07.560]  In fact, if you look at the charger side of it,
[59:07.560 --> 59:10.560]  it's resolved down to one, like there is no doubt,
[59:10.560 --> 59:13.920]  like the new Kindles just got announced like a week ago,
[59:13.920 --> 59:16.880]  Kindle Paperwhite and they've got USB on them, USB-C.
[59:16.880 --> 59:18.240]  Thank God. For years,
[59:18.240 --> 59:22.280]  it's been the awful micro USB. Oh, I know.
[59:22.280 --> 59:25.640]  And it's like, okay, it is gonna happen
[59:25.640 --> 59:29.240]  that every device really on the charging side,
[59:29.240 --> 59:30.560]  all of these little devices,
[59:30.560 --> 59:33.600]  almost everything's gonna have USB-C anyway, and it's good.
[59:33.600 --> 59:35.400]  And all the chargers that they're gonna sell
[59:35.400 --> 59:37.120]  are gonna be USB-C.
[59:37.120 --> 59:38.780]  Even if it's lightning on the other end,
[59:38.780 --> 59:42.040]  like the world has already kind of adopted this,
[59:42.040 --> 59:47.040]  so it's unclear to me why we need more than that.
[59:47.240 --> 59:49.160]  And because, I mean,
[59:49.160 --> 59:51.160]  when you and Ben talk about this on Stratechery,
[59:51.160 --> 59:53.960]  it's like sometimes markets don't work.
[59:53.960 --> 59:55.620]  Markets do need to be regulated.
[59:55.620 --> 59:57.080]  There need to be rules.
[59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.080]  But the power of markets is that in ideal circumstances,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.960]  you get a result like this, which is finally,
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.880]  after a lot of waste, after 15 years of dumb stuff,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.800]  we have a single plug that pretty much everybody's
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.480]  gonna use, and that part is great.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.360]  USB-C is gonna be with us for the rest of our lives,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.920]  even if it's only in just every gadget
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.960]  that charges is USB-C.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.400]  The line from somebody at the EC,
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.960]  I think it was the same clown who said
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.000]  that if Apple wants to still include lightning,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.120]  they can just put two ports on their iPhone.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.840]  Salt.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.000]  It's like he said, we're not preventing
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.240]  anybody from innovating.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.760]  But the second half of that that goes unsaid
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.920]  is we're not preventing anybody from innovating.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.680]  We're just saying you can't invent anything better
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.720]  than the rest of the competition,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.800]  which is actually innovation.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.800]  Because I'm saying, but this to me is what Apple does.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.200]  And it's like you mentioned it.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.600]  Like when lightning debuted nine years ago,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.960]  it was so much better than any other charger
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.020]  on any other phone or phone-like device
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.680]  than anybody had ever seen.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.080]  It was so much better than micro-USB
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.840]  and so much better than the 30-pin adapter
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.560]  that Apple replaced it with.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.440]  And it's like what if Apple has something in mind
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.040]  that does to lightning what lightning did
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.800]  to the 30-pin adapter?
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.920]  That and also would be way better than USB-C.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.000]  And of, you know, maybe.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.660]  Well, yeah, and my guess is that if Apple puts a port,
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.320]  they'll just use USB-C because they seem happy with it.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.080]  And they could do Thunderbolt in there.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.240]  And like, I think the connector is not the problem.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.360]  I think it's exactly what we've been talking about here,
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.900]  which is Apple seems to be looking at the port and saying,
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.520]  but what if we did this through something that was external
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  that I wouldn't have to worry about ingress into there
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.280]  or the port hardware failing
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.680]  because there are no moving parts
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.480]  and it's aligned magnetically.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.760]  And if you combine that one physical combination
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.520]  or connection type with the wireless stuff that we've got,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.160]  we've got this solved and we don't need it anymore.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.780]  The one thing, I know you've set up an iMac too,
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.600]  and it's like plugging the iMac thing
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.920]  into the back of the new iMac is fun.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.880]  It's so satisfying, oh my God.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.640]  I did it, and it's like I'm sitting there setting it up.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.600]  I'm like, I can't, you know, you get a new computer
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.560]  and you're excited and, you know,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.520]  and you also, you know, you get these review units,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.400]  you know, you have a deadline,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400]  so you kind of want to get it going and, you know, start,
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.320]  and it's like, instead of wanting to turn it on,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.480]  I'm like, I'm just gonna sit here and play with the plug.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.400]  And it's like, ch-chunk, ch-chunk, chunk, chunk.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.680]  But like you mentioned, that thing,
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.780]  and I think it's really interesting,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.800]  is magnetically connected, lots and lots of power
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.760]  and high-speed data,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.720]  because that's how the ethernet comes in.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.200]  Does it do gigabit ethernet or?
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.200]  Yeah, so gigabit ethernet speeds over a magnetic connection.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.120]  Yeah, I think they're literally, you know,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.640]  I think they're literally putting the ethernet wires
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.640]  and attaching them to pins on the back.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.760]  So it's like they just hardwired it in,
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.680]  but I think this opens up,
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.380]  you get a little bit of maybe this angle of Apple's vision
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.240]  for the future, which Apple's never done docking stations,
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.800]  but you could argue that this iMac
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.360]  kind of has a docking station,
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.040]  and it is one way to make your computer thinner
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.120]  and cleaner and lighter,
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.040]  and all of those things that Apple likes,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.040]  is to say, hide that plug behind your desk.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.680]  And I start to wonder about like a future,
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.180]  a bigger iMac, or maybe they'll call it iMac Pro.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.680]  It's like, I really like that brick on that iMac,
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.480]  and I start to wonder, could there be optionally
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.560]  like more stuff on that brick?
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.280]  Because I got a bunch of crap under my desk,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.440]  like cables snaking out of my iMac
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.120]  to hubs under my desk in order to do that.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.340]  And I wonder if Apple could be like, nah, we get it.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.480]  We don't want those ports on the back of the computer either.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.520]  We put them on the brick.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.720]  And on a laptop, what would it be like?
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.560]  It'd be a little different,
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.780]  because you don't want to like yank out your hard drive
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.640]  or something when somebody brushes against your computer.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.080]  But there is stuff like when you're docked at a desk
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.320]  with your laptop,
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.280]  that it would certainly be a lot cleaner
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.100]  if you could do your MagSafe thing,
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.040]  and then everything kind of did the right thing
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.600]  and mounted the drives and did all of that stuff.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.440]  I don't know how much of this they,
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.040]  I'm sure they've talked about it,
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.440]  but how much of this will actually come to fruition?
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.040]  But I do think there's some truth in that
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.380]  of like Apple realizing that one way
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.640]  to get their idealized products
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.080]  is to push some of this junk like down the wire,
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.900]  if they can, and to make a cleaner experience
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.420]  kind of at the little beautiful object
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.860]  that Apple has made and sold to you.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.760]  Right, and they're absolutely not going to do it.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.760]  And wouldn't work anyway by going to the USB-C consortium
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.000]  before they unveiled the products and saying,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.680]  here's the idea we've got fellas,
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.640]  we're going to do this and here's some schematics.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.000]  Can you imagine that iMac with like a USB-C port
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.360]  on the back and the center is like, yep, there's your power.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.240]  Just plug this thing in and it's USB-C.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.680]  Like I just can't envision it.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.580]  And that's what they do on the laptops right now.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.800]  And it's fine.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.360]  But the rumors are that they're also trying to not do that
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.760]  in the future, that they really do think magnetic attach,
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.160]  MagSafe for laptops is superior, which I would agree.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.040]  I bought one of those things just like Syracuse.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.440]  It's actually the same one that he bought.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.080]  I have one of those little things that pushes
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.280]  into the USB-C port on my laptop, that's magnetic.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.400]  And then it's got a little magnetic cable.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.880]  And so I'm back to MagSafe even despite Apple
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.040]  because it's superior.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.200]  It's a better thing for laptops, sorry.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.040]  It really is.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.320]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.200]  and thank our next sponsor.

[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.960]  I used my last show with Panzareno
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.780]  to talk about the iPhone 13s in detail,
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:14.680]  but I was intrigued.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.600]  I listened to the latest version of Upgrade with you
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.840]  and the melodious voiced Mike Hurley
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.680]  speaking about your iPhone 13 purchases.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.920]  Which iPhone 13 did you buy for yourself, Jason Stone?
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.840]  I bought an iPhone 13 mini for myself
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.760]  because the size and the weight and my use cases
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.560]  sort of over-rided the extra camera
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.200]  and the promotion.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.880]  It's like, those are nice.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.680]  I mean, Mike was aghast when I said this too,
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.120]  because he's all in on a Pro Max
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.360]  and he loves promotion and all that.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.880]  And the promotion's good.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.400]  I felt like I had to keep saying to Mike,
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.880]  no, promotion is good.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.040]  I just, little phone is better for me.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.300]  I prefer better phone.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.720]  And really the test was,
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.280]  because like you, I got four iPhones.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.880]  I got every model and I've been spending time with them.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.440]  And promotion is good,
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.440]  but what I realized was when I went back to the mini,
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.020]  I didn't miss it.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.320]  And I was relieved to be in the smaller phone.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.680]  So I realized that the mini really is the right one for me.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.360]  And I'm gonna live it up this year
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.960]  because all rumors suggest
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.520]  that it's not coming back next year.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.760]  So I'm gonna enjoy it while I can.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.520]  I think it's entirely possible is an aging eyes thing
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.480]  and that I would have been more enamored
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.480]  of the higher than 60 frame or Hertz refresh rates
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.520]  even 10 years ago than I am now.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.480]  I do see it.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.280]  And you even mentioned on the show,
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.760]  you really see it when you're scrolling
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.440]  because as you're scrolling,
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.400]  like you're reading a long article on a webpage
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.760]  and as you're scrolling,
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.940]  you can still read the text as it's moving.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.040]  If you read content while you scroll your iPhone,
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.320]  you need promotion because it is vastly superior.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.280]  I generally don't do that.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.200]  And maybe that's that I've trained myself not to do that
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.840]  on my iPhone, but I don't do that.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.400]  And so I don't really miss it that much.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.800]  But boy, when you start to scroll
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.540]  and you realize that the text never breaks up,
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.640]  it just is crystal clear as you scroll.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.720]  It is spectacularly good.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.740]  And you said that, and I was like, that's a good test.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.800]  And I was actually out and I stopped on the sidewalk
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.880]  and I was just opened something and I was scrolling.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.500]  I was like, yeah, I can kind of read that.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.120]  And then I got home and I actually went to the iPad mini.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.040]  It was just the nearest thing.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.220]  And I was like scrolling it.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.400]  And which does not have promotion.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.520]  I was like, no, I cannot read that while I scroll.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.880]  And I'm like, I'm okay with that.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.560]  To me, the big win with promotion
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.320]  is the battery life change or advantages
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  that it extends battery life further.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.760]  Like if you're streaming video
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.560]  because of the lower refresh rates,
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.140]  not the visually impressive wow,
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.960]  you can read while you scroll,
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.920]  but the, hey, your battery lasts even longer.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.800]  Cause if you're watching a 30 frames per second
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.240]  Apple TV plus show,
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.980]  your screen only refreshes 30 frames per second.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.160]  But all of the iPhones have an enormous
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.760]  battery life jump this year.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.400]  It is the most, it's kind of amazing.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.280]  Like I linked to the YouTube video
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.880]  where the 13 mini that you bought
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.400]  has longer battery life than last year's
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.040]  regular sized iPhone 12.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.520]  That's bananas.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.480]  And remember last year and the year before
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.000]  were pretty good in terms of battery life improvements.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.240]  So if you look at the sort of like three or four year,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.200]  like if you're coming from a four or five year old phone,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.160]  the battery life will stun you.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.680]  Plus your old battery was probably bad.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.880]  Cause it's old.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.440]  But even if it was fresh,
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.280]  the battery life improvements will stun you.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.200]  And that was part of it too.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.960]  Is like the mini last year didn't get great battery life,
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.760]  but it kind of didn't matter cause I didn't go anywhere
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.600]  cause it was a pandemic.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.360]  But that makes that phone a lot better.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.280]  Like having a longer battery life on the mini
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.120]  makes it a lot better.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.600]  And that's why I think we talked about the promotion stuff
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.440]  and I'm sure promotion is a huge part
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.080]  of the battery life savings,
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.860]  being able to crank down the frame rate on those pro models,
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.320]  but like obviously the A15 and the fact that they've kind of
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320]  like put more battery into these,
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.400]  like there, I think it's probably three, four,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.360]  five different little reasons that added together,
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.080]  netted them the huge battery life.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:29.920]  But that's great.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.200]  Cause like, I feel like camera and battery
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.440]  are the two features that matter the most in a phone.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.440]  I care, it's not that I don't care about promotion,
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.560]  but for me, it's so little of a deal.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.320]  I bought the 13 pro this year for the camera
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.280]  and only for the camera.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.080]  And there's no other reasons.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.080]  And if the regular 13 was just had the 13 pro
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.640]  three lens camera system,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.640]  then I would have bought the regular 13
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.600]  cause I prefer the less, the lighter weight.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.800]  And I prefer the actual,
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.580]  I actually prefer the feel of the aluminum.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.240]  And I prefer the feel of the glossy,
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.340]  therefore grippy glass back,
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.740]  as opposed to the slippery frosted back.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.040]  The promotion doesn't make me want to buy it.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.200]  I wonder what they're going to do next year,
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.900]  because I feel like for this generation,
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.560]  the 12 and the 13,
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.480]  and I know everybody's got a different opinion style wise,
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.160]  but I feel like that the cheaper phones are better,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.900]  like look better and feel better.
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.200]  I think that the bright colored backs
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.080]  and the surgical stainless steel band and all that,
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.320]  it's like, I kind of don't like it.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.640]  I think it's kind of gaudy and it picks up fingerprints.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.880]  And like, I really liked that aluminum band.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.200]  I just, I like the,
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.220]  I like the cheaper phones and I agree with you.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.440]  I thought I would miss the telephoto more than I have
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.480]  for the last year,
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.180]  which is why I also was sort of accepting that.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.040]  But yes, I would love it
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.400]  if the cheaper phones had the three camera stack,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.220]  but they don't.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.840]  And like, it wasn't enough for me to make the switch
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.680]  since I was also getting the size difference.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.360]  To your point among,
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.980]  I don't know if they sent everybody the same four phones.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.960]  I got the, in my review units,
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.960]  I got the mini in midnight, which is there.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.640]  It's sort of near black.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.320]  The regular size 13 in blue.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.560]  Mine was pink, which is a joke.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.760]  Cause it looks white to me cause I'm colorblind.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.040]  And I had this moment where I had to show it to my wife
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.200]  and say, is this pink?
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.440]  And she says, oh yeah, that's pink.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.900]  Oh my God, I don't know, which one to me.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.240]  I got the regular one in blue.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.240]  I got the 13 Pro, which I still have in my pocket in gold.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.160]  Yes, same.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.820]  Which C3PO style.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.560]  And then the, I think they gave everybody
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.520]  the Pro Max in Sierra blue.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.360]  In Sierra blue.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.600]  Because Sierra blue is their big new thing.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.940]  But when I took them, unboxed them,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.480]  both my wife and my son,
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.040]  and my son, my wife is just like,
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.540]  just has an eye for what's pretty.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:00.380]  And she's a very heavy iPhone, especially iPad user.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.220]  She uses her iPad way more than I do.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.900]  But her thoughts when she sees these new phones
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.960]  are what looks great to her.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.000]  And my son is more technically minded.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.340]  But they both thought that the blue iPhone 13 was the Pro,
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.520]  because it looks so cool.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.220]  And I was like, no, that's not,
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.940]  that's not the Pro, that's the regular one.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.780]  They're like, what?
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.740]  That's the coolest looking phone of the bunch.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.980]  That blue is awesome.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.460]  So I did get the midnight,
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.020]  and people are telling me that midnight
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.300]  has a slight blue undertone to it,
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.020]  and it's slightly different than last year's.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:45.900]  I don't know, folks.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.860]  I got a black 12 mini and a midnight 13 mini.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.780]  It looked identical to me.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.820]  And blue is not one of those colors that I can't see.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.980]  And they look identical.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.820]  But the one I bought was the blue one,
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.780]  and I love it.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.060]  Oh my God, it is the coolest color, in my opinion.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.140]  I'm always, my rule is I always buy the black,
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.860]  and the one year where I kind of like,
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.660]  my brain froze, and I got like an edge condition,
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.660]  and the Gruber OS crashed was the iPhone 7,
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.960]  where there was black and jet black.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.460]  Because of my rule of just buying the black one,
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.940]  it was like a buffer overflow.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.660]  And I think I made the wrong decision.
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.540]  I bought jet black, and in hindsight I regret it
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.260]  and wish I'd bought the flat black.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:38.420]  I was too, I got too caught up in the shiny.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.380]  I think that the flat black, I regret it.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.860]  And mainly for touch reasons.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.140]  I think the flat black, but anyway.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.180]  I just always buy the black one.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:52.100]  The one year I came closest to not getting the gray
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:56.180]  was the year, I think it was the iPhone 11.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:00.220]  Yeah, the 11, where they had sort of a Boba Fett style
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.300]  green, blue type thing.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.380]  Oh yeah, like midnight green or whatever it was.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.820]  Yeah.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.860]  The pros had those two kind of we're gonna put color
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.740]  in our pro products, so that Apple doesn't apparently
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.340]  think pro products should be colored.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.180]  But then they did.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.820]  But they were very dark.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:17.660]  Yeah.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:22.380]  So I bought myself, of course, the boring 13 Pro
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.580]  in graphite because it's boring.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.020]  But if I were going to buy, last year I bought
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.100]  the black iPhone 12.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.060]  If I were gonna get the 12 again this year,
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.020]  or the 13, or the 13 mini, this might be the year
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.380]  where I would have broken the streak and bought blue
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.220]  instead of midnight.
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.540]  Because that blue is one of the coolest things
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.700]  Apple's ever made.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.540]  And I know that I don't wanna repeat it,
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.380]  but you and Mike had a whole thing that there should be
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.540]  a color czar at Apple.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:52.500]  Whoever came up with that blue, the glass looks cool,
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.140]  the anodized aluminum is this.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.140]  It's not like, oh, it's gray with a tint of blue.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.740]  It's, you know, you look at it, if you tilt it right
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.220]  and you're in the sunlight, oh, it's nighttime
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.500]  and you're looking in, oh no, you won't see it.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.860]  It'll look silver to you.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:13.220]  You know, and I know that the Justin Long videos
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.020]  for, was it Dell or Microsoft, who the hell paid
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.980]  Justin Long to do sorta fake Mac PC ads?
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.820]  Was it Microsoft?
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.900]  I think it might have been Microsoft, Surface.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.780]  Yeah, and it was, or no, it was Microsoft promoting
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.660]  the whole lineup, the whole ecosystem.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.500]  Or no, it was Intel, it was Intel.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.380]  Oh, Intel.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.940]  Yeah, Intel, right.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.260]  But he was like, you know, you can get all these
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.580]  different colors and with the Mac, you can get gray
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.620]  or a slightly darker gray.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.540]  And you know what, that's an honest zinger.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.380]  That's, you know, those were sorta cringy commercials,
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.140]  but that's actually kinda true, you know.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.980]  People can listen to that episode of Upgrade
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.500]  where we talked about this, and I did go off on a rant
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.220]  about the colors are, because I feel like,
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.620]  every now and then I feel like Apple's got its act together
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.660]  when it comes to color.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.780]  And the 24-inch iMac was an example.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.300]  I'm like, yes, look, you're embracing these colors again.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.300]  I've wanted color in the Mac for so long now
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.700]  because they're fun and why not?
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.940]  And you always let somebody have silver or gray
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.220]  as an option because not everybody wants color,
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.540]  but to like let people have color in their lives.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:19.460]  And last year's iPhones, at least the 12s,
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.980]  not the 12 Pros, but the 12s were colorful.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.860]  This year's, there are fewer color options.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.140]  And then, you know, I know that people have been talking
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:31.520]  about the Sierra Blue, but I feel like our standards
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.780]  for color on a Pro iPhone are so low
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.340]  that people are praising that Sierra Blue.
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.700]  Sierra Blue in almost all lighting conditions
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.860]  I've taken it into.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.460]  It's just gray.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.020]  It's gray with a very faint cast of blue.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.700]  It's not like, and then you look at the 13 blue
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.820]  and you're like, oh, that's blue.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.100]  Not this kind of like, it's like how Starlight,
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.480]  it's like, it's silver, but very faintly yellow.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.260]  It's like, yeah, it's silver guys.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.720]  It's silver.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.220]  If you go into an Apple store with their,
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.980]  most of them or a lot of them are sun, you know,
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.100]  have sunlight if they're, you know,
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.500]  connected to the outside, you know,
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.960]  the ones aren't in a mall,
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.700]  but they all have beautiful light inside
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.740]  and it'll look blue in the Apple store.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740]  I guarantee you.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:20.740]  But in real life, in most cases, it looks silver.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.900]  It's real gray, silver.
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.700]  This is my larger point is, again, I don't,
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.420]  I think if you want a silver phone or a gray phone
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.940]  or whatever, like you should be able to buy it.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.940]  I'm not saying everybody must wear bright colors.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.900]  I'm just sort of saying that I'm a little baffled
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.660]  by Apple's kind of zigging and zagging about the idea
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.820]  that some products have bright colors
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.000]  and some products don't,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.980]  that the product names don't always match up.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.380]  We may be seeing them, like,
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.220]  by introducing midnight and starlight,
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:52.100]  they may actually try to be trying to define colors
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.040]  that will be the same across product lines down the road,
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.740]  unlike space gray, which has had like 15 different shades.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.580]  So, okay.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.860]  None of them dark enough though, except for like the-
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.380]  And then there's space black on the one watch
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.740]  that is like, what is that?
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.860]  Why is that in space?
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.700]  I don't know.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.000]  My point is I wish they would be more unified
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.880]  with their color choices and also a little bit bolder
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.100]  and braver because it really disappoints me
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:21.100]  that pro Macs and pro iPhones and pro iPads,
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.620]  they seem to think that what pro means is
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:28.220]  you can't have bold colors on them.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.780]  And that is so frustrating.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.800]  You didn't, until last year, I believe,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.740]  you couldn't get a smart folio case for the iPad Pro
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.300]  that wasn't white or gray.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.260]  Right.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.380]  And they finally did that.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.100]  And I have an orange case and I had a blue case for a while.
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.340]  Like they finally caved on the accessories,
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.940]  but like I just,
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.780]  I would like them to be a little more adventurous
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.280]  and consistent with their colors.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.020]  And also I hope next year
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:59.360]  that the iPhone pro models look really nice.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.100]  Cause they honestly have paled in comparison
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.160]  to the base models the last two years.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.980]  I'm running the show notes here
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:13.060]  from my iPad mini review unit, which they sent me in purple.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.180]  I don't know what color you got.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.160]  Starlight.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:21.160]  I've been using a purple iPad mini for two weeks now.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.900]  I'm using it right now.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.820]  And I cannot tell you how many times over those two weeks,
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.380]  I've, if there's one regret I have from my iPad review
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.220]  is that I didn't do a whole section
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.340]  about how boring the purple is.
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:38.900]  I keep forgetting it's purple.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:42.180]  I feel like it should be Minnesota Vikings purple, right?
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.140]  I should feel.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.760]  Again, it's more like a gray or silver
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.260]  with a very, very faint purple cast.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:52.300]  If it was like the blue iPhone 13,
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.600]  if it was that vivid of a purple,
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.500]  it would be like something that you could hold up
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.060]  to the Minnesota Vikings helmet.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.020]  And it would be like, yeah, that's like the same color.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.740]  And I think that would be really cool.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.980]  It probably wouldn't be what I would buy,
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.940]  but I think a lot of people would like to do that.
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.380]  And I think-
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.340]  My argument would be,
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.140]  if you're the kind of person who buys a purple computer,
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:13.020]  you actually want it to be purple.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.660]  Otherwise you wouldn't have bought purple.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.300]  You would have bought silver.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.940]  I can't tell you how many times over the last two weeks
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.660]  I forgot that this is purple.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.740]  And it's in my hand all the time, all the time.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.060]  And I'm like, oh yeah, it's purple.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.440]  It catches the light all of a sudden.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.700]  I'm like, oh yeah, purple.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:28.780]  I thought it was-
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.700]  Earlier this year, they made a big deal.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:31.880]  They did a whole ad campaign
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.940]  about how they added a purple iPhone 12.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.300]  Yes, yes.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.840]  And that was really purple.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.060]  Yes.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.860]  And I'll just point out as another footnote here,
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.460]  is there a purple iPhone 13?
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.300]  No, it's gone.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:45.140]  No, it's gone.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.260]  It's a really nice color.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.220]  They even had billboards dedicated to it.
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.860]  I don't know if it didn't sell or what the hell's going on,
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.500]  but they gotta get this.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.660]  They gotta follow-
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.500]  I don't understand.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.900]  They gotta get the colors are in there.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.180]  Colors are, appoint someone, I don't care.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.020]  Somebody really good.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.900]  I'm not eligible because I'm colorblind,
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.300]  but somebody who can see colors, all the colors,
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.500]  please get it to be consistent.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.860]  We haven't, nobody has seen them in person yet
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.180]  outside Apple, but I am excited to see
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.400]  the green Apple Watch Series 7,
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.760]  because the green Apple Watch Series 7
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.480]  looks like a seriously deep, rich green green
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.480]  that is to green what the blue is to the iPhone 13.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:33.620]  But then why not, why isn't there a green iPhone?
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.300]  Like, it looks like a really nice green.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:39.940]  I don't know if this is like a COVID thing.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.940]  Like they've just, you know, they're scrambling
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.900]  and they're not communicating with each other.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.740]  They're not collaborating.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.220]  It may be that for all of our talk about color,
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.980]  the truth is they have gotten their act together
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.340]  with color, but we just haven't,
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.780]  they haven't gotten it in sync yet.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.620]  And that's what I hope.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.300]  I hope that you look at that 24-inch iMac
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.220]  and you're like, aha, they got it.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.420]  But then I look at these products this fall
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.780]  and I'm like, nope, they don't got it.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.120]  So I don't know.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.060]  With as many listeners as we have,
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.540]  I'm sure that there's some people out there
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.180]  who bought the iPhone 13 in purple last year and love it,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.780]  and they're like, oh God, or iPhone 12.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.020]  And they're like, I love my purple iPhone 12.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.000]  I would like to buy a purple iPad
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.180]  and I'll feel the same way about it.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.180]  It's like, you are going to be very disappointed.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.020]  Yeah.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.940]  Because it's going to look gray in comparison.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.820]  And I don't know why the color is restrained
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.660]  on an iPad mini.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.500]  That again, like-
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.020]  I know, it's crying out for fun.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.660]  It should have the iMac colors.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.600]  It should have, it should be colored the color
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.140]  of the back of the iMacs.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.220]  Why is it not colored like the iMacs?
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.140]  Like, give me that.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.780]  I want a kooky orange iPad mini, right?
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.220]  And they're like, no, we're going to give you
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.140]  starlight, midnight, and this very faint purpley gray.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.180]  And that's what you get.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.020]  I don't get it.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:56.840]  I don't get it.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.660]  It is arguably the most fun iPad.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.620]  It's just a fun little size.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.460]  It's like getting-
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:03.300]  It is.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.780]  It's like when you get the little Snickers.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:05.980]  They literally call the little-
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.820]  Fun size.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.620]  They call it fun size, right?
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.660]  This is the fun size iPad.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:11.220]  It's the fun size iPad.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.460]  It's like, you could just buy,
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:15.180]  what if you don't even really need another iPad
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.740]  or another device in your life, but you're like,
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.580]  ah, what the hell?
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.500]  I'm going to spend 500 bucks to get an iPad mini.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.100]  You know, it's a treat.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.740]  It's a thing you play video games with.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.500]  It's a nice little portable size.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.500]  It's a fun size.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.620]  It should be fun colors.
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:28.460]  Yeah.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:29.620]  They are not fun colors.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.060]  I don't understand it.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.100]  I just don't understand it.
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.140]  For a company like Apple that seems to have
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.420]  at various points in its life and in its marketing,
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:44.180]  embrace fun, the restraint that sometimes comes out
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:47.060]  in their color choices for their products,
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.020]  I just don't get it.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.980]  Like I get that you want restrained choices
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.420]  because some people don't want big and bold,
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:56.620]  but why you don't give people the option
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.260]  of big bold style just, it baffles me.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.980]  So I hope they, I hope the iMac,
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:04.700]  I'm going to keep pointing at that iMac
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.700]  when their MacBook airs the next time
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.500]  I want them in all those colors,
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.780]  please don't water it down.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:11.860]  But my fear is that what we're going to get is
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:12.900]  starlight, right?
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.700]  Where it's like, it's really just silver or midnight
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.540]  and it's really just dark gray.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.220]  And that's not, I just like, those are fine,
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.140]  but if you're going to make a purple product,
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:23.980]  it should pop.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.580]  It should not just lay there like a purpley gray.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:30.260]  But then something like the blue iPhone 13 squeaks through
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.180]  and you're like that, that looks like the most amazing.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.940]  Red's not my color, but the product red is gorgeous too.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.500]  But like those are the two eye popping colors
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.860]  in the iPhone 13 and the rest of them are boring.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.340]  Speaking of the iPad.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.660]  Or pink, which I can't see.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.780]  Yeah, which you can't see.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.140]  iPad mini, another one from you and Mike,
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:56.140]  you were talking about the very odd home screen icon layout
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:01.340]  on the iPad mini where the icons are like
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.740]  one, two, three, four, five, six, six, six down
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.980]  when you're in portrait and four across.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.580]  And there's a huge amount of space around the bezels
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:18.580]  and in landscape, it's like you could fit a whole widget
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:24.620]  on either side of the space where the icons go.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.100]  Right, like there's easily plenty of margin space
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.020]  for the way that in last year's version of iPad OS
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.260]  you had a whole strip to put widgets.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.300]  There's that much room is still there.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.580]  It's just white space now.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.060]  It's very odd.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.820]  I did mention this in my review where it just feels
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:50.820]  like the iPad OS doesn't really treat this as an,
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.460]  it doesn't target, there's a lot of areas of the OS
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:02.100]  that just don't seem, the scaling done to make it fit
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.460]  on the iPad mini just seems like an afterthought.
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.380]  Like well, it's, I don't know what the percentage is.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.340]  Let's say it's 68% the size.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.700]  Just shrink it by 68%, put it there.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.060]  And then it just ends up like, huh.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:18.940]  I did the same thing you did where I transferred over,
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:22.700]  for me it was an 11 inch iPad Pro backup.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:27.100]  And I had my dock from the 11 inch iPad on the mini
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.740]  and the icons were like the size of a pencil eraser.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:33.740]  Oh yeah, you can put a lot of icons in that dock
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.260]  and then you rotate it vertically
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.340]  and they're all the size of your like fingernail.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.660]  Yeah, it's, you have to use your pinky.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.100]  You can't use your index finger.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.620]  You gotta switch to your pinky to poke at them.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.460]  Just-
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.300]  I'm glad it didn't stop them from making this product,
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:51.020]  but it does show you all the places where iPad OS
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.540]  has sort of like not been given attention.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:58.540]  And the larger issue about iPad OS 15 is that like,
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.300]  we were expecting when widgets didn't come
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.180]  like free form widgets, like on the iPhone
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.920]  to the iPad last year, that that was because Apple
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.760]  had something bigger in mind.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.700]  And because since day one, we've all looked
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.900]  at the iPad home screen and said, it's like this loose grid.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:18.820]  It's really like the iPhone grid with not a lot of effort
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.400]  to make it just also appear on the iPad.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.180]  And surely at some point Apple will rethink
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.260]  the home screen of the iPad and they never have.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.060]  And sure enough, iOS 15 comes out
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.300]  and it's literally not rethought at all
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.720]  other than they loosened the grid even more
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.500]  so that one app icon, which is much smaller
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.660]  than a small widget still takes the exact same amount
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:45.200]  of space as a small widget because there's so much padding
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.160]  around the app icon and they all flow around each other.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.700]  So if you try to place a widget,
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.220]  you have to chase the app icons around the screen
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.300]  in order to get them to flow,
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.040]  because now you've got these big wide widgets
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.540]  that are pushing all the icons around and you can,
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.200]  this is something that I mentioned on upgrade
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.660]  that turns out nobody knew.
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.100]  Apparently I'm the only one who noticed it,
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:07.740]  but you can order your widgets in a different location
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.180]  horizontally and vertically.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.100]  All your app icons still flow around them,
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.840]  but you can actually put them in different places,
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.880]  which is nice.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.260]  But like, I just, the disappointment of the fact
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:19.200]  that they seem to have still not figured out
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.180]  like a new take on the home screen for the iPad.
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.160]  And then when you see the iPad mini, you're like,
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.800]  oh wow, it's starting to break down, right?
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.980]  Like it really, they need to think of a new approach
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.820]  that really properly uses all their different screen sizes.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.420]  And this isn't it.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.620]  I mean, it's usable and I love the mini.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.360]  It's a lot of fun as a product,
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.700]  but there are those moments where you realize,
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:45.940]  oh, they didn't paint like behind this piece of furniture.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.780]  Right?
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.380]  There's like the unpainted part of the wall
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:50.060]  that now has been revealed
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.260]  because this product is shaped a little bit differently.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.140]  And suddenly you realize, oh, that's an oversight.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.900]  And instead the response was like,
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.720]  let's just put really big padding
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.580]  on the sides of the home screen.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.680]  And to just to compare and contrast, let's say,
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:09.700]  I know they don't make the 12 inch MacBook anymore,
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.140]  but the 12 inch MacBook is the smallest Mac screen
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.440]  in recent years.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.980]  When you're using that size MacBook,
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.180]  it doesn't feel like, well, this OS was really meant
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:29.180]  for a 30 inch Apple Pro display XDR or a 27 inch iMac.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:34.180]  And they've really sort of crammed it onto this thing
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.160]  or vice versa.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.280]  When you're using a 27 inch iMac,
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.240]  you don't feel like you're using an operating system
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.600]  and a home, a desktop and windows
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:49.200]  that were designed for a 12 inch laptop.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.800]  It scales and it feels like each one was designed for it.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.280]  The iPad mini, I do like this device.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.240]  I think people who like it will like it.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:02.240]  But it's very clear that iPad OS 15
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.300]  was not designed for this device.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.280]  And it should feel that way.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.200]  It should feel iPad, iPad OS 15 should feel just as,
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.600]  ah, everything is just the way it should be
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.840]  in just the right amount of things,
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.360]  right amount of icons in a row
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.360]  and the right size for widgets on a 13 inch, 12.9 inch,
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.680]  but I like to call it 13 inch iPad Pro as on the mini.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.840]  And that's just not true.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.400]  This feels like an OS and a home screen
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.520]  that was designed for 11 inch iPads and bigger.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.400]  Yeah, I have a theory,
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.640]  since we're talking about our wild theories.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.280]  I have a theory that Apple is moving toward
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:47.140]  a more complex windowing system for the iPad.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.000]  And they've been putting pieces in place,
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.400]  a lot more pieces in place in iOS 15
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.520]  with the new kind of windowing controls.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.640]  And they've got a floating window thing now,
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.140]  and they've got Quick Note,
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:00.000]  which they get very excited to talk about
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.840]  Quick Note on the iPad.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.720]  And then you use it on the Mac and you realize,
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.320]  oh, it's literally a floating window.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.960]  Like on the Mac, it's pointless because it's just a window
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.960]  like you can have on the Mac.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.600]  But on the iPad, a window from one app floating
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.400]  on top of other apps is mind blowing, right?
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.480]  And you can move it to whatever corner you want.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.520]  Oh, and you move it off the edge and then bring it back.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.560]  It is great on the iPad,
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.280]  but it also exposes just how limited the iPad's interface is.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.920]  So I have this feeling like with all the stuff they're doing,
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.440]  their shelf, the multi window,
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.440]  all this stuff that they're trying to get somewhere.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.560]  It feels like they're headed somewhere
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.160]  that is probably a more complex,
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.680]  at least optional windowing system of some kind.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.400]  And my theory is that that is connected to the fact
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.640]  that Apple at some point here is gonna probably do
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.520]  an external display that is not the Pro Display XDR.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.960]  And they've got Thunderbolt on the M1 iPad Pros.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.520]  And that at some point what they're gonna do
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.720]  is announce a display and you'll be able
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.560]  to connect an iPad to it.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.800]  And it will be able to be sort of more
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.600]  of a windowed kind of experience
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.000]  because on a big screen,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.440]  you can't just have a full screen app from an iPad.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.640]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.480]  And right now all you can do is sort of mirror an iPad
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.360]  display on an external monitor.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.240]  So that's my theory.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.120]  And one thing about like looking at the mini
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.040]  that I might be able to throw in there is
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.640]  maybe one of the reasons that some of these iPad things
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.840]  seem kind of stuck in the mud
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.440]  is because they wanna get to a place
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.400]  where the iPad interface scales better like the Mac
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.320]  and they have a plan to get there,
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.600]  but it's all kind of contingent on going
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.880]  to their new world and they're not there yet.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.440]  And I realized that there's certainly some wish casting
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.960]  in that theory on my part because I would love to see it.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.880]  But I don't know otherwise why Apple would keep trying
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:03.880]  to do floating windows and shelves with windows in them
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.760]  and remaking the menu bar when you hold down command keys,
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.800]  you get a full menu bar now that is essentially
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.200]  a Mac menu bar floating in front of you.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.560]  Like all the pieces are starting to form.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.760]  So I feel like that that's where they're going
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.520]  and knowing Apple, that's the kind of thing
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.480]  that they save for like a hardware announcement.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.480]  And if they ever did an external monitor
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.400]  that was more reasonably priced than the Pro Display XDR,
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.680]  that would be where I would say they'll drop it
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.760]  because they'll be like, boom, look what you can do now
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.240]  with an iPad and everybody will be amazed,
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.080]  sort of like what they did
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.480]  with the Magic Keyboard last year.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.280]  Yeah, my frustration, I love that they added,
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280]  I forget what they call it.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.640]  They don't call it a menu bar because there is no bar,
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.360]  but you know, there is a menuing system.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.600]  It's a floating menuing keyboard thing,
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.080]  but there is literally file edits, like it's all there.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.720]  The thing that kills me about it
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.400]  is if you don't have a keyboard connected,
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.520]  you can't get it.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.360]  I know.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.240]  Like it's crazy.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:04.240]  It's like, imagine if you got the Mac menu bar
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.680]  when you have a mouse connected,
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.640]  but if you're using a track pad instead of a mouse,
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.520]  it goes away.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.640]  It's like, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.040]  It's like, I think that's not the best analogy
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.320]  because a track pad and a mouse are sort of two ways
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.160]  to do the same thing,
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.120]  which is move a cursor around the screen and not have-
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.520]  But you should have,
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.640]  so Steven Trenton Smith, in one of his apps,
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.640]  he's got like a button
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.000]  that's like a command key symbol button
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.760]  and you tap on it and you get the menu,
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.680]  but it's like, that could be,
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.240]  Apple could make that a convention
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.440]  where there's something you tap that brings up the list
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.400]  because it's very helpful to have a list of every command
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.120]  like on the map that an app can do.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:42.960]  Right.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.800]  And they are spaced out in a way that makes them easy to tap.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.080]  So if there was some way of doing,
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.160]  like they've put this quick notes in the lower right corner,
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.560]  if maybe something in the lower left corner
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.920]  and then you could bring that up
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.640]  and then you could tap the menu.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.880]  It just seems crazy
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.640]  that they've added a really nice menuing system,
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.120]  very thoughtful, very, very thoughtful.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.720]  And you can only get it when you have a keyboard attached
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.320]  to a quote unquote touch first device.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.400]  I'm gonna go with,
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.160]  we haven't seen the end of the story yet
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.840]  and we're trying to make sense of the whole story
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840]  that we're only halfway through.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:21.680]  I sure hope so.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.040]  I mean, it feels like a big chunk of my job
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.400]  and your job is looking at what Apple does
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.000]  and then having these sort of two potential paths.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.800]  And the one is that I hope that they're planning something
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.280]  and they often are.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.400]  And sometimes they aren't.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.640]  And you're like, oh,
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.920]  I guess I was just trying to do some pattern matching there
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.120]  and I got all swept up in this grand plan
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.240]  that they don't actually have.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.960]  But I think that there's something going on with the iPad
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.680]  and whether that's an excuse
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.560]  for why things like the home screen being broken are,
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.560]  or if not broken uninspiring are,
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.680]  that may or may not be true,
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.440]  but I do think that they're doing something.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.720]  And like-
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.120]  Inefficiently, it certainly is inefficiently
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.960]  using the space, right?
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.960]  And which is crazy on the iPad that has the least space.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.920]  I know, I know.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.400]  It's kind of crazy that the iPad that has the least space,
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.760]  because it is the mini,
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.440]  uses the space that is available the least efficiently.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.080]  Yeah, with the iPad,
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.720]  I feel like it's always like the moment
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.600]  that Apple opens the door that makes you realize
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.720]  that they are gonna go through the doorway at some point.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.360]  So like, I used to get people arguing
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.760]  about file system access,
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.000]  saying, no, they're never gonna do a finder, it's an iPad.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.040]  And I would point them at that iCloud drive app
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.880]  that they released.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.080]  And I said, well, at this point, they've opened the door
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.000]  and now that became files
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.720]  and there is an iPad take on a file system, but it is there.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:54.520]  And that's how I feel about windowing
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.560]  is now that they've got the little floating mail window,
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.080]  is a message that floats above your mail app
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.720]  and you can take it and put it somewhere else.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.600]  And now that they've got quick note,
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.120]  they're basically admitting that having floating windows
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.000]  that you can move around on the screen
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.080]  is a thing that you can do on the iPad.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.320]  It's impossible for me to imagine
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.000]  that that isn't going somewhere,
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.120]  because why would you break that metaphor,
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.560]  but only one time?
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.200]  It doesn't really follow.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.800]  So they will do something with it sometime probably,
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.600]  but what it is, I don't know.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]  But you're right about,
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.000]  you're really right about those menus.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  They're really great,
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.040]  but because they came out of the keyboard shortcut overlay,
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.360]  they have not been integrated
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.320]  into the rest of the interface standards.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.360]  And it's a mistake.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:45.560]  If anything, they're actually in a way better than,
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.000]  or not better than the Mac,
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.920]  because the Mac's menus have to be that way
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.800]  because it's a mouse pointer driven system.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.800]  But in the Mac metaphor or any mouse pointer system,
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.880]  you have to go up there and click to drag it down
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.120]  and you can only see one at a time.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.080]  And you have to, it's a lot of work.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.080]  Whereas with the iPad system,
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.280]  you see them all at once
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.800]  and you can just sort of horizontally scroll over them
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.040]  and you can see multiple,
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.200]  if you forget whether like a certain command
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.320]  is in the view menu or the window menu,
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.400]  where do you go to turn that thing off?
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.840]  You can see them both at once and just tap at it.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.520]  You don't have to drag anything down to get to it.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.320]  You just stab your finger at it.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.280]  It actually could be more convenient to use
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.160]  than the Mac menuing system.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.960]  It's, the potential is huge.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.040]  It's a really nice design that you don't get
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.160]  if you don't have a keyboard.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.080]  Anyway, I'm gonna take a break here.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.840]  Thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.760]  Oh, guess what?
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.320]  Surprise, not a new sponsor.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.320]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.760]  Man, do I love Squarespace.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.320]  That is the place all in one place
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.960]  for non-technical people or technical people
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  to create, build, and run their own website.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.800]  You can go at the, just remember this code.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.280]  I'll tell you now, spoiler, remember the code, talk show.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.000]  Just plain old talk show.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.480]  When you check out, you get 10% off your order
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.560]  or you can tell your friends when they come to you,
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.920]  hey, how do I build a website?
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.720]  I need a website for blank.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.760]  Tell them to go to Squarespace, get them started.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.920]  They get a 30-day free trial, no watermarks.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.000]  They can do the whole thing.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.160]  It'll look real.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.880]  There's no, this is a demo version of Squarespace
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.960]  or anything like that.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.680]  Then 30 days are up.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.840]  They're ready to go.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.560]  They're like, I love it.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.280]  This is a great website.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.400]  Tell them the code, talk show.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.520]  They'll save 10%.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.760]  They can pay for up to a year in advance,
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:49.060]  save 10% on that whole year,
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.040]  and Squarespace will know they came from the show.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:53.880]  So just remember that.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.200]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200]  Next time you need a website
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.280]  or somebody you know needs a website,
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.320]  you can do everything, domain name, registration,
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.600]  analytics, CMS, where you can actually post,
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.060]  create a blog, put it on the site.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.960]  You post right through Squarespace.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.720]  My thanks to them for their continuing support of this show,
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.520]  squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.040]  All right, last but not least, it's sad.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.920]  It's this one.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.520]  This is the sad thing.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.340]  Uh-oh.
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:21.640]  Safari tabs.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640]  Ooh.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.480]  Ooh.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.960]  I'm, I, I'm, I was,
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.680]  I was actually a little shocked
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.960]  when Safari 15 shipped.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.760]  For, not for Monterey.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.920]  And I forgot that they do that, you know,
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.840]  that they've done that in past years,
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.360]  but there hasn't been anything controversial
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.640]  or shocking in the Mac version of Safari.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.400]  And so if the new version of Safari ships in September
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.160]  and the actual annual macOS update isn't coming
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.840]  until late October or even early November, so what?
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.240]  It's Safari and, you know, new Safari
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.040]  with new improvements to WebKit, it's all good.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.480]  But if you have automatic updates on,
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.460]  or you, even if you don't have automatic,
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:10.920]  if you just saw, oh, Safari 15's out, update.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.320]  And now you have Safari 15.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.160]  Now you got, you got different tabs.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.640]  I, I don't know what happened this summer.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.880]  Like they, obviously somebody was influential
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.720]  and got them to commit to this entire Safari redesign
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.520]  at WWDC.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.080]  And then they heard the feedback,
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.380]  which apparently got enough internal momentum at Apple
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:39.980]  to make changes, especially on the iPhone.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.280]  But there came a moment this summer.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.240]  I don't know if you noticed this.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.840]  I don't know if you were downloading all the betas.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.320]  I've, I've had a dedicated Mac for, for the betas
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.160]  and another Mac for the betas.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.600]  I have, but I have, but I was less on the Mac
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.100]  than the, than the iPad and iPhone.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.400]  So what happened is there was this moment
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.320]  where everything changed a little bit
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.120]  and they said, no, no, no, no, no, it's not all,
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.000]  it's, it's, it's going to change more.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.780]  And then they did another release on the iPhone.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.440]  They really started to shape up the iPhone.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.900]  And I felt at that moment, it's like, okay,
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.360]  the iPhone needed the most work.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.240]  They're doing work on the iPhone, that's good.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.700]  They got to come back to the iPad and the Mac.
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.760]  And they never came back to the iPad and the Mac.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:22.200]  And it feels to me like, and this may not be true.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.800]  I'm not trying to be unfair to them,
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.780]  but I'm just saying as an outside observer,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.960]  it feels to me like they shipped something
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.680]  that was unfinished.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.540]  And it's even worse than that.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.920]  It's like they had a vision for a new thing.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.900]  We're told that the new thing wasn't good.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.280]  And so they needed to start tearing it down,
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:44.320]  tared it or tore it part of the way down
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.960]  and then walked away.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.960]  And I don't see the point of what they did.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.040]  I don't see how changing the tabs to be less able
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:01.160]  to be scanned, they're harder to read.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.560]  The text in them is harder to read.
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.080]  It's harder to see which one of them is active.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.200]  The colored background, which you can turn off,
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.320]  but that makes it even harder because the contrast
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.920]  of the text and the color is changing from tab to tab,
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.620]  which makes it even harder to look at a screen and say,
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:17.800]  which is my active tab right now.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:23.520]  And they removed the metaphor of tabs.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.520]  So you used to be on the highlighting,
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.640]  you could literally see this tab goes down to the content.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.480]  Well, they removed that.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.160]  Now they're all little lozenges.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.800]  And they put the toolbar favorites, which I still use.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:39.780]  I do too.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:44.360]  Below the lozenges, which even further breaks the metaphor
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:47.200]  because they don't, content that doesn't change
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.560]  from tab to tab should never be below the tabs.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.680]  It seems obvious.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.720]  And I'm not telling tales out of school,
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.260]  but I did have a moment where I gave some feedback
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.920]  to somebody at Apple about Safari 15.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.920]  And one of the things I said was this,
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.160]  which is it doesn't make any sense for toolbar favorites
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:09.720]  to be below the tabs because the whole tab metaphor,
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.360]  it's the stuff that's below the tabs is the stuff
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360]  that changes and the stuff that's above doesn't change.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.080]  And they said, yes, yes, yes, of course, absolutely.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.160]  It never changed.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:17.980]  They never fixed it.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:19.180]  It's not like that on the Mac.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.780]  It's not like that on the iPad.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:24.400]  They just sort of have kept this kind of halfway.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:26.240]  And you know what?
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.640]  The color thing is, it's cute.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.080]  I updated six colors.
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.320]  So it matches the color in the menu bar when you go there.
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.160]  It's cute.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.080]  You could turn it off, that's fine.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.280]  But like decreasing the legibility of tabs,
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.160]  like they put so much effort into tab groups,
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.520]  which is this really nice feature that acknowledges
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.800]  how important tabs are to people.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.160]  And yet at the same time,
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.080]  they completely destroyed tab legibility.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.720]  I don't understand how an organization that understands
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.160]  how people use tabs would at the same moment
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.440]  that they launched their feature that makes tabs better,
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.080]  make tabs unreadable.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:09.160]  But that's what, I mean, at least it doesn't ship
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.140]  with the compact view, which made them even more unreadable.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.320]  But they're still not very readable,
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:17.440]  even in the non-compact view.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.160]  There is, so iPhone has already always called
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.160]  multiple browser instances within Safari tabs,
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:32.760]  even though they almost never actually look like
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.320]  actual tab tabs.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.520]  Although when you hold your phone horizontally,
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.800]  you can get it to look like tabs.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.600]  And I think that that's still an option in iOS 15.
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.960]  But almost, who uses their phone horizontally
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.100]  to read Safari other than to watch videos?
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.200]  And I'm okay with that because people get it.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.200]  Tabs is what, people kind of get that tabs in browser
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.960]  means two different things.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.160]  It means multiple web pages open at once.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.160]  And it also means a visual UI element that is a metaphorical
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.040]  tab from like file folder tabs,
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.360]  that look like actual tabs.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.200]  It means both, and they're sort of a one-to-one relationship
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.400]  in the way that, and everybody, I think just,
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.560]  even if you are a normal person who doesn't think deeply
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.520]  about user interfaces of the things you're using,
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.000]  you get it that the iPhone is too small to have tab tabs.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  But in a windowing system, like the Mac or Windows,
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.920]  or any other system where you have what we consider
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.520]  a traditional GUI of windows that you can drag around,
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.340]  the actual tab metaphor is important.
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.760]  It is really important.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.760]  And the thing with the favorites bar going under the tabs,
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.920]  it could go under in the,
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.800]  I actually dug up the old article I wrote.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.160]  Remember when Safari had a beta with tabs on top?
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.360]  That could work.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.080]  And I was like, I think that's what I wrote.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.720]  And I went back and read my article.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.880]  I had a really good article.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.020]  I have to say, I almost never praised myself,
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:20.580]  but I was like, younger John Gruber who wrote this article
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:25.200]  really did a good job and made an, broke, not tradition.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.160]  I don't have a rule against including images,
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.080]  but people who listen to the show know
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.920]  I don't put a lot of images in my articles usually,
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.120]  but I, by my standards, copiously illustrated that
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.180]  with the actual Safari tabs
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:41.360]  that the Safari beta was proposing.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.040]  And some, hmm, here are some mock-ups
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.600]  from other people around the web
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.380]  suggesting better ways to do it.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.420]  And the problem with the Safari tabs from,
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.760]  I forget what year it was, but it was, you know.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.720]  2009.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.960]  2009, was that they went all the way
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  to the top of the window and left no room
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.640]  for a place to grab to drag the window around,
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.360]  which is a thing you might wanna do.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.400]  And the ideas that I mocked, you know, people mocked up
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.280]  were just move them down a little bit
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.560]  and leave a little bit of a strip up there
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.640]  of just window area so you can grab the window,
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.720]  move the window, and then the tabs are underneath.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.720]  But tabs on top at least still establishes a hierarchy
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.700]  where the hierarchy is there's a selected tab
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.820]  and then underneath the tab is all of the browser chrome,
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:35.140]  like the address bar and the back button
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.120]  and the reload button and extensions,
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.720]  and then your favorites bar, and then a line,
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.800]  and then the web content, right?
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.300]  That works too.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:49.540]  What doesn't work, so it's not that you can't put anything
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.420]  under the tabs, but the problem is the tabs have to be
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.700]  at the top or they have to be at the bottom, right?
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:58.660]  They need to be, the metaphor is that the tab
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:02.580]  is enclosing something, and it can be enclosing
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.900]  the entire browser window or they can be enclosing
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.660]  the content space.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:12.660]  But it is maddening, and like if you open two tabs
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:18.340]  in Safari 15 on the Mac, just two tabs in a window,
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:21.180]  and I think it's worse in dark mode,
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:25.420]  but it is bad in both dark mode and light mode to,
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.780]  and especially if you-
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:29.380]  And depends on if you've got the color option turned on,
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.940]  it literally depends on which site is currently
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:35.100]  the active tab, because the coloring completely changes.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.540]  But if you, let's say, and to me this is a common scenario,
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:41.900]  to open two tabs for the same website, right?
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:43.940]  Like maybe you're at the New York Times
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.860]  and you're reading two different articles today
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:48.960]  at the New York Times, or you're at a shopping site
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.660]  and you're comparing two products from the same company,
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:56.660]  and so like the fav icons are the same, and it...
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.900]  I dare you to tell at a glance which tab is active
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:05.540]  in Safari 15, because is it the one that has more contrast
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:09.500]  and it's lighter, or is it the one that has less contrast
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:10.480]  and it's darker?
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.740]  You have to think about it.
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.420]  And I know there are people, I hear about them,
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.740]  I hear from them on Twitter as I gripe about Safari
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:20.180]  and they're calling me old and they're like, you know,
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.900]  get with the times and things change.
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:26.660]  And it's people, you might like it, there are people,
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:29.500]  clearly some people at Apple clearly like it, right?
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.260]  I mean, there's somebody at Apple likes it
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:32.500]  because they shipped it.
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:38.260]  It is to me catastrophic to replace a visual metaphor
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:40.280]  that nobody ever had to think about.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.680]  Nobody ever had to think which tab is active,
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:47.260]  whether you have one tab or two tabs, three tabs,
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:51.020]  20 tabs in a window, at a glance,
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:54.100]  anybody could tell which one is the active tab
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.340]  because there's no difference in contrast
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:58.540]  because it's connected to the Chrome.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:02.960]  Now, it's this total guessing game where you have to think
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.700]  about a thing that you never had to think about.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:09.300]  And Don Norman, user interface, human interface guru,
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.740]  even wrote a book called Don't Make Me Think.
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:16.740]  Like that's actually a great adage, you know,
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:19.260]  and like Don Norman has talked a lot about like doors
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:21.740]  and like any door you've ever approached
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:23.460]  where you've like pushed instead of pulled
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.820]  or pulled instead of pushed and it was the wrong way
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.340]  is a failure of door design.
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.900]  It's an absolute failure.
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.420]  That was, that's actually Steve Krug wrote that book
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:34.740]  because I assigned, that was when I taught web design
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:36.260]  at UC Berkeley.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:38.680]  Thank you for saving me again, Jason.
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:42.180]  Early 2000s, we assigned that book because it is so good.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.880]  And yes, the problem with the two options,
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.180]  both of which is slightly different,
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:49.580]  but neither of which indicates which one is selected
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.740]  is a classic user interface problem, right?
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:55.220]  And how does Safari 14 and all previous versions
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.980]  of Safari deal with that?
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:01.500]  And the answer is only one tab has no barrier between it
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.060]  and the rest of the browser Chrome.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.500]  It's the one that's selected.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:05.660]  It has no ceiling.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:06.940]  It's not walled off.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.740]  And so, you know, it must be active.
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:10.940]  And they took it away.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:13.140]  And again, if I ask why they took it away, John,
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:16.340]  I think the answer is they didn't, it was part
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:17.660]  of a larger strategy.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.080]  They had the strategy that they wanted to reduce the size
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.260]  of the browser Chrome so that content could be free
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:29.020]  and fill the space, which while an admirable goal
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:34.020]  makes less sense if you've got a Mac with a 27 inch screen
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:38.060]  or even a Mac or an iPad with a 13 inch screen
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.860]  than it does if you're on an iPhone.
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.860]  And when they realized there was pushback
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:44.180]  for their super compact interface,
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:48.660]  they unraveled that but left all the pieces.
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:52.300]  And so we're left with a design that sort of comes out
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:55.860]  of the idea of having an incredibly compact bar.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:58.140]  The compact bar is off by default,
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:01.100]  but we're left with all of the pieces of the compact bar
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:05.500]  that have all of the problems that kill legibility in tabs.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:08.440]  So I just, I don't, I can't believe they shipped it.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:09.280]  I gotta say it.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.420]  I can't believe they shipped it.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:11.540]  I can't believe they didn't do,
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.980]  look, they didn't ship share play.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.900]  They didn't ship universal control.
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.480]  There are all these things that they didn't ship
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.860]  because they are not ready yet.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.820]  And yet somehow broken user interface
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:24.660]  is not broken enough not to ship it.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.420]  I don't understand why they shipped it
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.740]  because could it be better?
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:30.980]  They could tweak it and make it better and make it usable.
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:34.680]  But what it is now is not that and yet they shipped it.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.580]  I don't get it.
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.500]  I don't understand why they didn't say
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.100]  let's hold off on this a little bit.
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.620]  I have talked to friends at Apple, people who work at Apple
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.780]  in software, it had nothing to do with this.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:47.460]  They're just using the betas and friends, multiple friends
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:48.780]  who've said more or less the same thing,
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:53.020]  which is I work at Apple, I'm confused
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:55.100]  which tab is active in my browser.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.060]  I cannot believe, and they cannot believe
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:00.380]  that this is the state of Safari's user interface design.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.340]  And the part that makes it so heartbreaking
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.680]  is that Safari invented tabs on Mac.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.260]  When Safari first added tabs,
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:10.260]  tabs were not a thing on the Mac.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.940]  And the Safari implementation of tabs was so good
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:16.100]  that when the Finder added tabs,
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:20.420]  when they added tabs to the NS document
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:23.500]  and all NS document based, like say you want to,
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:26.620]  you could make a keynote tab, text edit,
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:28.580]  you can make those tab terminal.
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:31.900]  People love, people who use terminal love tabs and terminal.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:32.860]  They're all Safari tabs.
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:34.380]  They're all Safari tabs.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.400]  It became the Safari implementation of tabs
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.940]  became the Mac implementation of tabs.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.100]  And they just flushed it down the toilet for something.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.220]  And this is what I don't understand is why, why?
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:49.220]  Like again, who decided that they needed,
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.420]  they so desperately needed to eke out a line
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:57.580]  of vertical space in a browser window on all the platforms
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.080]  that they needed to completely rethink it.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.060]  Like that's the part that gets me is what I want to say is,
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.360]  look, they didn't do it.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.420]  They took their best shot.
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:07.580]  It's kind of broken,
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:10.220]  but at least they tried to solve this nagging problem,
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.740]  but there's no nagging problem.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:15.020]  There's no nagging problem to be solved.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.300]  It comes across more like either they were just kind of
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.860]  bored and wanted to do something different,
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.460]  or there was a problem on the iPhone
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:23.660]  that they wanted to solve.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.980]  And because Apple strategically now wants
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:28.500]  to roll everything out across all their platforms,
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:31.560]  rather than really rethink what they were doing,
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.820]  they kind of took too many principles from the iPhone
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:37.260]  and rolled this project out across.
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:40.020]  Because like, again, I would be much more sympathetic
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:42.460]  if they were solving a problem that actually existed,
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:43.900]  but it was fine.
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:45.260]  I think it looks like,
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:50.260]  I think it looks like a design from a high budget movie
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.140]  or like sci-fi TV show where they want to make
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:59.140]  a computer interface without showing a real,
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:02.280]  you know, for product placement purposes,
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.740]  don't want to show Microsoft windows,
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:05.360]  don't want to show Macs.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.200]  And so-
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.820]  Yeah, they make a fake computer interface.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:10.540]  Right, like, you know, or like the Marvel-
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:13.300]  It's like that Batman movie where Batman has the keyboard
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.540]  with the space bar on the top.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:15.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.860]  It's that kind of thing where it's like,
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.940]  it's fake, but it's okay.
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:20.420]  Cause there's also a man in a bat costume, it's fine.
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:22.220]  And it's an art form, right?
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.800]  Like to make like the Tony Stark interfaces
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.820]  for his devices that are not based on anything.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:28.980]  It looks like that type of interface.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.940]  It looks cool and it does not work well.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:34.380]  And I know we all- You know it would be unusable,
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.860]  but it doesn't matter cause it looks cool.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:37.620]  It looks cool and that's all there is.
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:41.020]  And I know that I throw it out a lot
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.660]  and other people use it a lot and it's,
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:45.140]  but it's not overused.
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:49.380]  We quote Steve Jobs on this because it is such a key,
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:52.460]  keen observation and it's so important
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:56.620]  that people think design is just how it looks,
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.320]  but it's not, design is how it works.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:00.660]  And it doesn't-
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:01.760]  And it gets misunderstood, right?
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.820]  Because look is, can be a part of the working
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:06.340]  and it can be aesthetically pleasing,
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:09.980]  but if it looks good and doesn't work, it's not good design.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.900]  It's almost like that part.
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:14.660]  It was, that's from an interview with the New York Times.
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:18.880]  I forget what year, probably like 2004 or so.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:23.220]  But the part that Steve Jobs didn't even see fit to say
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:25.420]  is that of course our stuff looks beautiful.
[01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:27.340]  You know, cause that's the thing that they're known for.
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:31.300]  It went unsaid that their stuff looks really cool.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:33.380]  The hardware and the software.
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.980]  But what he was trying to say is that's not the game
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:39.000]  we play though, just to make it look beautiful.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  It's how it works.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.060]  It just went unsaid that it looks beautiful.
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:47.060]  Nobody looked at Safari 14 or Safari one, two, three,
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:50.300]  blah, dot, dot, dot through 14 and said,
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.620]  well, that's an ugly looking web browser.
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:54.980]  Boy, those tabs are frigging ugly.
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:56.180]  Can't stand them.
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.500]  They're so gross.
[01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.620]  It's, and the people who seem to love this,
[02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:03.140]  all they, and their only defense of it
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.940]  is that they think it looks cool.
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:08.340]  And that's, you know, and there are people, you know,
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:10.700]  and I used to, we all did, you know,
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:13.940]  like when I was younger and loved playing with the
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:18.780]  kaleidoscope and Aaron back in the classic days right there
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:21.540]  and tweaked out, customized all my icons.
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:24.220]  And I'd have all sorts of custom themes on my Mac.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:26.980]  But I knew that I was horsing around too, you know,
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:31.940]  and it's, and even when I was custom theming my,
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.900]  my Mac OS seven or Mac OS eight machines,
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.080]  it wasn't breaking the usability of it.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:37.920]  I wasn't,
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.300]  I wasn't installing themes that made it so I couldn't tell
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.420]  which window was active.
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.060]  You know?
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:45.420]  And I will say this though.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.500]  I feel like we dodged a bullet in the sense that they
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:50.300]  shipped with the compact mode off.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:53.500]  It's still there and you can turn it on, but it ships off.
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:54.700]  Why it shipped at all.
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.660]  I, again, I don't understand.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:58.900]  And somebody thinks that it's great and they wanted to ship
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:03.300]  it like the, everything gets compacted more,
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:06.100]  lots of buttons in the browser toolbar vanish.
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.060]  And this happens on the iPad as well as on the Mac,
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:11.540]  the tabs that are not the currently active tab you do see,
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:15.180]  this is an effect of them ripping the stuff out is the tab
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.780]  that's currently active is much wider because it's the URL
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:19.620]  bar.
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:22.820]  And that is a clue about what your current selected tab is.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:24.840]  The problem is one,
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.340]  all the other tabs are so small that even if you only have
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.500]  three tabs open,
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:31.520]  you basically can't read the contents of any tab,
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.360]  which is bad for tab navigation.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:36.220]  Cause you really want to see what's in all of your tabs and
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:38.180]  two, the currently active page,
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:41.540]  you can't see what it's called because it's a URL bar up
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:43.620]  there instead of the name of the tab that you're on,
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.380]  which I think is also a mistake.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:49.460]  So like that, that really made me scratch my head of like,
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:52.140]  do they understand how people use web browsers?
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.620]  Because you know,
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.300]  and do they know that they're building a feature called tab
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:58.940]  groups? That's all about celebrating the use of tabs.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.320]  And yet they've built a user interface that makes tabs
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.960]  illegible, but at least that is turned off,
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:07.700]  although still it's still there. They just turned it off.
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:09.180]  I don't get it.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:12.020]  Pushes them off to the side where you can't even see them
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:15.220]  with no affordance to indicate how many of them are scrolled
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.460]  off to the side.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:20.100]  Oh, don't forget that on the iPad, especially if they get
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.140]  really small,
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:26.140]  the, you basically to tap them is to close them.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:29.280]  So they get beyond a certain point and you can't really
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.000]  activate them because they're the tap target,
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  because the, I think this is another user,
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:34.900]  I'm talking about minor,
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:38.520]  but another user interface problem is that the fat,
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:42.360]  the fade icon becomes the close box,
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:44.840]  which I think is a huge mistake, right?
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:47.680]  Because I just don't think like your congratulations,
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.760]  your logo is now a close box. I don't,
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:53.440]  I don't like it. And on the safari previous safari,
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:57.280]  the, the X goes off on the, on the left side.
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.840]  And that's where you close it.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.960]  But now it's just like hovering under the fat icon.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  It's for you to, for you to get it's kind of bananas
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.120]  because you'd think the fab icon might serve as a proxy for
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.800]  the URL. And in fact, like the document icon,
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.360]  when you have a document in the finder or when you open it
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.400]  and it's in the window and you see the, the proxy icon,
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.080]  although it last year, they took it, you know,
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.980]  they hit it by default so that it only shows up on hover.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.760]  Clearly this is the work of the same team.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.080]  And let's face it, you know,
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:34.360]  I'm not trying to throw Alan Dye personally under the bus,
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.560]  but he is in charge of human interface design.
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:37.800]  He's ultimately responsible.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.880]  And he does come from a graphic design background,
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:43.240]  not a interface design background.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.240]  I have no idea if he personally, you know,
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.140]  has had any opinion about any of this,
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:48.960]  but he is ultimately responsible.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:53.140]  But I, when you do get the proxy icon and you have to hover
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.800]  to get it now, you can click on it to drag it,
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.320]  to like drag it into a messages window,
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:02.240]  to send somebody a copy of it or drag it into a mail message
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.560]  to do it. And so you might think, oh,
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:07.880]  I could drag the fab icon to drag this URL and guess what?
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.880]  It closes the window or closes the tab.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.120]  That is a very bizarre conflation of,
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:19.320]  of the most destructive action with the,
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.100]  I want to keep this thing and do something with it intent.
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:26.040]  I think, I think there's a lot of pride showing here where
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.080]  rather than just pull this out and say,
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:29.760]  we'll come back with a new version later,
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.120]  they tried to fix it in progress.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.280]  And then they just shipped whatever they had at the moment
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.400]  when they needed to ship it.
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.400]  When the wise thing to do would probably have been to say,
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:37.800]  we'll be back, you know,
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.900]  we're not going to ship this right away,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.000]  like universal control.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.520]  Like you said, they've done with so many other things
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.040]  and they've been doing to their credit.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.040]  I think one of the best changes at Apple in the last,
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:54.500]  maybe four years or so, fourish,
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:58.840]  is to switch from trying to get as many features
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:03.840]  into the.o fall upgrade of the OS and instead treat WWDC
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  as a roadmap for the year to come and do more 14.2,
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  14.3, 14, we're up to like 14.6 in iOS
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:17.360]  or something like that.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.360]  And to do and roll out major features like the iPad,
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.940]  track pad and mouse pointer support in March,
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:29.280]  rather than, you know, have everything all come out at once.
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.640]  Roll these features out when they're ready.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.780]  This tab design is not ready.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:39.780]  And to me, it's risky for Apple.
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.160]  It's not just, hey, people like me and you are annoyed
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.720]  and they're hearing it
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:51.000]  from the user interface critic people.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.560]  Safari is in a very competitive
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:58.400]  and precarious state on the Mac,
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.800]  because on the Mac, you can just,
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.080]  you're two clicks away from installing Chrome
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:06.160]  or Brave or Firefox or something like that.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.880]  And I'm not trying to be snarky here.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:14.560]  I can actually foresee Google, like you go to Google
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:17.240]  and they tell you sometimes if you're using Safari,
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:18.580]  you can download Chrome.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.240]  I could see them doing it and say, download Chrome,
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.360]  the Mac browser with tabs that look like tabs
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:28.700]  and show a little screenshot of Chrome's tabs
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:30.600]  that look like tabs.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:33.680]  You know, talk about a glass of ice water and hell, right?
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.740]  It's like, so people who like get this surprise update,
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.280]  what the hell happened to my Safari?
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.820]  You get the color backgrounds by default
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:45.440]  and you have to go into preferences to turn it off.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:49.520]  And everybody knows that the more non-nerdy
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:53.680]  and just typical Joe and Jane user you might be,
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:57.880]  the less likely you ever are to go into preferences.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.160]  So people are gonna, you know,
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.920]  lots of people who don't like the color background,
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.700]  the color tint, whatever you call it,
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:06.700]  and would like it if it were turned off,
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:08.680]  but don't know they can turn it off
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:10.800]  and won't go hunting to turn it off,
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.640]  will be using it in that mode.
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:15.680]  And you can, you know, Google can just show them,
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:17.040]  hey, take a look at Chrome.
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:22.040]  Looks like a normal Mac window with normal Mac tabs,
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:24.880]  although they have the close buttons on the wrong side.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.840]  Yeah, just like Safari on the iPhone, by the way.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.720]  That's the worst thing about Safari on the iPhone.
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:30.880]  I don't get it.
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.840]  Why did they do it?
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.160]  Why do they have the close buttons in the top right,
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:35.040]  like windows?
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.160]  It's a sign of...
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:42.200]  I don't know, something's going on there.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.040]  Something's going on.
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:44.080]  Something bad is happening.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:45.680]  That's the part that concerns me the most about it.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.100]  I mean, we can rail about this,
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:51.040]  but I'm more concerned about the fact that this happened
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:55.080]  and that while I am encouraged by the fact that it happened
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.920]  and yet somehow the outcry and the feedback was enough
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:02.040]  that they listened to a lot of the criticism of it
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:04.020]  and actually changed some of it,
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:06.560]  which they say is what the beta process is for,
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:08.400]  but it isn't always true.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:09.840]  And I appreciate that.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:13.320]  Yet I am also extremely worried, one,
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.100]  that somehow this got in the keynote without,
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.760]  it's not without anybody criticizing it.
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.600]  It's without anybody criticizing it to the point
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.440]  that made it clear that they needed to put the brakes on it.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.360]  And that two, as the summer went along,
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.000]  that whatever they had,
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.600]  they felt was shippable when it's really bad.
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:35.320]  And this all could have been avoided.
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:36.560]  This all could have been avoided
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.280]  and they could have saved face by saying,
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.860]  look, we've got your feedback.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:41.360]  It's very important to us.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.440]  We're not gonna ship the new version of Safari right away.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.800]  We will come back with changes and you're gonna love it.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.280]  But instead they just sort of made a few changes
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:50.520]  in the summer and shipped it.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.840]  And why that was allowed to happen,
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.960]  that's what worries me.
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.560]  Right, we wasted all of our bullets
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:00.560]  fixing, getting iOS Safari fixed.
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.380]  And iOS Safari as it appeared in beta one was way worse.
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:07.080]  I mean, it was catastrophically bad.
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:07.960]  The worst.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:12.320]  And indeed they fixed it.
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.400]  I still, I really questioned
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.600]  whether they should have the address bar on the bottom.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:21.280]  That was the first of my wife when she upgraded.
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.280]  It was like, what the hell is this?
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.720]  And she never comes to me and complains
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:27.480]  about things like that, like interface changes.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:32.480]  She, but like two minutes into using iOS 15 on iPhone,
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:34.040]  she was on a webpage and she was like,
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:34.880]  what the hell is this?
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:36.240]  And I said, oh, you can, here,
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:39.720]  go to the AA menu address bar on top.
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:40.760]  And she was like, okay, thank you.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.360]  And then she hasn't been back to me since.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.520]  But I still think it was a bad default.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.280]  And I know some people like it,
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.360]  but to me they should not have changed that
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:51.760]  because I'm telling you it's a big change
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.760]  for people who don't like big change to,
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.200]  I think it's great as an option,
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.760]  but I just don't think it should be the default.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.040]  But overall, iOS Safari, let's call it fixed.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:01.920]  It's a good update.
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.080]  It looks good.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.700]  The tab close buttons are in the wrong corner.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:07.960]  I think that the address bar
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.320]  probably should still be at the top by default,
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:12.680]  but I can hear the argument otherwise.
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:14.800]  Mac Safari tabs, disaster.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:18.080]  This is one of the worst things Apple has ever shipped.
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:19.420]  Yeah, I can't disagree.
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:22.160]  And I'm telling you, I don't have analytics
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.720]  on Daring Fireball at the moment
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:25.720]  because I got rid of Google Analytics last year
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:26.840]  for privacy reasons.
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.040]  And I'm looking at some privacy respecting packages.
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.300]  So I don't know my exact numbers.
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.200]  And I don't think my audience is quite
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:39.600]  representative of anything as a whole.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:43.280]  But I would not be surprised that among websites
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.640]  that have representative audiences of the general public,
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:52.640]  Safari for Mac is going to see a significant decrease
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.360]  in users because of this.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.680]  Because this is the thing.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.640]  Nerds might argue about the difference
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:03.680]  in support for progressive web apps
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:06.760]  and aggressive support of the latest and greatest standards
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:07.580]  and stuff like that.
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.480]  But you know what normal people care about?
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.940]  Do I understand what tab is active?
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:12.880]  Does this look right?
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.940]  Does this look like a normal web browser?
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:16.480]  Yep.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.800]  And that's a real shame because you know
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:19.480]  it's not the WebKit people who chose this.
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.320]  This is some kind of human interface thing.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:24.240]  And so all of this hard work that they put into WebKit,
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.280]  and Safari is the only major WebKit browser.
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.680]  No offense to like, iCab,
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:32.520]  and I know there's a few other browsers that are esoteric.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.920]  But if you want a mainstream browser
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.400]  that uses WebKit on your Mac, your choice is Safari.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.560]  And the reason that Safari is the only one
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.880]  is that Safari has been so good as a Mac app.
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:46.080]  Yeah, and I just don't want to get,
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:50.040]  like also the Safari team built tab groups.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.880]  And I think tab groups are pretty great.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.360]  It's a new feature and they auto sync across
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:56.200]  and you can throw your tabs in there
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.400]  and it's really easy to throw things into groups
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.880]  and then they live on all your devices
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:01.520]  and like it's such a great tab feature.
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:04.120]  And yet, again, it's in this release
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:05.920]  that's so broken in so many other ways
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:08.640]  and sadly makes tabs worse.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:11.600]  Like why did that have to happen at the same time?
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:14.480]  Why did that have to happen at the same time?
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  It's a shame because that's a great feature.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.040]  Yeah, anyway.
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:19.440]  Well, enough ranting.
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:22.160]  Jason, thank you as always for joining.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:24.520]  I will thank our sponsors.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:28.520]  We had Squarespace where you can go to build a website.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:31.400]  We had Earnest where you can refinance
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.880]  your student loans at a great rate.
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.440]  And Sanity.io.the talk show.
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:39.200]  Also news from you before we go,
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.520]  you've got a new podcast coming.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:43.080]  Now, this is what I've been telling you for years, Jason.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.840]  What you need is to do more podcasts.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.120]  More podcasts in my life, yeah, I know.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.760]  There's so many, but this is really taking the place
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:52.680]  of a podcast that we stopped last year
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.400]  called the TV Talk Machine that I used to do
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:57.320]  with Tim Goodman, who was the chief TV critic
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:58.280]  at The Hollywood Reporter.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.400]  And Tim retired from TV criticism to become a TV writer.
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.920]  He got a development deal, great for him.
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:07.360]  I hope one of his shows gets picked up someday.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:08.720]  That would be really awesome.
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.600]  But we used to talk more than his reviews of TV shows.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.360]  We ended up spending lots of time talking
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.040]  about the streaming wars and peak TV
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.800]  and Amazon and Apple and Netflix
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.440]  getting into the business and Disney and Warner countering
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.840]  and what the future of TV was gonna be linear
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:28.640]  versus streaming and all of this stuff.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.480]  Like, I think it's really fascinating.
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.960]  It's changing really fast.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.840]  Everybody wants to be one of the big companies
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:38.520]  that's left at the end because a bunch of them
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.080]  are gonna lose, but the ones who win
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.680]  are they're gonna be kings.
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:44.240]  And I love talking to Tim about that.
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:47.720]  I got the impression that his editors at THR
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.480]  just wanted him to review lots of shows.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:51.600]  And he was much more interested in talking about
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.880]  the future of TV than he was about this crappy sitcom.
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.600]  And so when that show ended,
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:01.880]  I have had a TV Talk Machine sized hole in my life.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:04.480]  And we talk about some of that stuff on upgrade,
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:06.960]  but it's usually pretty Apple TV focused.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.240]  Occasionally we spread out.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:11.440]  And in August, I did a guest episode with Julie Alexander,
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:13.200]  who used to cover this stuff for The Verge
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:14.720]  and Polygon and IGN.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.120]  And now her job is literally to be an analyst
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:21.040]  in this space for Parrot Research.
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.240]  So they do research on like demand for various shows
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:27.680]  and various streaming services and lots of great stuff.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.120]  And I always thought she was really great.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:30.880]  She was a great guest on upgrade.
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:34.040]  And at that point, basically we started talking about,
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:35.320]  could we do this as a podcast?
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.880]  So it's called Downstream.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.640]  It starts October 6th, we have a zero episode.
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:42.320]  That's like a sample episode we recorded last month
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.320]  and an intro just to kind of get it into Apple Podcasts
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.720]  and stuff, but the real stuff starts October 6th.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:50.600]  So if you're interested in sort of the future
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.480]  of the business of binging and other stuff like that,
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:57.120]  we're gonna do every other week,
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:58.800]  me and Julie Alexander talking about it.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.840]  So it is a new podcast for me,
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.800]  but I feel like I was holding open that spot
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:05.200]  when TVTM shut down,
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.680]  hoping that I would be able to put something else in there
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:08.840]  and this is what we're gonna do.
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:10.000]  All right, you call it right now,
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.360]  is Apple gonna get the NFL Sunday ticket?
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:18.120]  I think they are, unless Amazon kind of out bids them.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.800]  And the reason for that is I think we've seen Apple,
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:25.160]  Apple's really interested in live
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.360]  and a lot of its competitors aren't.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.920]  Like Disney's interested in live and that's ESPN.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.760]  So maybe Amazon's interested in live
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:36.680]  and they actually have an NFL package next year
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.400]  that they're gonna start doing.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.080]  Netflix is not interested in live things
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:42.880]  as far as I can tell.
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:44.720]  And live has its own, like live streaming,
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.760]  you've gotta hit a peak demand.
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:48.480]  You can't just put it on your CDN.
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.920]  You've gotta actually serve it
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:53.000]  and your servers have to survive.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.640]  And I think Apple sees live sports as the future.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.360]  Sunday ticket seems to be one of the things
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:01.200]  that would get them on the map in terms of live sports.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:05.840]  So I think they're maybe the favorite for it at this point
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:08.560]  from what I've seen, maybe not over a 50% chance,
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.760]  but I think maybe they're the favorite
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:13.120]  because they wanna make their mark in live events
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:14.400]  and they haven't gotten there
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.360]  other than their own product events,
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:17.440]  they haven't gotten there.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.360]  And so I think Apple is gonna do a sports play of some kind
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:22.080]  and Sunday ticket is a pretty good one
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.320]  because for those who don't know,
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.040]  that's like every NFL game that's out of market
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:29.480]  and you can just watch them all.
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:31.640]  You can pick your favorite team from out of market
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.040]  and watch their game.
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.320]  That has some interesting kind of interface possibilities
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.840]  to it that I think Apple would really get into.
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.040]  It's been exclusive to DirecTV, maybe from the get-go.
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:46.120]  And DirecTV is now owned by AT&T
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:48.400]  and they spend $3 billion a year
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.160]  or something like that on the NFL Sunday ticket
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:51.800]  and make a billion from it,
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.120]  but supposedly make it up
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:54.840]  by getting people to sign up for DirecTV.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.680]  And AT&T at this point is like, we don't care.
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:58.520]  We don't care about DirecTV.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:03.520]  Whoever pays for Sunday ticket is overpaying
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.400]  because they have the strategy reason
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.320]  why they wanna get people on their platform.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.920]  And Apple, I mean, Apple is absolutely one of those people
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.640]  to say, we are gonna overpay
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:16.040]  because we want people to, we want their credit card
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.760]  and we want them to sign up for Apple TV Plus or Sports Plus
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.440]  or whatever they wanna do next.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.640]  That's the reason you'd pay for something like Sunday ticket
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:24.640]  because you will overpay.
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.960]  You'll never make the money back,
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:28.360]  but you'll get people in your system.
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.840]  One of the big customers for this
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:31.800]  or it's like a sports bar type place
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.560]  that wants to have all the games
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:36.280]  so that no matter which game you wanna see,
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:37.960]  you can go to that bar
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:40.760]  and watch the game that you want to see.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:45.120]  And I know that the Apple TV strategy
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:48.200]  isn't really about selling TV hardware, Apple TV hardware,
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.840]  but that's a use case
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:52.160]  where they might sell a lot of Apple TVs, right?
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:54.480]  Like where the best way to run a sports bar
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.320]  where you show every single Sunday game
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.640]  is to just buy like three Apple TVs and hook them up to TVs.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:01.760]  And like you said, it's an interface challenge.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.520]  And that's the type of thing
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:05.080]  Apple could make really, really nice
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.600]  where it's really, really a good interface
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.440]  for the people who run the establishment to be like,
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.160]  okay, we'll put the Kansas City game over there.
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.480]  We'll put the 49ers over there
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.160]  and we'll put the Dallas game on that TV over there.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.040]  And we better put a second version
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:20.080]  of the Dallas game over here
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.600]  because there's lots of Dallas fans.
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:24.240]  Plus it allows them to potentially innovate
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.920]  and like drop the radio broadcasts on
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:27.400]  so you could listen to the radio broadcast
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.240]  instead of the TV.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.440]  There's all sorts of stuff you can do
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:30.840]  once you've got those things on streaming
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:33.320]  instead of just on sort of more linear satellite.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.680]  I did see a story the other day from a guy who runs a bar
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:38.160]  who said, oh, I hope it doesn't go to streaming
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:40.240]  because my internet isn't fast enough
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:43.400]  to stream seven different games at once, which I get,
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:46.680]  but I also think, dude, you're a cheapskate,
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.520]  upgrade your internet.
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  And DirecTV is not that great a stream.
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:55.280]  And also I would say I think some of those bars
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.400]  are gonna lose customers
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:59.960]  because to install a satellite dish on your roof
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:04.960]  just to get DirecTV, it's a big, big threshold to cross.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:08.920]  Whereas just clicking a button on a streamer box,
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:10.560]  whether it's Apple or somebody else and say,
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.120]  yes, give this to me and not have to install hardware
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.720]  just to get it, it's gonna be a much more successful package
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:18.640]  than it was before.
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.800]  Because that was the whole idea is like,
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.080]  I got DirecTV for NFL Sunday ticket.
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:24.920]  In fact, when I bought my house, I was like,
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:26.760]  okay, I guess we're getting satellite TV
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:28.600]  because I want that package.
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:32.680]  And it's a lot to put a box in your house
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.320]  and a giant dish on your roof
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.360]  and it tied to your chimney and stuff like that.
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:37.760]  And this is gonna be way easier.
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.080]  So I think the access is gonna be better for consumers
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.360]  and maybe fewer people will go to the bar
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.840]  seeking out that Philadelphia Eagles game.
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:46.920]  I think Apple's gonna get it.
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.280]  Anyway, that's my prediction.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:49.760]  Anyway, stay tuned for that show.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.280]  I think it's gonna be good.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.200]  Thank you once again, Jason, this is fun.
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.040]  Yeah.
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.880]  Except for the Safari Taps part.
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:59.440]  So the J-G.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:26.440]  Why do they call you that?
