[00:00.000 --> 00:07.160]  I feel like we got to talk about the thing which thing my thing. How was your your eyeball? Yeah, I'm game
[00:08.840 --> 00:10.840]  How was your week?
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.560]  I don't know if I don't think I've talked to you about it
[00:16.560 --> 00:20.400]  We haven't we haven't had a working refrigerator in five weeks. Amy mentioned that to me
[00:20.400 --> 00:23.440]  Yeah, it's a hell of a thing and that you're it's like you've got like
[00:23.440 --> 00:31.440]  I mean, obviously you could for five with in the last five weeks. You could have just run out and bought a new refrigerator
[00:31.440 --> 00:34.920]  But you're in you're in some kind of a spat with your refrigerator
[00:35.640 --> 00:41.720]  Well, no, like it's not even just on principle. It's first of all getting a fridge in here requires a crane
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.000]  So that's a whole thing
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.120]  So we were trying to get it fixed because instead of needing to hire a crane to bring a new fridge in and take the old one out
[00:51.120 --> 00:55.520]  Why why would you need a crane? Is this like a steps situation staircase situation?
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.240]  Yeah staircase there are two narrow and and modern refrigerators are in the size of a car
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.120]  Exactly, okay
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.120]  so it's a whole thing and finally
[01:04.920 --> 01:08.920]  They were trying to fix it and I was like fine fix it. I don't care and finally they said okay
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.240]  We can't fix it. Here's two grand and I said great
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.960]  I'll buy a new fridge and then I found out that I needed to get it
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.240]  It repair or need to get it craned in rather and so the two grand doesn't even cover it is
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.960]  It hasn't been good. So what do you what are you doing with your perishable?
[01:25.960 --> 01:29.360]  I mean it is on the other hand you guys are in the midst of record cold
[01:29.360 --> 01:33.240]  So I mean like you could you could keep like frozen stuff outside right?
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.360]  Right, but the temperature fluctuates too much such that like you know if you got your if you got something that only
[01:39.360 --> 01:45.560]  Need only needs to be refrigerated. It's no good. It's no good. It's too cold and then some days it gets warm enough that anything you have out there
[01:45.560 --> 01:51.760]  It's frozen is no good. I got a little mini fridge. That's that's all I've got right now. Did you buy that especially just for this?
[01:52.600 --> 01:55.080]  No, fortunately, I guess it was a wine cooler
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.360]  It's it's it's uh, but it gets down when when you crank it like it's cold as it goes
[01:59.360 --> 02:02.000]  I'm looking at it right now when it get when you crank it down as low as it goes
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  It's it's cold enough to keep some milk and
[02:04.520 --> 02:06.520]  What the hell do I have in there?
[02:06.520 --> 02:08.520]  I got some pasta sauce
[02:08.520 --> 02:09.880]  and
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.240]  some butter
[02:11.240 --> 02:13.480]  I'm living like a savage job. What about ice?
[02:14.440 --> 02:21.160]  That's outside. I can just grab a handful right now. Do you have like ice cubes or do you just taking like snow or something like that?
[02:21.160 --> 02:25.920]  I have not been using ice. I've been drinking my my drinks straight up
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.200]  So how much snow do you have outside studs it? Is it come down at all?
[02:31.200 --> 02:33.840]  You got you I mean is it like up over your your ears?
[02:33.840 --> 02:40.120]  We we crossed 32 degrees. It was above freezing today for the first time in I think the second time in like a month
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.440]  So we lost a little bit today. That was good
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.440]  Like depth wise if I look outside a small child would still be buried
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.440]  Like we got a we got a good couple two three four feet
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.720]  It's crazy
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.640]  Which also doesn't help when you need to get a fridge in and you know like I'm saying this whole thing
[02:59.640 --> 03:03.880]  It's not like I'm just saying no, I refuse to buy a new fridge. I'm trying to buy a new fridge
[03:04.520 --> 03:06.520]  It's still a whole headache
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.280]  It's just one of those things you just never really anticipate having to do without
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.160]  No, exactly. I've never and I've never had to buy one either. I've never bought appliances before for example
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.680]  Imagine like if you're like if your toilet stopped working like it could happen, right?
[03:22.680 --> 03:24.360]  especially
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.880]  You know I think it's a lot more likely that let's say if you live in a small apartment with only one toilet that it could break
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.840]  And then you know you obviously you would you would accelerate
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.440]  You know you'd call your plumber and explain the situation and hopefully get it expedited service
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.120]  But in the meantime, I feel like it would it would never stop you just every 15 minutes
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.120]  You'd forget and you'd go to pee
[03:46.120 --> 03:48.800]  The toilet again. Well, not that you would actually use it
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.400]  I'm sure that by time you know you look at the broken toilet you realize ah crap, but it's like what would you do?
[03:55.400 --> 04:00.840]  I mean, I guess you'd like peanut jar or something. I don't know. I guess I don't know. I hopefully that doesn't come up
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.280]  We got a couple bathrooms so that one I should be good on that one, but only got one fridge, right?
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.520]  But it's the same you know you just take modern you know these modern luxuries for for granted
[04:10.520 --> 04:12.520]  We don't even think of them as luxuries, but they are oh
[04:13.040 --> 04:15.040]  Yeah, well, it's when I was talking to my grandmother
[04:15.040 --> 04:23.360]  She's nine years old and she used to have an ice box like a literal ice box where they would put a piece of ice in there to keep things cold
[04:24.400 --> 04:31.240]  Right, it's just like a big steel box and then a guy would come once a week with like a chunk of like 20 pound block of ice
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.720]  Yeah, like a microwave oven sized block of ice right and drop it in there and then it would yeah, you'd keep your
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.880]  Keep your perishables in there. Well, I think she told me is that you had to drain it all the time
[04:41.880 --> 04:46.400]  Obviously you know you smell that's that's a huge pain to me ass. You're draining your fridge once a day. Right
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.480]  It's crazy
[04:49.480 --> 04:54.800]  But we take it for granted. I have a new appreciation for the goddamn refrigerator. Yeah
[04:55.200 --> 05:03.000]  Well, I'll trade you problems. I don't know. Yeah. Oh, I would trade you in a heartbeat
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  You can have my toilet and my
[05:05.440 --> 05:08.880]  Well, do I have to start from scratch or do I start from where you are now?
[05:08.880 --> 05:15.320]  I just start from where I am now and and you start from where I am because like I feel like I'm I'm near in the end. Oh
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.200]  You could do I'll go back to the beginning years all the way by I don't know
[05:19.200 --> 05:24.760]  I don't know I had I had a lot of 8 a.m. Wake-up calls for this John the service people trying coming 8 a.m
[05:25.280 --> 05:28.520]  You wouldn't like that. I had you know, I had
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.320]  I had 8 a.m. Follow up with my surgeon. All right, all right
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.640]  So what's the difference? So here's the thing I got to talk about it
[05:36.640 --> 05:42.000]  So because it's gonna come out within the next week because I'm missing the Apple event. So a week ago. I
[05:43.600 --> 05:47.200]  Suffered a detached retina in my left eye, which is not good
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.840]  This that's like you can't see type of situation. They're supposed to say just to stay attached all right
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.840]  So that was Tuesday
[05:57.400 --> 06:03.520]  Wednesday one day later. I had surgery at the Will's Eye Hospital right here in Philadelphia
[06:03.520 --> 06:05.520]  I
[06:05.520 --> 06:07.840]  And stars on Yelp five stars
[06:08.800 --> 06:14.720]  They do advertise themselves as the world's finest eye hospital, so I've got that going for me
[06:16.960 --> 06:25.200]  But the is is not a quick recovery. This is a long slow recovery end in the procedure that I had involves a
[06:25.200 --> 06:34.440]  gas bubble injected in the back of my eye that that holds the repaired retina in place
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.880]  So like right in front of the guy went in he repaired my retina
[06:39.360 --> 06:45.880]  Then at the very end of this procedure. They put a gas bubble back there and that's crazy, right?
[06:45.880 --> 06:50.840]  I mean, it's you told me this it's it's when they told me I thought they were making it up
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.600]  It's like a little guy is pushing the retina all the time though, right? I
[06:56.120 --> 06:59.560]  Little bubble little bubble, but it's like it's like you got a little dude in there
[06:59.560 --> 07:05.120]  Just keeping everything in place. Yeah keeping it in place. So it is I was very confused at first
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.400]  I I thought it was that they were saying that there was like a sack or like a balloon filled with gas or something
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.360]  And then I thought oh this sucks because then you know
[07:13.360 --> 07:16.640]  Obviously at some point I'm gonna have to go back and they're gonna have to take this thing out
[07:16.640 --> 07:21.360]  But no, it's just a gas bubble. They just inject the gas and my eye will naturally
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.160]  absorb it over the course of
[07:24.480 --> 07:28.680]  6 to 10 weeks and it will shrink it'll shrink in my field of vision
[07:29.600 --> 07:31.600]  But anyway long story short
[07:32.160 --> 07:34.160]  one of the one of the
[07:35.600 --> 07:38.640]  Results of this is that while I have this gas bubble in my eye
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.480]  I cannot step foot on an airplane or at least I can't step foot in an airplane that is up in the air
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.840]  Yeah, and you're probably not supposed to climb mountains. No. I well, that's recommend it against
[07:49.480 --> 07:51.480]  Okay altitude changes
[07:51.480 --> 07:55.960]  So another way it was explained to me is absolutely positively no no airplanes
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.680]  If you can avoid it don't go to the polka no's or anything like that
[08:00.320 --> 08:01.880]  Okay
[08:01.880 --> 08:09.480]  What about Denver or like well, I would ever I would presume if if the polka no's are are out Denver was Denver's definitely yeah
[08:09.480 --> 08:15.720]  And you know how would I get to Denver and you know I'd have to it would be a long drive long drive
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.760]  So I will miss the Apple event it the which is seven we're recording right now on Monday March 2nd
[08:22.760 --> 08:25.320]  Seven days from now. I will not be able to to make that
[08:25.880 --> 08:29.400]  But they got a live stream. Yeah, I hope so. I don't know. It'll be weird
[08:29.400 --> 08:34.360]  It's for like the old days. I mean, it's you know at least for the first half of the run of daring far ball
[08:34.360 --> 08:41.560]  I never went to the press events. So I got it back out unfortunately of the wool conference too
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.680]  Which is at the end of the month. I said you should just cruise over to Ireland. Yeah, that would be the option
[08:46.680 --> 08:49.080]  So that that conference is in Ireland
[08:49.800 --> 08:53.880]  I guess my only I think that would be my only option would be to to cruise there
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.320]  I looked it up
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.920]  I think it's like an eight day each way cruise which you would have to do
[08:58.920 --> 09:05.960]  and I don't know that they run them until like April or May because it's pretty cold out there right now
[09:06.280 --> 09:08.520]  Right because it wouldn't even be enough to get to
[09:09.400 --> 09:14.600]  England because you know you think you know like when you're booking flights to Ireland or something like that
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.440]  If it goes through Heathrow or something you don't really give it any second thought because it's like
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.200]  It like a 15 minute flight, you know, I mean right
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.800]  But if you can't get in an airplane, you know like the difference between England and Ireland is actually
[09:27.800 --> 09:29.800]  Pretty significant
[09:29.800 --> 09:31.800]  It's decent. Yeah
[09:31.800 --> 09:37.800]  Like it never really it never really matters when you're flying everywhere that Ireland is actually, you know in Ireland
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.840]  But once you can't get in a plane. Yes, it matters
[09:42.680 --> 09:48.120]  Well, so you've you've had to bail on you're bailing on the watch of that unfortunately you're bailing on this conference
[09:48.920 --> 09:55.320]  Are you you just in a bed? What do you have to do? Do they let you walk around? Yeah, I am allowed, you know
[09:55.320 --> 09:57.960]  Obviously, I mean there's been no disruption on
[09:59.960 --> 10:01.960]  Daring fireball
[10:01.960 --> 10:08.600]  Even I was posting it was so it's just weird with the way modern anesthesia works. It's just crazy. It's like at
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.320]  11 o'clock I was high as a kite. They didn't fully put me under
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.880]  Which is terrifying and I know like for anybody who's out there it sounds absolutely positively terrifying that you're awake
[10:20.200 --> 10:22.200]  For some kind of operation on your eye
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.480]  But you're poking at your eye. You're so far out of it
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.640]  That it it really I actually found it to be rather enjoyable like and and modern
[10:32.280 --> 10:33.800]  anesthesia
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.360]  You know, and I've had unfortunately, you know more of it than I would like lately
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.640]  They've really gotten good at making not just putting you under not just making sure that you're out or whatever
[10:45.640 --> 10:47.800]  But actually like making your mood
[10:47.800 --> 10:55.400]  You fork like these guys during or after during. Okay, like when you're in the operating room
[10:55.400 --> 11:00.600]  They at least but with the fine anesthesiologist at the Wills Eye Hospital
[11:01.320 --> 11:03.320]  You feel good
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.560]  So now you're kind of wishing that they had to go back in there and pull this little sack out
[11:08.120 --> 11:10.120]  Well, no, I wouldn't go that far
[11:11.560 --> 11:13.400]  Wasn't that good. No, it wasn't that good
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.520]  But there were moments when I was you know
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.560]  Sort of kind of there like aware of my what I was going on
[11:22.200 --> 11:26.040]  And I have to say it was sort of a euphoria. It was it was a very good feeling
[11:26.440 --> 11:34.760]  But the procedure was like an hour long or so, you know, so 11 to 12. I'm in there. They're operating. I'm out of it for the most part
[11:34.760 --> 11:36.760]  But not unconscious, but
[11:37.400 --> 11:39.800]  And there were moments where I could hear my surgeon talking
[11:39.800 --> 11:47.960]  And you know it was bizarre. It's it's but it's you're so high so crazy crazy high
[11:48.760 --> 11:50.760]  It you know
[11:50.760 --> 11:56.040]  Do you remember anything he said like should he should he be careful about what he's saying when he's working on you?
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.400]  Yeah, obviously I remember one point he was talking about some kind of fold
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.760]  And it was very very clear to me and it was it was a very reassuring. It was it was like
[12:04.760 --> 12:16.360]  He'd an air of competence and okay precision that was inspiring, but it was he was and he was clearly talking to his fellow like
[12:18.200 --> 12:20.360]  You know, I don't know if they call him resident anymore
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.040]  They call them fellows, but in other words a young doctor who's like his padawan effective
[12:25.040 --> 12:32.040]  Okay, yeah, it was clear that he wasn't talking to anybody else in the ER. He certainly wasn't talking to me. He was talking to his
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.040]  fellow
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.920]  And it was something about a fold like in the corner or something something something fold
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.680]  And that you don't want to do it like that you want to do it like this and it was you know
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.080]  Super bait. Did they give you like a little eye tucked? Did they do a little work while you were under?
[12:50.120 --> 12:53.560]  No, no the retina. It was definitely about the retina. It was all right
[12:53.560 --> 12:58.280]  The some part of the torn proportion of the retina. I don't know that it was folded under
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.160]  I don't know something about a fold. I don't know. Maybe they throw in a little plastic surgery while you're under
[13:04.280 --> 13:06.760]  Well, I don't know if so that didn't really help me much
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.360]  Um, but anyway, so you were out and then and then you're back to work
[13:13.320 --> 13:19.000]  By three o'clock. I'm you know, I like noon 11 to 11 to noon is like the mite surgery
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.560]  Uh, you know 1230 or so is when I remember seeing Amy in the recovery room um
[13:28.520 --> 13:33.080]  You know, so apparently I was still out for maybe a half hour after the procedure was over and
[13:33.960 --> 13:37.720]  Uh, I was definitely you know unsteady not right. You know, it's good
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.560]  It's a good thing that they make you have like a you know, they don't sign you out on your own like Amy
[13:43.560 --> 13:50.040]  Yeah, but we literally I mean this is I mean, obviously this whole situation is
[13:50.920 --> 13:53.880]  Very unfortunate run of bad luck, but there's all sorts of
[13:54.840 --> 13:56.840]  It's mixed in with little bits of
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.760]  Good luck
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.920]  Like just by pure coincidence. We certainly didn't pick our house because of it
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.760]  But we we literally live four blocks away from Will's eye hospital. It's less than a five-minute walk
[14:08.840 --> 14:12.200]  It isn't we live incredibly close. So we've walked home, you know
[14:12.200 --> 14:14.680]  It and did you walk there and back? Yeah
[14:15.720 --> 14:21.080]  All right, I mean it's we live it's so close that it wouldn't if there's no better way to do it, right?
[14:21.640 --> 14:27.160]  You know if the way if it were raining or something, I guess we could take a cab, you know, but it would it would make zero sense to drive
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.040]  I mean, there's I mean, I think some people, you know, they do have a parking garage
[14:32.040 --> 14:34.040]  So it would be closer at our house, but it's
[14:34.840 --> 14:37.720]  I think by the time you waited for the elevator in the parking garage
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.160]  And it's all said and done it probably takes about the same amount of time to walk in the front doors
[14:41.160 --> 14:43.160]  It does for my house
[14:43.240 --> 14:46.760]  So we walked home and by like three o'clock. I was writing and reading
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.000]  Working daring fireball
[14:49.000 --> 14:49.560]  It's crazy
[14:49.560 --> 14:53.160]  But now what day was this because maybe we should look at this and yeah, maybe that was
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.160]  Wednesday, so it would have been Wednesday. It's the 25th. I think yeah
[15:00.920 --> 15:03.320]  I will have to check and see if it ain't if any that makes sense
[15:04.200 --> 15:06.200]  And that didn't actually occur to me
[15:07.640 --> 15:09.640]  Maybe I shouldn't have done
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.160]  Like were there any odd posts on Wednesday? I don't know
[15:14.200 --> 15:16.200]  Let me see here. I'm scrolling down
[15:17.880 --> 15:20.840]  Uh, I don't think so. That looks pretty normal
[15:23.240 --> 15:25.240]  All right, they do give you a piece of paper
[15:25.480 --> 15:29.240]  I think I sent this to you because I knew that you would enjoy it. Yeah, here's Wednesday
[15:29.880 --> 15:32.600]  I don't think I was very busy here. I got far ahead man. You
[15:33.240 --> 15:35.240]  Google plans new headquarters
[15:35.240 --> 15:42.200]  Yeah, I think it was you know, it was obviously I was not a prolific, but
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.880]  You know, I could read and write
[15:46.440 --> 15:48.440]  All right
[15:50.280 --> 15:52.280]  What were we saying? What was I?
[15:53.080 --> 15:55.960]  I was just talking about how you've got a you know, you got a bell on this stuff
[15:55.960 --> 16:01.320]  But I'm sharp as a tack that there's no long-term repercussions of the sedatives that they had me up
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.000]  You know, I mean, it's at the basics just though when they first told me that though
[16:05.160 --> 16:08.120]  I you know, you hear what you want to hear and my thought as well
[16:08.840 --> 16:11.160]  You know, I'm not supposed to fly, but I guess I can still do it
[16:11.160 --> 16:13.160]  But no, it's not like a
[16:13.240 --> 16:17.560]  You know, maybe you shouldn't fly. This is you your go blind if you fly
[16:17.960 --> 16:22.040]  Yeah, I hear gas bubble in the eye. I think probably probably don't want to change my
[16:22.680 --> 16:24.200]  My elevation too much
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.080]  Yeah, well, you know like when you take a sealed bag of chips on a plane
[16:27.160 --> 16:28.520]  Like you buy the day airport
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.360]  You buy a bag of chips and you take them on the plane and then when you open it up mid-flight
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.720]  It's puffed out like a balloon because you change an air pressure about that
[16:35.720 --> 16:37.800]  You don't want that in your eyeball no that would I mean
[16:37.800 --> 16:41.560]  I think that's exactly what would happen. I'm not sure that my eye would burst but
[16:42.520 --> 16:45.880]  It's it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's out of the question
[16:47.080 --> 16:48.040]  I wouldn't risk it
[16:48.040 --> 16:51.640]  It would be like that. What was that stupid commercial where the guy was like
[16:53.480 --> 16:58.360]  The guy's getting on airplane and it's like his back hurts and he's oh, it's like a tile and all or something commercial
[16:58.360 --> 17:06.360]  Yeah, no, but she's like we have aspirin and he goes aspirin. I'm not having a heart attack my back hurts
[17:08.760 --> 17:10.600]  I think that guy was a real racist, don't you?
[17:12.920 --> 17:14.920]  Why are racist?
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.440]  Because it was clearly an international flight and she was I think I think was a Japanese airline and she's
[17:21.080 --> 17:23.960]  He's talking to her as if like she doesn't understand English
[17:23.960 --> 17:30.440]  It's like no, no, I'm not having a heart attack. It's my back. She's like yeah, dumbass
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.920]  I didn't read it to that. I just got that like at bear
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.960]  They've had a meeting where they've been so successful
[17:38.600 --> 17:41.720]  With this you know the way that the aspirin is now prescribed
[17:41.800 --> 17:46.840]  You know like if people over a certain age are supposed to pop one aspirin a day and it's just somehow
[17:47.480 --> 17:50.120]  Reasons that you know don't understand don't really know
[17:50.120 --> 17:55.160]  But they just clinical study show if pop an aspirin a day either less chance of heart attack or something
[17:55.720 --> 18:00.120]  I guess it's something like that, but you know aspirin. I've read about it a while ago
[18:00.120 --> 18:05.320]  Like nobody really has any idea how aspirin works like aspirin was just some it because it's ancient, you know, we're not right
[18:05.320 --> 18:08.920]  Right, right. It's like 5,000 years old. We just know it works. All right, I don't even know if it's 5,000
[18:08.920 --> 18:14.280]  But it's you know, it certainly was was widely used like you know in the 1800s or at the end of the 1800s and
[18:14.760 --> 18:18.920]  And you know it was like in the snake oil era and it was something that actually did work
[18:18.920 --> 18:20.920]  You know it does actually decrease pain
[18:23.560 --> 18:30.520]  But I you know you just know the meeting that they had where they're like well now everybody's forgotten that you can take aspirin for pain relief
[18:30.840 --> 18:32.840]  Nobody's forgotten
[18:33.320 --> 18:35.320]  No one thinks it's only for a heart attack
[18:35.880 --> 18:40.280]  Well, could you imagine could you imagine like hitting that little thing to call the flight attendant ding
[18:40.280 --> 18:48.280]  And they come by and I'm holding my eye and I'm like do you have any aspirin my eyeball just burst? Oh?
[18:49.960 --> 18:57.000]  Is it in your hand or is it I mean, what are you picturing? I'm picturing just like a water balloon that pops like it's gone
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.120]  Just gone and I've just and maybe a couple wet knaps to clean up around yeah
[19:02.120 --> 19:09.640]  Also, can you imagine like if you know if you somebody was seeding next to me and
[19:10.920 --> 19:17.800]  Having to apologize because your your eyeball just burst all over them. Well, you just hold the air sick bag up to your face. Yeah
[19:19.240 --> 19:21.240]  I guess
[19:22.200 --> 19:25.480]  Well, anyway, I'm not gonna find out good plan good plan
[19:25.480 --> 19:32.680]  All right 1853 is when we discovered a aspirin thought it was older than that. Yeah, I knew it wasn't ancient
[19:32.680 --> 19:35.800]  But I knew it was like you know like a wild west you're uh, you know
[19:35.880 --> 19:43.420]  Discovery and it's just it's crazy because I know it might be the one and only medical treatment from 1853 that it's still in you
[19:49.640 --> 19:53.080]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor why not
[19:53.080 --> 19:59.720]  Since we're talking about eyeballs why not talk about our good friends at warby Parker. Yes, is it really it is?
[20:00.280 --> 20:03.240]  Oh, I was so hopeful. Oh, it's jackpot
[20:05.240 --> 20:08.520]  Go on. I'm sorry our next sponsor by the way is bear
[20:09.480 --> 20:13.160]  No, it's our good friends at warby Parker you guys know
[20:13.640 --> 20:19.880]  Warby Parker. This is where you go online and you buy eyeglasses and they've got a whole bunch of cool styles to pick from
[20:19.880 --> 20:25.320]  Really great prices the whole idea is that the guys who founded the company, you know
[20:25.320 --> 20:30.480]  They're like how come I glasses cost like $800 when you go to like a place to get good looking eyeglasses well
[20:30.480 --> 20:32.480]  Guess what they don't have to
[20:33.160 --> 20:38.040]  Warby Parker's progressives start at two ninety-five including frames
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.240]  It's for the the older people out there
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.840]  We've got your distance prescription at the top and a transition to a reading lens near the bottom
[20:46.840 --> 20:51.720]  295 that's unheard of it's way less than what you'd pay at at the retail places
[20:53.880 --> 21:00.520]  They use of what's called a digital freeform lens, which is the most advanced progressive technology
[21:00.520 --> 21:06.160]  It's applied digitally with a computer so the design is far more precise than traditional models of progressives
[21:07.160 --> 21:14.640]  It also provides a larger field of vision. So it's just it looks better. You don't see the line between the lenses I used to in the old days
[21:14.640 --> 21:18.840]  And it gives you a better bigger field of vision
[21:20.160 --> 21:27.680]  The other big thing that Warby Parker does huge is absolutely huge every time you buy a pair of prescriptions glasses from a Warby Parker
[21:27.880 --> 21:31.360]  They send a pair to someone in need around the world
[21:32.080 --> 21:36.120]  Millions and millions of people around the world who don't have access to
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.800]  You know corrective vision
[21:39.960 --> 21:41.960]  huge problem
[21:41.960 --> 21:46.720]  Just imagine if everything you went around you couldn't see anything sharply terrible
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.440]  Well, guess what? Warby Parker is helping to solve that because every time you buy glasses from them
[21:52.440 --> 21:54.440]  They send one to someone in need
[21:55.760 --> 21:59.080]  Here's a crazy thing. I know it's when I first heard about Warby Parker years ago
[21:59.080 --> 22:04.400]  I thought well this sounds great, but I how in a world you're gonna buy glasses something that you're just gonna wear like every single day
[22:05.440 --> 22:07.440]  Something that goes right on your face
[22:07.440 --> 22:12.960]  without trying them on first like even if you look at the webpage and you say well those look cool
[22:12.960 --> 22:17.160]  But how do you know they're gonna look on you? I mean, it's crazy like I every time I've ever bought glasses
[22:17.160 --> 22:20.800]  You know even right there in the store you look at some you say well those look cool
[22:20.800 --> 22:23.480]  Then you try them on you're like wow, I look like an idiot in these
[22:24.680 --> 22:30.320]  They have a great try-at-home program you pick like I think it's up to five you get five five picks
[22:30.600 --> 22:33.560]  Find five that you think you like pick pick a variety
[22:33.560 --> 22:37.880]  They send them to you without the lenses, you know the corrective lenses at first
[22:38.520 --> 22:40.520]  Send them to you at home
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.840]  You try them take a couple days ask your friends ask your
[22:45.760 --> 22:48.960]  You know friends and family which ones they like take a look in the mirror
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.840]  And then you pick the one you like the best send the whole thing back to them
[22:53.840 --> 22:55.720]  It's all pre-shipping it's all pre-labeled
[22:55.720 --> 22:59.240]  You know you don't have to do any kind of work other than just hand it off back to the UPS guy
[22:59.240 --> 23:05.820]  And boom like a couple days later your glasses brand new glasses come with the actual lenses
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.280]  Could not be easier
[23:08.280 --> 23:14.000]  We I don't even I've lost count of how many warby Parker glasses. We've got land around the house now between
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.040]  between me and Amy great great stuff. They do sunglasses
[23:20.040 --> 23:24.720]  All sorts of styles to pick from really could not be easier. It's a great thing
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.880]  Once people once you start buying glasses from warby Parker you're not going to go back
[23:29.960 --> 23:34.360]  Where do you go to find out more go to their website warby parker dot com
[23:35.680 --> 23:41.440]  Slash the talk show and then you'll know that they'll know that you came from here and
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.120]  Use that code. I think they send you I think it's expedited shipping
[23:47.400 --> 23:52.280]  You'll give you free three-day shipping on your glasses if you use that
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.600]  That code warby parker dot com slash the talk show
[23:58.240 --> 24:02.040]  I was hoping I went there. I was hoping maybe I could get a designer eye patch. Oh
[24:02.520 --> 24:08.000]  I was just looking for monocles. They do not sell monocles currently. Yeah, see that's it could be a problem for me
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.320]  If this doesn't I mean a prognosis is good. I mean it's and everybody you know if anyway
[24:13.320 --> 24:17.040]  I hope I made that clear that you know after this procedure I had last week
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.600]  I went back the next day and they took a look and they said it looks quote-unquote great for day one
[24:22.600 --> 24:25.320]  So you know I have a good prognosis here
[24:25.320 --> 24:28.040]  I don't want any but I'm only I'm only I hate even going public with it
[24:28.040 --> 24:35.200]  But I have to because I feel like I have to explain why I'm not at the Apple event and I absolutely have to explain why I won't be speaking as scheduled at
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.920]  Ooh
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.280]  I feel like if you just drop out of a speaking event people are gonna. I think you're a flake
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.840]  You know and I want people right you got a you got a pretty good excuse that you'd prefer to keep both your eyeballs
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.840]  I
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.680]  Know that there's anybody who's that dedicated that they would voluntarily go blind in one eye to make it
[24:55.520 --> 24:59.120]  Happy a really good conference. I've heard good things about all but oh my god
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.680]  Can you imagine how uncomfortable that would be if that was the subject of my talk? I hope you like this talk
[25:06.480 --> 25:08.480]  I went blind to be here
[25:09.840 --> 25:13.560]  You get quite a round of applause at the end. No, I think people would feel terrible
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.800]  I think that you have everybody I mean because it would it would be such a sign that you're you know mentally ill
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.960]  All right, maybe right like watching somebody destroy themself
[25:25.560 --> 25:27.560]  Be terrible
[25:28.640 --> 25:31.880]  All right, I think you made the right call you know, I mentioned but I should go back
[25:31.880 --> 25:35.000]  I'm the worst but with the Warby Parker, you know that
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.400]  The 295 is for the progressives their regular ones if you don't need progressives by the way
[25:40.400 --> 25:45.440]  I just feel obligated to go back and mention this they started just 95 bucks including the lenses
[25:45.440 --> 25:53.120]  So it I don't want to leave the impression that you got to pay 300 bucks for for glasses 100 bucks get you had high quality pair of glasses
[25:55.760 --> 25:59.120]  And and anyway, what else what's going on? I
[26:00.080 --> 26:03.280]  Think there's some kind of a watch coming out. Yeah, what about the?
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.760]  Before we talk about that we could talk about the pebble color. What's is that what it's called? It's called pebble or a little time
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.760]  right pebble time
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.600]  Because you know it's a watch so well and you I know I have a pebble
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.720]  Which I had never really got into wearing. I don't think I ever wore it for more than like a day
[26:24.120 --> 26:30.440]  But I know that you you have a original first gen pebble and you've worn it regularly I did I
[26:31.760 --> 26:34.720]  stopped wearing it I think I wore it for two or three months and
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.920]  And you know, I bought it. I think for the same reason you did just out of curiosity because when the the Kickstarter was announced
[26:40.920 --> 26:43.240]  She's like a year and a half two years ago even
[26:44.320 --> 26:52.200]  It was a curiosity and nothing else like it existed and it was I think what was it about a hundred bucks or so
[26:52.200 --> 26:54.200]  I think it was a hundred bucks
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.680]  It wasn't outlandish. I mean it wasn't it wasn't much more than that. It might have even been a little less than that and
[27:00.480 --> 27:02.480]  I said, you know, this seems interesting and
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.200]  I think I enjoyed it a little more than you did, but it's to me
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.280]  It's it's sort of proved the concept of having a
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  watch connected to your phone
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.480]  because
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.280]  I think even now I think even after the Apple watch comes out people are gonna say, you know, what the heck do you need that for?
[27:19.280 --> 27:21.280]  You've got your phone, but
[27:21.720 --> 27:24.200]  When you're driving, it's great. You can glance at your wrist
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.320]  When you're in a meeting when you're you know talking to somebody else the whole lot easier to just look at your wrist real quick
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.160]  then pull out your phone and you know figure out what's going on there and I did find that it was you know
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.040]  Not the most valuable thing in the world, but it was certainly a
[27:38.600 --> 27:44.040]  Useful accessory to the phone in a way that without trying it. I might not have believed
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.040]  My big one of my big complaints with it my two big complaints
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.600]  I guess were that one I didn't feel like I was getting fine grained enough
[27:53.080 --> 27:55.080]  Control over which notifications
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.320]  Like with the pebble specifically with pebble specifically. It was more or less all notifications
[28:00.680 --> 28:03.080]  Anything, you know, you if you pair it with your phone
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.400]  With your iPhone then anything that would be a notification on your phone is a notification on your pebble and I
[28:10.080 --> 28:16.200]  Tend to have my phone set up to not I don't get a lot of notifications period. I you know most things I have turned off
[28:16.800 --> 28:22.080]  Yeah, I only get email notifications for my VIPs, et cetera, which is like I
[28:22.080 --> 28:28.160]  I think I was just talking to someone. I don't know if it was on the show or where but it it's like one of the best features
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.920]  Apples come up with like a little feature that you take for granted, but right?
[28:31.920 --> 28:35.440]  Yeah, they barely even notice, but then you know if you stop and think hey
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.960]  I'm only getting emails from you know my mom and the wife and whoever it's it's very nice
[28:39.960 --> 28:42.800]  Yeah, but there's so many little things that really
[28:45.440 --> 28:47.880]  Just little notifications that I do want on my phone
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.880]  But I don't want on my watch and the fact that I couldn't turn them off made it feel like my watch was annoying me
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.400]  Now was that I think that's how it was initially I think eventually
[28:56.400 --> 28:58.200]  I you know I stop using as well
[28:58.200 --> 29:04.000]  But I think eventually you did get a little more fine-grained control as far as some things that would notify on the phone
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.320]  Only and not on the yeah, maybe and this you know I might be speaking from old experience, you know
[29:09.320 --> 29:16.480]  But maybe it's but it's just but I also did not I also found it the the physical sensation of the vibration to be unpleasant
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.800]  Even for things I wanted the pebble to notify me about like a text message, right?
[29:20.800 --> 29:25.480]  I get text message is one that I would think anybody wants, you know my wife texts me
[29:25.480 --> 29:30.160]  I want the I do want it on my watch if I if my watch is gonna show me anything that's something
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.520]  I would want I found the vibration to be physically unpleasant not like in a big way, but
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.200]  In it never once made me happy that my watch buds
[29:39.840 --> 29:42.960]  Well, so you've you've tried on an Apple watch, right?
[29:42.960 --> 29:48.400]  And and you and they showed you the the TAPTIC sensor right other TAPTIC feedback so
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.120]  You can compare the two. I have not yeah, it's a completely different sensation
[29:53.120 --> 29:56.120]  I've said this before, but it's it's not the TAPTIC thing
[29:56.480 --> 30:01.760]  You know, and I know that TAPTIC is a word that they've made up, you know that it's TAPTIC plus HAPTIC but
[30:02.760 --> 30:10.080]  It's really is a kind of great name like I'm should I get some point once they had the thing working and somebody said TAPTIC
[30:10.080 --> 30:17.000]  Everybody in a room. I'm sure it was like that's it because it does feel like it's tapping you and it's not at all like a vibrator
[30:17.200 --> 30:22.800]  You know a phone vibrator. It sounds I mean it sounds weird. I mean it is weird
[30:22.800 --> 30:28.800]  It's different, but it's in it's not unpleasant. It's in it to me solves a very real problem that the
[30:29.280 --> 30:35.720]  At least the original pebble definitely had which is that of a little the vibrating engine vibration motor. Yeah, right?
[30:35.720 --> 30:42.640]  Are just not pleasant sensation? Well, so I the thing to me about the new one the the pebble time was
[30:43.080 --> 30:48.560]  It looks very nice and it's interesting to me that it's gonna be one of the first devices out there using a
[30:49.080 --> 30:51.240]  Color E-ink display
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.720]  Because none of the you know like the nooks and and the kindles are all still black and white E-ink
[30:56.480 --> 31:02.840]  but it seems very much geared at Android users because they just can't get the level of
[31:02.840 --> 31:10.360]  You know connection to the system on iOS that they want right and I think that's sort of unfortunate because it'd be nice
[31:10.360 --> 31:12.360]  If there were competitors
[31:12.360 --> 31:18.000]  They've worked with the iPhone, but I think it's I think if they're carving out a niche in the market
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.720]  It's it's on the Android side. Yeah, even though I think the original one
[31:21.720 --> 31:28.080]  I think probably was Laura. I maybe was it even iPhone first, right? Wasn't it like that their Android software took a while
[31:28.080 --> 31:35.840]  It's definitely yeah, that sounds right. All right. I think that it that because of the enthusiast market and the kickstarter market
[31:36.560 --> 31:40.720]  Especially from from a couple years ago when Kickstarter was you know
[31:41.440 --> 31:47.600]  Little bit less well-known, you know, it was definitely the iPhone. I think made up a much bigger part of their market
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.880]  Right, but I think it's inevitable. I think you're exactly right though
[31:50.880 --> 31:52.880]  They're right now. It's inevitable because they need
[31:52.880 --> 31:58.400]  They crave more control on the phone and the iPhone just doesn't offer it
[31:59.120 --> 32:05.680]  Well, and I think so I think that's it's interesting because in this space Apple's making a device and
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.120]  You know Apple's answer is going to be get the Apple watch. That's the one that works best with the iPhone
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.440]  but I got a
[32:13.440 --> 32:19.360]  Doorbell I got a doorbell called the ring and it's a video doorbell and it connects to your phone
[32:19.360 --> 32:23.440]  And it's great it rings your phone wherever you are when somebody's at the door
[32:23.440 --> 32:27.520]  So if you're not at home or you know, whatever you can tell UPS got to leave a package
[32:27.520 --> 32:32.800]  Whatever, but the biggest issue that I have with it is that I keep my phone on silent most of the time and
[32:33.360 --> 32:37.760]  On the iPhone the only thing that can override the silent switch is your alarm clock and
[32:38.560 --> 32:41.840]  If I could have one other thing do it it would be this doorbell
[32:42.640 --> 32:45.920]  Because I want that notification any time that it happens
[32:45.920 --> 32:50.000]  And it's something where I don't think Apple's likely to ever make a doorbell
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.920]  But because the system is locked down enough it means that nobody else can make one that has that level of
[32:56.880 --> 33:01.760]  Access and you know, you see it with the watch you see it with with a bunch of things and it's I think in this case
[33:02.480 --> 33:05.840]  You know, there's an answer. It's get an Apple watch and that will have all the
[33:06.400 --> 33:11.120]  Authority that you need but in a lot of other cases. I think there's sort of missed opportunities right now
[33:11.120 --> 33:18.400]  Yeah, I think it's you know, it's an unfortunate side effect, you know, and I don't think it's purely I think
[33:18.800 --> 33:21.360]  Plays into it. I mean, let's face it. There's a little bit of
[33:22.640 --> 33:24.640]  Competitive spite
[33:24.640 --> 33:31.680]  So your doorbell thing you can like if you're away you can then use an app or something to talk through the intercom
[33:31.920 --> 33:36.880]  Yeah, so it's it's the whole thing is it's got a little video camera and it's got a battery
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.880]  and they ring the doorbell just like you ring a normal doorbell, but
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.020]  Then it rings on your phone and you accept the call and you can see them. They can't see you, but
[33:46.640 --> 33:48.640]  It's you know, so the
[33:49.520 --> 33:56.000]  Their angle is a security angle that I guess a lot of breaking and entering the very first thing they do is ring the doorbell to make sure nobody's home
[33:56.720 --> 34:00.800]  And with this you can your home no matter where you are is sort of the way they pitch it
[34:02.320 --> 34:04.320]  You know, it's not necessarily the
[34:04.320 --> 34:11.840]  Yeah, I'm not necessarily that interested in that aspect of it, but it is nice to have a little intercom without needing to run a whole bunch of wires
[34:12.560 --> 34:18.880]  And it's great except for like I said if I've got my phone on silent or if I've got it on do not disturb and somebody
[34:19.200 --> 34:23.120]  Wants to deliver a package at eight in the morning and I've got my phone set up to not bother me
[34:23.760 --> 34:25.760]  Suddenly the doorbell doesn't ring
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.080]  Which is sort of unfortunate
[34:28.080 --> 34:37.600]  All right, yeah, and like the way that the alarm app can override that is is black magic because the it's only the built-in system
[34:38.880 --> 34:43.440]  Alarm, you know clock app that has the ability to go outside the you know
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.720]  The
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.360]  Privileges, you know like I don't think there's I'm 99% sure there's no way that any third party alarm clock app
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.400]  No, I can do those things. I think they're all a bit a bit of a disadvantage because of that, but
[34:58.960 --> 35:04.240]  You know in that case again the built-in alarm clock app is pretty good. It's decent
[35:05.200 --> 35:11.440]  But yeah for other stuff. There's there's just no way around it. Yeah, that's a perfect example though of the and it of the sort of thing
[35:11.440 --> 35:14.440]  That you just don't think about right and it's you know in the way that like
[35:15.200 --> 35:18.320]  You know Apple isn't trying to build everything right?
[35:18.320 --> 35:22.040]  I mean, they've only you know that watches their first new products, you know in five years
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.640]  You know, they're just they're not building thermostats and doorbells and security cameras and et cetera
[35:27.640 --> 35:29.640]  etcetera and you know somebody else is and
[35:30.600 --> 35:32.600]  once you you know
[35:32.600 --> 35:35.160]  Sit there and think well how if we reinvented the doorbell?
[35:35.160 --> 35:39.880]  What would we do and you start thinking of cool things you could do with notifications and apps and you know Wi-Fi?
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.440]  I guess you haven't under Wi-Fi right? Yeah, yeah, it's brilliant. It's really clever. I like that
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.440]  It is and it's but it's it's something where I don't necessarily have that much hope that this will change
[35:50.440 --> 35:56.160]  But it's something where I think if you get enough of these types of products where they do need these higher privileges
[35:56.160 --> 35:59.880]  You know, higher access to the system and I'm willing to give it to it
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.320]  That's really the thing is I want the app to be able to say no matter what you get to ring
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.080]  Yeah, I almost feel like it's almost at this point. It's almost like it would be confused
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.120]  But I could see it like I would like to give this app a
[36:12.560 --> 36:19.680]  Get out of do not disturb, you know privilege right and and yeah, you don't want to you don't want to have games asking for this
[36:19.680 --> 36:22.600]  You don't want to have I don't even know most things asking for this
[36:22.600 --> 36:28.320]  But I can look at this as a user and say this thing should have it and I would bet that there's you know
[36:28.320 --> 36:35.640]  a half dozen types of these products that could use the levels of access that the alarm clock alarm clock app have and
[36:36.480 --> 36:39.760]  You know, I like I said, I don't hold that a whole lot of hope that that'll ever happen
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.640]  But I certainly hope that these people are talking to Apple and saying look you're not going to make this and we're trying to make it as as
[36:45.640 --> 36:51.160]  Top quality and experience for your users as we can and I think I think on Android
[36:51.160 --> 36:54.760]  There's at least you know, I don't have enough experience with it to say they could definitely do this
[36:54.760 --> 36:59.600]  But there's definitely more flexibility and more access on that side where you know
[36:59.600 --> 37:01.600]  We just don't have it on the iPhone
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.160]  With Pebble I never really wrote about it on during firewall because I always felt a little bad
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.600]  And I often I'll complain about other people grading somebody on a curve or something
[37:11.600 --> 37:17.120]  And I don't feel it's quite that way because I like the idea of Pebble. I like they seem like a good company
[37:17.960 --> 37:24.440]  I'm rooting for them and I really felt bad like I just didn't I couldn't get myself to just really write about it
[37:24.440 --> 37:25.920]  Because if I were gonna write about it
[37:25.920 --> 37:29.640]  I'd have to be honest and if I were honest it would be a very negative review
[37:29.640 --> 37:35.860]  And I just didn't want to do it, you know, I'd rather say nothing than you know
[37:35.860 --> 37:41.780]  Because until you get on the podcast anyway exactly and I feel like that's sort of the fun thing about having a podcast
[37:41.780 --> 37:43.220]  It's a little bit
[37:43.220 --> 37:47.660]  You know like I can use the intonation of my voice and and it conveys it
[37:47.660 --> 37:50.940]  I think I think everybody listening to this can kind of knows what I'm saying, right?
[37:51.380 --> 37:53.740]  It's it's it's easier to be
[37:55.300 --> 37:58.260]  I put some emotion into it. Maybe to put it better way
[37:58.260 --> 38:03.140]  So I bought I signed up for the new one too, even though I don't expect not to like it either
[38:03.140 --> 38:08.460]  But I like them enough that I got the cheapest Pebble time that I could you know
[38:08.460 --> 38:12.980]  I looked at it and I thought it's so close to the Apple watch and
[38:13.540 --> 38:14.820]  I'm interested in it
[38:14.820 --> 38:20.740]  But it doesn't seem like there's any real benefit to getting it ahead of time if if I were a consumer just a pure consumer
[38:20.740 --> 38:26.260]  I would not have done bought it. I feel like for whatever I paid for it the 200 bucks or whatever
[38:26.820 --> 38:28.820]  I can I can
[38:28.820 --> 38:34.340]  It's a perfectly valid business expense. Yeah. It's cost doing business for you. Absolutely. Well
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.940]  The thing to me was that again
[38:36.260 --> 38:41.620]  It seemed very clear that the Android experience for this was going to be superior to the iOS experience and
[38:42.580 --> 38:44.580]  Because Apple was now making a watch
[38:45.140 --> 38:47.860]  They're not going to be inclined to make it any better for Pebble
[38:48.820 --> 38:51.860]  So it that to me scared me off with it a little bit
[38:51.860 --> 38:56.340]  I was also interested that they did another kickstarter on this. Yeah, I thought that was a matter of all
[38:56.340 --> 38:59.060]  Yeah, I thought it well. Yeah, cuz I bought it from their kickstarter
[38:59.380 --> 39:05.220]  Right, but I mean just the I think it was two or three years ago kickstarter had a blog post and it said kickstarter is not a store
[39:05.620 --> 39:09.220]  Yeah, that was the headline of a blog post right and
[39:10.020 --> 39:14.660]  Now this product. I think it's supposed to ship in May which is two months from now
[39:15.460 --> 39:17.460]  kickstarter's a store for this product
[39:18.420 --> 39:22.340]  Yeah, totally. I mean there's there's no other way to look at this than that
[39:22.340 --> 39:26.020]  You're buying this and in two months you'll have it and and you're not really
[39:26.580 --> 39:30.580]  You're not backing it to make it come into existence if you don't buy it there
[39:30.580 --> 39:35.380]  You're gonna be able to buy it somewhere else in two months no matter what so I think they opened this thing six days ago
[39:35.940 --> 39:38.980]  sometime last week it was yeah within the past week or so
[39:39.300 --> 39:42.660]  Although I seem to recall it was before my incident, but anyway
[39:42.900 --> 39:46.180]  They've already raised twelve million dollars, which is crazy. It's great
[39:46.580 --> 39:50.740]  They want they had a five hundred thousand dollar goal. Which they knew they were gonna read. Yeah, they knew they were gonna blow through that
[39:50.740 --> 39:55.380]  Right, but they've got twelve million and are they the top?
[39:55.380 --> 40:01.780]  I was looking a few days ago at the top projects and the pebble was like number three and the pebble time was already number four
[40:02.180 --> 40:07.540]  Yeah, and the pebble was number one for a long time like right. It was the
[40:08.580 --> 40:11.460]  It had sat at number one for like the longest period of anybody
[40:12.580 --> 40:18.980]  I also like I know that they've hired some people with who who were interaction designers for web OS
[40:18.980 --> 40:22.100]  I think maybe all the way back to when it was a palm project
[40:22.100 --> 40:24.100]  Which I've always thought was a great
[40:24.180 --> 40:28.340]  Design for an operating system like without any hesitation
[40:28.340 --> 40:35.140]  I would say this you know second only to iOS and the one with the most ideas that I kind of feel like we're better than iOS
[40:35.940 --> 40:38.420]  But and then almost none of them got picked up anywhere
[40:38.580 --> 40:42.820]  No, no, but like the way they did notifications with a thing at the bottom
[40:43.300 --> 40:47.700]  I mean, it's you know, we have it a lot now. They're you know, they're like what on iOS? We call banners
[40:47.700 --> 40:54.260]  But on the web OS they were at the bottom and they should everything was designed from the get go to support them
[40:54.260 --> 40:57.780]  So whatever was on your interface would shrink to go above it
[40:58.420 --> 41:00.420]  You know, okay
[41:00.420 --> 41:03.300]  Just all sorts of little things like that not that that's you know
[41:03.300 --> 41:05.300]  Not that the bottom is that much greater than the top
[41:05.300 --> 41:08.100]  But there's so many little things about web OS that were really nice
[41:08.340 --> 41:12.540]  You know and you know a lot of them have come to Android and iOS now
[41:12.540 --> 41:20.260]  You know the card-based interface for switching is you know was web OS and they've they've just looking at the video for the new
[41:20.260 --> 41:22.860]  Pebble time there's so many little bits of
[41:24.060 --> 41:30.980]  Animation and I'm impressed. I mean, I'm it and it looked like it was all straight forward like that they were shooting actual
[41:30.980 --> 41:33.420]  Prototypes like it wasn't like that. They right it wasn't
[41:34.540 --> 41:35.980]  Yeah
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.980]  So that's impressive for e-ink. I think and it you know
[41:39.980 --> 41:49.100]  It just shows it was a glaring weak spot in the 1.0 Pebble OS the interaction design of that thing was it really felt like like a device from
[41:49.340 --> 41:51.340]  the early 90s no animation
[41:52.140 --> 41:56.380]  Everything just sort of jump from one thing to another and no real sense of
[41:57.660 --> 42:02.860]  What would you call it even space reality? I don't know like place like where am I in the watch?
[42:03.420 --> 42:05.900]  Right, you were just always looking at whatever was there and then
[42:05.900 --> 42:10.660]  Swiping to a completely new right wiping the whole screen and getting a new look at it
[42:10.660 --> 42:13.020]  Yeah, right. So they've come up with you know
[42:13.020 --> 42:19.020]  Is it actually going to be useful? I don't know, but it to me at least it's novel, which to me is always impressive
[42:19.580 --> 42:28.180]  And it sounds like it could be good this timeline interface where older stuff is up and future stuff is down and
[42:28.700 --> 42:30.700]  The moment right now is in the middle
[42:30.700 --> 42:36.220]  So if you want to look at what you were doing yesterday, you go up and you can see like what was my step count yesterday?
[42:37.020 --> 42:41.100]  I guess where was I yesterday and if you want to see where you have to go tomorrow
[42:41.100 --> 42:43.260]  You go down and it'll say well, here's you know
[42:43.260 --> 42:47.020]  Here's your schedule for tomorrow and then you hit the middle button and you're back to now
[42:47.180 --> 42:50.540]  Here's the time and what's going on right now. I think yeah, I
[42:51.180 --> 42:56.620]  Think it was a pretty impressive response because obviously when was the apple watch announced?
[42:56.620 --> 43:02.540]  Last September. Yeah, so I'm presumably they were already working on this
[43:02.540 --> 43:06.700]  But and they you know had a sense that something might be coming from apple
[43:06.860 --> 43:12.140]  But then suddenly apple announces it and they're trying to compete with that obviously as a smart watch
[43:12.300 --> 43:17.340]  But it's a very different product. They're not they didn't suddenly say you know what we better put a touch screen on there
[43:17.340 --> 43:20.580]  And it's got to be a proper you know LED display
[43:21.340 --> 43:23.340]  Or LCD display rather
[43:23.340 --> 43:29.420]  Uh, you know they they stuck with what they had which was the e-paper and improved upon that in a way that
[43:29.820 --> 43:32.060]  Makes it a different product and not sort of a
[43:32.860 --> 43:39.260]  Direct competitor to the apple watch. Yeah, definitely. I think if anything if if apple watch has had any influence on
[43:39.980 --> 43:43.500]  This at all. I would guess it's only the timing that maybe that's you know
[43:44.460 --> 43:49.500]  It lit a fire at least you mean yeah, you know that I mean they expect to ship them in May
[43:49.500 --> 43:54.300]  I mean, but maybe that was a good and maybe it was really just motivation that knowing that you know
[43:54.300 --> 43:58.140]  When apple finally de-clocked the watch in September and set early 20
[43:58.860 --> 44:04.620]  15 that it really motivated the people who work at pebble to let's we got a ship before they do
[44:04.620 --> 44:08.380]  You know, we always have to announce before they do it's a good motivation
[44:08.540 --> 44:12.540]  But I would bet though that the the design of this was already largely in place
[44:13.020 --> 44:15.180]  And it certainly is true to the original pebble
[44:15.180 --> 44:22.220]  A vision and that's to me is also why these guys are so interesting to watch is they clearly have a very different
[44:23.900 --> 44:27.500]  Just basic idea for what a little wrist smart
[44:28.220 --> 44:32.940]  Computer would be like then apple does well, and it's much simpler. It's you know, it's
[44:33.900 --> 44:40.140]  The technology inside of it is a lot simpler, which means it's cheaper means at last for what do they say like seven to 10 days? I think
[44:40.140 --> 44:47.260]  I know the first one did which was definitely true in my experience. Yeah. Oh absolutely the first one definitely had a good battery life and
[44:48.300 --> 44:52.940]  Apple still hasn't announced an actual battery life, but they're saying charge it every night, right?
[44:52.940 --> 44:55.740]  Right, so that to me is definitely
[44:56.540 --> 44:59.820]  Not a good thing. I mean, I don't think it'll affect things too negatively
[44:59.820 --> 45:02.380]  But I'd rather not have to charge a watch every single night
[45:02.780 --> 45:08.380]  Right, or to know that if you're only going away for an overnight, you know, like just one overnight
[45:08.380 --> 45:13.260]  I'm gonna be in New York, you know for 48 hours that you still have to take your charger
[45:13.660 --> 45:16.780]  Right and and it's a different charger than everything else you've got so
[45:17.500 --> 45:20.300]  You've got your charger for your phone and your laptop and now you're watch
[45:21.420 --> 45:24.540]  Right, and it's totally understandable. Why I you know, although
[45:25.180 --> 45:31.340]  I wonder like because to me the way forward would be to get the iPhone on the magnetic charger
[45:31.340 --> 45:35.500]  I mean clearly a lightning port is never gonna happen on a watch because they would be horrible
[45:35.500 --> 45:37.500]  um
[45:37.580 --> 45:40.300]  But a magnetic charger for the iPhone that I could see that
[45:42.380 --> 45:45.740]  In terms of like decreasing the number of things you have to pack with you
[45:45.900 --> 45:48.940]  But on the other hand like when you travel I always you know
[45:49.020 --> 45:53.180]  I charge my phone right before I go to sleep and so if I have to charge the phone and the watch
[45:53.260 --> 45:55.900]  I still I don't see how you get out of two chargers
[45:55.900 --> 45:59.820]  But at least you maybe you know, you don't have to worry that you've picked the wrong one
[45:59.820 --> 46:06.140]  Right, well, I guess the the other thing that I sort of don't understand is that there's definitely been talk of using
[46:06.700 --> 46:12.540]  The Taptic feedback to wake you up in the morning. No. Yeah. Yeah, if you're charging the watch overnight
[46:12.940 --> 46:14.940]  That's not gonna work obviously right
[46:15.900 --> 46:20.380]  Yeah, I don't get it. I know Johnny. I've I think it was I don't think they talked about it at the event
[46:20.380 --> 46:23.980]  But I think there was some kind of interview with Johnny. I've like maybe it was the Vanity Fair
[46:24.220 --> 46:27.820]  Conference that he was interviewed at and he mentioned it. It's a great
[46:27.820 --> 46:32.700]  Uh alarm clock and immediately you were like I'm messaging me like wow
[46:33.500 --> 46:36.940]  That was that gonna work right if you you'll charge it every night
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.020]  And then you'll remember at four in the morning to wake up
[46:41.340 --> 46:44.860]  Put it on. Yeah, like you have to set your iPhone alarm to remind you
[46:45.500 --> 46:48.300]  There you go. Unfortunately that alarm goes no matter what
[46:49.660 --> 46:53.820]  So your iPhone alarm will go off you'll put the watch on and then four hours later you'll wake up
[46:53.820 --> 47:00.380]  Right there is some talk. I forget where it came out like in the drips and drabs of stuff that's coming out in the last few weeks
[47:01.580 --> 47:04.620]  There's something that came out of that it might charge very quickly
[47:05.100 --> 47:08.700]  That it won't take all night to charge so that it'll charge pretty fast
[47:08.940 --> 47:12.140]  And that might not even be because the charging technology is all that fast
[47:12.140 --> 47:15.500]  But simply that it's such a tiny battery got a tiny battery right
[47:15.500 --> 47:20.700]  Right it can't have that big a battery given how given how big it is right that maybe like an iPad
[47:20.700 --> 47:23.740]  That that was charging at the same rate would take a week
[47:24.300 --> 47:27.580]  But but the watch can charge in half an hour or something like that
[47:28.220 --> 47:33.660]  And did they say anything is the bigger watch gonna have a bigger battery? It must right
[47:34.940 --> 47:43.420]  I mean why wouldn't it I can't imagine that I can't imagine that they would put a smaller battery in it just so that it has the same
[47:44.380 --> 47:50.060]  You know and you know presumably it's going to need the laws of physics would say that it's right going to need a bigger
[47:50.060 --> 47:55.340]  It's going to the screen is going to use more energy because it has it so that actually the question is is will it have
[47:55.580 --> 47:57.100]  Longer battery life
[47:57.100 --> 48:01.580]  Right is it like an iPhone 66 plus type thing where the bigger one is going to have notice
[48:01.580 --> 48:07.260]  It'll be better battery life or is it the other way around or maybe maybe the extra size of the screen
[48:08.220 --> 48:12.540]  It's up all the extra battery life that they can fit in there. I don't know. It's a good question
[48:13.180 --> 48:17.900]  I guess we'll see in a week maybe yeah, I hadn't really thought about this for whatever reason
[48:17.900 --> 48:23.180]  Selfishly I had known that if I get one of these I'm gonna want 42 millimeters
[48:23.420 --> 48:24.780]  Not the 38 millimeter
[48:24.780 --> 48:29.180]  So I haven't really thought about the 38 millimeter ones and then when it comes to cost I haven't really
[48:29.980 --> 48:35.580]  Like the game that everybody's playing, you know, the last two weeks including me. I mean, I'm not pointing figures
[48:36.700 --> 48:42.300]  But you know how much of these things gonna cost I hadn't occurred to me that the 38 millimeter one would cost less
[48:42.300 --> 48:48.060]  Right at any level aluminum steel to gold gold it makes out of with the gold right
[48:48.540 --> 48:55.100]  Right because even if the price isn't really based on the price of gold. It there's the illusion that it is right
[48:55.740 --> 48:59.420]  Yeah, so if you if you if they were the same price then somebody's getting something for free
[49:00.220 --> 49:06.060]  Right right it feels like it actually feels like you're getting ripped off if they're the same price if you're giving the big one
[49:06.780 --> 49:08.300]  or the smaller one
[49:08.300 --> 49:12.140]  But anyway, we can talk about pricing in a moment. We should but with pebble
[49:12.140 --> 49:13.820]  I don't know at the bottom line
[49:13.820 --> 49:19.740]  I'm very impressed by what they showed I don't think I'm gonna like it and I think you're right that maybe it's not even
[49:19.980 --> 49:26.220]  Fair because I'm an iPhone user, but I'm rude. I'm certainly rooting for them. Oh, I think it's I think it's certainly great to have
[49:26.540 --> 49:31.580]  anybody in the space doing something to compete with Apple and doing something different where hopefully
[49:31.980 --> 49:36.940]  Some ideas cross pollinate instead of you know somebody coming directly head on and and you're just
[49:36.940 --> 49:39.420]  Trying to match features here. It's something where
[49:40.380 --> 49:45.100]  Pebble has some very different ideas. Yeah, potentially it changes the way you do things on both platforms
[49:45.260 --> 49:48.940]  Android Wear I think one of the things that to me was a little surprising about
[49:49.900 --> 49:56.940]  The when the Apple watch was unveiled in September was how at least at the hardware level
[49:57.020 --> 50:03.980]  It's sort of the same basic idea as Android Wear right like it's you know a phone type display
[50:03.980 --> 50:09.740]  You know whether it's IPS or whether it's OLED or whatever it sounds like Apple's is going to be OLED because they want the
[50:09.900 --> 50:12.460]  Blacks to you know they want the deeper blacks
[50:14.140 --> 50:19.900]  But it's whatever the actual technology. It's a you know a light-up bright color phone display
[50:20.220 --> 50:25.060]  With a touch screen, you know, it's take a take a modern smartphone and shrink it to your watch
[50:25.220 --> 50:27.700]  Right at a fundamental level now
[50:27.700 --> 50:33.620]  I think Apple watch is clearly more ambitious than Android Wear in terms of having apps actually on the watch and Android Wear
[50:33.620 --> 50:38.900]  Is a little bit more about just showing you these cards that are based on your Google now
[50:39.780 --> 50:46.180]  Profile it's more like here's all the stuff Google knows about you Google knows you have a flight tomorrow because your gmail
[50:46.340 --> 50:50.260]  adds the flight confirmation from the airline and so they put a card on here and
[50:50.580 --> 50:53.300]  Since they know you have a flight and you're going to
[50:54.420 --> 50:56.020]  You know on San Francisco
[50:56.340 --> 50:59.380]  Then they know to put a card on there that has your weather for San Francisco
[50:59.380 --> 51:00.660]  You know it's this hard-based interface
[51:00.660 --> 51:05.300]  But just at the hardware level, you know, it's this one-day of battery life
[51:06.020 --> 51:09.620]  Bluetooth connection to your phone with a bright color screen and
[51:10.180 --> 51:12.180]  Pebble has a very different
[51:12.820 --> 51:17.380]  Take on that with the battery. I mean the pebbles obviously very different with the with the e-paper with the e-ink
[51:17.380 --> 51:22.500]  But what what might you have expected Apple to do any differently? I guess I don't know. I you know
[51:22.900 --> 51:23.700]  I
[51:23.700 --> 51:26.900]  Guess it's not in the digital crown is sort of their
[51:26.900 --> 51:35.140]  Distinguishing hardware characteristic, right? Absolutely, and I know that it sounds like a trivial little thing and I pointed this out on Twitter the other day
[51:36.340 --> 51:39.060]  and a whole bunch of like Android people were like
[51:40.180 --> 51:45.340]  Dude all the Android where phones have a crown look and there but they don't they have buttons they have a it looks
[51:45.340 --> 51:48.580]  You know, it's placed where it goes on a watch
[51:48.580 --> 51:51.700]  You know, it's over there in the same place where a dot you know a crown is on a watch
[51:52.020 --> 51:54.220]  But on all the Android where phones that I've seen to date
[51:54.220 --> 51:57.620]  It's just a button that you press to like wake it up or dismiss things or something
[51:57.620 --> 52:04.420]  What I mean that Apple you know has done that is original is the spinning crown and that it's a big part of the
[52:04.860 --> 52:06.860]  Interaction of using the device
[52:06.860 --> 52:11.100]  Well, I think they talked about it right that the you know the gesture on the iPad
[52:11.660 --> 52:19.980]  You know 10 years ago the the the spinning wheel was a big deal and then touch multi touch on the iPhone and now this is sort of the new gesture that
[52:19.980 --> 52:25.300]  You know is distinguishing and and potentially changes the way you're going to use this sort of thing
[52:25.300 --> 52:26.700]  Right that I think that yeah
[52:26.700 --> 52:29.700]  I think you're right though that in the video like I think Johnny I've you know
[52:30.140 --> 52:36.220]  They were not like putting words on his mouth. That's exactly what he said like that each one of those leaps forward came with one
[52:36.740 --> 52:42.580]  New thing like the Macintosh with the mouse pointer right you have a thing on your desk that you slider on your desk
[52:42.580 --> 52:44.580]  And it moves a pointer on your screen
[52:44.900 --> 52:47.060]  That's what the crown is to the Apple watch
[52:47.060 --> 52:50.900]  Yeah, so so when you did the when you got to try one on
[52:51.500 --> 52:55.820]  Did did you try one of the functional ones on or did you just have the I know they had like a demo?
[52:56.140 --> 53:02.260]  No, nobody that I know I've got to try on only Apple employees got had the functioning ones the ones that I got to try on
[53:02.500 --> 53:07.380]  We're all running the loop, but the loop included like when it
[53:08.980 --> 53:12.180]  Included things like getting a text message. So it's like
[53:12.180 --> 53:17.700]  You know, it wasn't like a movie was playing on the watch. It's like a series of
[53:18.740 --> 53:21.860]  Events yeah, you know, right, but it's still not
[53:22.260 --> 53:24.740]  So did you use the digital crown at all? I?
[53:25.620 --> 53:28.420]  Got to spin it, but I did not get to
[53:29.300 --> 53:35.220]  Use it in a meaningful way like it like when I spun it it didn't affect what was going on on the watch right?
[53:35.220 --> 53:41.740]  Yeah, so that's that's sort of what I was trying to get at is that I guess almost nobody besides Apple people has any experience with how this
[53:41.740 --> 53:46.460]  Interface actually works right? Oh, that reminds me. I have a bit of
[53:48.460 --> 53:51.580]  Follow-up from last week with I
[53:52.140 --> 53:56.220]  Had John mulch on the show, and I used the wrong word. I described it
[53:56.780 --> 54:03.140]  I described the feel of the digital crown as I used the word legubrious I
[54:03.140 --> 54:13.780]  I knew it was a really wonderful word that started with Al but Loubuebriess is a word that means looking or sounding sad and dismal
[54:15.940 --> 54:21.220]  It sounds like it means like liquid. Yeah, which is somehow why I
[54:21.860 --> 54:26.020]  Expemporaneously speaking it came to mind the word. I was looking for was
[54:26.660 --> 54:28.660]  lupriciousness
[54:28.660 --> 54:34.420]  As in lubricated. Yes lup. Okay lupricious is a word that means
[54:34.900 --> 54:42.260]  Well, the first sense of it is not what I mean the first sense means offensively displaying or intended to arouse sexual desire
[54:43.380 --> 54:50.660]  That is not what I meant. I meant definition two smooth and slippery with oil or a similar substance
[54:51.300 --> 54:57.220]  Okay, and there is it's simply the only word that I've encountered that describes the feel of
[54:57.220 --> 55:00.020]  Of the digital crown. It has a wonderful
[55:00.980 --> 55:03.620]  Wonderful almost magical lupriciousness to it
[55:04.740 --> 55:08.980]  All right, I'm telling you when this thing comes out and everybody gets to play with it
[55:08.980 --> 55:11.860]  I'm telling you this is how everybody is gonna say is oh my god
[55:11.860 --> 55:16.980]  I like to just sit there and spin that wheel it just has like this wonderful feel it feels amazing
[55:18.500 --> 55:25.620]  It does not feel like you're spinning on mechanical thing. It feels like you're like it somehow suspended in the world's like
[55:25.620 --> 55:32.020]  Best oil and that it's like not even touching anything mechanical and it just spins in the oil
[55:33.140 --> 55:37.060]  And it doesn't it doesn't spin it doesn't have a reach an end point, right? No
[55:37.300 --> 55:42.340]  It spins infinitely in both directions like a like a mouse pointer or a mouse wheel
[55:42.900 --> 55:46.740]  Like a scroll wheel. Yeah, right. Right. So if you were if if
[55:49.140 --> 55:52.660]  It's still and you know and people say to me like I say like even on the show last week
[55:52.660 --> 55:56.340]  I I'll emphasize I really I still have so many questions about apple
[55:56.340 --> 55:59.540]  Why I mean I'm kind of bummed that I'm not going to the event because I have so many questions, but
[56:00.740 --> 56:05.540]  You know, and there's so many other events where I go and I don't really have that many questions, you know
[56:05.540 --> 56:07.620]  I mean like right when there's a new iPhone. It's not
[56:08.260 --> 56:15.060]  Be terribly different from the old iPhone right like the or the better example would be the iPads last year
[56:15.540 --> 56:17.380]  Okay, because at least with the iPhones last year
[56:17.380 --> 56:21.300]  It's like well, am I gonna like a bigger phone? How you know the big phone was kind of a curiosity
[56:21.300 --> 56:25.860]  But with the iPads it was like same as last year, but now they have touch a D
[56:26.340 --> 56:29.540]  Okay, and I'm not saying I don't blame Apple. I'm not saying that was a bad event
[56:29.540 --> 56:31.540]  I'm saying that's somehow that's how progress happens
[56:31.540 --> 56:33.860]  I'm just saying if I had to miss that event
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.100]  I don't really feel like I was missing out on a chance to really learn anything
[56:38.100 --> 56:41.140]  I mean it was pretty easy to figure out, you know, remotely
[56:42.020 --> 56:47.060]  Whereas the watch I have so many questions so many questions and I don't I don't see how anybody couldn't
[56:47.540 --> 56:51.220]  You know be chock full of questions because though the one thing they've shown that you use the crown
[56:51.220 --> 56:53.940]  Four is zooming. So when you're on the home screen
[56:54.420 --> 56:57.380]  You can turn it one with spin it one way and the apps get smaller
[56:57.380 --> 57:01.620]  And you'll see more of them and you spin it the other way and you zoom in which makes them easier to tap
[57:02.580 --> 57:07.060]  And then the photos work the same way so you can zoom out and you see you know
[57:07.540 --> 57:10.340]  Thousands of two or hundreds I guess of tiny little thumbnails
[57:10.820 --> 57:12.820]  And then you can zoom in and make them bigger
[57:12.820 --> 57:18.340]  But are you gonna be able to use it to scroll or when you scroll is that you know like you use the touch screen?
[57:18.340 --> 57:19.940]  I
[57:19.940 --> 57:23.460]  Mean I can't imagine that you're gonna want to read long passages of text
[57:24.020 --> 57:28.340]  But you know it it still seems to me like that would work for scrolling too
[57:28.340 --> 57:32.020]  Because that it would for the same reason that they said that they didn't want to use touch for everything
[57:32.020 --> 57:36.020]  Which is that you're you know your big fat finger covers everything gets in the way. Yeah, right?
[57:37.940 --> 57:40.420]  I should took another break for sponsor
[57:40.420 --> 57:42.260]  But I'll just off the top of my head another thing
[57:42.260 --> 57:43.700]  I know I've mentioned this before
[57:43.700 --> 57:45.940]  But it's okay because everybody forgets all sorts of stuff
[57:45.940 --> 57:49.060]  But I keep getting questions on Twitter about whether they're gonna be left-handed
[57:50.100 --> 57:53.300]  Models of the watch and the answer is no
[57:53.940 --> 57:55.780]  You can just it's a setting
[57:56.500 --> 58:01.460]  It might even be right. Yeah, you just turn it upside down and because the straps come right off
[58:01.460 --> 58:04.100]  It's very easy. You'll just take the straps off put the
[58:04.900 --> 58:08.980]  You know top strap on the bottom bottom strap on the top and then when you put it on your wrist
[58:08.980 --> 58:13.380]  It like knows that oh your left-handed and it'll just turn the whole interface upside down
[58:13.380 --> 58:16.660]  And only is is it not even a setting that you need to adjust?
[58:17.540 --> 58:21.300]  I don't think so although I don't know because I asked
[58:22.420 --> 58:28.980]  It might be the sort of thing that if if you do it before you go through the first run it'll recognize it and no, okay
[58:30.260 --> 58:32.900]  But otherwise, you know, I think it's just a quick setting, you know
[58:33.380 --> 58:36.580]  Open up settings and you know tap a checkbox and
[58:37.540 --> 58:38.820]  It just turns upside down
[58:38.820 --> 58:44.820]  So the only difference you'll have is a left-handed user is that your crown will be underneath the button and
[58:45.540 --> 58:49.700]  So instead of the crown being above the button. It'll be below the button. That's the only difference
[58:50.020 --> 58:52.020]  Which does make it a little weird
[58:52.260 --> 58:56.260]  It still makes me you know, I'm still curious about the whole idea that it's not
[58:56.740 --> 58:59.940]  Center that the crown isn't centered because if the crown wore centered
[59:00.340 --> 59:05.140]  Which it is on a lot of watches then it would be it would be identical left-handed and right-handed
[59:05.140 --> 59:09.780]  I don't think it's a big difference though, and I also know I saw first-hand
[59:10.420 --> 59:12.820]  Walking around after the event. I saw Eddie Q
[59:14.020 --> 59:16.820]  Wearing his and he's left-handed and he had it on his right hand
[59:18.020 --> 59:19.220]  Upside down
[59:19.220 --> 59:26.100]  Well wait, but there's only one button right there's the crown on the button right, but the button is underneath the crew
[59:26.100 --> 59:30.900]  When you're wearing it on your left wrist the crown is at the top and yeah buttons underneath
[59:31.060 --> 59:33.060]  So if you turn it upside down
[59:33.060 --> 59:35.700]  The crown is on the bottom and the button is at the top
[59:36.180 --> 59:41.380]  Right, but even if even if the crown were centered the button would still oh yeah, the button would still yeah, that's flipped
[59:41.540 --> 59:43.540]  Yeah, exactly I'm in my
[59:44.180 --> 59:46.740]  You know, I wonder why they didn't do it this way world
[59:46.740 --> 59:50.980]  It would I guess it's sort of why didn't they put the button on one side and the crown on the other
[59:51.780 --> 59:56.180]  Having both in the center, but if you're gonna put one above the other it would definitely not be
[59:56.740 --> 59:58.740]  the same left-handed right-handed right
[59:58.740 --> 1:00:04.020]  Let me take a break here and thank our good friends at Casper
[1:00:04.820 --> 1:00:07.780]  C-A-S-P-E-R
[1:00:09.140 --> 1:00:15.460]  Casper this is the mattress people, right? These are the mattress people online retailer of premium mattresses
[1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:21.460]  For a fraction of the price the mattress industry has inherently forced cut consumers into paying
[1:00:22.020 --> 1:00:25.380]  notoriously high markups and they confuse the hell out of you
[1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:30.420]  You know you go into one mattress store and it's like the the the ceely posture p-dick
[1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:34.020]  XPC 2-7 you go to the next door
[1:00:34.020 --> 1:00:37.140]  They don't have that one they because they they from one store to another
[1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:39.940]  They sell the same mattress with a completely different name
[1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:46.660]  So that you can't do the sort of comparison shopping that any sane person would do when when you know buying something
[1:00:46.980 --> 1:00:48.980]  You know significant like a mattress
[1:00:49.540 --> 1:00:53.540]  To scam to cartel well Casper is busting it up
[1:00:53.540 --> 1:01:00.020]  Revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms and all that crap
[1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:03.620]  They just pass the savings directly to you the consumer
[1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:09.300]  Is it any good? Yes a Casper mattress provides resilience and long-lasting
[1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:16.820]  Supportive comfort Casper's mattress is one of a kind. It's a new hybrid mattress that combines premium latex foam
[1:01:17.380 --> 1:01:19.380]  With memory foam
[1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:23.300]  Now I've had one here. I've also been on one of those memory foam mattresses. I don't like it
[1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:26.500]  I feel like you get you get sunk in there like you're in the egg carton or something like that
[1:01:27.060 --> 1:01:29.060]  I don't want to get up from bed and have like a
[1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:32.900]  Crime scene outline on my body on the bed. This isn't like that at all
[1:01:32.900 --> 1:01:37.220]  It's like just enough of the memory-ish stuff that I'm surprised that there's any of it
[1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:40.740]  But they use a little bit of a rope, you know, that's what they call it, but it's not you know
[1:01:40.740 --> 1:01:42.740]  There's no like outline of your body in there
[1:01:42.980 --> 1:01:48.580]  We go to a retail store mattresses often cost well over 1500 bucks
[1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:50.580]  Uh, that's a that's a fact. I've
[1:01:51.300 --> 1:01:55.620]  Unbelievable how much mattresses like that's like one of those little things about getting in a real world where you have to
[1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.380]  Buy your own beds and like you said, it's two grand out of your pocket
[1:01:59.780 --> 1:02:03.700]  Or yeah, it's too grand to get a crane to put your refrigerator in your house
[1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:06.740]  And you're like you serious $2,000 Jesus
[1:02:07.300 --> 1:02:12.100]  Well Casper mattress has cost between 500 bucks for a twin-size mattress
[1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:18.820]  Uh, 600 for a twin-ax L. I didn't even know twin-ax L was a size 750 for full
[1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.460]  850 for Queen and only
[1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:28.180]  950 bucks for a king-size mattress 950 bucks for a top quality mattress
[1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:33.940]  Um, now they totally understand the whole idea of buying it's the same thing with the Warby Parker
[1:02:33.940 --> 1:02:35.940]  How you gonna buy glasses
[1:02:35.940 --> 1:02:41.860]  Without trying them on. Well, how you gonna buy a mattress without trying it out? Here's the thing. It's completely risk free
[1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:47.540]  They offer free delivery and free returns within a hundred day period
[1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:52.500]  So buy it it shows up at your house and it's as amazing
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:56.580]  It shows as you know. Well, how do they ship a mattress? Well, they because it they use the foam
[1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:58.180]  It because it's like this foam type thing
[1:02:58.180 --> 1:03:03.220]  They vacuum seal the thing up and it shows up in a box. It's like the size of like sandwich, right?
[1:03:03.220 --> 1:03:08.100]  Ah, no, it's like a little it's like a little it's all right like two sandwiches
[1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:12.340]  That's a little bit bigger than the sandwich, but it's surprisingly small
[1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.060]  It's probably about the same size as the box that your little dorm room
[1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:17.700]  Temporary fridge came in
[1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:20.740]  amazingly small for
[1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:22.820]  The queen-size mattress that I had them send
[1:03:23.460 --> 1:03:25.460]  Can't believe it, but it's like when they tell you
[1:03:25.460 --> 1:03:31.860]  To if you want to take some advice me when they tell you to put it in a room where you want it before you open it do do
[1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:39.220]  Do that as it explode out of the box, or does it just not explode, but it is very rapid
[1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:41.620]  The mattress wants to be big
[1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:45.940]  The mattress wants to expand to the size of a mattress
[1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:49.380]  But you have a hundred days no questions
[1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:53.540]  They you don't like have to call them up and and talk to like a hard sell
[1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:57.620]  A Comcast guy who's gonna be like trying to talk you in to keep in the mattress
[1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:01.380]  You don't like it if you just you just send it right back
[1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:06.100]  And you know, I guess getting an out of your house is gonna be a little bit harder in getting an in because it's already expanded
[1:04:06.100 --> 1:04:09.300]  But they they take care of it no questions ask no hassle
[1:04:09.300 --> 1:04:12.660]  There's no guy who's gonna you know give you a hard time about sending it back
[1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:14.900]  They'll take it back because they're so
[1:04:14.980 --> 1:04:17.860]  Confident that you're gonna like it and in fact
[1:04:18.420 --> 1:04:20.340]  I think I don't know I might be wrong here
[1:04:20.340 --> 1:04:25.060]  But I think that they've had such success that they actually like expand. I think that hundred day period is actually
[1:04:26.180 --> 1:04:29.220]  Longer than it used to be because they were so few people who sent it back
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:31.140]  um
[1:04:31.140 --> 1:04:38.420]  Where do you go to find out more go to Casper C.A.S.P. E.R. Casper sleep calm

[1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:21.380]  WWW do you do WWW?
[1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:29.460]  It does have the the it does have that. Yeah, well there we go good thing that Paul cathosas is here
[1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.580]  I check these ads for you check these ads
[1:05:32.900 --> 1:05:36.820]  Maybe what happened is that after I pitched about it the last time that they didn't have the though
[1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:43.340]  Then they added to the but then they got rid of the got rid of it. Good. Well, anyway, thank God Paul, you know
[1:05:44.740 --> 1:05:52.980]  Safety 50 bucks somebody. Yeah, anybody and some embarrassing 404s and and who knows you know what kind of horrible stuff would happen
[1:05:52.980 --> 1:05:58.940]  So anyway, it's Casper.com slash the talk show good for them for putting it on there. I paid good money for that
[1:05:58.940 --> 1:06:04.780]  Yeah, so anyway, we talked about pebble. We're talking about Apple watch
[1:06:06.860 --> 1:06:09.580]  We could get into pricing. I know I've written about this
[1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:14.420]  I don't I mean you've written about it and and that was interesting enough. I find it sort of
[1:06:15.180 --> 1:06:19.540]  We're gonna know in a week, right? All right, I do I know I that's the thing about doing this
[1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:25.380]  The show before an event is fun because it's like the one time where you can you can be completely wrong and just make stuff up
[1:06:25.380 --> 1:06:27.380]  and it's like anything could happen
[1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:32.500]  But then it's like, you know six days from now. Everything we said is either gonna be completely wrong and
[1:06:32.940 --> 1:06:37.100]  We look like idiots or even if we were right. It doesn't matter because everything else. Yeah
[1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:40.980]  I mean the the most interesting thing to me is
[1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:46.700]  Seeing just how big the range is and you know they said they've only told us one thing that it's
[1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:51.140]  349 for the very cheapest watch, right and that to me means I
[1:06:51.140 --> 1:06:57.980]  Figure there's like a slight chance. It's actually $2.99. What do you think? No, you don't think they come down from that? Nope
[1:06:58.220 --> 1:07:00.220]  Haven't they done that before I
[1:07:00.780 --> 1:07:05.820]  Think I feel like there was a product where they had pre-announced a price and then they dropped it 50 bucks I
[1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:12.820]  Mean it certainly is more possible than that they they raised the price, you know, right?
[1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:18.500]  Yeah, it's certainly not gonna be more than 349 to start right there's gonna be at least one model you can get for
[1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:21.860]  349 for sure. Um, I guess
[1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:29.580]  299's possible, but I don't know that just feels it feels to me like a side effect of the Tim Cook era of Apple is that
[1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:34.380]  They've they've really neatened up on things like that, you know like
[1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.700]  Like famously with the iPhone
[1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:45.220]  When they announced it at Macworld in January 2007 it had some kind of high
[1:07:45.220 --> 1:07:53.660]  Polymer plastic touch screen, right? And then it was like right in May like where they like first and then like now
[1:07:53.660 --> 1:07:56.380]  It's like final shipping dates and stuff and they said and by the way
[1:07:57.460 --> 1:08:04.020]  We've upgraded to display from plastic to this amazing glass from from, you know, what's that company?
[1:08:04.580 --> 1:08:11.580]  Corning and you know, and in stories that have come out in the years since it was clearly like
[1:08:11.580 --> 1:08:13.580]  Uh
[1:08:13.580 --> 1:08:17.220]  You know, you know that it was Steve who's like goddamn, you know, this is nicer
[1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:19.020]  So we're definitely doing it. We're not waiting a year
[1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:24.860]  We're getting it in here now and that it's like up to Tim Cook till like somehow make this happen where like and I think the story
[1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:28.380]  Was like they had to find a factory they had to like ramp the factory up to do it
[1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:32.460]  It wasn't as if this existed and was being made right it was like there was a whole it was crazy
[1:08:32.460 --> 1:08:38.980]  Right it was like nobody was really using it like corning an invented gorilla glass years before but nobody had really found a use for it
[1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:44.780]  And they just didn't you know, it was you know, they more or less needed them to like make more of it than they'd ever made before
[1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:48.120]  Right and by the way, it's got to happen in like the next four weeks
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:55.020]  So and so you're saying that I don't think stuff like that tighter. Yeah stuff like that doesn't happen anymore
[1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:56.660]  I don't think I don't you know
[1:08:56.660 --> 1:08:58.740]  I think part of it is that jobs was clearly
[1:08:58.980 --> 1:09:04.740]  Impetuous and I don't think anybody would describe Tim Cook as impetuous and you know, I just think that you know
[1:09:04.740 --> 1:09:06.740]  It's just a little bit more orderly
[1:09:06.740 --> 1:09:12.340]  Okay, I feel like I feel like as of September Tim Cook knew that they could sell this entry thing for 3.49 and
[1:09:12.900 --> 1:09:17.500]  You know marketing wise whatever you know, however they decided that that looks good as the entry level price
[1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:21.060]  I just don't see how that would change. Okay, so we're starting at 3.49
[1:09:22.020 --> 1:09:27.300]  Yeah, so to me the only I don't care if it's you know exactly 9.99 or 12.99
[1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:31.220]  Whatever, but I think the the interesting thing to me is just the three price points of
[1:09:31.940 --> 1:09:36.700]  You know the entry level and then just the straight-up Apple watch and the addition which I think
[1:09:36.700 --> 1:09:38.380]  Is I hate that
[1:09:38.380 --> 1:09:42.820]  That suffix as a to try and mean a whole other thing that
[1:09:43.300 --> 1:09:51.420]  The more I write about it the harder the it is it's never ceases being a mouthful to people watch addition
[1:09:51.420 --> 1:09:53.980]  Right because you I keep wanting to use additions
[1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:56.620]  To mean what they call
[1:09:57.020 --> 1:10:03.180]  Collections right yeah, that's that's just the word addition means or often means, you know a group of something
[1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:09.980]  Right, and so I find it very awkward for that to be a model, but whatever and combined with the fact and I've still
[1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:11.260]  To this date
[1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:16.740]  It's still not gotten used to the fact that the mid-price or mid-level of the steel one is just called Apple watch
[1:10:16.740 --> 1:10:24.220]  I really wish that it was the app, you know the basic Apple watch sport Apple watch steel Apple watch addition
[1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:28.540]  I don't call it something, you know, I'll give it give that one give that one some sort of
[1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:33.340]  suffixes what they all have a name right right there'd be like sport steel and addition
[1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:38.060]  You know, I kind of see why they didn't I'm not even sick because I can't think of a good name
[1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:41.180]  I don't think steel is a great name. I think you know, it's
[1:10:42.940 --> 1:10:48.180]  You know, I don't know. It's not great sounds heavy. Yeah, it's maybe sounds a little masculine
[1:10:48.780 --> 1:10:51.020]  Right, oh definitely. Yeah, you know
[1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:57.780]  So I know you know, I don't know and regular regular sounds stupid to you know, it's just called Apple watch
[1:10:57.780 --> 1:11:04.060]  But it's still it makes it very hard to write about because sometimes when you say Apple watch you mean all of them
[1:11:04.060 --> 1:11:08.180]  You know, like your app right your app just runs on Apple watch and it doesn't matter which one you bought
[1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:13.700]  But when you're shopping if you just buy an Apple watch you're buying a very specific model
[1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:16.300]  You know, you're buying the stainless steel one
[1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:22.940]  Very confusing perhaps worrisome. I don't know. Maybe it's a little worrisome that it's that that they've you know
[1:11:22.940 --> 1:11:26.980]  They're coming out with something that seems so can sometimes so hard to talk about
[1:11:26.980 --> 1:11:30.740]  Well, it's interesting because you would before we did this before we started the show
[1:11:30.740 --> 1:11:34.740]  You sent me this image that somebody made and it was based on pricing predictions. You would made
[1:11:35.300 --> 1:11:37.300]  Yeah, they made this whole
[1:11:37.620 --> 1:11:42.740]  Image and it was just you know, here's all the prices and I guess you said that got circulated as if this was a real leak right
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:45.700]  I'm I'll put it. I will absolutely positively Dave
[1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:48.340]  Make sure I put this in the show notes. Um
[1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:50.980]  I've already got a link in my my
[1:11:50.980 --> 1:11:56.660]  Show notes as we go. It's a guy. Oh god. Why can't anybody on a forum give themselves a real name?
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:12:04.420]  Pigeur one is a Mac rumors forum member and last week he posted this image
[1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:08.980]  Um, and he is what he wrote. He's very honest. He's straightforward about it
[1:12:08.980 --> 1:12:10.900]  He wrote I made this speculative
[1:12:11.460 --> 1:12:15.140]  priceless based in large part on Gruber's speculation
[1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:22.660]  colon and then here's the image that he made but he he's using Apple per photography of the watches and
[1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:28.900]  He's set the names in the you know, San Francisco font and he's got the prices in
[1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:36.580]  Helvetica so it's vaguely styled or roughly styled in the format of Apple's marketing materials
[1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:42.020]  I could tell by looking at it right away that it's not official. It's there's little subtle things that are off about the
[1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:45.380]  The fonts but it's close enough that
[1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:50.420]  95% of people could easily be convinced that this is from Apple
[1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:55.780]  Right and so then it got circulated as if this had leaked out of Apple right because it's all one big image
[1:12:55.860 --> 1:12:57.940]  And of course it hit Twitter and people stop
[1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:02.500]  You know immediately especially when the source is something like a forum post at Mac rumors
[1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:05.300]  and it like spun out of control
[1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:06.900]  Like
[1:13:06.900 --> 1:13:10.180]  Incredibly fast like within 24 hours over the last weekend
[1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:12.180]  It went from
[1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:16.100]  Did you see that there was a guy who posted a thing in the the Mac rumors forum to
[1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:24.420]  Like the poor kid some poor kid at I download blog like by the next day had written these are the Apple watch prices
[1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:28.580]  And then had to retract it. Yeah, I did retract it with the
[1:13:29.300 --> 1:13:32.100]  Horribly confused very contrived about it, but you know
[1:13:33.140 --> 1:13:38.260]  Well, this was interesting about the whole thing. I still get if you look at my Twitter stream by the way right now as we speak
[1:13:38.260 --> 1:13:43.620]  There's if you won't have to go more than 20 or 30 before you'll find somebody asking me what I think about this leaked
[1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:46.340]  priceless
[1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:48.340]  Which is based on your own predictions
[1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:52.340]  Right from like two weeks earlier. Right, but it's actually not
[1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:54.660]  I actually think that these prices are off
[1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:58.260]  There's some things that I think he he probably got right and he was very thoughtful about
[1:13:58.340 --> 1:14:01.780]  But I think once he gets past Apple watch sport
[1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:04.420]  He's vastly underestimating the price of these things
[1:14:04.420 --> 1:14:10.580]  Well, what I thought was interesting about it was just how clunky the image was and it shows
[1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:15.140]  Yeah, I have to pull the thing up, but it shows there's like 18 rows aren't there
[1:14:16.100 --> 1:14:21.540]  At least right right and it's it's showing you know, here's the intro sport
[1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:25.060]  Here's the steel sport. Here's the main Apple watch
[1:14:25.620 --> 1:14:30.340]  Here's the Apple watch in space gray or whatever and he's got 12 pricing tiers
[1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:33.060]  Okay, and each one
[1:14:33.060 --> 1:14:35.540]  In two sizes 38 and 42
[1:14:36.580 --> 1:14:41.780]  We mentioned earlier in the show. I think that actually makes sense that I don't know about it at the sport level
[1:14:41.780 --> 1:14:43.460]  I could see like maybe it's sport
[1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:46.260]  They're both just 349 and you just pick the size you want
[1:14:46.260 --> 1:14:48.260]  But then I think once you go to steel and gold
[1:14:48.420 --> 1:14:51.060]  They're they're probably will be a small difference in price
[1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:53.380]  Right
[1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:56.980]  But it was interesting just because of how clunky it actually is and you know
[1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:59.060]  We were talking about how clunky it is to talk about the different
[1:14:59.060 --> 1:15:01.060]  collections
[1:15:01.940 --> 1:15:06.420]  And I think it's I don't know it'll be interesting to see just how this plays out because
[1:15:06.900 --> 1:15:09.380]  Apple has not really ever had anything at least not recently
[1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.860]  That was this complex or this complicated
[1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:16.420]  It is like buying a watch. I mean like when you go and buy, you know
[1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:22.100]  Watch at a jewelry store, you know, you can't just say I want a you know Rolex explorer
[1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:26.260]  And well, I guess Rolex explorer is actually one where there is just one
[1:15:26.260 --> 1:15:33.620]  That's a bad example. Right, but you know like a Rolex a mariner has all sorts of color choices
[1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:36.020]  Just on the dial. There's blue dial. There's green dial
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:42.820]  The black dial is the traditional one steel steel with gold all golds, you know, etc, etc
[1:15:43.460 --> 1:15:47.700]  And that there's you know all sorts of matrices like that within
[1:15:48.260 --> 1:15:51.540]  The line of all the major watch brands where you know
[1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:56.820]  Certain watches come in all sorts of different you know dial colors and band colors and stuff like that
[1:15:56.820 --> 1:16:01.620]  But it's absolutely nothing like any Apple product before right and and you know
[1:16:02.420 --> 1:16:05.220]  Apple used to have these terrible matrices of products
[1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:09.140]  You know the ten different models of performer back in the early 90s and so on
[1:16:09.540 --> 1:16:12.340]  And then I think it's in my mind
[1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:17.220]  It's sort of burned in where Steve Jobs would have a grid and there were just before items
[1:16:17.220 --> 1:16:22.580]  Right, right, and it's you know, good better best and and I don't know. I guess there's that's only three items, but
[1:16:23.540 --> 1:16:25.540]  Well, famously the I
[1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:30.580]  It's to me it was like a moment where I remember thinking like I think that this guy is going to do it
[1:16:30.580 --> 1:16:35.300]  I think he's going to turn the company around is that that four-way matrix for
[1:16:36.340 --> 1:16:40.180]  It was laptop laptops yeah pro consumer
[1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:45.540]  And so that's it. So it's the iBook. It's the power book. It's the iMac. It's the power Mac, right? Yeah
[1:16:45.540 --> 1:16:50.100]  Yeah, that's that's really the one I'm thinking. Yeah, and it was brilliant and it in hindsight
[1:16:50.100 --> 1:16:52.900]  I think it's so easy to underestimate the brilliance of that decision
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:59.620]  But it it cut all sorts, you know cutting products out of a company is always painful politically unless you're somebody like jobs
[1:16:59.620 --> 1:17:04.900]  Which just doesn't give a shit about the politics screw you if your job was running the performance 700 line
[1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:07.940]  You know, you know get with the program
[1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:13.140]  And none of the no other computer company had a had a lineup like that
[1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:17.220]  Right, I mean even to this day if you go to like del.com and try to configure a
[1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:24.100]  It's a nightmare trying to you it's hard to even figure out like even if you just know I want like the the maxed out
[1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:27.140]  You know, I want the best laptop I can get it's like hard to figure it out
[1:17:28.660 --> 1:17:31.460]  All right, it's this is nothing like that and again
[1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:36.020]  That's not to say that if Steve Jobs were still around they wouldn't be doing this who knows, you know
[1:17:36.020 --> 1:17:40.220]  Maybe you know he and Johnny I've mapped out these watches, you know five years ago
[1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:44.140]  And you know he'd be right on board watches are different, you know, there's no, you know
[1:17:44.940 --> 1:17:46.940]  You can't sell watches like yourself
[1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:49.900]  PCs and laptops
[1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:54.380]  Well, are you well, they're not they're not willing to try at least right now
[1:17:54.380 --> 1:17:59.740]  Or they're they're looking to try doing it the way you normally sell a watch as opposed to the way that they sell phones and computers
[1:17:59.740 --> 1:18:00.780]  Yeah, no, I guess you're right
[1:18:00.780 --> 1:18:05.980]  I shouldn't say you can't I should say it doesn't it Apple apparently doesn't think that they can or they should
[1:18:05.980 --> 1:18:10.940]  Well, and so the interesting thing to me is I was in an Apple store. What about a week ago?
[1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:13.100]  and
[1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:17.100]  They haven't shown how the stores are going to change but they're clearly going to have to change
[1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:23.100]  And I think that's something that everyone will see in the near future and that to me is is more interesting than
[1:18:23.340 --> 1:18:29.100]  Spekulating on the prices, you know, you've been in a store recently, right? Yeah a couple times. Yeah. What are they going to do?
[1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:30.620]  I don't know
[1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:35.660]  I mean and they even said in the New Yorker story on Johnny I that big one profile
[1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:42.700]  They even mentioned that one of the things he's got going on is that he's leading a redesign of the store it sounds to me like from
[1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:46.140]  It was sort of an offhand remark and you know
[1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:50.140]  The article was so long that it's easy to just throw something off, but it
[1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:55.100]  It seems like a huge undertaking that they're going to redesign all of the stores, you know
[1:18:55.100 --> 1:18:57.100]  He's working hand in hand with Angela aren't on that
[1:18:57.660 --> 1:18:59.660]  Right
[1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:01.660]  Partly for the watch for sure
[1:19:01.660 --> 1:19:06.700]  I'm I'm guessing partly just to build for the future because who knows what they're going to do next, you know
[1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:09.740]  But I have no idea what they're going to do
[1:19:09.740 --> 1:19:14.300]  I'm my best guess at this point is that there's nowhere near enough time for them to renovate
[1:19:14.540 --> 1:19:19.340]  Even if it's not a total redesign of every store even if it's some kind of we're going to renovate the
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:23.340]  Where the genius bar used to be or something, you know, we're going to get rid of all the
[1:19:24.540 --> 1:19:28.220]  You know take this take the spot in the stores where they used to sell gift cards
[1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:33.740]  And I guess if you want to gift card now you just talk to somebody and we'll use that space to sell the watches
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:40.540]  I don't think the I don't think the vast majority of stores are going to have the addition models
[1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:43.100]  I think that at least to start out my best
[1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:46.860]  This is my bet because I just don't think there's enough time like it's already March 2nd
[1:19:47.340 --> 1:19:49.340]  If they don't ship until
[1:19:49.340 --> 1:19:51.180]  April 30 which would be the
[1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:56.380]  And I don't think that's given that the event is on March 9th. I'm kind of thinking they're going to ship an early April
[1:19:56.380 --> 1:20:01.900]  Right, um, but you know the the longest period of time they have between like seven weeks
[1:20:01.900 --> 1:20:05.820]  Right, and there's no way that they could do that across however many hundred stores they have
[1:20:06.220 --> 1:20:09.100]  So do you think I think it's like three or four hundred stores now? Yeah, so do you think
[1:20:09.980 --> 1:20:13.660]  The addition models will be something that you go to New York City or LA or
[1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:16.540]  You know could be to start and certainly San Francisco
[1:20:17.180 --> 1:20:21.980]  Right, right, you know, there's whatever wherever they get in major cities. Yeah, well
[1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:25.420]  And maybe that's all the stores that are like landmarks
[1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:31.660]  Okay, you know, there's I don't know what I don't quite think that they have like a tier of those stores
[1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:33.500]  You know like a name for it, but they're you know
[1:20:34.380 --> 1:20:37.340]  The ones like in London that Tim Cook was just at this week
[1:20:37.420 --> 1:20:43.740]  You know the ones that look architecturally interesting in it and that are physically bigger that they'll have you know a separate little
[1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:48.860]  A salon, you know where you'll buy the addition models
[1:20:49.420 --> 1:20:54.300]  I think I you know, and I think they could they could even start and just say it's only in three cities to start in New York
[1:20:54.300 --> 1:20:57.340]  You know Los Angeles and San Francisco
[1:20:58.300 --> 1:21:00.700]  And then they'll slowly roll that out over time
[1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:04.700]  Right, yeah, I don't know. It's the the to me
[1:21:04.700 --> 1:21:07.580]  That's that's a very interesting aspect of it that you know
[1:21:07.580 --> 1:21:10.540]  And not a lot of people will consider and then maybe it doesn't really matter that much
[1:21:10.540 --> 1:21:16.940]  But this is it's not it's not changing the company the way that the iPad changed the company because that was or it's changing
[1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:21.900]  It much more than the iPad or even the iPhone changed the company because those are still computing devices
[1:21:21.900 --> 1:21:27.660]  That are sold the way computing devices are sold and the watch clearly is not going to be sold that way
[1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:33.900]  Right, and it's there's so many different ways where it's like you can't have it both ways like if you're going to say
[1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:39.020]  We're going and I just I really do believe that this is true that these are $10,000 watches
[1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:43.980]  Maybe you know if and again if I'm right that they sell a gold link band
[1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:46.460]  $20,000 watches
[1:21:46.460 --> 1:21:54.620]  And that's totally reasonable given the price of fine watches and solid gold bracelets in the market today
[1:21:56.300 --> 1:22:01.740]  But you can't have those things being sold by kids wearing jeans and t-shirts
[1:22:03.100 --> 1:22:07.420]  All right, who like their next the next thing that they're doing is
[1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:11.420]  Scanning somebody's hello kitty iPhone case
[1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:13.420]  All right
[1:22:14.780 --> 1:22:19.420]  Yeah, what can I help you in I'm buying a hello kitty iPhone case. Oh, okay. Thank you. Here you go
[1:22:19.420 --> 1:22:24.380]  Do you want to receipt? Nope. All right. I'm buying a $15,000 watch. Okay. Here you go
[1:22:25.180 --> 1:22:29.500]  Like well, I won't said last week. Do you think they're going to let you do the the walk-out and pay on your
[1:22:31.340 --> 1:22:34.380]  Just walk out the door. You would imagine how hard you'd get
[1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:41.020]  Tackles I know walk out of the store with the self-paid $15,000
[1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:45.420]  Like they're just gonna have them on the shelf just in a little little case
[1:22:46.140 --> 1:22:48.460]  Grab it in your flash your receipt and you're good to go
[1:22:48.940 --> 1:22:51.340]  No, I don't know. I'm having so much fun
[1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:57.420]  With this watch thing and again, it's not even because I know I want one and I can't wait to get it because I don't even know
[1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:58.620]  I'm so
[1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:00.940]  So many questions about what I would find useful with it
[1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:06.540]  I just find it useful like as somebody who's professionally paid to write about the company that there's so many things
[1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:10.620]  We don't know and it just and they're don't seem to be good answers for it
[1:23:11.340 --> 1:23:16.700]  There just does not seem to be a good answer for how do you sell a $10,000 gold watch in the Apple store as we know
[1:23:18.220 --> 1:23:19.260]  Um
[1:23:19.420 --> 1:23:23.820]  Like I said the multi-class week. I know in the Philly store. We have an upstairs. That's not retail
[1:23:23.820 --> 1:23:27.820]  You can't wander up there. It's like the business center and they have classes and stuff like that
[1:23:27.820 --> 1:23:34.860]  And I could see them apportioning, you know like like if you go into buy the addition you would be taking up there
[1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:38.700]  But even then even if if like you get escorted to a quiet
[1:23:39.660 --> 1:23:47.740]  Salon type experience and get you know a concierge level of of sales get some cucumber water. Yeah cucumber water and you know
[1:23:47.740 --> 1:23:49.740]  Maybe a glass of bubbly
[1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:53.580]  And you get to try these watches on while sitting, you know or whatever
[1:23:53.580 --> 1:23:57.820]  I still don't see how you go from the front of the store to where you tell somebody
[1:23:58.780 --> 1:24:05.340]  You know, that's what you're here for right? Like at some you know, like that's like it my big irritation with Apple stores in general is that
[1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:10.460]  It's sometimes it's so hard to get somebody's attention like if you know exactly what you want to get right
[1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:13.580]  You know like
[1:24:13.580 --> 1:24:15.580]  We got Jonas a
[1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:18.300]  Macbook for Christmas
[1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:25.420]  And I knew exactly what I wanted to get and it's like you know what didn't take too long and you know
[1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:29.100]  I have to say you know given that it was the holiday season and everything it didn't take too long
[1:24:29.340 --> 1:24:33.740]  But it seemed to take a little bit too long given that I knew exactly what I wanted when I stepped foot into the store
[1:24:34.620 --> 1:24:37.740]  Right. Yeah, yeah, and and now they're adding a whole
[1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:45.180]  Separate section most likely right like if you walk into a Tiffany to buy some fine jewelry, you know
[1:24:45.180 --> 1:24:49.020]  There's no there aren't any there's no loud crowds. You know
[1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:53.580]  You don't kids sitting on round balls playing bugs life or I'm right
[1:24:54.140 --> 1:24:55.180]  It's
[1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:56.860]  You know and who knows you know
[1:24:57.420 --> 1:24:59.420]  Maybe if it's like the Christmas or whatever
[1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:03.980]  Maybe you might have to wait before a sales person will will come greet you
[1:25:03.980 --> 1:25:10.620]  But once the first sales person who greets you is going to be able to handle your request whether it's for a hundred and fifty
[1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:15.340]  dollar pendant or whether it's for a fifteen thousand dollar pendant, right?
[1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:21.340]  It's like whatever it is that you're there to buy a Tiffany that your sales rep is going to make you feel you know comfortable and
[1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:24.060]  You know like you're in the right place
[1:25:25.260 --> 1:25:27.260]  I just don't get it with that with the
[1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:34.060]  I think the more I think I wrote about this last week. I the more I look at the bands the more I think that there's going to be
[1:25:35.260 --> 1:25:38.140]  Wide variation and pricing based on the band
[1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:43.340]  I'm convinced of it and I think it's sort of how they fill in the gaps like if you're looking
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:45.740]  I think if you're looking and I just hi from months
[1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:48.060]  I just was thinking well three main price points, you know
[1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:50.140]  349 for support
[1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:53.660]  Something maybe a thousand for the steel and five thousand for colder
[1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:55.660]  But I think that within each
[1:25:56.140 --> 1:26:01.500]  Collection I'm making sure I use the right word within each collection. There's going to be I think a
[1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:08.540]  Not startlingly big but a very wide variety like I could see this just based on the bands
[1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:12.860]  Yeah, I could see the steel one like starting at like seven hundred dollars
[1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:20.380]  With the rubber band. What do they call it? Polly you you're a theme. What's the famous their fancy word for rubber band rubber?
[1:26:22.460 --> 1:26:24.460]  Floro elastomer
[1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:28.780]  I would not have come up with that
[1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:31.420]  Black Floro elastomer um
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:36.220]  So I could see that starting at let's say seven hundred which would be double the price of the sport watch
[1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:41.500]  Which to me is like a reasonable like increment to go from aluminum to steel you double it
[1:26:42.220 --> 1:26:44.220]  um
[1:26:44.220 --> 1:26:48.380]  But then I would think like the ones with the leather bands would be a couple hundred bucks more than that
[1:26:48.380 --> 1:26:53.820]  And I could see like the the metal link band one being like fifteen hundred dollars or even two thousand dollars
[1:26:54.220 --> 1:26:56.220]  And I know everybody else is like
[1:26:56.220 --> 1:26:59.740]  Nobody else is thinking that for this deal one, but I I could see them doing it
[1:27:01.100 --> 1:27:06.700]  I read I just reread it before we started the show on on apple watch is page you go to apple.com
[1:27:06.940 --> 1:27:11.660]  slash watch slash apple dash watch now. This is probably going to change
[1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:16.540]  Next week, so you know go check it out before you know. I'm guessing the website will be redone
[1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:21.420]  After it's released, but if here's their description for the link bracelet
[1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:24.700]  This is for the steel watch. This isn't for the edition. This is for
[1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:27.180]  The steel watch crafted from the same
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:33.420]  316 L stainless steel alloy is the case the link bracelet has more than 100 components
[1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:40.060]  The machining process is so precise. It takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band
[1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:44.060]  In part, that's because they aren't simply a uniform size
[1:27:44.220 --> 1:27:47.180]  But subtly increase in width as they approach the case
[1:27:47.820 --> 1:27:51.180]  Once assembled the links are brushed by hand
[1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:55.180]  To ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:28:01.820]  The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet and several links feature a simple release button
[1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:07.340]  So you can add and remove links without any special tools available in stainless steel and black stainless steel
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:09.980]  If it takes nine hours for that
[1:28:10.540 --> 1:28:18.220]  One and then after it's assembled. It's polished by hand that that's not going to be like $150 extra
[1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:24.780]  Like I seriously I'm not exaggerating like that that might be like a $1,500 bracelet
[1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:30.140]  Like it might mean that the you know the watch that comes with that bracelet is is $2,000
[1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:34.220]  I mean reading that description. It certainly sounds
[1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:38.700]  More much more expensive than I think what people are anticipating. Yeah, right
[1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:41.900]  It's like at first like the way they showed it at the event in September
[1:28:41.900 --> 1:28:44.540]  It's like you can get a bracelet that matches your taste
[1:28:44.540 --> 1:28:49.020]  You know, maybe you're you know, maybe and I like I have I've had over the years
[1:28:49.020 --> 1:28:51.980]  I've had many watches with like a rubber plastic strap
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:53.500]  I find them to be very comfortable
[1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:57.820]  I think you know, I always feel like you can get them nice and tight and then they have a little bit of give
[1:28:57.980 --> 1:28:59.820]  I think that the
[1:28:59.820 --> 1:29:01.820]  Floro elastomer band is going to be great
[1:29:03.580 --> 1:29:08.700]  But they made it seem as though it's like pick the one that matches your style and you know, maybe you know, I think everybody thought
[1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:11.420]  Well, maybe this the link bracelet will cost a little bit more
[1:29:11.420 --> 1:29:15.980]  But I if you think about it if you just start with the assumption that it's going to cost a lot more
[1:29:16.460 --> 1:29:18.460]  That description makes a lot more sense
[1:29:19.580 --> 1:29:21.580]  Nine hours to cut the winxes for what
[1:29:23.580 --> 1:29:28.300]  Well, I'll tell you what they're saying, you know, that's because they chained with slightly
[1:29:28.940 --> 1:29:30.940]  Maybe they could have just made them the same with
[1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:36.700]  Well, or you could have cut in about four hours. Well, why couldn't you have one machine that cuts the first link one machine? You know
[1:29:37.260 --> 1:29:39.260]  Right, right
[1:29:39.260 --> 1:29:43.580]  It actually it seems kind of crazy that it takes nine hours, you know, but
[1:29:44.460 --> 1:29:45.820]  I mean, I've no reason to doubt them
[1:29:45.820 --> 1:29:49.580]  But there certainly seem to be setting it up. It that to me sounds like the description of a
[1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:54.220]  $1,500 bracelet of an expensive piece of of watch band. Yeah
[1:29:56.220 --> 1:30:00.860]  And I think that's the thing that's so interesting to me is that all of these watches are the same
[1:30:01.420 --> 1:30:07.180]  Right, like the gold whatever it costs whether it's only 1500 bucks or whether it's 15,000 bucks
[1:30:07.180 --> 1:30:12.380]  It's still the exact same device as the watch that you're going to get for 349 bucks
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:16.140]  And that's nuts
[1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:18.940]  Well, but there is precedent for that in the
[1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:20.860]  The
[1:30:20.860 --> 1:30:26.940]  Some precedent not scaling all the way down to 349, but that's you know, like if you buy a Rolex
[1:30:27.100 --> 1:30:32.620]  Submariner and stainless steel in the fashion world. There's huge precedent, right? Right or yeah
[1:30:32.620 --> 1:30:38.460]  Or like handbags, right that they're you know, there might be two Louis Vuitton bags, but one is made out of
[1:30:39.420 --> 1:30:41.420]  You know, I don't know some kind of
[1:30:41.980 --> 1:30:46.460]  Special rare leather and the other one is right out of the regular leather and it's you know
[1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:51.340]  $5,000 difference and it's the exact same bag same dimension same pocket same zippers
[1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:57.580]  Everything's the same except one is made out of a different kind of leather and it costs $5,000 more, you know
[1:30:58.380 --> 1:31:00.380]  But in terms of technology
[1:31:00.380 --> 1:31:07.940]  What has besides besides the outlier like what's the virtue is the one that makes a case for your phone that makes it worth like
[1:31:07.940 --> 1:31:12.300]  No, not a case. It is a phone. It's it's a whole phone, right? Right? But it's well
[1:31:12.300 --> 1:31:14.300]  But the value in it is all in the case, right?
[1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:19.660]  The case of the phone the the casing the most and I were talking about this last week. They also offer a
[1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:27.620]  Concierge service where there's like a special button on the phone and then it you just hit this button and then you get like a virtue
[1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:32.340]  Person who will be like what do you want on star for your phone? Yeah, yeah, and you're like I want to you know
[1:31:32.340 --> 1:31:34.340]  I want to go to an Italian restaurant tonight
[1:31:34.420 --> 1:31:39.300]  Well, but I mean besides these outliers in terms of selling technology
[1:31:40.020 --> 1:31:42.500]  I don't think there's ever been anything like this. No
[1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:47.380]  No, you cannot think of it as a technology product. You really it doesn't make any sense right
[1:31:48.420 --> 1:31:51.220]  Well, but I think I think that's completely true
[1:31:51.220 --> 1:31:55.540]  But I think the $349 one as a technology product is very interesting. Yeah
[1:31:55.540 --> 1:32:02.100]  So it's it's almost like they're selling you know an Apple watch for three hundred forty nine bucks or Apple watch sport
[1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:05.460]  Whatever and then they're also entering the fashion world with this
[1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:08.580]  You know all these bands and all these different cases and
[1:32:09.460 --> 1:32:13.940]  And it's it's two completely different markets. Yeah, absolutely
[1:32:15.300 --> 1:32:17.300]  It's it also
[1:32:17.300 --> 1:32:24.100]  I remember the day of the event the very day of the event back in September. I met Michael Lop
[1:32:25.620 --> 1:32:30.100]  In San Francisco, you know like after he got out of work of five and
[1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:38.180]  We got a drink and then like the first thing he said and I thought it was so stupid is that it it seems as though they're launching this product
[1:32:39.140 --> 1:32:40.820]  Three years in
[1:32:41.060 --> 1:32:44.980]  You know that the waffle way to do it would have been the first one. Here's the here's Apple watch
[1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:50.900]  It's one size one color one style as a white band. Here's what it does and in the next year
[1:32:51.540 --> 1:32:53.540]  They fix it and make it better
[1:32:53.700 --> 1:32:57.940]  Whatever and then maybe in the third year. They say okay, this has been great. It's been a great success
[1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:02.820]  Now you can get it in steel you can get it in gold, etc. It's you know, and here's all these other leather bands
[1:33:04.420 --> 1:33:09.780]  Right, this is fully formed in terms of they didn't just make the watch and they didn't just make the watch in three different cases
[1:33:09.780 --> 1:33:14.820]  They made all these bands and they've they've done every they've they've really fine-tuned
[1:33:14.820 --> 1:33:19.540]  Every aspect of it. Yeah, definitely and I think I think that they're going to cover a
[1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:23.860]  Incredible gamut of price points. I think that you know and I think you know
[1:33:23.860 --> 1:33:25.140]  I think 90
[1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:27.060]  90 some percent. This is another thing
[1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:33.060]  We did the Wall Street Journal had this goofy story two weeks ago about some sources and this supply chain
[1:33:33.060 --> 1:33:37.540]  It said that they expect to sell like 50% sport and 33%
[1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:46.100]  Steal and 16% gold. That's that's crazy. I the more I think about the more I think that whoever told them that was just you know
[1:33:46.100 --> 1:33:48.980]  I guess screw it with them. Yeah, just totally screwing with them
[1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:53.900]  Because there is no way unless it's possible that I'm completely wrong
[1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:59.820]  Could be that I'm completely wrong and the gold one is only going to cost I don't know $1,500 or something
[1:34:00.180 --> 1:34:03.940]  That's you know far more you know in line with the
[1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:10.340]  3.49 price if I'm right though that it's even if I'm only right that it's 5,000 let alone 10,000 to start
[1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:16.180]  There's no way that 16% of the ones they sell. They're not going to sell a million of those a month. That's right
[1:34:16.660 --> 1:34:18.100]  Crazy town
[1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:22.900]  Right, I mean like Rolex only sells. I mean Rolex is a very secretive company
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:27.540]  But best that anybody can tell is the Rolex sells somewhere around 600,000
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:32.900]  Watches a year. There's some weird thing where they do they they have to submit them to a
[1:34:32.900 --> 1:34:40.900]  The Swiss some Swiss government agency that's officially for logical society. Yeah, it's like it's called C O S C
[1:34:41.220 --> 1:34:45.620]  Certification. I don't know. I could it that maybe one of those seasons already a certification
[1:34:45.620 --> 1:34:50.420]  But it officially certifies it as a chronometer that the government agency does certain testing
[1:34:50.580 --> 1:34:55.940]  That's probably less rigorous than what Rolex themselves is but it lets them say it's an officially certified chronometer
[1:34:55.940 --> 1:35:01.220]  And that because it's like a government thing the numbers come out and it's something like Rolex certifies
[1:35:01.220 --> 1:35:05.220]  800,000 watches a year or at least they did in 2012
[1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:11.860]  But that they might only sell 600,000 of them. I guess you don't get the watch certified you get the movement certified the
[1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:18.420]  Okay, you know some of those might be for repairs or who knows but they're such they're they're almost Apple like in their secrecy
[1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:23.380]  And that you know, maybe it's just purposeful mis misdirection. Yeah, but it could be that they're you know
[1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:25.780]  Extras for repairs or whatever
[1:35:25.780 --> 1:35:30.660]  Um, but at the very least though long long way of saying that's just a baseline for what?
[1:35:31.540 --> 1:35:36.420]  You know the world's premier luxury watchmaker sells in a year 600 miles. It's almost a ceiling
[1:35:36.420 --> 1:35:42.340]  I mean not that Apple can't sell more or but it's it's a likely ceiling right and a lot of Rolex's watches
[1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:45.620]  Do not cost more than $10,000. I'm taming a lot of them do
[1:35:45.620 --> 1:35:52.020]  But I think by volume you know a lot of them sell less so if the addition starts at $10,000 which I really do think it does
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:57.460]  The idea that they would sell a million of them a quarter in the first year
[1:35:57.860 --> 1:36:04.580]  It just just does not compute. I mean, and this is I think I don't the anybody would accuse me of being a
[1:36:05.380 --> 1:36:10.820]  pessimist on Apple, you know future Apple product success, you know possibilities
[1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:13.860]  But I'm just saying that in terms of you know just
[1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:20.580]  How the world seems to what work in terms of people who spend that kind of money on jewelry? It just seems out of scale
[1:36:20.580 --> 1:36:25.460]  So I think the Wall Street Journal is nuts. I think addition is gonna be like I think it could
[1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:30.020]  I think the company could make wind up making tons of money on them because even if only like one percent of the
[1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:36.260]  Watches sold are the additional ones if they're 15,000 on average. That's tons of money, right?
[1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:41.300]  It's 30 or 40 times each one of them is 30 or 40 times more expensive than a sport addition
[1:36:41.700 --> 1:36:42.500]  Um
[1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:48.580]  But as no way it's gonna be that I don't think I think the vast majority of people are gonna come in and just buy a sport as though
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:52.740]  You know like buying an iPod, you know 349 bucks boom
[1:36:54.180 --> 1:37:00.180]  Right, yeah, the market for the higher end and the highest end ones is certainly going to be very small
[1:37:00.580 --> 1:37:06.500]  Compared to the market for a consumer priced watch. Yeah, yeah, you know
[1:37:07.220 --> 1:37:11.300]  It's you know, and there's so many weird psychological things to it too where it's like
[1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:18.500]  If they only had the one if they did what seemingly would be the more obvious route and just said here's the first Apple watch
[1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:22.740]  It's three hundred forty nine dollars. It comes in these colors. That's it and maybe you know
[1:37:22.740 --> 1:37:28.340]  Maybe do the 38 and 42 millimeter size thing because there is sort of a they're not calling it men's and ladies
[1:37:28.340 --> 1:37:32.980]  But clearly there's a sort of men's and ladies divide on average risk size
[1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:35.700]  um
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:39.060]  If they did that, you know, there'd be so many people who would say wow
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:44.260]  349 bucks for a watch, you know, you know, you go in and buy a fossil watch. It's you know 75 dollars or whatever
[1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:50.580]  Um, there is that psychological thing where even if you don't even count the addition if you just look at the stainless steel
[1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:55.380]  Um, if it's right next to a thousand dollar watch three 49 looks a lot better
[1:37:56.420 --> 1:37:58.740]  Sure. Yeah, so I don't know
[1:37:58.740 --> 1:38:03.460]  I think all of that goes into the strategy that they have here, you know that that if they want to sell
[1:38:03.460 --> 1:38:08.340]  a gazillion three hundred forty nine dollar aluminum Apple watches
[1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:16.660]  That it helps them to do that by having these seemingly inexplicably more expensive if you think of them as little risk computers
[1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:19.140]  Um, right next to them
[1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:24.260]  Well, and especially because they never break break down their sales based on model right
[1:38:24.820 --> 1:38:28.500]  So a quarter in or you know a year in they can say we sold
[1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:34.900]  You know whatever 10 million watches and if only a thousand of them are the addition watches no one's ever gonna know
[1:38:36.340 --> 1:38:39.700]  Yeah, and I guess it'll just break out the earnings based on
[1:38:40.660 --> 1:38:43.140]  I guess you could maybe calculate calculated that way
[1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:49.540]  No, but they've also said though that they've even said in advance so that nobody's disappointed that they're gonna be less
[1:38:49.620 --> 1:38:52.820]  Transparent about the watch. They're not even gonna put the watches a separate item
[1:38:52.820 --> 1:38:57.220]  They're not gonna say they're not even gonna say we sold five million Apple watches. They're gonna
[1:38:57.220 --> 1:39:03.540]  Oh wow, okay. They've they've created this new other category and watch revenue will will go in there
[1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:06.340]  It's gonna be very very difficult for outsiders to
[1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:11.300]  Think you're anything. Yeah, and you know it to his credit Tim Cook is very clear about it
[1:39:11.300 --> 1:39:16.020]  It's you know for the obvious reasons competitive, you know, we don't want we don't want our competitors to know the breakdown
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:22.020]  All right, you're gonna you want to do your last sponsor break. Yeah, I do and it's our good friends at hover
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:27.860]  Hover you've ever heard of them the best way to manage domain names. I have heard of her
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:31.620]  When you want to secure a great domain name you go to hover
[1:39:31.860 --> 1:39:38.020]  They have great tools so you type in whatever your great idea.com is you know what guess what the dot com is probably taken
[1:39:38.260 --> 1:39:39.460]  They've got cool
[1:39:39.460 --> 1:39:42.100]  Maybe it's not though if it isn't you're done you can do it
[1:39:42.100 --> 1:39:49.540]  But they've got some cool features that will help you find either an alternate top-level domain other than calm or some other
[1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:51.540]  Variation or spin on
[1:39:52.420 --> 1:39:54.420]  You know the words that you're looking to use
[1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:58.060]  To make it work with a dot com great great tools
[1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:01.300]  It could not be
[1:40:01.300 --> 1:40:07.780]  I don't see how there's any hassle or friction that's left for them to remove from the process like it's as
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:13.140]  Easy and simple as it could get it. I don't see how they could get it any better in less than five minutes
[1:40:13.140 --> 1:40:17.140]  You will be able to find the domain name you want and get it up and running you
[1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:21.540]  You just search for keywords. They'll show you the best options and you go from there
[1:40:22.100 --> 1:40:25.860]  Super clean and simple. You don't have to mess around with any kind of complicated interface
[1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:32.660]  I always mentioned this but if you've ever registered domain names before and I've been registering domain names since
[1:40:33.220 --> 1:40:35.220]  Aspirin was invented in 1853
[1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:37.700]  It
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:48.660]  Notoriously, these are the worst websites in the world. It's all SEO junk. It is all crazy upsells and just it could not be a worse
[1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:55.780]  Experience there and always trying to you know, there's check boxes that are checked like uncheck if you don't want to not have
[1:40:57.460 --> 1:40:59.460]  Domain privacy security
[1:41:00.260 --> 1:41:05.300]  Added to your account. What I don't know what that means and however doesn't have any of that crap no upselling
[1:41:05.300 --> 1:41:11.460]  Just straightforward up front pricing great deal great interface
[1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:18.300]  You don't have to upgrade for things that should be included for free like who is privacy was privacy is a big one
[1:41:18.300 --> 1:41:19.300]  Who is privacy is a big one?
[1:41:19.300 --> 1:41:26.140]  Of course you want who is privacy if you don't have who is privacy you're going to get terrible spam phone calls nonstop
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:29.540]  I've got I'm from back in the day before there was who is privacy
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:35.220]  Of course you want it. Well, almost every other domain register makes you pay extra for it
[1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:38.660]  Well, it's just baked into the price of being the hover customer
[1:41:39.460 --> 1:41:46.340]  And I haven't even mentioned the most amazing thing about hover which is that they offer free valet
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:53.220]  Transfer service. So you skip the hassle. You've got domains at other lesser registrars now
[1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:58.100]  Go sign up for hover then use their free valet transfer service
[1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:05.700]  You give the kind of competent trustworthy people at hover you give them the information
[1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.700]  You know your login information for your other
[1:42:08.900 --> 1:42:10.580]  Domain registrars
[1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:18.100]  Tell them you want to move your domains to hover and they just go take care of it and they make sure all the DNS is set right
[1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:24.100]  They go through whatever hoops the other registrars going to make you go through to transfer domain
[1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:28.740]  They do it and that's all they do is transfer domain. So it's like I you know
[1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:30.260]  I'll go years without transferring it. I mean
[1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:30.980]  I don't have to do it
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:37.780]  This is all the people at hover do let the experts do it. It's it could not be easier sounds too good to be true because they do it for free
[1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:44.700]  But they do I'm telling you you just go there believe me you have domains at some crappy registrars sign up for hover
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:48.260]  Let them move them over and boom. You don't have to worry about it anymore

[1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:55.540]  Well, I'll tell you about it later
[1:43:56.740 --> 1:44:02.420]  After the show. Well before the end of the show before the end of the show. I won't make you way long. All right
[1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:05.380]  You excited about spring training
[1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:11.540]  It's too cold to be thinking about it. It seems impossible. I know and I know I'm not trying to complain to you because
[1:44:11.540 --> 1:44:18.980]  Philly's had a bad winner Boston has had like epic like the worst winner in the history of bad winners like well
[1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:20.500]  So at this point at this point
[1:44:20.500 --> 1:44:25.220]  We are I just saw it to that I think we're about three and a half inches off of the all-time
[1:44:25.780 --> 1:44:27.780]  Snowiest winter on record
[1:44:28.260 --> 1:44:33.460]  It's only the beginning of March. Well, but so at this point. I'm rooting for just a little bit more snow
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:38.340]  Like we're at like a hundred and four inches and the record is like a hundred and seven and a half inches or something
[1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:43.300]  I want to have lived through the snowiest winter of all time. I don't want any BS second place
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:47.140]  Right, so it's been terrible for like a month and a half at this point
[1:44:47.300 --> 1:44:49.300]  I might as well be a little
[1:44:49.460 --> 1:44:53.540]  Terrible for a little bit longer and then I'll have something to you know put on my resume
[1:44:53.780 --> 1:44:56.180]  Yeah, especially since you could get there with
[1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:00.260]  You don't even need like a bad snowstorm. I mean, no, no, it's just
[1:45:00.900 --> 1:45:04.980]  Flories for a couple days and we'll be set. Yeah, I mean you guys, you know at this point
[1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:09.700]  Three four inches the snow you guys may they may not even put that on TV. They may not even answer that
[1:45:10.100 --> 1:45:14.740]  Now we talk in feet now and yeah, it's it's been crazy. So yeah, I'm not thinking about
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:17.140]  I don't know. I the red socks
[1:45:18.180 --> 1:45:23.300]  I get emails from them and I've been getting the information and I'm vaguely paying attention to it
[1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:26.740]  But I don't know. I don't really get into the spring training the baseball season's long enough
[1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:30.660]  How about that the kid from Cuba that they signed all that 19 year old that they paid
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:34.740]  God only knows how much money for 63 million or something like that. Yeah
[1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:36.740]  I don't know. What do you think? Yankee fans?
[1:45:38.180 --> 1:45:42.340]  Yankee fans are starting to get antsy because if we've gone
[1:45:43.860 --> 1:45:49.220]  We've gone five years without a world series and that's right around that's when the Yankee fans start losing their their shit
[1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:52.020]  And you know this it's this
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:55.700]  You know it that's my hobby. That's my you know my my you know
[1:45:55.700 --> 1:45:58.420]  I like to watch the Yankees. I don't know if you knew that but
[1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:01.220]  One little rough
[1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:05.380]  similarity between the Yankees and Apple is you know the
[1:46:06.180 --> 1:46:12.740]  This crazy figure you know who who who's now dead who haunts the the organization the Yankees had George Steinburner
[1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:18.660]  Apple has Steve Jobs and so you run into the you know exactly like that
[1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:23.140]  This never would have happened with Steve Jobs you run into this never would have happened with George Steinburner and now
[1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:28.100]  His kids run in the team, which is really it's sort of a his kid his kids how and Hank
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:34.820]  Are you know, I think they're doing an okay job. I think it's two it's it's too short of a period of time
[1:46:34.820 --> 1:46:35.780]  Yeah, you've got it
[1:46:35.780 --> 1:46:41.260]  It's you know you're gonna have to give them 10 15 years before we really decide whether they're they're up to snuff his owners
[1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:45.660]  But with this what's a kid's name from Cuba? Oh?
[1:46:46.980 --> 1:46:49.140]  It's like yo and men Kato or something. Yeah
[1:46:50.100 --> 1:46:55.300]  You know, and it's so many of these recent players coming out of Cuba have been so good
[1:46:55.300 --> 1:47:01.020]  There's clearly so much crazy talent athletic baseball players coming out of Cuba
[1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:06.540]  But it's a ton of money for a kid who's nobody has seen play
[1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:10.140]  I mean, I'm not saying I would have been shocked if the Yankees had outbid the Red Sox
[1:47:10.140 --> 1:47:12.980]  But I don't think it's crazy that they didn't you know
[1:47:12.980 --> 1:47:19.620]  But a lot of Yankee fans are you know, George's George's role in over in this grave that he knew that in that in particular
[1:47:19.860 --> 1:47:21.460]  If he had been on the fence
[1:47:21.460 --> 1:47:27.420]  There's no way he would have let the kid go to the Red Sox right and there's a thing is there might be some truth to that
[1:47:27.420 --> 1:47:33.900]  You know that because George's the thing is is that George Steinbrenner made some moves that everybody agrees were terrible
[1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:40.300]  That he would you know insist on paying big bucks for like an aging slugger and everybody in the organization
[1:47:40.300 --> 1:47:43.900]  Like would be on the record, you know that we're not on the record, but like you know
[1:47:45.100 --> 1:47:50.020]  Anonymous sources within the Yankees organizations had that nobody nobody but George wanted this guy
[1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:52.540]  But it he overruled everybody and got him anyway
[1:47:53.140 --> 1:47:57.460]  And at this point Yankee fans are like they missed that guy
[1:47:57.460 --> 1:48:02.980]  They want they wanted the Yankees to make terrible mistakes and just spend money on everybody that they should have signed
[1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:04.980]  It's at least interesting right
[1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:10.700]  And that ultimately they at least they want if the Yankees aren't going to win
[1:48:10.700 --> 1:48:14.260]  They at least want them to be hemorrhaging cash as they do it
[1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:20.180]  And right cuz at least then they've done as much as they can right what more at least if they're burning money
[1:48:20.380 --> 1:48:27.820]  What more could we do we spent a billion dollars and we still lost whereas now it's it's starting to frustrate people that they're not
[1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:34.220]  They're not just shooting money at the at the problems right and the Yankee did we got we've got
[1:48:35.900 --> 1:48:40.940]  Alex Rodriguez back on the team. Oh, that's a that's a treat for the rest of us. I'll tell you that much
[1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:44.300]  Well, what do you think he's gonna wind up this year? I?
[1:48:46.860 --> 1:48:50.940]  I think it's is either going to be my guess is it's going to be
[1:48:51.820 --> 1:48:54.860]  binary he's either going to be a complete bust and
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:49:02.700]  Unable to play and doesn't you know it's like off the they're gonna have to like cut him and just pay him the 61 million dollars
[1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:06.860]  Or he's actually going to be okay. I think he maybe he'll hate like
[1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:14.500]  270 20 home runs 80 RBI's as as D H I was the last one was going to say you think he gets third base back
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:20.180]  Or you think no, I don't think so it doesn't it sounds the Yankees are prepared for him to be D H
[1:49:20.180 --> 1:49:26.620]  I mean I think he's got a chance to play third base, but you know they spend a surprising amount of money on Chase
[1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:31.060]  Headly yeah, exactly and you know clearly with the idea that they're gonna need him at third base
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:36.780]  I mean if if a rod can do it, I guess he will, but I don't nobody really seems to be expecting that and
[1:49:36.780 --> 1:49:40.100]  They're also giving him in Florida. They give him a lot of reps at first base
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:45.140]  Which which I think is as much about what we've got to do something with him
[1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:51.820]  And I think it's also like a sort of sad statement about what they expect out of mark to share his durability
[1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:56.420]  You know that they're already planning. Oh somebody's got it. Somebody else is going to have to play some first
[1:49:56.420 --> 1:50:04.780]  Well, I think the what did they they signed him for 10 years and then they re-signed it for 10 years like four years into that contract
[1:50:04.780 --> 1:50:06.780]  Is that right? It's a very complicated
[1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:14.380]  Contract it is it something is something to the effect of that. Yeah. Well, I think the original signing that that 10 year period
[1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:21.940]  It was it was an incredible amount of money, but they got they got a lot of value out of that the re-signing was where I think they went wrong
[1:50:22.140 --> 1:50:24.140]  Yeah, definitely
[1:50:24.140 --> 1:50:30.460]  Because it's it's the second half of that new contract that is now, you know, they're paying in the 61 million for maybe nothing
[1:50:31.180 --> 1:50:40.340]  Yeah, and the the thinking the entire thinking behind the re-signing was marketing driven not baseball driven because it was all based
[1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:43.420]  It was before any of the PED stuff had hit right
[1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:47.020]  honestly, and it was all based on projections of
[1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:52.540]  Not not any kind of like oh, we think he's going to play like his 33 year-old self forever
[1:50:52.540 --> 1:50:58.780]  Or is 32 year-old self, you know, they knew he was going to go into decline and at by the end of this contract he would you know
[1:50:59.340 --> 1:51:01.340]  Be a shuttle for myself
[1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:08.660]  But the projections all had him at look, you know, right around bonds his home run mark
[1:51:08.860 --> 1:51:14.300]  You know around that time and that he'd be breaking these historic home run records
[1:51:14.300 --> 1:51:22.580]  Uh filling the stadium with people, you know, and anticipation of him, you know getting a 700 home run getting a 750th home run
[1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:28.380]  Whereas now, you know, he could break the record and people are going to throw the ball back on the field
[1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:34.620]  Right, I mean like who gives a crap about Barry Bond's home, right?
[1:51:34.620 --> 1:51:41.340]  You know, that's the thing is even if just imagine that he does met it, you know physically come back in pretty good shape
[1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:45.500]  And actually does start hitting dingers again and plays out these three years
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:47.020]  Um
[1:51:47.020 --> 1:51:52.940]  It doesn't even matter if he breaks the record because nobody cares about the record anyway because everybody thinks bonds numbers are tainted and
[1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:55.100]  They'd be broken by the guys
[1:51:56.060 --> 1:52:00.700]  The only one who might be the more enough to hurry a user of performance and hunting drugs
[1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:04.300]  Do you even know bonds is home run number? No, I don't even know
[1:52:05.100 --> 1:52:08.860]  Ruth was 715 right right and and hang out
[1:52:08.860 --> 1:52:13.020]  744 right? No, I think it was 755. 755. All right. I knew it was a
[1:52:14.540 --> 1:52:16.060]  Double number. Yeah
[1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:19.900]  So bonds is more than that, but I don't know. I don't know how much more
[1:52:20.620 --> 1:52:22.700]  I'm gonna guess like
[1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:28.620]  780 you didn't get to 800 right. I don't remember him getting another landmark after breaking the record and 800 would have been
[1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:32.460]  Something. Yeah, I know. I don't think it's something in the seven. It's got to be like 760
[1:52:32.460 --> 1:52:35.260]  I'm gonna look it up, but I'm not gonna cheat. Let's I'm gonna say seven
[1:52:35.260 --> 1:52:38.540]  770. Okay. What are you gonna say?
[1:52:39.340 --> 1:52:44.460]  I think it was even closer. I think he just barely. I'm gonna go 760. I gotta go below you, so
[1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:50.940]  All right on career home runs. Here we go. This is a baseball reference dot com
[1:52:53.260 --> 1:52:56.540]  This is good podcast in jail. Oh, we fixed it all on post
[1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:01.660]  Let's see here
[1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:07.900]  Boy Wikipedia makes it hard to find it to home run 762. You're right. He just kind of
[1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:11.660]  Snuck past him. He has seven more home runs than
[1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:13.260]  Oh
[1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.580]  God, you know what? I've been clad. I mean, he never would have done
[1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:20.380]  I mean because one thing when you talk about Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez class doesn't really that is not
[1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:23.900]  What wouldn't have been classy if he had stopped at 754?
[1:53:24.620 --> 1:53:30.460]  You think one less or top or top? Yeah, even if he just stopped at the top. Yeah, even if he just stopped at 755
[1:53:30.460 --> 1:53:36.140]  Yeah, I feel like tied. Maybe you could have convinced him to do it, but one less. I don't think he won't fewer
[1:53:36.140 --> 1:53:38.140]  I don't think you would have gone for yeah
[1:53:39.100 --> 1:53:46.380]  All right, well, what's what's the surprise you got for me John? My surprise for you Paul is that we have a fourth sponsor this week
[1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:54.540]  All right, it is and you're gonna like him. I know you like these guys. I you like to play jokes with these guys
[1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:57.820]  It's our good friends at fracture. All right
[1:53:57.820 --> 1:54:00.140]  Uh, fracture photo swap
[1:54:00.860 --> 1:54:04.060]  Yeah, this is now this we could talk about this is a great idea for a gag
[1:54:04.700 --> 1:54:08.540]  You guys know fracture. I talked about them. They've been sponsoring the show all year long
[1:54:09.260 --> 1:54:12.380]  They take your photos. They print them directly on glass
[1:54:13.340 --> 1:54:18.860]  And you get a little package and it's right there the glass has your photo right on it
[1:54:18.860 --> 1:54:22.300]  You don't need a frame. It is a frame. You just hang it out. I don't know all you can hang it up
[1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:24.700]  You know prop it up on your mantle or your desk
[1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:29.260]  Uh, really clever packaging really great image quality
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:32.940]  Really great prices really great customer support
[1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:35.580]  All sorts of sizes
[1:54:35.660 --> 1:54:40.780]  And shapes to pick from you could do square ones print your favorite Instagrams big ones, you know
[1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:43.500]  All sorts of great things
[1:54:44.140 --> 1:54:50.220]  Have you seen this ad campaign from Apple with the it's taken with an iPhone where they're showing like photos that people have taken with their
[1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:55.660]  iPhone like they're printing them on phenomenal photo. Yeah, they're phenomenal photos, but then now it's like a billboard campaign like
[1:54:56.220 --> 1:55:00.220]  Like you just sort of forget like with the megapixels that you've got like
[1:55:00.220 --> 1:55:03.420]  Yeah, I'm sure if you got real close like when you're hanging if you're the guy hanging the billboard
[1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:05.420]  You can see the pixels or whatever, but
[1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:09.660]  When I had to you know, you said you were in the Apple store recently
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:13.580]  I was in the Apple store just last week week or two ago and they have some of these
[1:55:14.700 --> 1:55:17.980]  Customer, you know iPhone user photos up in the Apple store
[1:55:17.980 --> 1:55:23.580]  Big printed really big like panorama is printed big and it's amazing
[1:55:23.980 --> 1:55:29.980]  How good they look even when you're standing right in front of them at the wall like you can get go to fracture and get the big ones with your
[1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:30.620]  iPhone pictures
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:33.980]  They'll look great. It's amazing how much detail is in an iPhone picture
[1:55:34.780 --> 1:55:37.980]  Paul you and my wife have played games with fracture
[1:55:38.460 --> 1:55:44.300]  Let's describe the fracture photo swap. Right. So fracture sponsored the podcast. I do with your wife Amy
[1:55:44.300 --> 1:55:48.620]  It's a little show called just the tip and they sponsored the show
[1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:50.620]  And they they was actually their idea to do this
[1:55:50.620 --> 1:55:55.420]  They gave us each a coupon code and had us send a photo or photos to the other party
[1:55:56.220 --> 1:56:01.980]  And we trademarked this. This is now a joint trademark between just the tip enterprises and fracture
[1:56:02.460 --> 1:56:05.180]  And you can participate in the fracture photo swap
[1:56:05.180 --> 1:56:07.100]  All you do is you get together with a friend
[1:56:07.100 --> 1:56:09.580]  You say I'm gonna send you a photo you send me a photo
[1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:11.420]  And you just go nuts with it
[1:56:11.420 --> 1:56:15.740]  And I have you talked to pricing on this. I you haven't you haven't talked to pricing it. No, you can do it
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:17.980]  It's it's very inexpensive for the small photos
[1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:20.060]  And you can have some fun with it
[1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:25.020]  The only rule is that whatever you send the receiving party has to keep in their house for at least a year
[1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:28.860]  So then then it becomes a real conversation piece
[1:56:29.820 --> 1:56:36.300]  Which is so that you need to take that into account that explains why we have a photo of Pete Rose in this underwear
[1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.260]  Is jockeys. That's right. That's right
[1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:42.700]  You're welcome. Thank you Paul
[1:56:43.740 --> 1:56:45.740]  It's the gift that keeps on giving
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:55.180]  Do you think that that was based that was an ad that that while Pete Rose was playing you could google this just google was it Pete Rose jockeys?
[1:56:55.980 --> 1:56:58.300]  I think that's right. Yeah, it's jockey underwear
[1:57:00.780 --> 1:57:03.820]  And he he is he is not an attractive fan
[1:57:04.460 --> 1:57:07.420]  Not even then no, this is this is the height of his career
[1:57:07.420 --> 1:57:10.940]  Yeah, and the prime of his playing career did not really look
[1:57:12.300 --> 1:57:14.300]  Very attractive in his jockeys
[1:57:14.300 --> 1:57:20.380]  Do you think maybe when they had that that maybe they got the idea and they just assumed that Pete Rose with this you know
[1:57:21.260 --> 1:57:23.500]  His jersey off would look good because you know there was like
[1:57:24.460 --> 1:57:26.460]  Jim Palmer
[1:57:26.460 --> 1:57:28.460]  Very handsome picture for the
[1:57:28.460 --> 1:57:32.380]  Baltimore Orioles famously did a lot of underwear ads during his career
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:38.780]  Very handsome man looked amazing look best certainly look better than I've ever looked in the best day of my life in this underwear
[1:57:38.780 --> 1:57:40.780]  Look great look like he should be modeling underwear
[1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:46.300]  Do you think that there's somebody at jockey was like well, we'll get Pete Rose. He's a great player. He's you know, he's you know
[1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:48.460]  He's gonna look great
[1:57:48.460 --> 1:57:52.140]  and they so you know they called him and he stayed came to terms and
[1:57:53.580 --> 1:57:58.140]  And they signed a contract and then they then they got to see him in his jockeys
[1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:04.940]  I thought I think that's my guess is to how that came to be but they still could have saved money by not printing the ad
[1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:06.940]  I mean, that's good money after bad
[1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:12.540]  Well anyway, my thanks to fracture send every you know do the fracture photo swap
[1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:18.220]  It's great fun do whatever you want with them, but they had great great company great products lots of fun
[1:58:18.860 --> 1:58:24.460]  The code that you want to remember is daring fireball all one word daring fireball and you will save
[1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:29.820]  15% on whatever it is that you order including I'm betting fracture photo swap
[1:58:30.540 --> 1:58:31.900]  There you go
[1:58:31.900 --> 1:58:33.740]  I won last day. I got to go soon
[1:58:34.060 --> 1:58:38.940]  We've been chatting for a while, but I wanted to talk why I had you because I wanted to get your insight on this
[1:58:38.940 --> 1:58:41.980]  I think you're gonna give me a big fat. I told you so about app pricing
[1:58:42.620 --> 1:58:44.620]  so my oh, yes, my friends
[1:58:45.340 --> 1:58:50.700]  Brent and Dave and I at cube ranch we we've just a few days ago released a new update to our app Vesper
[1:58:50.700 --> 1:58:54.300]  that adds iPad support on iOS and
[1:58:55.100 --> 1:58:59.340]  Coincident with that to a universal binary, but we've raised the price of the app
[1:59:00.140 --> 1:59:06.860]  To 999 right I think for the next 10 days. We're still gonna keep it at 799 which is higher than it has been all along
[1:59:07.740 --> 1:59:12.940]  but the ret new default regular price once this intro period is over is gonna be 999 and
[1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:16.940]  You know, I don't want to
[1:59:16.940 --> 1:59:22.540]  Going to trade about it, but just more or less that we've we've we've concluded that the idea that you can go low
[1:59:22.700 --> 1:59:29.020]  And we've been at 2.99 for months before before this update came out that you can go low and make it up with
[1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:37.580]  Quantity because the iOS market is so big that it just that just doesn't work or it doesn't work for the type of app that Vesper is which
[1:59:37.580 --> 1:59:39.580]  I would call like
[1:59:39.580 --> 1:59:46.620]  A deeper app. Yeah, and like a productivity app. It's not a game. It's not a gimme out. It's not a yeah, you know, but it's sort of basically it's like
[1:59:46.780 --> 1:59:53.900]  The type of apps that indie developers have been making for the Mac for decades now. It's on iOS like a Mac app on iOS
[1:59:55.260 --> 2:00:00.540]  And I don't think that that works and I mean Mac in terms of like being something that you do like you work with it
[2:00:00.540 --> 2:00:02.780]  You do things productivity. I don't know I
[2:00:02.780 --> 2:00:08.300]  I definitely do want to say I told you so, but I think it's it's something where
[2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:16.620]  What six years ago my company released an iPhone app and we priced it at 9.99 and it didn't work
[2:00:17.900 --> 2:00:23.420]  But I felt like at least we went down swinging. We went down at a price where we were content
[2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:29.100]  And I think exactly like you said trying to make it up on volume doesn't work unless you
[2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:33.100]  You wind up with one of the apps, you know, an angry birds or
[2:00:33.900 --> 2:00:39.660]  People that's it's a game to it games are different. I think games are as a totally different market and
[2:00:41.660 --> 2:00:44.380]  You know, there's other apps that to me. It's a different type of
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:47.500]  It's just a different category
[2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:51.740]  I'm talking right and I will also add and I don't want to be self
[2:00:52.540 --> 2:00:57.020]  So self-centered as to presume that Vesper is good enough that it
[2:00:57.020 --> 2:01:00.860]  Should be making more money. So let's just leave Vesper out
[2:01:00.860 --> 2:01:07.740]  Maybe the problem is that Vesper isn't original enough. Maybe the you know the problem is Vesper the eye opening thing to me was in panics
[2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:13.500]  Annual letter that they published on their blog back in early January
[2:01:14.220 --> 2:01:17.580]  Where cable sassers just flat out said, you know, they had a great year
[2:01:17.580 --> 2:01:22.060]  They had so many apps that came out Mac and iOS and they had iOS versions of
[2:01:22.060 --> 2:01:27.340]  At coda the mini coda whatever they call coda like
[2:01:27.980 --> 2:01:34.380]  Diet coda diet coda. Oh, what a great name. That is can't believe a drew a blank on that. They have their terminal app
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:38.620]  Prompt prompt great great so
[2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:44.780]  Transmit for iOS. Transmit for iOS which is a phenomenal app really really well done
[2:01:44.780 --> 2:01:46.300]  It's every you close your eyes
[2:01:46.300 --> 2:01:51.340]  You think well, what would panic do if they did transmit for iOS and your mind starts running wild without, you know
[2:01:51.340 --> 2:01:55.500]  Detailed it would be well. That's exactly what it is. It's a remarkable remarkable app
[2:01:56.700 --> 2:02:01.740]  And truly a Mac caliber app in terms of the scope of what it does, you know
[2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:05.820]  It's a full-featured file transfer app, you know for a whole bunch of great services
[2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:11.260]  And you know in their annual letter, you know cable flat out said that the
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:16.460]  The revenue that they're making from these iOS apps doesn't justify
[2:02:16.460 --> 2:02:21.820]  The engineering expense of making these apps compared to
[2:02:22.540 --> 2:02:29.340]  The revenue they get from the same amount of work on the Mac apps right doing the same amount of work on the Mac is gonna pay so much better
[2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:32.620]  Then it does on iOS right and there's no, you know
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:35.260]  I mean there do different platforms but in terms of which you know
[2:02:35.260 --> 2:02:40.940]  It you know how much it costs to pay for a talented engineer to spend you know eight to ten hours
[2:02:41.660 --> 2:02:44.060]  Tomorrow coding for it. It's the same right?
[2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:49.180]  Like you don't get you know if anything iOS developers are more in demand
[2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:52.140]  Right, it's even harder to hire them
[2:02:54.300 --> 2:02:58.620]  And that to me was an eye opener to me that if panic is saying hey
[2:02:59.500 --> 2:03:02.700]  Something funny is going on on iOS because you know
[2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:04.780]  We're not getting the bang for our buck
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:09.980]  You know we have to think about how we're gonna do this because we can't justify this because if we put these resources toward the Mac
[2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:12.060]  We'd be making more money
[2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:17.580]  Um and that to me is an eye opener because those apps are fantastic. I like there's just I mean it's
[2:03:18.220 --> 2:03:22.380]  You know I'm too close to Vesper to judge Vesper objectively, but I can judge
[2:03:23.100 --> 2:03:26.540]  panics apps objectively and they are best of breed
[2:03:27.420 --> 2:03:29.180]  Yeah, and yeah, I've got it right in front of me
[2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:35.660]  They basically they had a 50 50 split for iOS versus Mac sales and then the Mac was 83% of their revenue
[2:03:35.980 --> 2:03:39.180]  Right, so I mean just in terms of the way the numbers work
[2:03:39.180 --> 2:03:43.980]  Yeah, you certainly should be devoting more of your resources to the Mac and that's unfortunate because
[2:03:44.300 --> 2:03:48.220]  iOS is a fun platform. It's an interesting platform to be developing for
[2:03:48.780 --> 2:03:53.980]  But right now there's the money just isn't there. Yeah, and I think that we're starting to see it now like to me
[2:03:55.180 --> 2:03:59.980]  Uh eight years in I guess it's a or seven years. I guess seven years since the app store
[2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:01.180]  Um
[2:04:01.180 --> 2:04:08.780]  It's long enough and the devices, you know, Moore's law has had its effect like our current iPhones and iPads are so powerful
[2:04:09.180 --> 2:04:13.740]  Uh, you know, they're clear, you know, the current iPads are clearly on par with the
[2:04:14.380 --> 2:04:17.740]  Mac books of the time when the iPhone came out
[2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:24.220]  I mean the the devices aren't limiting them, but I really think that for seven years in there's a dearth of
[2:04:25.020 --> 2:04:30.860]  Like what I would call like just name any of your favorite indie Mac apps from the last 20 years
[2:04:30.860 --> 2:04:35.180]  And we're not seeing them get developed on iOS. I mean not that there's none
[2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:37.740]  But that we're just not seeing as many as we should
[2:04:39.260 --> 2:04:41.260]  Well, and I wonder if
[2:04:41.980 --> 2:04:44.780]  I definitely there are people inside of Apple who are aware of this
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:50.780]  But I wonder if the people who can do something about it are blinded by the fact that there are these phenomenal
[2:04:50.860 --> 2:04:58.300]  Success stories where companies come out of nowhere and suddenly make millions upon millions of dollars because they have this hit 99% app
[2:04:58.300 --> 2:05:03.740]  But it disguises the fact that so many developers try and fail and move on
[2:05:05.100 --> 2:05:09.420]  And just can't really make a living at it let alone a good living at it
[2:05:10.460 --> 2:05:13.660]  Yeah, I don't know and you know and part of it and out
[2:05:14.060 --> 2:05:16.540]  You know because we could go on for an hour just about the app store angle
[2:05:16.540 --> 2:05:21.180]  But part of it is clearly just the the having to go through the app store limits
[2:05:21.740 --> 2:05:24.620]  iOS development in certain ways, but let's ignore that for now
[2:05:24.620 --> 2:05:29.820]  I you know, I think it's safe to ignore it. There's something more to it than that like you've broken me
[2:05:29.820 --> 2:05:32.380]  But you guys don't have any iOS apps right now, right?
[2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:39.980]  We've got too small their companion apps to our Mac apps because that's what we've felt has been the most valuable thing to do is to
[2:05:40.860 --> 2:05:42.860]  expend our resources on the Mac and
[2:05:43.180 --> 2:05:46.220]  We certainly want to be involved on iOS. It's like I said
[2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:47.100]  It's an exciting platform
[2:05:47.100 --> 2:05:49.100]  But if the money's not there we'd rather
[2:05:49.340 --> 2:05:51.180]  Have them be a companion to a Mac app
[2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:58.540]  So, you know, here's a free airfoils speakers which works with our app airfoil and you pay for the airfoil app on the Mac and you get the the iOS app for free
[2:05:59.500 --> 2:06:04.620]  And it's you know, it's not necessarily the best way to do things, but it's the way that we found works
[2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:09.500]  I remember I remember therefore. I didn't even think of it as an app because it's not you know
[2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:14.140]  I mean like to me it's not an app. It's a thing on your phone that it's just part of it using airfoil
[2:06:14.540 --> 2:06:15.820]  Right exactly so it's effective
[2:06:15.820 --> 2:06:22.140]  Yeah, effectively you guys that were treating the iPhone the way that like it's like the Apple watch, right?
[2:06:22.140 --> 2:06:26.300]  It's just this little thing where you yeah, you're you've got apps for it and you've written code for it
[2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:29.820]  But it's really just a like you said a peripheral to the main thing
[2:06:30.460 --> 2:06:32.460]  Yeah, exactly and and
[2:06:33.020 --> 2:06:38.540]  That that works, but it's I would love to see the sort of thing that you're talking about where you have a
[2:06:39.100 --> 2:06:44.060]  You know first-class application experience on the phone or on the iPad and you know
[2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:46.380]  We can devote our resources to that and then charge
[2:06:47.020 --> 2:06:51.980]  10 $20 $30 which is what you need to charge in terms of the volume you're going to see on an average
[2:06:52.700 --> 2:06:59.100]  Product because you can't make enough money selling it for 99 cents or $299 or even $499
[2:06:59.660 --> 2:07:04.940]  And I think if I'm not mistaken in the in the panic letter that they sent out to that they post on their blog
[2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:11.500]  They also mentioned talking about discounted upgrades, and that's a big thing that I think the app stores are lacking and have been lacking and
[2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:14.220]  and it means that you need to
[2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:17.020]  either charge full price for version 2
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:22.460]  or I mean that's really pretty much your only option besides giving it away and
[2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:25.420]  Upgrade revenue is definitely a way that
[2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:33.420]  For 20 or 30 years now companies have been selling software and making money and it encourages companies to make a version 2 and a
[2:07:33.420 --> 2:07:39.180]  Version 3 and not have to worry. Oh, we got to sell all over to people when they can just say hey
[2:07:39.180 --> 2:07:42.140]  This new version has a bunch of new features. We think you're gonna like it
[2:07:42.620 --> 2:07:46.460]  Because you bought the first version you get a big discount on it, but we still get a little bit of revenue
[2:07:46.940 --> 2:07:51.100]  They don't just have to live off the revenue from the first product or try and sell a whole new product
[2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:55.260]  And I think not having that really sort of stunts the ability to
[2:07:55.900 --> 2:08:01.820]  Make deeper products and longer term products. Yeah, a borrow tight to tie the whole show together bring it full circle
[2:08:01.820 --> 2:08:06.060]  I'll borrow a term from the watch world. There's a terminal watch world a tool watch
[2:08:06.060 --> 2:08:11.500]  So for example like a diver watch a watch that can go 300 meters under under water
[2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:16.220]  Which you think about it is terrifying. That's like that's an extraordinary depth
[2:08:18.220 --> 2:08:23.540]  You know watches that are meant to be you know treated roughly and you know to to work or
[2:08:25.020 --> 2:08:30.820]  You know like chronometer watches like that race car drivers would wear and actually use you know to time their
[2:08:30.820 --> 2:08:35.580]  They're racing and stuff like that. That's the type of app. So that's a good word tool, right?
[2:08:35.580 --> 2:08:39.180]  Like tool apps like you know audio hijack is a tool
[2:08:39.780 --> 2:08:44.820]  It's a serious tool that people you can use it for fun too, but you know be be at it is a tool
[2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:51.460]  Right those type of apps need continuous first for long-term success need continuous development
[2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:59.260]  Like you guys you guys have been working on audio hijack like effectively. I'm not that not that well non-stop
[2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:01.820]  right like for 13 years. Yeah, and
[2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:07.380]  The there's no other way to do that without upgrade revenue or some kind of you know
[2:09:07.740 --> 2:09:11.700]  Like a subscription typing. I mean clearly that's like what Adobe is pivoting
[2:09:11.700 --> 2:09:16.060]  And successfully I mean it's or so far it seems like it
[2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:20.860]  But to justify that you know because all of their apps that we think of they're you know
[2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:28.340]  They're tools and the only way to keep them going is with some sort of sustained revenue stream from your existing users and the
[2:09:28.340 --> 2:09:31.020]  A whole idea that you know once you've paid for it you get it forever
[2:09:31.460 --> 2:09:39.620]  Just doesn't work and anytime people have tried it. It's always fallen apart. I mean I think of poor text mate, right? Where?
[2:09:41.780 --> 2:09:48.260]  Alan Augdard had great success. You know came out with a new text editor. It was a sensation all the rails developers loved it
[2:09:49.140 --> 2:09:54.540]  Really seemed to strike a chord with like the the new to the Mac users who you know
[2:09:54.540 --> 2:10:00.220]  Maybe didn't weren't for somehow turned off by BB at its sort of Mac likeness
[2:10:01.340 --> 2:10:05.340]  But then he promised that the next major upgrade was going to be a free update, you know
[2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:11.300]  And which I thought wow that is a crazy-ass thing to say because I you know if it wasn't for upgrades
[2:10:11.300 --> 2:10:14.100]  I don't see how barebones would still be in business. I mean
[2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:20.460]  I'm sure that they still get some number of new customers, but you know I've paid for upgrades
[2:10:20.460 --> 2:10:23.060]  I even worked for them for two years, but I must have paid for
[2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:26.620]  I don't know six or seven upgrades over the last
[2:10:27.780 --> 2:10:30.100]  You know 15 years of using BB at it
[2:10:30.380 --> 2:10:36.180]  Right, well and the key is that it got you new features a new function out right happily so right and got you
[2:10:36.180 --> 2:10:41.500]  Yeah, you were happy to do it because it got you, you know the top of the line product the current product and
[2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:48.460]  On iOS I think you're seeing a whole lot of stuff get abandoned because it doesn't make enough money up front and
[2:10:48.460 --> 2:10:54.860]  And then you know you can't you can't like I said earlier you can't keep throwing good money after bad or you know
[2:10:54.860 --> 2:10:58.620]  Good time after bad when a product isn't successful enough right up front
[2:10:58.620 --> 2:11:06.500]  It's not going to be successful long-term because you can't afford to make it successful. Yeah, so my conclusion my my new working theory is that for tool apps
[2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:12.620]  That the market on iOS is actually not much bigger at all than the Mac
[2:11:12.620 --> 2:11:20.420]  It's roughly the same size and the fact that there are 200 million iOS users total is irrelevant because I don't know
[2:11:20.820 --> 2:11:24.820]  180 million of them would never even consider spending money on like
[2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:30.900]  Which to me is not a crazy expensive app like a nine ninety nine app right, but it's done never gonna do it
[2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:34.660]  like the way that those hundred and eighty million people do it is they go to the App Store and
[2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:36.940]  they search for what they're looking for and
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:43.140]  And if it's a notes app they type notes and then they look for one that's free and then they keep downloading free ones
[2:11:43.140 --> 2:11:48.540]  Until they find one that's good enough and there's so many of them that they're eventually going to find one
[2:11:48.540 --> 2:11:52.460]  That's good enough and that's it and then never go past it. So it doesn't matter whether you're 99 cents or
[2:11:52.780 --> 2:11:56.180]  199 or 999 they're never looking past the free ones and
[2:11:57.020 --> 2:12:00.140]  Not that there aren't people you know, there's I think there's you know
[2:12:00.140 --> 2:12:06.860]  Same way that there's 10 20 30 million active Mac users who will consider spending a reasonable amount of money on a good app
[2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:08.860]  I think that there's the same number of people
[2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:14.380]  I think that all those same people have an iPhone in their pocket and would consider doing the same thing for the iPhone
[2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:16.500]  but there's
[2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:22.380]  You have to price it accordingly though. You still you can't price it for it at low roll 200 million people, right?
[2:12:22.380 --> 2:12:29.140]  You cannot do it and it might be less than the Mac version just because it's it's a smaller app and it does take slightly
[2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:34.700]  You know slightly less time to do the iPhone app than the Mac app because there might be you know
[2:12:34.700 --> 2:12:35.580]  You don't have to do Apple script
[2:12:35.580 --> 2:12:36.300]  You don't have to you know
[2:12:36.300 --> 2:12:42.020]  There's all sorts of things you may not be able to do but it still has to be commensurate to what you would charge for the Mac version
[2:12:42.220 --> 2:12:49.300]  Well the interesting analogy to me is it's sort of analogous to the split between Mac and Windows that when we first came out on the
[2:12:49.300 --> 2:12:53.660]  Mac a decade ago more than that and had some success people said oh you should be on Windows
[2:12:53.660 --> 2:13:02.420]  There's you know ten or a hundred times as many users, but I think it's a very similar thing where there aren't ten or a hundred times as many people willing to pay for software
[2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:05.300]  Yeah, there might be more there might even be fewer
[2:13:05.580 --> 2:13:14.300]  But it's not as if you can just look at the size of the user base and say okay, that's the possible number of people we can sell to and I think on the iPhone
[2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:20.340]  It's very similar where you know of those however 200 million devices how many of those are in the hands of kids or
[2:13:20.340 --> 2:13:26.380]  or you know our secondary devices so you know it's not really that there's that many active users out there
[2:13:26.380 --> 2:13:30.060]  Yeah, it's it's the market isn't necessarily that much bigger and you know
[2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:33.260]  I you think it might be the same size it might be smaller might be bigger
[2:13:33.260 --> 2:13:34.820]  I don't I don't have a good number
[2:13:34.820 --> 2:13:39.260]  But I think it's silly to just look and say oh they sold so many hundreds of millions of devices
[2:13:39.260 --> 2:13:42.300]  That's obviously the market to attack. Yeah, I just think it doesn't actually work
[2:13:42.300 --> 2:13:48.980]  You have to pick a price that's commensurate with how you would price the equivalent Mac app and I really do believe that and it's you know
[2:13:48.980 --> 2:13:53.900]  And I but I realized that the app store is not set up to promote apps like that
[2:13:53.900 --> 2:13:59.140]  Like you're not going to get on the best selling chart that way and being on the best selling chart does get you downloads
[2:13:59.140 --> 2:14:00.300]  It's you know
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:05.260]  Well, the only the only thing that Apple added what a couple years in was the top
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:13.300]  Generating top revenue generating apps right and that's that's the one sort of shop that we got that you know if you do have a more expensive app
[2:14:14.140 --> 2:14:16.900]  Potentially you could wind up on that chart and that that could be useful
[2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:22.620]  But I don't think it's in the end played out that way because I think that's a whole lot of that is in-app purchase stuff where
[2:14:23.100 --> 2:14:26.180]  It could be a free or a freemium game type thing where
[2:14:26.580 --> 2:14:31.980]  You know you got it for free and then you spend a whole bunch of money on coins or whatever and that's what winds up topping those charts
[2:14:31.980 --> 2:14:38.060]  I think it's it as you said that the store is just aren't set up to promote an app that is priced sustainably. Yeah
[2:14:38.580 --> 2:14:41.420]  Totally agree so you were right. I was wrong
[2:14:41.420 --> 2:14:49.060]  Well, I just I well I only wish you know hopefully people listen and and developers listen and say you know what
[2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:51.860]  I'm not making enough money at two ninety nine or four ninety nine
[2:14:51.860 --> 2:14:56.980]  I should try a higher price because that's that's really what it is is that you can't be the only one that does it
[2:14:56.980 --> 2:15:02.380]  That's what we tried it in the first place and it didn't work and even even someone like you who's got you know an audience
[2:15:02.380 --> 2:15:07.740]  Who will listen to this? I don't know that it needs a title change from everybody really to make it sustainable
[2:15:07.740 --> 2:15:11.660]  You know ever since we wrote about it and Jason Snell I'll link it in the show notes
[2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:15.820]  Jason Snell had a brief interview with me about it today that I thought was came off pretty good
[2:15:15.820 --> 2:15:17.860]  I've gotten a lot we've gotten a lot of feedback about it
[2:15:17.860 --> 2:15:22.900]  And it does seem like I think that there's a movement of foot to maybe do this and it might have to
[2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:26.940]  It is I think harkening back to almost the pre-app store days where we're you know
[2:15:26.940 --> 2:15:34.020]  You're gonna have to do your marketing on your own outside the app store, but that you know that that for a certain class of tool app that the prices
[2:15:34.020 --> 2:15:40.540]  I think are going to go up. I think there's momentum I hope so. Yeah, hey, so let's wrap it up
[2:15:40.540 --> 2:15:44.220]  But let's put a shout out to audio hijack. So audio hijack
[2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:50.700]  The new version is three point oh right that's right. It is version 3.0 big hit
[2:15:51.260 --> 2:15:55.500]  For you guys are real gimme, but do you guys have a patch upgrade? You have the 301 yet?
[2:15:56.260 --> 2:16:01.740]  302 and I think 303 will probably be probably not before this air, but yeah, we're at 302 now
[2:16:01.740 --> 2:16:09.900]  What's the price? It's $49, but if anyone has bought any audio hijack in the past any product with audio hijack in the name
[2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:16.860]  Which there were a couple different versions whenever it's a $25 upgrade. That's it. That's a bargain. That's absolute positive bargain
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:23.700]  I bet you get a lot of very well, but there's a lot of die-hard audio hijack users who are begging you to take their $25
[2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:30.860]  It has been incredible to get a whole lot of feedback from people who have been using it forever and love the new version and
[2:16:30.860 --> 2:16:36.220]  You know, I'm sure everybody who ever puts out a new version says this is the best version and Apple always says that but
[2:16:36.580 --> 2:16:43.420]  In this case, it's it's just been phenomenally well received to the point where I would not have expected it. No, well
[2:16:43.420 --> 2:16:45.420]  I think it's really I had you're
[2:16:46.340 --> 2:16:52.220]  Your colleague Krista on a few episodes ago and we talked about the interface which is to me fantastic
[2:16:52.220 --> 2:16:59.700]  I think you guys got I think just from my sense from talking to Krista was that you guys got too close to the interface during its development
[2:16:59.700 --> 2:17:02.780]  And you lost sight of just how radically better it was
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:08.780]  Because in terms of the past several years of developing version three yes that you guys you guys were
[2:17:08.860 --> 2:17:14.060]  Knows to the grind zone on that interface for so long and you became infin-intimantly familiar with it and
[2:17:15.300 --> 2:17:20.780]  And then it came out and I think it was just I think it's that interface that's driving the hit because to me
[2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:25.180]  I always I always knew what audio hijack did but I have to admit that when I looked at it
[2:17:25.180 --> 2:17:29.260]  I was always little like I have to I have to read and think about what I'm doing here
[2:17:29.260 --> 2:17:34.900]  Whereas with the new interface it's in an instant you can see exactly what is going on and it's you know
[2:17:35.380 --> 2:17:41.500]  Yeah, I mean that that was certainly the idea was we've got a pipeline and you can visually see my audio is going from here to here
[2:17:41.500 --> 2:17:47.100]  And it's doing what I expected to do and previously we had most of the power that's in this version
[2:17:47.100 --> 2:17:53.100]  But it was a lot more difficult to suss out right but and you know and on the back end you guys have been through so much
[2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:59.820]  It's always been a Mac OS 10 product. It hasn't it debuted on Mac OS 10 so you don't have any classic Mac OS roots, right?
[2:18:00.460 --> 2:18:06.220]  There was there was a plug-in version back on Mac OS 9, but as a product it was it's always been on Mac OS 10
[2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:08.380]  You guys have been through so many technical
[2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:14.540]  Differences in at the level that you that audio hijack needs to operate in terms of you know
[2:18:14.540 --> 2:18:17.780]  I mean there was no core audio back in 2001
[2:18:18.900 --> 2:18:20.900]  What's there I don't think so I
[2:18:20.900 --> 2:18:28.380]  I mean yeah, we've gone through we've gone through what 11 different versions of the operating system and it's it's it's it's been
[2:18:28.380 --> 2:18:31.580]  It's been a pretty long journey as far as getting to where we are
[2:18:31.580 --> 2:18:35.620]  But the only way that that worked was through upgrade pricing and having a sane
[2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:43.780]  Sustainable price to start with pricing the bigger thing for us was having a price that you know made money as opposed to selling for 99 cents
[2:18:43.780 --> 2:18:49.060]  But certainly version three having an upgrade price has been essential right because there's no other way
[2:18:49.060 --> 2:18:53.700]  I mean, how could you justify three years of development on it if if you weren't gonna do it so anyway
[2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:57.300]  Mike congrats well deserve success on that app. It's thank you
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:02.580]  Should win all the awards in my opinion. Well, it's you know, it's funny somebody said that and
[2:19:03.300 --> 2:19:09.060]  It got me thinking there aren't very many Mac awards left anymore. No week. Well, we lost Mac worlds
[2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:15.780]  Eddie awards are they gonna do that or then they didn't they didn't do it at the end of last year with their with their slim down staff
[2:19:15.780 --> 2:19:22.100]  You know the the the ada's are now only for the app store which audio hijack can't be in
[2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:28.580]  We lost I mean all the Mac magazines have disappeared and that was really the people that were doing a lot of the awards
[2:19:28.820 --> 2:19:29.700]  Yeah
[2:19:29.700 --> 2:19:36.020]  So it's that actually somebody said that somebody said exactly that that it should win all the awards and I said that's that's a lovely thing to say
[2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:41.860]  And it made me depressed because there really aren't any of these sort of community recognition awards anymore
[2:19:41.860 --> 2:19:43.860]  Yeah, the ada's
[2:19:43.860 --> 2:19:45.860]  You know, it's an achievement
[2:19:46.860 --> 2:19:52.100]  More than an award it everybody if you get an ADA you've done good work
[2:19:52.100 --> 2:19:57.540]  There is no way to get one that is not involved good work, but it's it's not really an award
[2:19:57.540 --> 2:20:03.300]  It's you know you've done good work that is exactly where Apple wants you to be doing good work this year
[2:20:03.300 --> 2:20:08.980]  It's it's right, you know not that again. I'm not downplaying it. I would certainly accept I would happily accept one
[2:20:08.980 --> 2:20:17.540]  But it's to call it in a you know, I don't know. It's not like the ada's used to be where it was a more objective
[2:20:18.500 --> 2:20:23.700]  And had more of like a year to year fairness to it like the ADA is shift radically
[2:20:23.700 --> 2:20:26.180]  I mean there was one year where they were like it, you know iOS only
[2:20:26.980 --> 2:20:31.220]  Well, and they had like they had an ada category like best dashboard widget
[2:20:31.940 --> 2:20:36.260]  And you know it was clearly it was in Apple's promotional interests
[2:20:36.260 --> 2:20:40.580]  Where is right the the eddies and and other awards like it were you know
[2:20:40.580 --> 2:20:43.380]  Just this is the best software and best products we saw this year
[2:20:44.100 --> 2:20:49.620]  And and yeah, I so the one that is I actually I email their friend Renee Ritchie at I more
[2:20:49.860 --> 2:20:52.580]  Because they do an annual award and I said, you know
[2:20:52.660 --> 2:20:54.580]  Somebody made me realize that so many of these are gone
[2:20:54.660 --> 2:20:57.380]  I'm glad that I'm more is still doing them and and you know
[2:20:57.540 --> 2:20:59.780]  I certainly I hope we are in the running for one
[2:20:59.780 --> 2:21:04.580]  But ignoring that it's just nice that someone is looking at the whole community and looking at you know
[2:21:04.580 --> 2:21:09.780]  Everything as a whole and saying these are things that actually deserve some recognition and some attention. Yeah
[2:21:10.340 --> 2:21:12.340]  There's the crunchies
[2:21:13.620 --> 2:21:15.620]  Doesn't that have like a gorilla statue
[2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:18.100]  I think it's got like a 2001
[2:21:18.100 --> 2:21:24.180]  Gorilla styles did you see I got nominated Daring Fireball got nominated for the best bootstrapped startup
[2:21:25.300 --> 2:21:27.300]  This year this year
[2:21:27.300 --> 2:21:32.980]  What I just go look it up Daring Fireball was nominated in this year's crunchy awards
[2:21:32.980 --> 2:21:35.860]  For best bootstrapped startup
[2:21:36.580 --> 2:21:40.420]  This in my uh, what 13th year for writing the website
[2:21:40.980 --> 2:21:43.460]  Wow, did you oh you didn't win you didn't win
[2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:46.980]  Thank God. Oh god. We got some kind of autoplay video
[2:21:47.380 --> 2:21:50.020]  All right. All right. Let's wrap it up. My thanks to our sponsors
