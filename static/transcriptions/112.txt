[00:00.000 --> 00:05.180]  Feel like we got to talk about the thing which thing my thing. How was your with your eyeball? Yeah
[00:06.280 --> 00:08.280]  I'm game
[00:08.880 --> 00:10.880]  How was your week
[00:13.680 --> 00:16.560]  I don't know if I don't think I've talked to you about it
[00:16.560 --> 00:20.400]  We haven't we haven't had a working refrigerator in five weeks Amy mentioned that to me
[00:20.520 --> 00:24.000]  yeah, it's a hell of a thing and that you're it's like you've got like I
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.360]  I mean obviously you could for five foot within the last five weeks
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.760]  you could have just run out and bought a new refrigerator, but you're in you're in some kind of a spat with your
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.440]  refrigerator
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.760]  Like it's not even just on principle. It's first of all getting a fridge in here requires a crane
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.040]  So that's a whole thing
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.880]  So we were trying to get it fixed because instead of needing to hire a crane to bring a new fridge in and take the old
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.540]  One out. Why would you need a crane? Is this like a step situation a staircase situation? Yeah staircase
[00:56.540 --> 01:04.100]  They're too narrow and and modern refrigerators are in the size of a car exactly. Okay, so it's a whole thing and finally
[01:05.080 --> 01:09.640]  They were trying to fix it and I was like fine fix it. I don't care and finally they said, okay, we can't fix it
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.280]  Here's two grand and I said great
[01:12.280 --> 01:18.000]  I'll buy a new fridge and then I found out that I needed to get it repair need to get it craned in rather and
[01:18.280 --> 01:20.280]  So the two grand doesn't even cover it
[01:20.280 --> 01:26.000]  Is it's it hasn't been good. So what do you what are you doing with your perishables?
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.320]  I mean it is on the other hand you guys are in the midst of record cold
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.200]  So, I mean like you could you could keep like frozen stuff outside, right?
[01:33.720 --> 01:37.460]  Right, but the temperature fluctuates too much such that like, you know
[01:37.460 --> 01:41.560]  If you got your if you got something that only need only needs to be refrigerated. It's no good
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.760]  Yeah, it's no good too cold. And then some days it gets warm enough that anything you have out there. It's frozen is no good
[01:46.760 --> 01:51.720]  I got a little mini fridge. That's that's all I've got right now. Did you buy that especially just for this?
[01:52.580 --> 01:56.160]  No, fortunately, I guess it was a wine cooler. It's it's
[01:56.680 --> 01:59.320]  But it gets down when you crank it like as cold as it goes
[01:59.320 --> 02:02.000]  I'm looking at it right now when it get when you crank it down as low as it goes
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.120]  It's it's cold enough to keep some milk. And what the hell else do I have in there? I got some pasta sauce and
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.120]  Some butter
[02:11.120 --> 02:13.440]  I'm living like a savage John. What about ice?
[02:13.440 --> 02:16.920]  That's outside. I can just grab a handful, right?
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.820]  Now you have like ice cubes or you just taking like snow or something like that. I have not been using ice
[02:22.820 --> 02:25.920]  I've been drinking my my drinks straight up
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.160]  So how much snow do you have outside still is it is it come down at all?
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.160]  Do you got you I mean is it like up over your your ears? We we crossed 32 degrees
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.120]  It was above freezing today for the first time in I think the second time in like a month
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.480]  So we lost a little bit today. That was good
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.400]  Like depth wise if I look outside a small child would still be buried
[02:48.400 --> 02:51.400]  Like we got it. We got a good couple two three four feet
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.720]  It's crazy
[02:55.200 --> 02:59.600]  Which also doesn't help when you need to get a fridge in and it's you know, like I'm saying this whole thing
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.880]  It's not like I'm I'm just saying no I refuse to buy a new fridge. I'm trying to buy a new fridge
[03:04.520 --> 03:06.520]  It's still a whole headache
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.080]  It's just one of those things you just never really anticipate and having to do without
[03:12.880 --> 03:18.120]  No, exactly. I've never and I've never had to buy one either. I've never bought appliances before for example
[03:18.120 --> 03:23.320]  Imagine like if you're give your toilet stopped working like that could happen, right? Especially
[03:24.360 --> 03:25.000]  You know
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.760]  I think it's a lot more likely that let's say if you live in a small apartment with only one
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.120]  Toilet that it could break and then you know, you obviously you would you would accelerate, you know
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.440]  You call your plumber and explain the situation and hopefully get it expedited service
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.920]  But in the meantime, I feel like it would it would never stop you. You just every 15 minutes
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.080]  You'd forget and you'd go to pee just go and use the toilet again
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.360]  Well, not that you would actually use it. I'm sure that by time, you know, you look at the broken toilet
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.360]  you realize ah crap, but it's like
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.160]  What would you do? I mean, I guess you'd like pee in a jar or something. I don't know. I guess I don't know
[03:59.160 --> 04:01.520]  I hopefully that doesn't come up. We got a couple bathrooms
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.280]  So that one I should be good on that one, but only got one fridge, right?
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.520]  But it's the same, you know, you just take modern, you know, these modern luxuries for granted
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.120]  We don't even think of them as luxuries, but they are. Oh, yeah. Well, it's funny. I was talking to my grandmother
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.960]  She's 90 years old and she used to have an icebox like a literal icebox
[04:20.280 --> 04:23.360]  Where they would put a piece of ice in there to keep things cold
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.760]  right, it's just like a big steel box and then a guy would come once a week with like a
[04:28.760 --> 04:35.200]  A chunk of like 20 pound block of ice. Yeah, like a microwave oven sized block of ice, right and drop it in there
[04:35.200 --> 04:37.200]  and then that would yeah, you'd keep your
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.760]  Keep your perishables in there. Well, the thing she told me is that you you had to drain it all the time
[04:41.760 --> 04:46.380]  We're obviously ice melt. That's that's a huge pain in the ass. You're draining your fridge once a day, right?
[04:47.400 --> 04:49.400]  It's crazy
[04:49.400 --> 04:59.040]  But we take it for granted. I have a new appreciation for the goddamn refrigerator. Yeah. Well, I'll trade you problems. I
[04:59.040 --> 05:04.520]  Don't know. Yeah. Oh, I would trade you in a heartbeat. You could have my toilet and my
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.840]  Well, do I have to start from scratch or do I start from where you are now?
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.840]  I just start from where I am now and and you start from where I am cuz like I feel like I'm I'm near in the
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.320]  End. Oh, you could I'll go back to the beginning of yours all the way. I don't know. I don't know
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.600]  I had I had a lot of 8 a.m. Wake-up calls for this John the service people try and come at 8 a.m
[05:25.280 --> 05:27.280]  You wouldn't like that. Ah
[05:27.320 --> 05:34.480]  You know I had I had 8 a.m. Follow-up with my surgeon. All right. All right. So what's the difference?
[05:34.760 --> 05:37.300]  So here's the thing. I got to talk about it. So
[05:37.820 --> 05:41.880]  because it's gonna come out within the next week because I'm missing the Apple event so a week ago I
[05:41.880 --> 05:47.120]  Suffered a detached retina in my left eye, which is not good
[05:49.200 --> 05:55.440]  This that's like a you can't see type of situation they're supposed to say just to stay attached. All right, so that was
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.640]  Tuesday
[05:57.640 --> 06:03.160]  Wednesday one day later. I had surgery at the Wills Eye Hospital right here in Philadelphia
[06:05.520 --> 06:07.880]  And ours on Yelp five stars
[06:07.880 --> 06:14.620]  They do advertise themselves as the world's finest eye hospital. So I've got that going for me
[06:16.960 --> 06:18.440]  But the
[06:18.440 --> 06:25.120]  This is not a a quick recovery. This is a long slow recovery and in the procedure that I had involves a
[06:26.440 --> 06:28.040]  gas bubble
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.400]  injected in the back of my eye that that
[06:30.400 --> 06:37.280]  It holds the repaired retina in place. So like right in front of the guy went in
[06:37.280 --> 06:39.280]  He repaired my retina
[06:39.280 --> 06:40.600]  then
[06:40.600 --> 06:45.840]  At the very end of this procedure, they put a gas bubble back there and that's crazy, right?
[06:45.840 --> 06:50.820]  I mean it you told me this it's it's when they told me I thought they were making it up
[06:52.040 --> 06:57.840]  It's like a little guy is pushing the retina all the time though, right a little bubble a little bubble
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.120]  But it's like it's like you got a little dude in there. Just keeping everything in place. Yeah, keeping it in place
[07:02.120 --> 07:05.120]  So it is I was very confused at first
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.400]  I I thought it was that they were saying that it was like a sack or like a balloon filled with gas or something
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.560]  And then I thought this sucks cuz then you know, obviously at some point
[07:14.560 --> 07:18.360]  I'm gonna have to go back and they're gonna have to take this thing out. But no, it's just a gas bubble
[07:18.360 --> 07:21.360]  They just inject the gas and my eye will naturally
[07:21.360 --> 07:28.520]  Absorb it over the course of six to ten weeks and it will shrink it'll shrink in my field of vision
[07:29.560 --> 07:31.560]  but anyway long story short
[07:32.240 --> 07:34.240]  one of the one of the
[07:35.520 --> 07:38.480]  Results of this is that while I have this gas bubble in my eye
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.440]  I cannot step foot on an airplane or at least I can't step foot in an airplane that is up in the air
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.880]  And you're probably not supposed to climb mountains. No, I well that's record recommended against
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.200]  Okay
[07:50.200 --> 07:55.960]  Altitude changes. So another way it was explained to me is absolutely positively. No, no airplanes
[07:56.960 --> 07:59.640]  If you can avoid it, don't go to the Poconos or anything like that
[08:00.400 --> 08:01.860]  Okay
[08:01.860 --> 08:07.820]  What about Denver or like well, I would ever I would presume if if the Poconos are are out Denver
[08:07.820 --> 08:09.820]  We Denver's definitely Denver's definitely out
[08:10.840 --> 08:16.040]  And you know, how would I get to Denver and you know, I'd have to be a long drive long drive. Yeah
[08:16.040 --> 08:23.560]  So I will miss the Apple event which is seven we're recording right now on Monday March 2nd seven days from now
[08:23.560 --> 08:28.800]  I will not be able to to make that but they got a live stream. Yeah, I hope so. I don't know
[08:28.800 --> 08:30.400]  It'll be weird. It's sort of like the old days
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.400]  I mean, it's you know, at least for the first half of the run at daring fireball
[08:34.400 --> 08:38.560]  I never went to the press events. So I got it back out
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.360]  Unfortunately of the wool conference too, which is at the end of the month. I said you should just cruise over to Ireland
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.040]  Yeah, that would be the option. So that that conference is in Ireland
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.260]  I guess my only I think that would be my only option would be to to cruise there. I looked it up
[08:55.260 --> 08:59.280]  I think it's like an eight-day each way cruise, which you would have to do and
[08:59.960 --> 09:05.800]  I don't know that they run them until like April or May because it's pretty cold out there right now
[09:06.040 --> 09:08.560]  Right because it wouldn't even be enough to get to
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.440]  England because you know you think you know
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.600]  like when you're booking flights to Ireland or something like that if it goes through Heathrow or something you don't really give it any second
[09:17.600 --> 09:19.160]  thought because it's like
[09:19.160 --> 09:25.340]  It like a 15-minute flight, you know, I mean, right, but if you can't get in an airplane, you know
[09:25.340 --> 09:27.800]  like the difference between England and Ireland is actually
[09:28.760 --> 09:31.060]  Pretty significant. It's decent. Yeah
[09:31.800 --> 09:37.880]  Like it never really it never really matters when you're flying everywhere that Ireland is actually, you know an island
[09:37.880 --> 09:42.000]  But once you can't get in a plane, yes, it's better. Well
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.100]  So you've you've had to bail on you're bailing on the watch event. Unfortunately, you're bailing on this conference
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.960]  Yeah, are you are you just in a bed? What do you have to do? Do they let you walk around?
[09:53.060 --> 09:57.760]  Yeah, I am allowed, you know, obviously, I mean there's been no disruption on
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.840]  During fireball I
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.480]  Even I was posting it was so it's just weird with the way modern anesthesia works. It's just crazy
[10:07.480 --> 10:09.380]  It's like at
[10:09.380 --> 10:13.340]  Eleven o'clock. I was high as a kite. They didn't fully put me under
[10:14.200 --> 10:16.960]  Which is terrifying and I know like for anybody who's out there
[10:16.960 --> 10:22.120]  It sounds absolutely positively terrifying that you're awake for some kind of operation on your eye
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.440]  But you're poking at your eye. You're so far out of it
[10:26.480 --> 10:31.700]  That it it really I actually found it to be rather enjoyable like and and modern
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.840]  anesthesia
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.200]  You know, I've had unfortunately, you know more of it than I would like lately
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.520]  They've really gotten good at making not just putting you under not just making sure that you're out or whatever
[10:45.520 --> 10:47.760]  But actually like making your mood
[10:49.280 --> 10:56.040]  Euphoric like these guys during or after during okay, like when you're in the operating room they at least
[10:56.560 --> 10:58.560]  with the fine
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.800]  Anesthesiologists at Wills Eye Hospital
[11:00.800 --> 11:07.520]  You you feel good. So now you're kind of wishing that they had to go back in there and pull this little sack out
[11:08.040 --> 11:10.040]  Well, no, I wouldn't go that far
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.520]  Wasn't that good. No, it wasn't that good
[11:14.320 --> 11:16.320]  But there were moments when I was you know
[11:17.600 --> 11:24.320]  Sort of kind of they're like aware of my what I was going on and I have to say it was sort of a euphoria
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.440]  It was it was a very good feeling but I so the procedure was like an hour long or so
[11:29.440 --> 11:35.840]  You know, so 11 to 12. I'm in there. They're operating. I'm out of it for the most part but not unconscious but
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.800]  And there were moments where I could hear my surgeon talking
[11:41.360 --> 11:47.940]  And you know, it was bizarre it's it's but it's you're so high so crazy crazy high
[11:48.400 --> 11:50.400]  It you know
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.040]  Do you remember anything? He said like should he should he be careful about what he's saying when he's working on you?
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.520]  Yeah, obviously I'm at one point he was talking about some kind of fold and it was very very clear to me
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.800]  And he was it was a very reassuring. It was it was like
[12:05.320 --> 12:08.480]  he an air of competence and
[12:08.840 --> 12:16.340]  Okay, precision that was inspiring but it was he was and he was clearly talking to his fellow like
[12:18.300 --> 12:20.400]  You know, I don't know if they call him resident anymore
[12:20.400 --> 12:24.920]  They call them fellows but in other words a young doctor who's like his padawan effect
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.200]  Okay, his practice. It was clear that he wasn't talking to anybody else in the ER. He certainly wasn't talking to me
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.240]  He was talking to his
[12:32.840 --> 12:34.840]  fellow
[12:35.120 --> 12:37.120]  And it was something about a
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.360]  Fold like in the corner or something something something fold and that you don't want to do it like that
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.720]  You want to do it like this and it was you know
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.140]  Super bait did they give you like a little I talked did they do a little work while you were under?
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.600]  No, no the retina. It was definitely about the retina
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.760]  It was all right at the some part of the torn proportion of the retina
[12:56.760 --> 12:59.840]  I don't know that it was folded under I don't know something about a fold
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.140]  I don't know. Maybe they throw in a little plastic surgery while you're under
[13:04.120 --> 13:06.800]  Well, I don't know if so, that didn't really help me much
[13:09.080 --> 13:12.360]  But anyway, so you were out and then and then you're back to work
[13:13.180 --> 13:19.040]  By 3 o'clock. I'm you know, I like noon 11 to 11 to noon is like my surgery
[13:19.040 --> 13:26.140]  You know 1230 or so is when I remember seeing Amy in the recovery room
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.880]  You know, so apparently I was still out for maybe a half hour after the procedure was over and
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.940]  I was definitely, you know unsteady not right, you know, it's good. It's a good thing that they made they make you have like a
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.440]  They don't sign you out on your own like Amy
[13:43.440 --> 13:50.000]  Yeah, yeah, um, but we literally I mean this is I mean obviously this whole situation is a
[13:50.680 --> 13:53.720]  very unfortunate run of bad luck, but there's all sorts of
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.560]  it's mixed in with little bits of
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.760]  Good luck
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.960]  Like just by pure coincidence. We certainly didn't pick our house because of it
[14:02.960 --> 14:08.720]  But we literally live four blocks away from Wills Eye Hospital. It's less than a five-minute walk
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.640]  It isn't we live incredibly close. So we walked home, you know, and did you walk there and back? Yeah
[14:15.360 --> 14:21.040]  All right. I mean, it's we lives. It's so close that it wouldn't there's no better way to do it, right?
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.080]  You know if the way if it were raining or something, I guess we could take a cab, you know
[14:25.080 --> 14:27.440]  But it would it would make zero sense to drive. I
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.920]  Mean, there's I mean, I think some people you know, they do have a parking garage
[14:31.920 --> 14:34.240]  so it would be closer than our house, but it's I
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.720]  Think by the time you waited for the elevator in the parking garage and it's all said and done
[14:38.720 --> 14:41.960]  It probably takes about the same amount of time to walk in the front door as it does for my house
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.760]  So we walked home and by like three o'clock I was writing and reading
[14:47.400 --> 14:53.120]  Working during fireball. It's crazy. But now what day was this? Cuz maybe we should look at this and yeah, maybe that was
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.440]  Wednesday, so it would have been Wednesday. It's the 25th. I think yeah, I
[14:59.440 --> 15:06.080]  I love to check and see if it if any of it makes sense. That did actually occur to me
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.640]  Maybe I should maybe I shouldn't have done
[15:10.680 --> 15:13.160]  Were there any odd posts on Wednesday? I don't know
[15:13.920 --> 15:16.000]  Let me see here. I'm scrolling down
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.920]  Uh, I don't think so. It looks pretty normal
[15:22.960 --> 15:25.160]  All right, they do give you a piece of paper
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.480]  I think I sent this to you because I knew that you would enjoy it. Yeah, here's Wednesday. I
[15:29.880 --> 15:32.600]  Don't think I was very busy here. Got far had managed you
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.120]  Google plans new headquarters
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.240]  Yeah, I think it was you know was obviously I was not a prolific but
[15:43.520 --> 15:46.840]  You know, I could read and write. All right
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.080]  What were we saying or is it I
[15:52.080 --> 15:55.960]  Were just talking about how you've got a you know, you got a bail on this stuff
[15:55.960 --> 15:58.160]  But and I'm sharp as a tack that there's no long-term
[15:59.080 --> 16:01.240]  repercussions of the sedatives that they had me
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.000]  You know, I mean it's the basics just though when they first told me that though
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.080]  I I you know, you hear what you want to hear and my thought is well
[16:08.560 --> 16:12.400]  You know, I'm not supposed to fly but I guess I can still do it. But no, it's not like
[16:12.960 --> 16:19.360]  You know, maybe you shouldn't fly. This is you you go blind if you fly. Yeah, I hear gas bubble in the eye
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.480]  I think probably probably don't want to change my my elevation too much. Yeah
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.120]  Well, you know like when you take a sealed bag of chips on a plane like you buy it at the airport
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.320]  You buy a bag of chips and you take them on the plane and then when you open it up mid-flight
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.760]  It's puffed out like a balloon because you can change an air pressure. You don't want that in your eyeball
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.560]  No, that would I mean, I think that's exactly what would happen. I'm not sure that my eye would burst but
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.040]  It's it doesn't seem like it's out of the question. I
[16:46.040 --> 16:51.640]  I wouldn't risk it. It would be like that. What was that stupid commercial where the guy was like
[16:53.160 --> 16:58.400]  The guy's getting on an airplane and it's like his back hurts and he's oh it's like a Tylenol or something commercial
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.600]  Yeah, no, but she's like we have aspirin and he goes aspirin. I'm not having not having a heart attack
[17:03.760 --> 17:06.560]  I'm not having a heart attack my back hurts. I
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.600]  Think that guy was a real racist, don't you?
[17:12.520 --> 17:14.520]  Why why a racist
[17:14.520 --> 17:20.500]  Because it was clearly an international flight and she was I think I think was a Japanese airline and she's
[17:20.920 --> 17:23.720]  He's talking to her as if like she doesn't understand English
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.400]  Like no, no, I'm not having a heart attack. It's my back. She's like, yeah dumbass. Here's some aspirin
[17:31.400 --> 17:37.520]  I didn't read it to that. I just got that like at bear they've had a meeting where they've been so successful
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.200]  With this, you know the way that the aspirin is now prescriber, you know
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.720]  Like if people over a certain age is supposed to pop one aspirin a day and it just somehow
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.840]  Reasons they you know don't understand don't really know but they just clinical studies show if pop an aspirin a day
[17:52.840 --> 17:59.960]  There's less chance of heart attack or something. I guess it's something like that. But you know aspirin I've read about it a while ago
[17:59.960 --> 18:05.480]  Like nobody really has any idea how aspirin works like aspirin was just some because it's ancient, you know, we're not right, right?
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.520]  It's like 5,000 years old. We just know it works. I don't even know if it's 5,000 but it's you know
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.960]  It certainly was was widely used like, you know in the 1800s or at the end of the 1800s
[18:13.960 --> 18:18.880]  And and you know, it was like in the snake oil era and it was something that actually did work
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.880]  You know, it does actually decrease pain
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.840]  But I
[18:24.840 --> 18:25.440]  You know
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.920]  You just know the meeting that they had where they're like well now everybody's forgotten that you can take aspirin for pain relief. Nobody's forgotten
[18:33.080 --> 18:35.200]  No one thinks it's only for a heart attack
[18:35.200 --> 18:42.040]  Well, could you imagine can you imagine like hitting that little thing to call the flight attendant ding and come by?
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.040]  I'm holding my eye and I'm like, do you have any aspirin my my eyeball just burst?
[18:49.760 --> 18:56.920]  Is it in your hand or is it what are you picturing I'm picturing just like a water balloon that pops like it's just gone
[18:56.920 --> 19:02.040]  It's just gone and I've just and maybe a couple wet naps to clean up around. Yeah
[19:02.040 --> 19:04.040]  Oh
[19:04.060 --> 19:09.580]  Also, can you imagine like if you know if you somebody was sitting next to me and
[19:10.800 --> 19:18.100]  Having to apologize because your your eyeball just burst all over them. Well, you just hold the air sick bag up to your face. Yeah, I
[19:19.080 --> 19:21.080]  guess
[19:21.980 --> 19:25.420]  Well, anyway, I'm not gonna find out good plan good plan
[19:25.420 --> 19:31.180]  All right, 1853 is when we discovered aspirin I thought it was older than that
[19:31.180 --> 19:35.820]  Yeah, I knew it wasn't ancient, but I knew it was like, you know, like a Wild West you're a you know
[19:35.820 --> 19:41.540]  right discovery and it just it's crazy because I don't I it might be the one and only medical treatment from
[19:41.900 --> 19:43.900]  1853 that it's still in here
[19:49.420 --> 19:53.060]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor why not
[19:53.060 --> 19:59.740]  Since we're talking about eyeballs. Why not? Talk about our good friends at Warby Parker. Yes, is it really it is
[20:01.260 --> 20:03.260]  Oh, it's a jackpot
[20:05.020 --> 20:08.540]  Go on I'm sorry our next sponsor by the way is bear
[20:09.820 --> 20:14.440]  No, it's our good friends at Warby Parker. You guys know Warby Parker
[20:14.440 --> 20:19.860]  This is where you go online and you buy eyeglasses and they've got a whole bunch of cool styles to pick from
[20:19.860 --> 20:25.320]  Really great prices the whole idea is that the guys who founded the company, you know
[20:25.320 --> 20:30.320]  They're like, how come eyeglasses cost like $800 when you go to like a place to get good-looking eyeglasses
[20:30.320 --> 20:32.320]  Well, guess what? They don't have to
[20:33.200 --> 20:35.600]  Warby Parker's progressives start at
[20:36.360 --> 20:38.360]  295 including frames
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.280]  It's for the the older people out there
[20:41.460 --> 20:46.900]  Who've got your distance prescription at the top and a transition to a reading lens near the bottom
[20:46.900 --> 20:51.580]  To 95 that's unheard of it's way less than what you'd pay at the retail places
[20:53.740 --> 21:00.500]  They use what's called a digital freeform lens, which is the most advanced progressive technology
[21:00.500 --> 21:06.180]  It's applied digitally with a computer. So the design is far more precise than traditional models of progressives
[21:07.140 --> 21:12.020]  It also provides a larger field of vision. So it's just it looks better
[21:12.020 --> 21:14.660]  You don't see the line between the lenses like you used to in the old days
[21:14.660 --> 21:18.840]  And it gives you a better bigger field of vision
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.620]  The other big thing that Warby Parker does huge
[21:22.620 --> 21:27.680]  This is absolutely huge every time you buy a pair of prescriptions glasses from Warby Parker
[21:27.900 --> 21:31.360]  They send a pair to someone in need around the world
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.060]  millions and millions of people around the world who don't have access to
[21:37.740 --> 21:39.740]  You know corrective vision
[21:40.060 --> 21:41.820]  huge problem
[21:41.820 --> 21:46.700]  Just imagine if everything you went around you couldn't see anything sharply terrible
[21:47.260 --> 21:52.460]  Well, guess what Warby Parker is helping to solve that because every time you buy glasses from them
[21:52.460 --> 21:54.460]  They send one to someone in need
[21:55.780 --> 21:59.100]  Here's the crazy thing I know it's when I first heard about Warby Parker years ago
[21:59.100 --> 22:04.260]  I thought well this sounds great, but I how in the world you gonna buy glasses something that you're gonna wear like every single day
[22:05.460 --> 22:07.460]  Something that goes right on your face
[22:07.460 --> 22:12.940]  Without trying them on first like even if you look at the web page and you say well those look cool
[22:12.940 --> 22:14.220]  But how do you know they're gonna look on you?
[22:14.220 --> 22:18.980]  I mean, it's crazy like every time I've ever bought glasses, you know, even right there in the store
[22:18.980 --> 22:23.420]  You look at some you say well those look cool. Then you try them on you're like, wow, I look like an idiot in these
[22:24.660 --> 22:30.280]  They have a great try at home program you pick like I think it's up to five you get five five picks
[22:30.500 --> 22:33.580]  Find five that you think you like pick pick a variety
[22:33.580 --> 22:37.900]  They send them to you without the lenses, you know, the corrective lenses at first
[22:38.540 --> 22:40.540]  Send them to you at home
[22:40.540 --> 22:44.860]  you try them take a couple days ask your friends ask your
[22:45.740 --> 22:48.980]  You know friends and family which ones they like take a look in the mirror
[22:49.740 --> 22:54.780]  And then you pick the one you like the best you send the whole thing back to them. It's all pre shipping
[22:54.780 --> 22:56.060]  It's all pre labeled, you know
[22:56.060 --> 22:59.260]  You don't have to do any kind of work other than just hand it off back to the UPS guy
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.940]  and
[23:00.940 --> 23:05.860]  Boom like a couple days later your glasses brand new glasses come with the actual lenses
[23:06.580 --> 23:08.300]  Could not be easier
[23:08.300 --> 23:12.500]  We I don't even I've lost count of how many Warby Parker glasses
[23:12.500 --> 23:15.540]  We've got laying around the house now between between me and Amy
[23:16.100 --> 23:18.100]  Great great stuff. They do sunglasses
[23:19.980 --> 23:24.740]  All sorts of styles to pick from really could not be easier it's a it's a great thing
[23:25.500 --> 23:28.920]  Once people once you start buying glasses from Warby Parker, you're not gonna go back
[23:28.920 --> 23:33.120]  Where do you go to find out more go to their website Warby Parker?
[23:33.880 --> 23:35.640]  calm
[23:35.640 --> 23:41.480]  slash the talk show and then you'll know that they'll know that you came from here and
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.120]  Use that code, I think they send you I think it's expedited shipping
[23:47.400 --> 23:54.720]  You'll give you free three-day shipping on your glasses if you use that that code Warby Parker calm
[23:55.680 --> 23:57.680]  slash the talk show I
[23:57.680 --> 24:03.960]  Was hoping I went there I was hoping maybe I could get a designer eyepatch. Oh, I was just looking for monocles
[24:03.960 --> 24:11.080]  They do not sell monocles currently. Yeah, see that's it could be a problem for me if this doesn't I mean a prognosis is good
[24:11.080 --> 24:16.480]  I mean it's and everybody, you know, if anybody I hope I made that clear that you know after this procedure
[24:16.480 --> 24:17.040]  I had last week
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.600]  I went back the next day and they took a look and they said it looks quote unquote great for day one
[24:22.640 --> 24:25.920]  So, you know, I have a good prognosis here. I don't want anybody
[24:25.920 --> 24:28.040]  I'm only I hate even going public with it
[24:28.040 --> 24:31.120]  but I have to because I feel like I have to explain why I'm not at the Apple event and
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.200]  I absolutely have to explain why I won't be speaking as scheduled at all. I
[24:37.960 --> 24:41.800]  Feel like if you just drop out of a speaking event people are gonna think you're a flake, you know
[24:41.800 --> 24:45.840]  And I want people right you got it. You got a pretty good excuse that you'd prefer to keep both your eyeballs
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.720]  Don't know that there's anybody who's that dedicated that they would voluntarily go blind blind in one eye to make it
[24:53.720 --> 24:55.720]  a
[24:56.080 --> 24:59.180]  Really good conference. I've heard good things about all but oh my god
[24:59.180 --> 25:04.000]  Can you imagine how uncomfortable that would be if that was the subject of my talk? I hope you like this talk. I
[25:06.600 --> 25:08.680]  Went blind to be here
[25:09.880 --> 25:13.400]  You get quite a round of applause at the end. No, I think people would feel terrible
[25:13.400 --> 25:18.640]  I think that you everybody I mean because it would it would be such a sign that you're you know mentally ill
[25:18.640 --> 25:26.400]  All right, maybe all right like watching somebody destroy themselves would be terrible
[25:28.560 --> 25:31.880]  All right, I think you made the right call, you know, I mentioned I should go back
[25:31.880 --> 25:35.040]  I'm the worst but with the Warby Parker, you know that
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.380]  The 295 is for the progressives. They're regular ones if you don't need progressives, by the way
[25:40.380 --> 25:45.360]  I just feel obligated to go back and mention this they started just 95 bucks including the lenses
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.120]  So I don't want to leave the impression that you got to pay 300 bucks for for glasses
[25:50.440 --> 25:52.940]  100 bucks get you a high-quality pair of glasses
[25:55.560 --> 25:59.120]  And and anyway what else what's going on I
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.300]  Think there's some kind of a watch coming out. Yeah, what about the
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.000]  Before we talk about that we could talk about the pebble color was is that what it's called called pebble or a little time, right?
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  pebble time
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.600]  Because you know, it's a watch so well and and you I know I have a pebble
[26:18.140 --> 26:22.720]  Which I never really got into wearing. I don't think I ever wore it for more than like a day
[26:24.120 --> 26:30.720]  But I know that you you have a original first gen pebble and you've worn it regularly I did I
[26:31.720 --> 26:34.720]  Stopped wearing it. I think I wore it for two or three months and
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.460]  You know, I bought it
[26:36.460 --> 26:40.920]  I think for the same reason you did just out of curiosity because when the the Kickstarter was announced
[26:40.920 --> 26:43.220]  She's like a year and a half two years ago even
[26:44.320 --> 26:48.040]  it was a curiosity and nothing else like it existed and
[26:48.640 --> 26:53.800]  It was I think what was it about a hundred bucks or so. I think it was a hundred bucks
[26:54.920 --> 26:59.680]  It wasn't outlandish. I mean it wasn't it wasn't much more than that. It might have even been a little less than that and
[27:00.360 --> 27:07.160]  I said, you know, this seems interesting and I think I enjoyed it a little more than you did but it's to me
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.880]  it's it sort of proved the concept of having
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.880]  a watch connected to your phone because I
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.280]  Think even now I think even after the Apple watch comes out people are gonna say, you know
[27:18.280 --> 27:20.760]  What the heck do you need that for you've got your phone, but?
[27:21.680 --> 27:24.160]  When you're driving, it's great. You can glance at your wrist
[27:24.680 --> 27:27.400]  When you're in a meeting when you're you know talking to somebody else
[27:27.400 --> 27:29.400]  It's a whole lot easier to just look at your wrist real quick
[27:29.480 --> 27:32.960]  Then pull out your phone and you know figure out what's going on there
[27:32.960 --> 27:39.880]  and I did find that it was you know, not the most valuable thing in the world, but it was certainly a useful accessory to
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.360]  The phone in a way that without trying it
[27:43.360 --> 27:48.040]  I might not have believed my big one of my big complaints with it my two big complaints
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.600]  I guess were that one I didn't feel like I was getting fine grained enough
[27:53.160 --> 27:55.160]  control over which notifications
[27:55.720 --> 28:01.120]  Like pebble specifically with pebble specifically it was more or less all notifications anything
[28:01.120 --> 28:03.120]  You know you if you pair it with your phone
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.460]  through your iPhone then anything that would be a notification on your phone is a notification on your pebble and I
[28:10.080 --> 28:16.080]  Tend to have my phone set up to not I don't get a lot of notifications period I you know most things I have turned
[28:16.080 --> 28:16.680]  off
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.120]  Yeah, same. I only get email notifications for my VIPs etc. Which is like I
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.720]  Think I was just talking to someone
[28:24.720 --> 28:27.200]  I don't know if it was on the show or where but it it's like one of the
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.120]  Best features apples come up with like a little feature that you take for granted, but but right now you barely even notice
[28:33.120 --> 28:36.960]  But then you know if you stop and think hey, I'm only getting emails from you know
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.880]  My mom and the wife and whoever it's it's very nice. Yeah, but there's so many little things that really
[28:45.520 --> 28:46.440]  Just little
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.880]  Notifications that I do want on my phone
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.920]  But I don't want on my watch and the fact that I couldn't turn them off made it feel like my watch was annoying me
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.720]  Now was that I think that's how it was initially
[28:55.720 --> 28:58.240]  I think eventually I you know, I stopped using it as well
[28:58.240 --> 29:00.760]  but I think eventually you did get a little more fine-grained control as
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.380]  Far as some things that would notify on the phone only and not on the not
[29:05.380 --> 29:09.320]  Yeah, maybe and this you know, I might be speaking from old experience, you know
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.960]  but maybe it's but it just
[29:10.960 --> 29:17.200]  But I also did not I also found it that the physical sensation of the vibration to be unpleasant even for things
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.800]  I wanted the pebble to notify me about like a text message, right?
[29:20.800 --> 29:26.200]  I get text messages is one that I would think anybody wants, you know, my wife texts me I want that
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.600]  I do want it on my watch if if my watch is going to show me anything
[29:29.600 --> 29:35.520]  That's something I would want. I found the vibration to be physically unpleasant not like in a big way, but
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.240]  In it never once made me happy that my watch buzz
[29:39.840 --> 29:47.040]  Well, so you've you've tried on an Apple watch right and and you and they showed you the the Taptic sensor, right?
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.000]  I have to feedback so
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.160]  You can compare the two I've I have not yeah, it's a completely different sensation
[29:53.160 --> 29:57.200]  I've said this before but it's it's not the Taptic thing, you know
[29:57.200 --> 30:01.460]  And I know that Taptic is a word that they've made up, you know that it's tap plus haptic
[30:01.460 --> 30:05.520]  But it it's really is a kind of great name
[30:05.520 --> 30:11.040]  Like I'm sure they get some point once they had the thing working and somebody said Taptic everybody in the room
[30:11.040 --> 30:17.160]  I'm sure it was like that's it because it does feel like it's tapping you and it's not at all like a vibration
[30:17.160 --> 30:22.800]  You know a phone vibrator. It sounds it sounds weird. I mean it is weird
[30:22.800 --> 30:25.360]  It's different but it's it's not unpleasant
[30:25.360 --> 30:28.800]  it's and it to me solves a very real problem that the
[30:29.160 --> 30:35.040]  At least the original pebble definitely had which is that of a little the vibrating engine vibration motor
[30:35.040 --> 30:37.700]  Yeah, right are just not pleasant sensation
[30:38.080 --> 30:44.320]  Well, so I the thing to me about the new one the the pebble time was it looks very nice
[30:44.320 --> 30:50.680]  And it's interesting to me that it's gonna be one of the first devices out there using a color e-ink display
[30:51.200 --> 30:55.800]  Because none of the you know, like the nooks and and the Kindles are all still black and white e-ink
[30:56.480 --> 31:02.760]  but it seems very much geared at Android users because they just can't get the level of
[31:04.000 --> 31:10.700]  You know connection to the system on iOS that they want right and I think that's sort of unfortunate because it'd be nice if there
[31:10.700 --> 31:12.320]  were competitors
[31:12.320 --> 31:17.960]  That worked with the iPhone, but I think it's I think if they're carving out a niche in the market
[31:17.960 --> 31:19.780]  It's it's on the Android side
[31:19.780 --> 31:23.840]  Yeah, even though I think the original one I think probably was Laura
[31:23.840 --> 31:28.080]  I maybe it was even iPhone first right wasn't it like that their Android software took a while
[31:28.640 --> 31:35.800]  It's definitely yeah, that sounds right. All right, I think that that because of the enthusiasts market and the Kickstarter market
[31:36.600 --> 31:40.720]  Especially from from a couple years ago when Kickstarter was you know?
[31:40.720 --> 31:44.480]  A little bit less well known, you know, it was definitely the iPhone
[31:44.480 --> 31:49.480]  I think made up a much bigger part of their market right, but I think it's inevitable
[31:49.480 --> 31:52.860]  I think you're exactly right though there right now. It's inevitable because they need
[31:53.440 --> 31:58.400]  They crave more control on the phone and the iPhone just doesn't offer it
[31:59.080 --> 32:05.560]  well, and I think so, I think that's it's interesting because in this space Apple's making a device and
[32:05.560 --> 32:11.120]  You know Apple's answer is going to be get the Apple watch. That's the one that works best with the iPhone
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.440]  but I got a
[32:13.480 --> 32:19.360]  Doorbell, I got a doorbell called the ring and it's a video doorbell and it connects to your phone
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.440]  It's great. It rings your phone wherever you are when somebody's at the door
[32:23.440 --> 32:27.760]  So if you're not at home or you know, whatever you can tell UPS guy to leave a package, whatever
[32:28.120 --> 32:32.800]  but the biggest issue that I have with it is that I keep my phone on silent most of the time and
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.800]  on the iPhone the only thing that can override the silent switch is your alarm clock and
[32:38.520 --> 32:41.860]  If I could have one other thing do it, it would be this doorbell
[32:42.560 --> 32:49.880]  Because I want that notification anytime that it happens and it's something where I don't think Apple's likely to ever make a doorbell
[32:50.400 --> 32:55.920]  but because the system is locked down enough, it means that nobody else can make one that has that level of
[32:56.840 --> 33:01.480]  Access right and you know, you see it with the watch you see it with with a bunch of things and it's I think in this
[33:01.480 --> 33:05.880]  case, you know, there's an answer it's get an Apple watch and that'll have all the
[33:06.400 --> 33:11.120]  Authority that you need but in a lot of other cases, I think there's sort of missed opportunities right now
[33:12.120 --> 33:19.640]  Yeah, I think it's you know, it's an unfortunate side effect, you know of and I don't think it's purely I think it plays into it
[33:19.640 --> 33:21.640]  I mean, let's face it. There's a little bit of
[33:22.760 --> 33:24.480]  competitive spite
[33:24.480 --> 33:31.680]  So do your doorbell thing you can like if you're away you can then use an app or something to talk through the intercom
[33:31.720 --> 33:37.040]  yeah, so it's it's the whole thing is it's got a little video camera and it's got a battery and
[33:38.320 --> 33:40.720]  They ring the doorbell just like you ring a normal doorbell
[33:40.720 --> 33:46.080]  but then it rings on your phone and you accept the call and you can see them they can't see you but
[33:46.600 --> 33:48.880]  it's you know, so the the
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.720]  The their angle is a security angle that I guess a lot of breaking and entering is the very first thing they do is ring
[33:54.720 --> 33:56.760]  The doorbell to make sure nobody's home. Hmm
[33:56.760 --> 34:00.800]  And with this you can your home no matter where you are is sort of the way they pitch it
[34:02.200 --> 34:04.200]  You know, it's it's not necessarily the
[34:05.120 --> 34:11.160]  yeah, I'm not necessarily that interested in that aspect of it, but it is nice to have a little intercom without needing to run a
[34:11.160 --> 34:13.160]  whole bunch of wires and
[34:13.480 --> 34:15.000]  It's great except for like I said
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.920]  If I've got my phone on silent or if I've got it on do not disturb and somebody
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.060]  Wants to deliver a package at 8 in the morning, and I've got my phone set up to not bother me
[34:23.720 --> 34:25.720]  Suddenly the doorbell doesn't ring
[34:25.880 --> 34:33.080]  Which is sort of unfortunate, right? Yeah, and like the way that the alarm app can override that is is
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.580]  Black magic because the it's only the built-in system
[34:38.840 --> 34:43.420]  Alarm, you know clock app that has the ability to go outside the you know
[34:43.420 --> 34:45.420]  the
[34:47.500 --> 34:50.980]  Privileges, you know, like I don't think there's I'm 99% sure
[34:50.980 --> 34:54.860]  There's no way that any third-party alarm clock app. No, I can do those things
[34:54.860 --> 34:58.340]  I think they're all at a bit a bit of a disadvantage because of that but
[34:59.020 --> 35:04.300]  You know in that case again, the built-in alarm clock app is pretty good. It's decent
[35:05.180 --> 35:07.820]  But yeah for other stuff. There's there's just no way around it
[35:07.820 --> 35:13.400]  Yeah, that's a perfect example though of the and of the sort of thing that you just don't think about right and it's you know
[35:13.400 --> 35:15.100]  in the way that like
[35:15.100 --> 35:20.900]  You know Apple isn't trying to build everything right? I mean, they've only you know, that watches their first new products
[35:20.900 --> 35:27.700]  You know in five years, you know, they're just they're not building thermostats and doorbells and security cameras and etc, etc
[35:27.700 --> 35:29.700]  and you know somebody else is and
[35:30.620 --> 35:32.460]  once you you know
[35:32.460 --> 35:37.140]  Sit there and think well how if we reinvented the doorbell, what would we do and you start thinking of cool things?
[35:37.140 --> 35:41.900]  You could do with notifications and apps and you know Wi-Fi. I guess you have it on your Wi-Fi, right? Yeah
[35:41.900 --> 35:44.420]  Yeah, it's brilliant. It's really clever. I like that
[35:44.940 --> 35:49.380]  It is and it's but it's it's something where I don't necessarily have that much
[35:49.380 --> 35:54.720]  Hope that this will change but it's something where I think if you get enough of these types of products where they do need these
[35:55.020 --> 35:59.900]  Higher privileges, you know higher access to the system and I'm willing to give it to it
[35:59.900 --> 36:04.300]  That's really the thing is I want the app to be able to say no matter what you get to ring
[36:04.380 --> 36:07.300]  Yeah, I almost feel like it's almost at this point
[36:07.300 --> 36:12.100]  it's almost like it would be confused but I could see it like I would like to give this app a
[36:12.580 --> 36:16.100]  Get out of do not disturb, you know privilege, right?
[36:16.100 --> 36:19.660]  And and yeah, you don't want to do you don't want to have games asking for this
[36:19.660 --> 36:22.620]  You don't want to have I don't even know most things asking for this
[36:22.620 --> 36:28.300]  But I can look at this as a user and say this thing should have it and I would bet that there's you know
[36:28.300 --> 36:36.060]  a half dozen types of these products that could use the levels of access that the alarm clock alarm clock app have right and
[36:36.060 --> 36:39.540]  You know, I like I said, I don't hold out a whole lot of hope that that'll ever happen
[36:39.540 --> 36:45.260]  but I certainly hope that these people are talking to Apple and saying look you're not gonna make this and we're trying to make it
[36:45.260 --> 36:46.140]  as as
[36:46.140 --> 36:48.700]  Top quality and experience for your users as we can
[36:49.420 --> 36:52.580]  And I think I think on Android there's at least you know
[36:52.580 --> 36:54.700]  I don't have enough experience with it to say they could definitely do this
[36:54.700 --> 37:01.140]  But there's definitely more flexibility and more access on that side where you know, we just don't have it on the iPhone. Yeah
[37:01.140 --> 37:09.340]  With pebble, I never really wrote about it on during fireball because I always felt a little bad and I often I'll complain about other
[37:09.340 --> 37:14.660]  People grading somebody on a curve or something and I don't feel it's quite that way because I like the idea of pebble
[37:14.660 --> 37:16.940]  I like that. They seem like a good company
[37:17.860 --> 37:20.620]  I'm rooting for them and I really felt bad
[37:20.620 --> 37:24.460]  Like I just didn't I couldn't get myself to just really write about it
[37:24.460 --> 37:27.560]  Because if I were gonna write about it, I'd have to be honest and if I were honest
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.060]  It would be a very negative review and I just didn't want to do it
[37:32.060 --> 37:35.860]  You know, I'd rather say nothing than you know
[37:36.380 --> 37:38.380]  Because so you get on the podcast
[37:38.540 --> 37:42.580]  Exactly, and I feel like that's sort of the fun thing about having a podcast. It's is a little bit
[37:43.460 --> 37:47.660]  You know, like I can use the intonation of my voice and and it conveys it
[37:47.660 --> 37:53.620]  I think I think everybody listening to this can kind of knows what I'm saying, right? It's absolutely it's easier to be
[37:54.140 --> 37:55.460]  I
[37:55.460 --> 37:58.260]  Put some emotion into it maybe to put a better way
[37:58.260 --> 38:01.060]  So I bought I signed up for the new one too, even though I don't
[38:01.820 --> 38:07.600]  Expect not to like it either but I like them enough that I got the cheapest pebble time that I could
[38:07.900 --> 38:12.980]  you know, I looked at it and I thought it's so close to the Apple watch and
[38:13.580 --> 38:14.840]  I'm interested in it
[38:14.840 --> 38:20.840]  But it doesn't seem like there's any real benefit to getting it ahead of time if I were a consumer just a pure consumer
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.860]  I would not have done bought it. I feel like for whatever I paid for the
[38:24.860 --> 38:26.860]  200 bucks or whatever
[38:27.100 --> 38:29.100]  I can I can
[38:29.580 --> 38:33.300]  It's a perfectly valid business expense. Yeah, it's cost of doing business for you. Absolutely
[38:33.820 --> 38:40.540]  well, the thing to me was that again it seemed very clear that the Android experience for this was going to be superior to the
[38:40.540 --> 38:42.500]  iOS experience and
[38:42.500 --> 38:47.920]  Because Apple is now making a watch. They're not going to be inclined to make it any better for pebble
[38:48.580 --> 38:51.900]  So it that to me scared me off of it a little bit
[38:51.900 --> 38:55.660]  I was also interested that they did another Kickstarter on this. Yeah, I thought that was
[38:56.220 --> 38:59.740]  Yeah, I thought it well, yeah, cuz I bought it from their Kickstarter, right?
[38:59.740 --> 39:04.860]  But I mean just the I think it was two or three years ago Kickstarter had a blog post and it said Kickstarter is not
[39:04.860 --> 39:08.660]  A store. Yeah, that was the headline of a blog post, right and
[39:09.740 --> 39:14.540]  Now this product I think it's supposed to ship it in May which is two months from now
[39:15.620 --> 39:17.620]  Kickstarter is a store for this product
[39:17.620 --> 39:22.340]  Yeah, totally. I mean, there's there's no other way to look at this then that
[39:22.900 --> 39:25.980]  You're buying this and in two months, you'll have it and you're not really
[39:26.500 --> 39:29.380]  You're not backing it to make it come into existence
[39:29.380 --> 39:33.260]  If you don't buy it there, you're gonna be able to buy it somewhere else in two months no matter what
[39:33.260 --> 39:36.880]  So I think they opened this thing six days ago. It was sometime last week
[39:37.180 --> 39:42.260]  It was yeah within the past week or so, although I seem to recall it was before my my incident
[39:42.260 --> 39:46.200]  But anyway, they've already raised 12 million dollars, which is crazy. It's great
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.400]  They wanted they had a five hundred thousand dollar goal, which they knew they were gonna read
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.400]  Yeah, they knew they were gonna blow through that right
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.440]  But they've got 12 million and are they the top?
[39:55.440 --> 40:01.520]  I was looking a few days ago at the top projects and the pebble was like number three and the pebble time was already number
[40:01.520 --> 40:07.560]  four yeah, and the pebble was number one for a long time like right what it was the
[40:08.360 --> 40:11.760]  It had sat at number one for like the longest period of anybody. I
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.960]  Also, like I know that they've hired some people with who were interaction designers for web OS
[40:18.960 --> 40:23.660]  I think maybe all the way back to when it was a palm project, which I've always thought was a great
[40:24.080 --> 40:28.320]  Design for an operating system like without any hesitation
[40:28.320 --> 40:34.500]  I would say this you know second only to iOS and the one with the most ideas that I kind of feel like we're better
[40:34.500 --> 40:35.800]  than iOS
[40:35.800 --> 40:38.800]  And then almost none of them got picked up anywhere. No
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.840]  No, but like the way they did notifications with a thing at the bottom
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.720]  I mean, it's you know, we have it a lot now there, you know, they're like what on iOS we call banners
[40:48.640 --> 40:54.320]  But on the web OS they were at the bottom and they everything was designed from the get-go to support them
[40:54.320 --> 40:59.300]  So whatever was on your interface would shrink to go above it, you know, okay
[41:00.360 --> 41:02.120]  Just all sorts of little things like that
[41:02.120 --> 41:05.360]  Not that that's you know, not that the bottom is that much greater than the top
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.600]  But there was so many little things about web OS that were really nice, you know, and you know
[41:09.600 --> 41:12.840]  A lot of them have come to Android and iOS now, you know
[41:12.840 --> 41:17.880]  the card based interface for switching is right, you know was web OS and they've they've
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.760]  Just looking at the video for the new pebble time. There's so many little bits of
[41:24.040 --> 41:29.920]  Animation I'm impressed. I mean I'm and it looked like it was all straightforward like that
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.940]  They were shooting actual prototypes. Like it wasn't like that. They write it wasn't animated, right? Yeah
[41:35.940 --> 41:37.760]  So that's impressive for e-ink
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.520]  I think and it you know, it just shows it was a glaring weak spot in there
[41:43.080 --> 41:50.280]  1.0 pebble OS the interaction design of that thing was it really felt like like a device from the early 90s
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.120]  No animation
[41:52.120 --> 41:56.340]  everything just sort of jumped from one thing to another right and no real sense of
[41:56.340 --> 42:02.900]  I what would you call it even spatiality? I don't know like place like where am I in the watch?
[42:02.900 --> 42:05.940]  I don't write you were just always looking at whatever was there and then
[42:06.420 --> 42:11.060]  Swiping to a completely new right like wiping the whole screen and getting a new look at it, right?
[42:11.060 --> 42:14.980]  So they've come up with you know, I is it actually going to be useful
[42:14.980 --> 42:19.060]  I don't know but it to me at least it's novel which to me is always impressive
[42:19.060 --> 42:27.180]  and it sounds like it could be good this timeline interface where older stuff is up and future stuff is
[42:27.300 --> 42:28.740]  down and
[42:28.740 --> 42:30.820]  The moment right now is in the middle
[42:31.180 --> 42:35.740]  So if you want to look at what you were doing yesterday you go up and you can see like what was my step count?
[42:35.740 --> 42:36.740]  yesterday
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.780]  I
[42:37.780 --> 42:42.860]  Guess where was I yesterday and if you want to see where you have to go tomorrow you go down and it'll say well
[42:42.860 --> 42:47.020]  Here's you know, here's your schedule for tomorrow and then you hit the middle button and you're back to now
[42:47.020 --> 42:50.380]  Here's the time and what's going on right now. I think yeah
[42:51.700 --> 42:56.620]  I think it was a pretty impressive response because obviously when was the Apple watch announced
[42:57.380 --> 43:02.540]  Last September. Yeah, so I'm presumably they were already working on this
[43:02.540 --> 43:08.740]  but and they you know had a sense that something might be coming from Apple, but then suddenly Apple announces it and
[43:09.180 --> 43:14.140]  They're trying to compete with that obviously as a smartwatch, but it's a very different product
[43:14.140 --> 43:18.940]  They're not they didn't suddenly say, you know what? We better put a touchscreen on there and it's got to be a proper
[43:19.180 --> 43:21.180]  You know LED display
[43:21.340 --> 43:23.340]  or LCD display rather
[43:24.060 --> 43:27.380]  you know they they stuck with what they had which was the e-paper and
[43:27.660 --> 43:32.100]  improved upon that in a way that makes it a different product and not sort of a
[43:32.820 --> 43:39.060]  Direct competitor to the Apple watch. Yeah, definitely. I think if anything if if Apple watches had any influence on
[43:39.060 --> 43:45.160]  This at all. I would guess it's only the timing that maybe that's you know, it lit a fire
[43:45.900 --> 43:49.460]  Yeah, you know that I mean they expect to ship them in May
[43:49.460 --> 43:50.340]  I mean
[43:50.340 --> 43:54.300]  But maybe that was a good and maybe it was really just motivation that knowing that you know
[43:54.300 --> 43:57.820]  when Apple finally decloaked the watch in September and said early
[43:58.740 --> 44:04.480]  2015 that it really motivated the people who work at pebble to let's we've got a ship before they do
[44:04.480 --> 44:11.060]  You know, we are we used to have to announce before they do it's a good motivation, but I would bet though that the design
[44:11.060 --> 44:15.140]  Of this was already largely in place and it certainly is true to the original pebble
[44:16.380 --> 44:21.980]  Vision and that's to me is also why these guys are so interesting to watch is they clearly have a very different
[44:23.860 --> 44:27.460]  Just basic idea for what a little wrist smart
[44:28.220 --> 44:32.920]  Computer would be like then Apple does well and it's much simpler. It's you know, it's
[44:32.920 --> 44:36.840]  Is the the technology inside of it is a lot simpler, which means it's cheaper
[44:36.840 --> 44:40.020]  It means it lasts for what do they say like seven to ten days, I think
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.880]  I know the first one did which was definitely true in my experience. Yeah. Oh, absolutely
[44:44.880 --> 44:47.280]  the first one definitely had good battery life and
[44:48.520 --> 44:55.560]  Apple still hasn't announced an actual battery life, but they're saying charge it every night, right? Right. So that to me is definitely
[44:56.280 --> 44:57.240]  Not a good thing
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.800]  I mean, I don't think it'll affect things too negatively
[44:59.800 --> 45:03.000]  But I'd rather not have to charge a watch every single night, right?
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.320]  It were to know that if you're only going away for an overnight, you know, like just one overnight
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.880]  I'm gonna be in New York, you know for 48 hours that you still have to take your charger, right?
[45:13.880 --> 45:20.200]  And and it's a different charger than everything else you've got. So you've got your charger for your phone and your laptop and now your watch
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.200]  Right, and it's totally understandable. Why I you know
[45:24.200 --> 45:31.280]  Although I wonder like because to me the way forward would be to get the iPhone on the magnetic charger
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.480]  I mean clearly a lightning port is never gonna happen on a watch because it would be horrible
[45:37.440 --> 45:40.240]  But a magnetic charger for the iPhone that I could see that
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.600]  In terms of like decreasing the number of things you have to pack with you
[45:45.600 --> 45:48.920]  But on the other hand like when you travel I always you know
[45:48.920 --> 45:50.840]  I charge my phone right before I go to sleep
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.920]  And so if I have to charge the phone and the watch I still I don't see how you get out of two chargers
[45:55.920 --> 45:59.860]  But at least you maybe you know, you don't have to worry that you've picked the wrong one
[46:00.640 --> 46:06.080]  Right. Well, I guess the the other thing that I sort of don't understand is that there's definitely been talk of using
[46:06.400 --> 46:13.960]  The taptic feedback to wake you up in the morning. No, yeah. Yeah, if you're charging the watch overnight, that's not gonna work, obviously
[46:14.480 --> 46:15.680]  right
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.440]  Yeah, I don't get it. I know Johnny I've I think it was I don't think they talked about it at the event
[46:20.440 --> 46:26.240]  but I think there was some kind of interview with Johnny I've like maybe it was the Vanity Fair conference that he was interviewed at and
[46:26.320 --> 46:28.320]  He mentioned that it's a great
[46:28.520 --> 46:32.540]  Alarm clock and you immediately you heard my guy messaging me like well
[46:35.560 --> 46:37.560]  You'll charge it every night
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.760]  And then you'll remember at 4 in the morning to wake up put it on
[46:41.760 --> 46:48.260]  Yeah, like you have to set your iPhone alarm to remind you. There you go. And fortunately that alarm goes no matter what?
[46:48.260 --> 46:53.680]  So your iPhone alarm will go off. You'll put the watch on and then four hours later. You'll wake up
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.200]  There is some talk I forget where it came out like in the dribs and drabs of stuff that's coming out in the last few weeks
[47:01.400 --> 47:03.160]  There's something that came out of that
[47:03.160 --> 47:04.840]  It might charge very quickly
[47:04.840 --> 47:11.660]  That it won't take all night to charge that it'll charge pretty fast and that might not even be because the charging technology is all
[47:11.660 --> 47:15.440]  That fast but simply that it's such a tiny batteries got a tiny battery, right?
[47:15.440 --> 47:20.600]  Exactly. It can't have that big a battery given how given how big it is, right that maybe like an iPad
[47:21.080 --> 47:23.640]  That was charging at the same rate would take a week
[47:24.080 --> 47:27.440]  But but the watch can charge in half an hour or something like that
[47:27.840 --> 47:33.920]  And did they say anything is the bigger watch gonna have a bigger battery? It must right? I
[47:35.360 --> 47:41.880]  Mean, why wouldn't it I can't imagine that I can't imagine that they would put a smaller battery in it
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.880]  Just so that it has the same
[47:43.880 --> 47:50.120]  You know and and you know, presumably it's going to need the laws of physics would say that right going to need a bigger
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.920]  It's gonna the screens gonna use more energy because it has right
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.600]  So it's not actually the question is is will it have longer battery life, right?
[47:57.600 --> 48:02.800]  Is it like an iPhone 6 6 plus type thing where the bigger one is gonna have noticeably better battery life
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.280]  Or is it the other way around or maybe maybe the extra size of the screen?
[48:08.120 --> 48:12.360]  Eats up all the extra battery that they can fit in there. I don't know. It's a good question
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.000]  I guess we'll see in a week. Maybe yeah, I hadn't really thought about this Chris for whatever reason
[48:18.640 --> 48:24.760]  Selfishly, I had known that if I get one of these I'm gonna want 42 millimeters not the 38 millimeter
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.160]  So I haven't really thought about the 38 millimeter ones and then when it comes to cost I haven't really
[48:29.920 --> 48:35.560]  Like it the game that everybody's playing, you know the last two weeks including me. I'm not pointing figures
[48:35.560 --> 48:42.120]  But you know how much of these things gonna cost I hadn't occurred to me that the 38 millimeter one would cost less
[48:42.760 --> 48:48.040]  Right at any level aluminum steel gold gold. It makes it with the gold, right?
[48:48.320 --> 48:55.840]  Right, because even if the price isn't really based on the price of gold it it there's the illusion that it is right, right?
[48:55.840 --> 48:59.360]  Yeah, so if you if you if they were the same price then somebody's getting something for free
[48:59.920 --> 49:04.960]  Right, right. It feels like it actually feels like you're getting ripped off if they're the same price
[49:04.960 --> 49:07.560]  If you're having the bigger or the smaller one
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.800]  But anyway, we can talk about pricing in a moment. We should but with pebble, I don't know at the bottom line
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.360]  I'm very impressed by what they've showed
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.560]  I don't think I'm gonna like it and I think you're right that maybe it's not even fair because I'm an iPhone user
[49:21.560 --> 49:23.840]  But I'm rude. I'm certainly rooting for them
[49:23.840 --> 49:30.840]  Oh, I think it's I think it's certainly great to have anybody in the space doing something to compete with Apple and doing something different
[49:30.840 --> 49:38.760]  Where hopefully some ideas cross pollinate instead of you know, somebody coming directly head-on and and you're just trying to match features here
[49:38.760 --> 49:40.360]  it's something where
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.360]  pebble has some very different ideas and
[49:42.440 --> 49:47.920]  potentially it changes the way you do things on both platforms and Android where I think one of the things that to me was a
[49:47.920 --> 49:49.720]  little surprising about
[49:49.720 --> 49:56.960]  The when the Apple watch was unveiled in September was how at least at the hardware level
[49:56.960 --> 50:04.020]  It's sort of the same basic idea as Android where right like it's you know a phone type display
[50:04.020 --> 50:07.240]  You know whether it's IPS or whether it's OLED or whatever
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.440]  It sounds like apples is going to be OLED because they want the blacks to you know, they want the deeper blacks
[50:14.200 --> 50:21.100]  But it whatever the actual technology it's a you know, a light up bright color phone display with a touchscreen
[50:21.100 --> 50:27.700]  You know, it's take a take a modern smartphone and shrink it to your watch right at a fundamental level now
[50:27.700 --> 50:32.820]  I think Apple watch is clearly more ambitious than Android where in terms of having apps actually on the watch and
[50:32.860 --> 50:38.920]  Android where is a little bit more about just showing you these cards that are based on your Google now
[50:39.780 --> 50:43.020]  Profile it's more like here's all the stuff. Google knows about you
[50:43.020 --> 50:50.300]  Google knows you have a flight tomorrow because your Gmail adds the flight confirmation from the airline and so they put a card on here and
[50:50.300 --> 50:53.020]  since they know you have a flight and you're going to
[50:54.260 --> 50:59.380]  You know, I know San Francisco then they know to put a card on there that has your weather for San Francisco
[50:59.380 --> 51:03.220]  You know, it's this card based interface, but just at the hardware level, you know, it's this
[51:03.900 --> 51:05.900]  one day of battery life
[51:06.100 --> 51:11.420]  Bluetooth connection to your phone with a bright color screen and well pebble has a very different
[51:12.620 --> 51:14.140]  Take on that with the back
[51:14.140 --> 51:17.420]  I mean the pebbles obviously very different with the with the e-paper with the ink
[51:17.420 --> 51:22.660]  But what what might you have expected Apple to do any differently? I guess I don't know. I you know, I
[51:23.820 --> 51:29.340]  Guess it's not in the digital crown is sort of there. Yes wishing hardware characteristic, right?
[51:29.500 --> 51:35.140]  Absolutely, and and I know that it sounds like a trivial little thing and I pointed this out on Twitter the other day
[51:35.420 --> 51:39.060]  and a whole bunch of like Android people were like
[51:40.140 --> 51:44.100]  Dude, all the Android wear phones have a crown look and now but they don't they have buttons
[51:44.100 --> 51:48.980]  They have a it looks, you know, it's placed where it goes on a watch, you know
[51:48.980 --> 51:51.740]  It's over there in the same place where a dot, you know, a crown is on a watch
[51:51.980 --> 51:54.260]  But on all the Android wear phones that I've seen to date
[51:54.260 --> 51:59.220]  It's just a button that you press to like wake it up or dismiss things or something what I mean that Apple
[51:59.300 --> 52:06.300]  You know has done that is original is the spinning crown and that it's a big part of the interaction of using the device
[52:06.900 --> 52:11.140]  Well, I think they talked about it right that the you know the gesture on the iPad
[52:11.140 --> 52:18.300]  you know ten years ago the the spinning wheel was a big deal and then touch multi touch on the iPhone and now this is
[52:18.300 --> 52:20.300]  sort of the new gesture that
[52:20.960 --> 52:25.740]  You know is distinguishing and and potentially changes the way you're gonna use this sort of thing, right?
[52:25.740 --> 52:29.700]  I think that yeah, I think you're right though that in the video like I think Johnny I've you know
[52:30.300 --> 52:31.860]  We're not like putting words in his mouth
[52:31.860 --> 52:36.260]  That's exactly what he said like that each one of those leaps forward came with one
[52:36.260 --> 52:42.580]  New thing like the Macintosh with the mouse pointer, right? Right. You have a thing on your desk that you slide around your desk
[52:42.580 --> 52:44.580]  And it moves a pointer on your screen
[52:44.860 --> 52:47.060]  That's what the crown is to the Apple watch
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.140]  Yeah
[52:48.140 --> 52:50.900]  So so when you did the when you got to try one on
[52:51.180 --> 52:55.700]  Did what did you try one of the functional ones on or did you just have the I know they had like a demo?
[52:56.100 --> 52:56.620]  No
[52:56.620 --> 53:02.100]  Nobody that I know of got to try on only Apple employees got had the functioning ones the ones that I got to try on
[53:02.100 --> 53:07.260]  We're all running the loop, but the loop included like when?
[53:08.700 --> 53:12.180]  It included things like getting a text message. So it's like
[53:13.020 --> 53:17.180]  You know, it wasn't like a movie was playing on a watch. It's like a series of
[53:18.660 --> 53:24.620]  Events. Yeah, you know, right, but it's still not but so did you use the digital crown at all? I
[53:25.620 --> 53:28.380]  Got to spin it, but I did not get to
[53:28.380 --> 53:34.380]  Use it in a meaningful way like it like when I spun it. It didn't affect what was going on on the watch, right?
[53:34.380 --> 53:39.900]  Yeah, so that's that's sort of what I was trying to get at is that I guess almost nobody besides Apple people has any experience
[53:39.900 --> 53:45.780]  With how this interface actually works, right? Oh, and that reminds me I have a bit of
[53:47.700 --> 53:55.620]  Follow-up from last week with I had John Moltz on the show and I used the wrong word I described it. I
[53:55.620 --> 54:01.620]  Described the feel of the digital crown as I used the word lugubrious
[54:04.260 --> 54:08.220]  I knew it was a really wonderful word that started with L
[54:08.220 --> 54:12.460]  But lugubrious is a word that means looking or sounding sad and dismal
[54:14.580 --> 54:19.860]  It sounds like it means like liquid yeah, which is somehow why
[54:19.860 --> 54:26.020]  somehow why I extemporaneously speaking it came to mind the word I was looking for was
[54:26.780 --> 54:28.780]  lugubriousness
[54:29.540 --> 54:32.140]  As in lubricated yes, okay
[54:32.940 --> 54:35.300]  Lugubrious is a word that means well
[54:35.300 --> 54:42.280]  The first sense of it is not what I mean the first sense means offensively displaying or intended to arouse sexual desire
[54:43.420 --> 54:45.500]  That is not what I meant. I meant
[54:46.140 --> 54:47.380]  definition to
[54:47.380 --> 54:50.620]  smooth and slippery with oil or a similar substance
[54:51.180 --> 54:57.180]  okay, and there is it's simply the only word that I've encountered that describes the feel of
[54:57.740 --> 54:59.740]  The digital crown it has a wonderful
[55:00.940 --> 55:03.660]  Wonderful almost magical lugubriousness to it
[55:04.740 --> 55:09.000]  Alright, I'm telling you when this thing comes out and everybody gets to play with it
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.900]  I'm telling it this is all everybody is gonna say is oh my god
[55:11.900 --> 55:17.620]  I like to just sit there and spin that wheel. It just has this wonderful feel it feels amazing. It
[55:18.420 --> 55:25.620]  Does not feel like you're spinning a mechanical thing. It feels like like it's somehow suspended in the world's like
[55:26.420 --> 55:32.060]  Best oil and that it's like not even touching anything mechanical and it just spins in the oil
[55:32.820 --> 55:36.580]  And it doesn't it doesn't spin. It doesn't ever reach an endpoint, right?
[55:36.580 --> 55:43.580]  No, it spins infinitely in both directions like a like a mouse pointer or a you know mouse wheel like a scroll wheel
[55:43.580 --> 55:46.540]  Yeah, yeah, right, right. So if you were if if
[55:48.860 --> 55:52.680]  It's still and I you know people say to me like I say like even on the show last week
[55:52.680 --> 55:56.360]  I I'll emphasize I really I still have so many questions about Apple
[55:56.360 --> 55:59.520]  I mean, I'm kind of bummed that I'm not going to the event because I have so many questions, but
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.140]  You know and there's so many other events where I go and I don't really have that many questions
[56:05.140 --> 56:07.200]  You know, I mean like right when there's a new iPhone
[56:07.200 --> 56:13.480]  it's not gonna be terribly different from the old iPhone right like that or the better example would be the
[56:13.900 --> 56:17.400]  iPads last year. All right, because at least with the iPhones last year
[56:17.400 --> 56:21.060]  It's like well, am I gonna like a bigger phone how you know, the big phone was kind of a curiosity
[56:21.620 --> 56:26.940]  But with the iPads it was like same as last year, but now they have touch ID. It's like, okay
[56:26.940 --> 56:31.540]  I'm not saying I don't blame Apple. I'm not saying that was a bad event. I'm saying that's somehow that's how progress happens
[56:31.540 --> 56:33.660]  I'm just saying if I had to miss that event
[56:33.660 --> 56:37.940]  I I don't really feel like I was missing out on a chance to really learn anything
[56:37.940 --> 56:41.060]  I mean, it's pretty easy to figure out, you know remotely
[56:41.820 --> 56:47.080]  Where's the watch? I have so many questions so many questions and and I don't I don't see how anybody couldn't
[56:47.220 --> 56:52.060]  You know beefs chock full of questions because though the one thing they've shown that you use the crown for is zooming
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.080]  So when you're on the home screen
[56:54.080 --> 56:59.120]  You can turn it one with spin it one way and the apps get smaller and you'll see more of them and you spin it
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.580]  The other way and you zoom in which makes them easier to tap
[57:01.580 --> 57:08.900]  And then the photos work the same way so you can zoom out and you see, you know thousands of two or hundreds
[57:08.900 --> 57:12.340]  I guess of tiny little thumbnails and then you can zoom in and make them bigger
[57:12.540 --> 57:18.540]  But are you gonna be able to use it to scroll or when you scroll is that you know, like you use the touch screen. I
[57:19.780 --> 57:23.580]  Mean, I can't imagine that you're gonna want to read long passages of text
[57:23.740 --> 57:25.340]  but you know
[57:25.340 --> 57:30.780]  It still seems to me like that would work for scrolling too because that it would for the same reason that they said that they
[57:30.780 --> 57:35.440]  Didn't want to use touch for everything which is that your you know, your big fat finger covers everything skits in the way
[57:35.440 --> 57:37.440]  Yeah, right. I
[57:38.780 --> 57:42.300]  Should take another break for a sponsor, but I just off the top of my head another thing
[57:42.300 --> 57:45.980]  I know I've mentioned this before but it's okay because everybody forgets all sorts of stuff
[57:45.980 --> 57:48.820]  But I keep getting questions on Twitter about whether there are going to be left-handed
[57:50.060 --> 57:57.780]  Models of the watch and the answer is no you can just it's a setting it might even be right
[57:57.780 --> 58:02.020]  Yeah, you just turn it upside down and because the straps come right off. It's very easy
[58:02.020 --> 58:04.140]  you'll just take the straps off put the
[58:04.620 --> 58:09.940]  You know top strap on the bottom bottom strap on the top and then when you put it on your wrist it like knows
[58:09.940 --> 58:13.380]  That oh you're left-handed and it'll just turn the whole interface upside down
[58:13.380 --> 58:18.380]  And it is is it not even a setting that you need to adjust? I don't think so
[58:18.380 --> 58:24.700]  Although I don't know because I asked it might be the sort of thing that if if you do it
[58:24.700 --> 58:28.960]  Before you go through the first run. It'll recognize it and no, okay
[58:30.020 --> 58:36.520]  But otherwise, you know, I think it's just a quick setting, you know open up settings and you know tap a checkbox and
[58:37.300 --> 58:38.820]  It just turns upside down
[58:38.820 --> 58:44.860]  so the only difference you'll have as a left-handed user is that your crown will be underneath the button and
[58:45.380 --> 58:48.720]  So yeah that of the crown being above the button. It'll be below the button
[58:48.720 --> 58:51.620]  That's the only difference which does make it a little weird
[58:51.620 --> 58:56.100]  It still makes me you know, I'm still curious about the whole idea that it's not
[58:56.660 --> 58:59.920]  Centered that the crown isn't centered because if the crown were centered
[59:00.140 --> 59:05.380]  Which it is on a lot of watches then it would be it would be identical left-handed and right-handed. I
[59:06.220 --> 59:12.880]  Don't think it's a big difference though. And I also know I saw firsthand walking around after the event. I saw at EQ
[59:13.980 --> 59:16.780]  Wearing his and he's left-handed and he had it on his right hand
[59:17.940 --> 59:19.180]  upside down
[59:19.180 --> 59:23.300]  Well, wait, but there's only one button right? There's the crown on the button, right?
[59:23.300 --> 59:27.820]  But the button is underneath the crew when you're wearing it on your left wrist
[59:27.820 --> 59:32.080]  The crown is at the top and you have buttons underneath. So if you turn it upside down
[59:32.820 --> 59:36.660]  The crown is on the bottom and the button is at the top, right?
[59:36.660 --> 59:41.380]  But even if even if the crown were centered the button would still oh, yeah the button would still yeah, that's flipped
[59:41.380 --> 59:43.380]  Yeah, exactly. I'm in my
[59:43.380 --> 59:49.220]  You know, I wonder why they didn't do it this way world it would I guess it's sort of why didn't they put the button?
[59:49.220 --> 59:51.220]  On one side and the crown on the other
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.940]  Right having both in the center
[59:52.940 --> 59:58.660]  But if you're gonna put one above the other it would definitely not be the same left-handed and right-handed, right? Yeah
[59:59.980 --> 01:00:04.420]  Let me take a break here and thank our good friends at Casper
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.500]  Casper P E R
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:15.300]  Casper this is the mattress people. Right? These are the mattress people online retailer of premium mattresses
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:21.460]  For a fraction of the price the mattress industry has inherently forced consumers into paying
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.380]  Notoriously high markups and they confuse the hell out of you
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:30.420]  You know you go into one mattress store and it's like the the Sealy posturpedic
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.900]  XPC to seven you go to the next door. They don't have that one
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.940]  They because they did from one store to another they sell the same mattress with a completely different name
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:46.700]  So that you can't do the sort of comparison shopping that any sane person would do when when you know buying something
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.700]  You know significant like a mattress
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.540]  It's a scam. It's a cartel. Well Casper is busting it up
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:00.020]  Revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms and all that crap
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.060]  They just pass the savings directly to you the consumer. Is it any good?
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.740]  Yes, a Casper mattress provides resilience and long-lasting
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.260]  Supportive comfort Casper's mattress is one of a kind
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:18.460]  It's a new hybrid mattress that combines premium latex foam with memory foam
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.300]  Now I've had one here. I've also been on one of those memory foam mattresses. I don't like it
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.500]  I feel like you get you get sunk in there like you're an egg carton or something like that
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.780]  I don't want to get up from bed and have like a
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.820]  Crime scene outline on my body on the bed. This isn't like that at all
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:37.260]  It's like just enough of the memory ish stuff that I'm surprised that there's any of it
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.580]  But they use a little bit of it, you know, that's what they call it
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.560]  But it's not you know, there's no like outline of your body in there
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.100]  We go to a retail store mattresses often cost well over
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.100]  1,500 bucks
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:55.060]  That's a that's a fact I've it's unbelievable how much mattresses like that's like one of those little things about getting in the real world
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.580]  Where you have to buy your own beds and like you said and it's too grand out of your pocket
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.300]  Oh, yeah
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:06.780]  It's too grand to get a crane to put your refrigerator in your house and you're like you serious $2,000. Jesus
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:12.180]  Well Casper mattresses cost between 500 bucks for a twin size mattress
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.140]  600 for a twin XL. I didn't know twin XL was a size
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.500]  750 for full
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500]  850 for Queen and only
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:28.180]  950 bucks for a king-size mattress 950 bucks for a top quality mattress
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:34.740]  Now they totally understand the whole idea of buying it's the same thing with Warby Parker. How are you gonna buy glasses?
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.460]  Without trying them on. Well, how are you gonna buy a mattress without trying it out? Here's the thing. It's completely risk-free
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:48.860]  They offer free delivery and free returns within a hundred day period so buy it
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:54.620]  It shows up at your house. It is amazing. It shows as you think. Well, how the hell do they ship a mattress?
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.220]  Well, they because it they use the foam because it's like this foam type thing
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:03.220]  They vacuum seal the thing up and it shows up in a box. It's like the size of like a sandwich, right?
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.980]  No, it's like a little
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.620]  It's dry like two sandwiches. That's it. It's a little bit bigger than this sandwich, but it's
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.080]  Surprisingly small. It's probably about the same size as the box that your little dorm room
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.340]  temporary fridge came in
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.860]  right
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.580]  amazingly small for
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.180]  The queen size mattress that I had him send can't believe it
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.100]  but it's like when they tell you to
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:30.580]  If you want to take some advice me when they tell you to put it in a room where you want it before you open
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.580]  It do do that
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:39.460]  Do that does it explode out of the box or does it just not explode but it is very rapid it
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.620]  The mattress wants to be big
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.700]  The mattress wants to expand to the size of a mattress
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:49.380]  But you have a hundred days. No questions
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.540]  They you don't like have to call them up and and talk to like a hard sell
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.460]  Comcast guy who's gonna be like trying to talk you into keeping a mattress
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.580]  You don't like it if you you just you just send it right back and you know
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.380]  I guess getting it out of your house is gonna be a little bit harder and getting it in because it's already expanded but they
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.380]  Take care of it. No questions asked no hassle
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:14.500]  There's no guy who's gonna give you a hard time about sending it back. They'll take it back because they're so
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.100]  confident
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.220]  That you're gonna like it
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.340]  And in fact, I think I don't know I might be wrong here
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.100]  But I think that they've had such success that they actually like expand. I think that hundred day period is actually
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.140]  Longer than it used to be because there were so few people who sent it back
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:38.300]  Where do you go to find out more go to Casper CASP ER Casper sleep calm

[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.820]  I maybe what happened is that after I bitched about it the last time that they didn't have the though then they added to the
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.820]  But then they got rid of the got rid of them
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.360]  Well, anyway, thank God Paul, you know

[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.880]  Good for them for putting it on there. I paid good money for that
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.780]  So anyway, we talked about pebble we're talking about Apple watch
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.780]  We
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:13.220]  Could get into pricing I know I've written about this I don't I mean you've written about it and that was interesting enough
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.180]  I find it sort of
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.220]  We're gonna know in a week, right? Right. I do
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.140]  I know I
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.740]  That's the thing about doing this show the show before an event is fun because it's like the one time where you can you can
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.700]  Be completely wrong and just make stuff up and it's like anything could happen
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.140]  But then it's like, you know six days from now
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:35.380]  Everything we said is either gonna be completely wrong and we look like idiots or even if we were right
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.380]  It doesn't matter because okay. Yeah, I
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.860]  mean the the most interesting thing to me is
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.820]  seeing just how big the range is and you know
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.100]  They said they've only told us one thing that it's 349 for the very cheapest watch, right?
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:54.980]  And that to me means I figure there's like a slight chance. It's actually 299. What do you think?
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:07:00.140]  No, you don't think you don't think they come down from that? Nope. Haven't they done that before? I?
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.740]  Think I feel like there was a product where they had pre announced a price and then they dropped at 50 bucks. I
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.860]  Mean it certainly is more possible than that. They they raised the price, you know, right?
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:20.340]  It's certainly not gonna be more than 349 to start right? There's gonna be at least one model you can get for 349 for sure. I
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.560]  I guess 299 is possible, but I don't know that just feels it feels to me
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.620]  like a side effect of the Tim Cook era of Apple is that
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.360]  they've they've really neatened up on things like that, you know, like
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.900]  Like famously with the iPhone
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.180]  When they announced it at Macworld in January 2007, it had some kind of high
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.760]  polymer plastic
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:55.000]  touchscreen, right and then it was like right in May like where they like first and then like now it's like final shipping dates and
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Stuff and they said and by the way
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:05.120]  We've upgraded the display from plastic to this amazing glass from from you know, what's that company Corning Corning?
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.600]  and you know and then in stories that have come out in the years since it was this is clearly like
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:18.200]  You know, you know that it was Steve who's like god damn it, you know, this is nicer so we're definitely doing it
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.000]  We're not waiting a year
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.860]  We're getting it in here now and that it's like up to Tim Cook to like somehow make this happen
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.360]  Where like and I think the story was like they had to find a factory
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.080]  They had to like ramp the factory up to do it. It wasn't as if this existed and was being made, right?
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.880]  It was like nobody was crazy, right?
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.920]  It was like nobody was really using it like Corning and invented Gorilla Glass years before but nobody had really found a use for it
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.500]  And they just didn't you know, it was you know
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.700]  They more or less needed them to like make more of it than they'd ever made before
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.000]  Right, and by the way, it's got to happen in like the next four weeks
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:54.880]  So and so you're saying that I don't think like that tighter. Yeah stuff like that doesn't happen anymore
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.680]  I don't think I don't you know
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:02.120]  I think part of it is that Jobs was clearly impetuous and I don't think anybody would describe Tim Cook is
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.960]  Impetuous and you know, I just think that you know, it's just a little bit more orderly
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:13.480]  Okay, I feel like I feel like as of September Tim Cook knew that they could sell this entry thing for 349 and you know
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.560]  Marketing wise whatever, you know, however, they decided that that looks good as the entry-level price. I just don't see how that would change
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.120]  Okay, so we're starting at 349
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:27.560]  Yeah, so to me the only I don't care if it's you know exactly 999 or 1299 whatever
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.160]  but I think the the interesting thing to me is just the three price points of
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:37.520]  You know the entry-level and then just the straight-up Apple watch and the addition which I think is I hate that
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.280]  that
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.480]  suffix as a to try and mean a whole nother thing, but the more I write about it the harder the
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:53.960]  Is it's never ceases being a mouthful to Apple watch edition, right? Because you I keep wanting to use additions
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.600]  To mean what they call
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:03.520]  Collections, right? Yeah, that's that's just the word addition means or often means, you know a group of something, right?
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.640]  And so I find it very awkward for that to be a model
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.880]  But whatever and combined with the fact and I've still to this date
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.720]  It's still not gotten used to the fact that the mid price or mid level of the steel one is just called Apple watch
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:24.200]  I really wish that it was the app, you know, the basic Apple watch sport Apple watch steel Apple watch edition
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.400]  I don't call it something, you know, oh give it give that one give that one some sort of suffixes
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.320]  Well, they all have a name right, right. There'd be like sport steel and addition
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.040]  You know, I kind of see why they didn't I'm not even sick because I can't think of a good name
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.160]  I don't think steel is a great name. I think you know, it's
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.800]  You know, I don't know it's not great sounds heavy yeah, and it's maybe sounds a little masculine
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.000]  Right. Oh, yeah, you know
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.200]  So I know you know, I don't know and regular regular sounds stupid, too
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:56.780]  You know
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:03.000]  It's just called Apple watch but it's still it makes it very hard to write about because sometimes when you say Apple watch you mean
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.160]  All of them, you know, like your app right your app just runs on Apple watch and it doesn't matter which one you bought
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.000]  But when you're shopping if you just buy an Apple watch you're buying a very specific model, you know, you're buying the stainless steel one
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.920]  Very confusing perhaps worrisome. I don't know. Maybe it's a little worrisome that it's that that they've you know
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.760]  They're coming out with something that seems so can sometime is so hard to talk about
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.720]  Well, it's interesting because you would before we did before we started the show
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.900]  You sent me this image that somebody made and it was based on pricing predictions you had made. Yeah, they made this whole
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.440]  Image and it was just you know, here's all the prices and I guess you said they've got circulated as if this was a real leak
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.900]  Right. I'm I'll put it. I will absolutely positively Dave make sure I put this in the show notes
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.680]  I've already got a link in my
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.180]  Show notes as we go. It's a guy
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.640]  Why can't anybody on a forum give themselves a real name?
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.420]  Peach your one is a Mac rumors forum member and last week. He posted this image
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.640]  And he is what he wrote. He's very honest. He's straightforward about he wrote. I made this speculative
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.660]  qualitative price list based in large part on Gruber's speculation colon and then here's the image that he made
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.280]  But he he's using Apple
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.080]  Photography of the watches and he's set the names in the you know
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.120]  San Francisco font and he's got the prices in Helvetica
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:36.680]  So it's vaguely styled or roughly styled in the format of Apple's marketing materials
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.040]  I could tell by looking at it right away that it's not official
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.260]  it's there's little subtle things that are off about the the fonts, but it's close enough that
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.520]  95% of people could easily be convinced that this is from Apple
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.440]  Right, and so then it got circulated as if this had leaked out of Apple, right?
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.320]  Because it's all one big image and of course it hit Twitter and people stop, you know immediately
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.740]  Especially when the source is something like a forum post at Mac rumors and it like spun out of control
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.040]  like
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.240]  Incredibly fast like within 24 hours over the last weekend
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.080]  It went from did you see that there was a guy who posted a thing in the Mac rumors forum to?
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:24.360]  Like the poor kid some poor kid at I download blog like by the next day had written. These are the Apple watch prices
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.480]  And then had to retract it. Yeah, I had to retract it with a
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.040]  Horribly can he's very contrite about it. But you know
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.000]  Well, this is what was interesting about the whole thing. I still get it. If you look at my Twitter stream, by the way
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.240]  Right now as we speak
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.640]  There's you won't have to go more than 20 or 30 before you'll find somebody asking me what I think about this leaked
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.160]  priceless
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.400]  Which is based on your own predictions
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.600]  Right from like two weeks earlier, right, but it's actually not I actually think that these prices are off
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.400]  There's some things that I think he probably got right and he was very thoughtful about but I think once he gets past
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  Apple watch sport he's vastly
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.720]  underestimating the price of these things
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.560]  Well, what I thought was interesting about it was just how clunky the image was and it shows
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.120]  Yeah, I have to pull the thing up, but it shows there's like 18 rows aren't there?
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.880]  At least right right and it's it's showing, you know, here's the intro sport. Here's the steel sport
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:30.280]  Here's the main Apple watch. Here's the Apple watch in space gray or whatever and he's got 12 pricing tiers
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.400]  Okay, and each one in two sizes 38 and 42
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.240]  And we mentioned this earlier in the show
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.460]  I think that actually makes sense that I don't know about at the sport level. I could see like maybe it's sport
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.280]  They're both just 349 and you just pick the size you want
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.980]  But then I think once you go to steel and gold there there probably will be a small difference in price
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.280]  right
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.000]  But it was interesting just because of how clunky it actually is and you know
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.120]  We were talking about how clunky it is to talk about the different
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.120]  collections
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.480]  and I think it's I don't know it'll be interesting to see just how this plays out because
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.320]  Apple has not really ever had anything at least not recently that was this complex or this complicated, right?
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.240]  It is like buying a watch
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.680]  I mean like when you go and buy, you know a watch at a jewelry store, you know
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.360]  you can't just say I want a you know Rolex Explorer and
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.200]  Well, I guess Rolex Explorer is actually one where there is just one
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.200]  Maybe that's a bad example
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.280]  Right, you know like a Rolex Submariner has all sorts of color choices just on the dial. There's a blue dial
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:42.560]  There's green dial. The black dial is the traditional one steel steel with gold all gold, you know, etc, etc
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.440]  And that there's you know, all sorts of matrixes like that within
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.840]  The line of all the major watch brands where you know certain watches come in all sorts of different
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.880]  You know dial colors and band colors and stuff like that
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.660]  But it's absolutely nothing like any Apple product before right and and you know
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.280]  Apple used to have these terrible major matrices of products
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.720]  you know the ten different models of performa back in the early 90s and so on right and
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.360]  Then I think it's in my mind
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:17.240]  It's sort of burned in where Steve Jobs would have a grid and there would just be four items
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.640]  Right, right and it's you know, good better best and and I don't know I guess that's only three items, but
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.640]  well famously the
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.600]  To me it was like a moment where I remember thinking like I think that this guy is gonna do it
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.320]  I think he's gonna turn the company around. Is that that four-way matrix for?
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.400]  It was laptop desktops. Yeah pro consumer and
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.080]  So it's the iBook. It's the power book. It's the iMac. It's the power Mac, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.960]  That's really the one I'm thinking. Yeah, and it was brilliant and it in hindsight
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.000]  I think it's so easy to underestimate the brilliance of that decision
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.600]  But it it cut all sorts, you know
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.160]  Cutting products out of a company is always painful politically unless you're somebody like jobs who just doesn't give a shit about the policy
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.960]  Screw you if your job was running the performance 700 line, you know, you know get with the program
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.840]  And none of the no other computer company had a had a lineup like that, right?
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.040]  I mean even to this day if you go to like Dell calm and try to configure
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:24.080]  It's a nightmare trying to it's hard to even figure out like even if you just know I want like the the maxed out
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.160]  You know, I want the best laptop I can get it's like hard to figure it out
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.680]  All right, it's this is nothing like that
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.360]  And again, that's not to say that if Steve Jobs were still around they wouldn't be doing this
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.080]  Who knows, you know, maybe you know, he and Johnny I've mapped out these watches, you know five years ago
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.160]  And you know, he'd be right on board watches are different. You know, there's no you know
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.560]  I do you can't sell watches like you sell
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  PCs and laptops well
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.120]  Well, are you well?
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:57.280]  They're not they're not willing to try at least right now or they're looking to try doing it the way you normally sell a watch
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.760]  As opposed to the way that they sell phones and computers. Yeah. No, I guess you're right
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.960]  I shouldn't say you can't I should say it doesn't Apple apparently doesn't think that they can or I should
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.360]  well, and so the interesting thing to me is I was in an Apple store what about a week ago and
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  I
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.040]  They haven't shown how the stores are gonna change, but they're clearly gonna have to change
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.960]  And I think that's something that everyone will see in the near future and and that to me is is more interesting than speculating on
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.120]  The price is you know, you've been in a store recently, right? Yeah a couple times. Yeah. What are they gonna do?
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.640]  I don't know
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.640]  I mean and they even said in the New Yorker story on Johnny I've that big one profile
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:41.200]  They even mentioned that one of the things he's got going on is that he's leading a redesign of the story
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.920]  it sounds to me like from it was sort of an offhand remark in
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.840]  You know, the article was so long that it's easy to just throw something off
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.080]  But it it seems like a huge undertaking that they're gonna redesign all of the stores, you know
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.840]  He's working hand in hand with Angela aren'ts on that, right?
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.600]  Partly for the watch for sure
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.700]  I'm I'm guessing partly just to build for the future because who knows what they're gonna do next, you know
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.300]  But I have no idea what they're gonna do. I'm my best guess at this point
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:16.580]  Is that there's nowhere near enough time for them to renovate even if it's not a total redesign of every store
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:22.020]  Even if it's some kind of we're gonna renovate the where the Genius bar used to be or something, you know
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.020]  we're gonna get rid of all the
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.500]  you know take this take the spot in the stores where they used to sell gift cards and if I guess if you want a
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.780]  Gift card now you just talk to somebody and we'll use that space to sell the watches
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.500]  I
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.540]  Don't think the I don't think the vast majority of stores are gonna have the addition models
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.140]  I think that at least it started out my best
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.940]  This is my bet because I just don't think there's enough time like it's already March 2nd
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:53.820]  If they don't ship until April 30, which would be the lot and I don't think that's good given that the event is on March 9th
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.920]  I'm kind of thinking they're gonna ship in early April, right?
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:02.220]  But you know the the longest period of time they have between like seven weeks, right?
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.860]  And there's no way that they could do that across. However many hundred stores they have
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.900]  So do you think I think it's like three or four hundred stores now? Yeah, so do you think?
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:13.340]  the addition models will be something that you go to New York City or LA or
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:21.220]  You know could be to start and certainly San Francisco, right? Right, you know, there's whatever wherever the major cities
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:25.420]  Yeah, well and maybe that's all the stores that are like landmarks
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.660]  Okay, you know there's I don't know what I don't quite think that they have like a tier of those stores
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.660]  You know like a name for it, but they're you know
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.700]  The ones like in London that Tim Cook was just at this week, you know
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:43.680]  The ones that look architecturally interesting in it and that are physically bigger that they'll have, you know a separate little
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:48.900]  Salon, you know where you'll buy the addition models
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:53.980]  I think I you know, and I think they could they could even start and just say it's only in three cities to start
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.620]  New York, you know Los Angeles and San Francisco and
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.740]  Then they'll slowly roll that out over time
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:04.700]  Right. Yeah, I don't know. It's the to me
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.580]  That's that's a very interesting aspect of it that you know
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.540]  Not a lot of people will consider and then maybe it doesn't really matter that much
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:15.260]  But this is it's not it's not changing the company the way that the iPad changed the company
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:20.520]  Because that was or it's changing it much more than the iPad or even the iPhone changed the company because those are still
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:27.900]  Computing devices that are sold the way computing devices are sold and the watch clearly is not going to be sold that way, right?
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:32.300]  And it's there's so many different ways where it's like you can't have it both ways
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.540]  like if you're going to say we're going and I just I really do believe that this is true that these are
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:44.000]  $10,000 watches maybe you know if and again if I'm right that they're that they sell a gold link band
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.740]  $20,000 watches
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:54.480]  And that's totally reasonable given the price of fine watches and solid gold bracelets in the market today
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480]  But
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.460]  You can't have those things being sold by kids wearing jeans and t-shirts
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.400]  Right who like their next the next thing that they're doing is
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.400]  Scanning somebody's Hello Kitty iPhone case
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.400]  Yeah, what can I help you with I'm buying a Hello Kitty iPhone case, oh, okay, thank you here you go
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:24.400]  Do you want a receipt? Nope? All right, I'm buying a $15,000 watch. Okay, here you go
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.400]  Like well, I won't said last week. Do you think they're gonna let you do the walk out and pay on your
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.900]  Walk out the door you even imagine how hard you'd get tackle
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.680]  I don't walk out of the store with a self-paid
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.040]  $15,000
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.380]  Like they're just gonna have them on the shelf just in a little little case
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:49.940]  I just grab it and you flash your receipt and you're good to go. No, I I don't know
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.140]  I'm having so much fun with this watch thing
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.020]  and again
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:58.140]  It's not even because I know I want one and I can't wait to get it because I don't even know I'm so
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.980]  So many questions about what I would find useful with it
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:06.380]  I just find it useful like as somebody who's professionally paid to write about the company that there's so many things
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:10.620]  We don't know and it did and there don't seem to be good answers for it
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:16.220]  There just does not seem to be a good answer for how do you sell a $10,000 gold watch in the Apple store?
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.220]  I don't know
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:24.860]  Like I said the moles last week I know in the Philly store we have an upstairs that's not retail you can't wander up there
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:27.580]  It's like the business center and they have classes and stuff like that
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:34.820]  And I could see them apportioning, you know, like like if you go in to buy the edition you would be taken up there
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.580]  But even then even if if like you get escorted to a quiet
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:44.460]  Salon type experience and get you know a concierge level of sales. It's a cucumber water
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.700]  Yeah, cucumber water and you know, maybe a glass of bubbly
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.460]  And you get to try these watches on while sitting, you know, or whatever
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.660]  I still don't see how you go from the front of the store to where you tell somebody
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.020]  You know, that's what you're here for right like at some, you know
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:07.060]  Like that's like it my big irritation with Apple stores in general is that it sometimes it's so hard to get somebody's attention
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.540]  Like if you know exactly what you want to get right
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:17.300]  You know, like we got Jonas a Macbook for Christmas
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.940]  And I knew I knew exactly what I wanted to get and it's like, you know
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:25.540]  What didn't take too long and you know, I have to say I don't given it
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.300]  It was the holiday season and everything
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.300]  It didn't take too long
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.820]  But it seemed to take a little bit too long given that I knew exactly what I wanted when I stepped foot into the store
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.420]  Right. Yeah. Yeah, and and now they're adding a whole
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:43.340]  Separate section most likely right like if you walk into a Tiffany to buy some fine jewelry
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:46.380]  You know, there's no there aren't any there's no loud crowds
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:53.180]  You know, you don't kids sitting on round balls playing bugs life or I write it and it's
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.100]  You know and who knows, you know, I you know, maybe if it's like the Christmas or whatever
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:02.900]  Maybe you might have to wait to before a sales person will will come greet you
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:09.700]  But once the first salesperson who greets you is going to be able to handle your request whether it's for a hundred and fifty dollar
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:14.100]  Pendant or whether it's for a fifteen thousand dollar pendant, right?
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:18.980]  It's like whatever it is that you're there to buy a Tiffany that your sales rep is going to make you feel
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.900]  You know comfortable and you know, like you're in the right place, right?
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.020]  I just don't get it with that
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.020]  I
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.860]  Think the more I think I wrote about this last week I the more I look at the bands the more I think that there's gonna
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.020]  be
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.140]  wide variation and pricing based on the band
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:42.040]  I'm convinced of it and I think it's sort of how they fill in the gaps
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.800]  Like if you're looking I think if you're looking and I this is how I from months
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.420]  I just thinking well three main price points, you know 349 for sport
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:56.700]  Something maybe a thousand for the steel and five thousand for gold or whatever. I think that within each collection
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.500]  I'm making sure I use the right word within each collection. There's gonna be I think a
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:08.500]  Not startlingly big but a very wide variety like I could see the still based on fans
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:12.840]  Yeah, I could see the steel one like starting at like seven hundred dollars
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.140]  With the rubber band. What do they call it? Poly you?
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.380]  You're a theme. What's the famous their fancy word for rubber band rubber?
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.300]  Floral elastomer
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.460]  Black floral
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.740]  elastomer
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:37.340]  So I could see that starting at let's say 700 which would be double the price of the sport watch which to me is like
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.500]  A reasonable like increment to go from aluminum to steel you double it
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500]  But
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.260]  Then I would think like the ones with the leather bands would be a couple hundred bucks more than that and I could see like
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.860]  The the metal link band one being like fifteen hundred dollars or even two thousand dollars
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:59.980]  And I know everybody else is like nobody else is thinking that for the steel one, but I I could see them doing it. I
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:06.220]  Read I just reread it before we started the show on an Apple watches page. You go to apple.com
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:11.540]  Apple.com slash watch slash Apple dash watch now, this is probably going to change
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.500]  Next week. So you you know, go check it out before, you know, I'm guessing the website will be redone
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:24.220]  After it's released, but if here's their description for the link bracelet, this is for the steel watch. This isn't for the addition
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.420]  this is for
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.420]  Steel watch crafted from the same
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:33.300]  316 L stainless steel alloy is the case the link bracelet has more than 100 components
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:40.340]  The machining process is so precise. It takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band in
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:47.140]  Part that's because they aren't simply a uniform size but subtly increase in width as they approach the case
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.780]  Once assembled the links are brushed by hand
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:58.980]  to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design the custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet and
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:06.420]  several links feature a simple release button so you can add and remove links without any special tools available in stainless steel and black
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.780]  stainless steel
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.780]  If it takes nine hours for them
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:17.340]  One and then after it's assembled it's polished by hand that that's not going to be like a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:21.860]  Extra like I I see I'm not exaggerating like that
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:24.780]  That might be like a fifteen hundred dollar bracelet
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:30.300]  Like it might mean that the you know, the watch that comes with that bracelet is is two thousand dollars. I
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:38.620]  Mean reading that description. It certainly sounds more much more expensive than I think what people are anticipating. Yeah, right
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.940]  It's like at first like the way they showed it at the event in September
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.500]  It's like you can get a bracelet that matches your taste
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:51.980]  Maybe you're you know, maybe and I like I've had over the years. I've had many watches with like a rubber plastic strap
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.380]  I find them to be very comfortable. I think you know, I always feel like you can get them nice and tight
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:29:01.780]  And then they have a little bit of give I I think that the floral elastomer band is gonna be great
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:07.380]  But they made it seem as though it's like pick the one that matches your style and you know
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.380]  Maybe you know, I think everybody thought well, maybe this the link bracelet will cost a little bit more
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.940]  But I if you think about it
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:18.500]  If you just start with the assumption that it's gonna cost a lot more that description makes a lot more sense
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.640]  Nine hours to cut the links is for one
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:28.300]  I'll tell you what, they're saying, you know, that's because they chained with slightly
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.980]  Maybe they could have just made them the same width. Well, or maybe you could have cut in about four hours
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:38.140]  Well, why couldn't you have one machine that cuts the first link one machine, you know, right, right, right?
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:45.860]  It actually it seems kind of crazy that it takes nine hours, you know, but I mean I have no reason to doubt them
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:51.980]  But they're certainly seem to be setting it up it that to me sounds like the description of a fifteen hundred dollar bracelet of an expensive
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.140]  piece of
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.140]  Watch band. Yeah, right
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:00.820]  And I think that's the thing that's so interesting to me is that all of these watches are the same
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:07.100]  Like the gold whatever it costs whether it's only fifteen hundred bucks or whether it's fifteen thousand bucks
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:12.300]  It's still the exact same device as the watch that you're gonna get for three hundred forty nine bucks
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.300]  And that's nuts
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:18.380]  well, but there is precedent for that in the the
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:22.620]  Some precedent not scaling all the way down to 349
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:28.700]  But that's you know, like if you buy a Rolex Submariner in stainless steel in the fashion world
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:35.420]  There's huge precedent right right or yeah or like handbags right that there, you know, there might be two Louis Vuitton bags
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.420]  but one is made out of
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.900]  You know, I don't know some kind of
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:44.460]  Special rare leather and the other one is made out of the regular leather and it's you know
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:49.180]  $5,000 difference and it's the exact same bag same dimension same pocket same zippers
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:55.580]  Everything's the same except one is made out of a different kind of leather and it costs $5,000 more, you know
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.140]  but in terms of technology
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:05.980]  What has besides besides the outlier like what's the virtue is the one that makes a case for your phone that makes it worth like?
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:10.780]  A case for your phone that makes it worth like no not a case. It is a phone. It's it's a whole phone, right?
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.220]  Right, but it's oh well, but the value in it is all in the case, right?
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:19.900]  The case of the phone the the casing molson and I were talking about this last week. They also offer a
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:27.580]  Concierge service where there's like a special button on the phone and then it you just hit this button and then you get like a virtue
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:32.220]  Person who will be like we want on star for your phone. Yeah. Yeah, and you're like, oh, I want to you know
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.220]  I want to go to an Italian restaurant tonight
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:38.780]  Well, but I mean besides these outliers in terms of selling technology
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.380]  I don't think there's ever been anything like this. No
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:47.180]  No, you cannot think of it as a technology product. You really kid doesn't make any sense, right?
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:51.660]  Well, but I think I think that's completely true. But I think the
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.420]  $349 one as a technology product is very interesting. Yeah
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:02.300]  So it's it's almost like they're selling, you know an Apple watch for 349 bucks or Apple watch sport, whatever
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:08.620]  and then they're also entering the fashion world with this, you know, all these bands and all these different cases and
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:11.260]  And it's it's two completely different
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.940]  Markets. Yeah, absolutely
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:17.500]  it's it also I
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:24.060]  Remember the day of the event the very day of the event back in September. I met Michael Lop
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:30.060]  in San Francisco, you know like after he got out of work at five and
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.620]  We got a drink and like the first thing he said and I thought was so astute
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:37.100]  Is that it it seems as though they're launching this product?
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.940]  three years in
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.940]  You know that the Apple way to do it would have been the first one. Here's the here's Apple watch
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:48.540]  It's one size one color one style as a white band. Here's what it does
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:54.940]  And then the next year they fix it and make it better whatever and then maybe in the third year they say, okay
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.860]  This has been great. It's been a great success
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:01.860]  Now you can get it in steel. You can get it in gold etc. You know, here's all these other leather bands
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:08.620]  Right, this is fully formed in terms of they didn't just make the watch and they didn't just make the watch in three different cases
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:14.660]  They made all these bands and they've they've done every they've really fine-tuned every aspect of it
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:18.420]  Yeah, definitely. And I think I think that they're going to cover a
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:23.460]  Incredible gamut of price points. I think that you know, and I think you know, I think 90
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:31.100]  90-some percent. This is another thing. We the Wall Street Journal had this goofy story two weeks ago about some sources in the supply chain
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:35.660]  It said that they expect to sell like 50 percent sport and 33 percent
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:40.140]  Steel and 16 percent gold. That's that's crazy
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:45.380]  I the more I think about the more I think that whoever told them that was just you know, I got screwing with them
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:47.380]  Yeah, just totally screwing with them
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.980]  Because there is no way well unless it's possible that I'm completely
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:57.380]  It's possible that I'm completely wrong could be that I'm completely wrong and the gold one is only going to cost
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:03.900]  I don't know fifteen hundred dollars or something. That's you know far more, you know in line with the
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.340]  349 price if I'm right though that it's even if I'm only right that it's five thousand let alone ten thousand to start
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:16.100]  There's no way that sixteen percent of the ones they'd sell they're not gonna sell a million of those a month. That's right
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.020]  crazy town
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:22.900]  Right. I mean like Rolex only sells I mean the Rolex is a very secretive company
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:27.500]  But best that anybody can tell is the Rolex sells somewhere around six hundred thousand
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:32.820]  Watches a year. There's some weird thing where they do they they they have to submit them to a
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:41.700]  The Swiss some Swiss government agency that's officially logical society. Yeah, it's like it's called COSC certification
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.580]  I don't know I could it that maybe one of those seasons is already a certification
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:50.420]  But it officially certifies it as a chronometer that the government agency does certain testing
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:56.140]  that's probably less rigorous than what Rolex themselves is but it lets them say it's an officially certified chronometer and
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:01.200]  That because it's like a government thing the numbers come out and it's something like Rolex certifies
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:08.440]  800,000 watches a year or at least they did in 2012, but that they might only sell six hundred thousand of them
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.900]  I guess you don't get the watch certified you get the movement certified the
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:18.480]  The okay, you know some of those might be for repairs or who knows but there's such they're they're almost Apple like in their secrecy
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:25.380]  And it you know, maybe it's just purposeful miss miss direction. Yeah, but it could be that they're you know extras for repairs or whatever
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:30.660]  But at the very least though long long way of saying that's just a baseline for what?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:36.420]  You know the world's premier luxury watchmaker sells in a year 600 rounds. It's almost a ceiling
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:38.420]  I mean not that Apple can't sell more
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:44.100]  But it's it's a likely ceiling right and a lot of Rolex's watches do not cost more than $10,000
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:48.020]  I mean a lot of them do but I think by volume, you know, a lot of them sell less
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.020]  So if the edition starts at $10,000, which I really do think it does
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:55.220]  The idea that they would sell a million of them a quarter
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:36:00.260]  In the first year, it just does not compute
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:06.260]  I mean and this is I think I don't think anybody would accuse me of being a pessimist on
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:13.900]  Apple, you know future Apple products success, you know possibilities, but I'm just saying that in terms of you know, just
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:19.460]  How the world seems to what work in terms of people who spend that kind of money on on jewelry
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:24.220]  It just seems out of scale. So I think the Wall Street Journal is not I think the addition is gonna be like
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:29.140]  I think they could I think the company could make wind up making tons of money on them because even if only like
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:36.180]  1% of the watches sold are the addition ones if there are 15,000 on average that's tons of money, right?
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.340]  It's 30 or 40 times. Each one of them is 30 or 40 times more expensive than a sport edition
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:47.660]  But there's no way it's gonna be that I don't think I think the vast majority of people are gonna come in and just buy
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:52.780]  A sport as though you know, like buying an iPod, you know, 349 bucks. Boom
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:37:00.140]  Right. Yeah, the the market for the higher end and the highest end ones is certainly going to be very small
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:06.380]  Compared to the market for a consumer priced watch. Yeah. Yeah, I know
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:11.300]  It's you know, there's so many weird psychological things to it to where it's like
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:18.480]  If they only had the one if they did what seemingly would be the more obvious route and just said here's the first Apple watch
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.280]  It's three hundred forty nine dollars. It comes in these colors
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:21.900]  That's it
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:22.780]  and maybe you know
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:28.340]  Maybe do the 38 and 42 millimeter size thing because there is sort of they're not calling it men's and ladies
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:32.940]  But clearly there's a sort of men's and ladies divide on average wrist size
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:40.720]  If they did that, you know, there'd be so many people who would say wow 349 bucks for a watch, you know
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.260]  You know, you're going to buy a fossil watch. It's you know, $75 or whatever
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:50.560]  There is that psychological thing where even if you don't even count the addition if you just look at the stainless steel
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.320]  If it's right next to a thousand dollar watch 349 looks a lot better
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.740]  Sure. Yeah
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:01.380]  So, I don't know. I think all of that goes into the strategy that they have here
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.780]  you know that that if they want to sell a
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:08.320]  gazillion three hundred forty nine dollar aluminum Apple watches
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:11.860]  That it helps them to do that by having these
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.620]  Seemingly inexplicably more expensive if you think of them as little risk computers
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:18.980]  Right next to them
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:24.240]  Well, and especially because they never break break down their sales based on model, right?
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:31.680]  so a quarter in or you know a year and they can say we sold you know, whatever 10 million watches and if only a
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.880]  Thousand of them are the addition watches. No one's ever gonna know
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:43.160]  Yeah, I mean I guess it'll do they break out the earnings based on I guess you could maybe calculate calculate it that way
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:43.480]  No
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:50.680]  But they've also said though that they've even said in advance so that nobody's disappointed that they're gonna be less transparent about the watch
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.720]  They're not even gonna put the watch as a separate item
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.560]  They're not gonna say they're not even gonna say we sold five million Apple watches. They're gonna go out
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.520]  Okay, they've they've created this new other category and watch revenue will will go in there
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.560]  It's gonna be very very difficult for outsiders to figure anything
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:13.280]  Yeah, and you know it to his credit Tim Cook is very clear about it, you know for the obvious reasons competitive
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.000]  You know, we don't want we don't want our competitors to know the breakdown
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.120]  All right, you go you want to do your last sponsor break? Yeah, I do and it's our good friends at hover hover
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:27.720]  You've ever heard of them the best way to manage domain names. I have heard of
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.880]  When you want to secure a great domain name you go to hover they have great tools
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:39.160]  So you type in whatever your great idea comm is, you know what guess what the dot-com is probably taken. They've got cool
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.120]  Maybe it's not though if it isn't you're done you can do it
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:49.600]  But they've got some cool features that will help you find either an alternate top-level domain other than calm or some other
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.080]  variation or spin on
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.400]  You know the words that you're looking to use
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.040]  To make it work with a dot-com great great tools
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360]  It could not be I
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:06.200]  Don't see how there's any hassle or friction that's left for them to remove from the process
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.640]  Like it's as easy and simple as it could get I don't see how they could get it any better
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:16.800]  In less than five minutes, you will be able to find the domain name you want and get it up and running
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.440]  You just search for keywords. They'll show you the best options and you go from there super clean and simple
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.840]  You don't have to mess around with any kind of complicated interface. I
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.600]  Always mentioned this but if you've ever registered domain names before and I've been registering domain names since
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200]  aspirin was invented in 1853
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.240]  It
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:46.120]  Notoriously, these are the worst websites in the world there. It's all SEO junk. It is all crazy upsells and
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.200]  Just it could not be a worse experience. They're always trying to you know, there's checkboxes that are checked like
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.760]  uncheck if you don't want to not have
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360]  Domain privacy security
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.120]  Added to your account what I don't know what that means and hover doesn't have any of that crap. No upselling
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:11.440]  Just straightforward up front pricing great deal great interface
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.120]  You don't have to upgrade for things that should be included for free
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.320]  Like who is privacy whose privacy is a big privacy is a big one
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:26.160]  Of course you want who is privacy if you don't have who is privacy. You're going to get terrible spam phone calls non-stop
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.520]  I got from back in the day before there was who is privacy
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.240]  Of course you want it. Well, almost every other domain registrar makes you pay extra for it
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.700]  Well, it's just baked into the price of being a hover customer
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:45.320]  And I haven't even mentioned the most amazing thing about hover, which is that they offer free
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:53.200]  Valet transfer service. So you skip the hassle. You've got domains at other lesser registrar's now
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:59.960]  Go sign up for hover then use their free valet transfer service. You give the the kind
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.480]  Competent trustworthy people at hover you give them that information, you know your login information for your other
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Domain registrar's
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  tell them you want to move your domains to hover and
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:19.320]  They just go take care of it and they make sure all the DNS is set right they go through whatever hoops
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:26.560]  The other registrar is gonna make you go through to transfer a domain. They do it and this is all they do is transfer domain
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.920]  So it's like I you know, I'll go years without transferring a domain. I don't know how to do it
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.720]  This is all the people at hover. Do let the experts do it
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.720]  It's it could not be easier sounds too good to be true because they do it for free
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.320]  But they do I'm telling you you just go there believe me you have domains at
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:47.120]  Some crappy registrar sign up for hover. Let them move them over and boom. You don't have to worry about it anymore
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  I
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:54.760]  Have no idea what the coupon code is for hover
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:02.700]  No, actually I do that they hover it gives me a new one every time and today's coupon code for this show is
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.160]  all one word
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.080]  spring training

[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.320]  They're making a baseball reference here on the talk show go to hover comm and use this code

[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.580]  I have a surprise for you then Paul. Oh
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:55.380]  Well, I'll tell you about it later
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:02.440]  After the show well before the end of the show before the end of the show, I won't make you wait long. All right
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:05.140]  Are you excited about spring training?
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.860]  It's too cold to be thinking about it yet seems impossible
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:12.780]  I know and I know I'm not trying to complain to you because Philly's had a bad winter
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.860]  Boston has had like
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:20.540]  Epic, like the worst winner in the history of bad winners like well, so at this point at this point
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:24.820]  We are I just saw it today. I think we're about three and a half inches off of the all-time
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:29.780]  Snowiest winter on record and it's only the beginning of March
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.500]  Well, but so at this point I'm rooting for just a little bit more snow
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:38.220]  Like we're at like 104 inches and the record is like 107 and a half inches or something
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.060]  I want to have lived through the snowiest winter of all time
[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:47.140]  I don't want any BS second place, right? So it's been terrible for like a month and a half at this point
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.140]  I might as well be a little
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:53.660]  Terrible for a little bit longer and then I'll have something to you know, put on my resume
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:45:00.060]  Yeah, especially since you can get there with you don't even need like a bad snowstorm. I mean, I'm talking
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:03.020]  Flurries for a couple days and we'll be set. Yeah
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:08.460]  I mean you guys you know at this point three four inches of snow you guys may they may not even put that on TV
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:14.580]  They may not even mention that now we talk in feet now. And yeah, it's it's been crazy. So yeah, I'm not thinking about
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.460]  I don't know. I the Red Sox I
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.260]  Get emails from them and I've been getting the information and I'm vaguely paying attention to it
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.740]  But I don't know. I don't really get into the spring training the baseball season's long enough
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:30.660]  How about that the kid from Cuba that they signed? Oh the 19 year old that they paid
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:36.500]  God only knows how much money for 63 million or something like that. Yeah. I don't know. What do you think Yankee fans?
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:42.300]  Yankee fans are starting to get antsy because if we've gone
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:49.260]  We've gone five years without a World Series and that's right around that's when the Yankee fans start losing their their shit
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:53.820]  And you know this it's just you know, it that's my hobby
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:58.460]  That's my you know, my you know, I like to watch the Yankees. I don't know if you knew that but
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.220]  one little rough
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:07.740]  Similarity between the Yankees and Apple is you know, the this crazy figure, you know
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:12.660]  Who who who's now dead who haunts the the organization the Yankees had George Steinbrenner?
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:17.660]  Apple has Steve Jobs and so you run into the you know
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:19.980]  Exactly like that. This never would have happened with Steve Jobs
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.340]  You run into this never would have happened with George Steinbrenner and now it's his kids running the team
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.040]  Which is really sort of a his care his kids Hal and Hank
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:34.840]  Are you know, I think they're doing an okay job. I think it's too it's it's too short of a period of time
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.720]  Yeah, you've got it
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.260]  It's you know, you're gonna have to give them 10-15 years before we really decide whether they're they're up to snuff as owners
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.760]  But with this what's the kid's name from Cuba? Oh
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  Like yo an Mankato or something. Yeah
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.280]  You know and it's so many of these recent players coming out of Cuba have been so good
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:01.020]  There's clearly so much crazy talent athletic baseball players coming out of Cuba
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.520]  But it's a ton of money for a kid who's nobody has seen play
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.120]  I mean, I'm not saying I would have been shocked if the Yankees had outbid the Red Sox
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.880]  But I don't think it's crazy that they didn't you know, but a lot of Yankee fans are you know?
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:21.400]  George's George is rolling over in his grave that he that and that in particular if he had been on the fence
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:27.000]  There's no way he would have let the kid go to the Red Sox right and there's the thing is there might be some truth
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.920]  To that, you know that because George the thing is is that George Steinbrenner made some moves that everybody agrees were terrible that he would
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:41.840]  You know insist on paying big bucks for like an aging slugger and everybody in the organization like would be on the record
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.880]  You know that we're not on the record, but like, you know
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.000]  Anonymous sources within the Yankees organization said that nobody nobody but George wanted this guy
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.520]  But did he overruled everybody and got him anyway?
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.680]  and
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:57.440]  At this point Yankee fans are like they miss that guy
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.800]  They want they wanted the Yankees to make terrible mistakes and just spend money on everybody that they should have said it's at least interesting
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  right
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.240]  And that ultimately they at least they want if the Yankees aren't going to win they at least want them to be
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:14.520]  Hemorrhaging cash as they do it
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:20.000]  And right because at least then they've done as much as they can right what more at least if they're burning money
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:27.800]  What more could we do we spent a billion dollars and we still lost whereas now it's it's it's starting to frustrate people that they're not
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.600]  that they're not just shooting money at the at the problems right and
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.680]  The Yankee D we got we've got
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.900]  Alex Rodriguez back on the team. Oh, that's a that's a treat for the rest of us. I'll tell you that much
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:44.300]  What do you where do you think he's gonna wind up this year? I?
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:50.980]  I think it is either going to be my guess is it's going to be
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.820]  binary he's either going to be a complete bust and
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:01.660]  unable to play and doesn't you know is like off the they're gonna have to like cut him and just pay him the
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:06.860]  $61,000,000 or he's actually gonna be okay. I think he maybe he'll hit like
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:11.700]  270 20 home runs 80 RBI's as as DH
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.940]  I was at the last I was gonna say you think he gets third base back or you think no
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:20.100]  I don't think so. It doesn't it sounds the Yankees are prepared for him to be DH
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.060]  I mean, I think he's got a chance to play third base
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:26.960]  But you know, they spend a surprising amount of money on chase Headley
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:31.020]  Yeah, exactly and you know clearly with the idea that they're gonna need him at third base
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:37.260]  I mean if if a rod can do it, I guess he will but I don't nobody really seems to be expecting that and they're also
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.080]  Giving them in Florida. They're giving them a lot of reps at first base
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.140]  Which which I think is as much about what we've got to do something with them
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.020]  And I think it's also like a sort of sad
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:53.780]  Statement about what they expect out of mark to share his durability, you know that they're already planning
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:56.420]  Oh, somebody's got it. Somebody else is gonna have to play some first
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:04.220]  Well, I think the what are they they signed him for ten years and then they resigned it for ten years like four years into
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.320]  That contract is that right? It's a very complicated
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:13.940]  Contract it is it something is something to the effect of that. Yeah. Well, I think the the original signing that ten year period
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.700]  It was it was an incredible amount of money
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:23.100]  But they got they got a lot of value out of that the resigning was where I think they went wrong. Yeah, definitely
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:30.340]  Because it's it's the second half of that new contract that is now, you know, they're paying in the 61 million for maybe nothing
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:39.540]  yeah, and the the thinking the entire thinking behind the resigning was marketing driven not baseball driven because it was
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:45.660]  All based it was before any of the PED stuff had hit obviously and it was all based on
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:53.860]  Projections of not not any kind of like oh, we think he's gonna play like his 33 year old self forever or his 32 year old
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.060]  Self, you know there they knew he was going to go into decline and that by the end of this contract
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:00.900]  He would you know be a shell of his former self
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:08.620]  But the projections all had him at you know, right around bonds his home run mark
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:14.280]  You know around that time and that he'd be breaking these historic home run records
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:21.480]  Filling the stadium with people, you know in anticipation of him, you know, getting a 700th home run getting a 750th home run
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.320]  Whereas now, you know, he could break the record and people are gonna throw the ball back on the field
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.280]  Right, I mean like who gives a crap about Barry Bonds home, right?
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:38.120]  You know, that's the thing is even if just imagine that he does met it
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:42.840]  you know physically come back in pretty good shape and actually does start hitting dingers again and
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.840]  plays out these three years
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.920]  It doesn't even matter if he breaks the record because nobody cares about the record anyway
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:53.720]  Because everybody thinks bonds numbers are tainted and then I'd be broken by the guys
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:01.880]  The only one who might be a more notorious user of performance-enhancing drugs. Do you even know bonds his home run number?
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.320]  No, I don't even know
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:10.840]  Ruth was 715 right right and and Hank Aaron 744, right? No, I think was 755 755
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.920]  755. All right. I knew it was a
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.040]  Double number. Yeah
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.920]  So bonds is more than that, but I don't know. I don't know how much more I'm gonna guess like
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:29.160]  780 he didn't get 800 right? I don't remember him getting another landmark after breaking the record and 800 would have been something
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.460]  Yeah, I know. I don't think it's it's something in the seven. It's got to be yeah, like 760
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:35.220]  I'm gonna look it up, but I'm not gonna cheat. Let's I'm gonna say seven
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.720]  770 okay. What are you gonna say? Oh
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:44.480]  I think it was even closer. I think he just barely I'm gonna go 760. I gotta go below you. So
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:50.880]  All right on career home runs. Here we go. This is a baseball reference calm
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:56.480]  This is good podcasted job, oh we fix it all in post
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.440]  Let's see here
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:07.920]  Oh Wikipedia makes it hard to find it to home run 762. You're right. He just kind of
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.200]  Snuck past him. He has seven more home runs than oh
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.800]  God, you know what have been classing
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:18.080]  He never would have done I mean cuz one thing when you're talking about Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.800]  Class doesn't really that is not a word wouldn't have been classy if he had stopped at some
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:28.480]  754 you think one less third time or time? Yeah, even if he just stopped at the top
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.480]  Yeah, even if he just stopped at 755
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:36.160]  Yeah, I feel like tied. Maybe you could have convinced him to do it. But one last I don't think you want fewer
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:38.160]  I don't think you would have gone for yeah
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:46.380]  No, all right. Well, what's what's the surprise you got for me John my surprise for you Paul is that we have a fourth sponsor this week
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.480]  All right, it is and you're gonna like him I know you like these guys and you like to play jokes with these guys
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.480]  It's our good friends at
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.480]  Fracture. All right
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:04.000]  I brought your photo swap. Yeah, this is now this we could talk about that is a great idea for a gag
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.360]  You guys know fracture. I talked about them. They've been sponsoring a show all year long
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.680]  they take your photos they print them directly on glass and
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:19.600]  You get a little package and it's right there. The glass has your photo right on it. You don't need a frame
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.320]  It is a frame you just hang it out. I'm gonna wall you can hang it up
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.680]  You know prop it up on your mantle or your desk
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:29.280]  a really clever packaging really great image quality
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.480]  Really great prices really great customer support all sorts of sizes
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:42.800]  And shapes to pick from you could do square ones print your favorite instagrams big ones, you know all sorts of great things
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:50.080]  Have you seen this ad campaign from Apple with the it's taken with an iPhone where they're showing like photos that people have taken with
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.560]  Their iPhone they're printing them on phenomenal photos. Yeah, they're phenomenal photos
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.480]  But then now it's like a billboard campaign like the like
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:00.480]  You just sort of forget like with the megapixels that you've got like, you know
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:04.600]  I'm sure if you got real close like when you're hanging if you're the guy hanging the billboard you can see the pixels or whatever
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.880]  but
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.640]  When I you know, you said you were in the Apple Store recently
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.560]  I was in the Apple Store just last week week or two ago and they have some of these
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.760]  Customer, you know your iPhone user photos up in the Apple Store
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:25.280]  Big printed really big like panoramas printed big and it's amazing how good they look even when you're standing right in front of them
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.240]  At the wall, like you can get go to fracture and get the big ones with your iPhone pictures. They'll look great
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.920]  It's amazing how much detail is in an iPhone picture
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:40.040]  Paul you and my wife have played games with fracture this describe the fracture photo swap, right?
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:45.720]  so fracture sponsored the podcast I do with your wife Amy a little show called just the tip and
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.880]  They sponsored the show and they it was actually their idea to do this
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.200]  they gave us each a coupon code and had us send a photo or photos to the other party and
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:02.760]  We trademarked this this is now a joint trademark between just the tip enterprises and fracture and you can participate in the fracture photo
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:07.600]  Swap all you do is you get together with a friend you say I'm gonna send you a photo you send me a photo
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.160]  And you just go nuts with it. And I have you talked pricing on this. I yeah, you haven't talked pricing
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.800]  You know, you can do it. It's it's very inexpensive for the small photos and
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.480]  You can have some fun with it
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.400]  The only rule is that whatever you send the receiving party has to keep in their house for at least a year
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.160]  Then it becomes a real conversation piece
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.720]  Which is so that you need to take that into account that explains why we have a photo of Pete Rose in his underwear
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.640]  His jockeys, that's right. That's right
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.920]  You're welcome. Thank you Paul
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.920]  It's the gift that keeps on giving
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:51.440]  Do you think that that was based that was an ad that that while Pete Rose was playing you could google this just google
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:55.520]  Was it Pete Rose jockeys? I think that's right. Yeah, it jockey underwear
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.120]  And he is he is not an attractive fan not even then no
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:09.160]  This is the height of his career. Yeah in the prime of his playing career did not really look like he was a jockey
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  Did not really look
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.040]  Very attractive in his jockeys
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:20.360]  Do you think maybe when they had that that maybe they got the idea and they just assumed that Pete Rose with his you know?
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.480]  His jersey off would look good because you know, there was like
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.000]  Jim Palmer
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:33.700]  very handsome pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles famously did a lot of underwear ads during his career very handsome man
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:39.260]  Looked amazing look best certainly look better than I've ever looked in the best day of my life in this underwear look great
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:44.260]  Look like he should be modeling underwear. Do you think that there's somebody at jockey was like, well, we'll get Pete Rose
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:47.260]  He's a great player. He's you know, he's you know, he's gonna look great
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:51.860]  and they said, you know, they called him and he's they came to terms and
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.500]  and
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:58.180]  They signed a contract and then then they then they got to see him in his jockeys
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:04.940]  I thought I think that's my guess as to how that came to be but they still could have saved money by not printing the ad
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:06.940]  I mean, that's good money after bad
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:13.300]  Well, anyway, my thanks to fractured send every you know, do the fracture photo swap. It's great fun
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:18.220]  Do whatever you want with them, but they'd great great company great products. Lots of fun
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:24.420]  The code that you want to remember is daring fireball all one word daring fireball and you will save
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:30.960]  15% on whatever it is that you order including I'm betting a fracture photo swap. There you go
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.760]  I one last thing I got to go soon
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:38.940]  We've been chatting for a while, but I wanted to talk while I had you because I wanted to get your insight on this
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:44.340]  I think you're gonna give me a big fat. I told you so about app pricing. So my oh, yes my friends
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.840]  Brenton Dave and I at Q branch
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:53.960]  We we've just a few days ago released a new update to our app Vesper that adds iPad support on iOS
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.280]  and
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:59.340]  Coincident with that to our universal binary, but we've raised the price of the app
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:06.880]  To 999 right? I think for the next 10 days. We're still gonna keep it at 799 which is higher than it has been all along
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.600]  but the red new default regular price once this intro period is over is going to be 999 and
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.080]  You know, I don't want to go on a trade about it
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:23.400]  but just more or less that we we've we've concluded that the idea that you can go low and we've been at
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:29.000]  299 for months before this update came out that you can go low and make it up with
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.000]  quantity because the iOS market is so big that it
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:38.380]  Just that just doesn't work or it doesn't work for the type of app that Vesper is which I would call like
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:43.160]  Deeper app. Yeah, and like a productivity app. It's not a game. It's not a gimmick
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:51.440]  You know, but it's sort of basically it's like the type of apps that indie developers have been making for the Mac for decades now
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.120]  it's on iOS like a Mac app on iOS and
[01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:00.640]  I don't think that that works and I mean Mac in terms of like being something that you do like you work with it you
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.880]  Do things productivity? I don't know. I
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.240]  Definitely do want to say I told you so but I think it's it's something where
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:16.540]  What six years ago my company released an iPhone app and we priced it at 999 and it didn't work
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:23.660]  But I felt like at least we went down swing and we went down at a price where we were content and
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:29.100]  I think exactly like you said trying to make it up on volume doesn't work unless you
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:33.060]  wind up with one of the apps, you know an Angry Birds or
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:39.540]  That's it. It's a game. It's it games are different. I think games are isn't it's a totally different market and
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:44.220]  You know, there's other apps that to me it's a different type of
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.220]  It's just a different category
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.660]  I'm talking you know, and I will also add and I don't want to be self
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:58.100]  So self-centered as to presume that Vesper is good enough that it should be making more money
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:01.740]  So let's just leave Vesper out. Maybe the problem is that Vesper isn't original enough
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:06.500]  Maybe that you know, the problem is Vesper the eye-opening thing to me was in panics
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:10.340]  Right annual letter that they published on their blog
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:15.580]  Back in early January where cable Sasser just flat-out said, you know, and they had a great year
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:20.100]  they had so many apps that came out Mac and iOS and they had iOS versions of
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:27.100]  Coda the mini coda whatever they call coda like coda diet coda diet coda
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:32.500]  Oh, what a great name that is. Can't believe it drew a blank on that. They have their terminal app
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.500]  Prompt prompt great great stuff
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:44.740]  Prompt prompt great great stuff transmit for iOS transmit for iOS, which is a phenomenal app really really well done
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:46.740]  It's everything you close your eyes you think well
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:52.180]  What would panic do if they did transmit for iOS and your mind starts running wild with how you know detailed it would be?
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.180]  Well, that's exactly what it is. It's
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.340]  remarkable remarkable app
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:01.740]  And truly I Mac caliber app in terms of the scope of what it does, you know
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:09.220]  It's a full-featured file transfer app, you know for a whole bunch of great services and you know in their annual letter
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.380]  you know cable flat-out said that the
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:18.060]  The revenue that they're making from these iOS apps doesn't justify the engineering
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:20.860]  expense of making these apps
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:25.580]  Compared to the revenue they get from the same amount of work on the Mac apps
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:31.620]  Right doing the same amount of work on the Mac is gonna pay so much better than it does on iOS, right?
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:34.100]  And there's no, you know, I mean there do different platforms
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:39.300]  But in terms of which you know it, you know how much it costs to pay for a talented engineer to spend
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:41.300]  You know eight to ten hours
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:48.980]  Tomorrow coding for it. It's the same right? You don't get you don't if anything iOS developers are more in demand
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.100]  Right, right. It's even harder to hire them
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.620]  And that to me was an eye-opener to me that if panic is saying hey
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:04.820]  Something funny is going on on iOS because you know, we're not getting the bang for our buck
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:05.260]  You know
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:10.020]  We have to think about how we're gonna do this because we can't justify this because if we put these resources toward the Mac
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:12.020]  We'd be making more money
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:15.860]  And that to me is an eye-opener because those apps are fantastic
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:22.380]  I there's just I mean it's you know, I'm too close to Vesper to judge Vesper objectively, but I can judge
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:26.580]  Panics apps objectively and they are best of breed
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.220]  Yeah, and yeah, I've got it right in front of me
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:36.180]  They basically they had a 50-50 split for iOS versus Mac sales and then the Mac was 83% of their revenue, right?
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:39.180]  So, I mean just in terms of the way the numbers work
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:39.420]  Yeah
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:46.100]  You certainly should be devoting more of your resources to the Mac and that's unfortunate because iOS is a fun platform
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:50.820]  It's an interesting platform to be developing for but right now there's the money just isn't there
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:53.980]  Yeah, and I think that we're starting to see it now like to me
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:59.740]  Eight years in I guess it is eight or seven years. I guess seven years since the App Store
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:08.740]  It's long enough and the devices, you know Moore's law has had its effect like our current iPhones and iPads are so powerful
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:13.700]  you know, they're cool, you know, the current iPads are clearly on par with the
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:17.740]  MacBooks of the time when the iPhone came out
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:24.020]  I mean the the devices aren't limiting them, but I really think that for seven years in there's a dearth of
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:31.140]  like what I would call like just name any of your favorite indie Mac apps from the last 20 years and
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:34.140]  We're not seeing them get developed on iOS
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:37.740]  I mean not that there's none but that we're just not seeing as many as we should
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:41.060]  well, and I wonder if I
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:44.700]  Definitely there are people inside of Apple who are aware of this
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:51.580]  But I wonder if the people who can do something about it are blinded by the fact that there are these phenomenal success stories
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:58.300]  Where companies come out of nowhere and suddenly make millions upon millions of dollars because they have this hit 99 cent app
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:04.060]  but it disguises the fact that so many developers try and fail and move on and
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:09.400]  Just can't really make a living at it. Let alone a good living at it
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:13.620]  Yeah, I don't know and you know and part of it and out
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:16.580]  You know because we could go on for an hour just about the App Store angle
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:23.060]  But part of it is clearly just that having to go through the App Store limits iOS development in certain ways
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:27.020]  But let's ignore that for now. I you know, I think it's safe to ignore it
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:32.340]  There's something more to it than that like you rogue amoeba. You guys don't have any iOS apps right now, right?
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:39.980]  we've got too small their companion apps to our Mac apps because that's what we felt has been the most valuable thing to do is to
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:42.500]  expend our resources on the Mac and
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:46.940]  We certainly want to be involved on iOS. It's like I said, it's an exciting platform
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:51.160]  But if the money is not there, we'd rather have them be a companion to a Mac app
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:51.560]  So, you know
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:57.060]  here's a free airfoil speakers which works works with our app airfoil and you pay for the airfoil app on the Mac and you get
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:59.060]  the the iOS app for free
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:00.620]  and it's
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:04.540]  You know, it's not necessarily the best way to do things, but it's the way that we found works
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:09.540]  I knew I remembered it. I remembered air for I didn't even think of it as an app because it's not you know
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:10.680]  I mean like to me it's not an app
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:15.860]  It's a thing on your phone that it's just part of it using airfoil, right? Exactly. So effectively
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:22.100]  Yeah, effectively you guys that were treating the iPhone the way that like it's like the Apple watch, right?
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:26.340]  It's just this little thing where you yeah, you're you've got apps for it and you've written code for it
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:31.780]  But it's really just a like you said a peripheral to the main thing. Yeah, exactly and and
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:38.340]  that that works but it's I would love to see the sort of thing that you're talking about where you have a
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:43.460]  You know first-class application experience on the phone or on the iPad and you know
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.780]  We can devote our resources to that and then charge
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:51.140]  10 20 30 dollars which is what you need to charge in terms of the volume that you're going to see on an average
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:52.740]  product
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:58.340]  Because you can't make enough money selling it for 99 cents or $2.99 or even $4.99
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:04.180]  And I think if I'm not mistaken in the in the panic letter that they sent out to that they post on their blog
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:10.580]  They also mentioned talking about discounted upgrades and that's a big thing that I think the app stores are lacking and have been lacking and
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.380]  it means that you need to
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:16.740]  either charge full price for version 2 or
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:21.700]  I mean, that's really pretty much your only option besides giving it away and
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:26.740]  Upgrade revenue is definitely a way that for 20 or 30 years now
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:33.060]  Companies have been selling software and making money and it encourages companies to make a version 2 and a version 3
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:37.700]  And not have to worry. Oh, we got to sell all over to people when they can just say hey
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.540]  This new version has a bunch of new features
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:43.380]  We think you're gonna like it because you bought the first version you get a big discount on it
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:45.060]  But we still get a little bit of revenue
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:49.220]  They don't just have to live off the revenue from the first product or try and sell a whole new product
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:52.180]  and I think not having that really sort of stunts the
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:08:00.100]  Ability to make deeper products and longer term products. Yeah, I'll borrow a tight to tie the whole show together bring it full circle
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:04.660]  I'll borrow a term from the watch world. There's a term in the watch world a tool watch
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:09.860]  So for example, like a diver watch a watch that can go 300 meters under underwater
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:14.500]  Which you think about it is terrifying. That's like that's an extraordinary depth
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:21.780]  You know watches that are meant to be you know treated roughly and you know to to work or or
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:28.180]  You know like chronometer watches like that race car drivers would wear and actually use you know to
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:34.500]  Time, they're they're racing and stuff like that. That's the type of apps. That's a good word tool right like tool apps
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:37.220]  Like, you know audio hijack is a tool
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:43.060]  It's a serious tool that people you can use it for fun too. But you know BB edit is a tool
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:49.780]  Right, those type of apps need continuous first for long-term success need continuous development
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:55.220]  Like you know you guys have been working on audio hijack like effectively
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:59.860]  I'm not that not that well non-stop right like for 13 years. Yeah, and
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:07.540]  There's no other way to do that without upgrade revenue or some kind of you know, like a subscription typing
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:12.020]  I mean clearly that's like what adobe is pivoting towards. Yeah and successfully
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:16.340]  I mean it it's or so far it seems like it but to justify that, you know
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:21.860]  because all of their apps that we think of they're you know, they're tools and the only way to keep them going is with
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:27.460]  Some sort of sustained revenue stream from your existing users and the whole idea that you know
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:31.860]  Once you've paid for it you get it for forever. It just doesn't work and anytime people have tried it
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:34.180]  It's always fallen apart. I mean I think of
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:37.620]  poor text mate right where
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.620]  Alan
[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:46.260]  Ogdard had great success, you know came out with a new text editor. It was a sensation all the rails developers loved it
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:51.700]  Really seemed to strike a chord with like the the new to the Mac users who you know
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:54.580]  Maybe didn't weren't for somehow turned off by
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.300]  BB edits sort of Mac likeness
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:02.740]  But then he promised that the next major upgrade was going to be a free update, you know
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:05.460]  And which I thought wow that is a crazy-ass thing to say
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:11.460]  Because I you know if it wasn't for upgrades, I don't see how bare-bones would still be in business. I I mean
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:17.140]  I'm sure that they still get some number of new customers, but you know, I I've paid for upgrades
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:20.100]  I even worked for them for two years, but I must have paid for I
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:23.300]  Don't know six or seven upgrades over the last
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:30.740]  You know 15 years of using BB edit right at well and the key is that it got you new features and new functionality
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:34.740]  Happily so right and got you. Yeah, you were happy to do it because it got you
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.700]  You know the the top-of-the-line product the current product
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:44.180]  And on on iOS, I think you're seeing a whole lot of stuff get abandoned because it doesn't make enough money up front
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:49.620]  And then you know, you can't you can't like I said earlier you can't keep throwing good money after bad
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:54.660]  Or you know good time after bad when a product isn't successful enough right up front
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:58.180]  It's not going to be successful long-term because you can't afford to make it successful
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:02.580]  Yeah, so my conclusion my new working theory is that for tool apps?
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:07.620]  That the market on iOS is actually not much bigger at all than the Mac
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:15.380]  It's roughly the same size and the fact that there are 200 million iOS users total is irrelevant because I don't know
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:19.700]  180 million of them would never even consider spending money on like
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:24.180]  Which to me is not a crazy expensive app like a 999 app, right?
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:28.820]  But it's just they're never gonna do it like the way that those 180 million users are going to do it
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:32.820]  is they go to the App Store and they search for what they're looking for and
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:39.140]  If it's a notes app, they type notes and then they look for one that's free and then they keep downloading free ones until they find
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:44.820]  One that's good enough and there's so many of them that they're eventually going to find one that's good enough and that's it
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:49.300]  And then never go past it. So it doesn't matter whether you're 99 cents or 199 or 999
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:54.260]  They're never looking past the free ones and well not that there aren't people, you know
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:12:01.540]  There's I think there's you know, same way that there's 10 20 30 million active Mac users who will consider spending a reasonable amount of money
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:04.580]  On a good app. I think that there's the same number of people
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:10.020]  I think that all those same people have an iPhone in their pocket and would consider doing the same thing for the iPhone
[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:12.340]  but there's
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:18.020]  You have to price it accordingly though. You still you can't price it for it at lower all 200 million people, right?
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:24.740]  You cannot do it and well, it might be less than the Mac version just because it's it's a smaller app and it does take slightly
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:26.740]  You know slightly less time
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:31.140]  To do the iPhone app than the Mac app because there might be you know, you don't have to do Apple script
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:34.180]  You don't have to you know, there's all sorts of things you may not be able to do
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.700]  But it still has to be commensurate to what you would charge for the Mac version
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:38.340]  well
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:43.380]  the interesting analogy to me is it's sort of analogous to the split between Mac and Windows that
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:49.060]  When we first came out on the Mac a decade ago more than that and had some success people said oh you should be on Windows
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:51.940]  There's you know, ten or a hundred times as many users
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:57.860]  But I think it's a very similar thing where there aren't ten or a hundred times as many people willing to pay for software
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.740]  Yeah, there might be more there might even be fewer
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:05.540]  But it's not as if you can just look at the size of the user base and say okay
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.660]  That's the possible number of people we can sell to
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:13.700]  And I think on the iPhone it's very similar where you know of those however 200 million devices
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:18.820]  How many of those are in the hands of kids or you know our secondary devices?
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:21.860]  So, you know, it's not really that there's that many active users out there
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:27.460]  Yeah, it's the market isn't necessarily that much bigger and you know, I you think it might be the same size
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:28.660]  It might be smaller might be bigger
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:30.260]  I don't I don't have a good number
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:34.740]  But I think it's silly to just look and say oh they sold so many hundreds of millions of devices
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:38.740]  That's obviously the market to attack. Yeah, I just think it doesn't actually work
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:42.100]  You have to pick a price that's commensurate with how you would price the equivalent Mac app
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:45.140]  And I really do believe that and it's you know
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:49.700]  And I but I realized that the App Store is not set up to promote apps like that
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:54.980]  You're not gonna get on the best-selling chart that way and being on the best-selling chart does get you downloads
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:56.340]  It's you know
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:00.820]  Well, the only the only thing that Apple added what a couple years in was the
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:07.780]  Top generating top revenue generating apps, right? And that's that's the one sort of SOP that we got that you know
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:09.780]  If you do have a more expensive app
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:12.980]  Potentially you could wind up on that chart and that that could be useful
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:18.580]  but I don't think it's in the end played out that way because I think that's a whole lot of that is in-app purchase stuff where
[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:22.900]  It could be a free or a freemium game type thing where you know
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:27.540]  You've got it for free and then you spend a whole bunch of money on coins or whatever and that's what we're talking about
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:32.020]  You've got it for free and then you spend a whole bunch of money on coins or whatever and that's what winds up topping those charts
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:38.100]  I think it's as you said that the stores just aren't set up to promote an app that is priced sustainably. Yeah
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:41.460]  Totally agree. So you were right. I was wrong
[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:49.060]  Well, I just I well I only wish you know, hopefully people listen and developers listen and say you know what?
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:51.780]  I'm not making enough money at $2.99 or $4.99
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:56.900]  I should try a higher price because that's that's really what it is is that you can't be the only one that does it
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.940]  That's what we tried it in the first place and it didn't work and even even someone like you who's got you know
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:07.500]  An audience who will listen to this. I don't know that it needs a title change from everybody really to make it sustainable
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:11.620]  Oh, you know ever since we wrote about it and Jason Snell of Lincoln and shown us
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:15.780]  Jason still had a brief interview with me about it today that I thought was came off pretty good
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:16.660]  I've got a lot
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:21.620]  we've got a lot of feedback about it and it does seem like I think that there's a movement of foot to maybe do this and
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:26.860]  It might have to it is I think hearkening back to almost the pre App Store days where we're you know
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:29.740]  You're gonna have to do your marketing on your own outside the App Store
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:35.340]  But that you know that that for a certain class of tool app that the prices I think are going to go up
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:37.340]  I think there's momentum. I
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:44.240]  Hope so. Yeah. Yeah, so let's wrap it up. But let's put a shout out to audio hijack. So audio hijack
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:47.060]  The new version is
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.720]  3.0, right? That's right. It is version 3.0 big hit
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:55.560]  For you guys at rogue amoeba. Do you guys have a patch upgrade up to 301 yet?
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:02.880]  302 and I think 303 will probably be probably not before this airs. But yeah, we're at 302 now. What's the price?
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.760]  It's forty nine dollars
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.880]  But if anyone has bought any audio hijack in the past any product with audio hijack in the name
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:16.880]  Which there were a couple different versions whenever it's a twenty five dollar upgrade. That's it's a bargain. That's absolute positive bargain
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.640]  I bet you get a lot of very well
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:23.720]  I'll bet there's a lot of diehard audio hijack users who are begging you to take their $25
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.320]  It has been incredible to get a whole lot of feedback from people
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:31.840]  Who have been using it forever and love the new version and you know
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:36.240]  I'm sure everybody who ever puts out a new version says this is the best version and Apple always says that but
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:43.200]  In this case, it's it's just been phenomenally well received to the point where I would not have expected it. Yeah
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.640]  well, I think it's really I had had your
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:52.280]  Your colleague Krista on a few episodes ago and we talked about the interface which is to me fantastic
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:58.240]  I think you guys got I think just from my sense from talking to Krista was that you guys got too close to the interface
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:02.720]  During its development and you lost sight of just how radically better it was
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.480]  Because oh in terms of the past several years of developing version 3
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:06.960]  Yes
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:14.040]  that you guys you guys were nose to the grindstone on that interface for so long and you became infamous intimately familiar with it and
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:20.780]  And then it came out and I think it was just I think it's that interface that's driving the hit because to me
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:25.200]  I always I always knew what audio hijack did but I have to admit that when I looked at it
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.280]  I was always a little like I have to I have to read and think about what I'm doing here
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:34.920]  Whereas with the new interface, it's in an instant. You can see exactly what is going on and it's you know
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:41.180]  Yeah, I mean that that was certainly the idea was we've got a pipeline and you can visually see my audio is going from here
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:43.560]  to here and it's doing what I expected to do and
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:49.200]  Previously we had most of the power that's in this version, but it was a lot more difficult to suss out, right?
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:55.040]  But and you know and on the back end you guys have been through so much. It's always been a Mac OS 10 product
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.760]  It hasn't it debuted on Mac OS 10. So you don't have any classic Mac OS roots, right?
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:06.160]  There was there was a plug-in version back on Mac OS 9 but as a product it was it's always been on Mac OS 10
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  You guys have been through so many technical
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:14.840]  differences in at the level that you that audio hijack needs to operate in terms of you know, I mean
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.840]  There was no core audio back in
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.960]  2001
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:20.960]  What's there? I don't think so. I
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:28.920]  Mean, yeah, we've gone through we've gone through what 11 different versions of the operating system and it's it's it's it's been it's been a
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.520]  Pretty long journey as far as getting to where we are
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.640]  But the only way that that worked was through upgrade pricing and having a sane
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:38.480]  Sustainable price to start with right? Yeah
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.840]  I think the bigger thing for us was having a price that you know made money as opposed to selling for 99 cents
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:49.040]  But certainly version 3 having an upgrade price has been essential right because there's no other way
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.000]  I mean, how could you justify three years of development on it if if you weren't going to do it?
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.300]  So anyway, my congrats well-deserved success on that app. It's thank you
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:02.560]  It should win all the awards in my opinion. Well, it's you know, it's funny. Somebody said that and
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:09.160]  It got me thinking there aren't very many Mac Awards left anymore. No week. Well, we lost Mac world's
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:15.780]  Eddie Awards, are they gonna do that? They didn't they didn't do it at the end of last year with their with their slim down staff
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.080]  You know, the the the ada's are now only for the App Store which audio hijack can't be in
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:29.080]  We lost I mean all the Mac magazines have disappeared and that was really the people that were doing a lot of the awards. Yeah
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:35.560]  So it's that actually somebody said that somebody said exactly that but it should win all the awards and and I said that's that's a lovely
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:42.900]  Thing to say and it made me depressed because there really aren't any of these sort of community recognition awards anymore. Yeah ada's
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:46.000]  You know, it's an achievement
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:48.840]  more than an award it
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:54.520]  Everybody if you get an ADA you've done good work. There is no way to get one that is not involve good work
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:59.720]  But it's it it's not really an award. It's you know, you you've done good work
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.040]  That is exactly where Apple wants you to be doing good work this year
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:08.960]  It's it's right, you know, not that again. I'm not downplaying it. I would certainly except I would happily accept one
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:12.880]  But it's to call it an award, you know, I don't know
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:17.400]  It's not like the Eddie's used to be where it was a more objective
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:23.800]  And had more of like a year-to-year fairness to it like the ada's shift radically
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:26.080]  I mean there was one year where they were like, you know iOS only
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:32.040]  well, and they had like they'd add a category like best dashboard widget and
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:36.680]  You know, it was clearly it was in Apple's promotional interests, right?
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:42.640]  Whereas right the the Eddie's and other awards like it were you know, just this is the best software and best products
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:45.140]  We saw this year, right? And and yeah
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:52.380]  I so the one that is I actually I emailed our friend Renee Richie at I'm or because they do an annual award and I said
[02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:54.600]  You know, somebody made me realize that so many of these are gone
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:59.800]  I'm glad that I'm or is still doing them and and you know, I certainly I hope we are in the running for one
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.560]  But ignoring that it's just nice that someone is looking at the whole community and looking at you know
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:11.260]  Everything as a whole and saying these are things that actually deserve some recognition and some attention. Yeah, there's the crunchies
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.520]  Doesn't that have like a gorilla statue
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:17.880]  I think it's got like a 2001
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:24.200]  Gorilla styles. Did you see I got nominated during fireball got nominated for the best bootstrapped startup
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.040]  This year this year
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:34.240]  What I just go look it up daring fireball was nominated in this year's crunchy awards for best
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:36.320]  bootstrapped startup
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:37.800]  this in my
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:44.480]  What 13th year for writing the website? Wow, did you oh you didn't win you didn't know it. Thank God
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:50.000]  Oh god, we got some kind of autoplay video. All right. All right, let's wrap it up my thanks to our sponsors
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.800]  We have four great sponsors this week
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:58.880]  My thanks to them all Casper the mattress people Warby Parker the eyeglass people who do not yet make monocles or eye patches
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:06.920]  Fracture your photos on glass and last but not least hover the world's best place to manage and register domain names
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:20.680]  Talk fastest. I thank you. Thank you. And you know get better soon job. All right, I'll keep an eye out for you
