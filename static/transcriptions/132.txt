[00:00.000 --> 00:07.120]  I'm worried because I feel like whenever you're on the show we always go and you're the by far the longest guest like if I feel like we could go
[00:07.120 --> 00:12.840]  Like if we ever needed to do like a charity talkathon me and you would be the two we can go for 12 hours
[00:13.840 --> 00:16.600]  And then this time we actually have a lot to talk about
[00:17.240 --> 00:23.560]  So I'm a little concerned, but well maybe not moving did you hear we don't talk anymore that that you got to me and
[00:24.760 --> 00:26.760]  that that somehow
[00:26.760 --> 00:31.880]  It with the specifics are are kind of vague as to how how you got to me and what that means
[00:32.120 --> 00:34.880]  But somehow you got to me and we don't talk anymore
[00:37.320 --> 00:42.280]  Has people said that have been further speculation that we're on the out. Oh my god
[00:42.280 --> 00:43.440]  I mean
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.760]  Fortunately, it's it's died down in the last few days. I think people have finally moved on
[00:47.520 --> 00:48.800]  From the peace saga
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.080]  Which is good the Internet has a very short attention span and that that is both a blessing and a curse
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.960]  It is it is definitely a blessing when you are on the receiving end of it
[00:57.600 --> 00:59.600]  so that is nice, but
[01:00.200 --> 01:07.320]  Yeah, I heard I read and got emailed and heard lots of interesting theories about the conspiracy between you and I
[01:07.840 --> 01:09.840]  Or that that you
[01:10.360 --> 01:12.360]  Got to me or paid me off
[01:12.880 --> 01:14.880]  Because people couldn't possibly believe
[01:15.480 --> 01:22.080]  That the story was what I said it was which is that I didn't want to be in this business after all so I exited it
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.520]  Right, you told this story on on your podcast the ATP
[01:27.200 --> 01:34.160]  Probably not what is now the last episode. I'm guessing you have an episode coming out tomorrow, but the today from last already out
[01:35.040 --> 01:37.040]  Well, I have no listen so
[01:37.040 --> 01:39.080]  You can stop me if we start covering some stuff
[01:39.080 --> 01:45.280]  But last week's episode where you covered the piece thing you're more or less long very a very long story very short is that
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.200]  What you wrote as always is exactly the truth?
[01:49.200 --> 01:56.520]  You you are one of the most almost painfully honest people I've ever met like where you you almost can't even bring yourself
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.760]  To tell like white lies
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.360]  You know, I mean it's it if you go through something like this and then you explain yourself in public you're what you say is the honest to God truth
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.960]  So it's very funny that everybody would just assume that it could be it was something else and I think the part of the story
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.160]  That is the best was that that and again, you know, people who listen to ATP last week know this that you
[02:21.160 --> 02:24.120]  I guess it was what last Thursday or was it a Friday?
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.400]  I don't know what day the week it was, but I was
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.200]  At the dentist and I was waiting to go and you texted me and you're like I think I'm gonna pull peace from
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.840]  The app store and I texted you don't don't do it. Don't be rash wait
[02:38.120 --> 02:43.080]  Wait tall and out of the dentist and I got home and it was already pulled from the app store and the thing was there
[02:43.080 --> 02:48.640]  I don't want to so I literally you did not you know pull a lot of people you had kind of made of you
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.320]  Obviously, you'd made up your mind because you know, I told you not to do it which we will get to I will explain why I thought you should not do it
[02:55.320 --> 02:57.320]  but
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.320]  It did amuse me greatly though then afterwards when they're I did notice immediately afterwards
[03:02.320 --> 03:07.040]  There were an awful lot of people who assumed that it was pressure from me somebody somebody more or less said that it was like
[03:07.040 --> 03:17.080]  That me and Kudal showed up with baseball bat that I would love to see that. It was especially funny because I was literally just
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.560]  Hanging out with you and Kudal like four days earlier
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.600]  Yeah, it was I also heard I yeah, I went over this briefly to me to people like I heard people
[03:28.600 --> 03:34.800]  People thought that Apple paid me off which is the funniest I think because like I was making them a ton of money
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.600]  You know promoting their platform and doing everything they wanted me to do
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.400]  And it wasn't also it also wasn't one of those things like
[03:47.200 --> 03:55.200]  Today view widgets right where they say okay now over here on this today screen on iOS. What's that called?
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.000]  Well, whatever you know, but you kind of get something you actually
[04:01.200 --> 04:03.200]  You can put a widget in there and
[04:03.200 --> 04:08.160]  And when I first opened this up there were people who made things that did things that were
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.360]  creatively outside the
[04:11.840 --> 04:20.080]  Perview of what they expected people to to make and then you know, so like I think one of the ones that was in an early victim of this was I think
[04:20.960 --> 04:22.960]  Peacock the calculator
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.560]  Maybe so you can actually do your computation over there. Well, that was more than they kind of I think they envisioned it as more
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.440]  Just like a status view like it would show you the weather or whatever, you know, and when people were actually doing real things over there
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.040]  Apple you know reacted. This isn't that sort of this because and it wasn't like they were
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.320]  Breaking, you know, wasn't like they were using private API's they were using the public APIs and ways that Apple didn't envision
[04:47.320 --> 04:50.960]  Well, peace was not like like you you use the content blocking
[04:51.200 --> 04:54.640]  API's in a way that they didn't envision it was almost like
[04:54.640 --> 05:00.880]  Right down the middle the canonical. This is exactly the sort of thing that they envisioned would be made
[05:01.280 --> 05:07.680]  Yeah, I mean like I the I got a couple of responses here and there from inside of Apple and they were all extremely positive
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.480]  Like they they they definitely did not want me to pull from the app stores far
[05:12.480 --> 05:18.960]  You know based on the implication that they would have hated it for some reason like I mean, you know, they're they're not
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.360]  Very generous with their communication
[05:21.360 --> 05:24.560]  but it sure seemed like people and Apple were big fans of it and
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.440]  and when I pulled it and
[05:27.840 --> 05:33.520]  Place the burden on them to try to issue all these refunds first manually and then eventually they did that batch thing
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.640]  That couldn't have been pleasant for them either and certainly couldn't have been cheap to have to process all those refunds and and you know
[05:40.640 --> 05:43.640]  Just the the manpower alone of processing all those refunds was
[05:44.320 --> 05:46.580]  Was getting to be probably significant so
[05:46.580 --> 05:53.860]  Yeah, yeah, the idea that Apple paid me off to do all this it was pretty entertaining. I also heard that
[05:54.660 --> 05:56.740]  Advertisers somehow paid me off. I
[05:57.780 --> 05:59.220]  Man
[05:59.220 --> 06:03.460]  An app that sits at the top of the app store paid app chart if that could have sat there for like a month
[06:04.020 --> 06:10.020]  I don't know if anyone else would have been able to afford to pay it off. I mean it was it would have made it to a ton of money
[06:10.660 --> 06:13.060]  And that's you know, that's assuming a lot of course, but
[06:13.060 --> 06:17.820]  It could have sat there for a while. You know that would have that would have been a good amount of money
[06:17.820 --> 06:24.860]  But you know, it's it's it would have the whole reason. I can't say it was it would have felt it would have felt like making a ton of money off of like
[06:25.060 --> 06:28.580]  Drug dealing or something like it didn't it didn't feel right. You know, that was the whole point
[06:29.700 --> 06:32.900]  I'm looking right now. I actually have not been paying attention
[06:33.620 --> 06:37.460]  To see what is a top the top charts so the top paid is
[06:37.460 --> 06:42.580]  Hooray tweetbot for well. I think today for me tweetbot. Yeah
[06:43.220 --> 06:49.220]  But number two yeah is purify. Yeah, but I think crystal was up there for a while and pure or purify
[06:49.220 --> 06:54.820]  I forget one of I think I have to you got to look at grossing now, but grossing is didn't even register. It's all candy
[06:55.300 --> 06:58.340]  It's all candy crush. Yeah, that's that's been up there for a while
[06:59.140 --> 07:03.620]  Well, I was at on on piece's top day the one full day of home a chart
[07:03.620 --> 07:07.660]  It was grossing that I think like number 17 or 18 for a little while not for the whole day
[07:07.660 --> 07:12.980]  But that was that was the peak and it it was able to fall down the grossing ranks pretty far
[07:13.300 --> 07:18.980]  While still being number one in the paid chart to give you know, like the volumes are much lower obviously in paid
[07:20.060 --> 07:24.420]  But yeah, it would mean any app that's gonna sit there anywhere like in the top 20 paid
[07:24.780 --> 07:28.700]  Is gonna be making really good money for a while so and now I don't you know
[07:28.700 --> 07:32.100]  If other people want to go in there and make a ton of money making ad blockers
[07:32.100 --> 07:37.940]  That's fine like I'm willing and happy to yield that ground to other people. That's why I did it
[07:37.940 --> 07:43.100]  You know, it's I got there realized. I really didn't like being there and left
[07:44.180 --> 07:47.100]  Yeah, I actually haven't looked in a while. It seems weird to me though
[07:47.100 --> 07:51.300]  I thought that there would be a couple up there, but it looks like it's all down to purify now
[07:52.420 --> 07:58.100]  It doesn't I don't see any of the others although maybe maybe they're in the free list and they're I don't know which one's popular
[07:58.100 --> 08:03.300]  I thought there were a couple that would be popular though for a while crystal and purify were neck and neck
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.700]  And then I think maybe pure foot. Maybe crystals
[08:06.420 --> 08:13.700]  Thing with the acceptable ads. They that's I mean that's a whole other drama that I don't really want to get into because I'm not involved happily anymore
[08:13.780 --> 08:18.740]  But it that's the kind of thing where it just shows how
[08:18.740 --> 08:27.860]  Incredibly messy and difficult this business is and it's a pervert example of why I don't want to be in it after all because it is just very messy and very difficult as
[08:28.420 --> 08:30.580]  We record on on Thursday
[08:30.580 --> 08:34.420]  October 1st crystal is all the way down at 32 on the top paid and
[08:35.220 --> 08:37.220]  Like I said purify is number two
[08:37.620 --> 08:43.220]  So obviously there's been some divergence there, but you you know, and there's this weird self
[08:43.780 --> 08:45.700]  Perpetuating that it's this you know
[08:45.700 --> 08:50.580]  We've talked about this is so many different contexts ever since the app store open, but once something is a top these
[08:50.980 --> 08:56.900]  Charts it tends to stay there because one of the ways that people people here. Hey, I hear there's odd ad blockers for iOS
[08:56.980 --> 08:59.380]  They go to the app store. What do they do? They go to the top chart
[08:59.700 --> 09:04.580]  They see one that looks reasonable at the top of the chart and they get it and by that time then they get it
[09:05.380 --> 09:06.980]  Purify works it you know
[09:06.980 --> 09:09.380]  Definitely does what it says on the tin so then they're done
[09:09.460 --> 09:13.860]  You know, they've just spent two or three bucks or whatever it costs on their thing and they're done and then none of the other
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.860]  You know, so being at top is a huge advantage
[09:15.860 --> 09:18.340]  So you you know peace having started at the top
[09:18.900 --> 09:22.100]  I think there's a very good chance that it would still be there today if you if you hadn't
[09:23.620 --> 09:28.820]  Yeah, maybe but at the same time like you know right now you could see like purify has already fallen to number two
[09:29.540 --> 09:33.780]  You know, we'll see you know how much it stays at the top or how much it falls over time
[09:34.180 --> 09:37.060]  I mean, it's only been a couple of weeks. It's been a pretty short time
[09:37.060 --> 09:38.980]  So I don't even know if I would have been able to be there for a month
[09:38.980 --> 09:41.060]  I don't even know if that would have happened. You know, there's no way to know
[09:41.060 --> 09:48.020]  But yeah, it doesn't matter like I also wonder how much this is going to be one of those things where it's not like
[09:48.420 --> 09:52.100]  Sustained you know not that it's not a sustainable business because I don't think it's that much
[09:52.580 --> 09:54.580]  Development work to keep it going
[09:55.380 --> 09:56.900]  But that
[09:56.900 --> 10:02.900]  Let's say 15 to 20% of iOS users might be interested in a content blocker
[10:02.980 --> 10:10.180]  Well how soon until all of them already have one and then then what I don't I'm not quite sure if it's going to be a charttopper
[10:10.180 --> 10:12.180]  In perpetuity
[10:12.300 --> 10:20.580]  Yeah, and we tried speculating on that on ATP like like what percentage of iOS people are likely to actually install and critically enable an
[10:20.900 --> 10:22.900]  ad blocker and
[10:23.140 --> 10:29.100]  We came to about 10% being our estimate of people who would actually enable it also because you have to like go through the settings
[10:29.100 --> 10:36.340]  Menu and dive into this Safari settings and actually turn it on and that in that convoluted settings things so then like the the idea that
[10:36.340 --> 10:42.180]  Ad blockers are going to all of a sudden ruin everyone's lives. I think it's
[10:43.060 --> 10:45.060]  unlikely and and probably exaggerated
[10:45.780 --> 10:49.460]  Yeah, I think it's likely I don't think it's likely that it would be
[10:50.180 --> 10:55.860]  That much different than on the desktop and then the desktop. I that I pulled the 15% from
[10:56.500 --> 10:59.140]  What I think is what people estimate is the desktop number
[10:59.940 --> 11:02.100]  And obviously that changes. Yeah, that seems really odd
[11:02.100 --> 11:06.180]  Change is a lot based on the audience. You know, I know ours technica first
[11:06.180 --> 11:11.540]  Oh, yeah, is really really hit hard by that because their audience is is technically adept
[11:12.100 --> 11:18.340]  You know my site probably is to some extent just because at least there's a high percentage of people who read my site who
[11:18.980 --> 11:24.020]  Know what an ad blocker is and you know feel very very, you know confident installing an extension
[11:24.820 --> 11:28.580]  It's also worth pointing out like you know that there's a lot of people
[11:28.580 --> 11:32.420]  So it's also worth pointing out that there's there's a lot of
[11:33.060 --> 11:40.020]  Like all those people who install the ad blockers who are like more likely to install ad blockers like like nerds who visit our technical and your site
[11:41.140 --> 11:44.420]  How likely were they to click on the display ads to begin with?
[11:44.820 --> 11:47.860]  You know like I bet the race. I mean, I've always kind of suspected that
[11:48.580 --> 11:52.740]  display ads on the internet are mostly supported by
[11:52.740 --> 12:00.420]  inadvertent accidental clicks or people who don't realize they're clicking on an ad who click who are misled
[12:00.980 --> 12:05.940]  Into clicking on it by it looking like content or by one of those like stupid story ads like, you know
[12:06.340 --> 12:09.220]  Top 10 ways to lift your face up like all those crazy things like
[12:10.100 --> 12:14.180]  I've always kind of suspected that the bulk of display advertising online was being
[12:14.900 --> 12:16.900]  clicked through and funded by
[12:18.260 --> 12:20.260]  Really accident or novices
[12:20.260 --> 12:22.660]  It's fueled by ignorance and confusion
[12:23.460 --> 12:28.260]  Yeah, and it's really it and you know, I'm sure that's I'm sure that's not all of it
[12:28.660 --> 12:30.660]  But I bet it's a lot more than
[12:30.900 --> 12:33.460]  Both the advertisers and the publishers would like to believe
[12:34.180 --> 12:36.740]  Yeah, well, it's it is truly a
[12:38.100 --> 12:43.380]  They truly opened a Pandora's box way back in the 90s when they first started
[12:44.020 --> 12:45.940]  Measuring clicks in the first place
[12:45.940 --> 12:51.060]  And I've linked to this over the years, you know numerous context talking about ads, but it's come back up again
[12:51.700 --> 12:54.100]  It it it is absolutely a case of
[12:55.300 --> 12:57.300]  Be careful what you measure
[12:57.780 --> 13:01.140]  Coming to bite them because at first when nobody was
[13:01.620 --> 13:06.660]  Trying to game the system at all the idea of counting the actual clicks on the ads was
[13:07.140 --> 13:11.460]  Amazing because nobody ever knew when you when you put an ad in a magazine
[13:11.460 --> 13:18.500]  You have a good guess that the circulation numbers are probably pretty accurate because they were you know
[13:18.580 --> 13:21.860]  Industry standards, you know, maybe they tried to fudge them a little bit for the most part
[13:21.940 --> 13:25.140]  It was so expensive to print magazines. They couldn't be that far off
[13:26.100 --> 13:32.340]  But how many people actually read your ad if it's on page 13 or you know how many people skip right past it?
[13:32.340 --> 13:38.500]  You know, what what was the register to actually be able to measure it in a meaningful way, you know TV commercials could never really be measured
[13:38.500 --> 13:47.780]  If it if there was no gaming if everybody was honest in the world, which is probably the biggest stupidest if I've ever put forward
[13:48.900 --> 13:53.140]  Counting the clicks on ads would be great and it did at first
[13:54.020 --> 13:59.060]  Web advertising was like super super expensive like in a per customer
[14:00.020 --> 14:02.980]  You know, however you want to measure that because it could be measured
[14:03.940 --> 14:05.940]  But then as soon as people could you know
[14:05.940 --> 14:10.580]  As soon as that started working people immediately started gaming in various ways
[14:11.140 --> 14:14.020]  So it's you know once and once they started going down that path
[14:14.020 --> 14:18.100]  It was doomed and still is to this day the fact that they tried to measure it
[14:19.300 --> 14:24.180]  Right because and then you have all these problems with click fraud and botnets doing click fraud and all this stuff
[14:24.900 --> 14:29.380]  It's it's this whole world of people trying to rip each other off
[14:30.100 --> 14:34.500]  It's just disgusting to me that's again. It's one of the reasons why I didn't want to be in the business after all
[14:34.500 --> 14:39.460]  Just it's just it's just a dirty messy world at a fundamental level
[14:39.460 --> 14:45.940]  The way I view advertising is even online is that it's fundamentally no different than advertising in print or on TV
[14:46.340 --> 14:50.420]  And which is to say that it is primarily about awareness
[14:50.900 --> 14:56.420]  Making people aware maybe people who've never heard of your product making them aware of it for the first time or if they have heard of it
[14:56.980 --> 15:02.660]  Reinforcing it with your brand, you know, you know, if it's some kind of visual ad
[15:02.660 --> 15:06.820]  Or with some kind of message about it like for example like the ads
[15:06.820 --> 15:12.660]  I'll be reading during this podcast where you're not seeing anything, but you can hear these talking points
[15:12.660 --> 15:14.660]  Here's what they want you to know about it
[15:15.300 --> 15:18.740]  So that you have it in your head so that if you need a new mattress
[15:18.740 --> 15:23.380]  You can think well, what about that one that all these podcasts are talking about or something like that
[15:23.380 --> 15:28.180]  Just so it's in your head awareness the fact that online ads can actually lead to
[15:28.900 --> 15:30.820]  engagement quicker
[15:30.820 --> 15:37.300]  Meaning, you know, you can just click on an ad and go and you're already at the field notes website
[15:37.300 --> 15:40.500]  And you can buy the notebook right there that that's great
[15:40.500 --> 15:45.780]  But that should just be at you know anybody who's deciding how much to spend online versus print or on TV
[15:45.940 --> 15:52.020]  That should just be icing on the cake. It's still should primarily be look if we put an ad on this website
[15:52.020 --> 15:55.060]  We think we're gonna we can expect 100,000 people will see it
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.420]  And we roughly know that they're you know the demographics are like this
[16:01.060 --> 16:05.940]  That's really all they they should be looking at but the fact that they think that they can like identify people
[16:06.020 --> 16:13.780]  You know, we'll spend this money and it'll only go to people who've searched in Google Maps for an oil change in the last 25 days
[16:14.260 --> 16:17.780]  It's just crazy and it leads to all sorts of sickness
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.140]  Yeah, and all sorts of really
[16:21.140 --> 16:26.820]  Creepy and perverse incentives and behavior like it's it's one of those worlds where
[16:27.780 --> 16:29.780]  anybody who who is
[16:30.100 --> 16:35.220]  Kind of privacy and and sensibly minded or anybody who has really strong
[16:35.860 --> 16:38.900]  Ethics I think is often driven out of that business
[16:39.380 --> 16:41.700]  Like because if they won't do it someone else will
[16:44.180 --> 16:46.180]  You guys on ATP you guys compared it
[16:46.900 --> 16:48.180]  to the
[16:48.180 --> 16:52.180]  Pornography industry and then I think you guys kind of backed away from it because it's almost like wow
[16:52.180 --> 16:58.340]  That's a real strong comparison, but I actually think it's actually really I think that's not a bad comparison at all in terms of
[16:59.940 --> 17:07.780]  That you're it's not you know remove any judgment of whether the existence of pornography and of itself has any sort of moral
[17:11.780 --> 17:16.660]  You know any kind of moral quandary that you should be pondering it's just that you end up in
[17:16.660 --> 17:24.820]  Programming and doing things that are you know whoever's implementing it is unhealthy, right? That if you know
[17:27.780 --> 17:30.900]  If it's some kind of paper thing for porno you
[17:31.460 --> 17:39.060]  You know that they're they're set up in a way somebody had to program the system that enables somebody who's got like an addiction to the stuff to
[17:39.060 --> 17:41.060]  Just keep spending as much money as they can
[17:41.780 --> 17:43.780]  That's you know
[17:43.780 --> 17:50.180]  That is absolutely immoral. I mean and and either somebody feels really guilty about that or somebody who wrote that code
[17:50.500 --> 17:52.820]  Just doesn't have a moral compass that points that way
[17:53.780 --> 17:57.060]  A lot of this stuff the programmatic stuff and advertising is
[17:58.020 --> 18:03.060]  It's down that path, you know, it's maybe not quite as far, but it's it's pretty pretty bad
[18:03.940 --> 18:08.500]  You know that you're doing things that you know that the user isn't happy about that isn't good for them
[18:08.500 --> 18:12.100]  And that they wouldn't want to know exactly what's going on
[18:13.620 --> 18:16.580]  Right and and one of the problems that that you know
[18:16.580 --> 18:21.700]  So that's the side of the advertiser the side of the ad blocker of like the person or company
[18:22.660 --> 18:24.980]  Making and running the ad blocker itself
[18:25.780 --> 18:32.820]  That faces an interesting dilemma where and I think you see this playing out with this acceptable ads thing with ablock plus and crystal and the
[18:33.060 --> 18:35.060]  Controversy this has stirred up
[18:35.060 --> 18:40.100]  The and and some things you said about the deck and everything and how the deck had their privacy policy and everything and whether
[18:40.100 --> 18:44.180]  You know the question of whether the deck should be should count as an advertiser that should be blocked
[18:44.740 --> 18:49.380]  One of the problems here. I face this with insta paper back forever ago
[18:50.340 --> 18:52.340]  I faced the problem that
[18:52.740 --> 18:54.740]  What people actually wanted
[18:55.300 --> 18:59.540]  Was to get the articles without ever viewing the ads won't even once
[18:59.540 --> 19:06.660]  They wanted me to go out and scrape new articles for them. They'd never seen before and show them immediately in the in the ad strip
[19:06.660 --> 19:07.860]  Text view
[19:07.860 --> 19:13.460]  Like that's what people actually want and what's actually healthy for publishers and for the world and for me
[19:13.540 --> 19:16.980]  Legally was not to do things like that. It was to say, you know, okay
[19:16.980 --> 19:24.980]  Well, I'm gonna save things you have viewed in your web browser, you know, like that's that's different and it was it was always a really tricky balance because
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.660]  The the user base, you know, the the customer the market was pushing me to go over that line
[19:30.660 --> 19:32.980]  And I would always try to hold back a little bit
[19:33.300 --> 19:37.540]  But not all my competitors did and that hurt me and I think in the ad blocker industry
[19:37.540 --> 19:39.780]  I think you you're gonna see you see the same thing which is
[19:40.500 --> 19:43.700]  You know, we can talk all we want about how like you know, well
[19:44.340 --> 19:49.380]  Like I also want it to be a comparative kind of to piracy and it's not these aren't great comparisons
[19:49.380 --> 19:53.060]  So please don't email us, but you know, it's it has some overlap
[19:53.060 --> 20:00.100]  It is is what I will say about that and in the sense that like, you know, making an ad blocker is kind of like making money from piracy
[20:00.100 --> 20:05.380]  It's like well people are gonna pay me to hide everyone else's ads and I can say
[20:05.940 --> 20:11.620]  Well, I can justify it with reasons x y and z many of which are perfectly valid things like security tracking creepiness
[20:11.620 --> 20:12.020]  etc
[20:12.020 --> 20:14.020]  Those are all very valid reasons
[20:14.420 --> 20:21.060]  But if I made an ad blocker that only blocked tracking and still showed ads
[20:21.060 --> 20:29.940]  Nobody would want it because what people actually want is to block all the ads and all the tracking and the and the security and the creepiness
[20:30.100 --> 20:34.260]  Those are all convenient justifications for them just like when people pirate stuff
[20:34.260 --> 20:39.140]  They say well it wasn't available in my country yet or it wasn't available without DRM in the format
[20:39.140 --> 20:42.260]  I wanted on the box I wanted to play it on whatever like people can rational
[20:42.260 --> 20:46.740]  So all sorts of reasons for piracy while also knowing yeah, it's also kind of not right
[20:46.740 --> 20:50.820]  And so that's that's how I was feeling about ad blocking when I when I quit was like
[20:51.860 --> 20:55.300]  I could rational it's a whole bunch of reasons why this needs to exist and
[20:55.940 --> 21:00.660]  Why I might even want to still run mum which I do right now. I still run ghostery on my computer and I still run
[21:01.220 --> 21:06.820]  I'm switching between various blockers on my phone trying to find a good one. I'm currently using one blocker
[21:08.340 --> 21:10.500]  You know people people were actually these reasons
[21:10.500 --> 21:15.140]  But to be the person making it and enabling this and making money from it even
[21:15.140 --> 21:19.940]  It puts it on a different level and there's always going to be this tension between
[21:20.580 --> 21:23.220]  You know trying to make it seem morally acceptable
[21:24.180 --> 21:27.940]  but also the reality of what the market really wants
[21:28.500 --> 21:34.660]  Is to get everything for free and to not see any ads ever and no matter what they say if they if they say it's all about something else
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.660]  It's all about tracking whatever
[21:37.060 --> 21:41.700]  Some people are honest about that most aren't most people just want to block all the ads. I disagree
[21:41.700 --> 21:47.060]  I really do disagree. I think there's definitely some subset of people who really do want to block the ads really do
[21:48.260 --> 21:50.260]  You know sort of the
[21:50.260 --> 21:52.900]  What's that there's even a magazine what's that called?
[21:54.420 --> 21:56.420]  Sort of like an anti advertising magazine
[21:57.620 --> 22:02.500]  We need a summary ports. No, no, no, it used to they used to sell it at Whole Foods, but they don't anymore, but it's
[22:04.660 --> 22:06.020]  It'll come to me
[22:06.340 --> 22:08.340]  Need a goddamn forum like you guys have
[22:08.340 --> 22:17.060]  It's people who are opposed to advertising in general not just online advertising, but who actually are crusaders about the
[22:17.700 --> 22:20.500]  You know that that advertising is a perverse force on
[22:21.780 --> 22:23.780]  on our society
[22:23.780 --> 22:27.860]  You know and in obviously you don't have to go far to find cases. There's there are some cases where it is, you know
[22:28.740 --> 22:33.060]  You know the cigarette companies and the advert, you know the way that that they've been
[22:33.060 --> 22:41.380]  That legislation has been passed that you they really can't advertise anymore and that when they used to be able to they really did
[22:41.380 --> 22:46.660]  You could prove it that they they targeted their ads to children
[22:47.300 --> 22:53.860]  Um, you know famously the Joe Camel cartoon mascot for camel cigarettes was
[22:53.860 --> 23:07.540]  You know talk to kindergartners and they're amazing amazing brand awareness in kindergarten age kids of the mascot for a cigarette company
[23:08.020 --> 23:12.340]  That's really sick and it wasn't an accident. It was actually planned. So yeah, that's it. You know
[23:12.340 --> 23:18.740]  There's an example there are people who kind of feel that way about all ads and and and maybe it's not even the messaging
[23:18.740 --> 23:22.020]  There's others who are clearly online who really care about
[23:22.020 --> 23:24.020]  Every single bite of data
[23:24.980 --> 23:26.980]  every bite
[23:26.980 --> 23:34.660]  Somebody pointed out to me for example and and with daring fireball in the deck the deck ads are so small compared to online ads
[23:35.380 --> 23:40.180]  You know in general but because daring fireball has almost no images
[23:41.300 --> 23:45.540]  Oftentimes has no images other than like the logo on the whole homepage
[23:46.340 --> 23:48.340]  the deck actually
[23:48.340 --> 23:55.380]  Comprises a significant portion of the average page view especially if you don't even look at the whole homepage where there is a whole big wall
[23:55.380 --> 23:57.380]  Attacks, but if you just go to like an individual
[23:58.740 --> 24:00.740]  Short entry
[24:00.980 --> 24:05.940]  Significant portion maybe even a majority portion of the bites that get downloaded on the page view go to the ad
[24:06.500 --> 24:11.300]  I think looking at that as a percentage is kind of unfair just because of the design of daring fireball
[24:11.300 --> 24:13.300]  But if you really want to look at it that way
[24:13.300 --> 24:18.500]  Okay, fine. I say go ahead block the ads, you know, but I don't think a lot of people feel that way
[24:18.500 --> 24:22.340]  I think people the thing that's opening people's eyes with this
[24:23.300 --> 24:27.780]  With with the content blocking are the performance numbers that people are seeing
[24:28.180 --> 24:33.540]  Yeah, I think when I see people whose eyes have been opened by like some of the stuff like that then Brooks has been publishing what he's
[24:33.540 --> 24:36.500]  You know doing the yeoman's work of testing all these things
[24:36.500 --> 24:44.660]  And the New York Times published a thing today where they they tested a bunch of sites with ad blockers and when you see that you can
[24:45.140 --> 24:50.020]  Save 30 seconds on a mobile page view when you go to Boston.com by having an ad blocker
[24:50.500 --> 24:54.420]  I don't think it's about blocking ads. It's I just want my I want that speed increase
[24:56.660 --> 24:59.060]  Yeah, and that's that's certainly a major part of it
[24:59.300 --> 25:02.100]  That is a major justification and a major motivator
[25:02.100 --> 25:06.740]  Especially on mobile, you know on desktop. It was it was easier to get wasteful and kind of ignore it
[25:06.740 --> 25:10.420]  But a mobile it matters more on mobile also screen space matters more
[25:10.420 --> 25:16.180]  You know like the ads that would come in and take over a massive chunk of the screen or do these stupid overlays or break when you zoomed
[25:17.220 --> 25:24.580]  So many bad ad things out there, but it's a major motivator, but I think it comes a bit comes down to like
[25:25.700 --> 25:30.020]  If you ask people would you rather see this thing with ads or with no ads?
[25:30.020 --> 25:32.340]  They would choose no ads every time
[25:32.580 --> 25:37.060]  You know obviously there's some exceptions like you know like certain magazines where like the ads are kind of the point
[25:37.540 --> 25:42.260]  But for the most part most content. I think people if people were given the option to take it with no ads
[25:42.420 --> 25:46.340]  They would take that option, you know assuming the cost was equal and probably both free
[25:46.660 --> 25:52.100]  And so what you have in the abdiness is this kind of tension this this kind of balance tension
[25:52.900 --> 25:54.900]  Well usually it's balanced where
[25:54.900 --> 26:00.340]  The people really want the stuff for free and they don't want to pay they don't want to pay for it
[26:00.340 --> 26:05.140]  And they also don't want to see ads and the publishers, you know, they obviously cannot pay for free
[26:05.140 --> 26:09.140]  So like they say all right. Well, we'll kind of reach this equilibrium like okay
[26:09.140 --> 26:13.060]  Well, we're gonna show ads and most of you are going to tolerate them
[26:13.860 --> 26:17.620]  And you're gonna tolerate it because you don't want to pay us and it's kind of okay
[26:17.620 --> 26:20.340]  And for the most part both sides that
[26:21.060 --> 26:23.220]  Usually it's this it's this at this
[26:23.220 --> 26:26.900]  Relationship of tolerating you not actually
[26:27.540 --> 26:29.380]  Wanting the ads you're enjoying the ads
[26:30.020 --> 26:32.340]  You know most people if given the choice again
[26:32.340 --> 26:37.300]  They would they would say well, I don't have to see the ads then don't show them to me or don't waste my time with them
[26:37.940 --> 26:42.420]  So it's always this kind of tension and in in the in the grand scheme of things
[26:42.420 --> 26:46.340]  I think people do like free content better than they like paywall stuff
[26:47.140 --> 26:49.140]  So ultimately I think I think this is a
[26:49.140 --> 26:53.940]  Necessary evil like it's and obviously this is always evil, you know
[26:53.940 --> 26:55.940]  But it's a necessary
[26:55.940 --> 27:01.380]  Compromise of of how how content is viewed and paid for and everything and you know
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.980]  I run the deck ads on my site
[27:02.980 --> 27:08.100]  I run ads on my podcast just like you do on here and that's those are both choices where it's like, you know
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.380]  I also
[27:09.380 --> 27:14.020]  You know, I I would love to do an ad-free podcast for people just paid us
[27:14.020 --> 27:19.060]  But that would make a lot less money. I'm to reach a lot less people
[27:19.460 --> 27:24.020]  And you know if you put a paywall up in front of a podcast that is just death like nobody listens
[27:24.980 --> 27:26.980]  so it's it's really
[27:27.780 --> 27:29.780]  It's it's never a great
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.860]  Relationship it's never perfect
[27:31.860 --> 27:34.500]  You know, it's never really what all sides want
[27:34.900 --> 27:39.700]  But it's this compromise that all sides have reached most of the time and anything you do to throw that out of balance
[27:39.700 --> 27:46.820]  Like making the ads are really obnoxious or really creepy or really overreaching or really slow or have other major problems
[27:47.620 --> 27:52.900]  There's going to be pushback from that, but the basic the basic notion of
[27:53.780 --> 27:55.780]  I'm going to show you ads and you're going to tolerate them
[27:56.500 --> 28:02.980]  It's it's a little bit uncomfortable even from the start. Yeah, you know, and it's I've always I've always kind of felt
[28:02.980 --> 28:09.220]  mildly irritated by the fact that I that I make my living on ads because I
[28:10.020 --> 28:15.380]  Don't like ads, you know, but but I think this is the best solution we have given all the variable
[28:15.380 --> 28:20.660]  I think that's where the comparison to piracy works as I've always seen piracy as a
[28:21.460 --> 28:24.500]  Negotiation it is you know
[28:26.020 --> 28:28.980]  Somebody if they're pirating an app or a game
[28:28.980 --> 28:36.420]  They're the you know, the whoever makes the game is saying here. It's here's a new game for your PC
[28:36.580 --> 28:37.540]  It's
[28:37.540 --> 28:42.820]  $40 and the person who pirates hit instead of paying for it is saying no, it's zero dollars
[28:43.460 --> 28:48.100]  And at some point and I know that you know with piracy there are absolute
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.660]  They're at dieards, you know, and there are people, you know, kids
[28:50.660 --> 28:53.460]  I I when I was you know in college I pirated all sorts of stuff
[28:53.460 --> 29:00.020]  And it wasn't wasn't like if Adobe had to have to the price of photoshop
[29:00.020 --> 29:02.260]  I was gonna pay for it instead of pirating it
[29:02.820 --> 29:11.220]  I realized that but you know for some things at some point it's it and I think that that was the key to the iTunes music store
[29:12.260 --> 29:15.700]  Making online music a a success is that it
[29:16.580 --> 29:20.740]  They they were saying here's a better deal. We will have all the music you'll get your album art
[29:20.740 --> 29:24.260]  It'll all have good metadata right there. You'll you'll be sure of the quality
[29:24.900 --> 29:30.980]  And it's a fair price 99 cents and did it stop music piracy? No, definitely not
[29:30.980 --> 29:34.260]  But it definitely turned some people who might have otherwise or previously
[29:34.820 --> 29:40.900]  Been using Napster or you know, whatever the you know the stuff that came after Napster was to instead just say you know
[29:40.900 --> 29:42.900]  What I'll just buy it from items. It's a negotiation
[29:44.180 --> 29:48.660]  I think what you see and it's the same thing with a lot of piracy and you see it with entertainment industry
[29:48.660 --> 29:52.180]  And the way they approach movies and stuff like that and
[29:52.980 --> 29:54.980]  Music and games and software
[29:55.780 --> 30:01.020]  And I think it's very true with the advertising industry is that the industry the publishers and the advertisers
[30:01.860 --> 30:05.180]  Or the entertainment companies. They don't see it as a negotiation
[30:05.180 --> 30:09.700]  They see this as a problem that could be solved so that they can do whatever they want and
[30:09.700 --> 30:17.620]  Them the people will just take it. We can we can show you whatever online ads we want and you'll just suck it up
[30:18.900 --> 30:24.900]  That's in that there's some you know, I'm sure that there's a whole bunch of people who are if they're looking at
[30:25.700 --> 30:32.900]  Wow, our mobile numbers are down this month. You know this iOS content blocking thing is totally real. It's you can see it here
[30:32.900 --> 30:34.900]  You know five six seven percent down
[30:34.900 --> 30:38.740]  You know over where we were before this came out
[30:40.660 --> 30:47.900]  You know that there's people right now who's who are thinking or who are demanding of their engineering teams find a way around this
[30:47.900 --> 30:52.860]  So not not like how do we you know, how do we start selling ads that people don't want to block?
[30:53.220 --> 30:55.900]  It's how do we defeat the content blockers and
[30:57.860 --> 31:00.820]  You know, I think that's the wrong attitude. That's not that's not gonna win
[31:00.820 --> 31:02.820]  Exactly
[31:05.860 --> 31:07.860]  Um
[31:08.180 --> 31:14.820]  So right but but on the other side when they make new kinds of ads then the ad blocker people are gonna say
[31:15.060 --> 31:19.380]  Well, now we need to block this new kind of ad like the neither side is willing to
[31:19.620 --> 31:23.620]  Agreed to the other side's terms here like the the advertiser is not gonna say well
[31:23.620 --> 31:29.820]  I guess we better stop publishing ads because nobody likes ads and the ad blockers aren't gonna say well
[31:29.820 --> 31:35.860]  You know what that ad is fine. We're gonna publish that one because if they do the user revolt and they go to something else
[31:38.020 --> 31:43.420]  So I yeah, I don't know what the ultimate solution is, but it's it's absolutely some form of having a
[31:43.820 --> 31:51.740]  basic respect for the user and for your product and I've been saying the following three years as well is to me
[31:51.740 --> 31:55.500]  I somebody who's always been sort of obsessed by publishing and
[31:55.500 --> 32:02.300]  Advertising and graphic design and branding and things like this whether it's, you know print or TV or
[32:03.820 --> 32:09.260]  Online it has always been right from the very get go. It has always been very clear to me that
[32:09.740 --> 32:14.660]  The traditional companies either from TV or from print when they went online
[32:15.340 --> 32:21.140]  By and large they had very little to no respect for the web. They either treated it as like
[32:21.140 --> 32:28.500]  At some point they had to stop treating it as as maybe a fad, but clearly at the beginning a lot of them thought maybe this is a fad
[32:29.140 --> 32:36.340]  And they never ever treated it with the respect that they treat their main products, you know, they would never put
[32:37.140 --> 32:43.380]  Pop up that actually covered the actors faces faces on a TV show, right? Wherever you want to say about?
[32:44.100 --> 32:50.460]  You know even when they put they do some stuff that still annoys me on TV like where they'll put little things up at the bottom of the screen
[32:50.460 --> 32:56.300]  But they don't do something that covers the actual whole content of the show while the show is playing
[32:58.380 --> 33:03.260]  Magazines don't allow advertisers to make ads that like tape pages
[33:03.820 --> 33:07.820]  They're getting worse every year with that. Well, you know the print is getting desperate
[33:07.820 --> 33:12.060]  They it might be out of desperation, but certainly while they were profitable they wouldn't do it
[33:12.060 --> 33:16.540]  They wouldn't make you like let's say a popular page like the the op-ed page in New York Times
[33:16.540 --> 33:21.740]  They weren't going to seal that with some kind of tape so that you have to sit there and spend 30 seconds
[33:22.140 --> 33:27.180]  Looking at the whatever logo is on the tape while you carefully cut across it to do it
[33:28.300 --> 33:30.780]  But they've treated online ads like that all along
[33:32.060 --> 33:34.060]  Give it time
[33:34.060 --> 33:38.380]  I really do but here's the thing I'm I'm gonna go back and now I'm gonna tell you it
[33:38.380 --> 33:40.380]  I feel like I have to explain
[33:40.380 --> 33:47.740]  why I thought you shouldn't have taken peace out of the store and at the time I didn't realize that having read your piece
[33:48.540 --> 33:53.420]  Your your your article explaining it. I would have said. Okay. You're right. If that's what you feel then just get out
[33:53.420 --> 33:58.700]  I didn't know when you called me. I didn't know what you were thinking the problem was. I think the idea of
[34:00.860 --> 34:03.980]  That once it was out and once you saw that this was
[34:04.540 --> 34:05.900]  You know that there was
[34:05.900 --> 34:12.300]  Controversy to be had and arguments to be made and that it was going to be a non-stop never never ending slog of
[34:13.420 --> 34:15.180]  What deserves to be blocked and what doesn't?
[34:15.740 --> 34:19.340]  The realization that he didn't want to be in this business was you know
[34:20.220 --> 34:22.380]  I think it was the right call. I didn't know that that's what you were thinking
[34:23.020 --> 34:28.780]  I also think that this is why you're still getting shit from people out in the internet is the because I see I've
[34:28.780 --> 34:32.620]  Have seen this where there are people who you know are like low-welling at
[34:32.620 --> 34:39.660]  How could you build a content blocker all summer long and not imagine what it was like to have a content blocker?
[34:39.660 --> 34:41.660]  I can imagine that very easily
[34:42.060 --> 34:46.940]  That you didn't really think about it. I thought your explanation. Here's a cool API
[34:46.940 --> 34:50.780]  I'd like to build one myself. I like to build things so I'll build a thing
[34:51.340 --> 34:53.340]  And you don't think pass that
[34:53.340 --> 34:55.580]  Exactly that was that was really it. It's like you know
[34:55.580 --> 34:58.780]  I explained all about it on ATP. It's like all summer long
[34:58.780 --> 35:04.300]  I was focused on how to make a really cool app using this stuff and I I was not focusing on
[35:04.940 --> 35:07.820]  What will it actually be like if I make this cool app?
[35:08.300 --> 35:14.860]  Succeed and become a major person influential in this business and having everyone look at me this way
[35:15.100 --> 35:17.500]  And I didn't think about that. You know, I should have
[35:18.300 --> 35:22.620]  But I was naive and I I wanted to do the cool
[35:23.180 --> 35:26.060]  Thing where I make the cool app and then you know, I didn't you know
[35:26.060 --> 35:30.540]  It didn't really matter what the app did. I just I want I had this cool app idea
[35:30.540 --> 35:35.180]  And I I tried it and it worked really well and so I I was motivated to keep going with it
[35:35.180 --> 35:42.460]  And I just didn't think about you know, what would happen and you know, I mean a lot about this is a lot of the a lot of the
[35:42.860 --> 35:47.660]  Frustration and anger that I've received over it from other people is really about like, you know
[35:48.540 --> 35:50.540]  They they just can't believe
[35:50.540 --> 35:55.740]  That is that I got to that position and that I then gave it up for very free
[35:55.740 --> 36:00.140]  So that's that's one of the reasons, you know, one of the other reasons is like how do you walk away from all that money?
[36:00.140 --> 36:03.580]  And it's you know, it's like well, you know, money is and everything and I felt bad about it, etc
[36:04.140 --> 36:05.820]  and
[36:06.540 --> 36:08.780]  I mean just once I decided to
[36:09.900 --> 36:11.900]  To take it off the store
[36:12.540 --> 36:17.180]  And I just when I had it once I decided that like you said you were the dentist it was
[36:17.180 --> 36:21.020]  The the moment I decided oh, I should get saw the store
[36:21.740 --> 36:24.540]  It was like 10 30 in the morning. It was down by 1230
[36:25.180 --> 36:29.420]  It was it was like two hours like all I had to do was I I talked to over with my wife
[36:29.980 --> 36:35.180]  I ran up by you and I ran up by the ghost room people to make sure that I even could do without breaking the contract and
[36:35.660 --> 36:39.660]  And that ended that they weren't gonna be you know, hardly mad about it and that was it
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.660]  And I was like, you know what yeah, I want to do this
[36:41.660 --> 36:43.740]  I'm done like as soon as I even had the idea to do it
[36:43.740 --> 36:48.700]  I felt a million times better like I it was like this giant weight off my shoulders and
[36:49.980 --> 36:55.100]  That night when I was working on overcast again for the first time in a couple of weeks. It felt so good because
[36:55.900 --> 36:57.340]  Overcast
[36:57.340 --> 37:01.180]  Will probably not make in its entire next year
[37:01.980 --> 37:03.980]  What piece could make in two or three days
[37:04.780 --> 37:09.180]  But it's funny because so much better about it, you know
[37:09.180 --> 37:13.580]  And it you and I have talked about this that one of the things some people have a very hard time believing
[37:14.300 --> 37:16.300]  Is that anybody
[37:17.420 --> 37:23.420]  Obviously, I don't think everybody thinks this way. I don't think I'm majority, but there are clearly some people who cannot get it through their heads that
[37:25.020 --> 37:30.460]  Pure money is not a primary motivating factor for us
[37:31.500 --> 37:33.740]  It's great. I am successful right now
[37:33.740 --> 37:39.660]  And I do appreciate that and it's important to me because I have a family and so it is certainly a
[37:39.980 --> 37:47.180]  Significant motivator and it is a very high priority for me, but it's not number one and maximizing it getting every single dollar that I can
[37:47.820 --> 37:52.060]  Absolutely positively is not it's the number one motivator for me is is
[37:53.100 --> 38:00.740]  Do you know professionally is doing good work that I'm proud of and number two is probably like just what I feel like is the overall quality of my life
[38:00.740 --> 38:02.260]  am I happy?
[38:02.260 --> 38:06.900]  Money obviously plays a factor in that, but you know making the most money possible definitely doesn't
[38:07.620 --> 38:13.780]  Right, and you know you and I are both fortunate that you and I have made enough money and and make make enough money through
[38:13.780 --> 38:19.700]  Other means that like we can say no to things that don't feel right to us and and you know
[38:19.700 --> 38:25.380]  There's there's all these studies done like you know every there's a threshold for everybody and and it's surprisingly low
[38:25.940 --> 38:31.060]  Where additional money that you make above that threshold doesn't really make you happier
[38:31.060 --> 38:34.420]  You know, so there is this concept of like what is enough and
[38:35.140 --> 38:39.220]  In most cultures that aren't Americans that numbers way lower
[38:39.220 --> 38:46.860]  But even Americans have you know this concept of what is enough beyond which it stops really adding to your happiness in
[38:47.420 --> 38:52.740]  Proportional way and I've heard estimates of that number being as low as like seventy five thousand dollars a year
[38:53.220 --> 38:57.620]  Which you know for in the software business is is a pretty mid-range to low salary?
[38:57.620 --> 39:00.900]  So like it's pretty for people who were like listening to the show
[39:00.900 --> 39:03.580]  It's not that hard to achieve that. You know, it's it isn't that unheard of
[39:03.980 --> 39:09.780]  So the idea that that you that you know if you already make a six-figure salary and
[39:10.500 --> 39:15.660]  You know the idea that you could turn away money from something that you that makes you feel terrible
[39:17.060 --> 39:20.260]  that actually there's a lot of like wide spread
[39:21.100 --> 39:25.500]  You know surveys and psychology ends up to back that up where yeah
[39:25.500 --> 39:32.060]  That actually is plausible to do and in fact people do it frequently like that, you know once once you once you've reached a certain level of income
[39:32.900 --> 39:37.980]  You don't just you don't have to say yes to everything and in fact if you and a lot of people
[39:38.300 --> 39:42.740]  Choose poorly on that scale and say yes to everything and are miserable for it
[39:42.740 --> 39:45.820]  And they don't necessarily realize that like, you know, they don't have to do that
[39:46.180 --> 39:48.700]  Yeah, and there's a lot of people who you know
[39:48.700 --> 39:53.460]  You know people who do it not just because they're well off enough and they can keep their life
[39:53.460 --> 39:57.060]  So people who downgrade their lifestyle and are delighted by it
[39:57.060 --> 40:01.060]  You know somebody who is just killing themselves in a corporate attorney job
[40:01.140 --> 40:03.980]  You know hundred some hours a week doing this
[40:04.820 --> 40:10.820]  My numbing work and then they leave and become you know a teacher or something
[40:10.820 --> 40:15.460]  Yeah, or like you know you take a job with that has a much shorter commute that's way closer to your house
[40:15.620 --> 40:18.260]  Even if it pays less than the job. That's all the way in the city
[40:18.260 --> 40:24.420]  You're way happier taking the job. That's a shorter commute and you're and it's you're able to rationally say yes
[40:24.420 --> 40:30.580]  I can turn down the extra money for the job in the city because I will be way happier and probably healthier and probably have a better
[40:30.580 --> 40:36.340]  Family life if I if I choose this one, right? It's the same kind of thing at all plays it. There are somebody who leaves a
[40:37.940 --> 40:42.660]  Six-figure engineering job at Apple or any of the you know big companies out there
[40:42.980 --> 40:45.380]  And it just opens up their own coffee shop
[40:45.380 --> 40:48.260]  Which is an in tour, you know opening up a restaurant notoriously
[40:49.300 --> 40:51.300]  low margin difficult
[40:51.300 --> 40:56.340]  Business to be in but that all they've ever wanted to do is roast their own coffee and make a cool place
[40:56.340 --> 40:58.340]  You know where people can hang out
[40:58.340 --> 41:01.460]  You know, and I thought it would be tough if that's what you want to do
[41:01.460 --> 41:05.060]  I mean there could be so much happier and you're making way less money way less
[41:05.220 --> 41:10.260]  But anyway, that's it's people don't think I'll give you a concrete example of money that I have passed up
[41:10.820 --> 41:12.420]  And it's I don't think it's a thing
[41:12.420 --> 41:16.340]  It certainly wasn't sustainable. I think Google's search algorithms have gotten around it
[41:16.340 --> 41:24.260]  But at some point in the late last decade. I would I'm gonna guess that it peaked somewhere around 2008 to 2010 or so
[41:26.100 --> 41:28.340]  It was a non-stop barrage
[41:29.300 --> 41:35.220]  Every week where I got offers from people to place text ads on daring fireball
[41:35.940 --> 41:40.100]  Yeah, the big text ad thing. Yep, either they wanted them on the homepage or it would you know
[41:40.100 --> 41:45.460]  It would be some specific page that ranked highly for a certain keyword a post that I had written and
[41:46.420 --> 41:48.740]  They would offer thousands of dollars
[41:48.740 --> 41:50.900]  I mean, I remember one time it was it was a guy
[41:50.900 --> 41:53.300]  And I actually pursued it not because I thought I would take it
[41:53.300 --> 41:57.780]  But I honestly it was like something like $20,000 for I don't know a couple of months
[41:59.380 --> 42:01.140]  And it just seemed like such a large amount of money
[42:01.140 --> 42:03.540]  But the I just wanted to see is this a scam
[42:03.540 --> 42:06.820]  This is a scam, but then I thought how can it be a scam because if I don't get the money
[42:06.820 --> 42:10.020]  I'm gonna take the text ad down and it's you know, it's the the
[42:10.980 --> 42:14.340]  And I thought well, maybe the scam is that they think that Google and index it once
[42:15.300 --> 42:18.660]  I was like no it can't be because this is an article like let's say a year old article
[42:19.140 --> 42:22.900]  If they think that there's value to be gained by putting a text ad there now
[42:22.980 --> 42:26.260]  They must know that Google re indexes these pages
[42:26.820 --> 42:32.260]  And so therefore they must know that if I take the text ad down that it'll re-index and they won't have that
[42:32.260 --> 42:36.180]  Google juice, you know, and I just researched the company and it really seemed like yes
[42:36.180 --> 42:41.380]  This is a company that pays publishers tens of thousands of dollars to place these text ads
[42:41.620 --> 42:44.820]  And then you could do things they didn't even care all they cared about was the search engines
[42:44.820 --> 42:48.740]  And you you could do things like you CSS to make it display none
[42:49.300 --> 42:54.500]  Or or fix position at 4,000 pixels off screen whatever you wanted they didn't care
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.940]  So it wasn't like anybody would know it wasn't like anybody would see it
[42:57.940 --> 43:04.580]  But it was thousands of dollars from just non-stop for years and I'd say no to all of them
[43:05.060 --> 43:10.740]  Or or the other thing I would do is I would write back and they would be like what they would they a lot of them would say
[43:10.820 --> 43:14.740]  What is what would you want? How much would you want for me to put a text ad
[43:16.500 --> 43:18.500]  On a page and I would write back
[43:19.220 --> 43:22.340]  You know a hundred thousand dollars and then they would say that's too much
[43:22.340 --> 43:26.900]  I you know you're I you know because they're looking at like Alexa numbers or something they gauge my traffic
[43:26.900 --> 43:30.340]  Um, but before I got to like ridiculous numbers like that
[43:30.340 --> 43:31.300]  I would offer you know
[43:31.300 --> 43:35.620]  I remember I would write back as a joke and just say like $10,000 and they'd be like
[43:35.620 --> 43:38.340]  Well, how about seven? I'd be like oh shit
[43:39.700 --> 43:43.780]  Yeah, it's like you thought you were throwing out this obscene number that they would laugh at right
[43:43.780 --> 43:49.220]  And they were actually like yeah, that's pretty close actually. Yeah, we can do that. Now these these are ads that
[43:49.220 --> 43:56.500]  Uh, weren't all they wanted was the text all they wanted to do was trick Google and other search indexes
[43:57.060 --> 44:01.940]  There was a major industry for a while. I think I think it's finally probably died down as Google that smarter
[44:01.940 --> 44:06.260]  But that was a major industry and the money was truly significant
[44:06.260 --> 44:08.980]  I mean, I don't know what I could have if I had pursued it
[44:09.300 --> 44:15.620]  But easily tens of thousands a month. Yeah, I ran those like I backed one market that I work ahead like a hundred visitors a month
[44:15.620 --> 44:19.780]  I ran those from a company called text link ads. It was like text link ads with hyphens in it
[44:19.780 --> 44:23.380]  And that was the company name. I they might even still be around. I'm sure they've been bought a million times
[44:23.380 --> 44:28.340]  I don't think but I think text link ads were I think that in particular they were they weren't so scammy
[44:28.660 --> 44:32.740]  They they were always very it was very similar like you you embedded this PHP things
[44:32.740 --> 44:35.860]  I remember I even I I was still very you know PHP at the time
[44:35.860 --> 44:41.060]  But but I even modified the code to add no follow to the links and I think that eventually got me kicked out
[44:41.540 --> 44:43.700]  But because I I was aware of what they were doing
[44:43.700 --> 44:47.700]  And I was like well, you know, I'm gonna add no follow because that's the that's the right thing to do
[44:48.260 --> 44:51.940]  And they didn't have an explicit rule against it that I could find at the time I wrote that
[44:53.060 --> 44:57.540]  This wasn't doing any tracking it wasn't going to I mean literally there was just HTML
[44:57.540 --> 44:59.540]  So it wasn't even going to have a
[44:59.940 --> 45:02.900]  Any measurable effect on download size. We're talking about
[45:03.540 --> 45:06.900]  Not even kilobytes, but bytes actual just extra bytes
[45:07.300 --> 45:09.300]  Although I would if it loaded synchronously
[45:09.300 --> 45:14.780]  But it would have had to do what they wanted with Google. It would block the page load while it fetched it on your server side
[45:14.780 --> 45:20.340]  I don't even think I think they just wanted me to actually just paste here paste this little snippet of HTML
[45:20.340 --> 45:22.340]  Oh, it wasn't even dynamic
[45:22.340 --> 45:24.980]  No, it wasn't even dynamic most of the offers now
[45:24.980 --> 45:29.460]  I think that there were some services like text link ads were it was dynamic because they wanted to tell me
[45:29.460 --> 45:33.940]  But I used to feel these offers from people who just wanted to buy a month of you know
[45:34.020 --> 45:37.060]  Just put this snippet of HTML in this article
[45:37.060 --> 45:41.540]  For a month, you know, for you know, significant money
[45:41.540 --> 45:45.940]  And I didn't do it I turned it down because it just felt gross and it just and and I didn't need it
[45:45.940 --> 45:51.380]  I do have to admit because you know the the whole RSS sponsorship thing that at this point was taking off
[45:51.380 --> 45:53.300]  And it was doing well in the deck was you know
[45:53.300 --> 45:54.180]  I was already in the deck
[45:54.180 --> 45:55.220]  So I didn't need it
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.700]  I was already at the point where I could say during fireball is you know supporting my family
[45:59.700 --> 46:04.820]  I don't need to pile this on with things that I'm not proud of and so exactly I you know, so I didn't
[46:04.820 --> 46:09.940]  But there you know, there's other examples. I I've fielded offers from people, you know like
[46:10.740 --> 46:12.740]  You know other ad networks
[46:12.740 --> 46:17.780]  You know effectively I would have had a quit the deck and go to them who offered me way more than the deck
[46:18.020 --> 46:20.020]  You know has ever paid me per month
[46:20.420 --> 46:22.100]  and
[46:22.100 --> 46:25.060]  You know, I just said no to all of them because I
[46:25.860 --> 46:32.660]  Just dancing around switching ad networks and going to the highest bidder and looking and their ads obviously they were did just weren't they weren't
[46:32.660 --> 46:36.100]  Little nice static ads like the deck. They were big and ugly
[46:36.580 --> 46:38.900]  Right the standard I a b big rectangles and everything
[46:38.900 --> 46:42.740]  I mean the idea of looking like the deck has this amazing lock-in
[46:43.620 --> 46:50.580]  Because once you are accustomed to the way your own site looks with the deck and once your readers are accustomed to a your site looks with the deck
[46:51.620 --> 46:57.940]  Just imagine what your site would look like with this with the giant like skyscraper out in the sidebar like the regular like a big white
[46:57.940 --> 47:02.740]  Like they like that would look horrendous like it wouldn't look like your site at all
[47:02.740 --> 47:08.500]  It would look like it would look like you were like on some crazy Wi-Fi that was like injecting ads into every page
[47:08.500 --> 47:12.740]  You visited like it would look like a scam or malware had taken over or something
[47:12.980 --> 47:17.060]  It would you wouldn't you would never say oh, that's daring fireball that's normal like and you know
[47:17.060 --> 47:19.060]  It that just goes to show I think like the different
[47:19.620 --> 47:23.380]  Worlds that that are possible here in the advertising space like you have
[47:23.940 --> 47:27.220]  You know if fully native stuff like yours has sponsorships that are now everyone's doing
[47:27.220 --> 47:32.180]  Then the podcast do then you have like the the very very subtle
[47:32.740 --> 47:35.700]  Model like what the deck does and then you have everything else
[47:36.580 --> 47:38.580]  mostly like these
[47:38.820 --> 47:40.820]  giant horrible things and
[47:41.460 --> 47:43.460]  I do think
[47:43.460 --> 47:47.380]  But I can say I can say for certainly that it wasn't like the other ones that would come to me
[47:47.380 --> 47:52.100]  We're offering me well it would be 25% more than the deck or 30 it wasn't like a percentage more
[47:52.100 --> 47:56.820]  It was a factor of like three four five times more like five times more than what I was making from the deck
[47:56.820 --> 48:02.580]  It was significant money the way I always chalked it up and I and Amy completely supported me on this is that to me
[48:02.660 --> 48:04.660]  The money that I was leaving on the table
[48:05.220 --> 48:10.020]  By not using those ads was effectively investing in the brand of daring fireball
[48:10.820 --> 48:12.420]  Yeah, that's totally right
[48:12.420 --> 48:15.620]  I mean because your site has always had that look it's always
[48:16.180 --> 48:21.140]  Even even in the age now where you know you might want to consider a mobile layout in a bigger font someday
[48:21.140 --> 48:25.380]  maybe but you know your site has always had this look and
[48:25.380 --> 48:32.180]  That that definitely does help with definitely it definitely does contribute. It makes your site look higher class more valuable
[48:32.740 --> 48:36.420]  Certainly, it's much more pleasant to read as long as you hit the plus button a few times on the keyboard
[48:36.980 --> 48:41.460]  It is it is very it very much contributes. You know if you go to slash press
[48:41.940 --> 48:47.380]  You'll get a little prefer it. It's actually they used to be multiple press which is why I do that on my devices
[48:47.620 --> 48:50.340]  Yeah, and then set do you sync via iCloud? I doubt it. No
[48:50.340 --> 48:55.300]  It sets a cookie on your device, but anybody who doesn't know this you can go to during fireball dot net slash
[48:55.460 --> 48:59.300]  Preffs and you'll can set the font size and it'll save it in a cookie on that device
[48:59.780 --> 49:04.100]  Yeah, maybe maybe I should get to you sometime and make you finally update your font
[49:04.580 --> 49:08.020]  It'll happen it'll add a response of layout maybe well, you know what?
[49:09.140 --> 49:11.140]  All right, not to it's
[49:11.380 --> 49:15.860]  We can keep going on this. I want it. I gotta do a sponsor break, but one of the things that
[49:16.980 --> 49:18.980]  If I do if and when I do
[49:18.980 --> 49:27.220]  I want to change it once. I want to change the layout to during fireball. I once and then have it last at least another 15 to 20 years
[49:28.180 --> 49:33.380]  No pressure well, I the last design, you know has gone close to
[49:35.220 --> 49:42.420]  So I changed it in like 2003 or 2004 there wasn't early there's like a for the first year during fireball is a slightly different design so
[49:43.620 --> 49:45.620]  11 years
[49:45.620 --> 49:51.140]  I feel like I could get one that goes for 15 and maybe I'll need to tweak it like I have this one, you know
[49:51.220 --> 49:52.260]  Here and there
[49:52.260 --> 49:58.580]  subtly over the years, but you know I want to do it once but to do it once I think it would require web fonts and
[49:59.380 --> 50:00.820]  I've
[50:00.820 --> 50:03.220]  Procrastinating for years on web fonts because I just
[50:03.940 --> 50:09.140]  Can't get over the fact that to me. They feel a little slow and one of the things that I really love about during fireball
[50:09.140 --> 50:13.780]  That's how fast it's one of my favorite things I get from people from email or tweets or something like that is every once in a while
[50:13.780 --> 50:17.860]  Like if during fireball does go down or if there's like a
[50:21.780 --> 50:26.740]  DNS outage on the net which makes really weird things and it's like some people
[50:26.740 --> 50:30.420]  You know like people say hey is during fireball down and I check and it's definitely not down
[50:30.420 --> 50:31.620]  It's right there really fast
[50:32.180 --> 50:39.860]  But I keep I get like three or four of these it's usually like a DNS problem and people who are somewhere on some chunk of the internet can't get there
[50:39.860 --> 50:45.860]  And when people say the following to me, it always makes my day. They say during fireball isn't just one of my favorite sites
[50:45.860 --> 50:49.060]  It's also the thing I always go to when I want to check my internet connection
[50:50.100 --> 50:54.420]  That's great. Yeah, but they expect that it's always up and they expect it to load
[50:54.820 --> 50:56.260]  against and
[50:56.260 --> 50:58.980]  And web fonts definitely change that so I've
[50:59.460 --> 51:04.740]  Put off on that, you know, and and that's funny because with the content bloggers a lot of them have an option to block web fonts
[51:04.740 --> 51:13.140]  Specifically just just to make things faster not because anybody's really opposed to nobody's opposed to good-looking font and nobody's opposed to
[51:14.180 --> 51:16.660]  Nice design, but people some people favor
[51:17.780 --> 51:19.780]  fast page loads over
[51:20.580 --> 51:26.980]  You know pristine designer however work you want to put it. Yeah, I mean I was I was doing that in from the early builds of peace
[51:26.980 --> 51:31.460]  That was like one of the very first things I built was I built one that blocked all third-party JavaScript
[51:31.460 --> 51:39.420]  which was insane but worked and and I and it had an option to block all web fonts and it broke my site broke a lot of other sites
[51:39.420 --> 51:40.780]  but
[51:40.780 --> 51:42.780]  It was so much faster
[51:42.780 --> 51:47.860]  Like it it was a massive speed difference and so now like as much as I love the this wonderful
[51:47.860 --> 51:54.820]  League of J ideal sands font that I use on my site and and you know as far as I know like I've seen a couple of benchmarks here
[51:54.820 --> 51:58.660]  And there that suggests that the Hfj web fonts are not as fast as type kit
[51:58.660 --> 52:03.060]  But either way neither none of them are what I would call fast enough
[52:03.220 --> 52:09.300]  You know like there you're still loading a few hundred kilobytes of of fonts for most people that
[52:09.540 --> 52:13.060]  You know, and it's from some other CDN that is off off hosts
[52:13.060 --> 52:18.300]  So it's like making another connection and everything and pop another opportunity for weird latency or DNS issues and
[52:19.780 --> 52:24.860]  You know the fact is web fonts are really nice. They're they're very much like a nice to have
[52:24.860 --> 52:31.740]  But if they're gonna come at a big cost, they're probably not worth it for most sites and what I found when I would like
[52:31.740 --> 52:36.220]  When I would when I would when I've been browsing with with web fonts disabled on my phone for for a while now
[52:36.700 --> 52:42.180]  And even with ghostery on the desktop. I would I would turn off type kit because that's one of their trackers that they they can block
[52:42.500 --> 52:44.860]  I've been doing that for a couple months too and
[52:45.900 --> 52:51.900]  You really don't miss much like it's you know you can tell on certain sites where like they didn't have a good fallback
[52:51.900 --> 52:56.540]  actually defaults to like times new Roman you can you know you can tell like oh this wasn't supposed to look like times
[52:56.940 --> 52:57.820]  but
[52:57.820 --> 52:59.820]  for the most part
[52:59.820 --> 53:06.860]  Things load really fast and nothing looks that bad and many times it looks pretty good because if it falls back to something sensible
[53:07.180 --> 53:08.220]  so
[53:08.220 --> 53:12.540]  You know, I would say if if I redesigned my site anytime soon
[53:13.260 --> 53:20.380]  I would almost certainly go back to a regular system font and not use any more web fonts just for speed because it just isn't worth it
[53:20.380 --> 53:24.140]  And that being said in defense of your ancient site design
[53:24.780 --> 53:26.620]  I will say that that a couple months ago
[53:27.180 --> 53:32.220]  I decided to to be a smart ass and to try to try to like just
[53:32.620 --> 53:33.500]  write
[53:33.500 --> 53:34.380]  like
[53:34.380 --> 53:40.620]  Ten lines of CSS or whatever that I could just like text you and have you injected in your template?
[53:40.620 --> 53:45.660]  I'm like here's your here's your frickin responsive layout here like here just modernize your site with this little thing
[53:45.660 --> 53:46.700]  I just wrote in an hour
[53:46.940 --> 53:49.340]  So that was my plan. I was gonna do this and I tried it
[53:49.340 --> 53:57.660]  I started and your site is surprisingly complex like I tried doing that and realized it was going to be way more work
[53:58.220 --> 54:01.020]  Than then what I had planned for this is a common theme with me
[54:01.740 --> 54:05.340]  It's gonna be way more work and I was like yeah, okay
[54:05.340 --> 54:08.380]  Now I understand why you haven't done this yet. Yeah, that's a pretty bad
[54:08.860 --> 54:11.980]  Well, I mean, it's been so long that I don't really have an excuse, but well
[54:11.980 --> 54:17.340]  I you've probably started it like ten times. Yeah, it's a lot of boring backstories there, but
[54:17.340 --> 54:22.780]  It'll happen sooner or later, but yeah, there's no way to just take the current HTML and easily
[54:23.580 --> 54:27.580]  Do it. I mean you can make a new one that looks that that on the widescreen looks the same
[54:27.580 --> 54:30.780]  But the the way that everything is structured right now is actually sort of
[54:32.300 --> 54:33.420]  Fights against
[54:33.420 --> 54:35.420]  Responsibly out
[54:35.820 --> 54:42.380]  It'll happen well the other thing. Probably the worst thing that ever happened was the fact that with a very lit a very short amount of
[54:42.380 --> 54:50.460]  I think it's just like that one viewport meta tag and the fact that a double tap on the main text column
[54:50.940 --> 54:55.500]  Is pretty good and it has been since the original iPhone in 2007
[54:55.500 --> 55:01.580]  I mean like two lines of code in 2007 made it easy to just double tap on the center column of text and have it
[55:01.580 --> 55:04.060]  Reason of you know pretty good size and a pretty good width
[55:04.060 --> 55:09.420]  It's not nice and fixed so that you can use you can still slide around sideways when you scroll, but
[55:09.420 --> 55:12.460]  It's actually pretty good for a
[55:12.700 --> 55:13.660]  you know
[55:13.660 --> 55:19.700]  For a non mobile optimized layout and that's probably the worst thing that ever happened because if it had been terrible on
[55:19.700 --> 55:23.260]  iPhone, I would have done something in 2007 or 2008
[55:24.220 --> 55:28.780]  Yeah, I mean and that's I mean your site works the way every site works in 2007
[55:28.780 --> 55:34.940]  You know, and it's this was the problem that I created insta paper to solve like it one of the problems is like I didn't want to keep
[55:34.940 --> 55:38.140]  Zooming in on everyone's pages and then like I would scroll scroll scrolls
[55:38.140 --> 55:43.580]  I was reading and I'd actually get misaligned a little bit side-to-side and then I let me try to realign back to the center
[55:43.580 --> 55:45.900]  Calm and ever quite get it right to have to zoom back out and zoom back in
[55:46.540 --> 55:48.540]  because I'm you know just pretend to play that
[55:49.180 --> 55:50.540]  and
[55:51.340 --> 55:53.340]  I talked to a couple of people
[55:53.980 --> 55:59.260]  About a year ago with this like I think if I was designing insta paper from scratch today
[55:59.420 --> 56:02.860]  Like if I was designing a thing that would solve this problem from scratch today
[56:03.580 --> 56:05.820]  I don't think I would do the text view
[56:05.820 --> 56:09.580]  I think I would just save what was there on the page like the full layout because
[56:09.900 --> 56:12.620]  responsive design and and modern
[56:13.740 --> 56:15.740]  Sensible design on most of the sites that I want to read
[56:16.380 --> 56:20.540]  And especially now with content blockers existing if there was way to hook into that kind of system
[56:21.340 --> 56:30.380]  Responsive design really solved the problem pretty well most of the time like these like back in 2007 2008 when I was designing insta paper at first
[56:30.380 --> 56:37.180]  The text view was necessary because no sites had mobile layouts responsive design didn't even exist yet
[56:37.740 --> 56:43.100]  Like the spec wasn't even there like the media queries. I don't think you even existed back then or at least we're not widely supported
[56:43.580 --> 56:46.140]  So like you couldn't do responsive design back then
[56:46.780 --> 56:50.700]  But that had really removed a lot of the need for things like
[56:51.660 --> 56:55.660]  Insta-apers techs view and safaris reader view. Yeah prior to the iPhone
[56:55.660 --> 57:01.820]  The only thing that had ever been done in web standards for mobile were completely different sites whap
[57:01.820 --> 57:03.420]  I guess was the big one
[57:03.420 --> 57:09.660]  You know wap I don't even know what it stood for but that it was so that the devices pre-iPhone were so
[57:10.220 --> 57:15.220]  Primitive computationally and displays were so small that it wasn't even feasible
[57:15.220 --> 57:21.740]  Nobody had even really considered. How would we make a dynamic layout that this you could just have one URL one web page
[57:21.740 --> 57:28.380]  And it would look this way on a big monitor this way on a smaller monitor and this way on it on a tiny little phone
[57:29.260 --> 57:30.780]  Nobody'd even thought about that
[57:30.780 --> 57:35.820]  All right, that's why you still have sites today that have like mobile dot blah blah you or else that don't redirect
[57:35.980 --> 57:40.540]  Well, and yeah, that's a little different because they usually don't go to like a whap type site
[57:40.540 --> 57:45.940]  But still there and still annoying but anyway, let me take a break here. I got to thank our first sponsor. This is a good one
[57:45.940 --> 57:50.980]  Um, so so don't skip ahead. This is gonna be a good a good read
[57:51.620 --> 57:53.940]  Um, it's the brawer group
[57:54.580 --> 57:58.900]  B-r-a-w-e-r now. They sponsored during fireball before. I think they actually
[57:59.460 --> 58:01.460]  Actually sponsored the talk show too
[58:01.460 --> 58:03.060]  Um, and it was a great success
[58:03.380 --> 58:08.260]  So they're back to announce these are the guys behind an app called is a mac app called ubar
[58:08.820 --> 58:10.820]  Just like a lowercase u
[58:10.820 --> 58:18.740]  B-a-r you bar three and it implements a ton of suggestions from he even says specifically from listeners at the talk
[58:18.740 --> 58:26.020]  Show and breeders the daring fireball. It's a doc replacement for the mac the purpose of ubar is to vastly increase your productivity
[58:26.180 --> 58:28.180]  Pro users love it, but it's also
[58:28.260 --> 58:31.300]  Uh, you know, it's not just like a pro only tool you can definitely
[58:32.020 --> 58:35.060]  You know see how a normal person in your family would totally get into this
[58:35.540 --> 58:37.700]  um, and it is sort of
[58:37.700 --> 58:41.620]  Sort of modeled more on the windows taskbar
[58:41.940 --> 58:48.580]  So if you are anybody in your family has switched from windows and sort of doesn't like the ways that the Mac OS 10 doc
[58:49.140 --> 58:54.180]  Uh, isn't like the windows taskbar you bar is exactly the sort of thing you should look at
[58:54.660 --> 58:59.700]  Um, it looks good. It's not ugly. It's very very cool looking very beautiful. It's pure OS 10
[59:00.180 --> 59:06.260]  Um, style design and it's got for power users tons of shortcuts you can do things like hold down control
[59:06.260 --> 59:12.020]  And you can see the CPU and RAM usage for any of the apps that are in there that are running hold down shift
[59:12.020 --> 59:16.180]  And you can quit any app or close any window from that app just by clicking it
[59:16.820 --> 59:18.820]  Uh apps that are unresponsive
[59:19.300 --> 59:22.820]  Get a red background so you can spot hanging apps immediately
[59:22.820 --> 59:28.980]  You don't have to go and launch so it's sort of like it's it's adding features from activity monitor right there in the in the taskbar
[59:30.100 --> 59:33.140]  Tons and tons of customer customization
[59:33.140 --> 59:37.140]  Uh, you can set the size. There's different themes dark and light
[59:38.100 --> 59:43.220]  Exactly what you would think you get the idea when you listen to the you know the idea of this type of app
[59:43.220 --> 59:45.220]  You know there's a lot of customization
[59:45.220 --> 59:49.700]  Uh, you can put on any side of any monitor including the top you can pin it to a corner
[59:50.340 --> 59:55.380]  Uh, just unbelievable stuff. So there's here's what you do go to you bar app
[59:55.860 --> 1:00:01.140]  com and they have a four-week trial you can download it start running it you get four weeks
[1:00:01.140 --> 1:00:08.500]  Um, and the cost is only 20 bucks. So this is a great utility typical Mac utility price 20 bucks
[1:00:09.460 --> 1:00:12.740]  But and I think they're actually crazy because I think 20 bucks is a great price, but
[1:00:13.700 --> 1:00:16.900]  Here's the deal. This is a my idea, but they have a code retina
[1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:17.940]  Gruber
[1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:19.220]  R E T I N A
[1:00:19.220 --> 1:00:21.220]  Then my last name retina Gruber
[1:00:21.220 --> 1:00:25.380]  I don't know if that's a reference to retina graphics or my my eye problems or both but either way
[1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:27.380]  That's going the way could go either way
[1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:28.500]  50% off
[1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:33.700]  So you can get it for just 10 bucks. So you get four weeks to try it and then it's 10 bucks to get it
[1:00:34.900 --> 1:00:37.460]  And then this is the part that's amazing one more thing
[1:00:38.340 --> 1:00:45.060]  Uh, the developer of the app his last name is brower. I'll actually forget his first name. Let me look it up real quick
[1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:48.420]  Seems like a shame. I don't know
[1:00:49.300 --> 1:00:52.580]  He has the app and saw Edward Edward brawer
[1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:57.460]  So the app and software development. That's his primary. That's how he supports himself
[1:00:57.460 --> 1:00:59.460]  That's he's a programmer
[1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:06.820]  But he has the most amazing hobby his hobby is watchmaking. He makes real mechanical watches
[1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:12.260]  So he's actually launching a new time piece right here on the show. It's called the mirage
[1:01:13.140 --> 1:01:18.740]  It is a limited edition of only 300 pieces each with an engraved number on the back
[1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:21.380]  He has sent one to me
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:25.860]  It's really really nice. I think my number is
[1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:29.220]  I forget what number I got 104 or something like that
[1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:30.900]  Um
[1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:34.340]  Really nice style beautiful typography. I mean, this is like a real
[1:01:35.460 --> 1:01:38.820]  Serious watch. I think here's the price
[1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:44.260]  750 bucks, so we're talking about this you know, this is not like a joke
[1:01:44.820 --> 1:01:52.020]  It looks like a $750 watch. It is really really amazing very very nice. It has a totally serious
[1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:55.780]  Strap. It's made by a company. I'm never gonna pronounce this right. Camille
[1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:58.420]  Fournet in Paris
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:07.380]  It's a lizard like alligator leather strap. They make OEM straps for actual serious watch companies like peteck Philippe
[1:02:08.740 --> 1:02:13.860]  And others it has a this single deployment class single fold deployment class
[1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:18.020]  That only means something if you're a watch person, but if you are a watch person, you know what it means
[1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:21.220]  It's really really nice. It is like a serious dress watch
[1:02:22.020 --> 1:02:24.580]  But you know, not so dressy that you couldn't wear it casually
[1:02:26.420 --> 1:02:29.140]  So go to for the watch go to brower
[1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.780]  B-R-A-W-E-R
[1:02:31.780 --> 1:02:32.980]  Timepieces
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:36.980]  dot com and the same code works there retna Gruber
[1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:41.620]  And you can get that watch for 40% off
[1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:46.420]  So it's $750 watch, but you can get it for 40% off using that code
[1:02:46.420 --> 1:02:49.860]  Shipping is free in the USA and Canada
[1:02:50.980 --> 1:02:53.460]  And it comes in a real watch box again
[1:02:53.460 --> 1:02:58.420]  But if you've ever bought like a fancy watch or like the even like the Apple edition watches
[1:02:58.420 --> 1:03:03.620]  You know that like you know $1,000 wish watches supposed to come in a nice box this thing comes in a really nice box
[1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:08.180]  You can't I the thing that I can't believe it's not that I can't believe that somebody made a nice watch
[1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:10.900]  There's lots of nice watches out there. I just can't believe that this guy
[1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:15.620]  Designed and made it and did all this stuff and you know
[1:03:15.620 --> 1:03:22.740]  Did all the the machining to actually machine out the stainless steel frame of the watch and everything as like his hobby
[1:03:23.540 --> 1:03:29.140]  It's absolutely crazy that this is like the second thing that the same guy does who makes this amazing Ubar app
[1:03:29.140 --> 1:03:36.100]  So my thanks to to them for the Ubar which is probably something an awful lot of you ought to go look at and maybe by and
[1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:38.900]  For the new Mirage watch
[1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:43.620]  Which probably isn't gonna sell to a lot of you, but for those of you who are into watches
[1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:47.620]  It's absolutely positively worth looking at also. It's not too big. I hate big watches
[1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:50.980]  I don't know what I would say if it was real big but it has a diameter of only 40 millimeters
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:53.300]  So it's a perfectly standard
[1:03:54.260 --> 1:03:59.540]  Not too big so watch a woman could get away with it. It'd be like a nice big watch for a woman
[1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:05.540]  Totally normal size for men comes in three colors white blue and black so my thanks to them check them out
[1:04:06.980 --> 1:04:11.620]  Is that the craziest sponsor that might be one of the craziest sponsors I've ever had that is pretty impressive
[1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:16.100]  Also, I want to give you all my French words to pronounce whenever I need that
[1:04:16.820 --> 1:04:19.700]  I have no idea if I pronounce that right. That's not even that hard
[1:04:20.340 --> 1:04:22.100]  All right on the ad here's the thing
[1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:25.060]  I want to tell you why I think you were
[1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.100]  Here's the mistake. I think you made with peace
[1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:33.060]  And I feel guilty about this because I knew over the summer that you were working on this thing and I
[1:04:33.780 --> 1:04:36.500]  Didn't test it until like the night before or something like that
[1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:41.860]  And I feel bad that I didn't because I would have I would have called you out on the fact that it wasn't
[1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:43.780]  Whitelisting the deck
[1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:49.460]  Rottomatically and in fact I was confused because I could swear that the night before when I didn't stall the beta
[1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:55.220]  I did the first thing I did was check tearing fireball and I could swear that it did show the ad and then you told me that
[1:04:55.540 --> 1:05:00.420]  There's some flakiness when you first enable these things and sometimes you have to restart and I think that's what I saw
[1:05:00.420 --> 1:05:07.380]  I don't want to put words in math, but here's what I think you were thinking you were thinking I
[1:05:09.220 --> 1:05:12.660]  I'm not I don't a I don't want to have a whole bunch of fiddly settings
[1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.860]  So I don't want to have it some of a thing that says block
[1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:21.860]  Block all ads block most ads block half ads just block the worst ads
[1:05:22.420 --> 1:05:25.220]  I'm just gonna say you know here. Here's a switch block ad
[1:05:25.220 --> 1:05:30.900]  And I think you were thinking I would be a hypocrite if I whitelisted the deck
[1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:34.260]  Just because that's what my site is in
[1:05:34.820 --> 1:05:41.140]  So I'll do the thing that's not being a hypocrite and just include the deck which is mine which is sort of
[1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:45.060]  I don't know magnanimous. I don't know what the word is
[1:05:46.580 --> 1:05:48.580]  I think that
[1:05:48.580 --> 1:05:56.900]  By not whitelisting the deck, you are committing an entirely different form of hypocrisy, which is that
[1:06:00.100 --> 1:06:02.100]  All
[1:06:02.420 --> 1:06:04.420]  everything is content
[1:06:04.420 --> 1:06:06.420]  and
[1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:15.300]  Everything that you publish from Marco.org is you're you're standing behind so by publishing ads from the deck by
[1:06:15.300 --> 1:06:20.100]  Sending them to your users. You're implicitly saying this is an ad that's worth your
[1:06:21.700 --> 1:06:28.260]  Seeing and it's worth your device that you're accessing this site downloading and rendering and putting on the page
[1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:35.140]  So I feel like you painted yourself into by by releasing peace with the deck not being included
[1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:43.620]  You have two things you've got a website that is implicitly saying this is a thing this ad is worth you seeing and is okay
[1:06:43.620 --> 1:06:48.020]  And then you have this other thing which is saying this is something that should be blocked
[1:06:49.940 --> 1:06:51.940]  And there's no way to square that circle
[1:06:52.820 --> 1:06:59.460]  Yeah, that's true. I mean that's that was part of the problem is that this was this was an unsolvable problem
[1:06:59.620 --> 1:07:06.260]  You know, it was I can I could say that I no longer want any web ads to exist and I can I could leave the deck
[1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:08.580]  I quit the deck and root them from my site
[1:07:10.420 --> 1:07:12.420]  I could
[1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:16.100]  I could try to distinguish I could try to differentiate. I could say well
[1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:19.140]  I'm gonna allow acceptable ads
[1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:24.260]  But we see the problems that causes you know when when other sites try there when other blockers try that
[1:07:24.260 --> 1:07:29.860]  We see that that's extremely messy and controversial and and I that's
[1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:32.500]  You know, I didn't want to be in that business and
[1:07:33.860 --> 1:07:37.300]  You know, or I can I can try to differentiate between well
[1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:44.980]  I'm gonna block ads, but not trackers and I said that's an ATP too like you can't really make that differentiation because
[1:07:45.860 --> 1:07:49.620]  If you want to block tracking you have to block almost all ads
[1:07:50.180 --> 1:07:51.940]  so it you know and and
[1:07:52.980 --> 1:07:54.500]  Trying to
[1:07:54.500 --> 1:08:00.100]  Try to keep up the list of what belongs on the other side of that almost is is very
[1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:08.180]  Politically charged. It is a very subjective. It's very messy and arguable and vague as to what you know
[1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:10.500]  What kind of ad is okay?
[1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:14.660]  What kind of ad is safe and is not a tracker? What is what is tracking include?
[1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:20.020]  There's it's just it's such a it's such a messy world of
[1:08:20.820 --> 1:08:25.860]  vague distinctions and impossible problems and and whatever decision you make
[1:08:25.860 --> 1:08:30.660]  People are going to disagree with it and so actually the safest
[1:08:31.380 --> 1:08:36.420]  Most defensible position that an ablocker can take is to just block everything
[1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:42.580]  Like that that is the most defensible position that I think that they most of them can take and they just have to then own
[1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:48.340]  What they actually are and this this is the part I had a problem with like you can't just say I'm gonna block trackers
[1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:50.340]  And I'm gonna serve only good
[1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:52.820]  You have to hit some people
[1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:56.980]  in in the process of being effective like some people have to lose and
[1:08:58.180 --> 1:09:00.180]  Some of them are gonna be good people
[1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:03.220]  Like the deck, you know, we know all these people and these are good people
[1:09:03.540 --> 1:09:05.540]  But if you're saying I'm selling an ad blocker
[1:09:05.860 --> 1:09:08.580]  It has to block the deck and and it's weird
[1:09:08.580 --> 1:09:18.740]  And if you if you sell an ad blocker and you know about the deck and you know the deck is ads and you whitelisted or you you explicitly
[1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:22.100]  Like go and omit it from your database once it was already there
[1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:26.420]  And you're selling people an ad blocker then you're lying to your customers
[1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:28.980]  That's why I don't think you should call it an ad blocker
[1:09:29.220 --> 1:09:34.980]  I think and I've right, but if you don't call it an ad blocker. Nobody buys it. That's the problem. You know, it's it's a terrible business
[1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:40.020]  I think that I don't know. I don't know if that no one would buy it
[1:09:40.100 --> 1:09:44.260]  I mean, what did you how did you what did the marketing materials for peace describe it as?
[1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:48.660]  It said peace block ads and trackers powered by ghostery something like that
[1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:53.540]  So block block web ads and trackers. I would have said something to the effect of
[1:09:55.220 --> 1:09:59.300]  Well, I wouldn't use the word crappy, but block crappy ads and trackers
[1:10:00.420 --> 1:10:02.420]  and think of you know put that it
[1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:05.140]  Off the top of my head. I can't think of the way I would say that but
[1:10:05.860 --> 1:10:10.580]  That would be the gist of what I would get across in very few words block crappy ads and trackers
[1:10:10.980 --> 1:10:16.420]  And then that lets you whitelist and and there are like one of the most popular ones right now
[1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:20.820]  And the one if anybody wants my recommendation right now the one I'm using is one blocker
[1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:25.620]  And by default one blocker does not block the deck
[1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:31.940]  I've actually exchanged some emails with Ben Brooks who's doing a lot of work at at Brooks report led
[1:10:32.420 --> 1:10:35.460]  Really serious yeoman's work especially if he's you know
[1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:40.340]  He's like restarting his iPhone in between testing these things just to sort of get it to his neutral estate and
[1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:45.380]  Clearing us because as you said like the system is buggy and it's it's really hard to know
[1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:47.700]  For sure whether something's enabled or not and sometimes
[1:10:48.020 --> 1:10:53.460]  The system won't like I had to I had to make a test URL that like on pieces website
[1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:58.180]  I test URL that would load and would try to redirect to something that piece blocked
[1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:03.060]  And then would detect whether the reader at succeed or not and note of and so like I had this button in the app
[1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:07.700]  It would just test installation and it would like slide up a web view for a second and test something and slide it back down
[1:11:07.700 --> 1:11:09.700]  And have and tell you what happened
[1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:15.140]  Um, but it's very buggy. It's a very buggy system what I'm looking for in
[1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:21.860]  Uh an ad blocker or a content blocker whatever you want to call it for iOS is I want one that is fast and
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:26.820]  Notice it'll be improves the browsing experience. Uh, you know on my iPhone
[1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:36.900]  Uh blocks as much like pernicious stuff like the type of ads that like cover up pop up and full page
[1:11:36.900 --> 1:11:40.020]  You know block that the page I'm looking at um
[1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:42.740]  block stuff like that
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:45.620]  uh doesn't block the deck by default and
[1:11:47.220 --> 1:11:49.220]  That's it and
[1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:54.820]  The problem is that nobody agrees on where that line is I agree I agree and that's you know
[1:11:54.820 --> 1:11:59.620]  Obviously, that's gotta so one of the other ways to look at it is no no ad blocker is going to be perfect
[1:11:59.780 --> 1:12:05.780]  Absolutely not and and and and even if it you could say right now this moment as I submit to the app store
[1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:10.420]  I think it's as close to perfect as I can get it in terms of what it blocks and what it doesn't by next week
[1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:12.420]  That's going to be different
[1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:18.100]  Because some of the people you block are going to find workarounds and some of the ones you don't might clean up their policies
[1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:20.100]  It's it's totally dynamic but
[1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:25.540]  I what I would what I would suggest and what I really think is possible and what I think for example
[1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:31.700]  One blocker right now is evidence of is that what you have to do is pick which side of perfection
[1:12:31.700 --> 1:12:38.660]  You're going to be on are you going to be as your blocker going to be on the side of letting through some stuff that probably should be blocked
[1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:40.900]  Or is it going to be on the side of
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:46.260]  airing on the side of blocking some stuff that shouldn't be blocked and I think it's possible
[1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:51.540]  I think it's possible to build an ad blocker or a content blocker whatever you want to call it that
[1:12:54.020 --> 1:13:00.020]  Isn't over aggressive and so therefore errors on the side of maybe there will be some things that get through that that you wish
[1:13:00.020 --> 1:13:04.740]  Didn't get through but that overall gives you a really fast browsing experience and blocks most of the stuff
[1:13:04.740 --> 1:13:11.060]  You want and doesn't punish people who are doing it the right way and are serving things that shouldn't be blocked
[1:13:11.700 --> 1:13:13.220]  I
[1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:18.500]  Think that's possible and one blocker is is the best proof of it today that it could be done
[1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:25.780]  But the fact is that what's amazing to me is that in Ben Brooks testing and he's I think he's up to like 32 of these
[1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:28.020]  I was content blockers that he's
[1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:32.820]  Tract in his testing one blocker isn't just fast. It's the fastest
[1:13:32.820 --> 1:13:36.420]  I don't know where peace was on that because he he's taking peace out of that but
[1:13:37.140 --> 1:13:42.660]  The only one that's faster. It was it was roughly in the middle when he still had it in the only one that's faster is some
[1:13:42.980 --> 1:13:48.100]  Crazy one that I think is sort of like the one you wrote this summer that just blocks all third party JavaScript
[1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:52.420]  There's one that makes that that is head and shoulders faster than anything
[1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:57.380]  But it breaks half the internet like Ben Brooks. I he I forget the name of it
[1:13:57.380 --> 1:13:59.380]  It's got like a funny name too, but it
[1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:04.420]  There's a whole bunch of like mainstream sites that just render as a white white box
[1:14:05.460 --> 1:14:12.020]  No, I actually I had that issue with with my first because I went my my first version of peace
[1:14:12.340 --> 1:14:14.340]  Before and you go share the deal with ghostery
[1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:19.620]  It literally just blocked all third party JavaScript and the the funny thing is how well that works most of the time
[1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:22.180]  It's called it's called script scrap
[1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:25.300]  That's a wonderfully awkward name
[1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:30.980]  No, I mean like it that approach actually works the vast majority of the time
[1:14:31.220 --> 1:14:34.580]  But you know it's it's one of those things where like if the error rate
[1:14:34.820 --> 1:14:38.020]  Like if the pages it breaks if it breaks on 10% of pages
[1:14:38.020 --> 1:14:42.500]  Well, that's actually very annoying in practice like that's that's too high of a breakage rate
[1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:46.420]  And the reason I went with ghostery instead was because
[1:14:46.420 --> 1:14:52.020]  It was the solution. I found that had that that had the lowest rate of sites that broke
[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:54.500]  Like things that actually just stopped working
[1:14:55.300 --> 1:14:57.460]  Because like a lot of sites will tie in in weird ways
[1:14:58.100 --> 1:15:01.620]  To like especially analytics packages and especially Adobe Omniture
[1:15:02.180 --> 1:15:07.860]  That is one like Apple site breaks without that a bunch of sites like the like functionality actually stops
[1:15:08.340 --> 1:15:10.740]  If you don't have certain trackers and able to go story
[1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:15.140]  actually keeps a database of that and and build it into their to their extension
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:17.140]  To to try to like whitelist
[1:15:18.100 --> 1:15:22.420]  Like to to try to whitelist things like that that are fairly innocent
[1:15:23.140 --> 1:15:26.740]  On certain sites that are required for them to work properly
[1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:30.100]  Yeah, and they maintain a list of sites that break with you know
[1:15:30.100 --> 1:15:36.100]  For example, Omniture disabled and that's automatically whitelist to by default. I forget what it was that I couldn't
[1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:41.300]  There's a part of Apple's developer website that I couldn't get working. I was like what the hell's going on
[1:15:41.300 --> 1:15:46.420]  Yeah, and it just occurred to me it was like oh maybe I should whitelist this in ghostry
[1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:49.140]  And I did and it worked. I was like oh man of all the sites
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:52.820]  I never thought that I would have to dick around in ghostry. It was apple.com
[1:15:52.820 --> 1:15:56.820]  It literally has no ads and let you know unless you consider the entire website and add
[1:15:58.580 --> 1:16:02.340]  You know as no ads that you would think of as web ads, but it actually breaks without it
[1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:04.420]  And it was I think it was exactly that Adobe
[1:16:05.220 --> 1:16:09.780]  Omniture whatever the hell that is well, and that's I don't even know I think it's kind of analytics thing
[1:16:09.780 --> 1:16:13.700]  But you know one of the one of the problems one of the reasons why we have
[1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:21.620]  Such obscenely rampant and over the top tracking on the web is this this culture of data people where like every thing
[1:16:21.860 --> 1:16:23.220]  it is considered
[1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:25.380]  outrageous and obscene and
[1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:31.700]  Reckless if you run a website today that doesn't do very detailed analytics and behavioral tracking
[1:16:32.100 --> 1:16:35.460]  Like if you if you have access to quote data
[1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:40.180]  And you're not collecting it and you're not mining it and analyzing it for eyeballs and
[1:16:40.660 --> 1:16:46.500]  Rare to their body parts like it is like that you're considered like negligent almost in an owner of a website
[1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:55.940]  Not doing all this tracking like that the standard industry wisdom and the pressure from everywhere in the industry is to track as much as you possibly can and
[1:16:56.340 --> 1:16:58.180]  And this is and we can get into it here if you want
[1:16:59.780 --> 1:17:03.460]  One of the issues with this that that is still mostly under the radar
[1:17:03.460 --> 1:17:08.660]  is tracking happening inside of apps that can't be blocked by safari content blockers
[1:17:09.460 --> 1:17:10.660]  Yeah
[1:17:10.660 --> 1:17:17.060]  No, definitely like Twitter is famous for like always pushing the boundaries of like like they they had this database of
[1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:19.860]  Like something like over a thousand
[1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:23.700]  URL schemes custom iOS app URL schemes that they that they would call
[1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:31.300]  Can open URL on the system API and that would tell them which of these URL schemes were registered and they could then derive
[1:17:31.300 --> 1:17:37.300]  Which apps does each user have installed and they can tailor their ads and they could sell there?
[1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:43.060]  I think it's they could actually sell people the idea of we can show your Twitter ad to people who have this particular app installed
[1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:48.820]  Okay, it's crazy and then and that you know that was so egregious of a privacy violation that Apple
[1:17:49.300 --> 1:17:54.660]  Severely restricted that in iOS 9 and like they actually kind of broke it for for uses like that
[1:17:55.460 --> 1:17:59.620]  So in other words just to explain that yeah, I know exactly we're talking about
[1:17:59.620 --> 1:18:02.180]  But just for anybody who who if that went over your head
[1:18:02.820 --> 1:18:05.060]  So the way sandboxing works
[1:18:05.700 --> 1:18:09.700]  On iOS an app that plays by the rules and uses you know the
[1:18:10.340 --> 1:18:16.980]  Passes the test that they do that you're not using private API's can't really look outside at sandbox and look at the file system and see
[1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:19.540]  What's in your
[1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:22.340]  iPhones slash applications folder
[1:18:23.380 --> 1:18:24.980]  You can't do it
[1:18:25.220 --> 1:18:28.020]  But what Twitter did and I'm sure other people did but Twitter
[1:18:28.020 --> 1:18:31.300]  I guess really won't went far is when a customer got caught
[1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:35.780]  When a custom app like if insta paper has an insta paper colon slash slash
[1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:43.540]  URL scheme and then you know the idea of the URL scheme is hey that way another app can integrate with insta paper
[1:18:44.180 --> 1:18:48.340]  And this was really common in the pre sharing sheet days where you know
[1:18:48.340 --> 1:18:51.860]  Apps would the only really way that apps could communicate with each with each other
[1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:57.380]  Want you know insta paper communicating with tweetbot or something like that was through a URL scheme
[1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:59.860]  So if tweetbot was going to
[1:19:01.700 --> 1:19:06.020]  Integrate with insta paper it used it URL scheme did it on mid you you know
[1:19:06.420 --> 1:19:12.340]  Is that how tweetbot used to integrate with insta paper as far as I remember? Yeah, I mean almost all the all the Twitter clients
[1:19:12.340 --> 1:19:15.540]  And it was paper eventually and but through a custom URL scheme
[1:19:15.620 --> 1:19:21.300]  But then to make a nice user experience there was an API so Twitter tweetbot or whatever app
[1:19:21.300 --> 1:19:27.940]  You know Twitter if a whoever would call it if I send an insta paper colon slash slash URL
[1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:30.260]  Is it going to be handled?
[1:19:30.260 --> 1:19:33.860]  Yes or no, and then if it's the answer is no, it's like oh, well, they don't even have insta paper installed
[1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:40.940]  I won't even give them the option so Twitter you used it to survey whether or any of a thousand apps were installed on the system
[1:19:40.940 --> 1:19:45.460]  And and used it and then they of course know your Twitter account because you're logged into Twitter
[1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:51.060]  You're using Twitter. Yep, and it would transmit that data back to Twitter and they would save it probably forever on your account
[1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:58.100]  And they're at analytics database like all this creepy stuff that was made possible by this relatively innocent intending system API
[1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:05.860]  Yeah, and so that but this it's sort of a tangent, but it absolutely gets to something that is a false accusation against me
[1:20:05.860 --> 1:20:09.460]  which is that in in my defense of
[1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:19.460]  I think the problem that some people seem to have with my take on this is that I'm not an absoluteist that I don't feel like
[1:20:19.460 --> 1:20:25.300]  the and and I feel like there's some people who who want to say that if you're gonna block some ads
[1:20:25.300 --> 1:20:31.140]  You have to block them all and if you're going to whitelist some ads, you have to see them all and I
[1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:36.100]  I don't I think that's bullshit. I think it's I think it's provably bullshit because people are
[1:20:36.900 --> 1:20:43.620]  Doing just what I'm suggesting which is try to you know use whitelist and defaults for your ad blocker that
[1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:48.900]  Strike a middle ground and again who defines that middle ground and whether different people have
[1:20:49.540 --> 1:20:54.180]  Significantly different tastes on where that line is drawn. Absolutely. I don't who knows how it's gonna shake out
[1:20:54.180 --> 1:21:02.180]  But I absolutely think that someone who wants to take the the absoluteist all or nothing approach is is being stubbornly
[1:21:04.180 --> 1:21:08.500]  Idealistic. I don't know what the word is, but it's and they're fooling themselves
[1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:13.620]  But the the false accusation against me is that I'm somehow
[1:21:14.420 --> 1:21:16.580]  Because I'm in the bag for Apple and pro Apple
[1:21:17.060 --> 1:21:21.620]  I'm on board with Apple destroying the the open internet and
[1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:25.220]  Taking us to a world where there's nothing but apps from the app store
[1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:32.660]  And that's false for a couple of reasons number one my life's work is on a website and I don't have an app for it
[1:21:32.740 --> 1:21:36.580]  There is no daring far of all app, and I still have no plans to make one
[1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:45.300]  My site is in Apple news. I haven't done anything related to it. I really don't even understand how Apple news works
[1:21:46.580 --> 1:21:50.740]  I might I might do something with their stuff. I haven't really looked at it
[1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:54.340]  I
[1:21:54.340 --> 1:22:00.900]  Would be I would not be in favor of most people reading my site through Apple news. I'd not in favor of that and
[1:22:00.900 --> 1:22:09.060]  And lastly, I don't think I I'm just as suspicious and concerned about the tracking that's going on in native apps as I am on a web
[1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.020]  right because native apps like
[1:22:12.020 --> 1:22:13.380]  the web
[1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:17.620]  Can the web can do a lot more egregious things so it can do a lot more cross-site
[1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:23.300]  Tracking like tracking between different sites by third parties. The web makes a lot more of that possible
[1:22:23.700 --> 1:22:29.380]  apps you're you're mostly I mean depending on what they've integrated, but you're mostly in apps limited to
[1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:34.180]  The maker of the app tracking you themselves, right? You know and
[1:22:34.820 --> 1:22:39.700]  Again, there are there are some exceptions like put their party packages, but for the most part that's what's going on
[1:22:40.100 --> 1:22:42.260]  And so you do have to worry about things like
[1:22:43.140 --> 1:22:45.380]  Like the big the big social apps, which
[1:22:46.020 --> 1:22:49.940]  Again like when you're talking about if you want to block tracking you got a block social
[1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:55.780]  And all the social widgets there that are in all the sites you have to block the fancy rich
[1:22:55.780 --> 1:23:02.180]  Ricksley formatted Twitter embeds that people embed in blog post you would probably also have to block embedded YouTube players
[1:23:02.580 --> 1:23:05.700]  Because that's owned by Google a massive ad and tracking company
[1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:10.020]  You know like there's a lot you have to block if you want to block if you want to truly block tracking
[1:23:10.180 --> 1:23:12.740]  Yeah, if you just take a look a YouTube is a good example
[1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:16.020]  Because it's so ubiquitous. I mean it's you know
[1:23:16.180 --> 1:23:18.180]  It's central to the modern
[1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:19.540]  Web landscape
[1:23:19.540 --> 1:23:27.060]  But if you ever just do a view source on a page with a YouTube embed and just start going down the rabbit hole of the eye frame and
[1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:29.060]  And what's going on there?
[1:23:29.060 --> 1:23:32.820]  I mean it's it's almost impossible to follow along, but you can see that it is
[1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:40.580]  Nothing even vaguely resembling a video tag where the source pointing to a URL exactly
[1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:47.140]  It is you know it I'll bet like a single YouTube embed would probably involve more
[1:23:47.140 --> 1:23:53.220]  Mark up let alone JavaScript, but just more mark up than the entirety of like a typical daring fireball page
[1:23:53.860 --> 1:23:57.620]  Exactly, yeah, but so but you know with with app tracking
[1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:02.740]  You know you're you're they can do more detailed tracking of you
[1:24:03.220 --> 1:24:08.820]  But in a narrower scope like you're not usually like if you just open up a random
[1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:12.180]  You know a random app like if you're you know that there's a new
[1:24:12.180 --> 1:24:18.500]  Game from the cross-road people like shoot these skies or something today and I download that knowing like you know
[1:24:19.060 --> 1:24:20.580]  What's the most they can really do here?
[1:24:20.580 --> 1:24:24.500]  Like I know iOS is so sandboxed and everything like they're not gonna be able to get to all my other data
[1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:29.060]  They're not they're gonna be able to have like a unique identifier tied to me that they can use in
[1:24:29.620 --> 1:24:35.540]  You know 50 other apps that aren't even published by them and you know some other third-party thing to do like the cross-y road people have a new app
[1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:40.900]  Yeah, it's called shooty skies. Oh, it's a good. I haven't launched yet. Oh, I'm gonna
[1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:42.900]  I was gonna play it in bed tonight
[1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:46.900]  Play it in planning play it in a second half of the talk show
[1:24:48.260 --> 1:24:50.260]  Yeah, I'll play during all your ad reads
[1:24:52.660 --> 1:24:54.660]  No, I always pay attention to podcast ad reads
[1:24:55.380 --> 1:24:57.380]  Never skip them. So
[1:24:57.940 --> 1:25:02.340]  Is it nice? Do you like to enjoy not having to do them? Because you do them on ATP?
[1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:08.500]  Yeah, this was this was great like it's great to just show up to a podcast and just talk and not have to worry about like
[1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:12.820]  All right, got to get the sponsors ready got to make sure I have all the scripts for all them and if I don't I got to write some and
[1:25:13.220 --> 1:25:17.220]  You know review them and everything. Has there ever been any discussion about letting Casey do some of them?
[1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:24.740]  I don't think we've actually talked about it. I think he's kind of assumed. Yeah, he's he's someone's nicer than me John
[1:25:24.740 --> 1:25:25.780]  You should do it
[1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:28.500]  But John does the toaster ones which is yeah
[1:25:29.060 --> 1:25:35.820]  Is the greatest single greatest ad campaign in my opinion in podcast history is that there's a good one this week
[1:25:35.820 --> 1:25:38.500]  To this this is a toaster week this week. It's a good one
[1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:41.580]  It's a really good one
[1:25:41.740 --> 1:25:43.740]  It's cards against humanity's
[1:25:44.300 --> 1:25:49.340]  Campaign and for any of you I'm guessing is enormous number of the people listening to this episode
[1:25:49.340 --> 1:25:50.700]  Listen to ATP as well
[1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:54.020]  But for those of you who don't on on the accident on tech podcast
[1:25:54.020 --> 1:26:01.020]  There's a year long maybe over a year long. It's this whole calendar year. It's it's almost over
[1:26:01.020 --> 1:26:09.260]  It from cards against humanity and the entirety of the ad campaign. There is absolutely no talking points about the game itself
[1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:17.340]  It's they just sent John Syracuse a toaster oven every time an ad is coming up. Yeah
[1:26:17.340 --> 1:26:20.620]  Once a month once a month. They send him a toaster oven any
[1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:30.780]  Tears into it all there. Yeah, it's like the the entire role of the ad is for John to just review a new toaster oven every month
[1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:35.340]  Talk about the dials talk about you know how well it works. The knob feel, you know
[1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:38.540]  What egregious design mistakes that they've made? Yeah
[1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:42.060]  Turns out there's a lot of really badly designed toaster ovens out there
[1:26:44.780 --> 1:26:49.900]  He takes it totally serious as of course he does. It's fantastic. But anyway, it must be nice
[1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:53.100]  I don't know I enjoy it when I'm I guess on somebody else's podcast as well
[1:26:53.420 --> 1:26:54.380]  Yeah, it is quite nice
[1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:56.780]  Even though I do enjoy I actually enjoy doing these reads though
[1:26:56.780 --> 1:27:01.820]  I've gotten I think I've gotten better at it and I enjoy it because I've gotten to the point now where I feel like
[1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:06.460]  It's a game where I'm trying to keep people from hitting the 32nd skip
[1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:11.900]  I really and if you do if you know, you know, it is what it is and you know
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:14.140]  It's funny. It's
[1:27:14.140 --> 1:27:20.380]  Because that's a ad blocking right? I mean it ties into it. It's very similar. It's like it's not quite the same
[1:27:20.380 --> 1:27:22.620]  But it's very similar. It's it's in the ballpark for sure
[1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:27.340]  I actually saw somebody on Twitter in at at peak
[1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:29.340]  Peace
[1:27:29.340 --> 1:27:32.940]  Controverts. I still think that's so funny. They I think it was such a good name for a blocker
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:34.700]  I
[1:27:34.700 --> 1:27:37.580]  Think it's so funny that the way that it played out was
[1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:41.420]  So unpeaceful for you
[1:27:41.740 --> 1:27:43.740]  Yeah
[1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:46.780]  But I saw somebody who who tweeted
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:49.580]  something to the effect of
[1:27:49.580 --> 1:27:54.380]  It's actually a pretty clever idea that somebody who writes a podcast client could
[1:27:55.580 --> 1:28:02.140]  You know for any given episode of a show if you track to people's use of 32nd skip
[1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:05.500]  You could probably very easily pinpoint where the
[1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:09.820]  The sponsor breaks are in the episode
[1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:13.980]  Right and and you know, this is like I thought of this feature two years ago
[1:28:13.980 --> 1:28:20.300]  Like I think everybody who has made a podcast app has thought of this feature especially once Amazon launched their
[1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:23.900]  Shared highlights for kindles because it's very similar to that
[1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:28.220]  You know, it's like you you kind of traffic what people highlight and then things that get highlighted a lot
[1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:31.260]  You can say are important and you can default to highlight them well
[1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:35.740]  You could in a podcast app. Yeah, you could track what's being skipped and sections of a podcast that are skipped a lot
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:38.540]  You can have an option to just automatically just skip them and
[1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:44.620]  First of all, you know, it would be hard to make that work very well in a way that wouldn't annoy people
[1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:47.420]  And that would that would be obvious what's happening
[1:28:47.580 --> 1:28:48.540]  but second of all
[1:28:48.540 --> 1:28:54.540]  I think like I've talked to other other podcast app makers and mentioned this before and
[1:28:55.020 --> 1:29:00.460]  Everyone always does the same thing the same thing I thought which is I don't want to do that to podcasting
[1:29:01.180 --> 1:29:03.180]  because I know like
[1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:05.180]  That would that would by nature
[1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:08.220]  Hurt podcasting and I don't want to do that
[1:29:09.260 --> 1:29:14.140]  I you know, and I feel like the I feel like the other thing is that it's it's so
[1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:18.060]  Respectful, you know, it's just time, you know, and it's you know
[1:29:18.540 --> 1:29:20.540]  I I've gone to four
[1:29:21.100 --> 1:29:24.780]  Some of these summer episodes just because I've fallen way behind a weekly schedule
[1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:31.020]  But my episodes are very long and so I absolutely I do stick to never more than one and a half hour
[1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:36.540]  Um, which I feel like it's pretty fair and compares extremely favorably to
[1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:43.900]  Trust real radio. Oh my god. Yeah, and not even close and even compares. I think very well to
[1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:48.220]  Like the Howard Stern show on Sirius like Amy Amy's a huge
[1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:51.340]  Howard Stern fan and
[1:29:51.900 --> 1:29:57.980]  She's still annoyed by the fact that the whole thing that pitched her on Sirius in the first place is that it was commercial-free and
[1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:02.780]  And they were like except for Howard Stern because we can so a lot of very expensive bad on his show
[1:30:03.340 --> 1:30:08.060]  Um, you know, I think in the history of well, they aren't fair expensive. I bought them before
[1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:14.220]  Well, but from their perspective in the aggregate. They are I'm not saying you spot is but I think that it
[1:30:14.380 --> 1:30:19.100]  I don't think that they could do I don't think they could I don't think they could pay his salary if it wasn't for that
[1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:21.660]  I don't
[1:30:21.660 --> 1:30:27.020]  Yeah, I disagree you think you could go you think I paid less for a live read on his show
[1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:30.340]  Then what you and I charge for live reads on our shows right now
[1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:33.740]  That's amazing
[1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:40.620]  That's amazing, and you got you got Howard actually read it. Yeah. Yeah. It's still a lot of live read like that
[1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:44.140]  That's why it's valuable. It was really great. It was a really cool thing
[1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:49.300]  But anyway, I just feel like that the again, it's negotiation
[1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:52.380]  And I'm sure there are people out there listening right now who
[1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:58.780]  Even though I told them not to hit the 32nd thing during the Broward thing before and they're probably going to hit it on some of the ones
[1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:00.380]  That I'm about to do
[1:31:00.380 --> 1:31:03.020]  And that's okay. I mean, you know, it's my job
[1:31:03.020 --> 1:31:06.940]  But I feel like I've gotten better enough at doing this and I feel like I'm still attracting
[1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:14.380]  Interesting enough group of sponsors that it's a fun game for me when I do them to try to you know
[1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:17.820]  You know, I'm I'm I'm doing them. I'm imagining a
[1:31:17.820 --> 1:31:23.340]  a listener with his thumb hovering over the 32nd skip and I'm trying to keep him from pressing it
[1:31:23.900 --> 1:31:25.900]  Or at least only having an impressive ones
[1:31:26.220 --> 1:31:29.660]  Yeah, I mean, I still think there's some value in it like for example
[1:31:29.660 --> 1:31:32.020]  I will I'll break right into one right now and
[1:31:32.460 --> 1:31:39.180]  Here's one that I'll bet somebody I bet a fair number of people with 32nd skip because they are here almost every single week
[1:31:39.180 --> 1:31:41.180]  It's our friends at fracture
[1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:49.420]  Or they'll fracture the people who print your photos on glass they sponsor the show
[1:31:50.140 --> 1:31:55.740]  All the time and the reason they keep coming back is because you guys out there keep buying pictures from them
[1:31:56.300 --> 1:32:02.060]  So you're probably familiar with them really high quality printing they print on the back of the glass
[1:32:02.060 --> 1:32:04.140]  You send them a photo they print it on the back of the glass
[1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:09.500]  It's right there on the glass not like a piece of paper stuck to it. It's not a frame where there's a piece of paper behind glass
[1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:11.500]  It's right there on the glass
[1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:16.620]  Really really nice the best way to get actual analog versions of your photos that I've ever seen
[1:32:16.620 --> 1:32:18.460]  Because there's no work involved on your part
[1:32:18.460 --> 1:32:22.300]  You just upload the photo and then it comes back to you and it's all nice and ready to go
[1:32:22.940 --> 1:32:29.100]  They do have they actually have a special message that they want me to get across. It's only October 1st is I record
[1:32:30.860 --> 1:32:32.540]  Clearly a big part of fractures
[1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:39.500]  Market is gifts people buying photos for gifts and obviously the holiday season is coming up
[1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:44.140]  October 1st does not sound like it's close to the holidays. Nobody's I don't think
[1:32:44.540 --> 1:32:50.380]  Even though the holiday decorations seemed to go up earlier and earlier in retail usually people at least wait till Halloween
[1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:55.260]  Still in pumpkin spice season right now. Yeah exactly. You got to wait till pumpkin spice goes away
[1:32:55.260 --> 1:33:03.420]  But fracture wants me to remind you that they do get backed up at the holidays and so
[1:33:04.140 --> 1:33:07.900]  This might be a good way to just knock out a couple of your Christmas gifts
[1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:14.620]  Really really early and not worry about cutting it close and getting caught behind because at by the end of December
[1:33:14.620 --> 1:33:20.140]  They actually can't keep up and you can't do it last minute and get in time for Christmas because they're so so busy
[1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:24.700]  So think about it. Think about the people who you might want to give a fracture
[1:33:26.060 --> 1:33:30.940]  Image to for the holidays and get it over with now just do it and you'll feel better
[1:33:30.940 --> 1:33:34.140]  You'll know you have you know somewhere sitting in your office. You've got these boxes packed up
[1:33:34.860 --> 1:33:36.860]  You've already got some of your Christmas gifts
[1:33:37.180 --> 1:33:40.700]  Knocked out ready to go really is a good gift. We do it every year
[1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:44.140]  I can't even imagine until fracture isn't even around anymore
[1:33:44.140 --> 1:33:50.220]  I can't imagine that a holiday season is going to go by where we don't get some of these for some of the people in our family um
[1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:52.540]  Really really great stuff
[1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:54.540]  Where do you go to find out more?
[1:33:54.860 --> 1:33:59.180]  Their website is fractureme.com and
[1:33:59.980 --> 1:34:02.940]  There you are elk code is
[1:34:03.740 --> 1:34:10.140]  I think daring fireball and if you've never ordered for them before use that code daring fireball and you will save
[1:34:10.540 --> 1:34:12.540]  15% off
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:16.380]  Your listeners first order and if you're listening to this show if you're like a Marko fan
[1:34:16.380 --> 1:34:21.740]  You could use the code ATP and you'll save the same amount and you'll you'll give the the mojo to
[1:34:22.380 --> 1:34:25.780]  To the accidental tech podcast ATP 15
[1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:28.300]  ATP 15
[1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:34.140]  Well, did that change used to be ATP right or did they I think I think in 2015?
[1:34:34.140 --> 1:34:37.100]  I think it became me to be 15 anyway, you could they've been long-term that you know
[1:34:37.100 --> 1:34:41.020]  They responses before 2015. They've been long-term sponsors. Anyway, it's all good
[1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:44.860]  They're a great company with a truly truly great product and
[1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:49.420]  You know if you've ever wondered why in the world do they keep sponsoring these podcasts?
[1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:52.380]  I swear it's because people keep buying the fractures from them
[1:34:52.380 --> 1:34:56.540]  So so keep it up and it really really can't say enough about I just bought one as a gift a couple weeks ago
[1:34:56.540 --> 1:34:59.260]  I'm about to do another one. They make great gifts. Yeah
[1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:03.740]  You get you do get because most of the people in your family probably don't listen to your podcast
[1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:04.860]  Just like mine
[1:35:04.860 --> 1:35:10.060]  So they have no idea and when they see them they there really is like a whole like well, how did the world?
[1:35:10.060 --> 1:35:15.980]  Did you make this and you just say you know you could tell it just tell them you know go to fractured me calm
[1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:18.700]  Now I I have severe
[1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:21.340]  Gift giving anxiety every year
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:26.940]  And to have it to have an easy solution that's kind of like a go-to thing like if I don't know what to get somebody my family
[1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:33.100]  I can get them a cute picture of you know my grandparents or my kid or something. You know that works out well
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:38.620]  Yeah, I don't know you I'm always envious of your ad reads you and hello internet
[1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:43.900]  I think do the best live reads I've heard those bastards those guys. They aren't they frustratingly good
[1:35:44.140 --> 1:35:48.940]  Yeah, they don't let that actually because it's again. I do I don't like I listen to yours
[1:35:49.580 --> 1:35:54.860]  You know because I want to see how you do it, you know like it's a challenge. That's why I listen to it's just it
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:35:59.900]  You know like okay, it's squarespace again. What are you gonna do? You know, it's a challenge it is because I
[1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:04.860]  I want to keep it fresh for people who aren't skipping. I don't want to say the same thing every time
[1:36:04.860 --> 1:36:08.700]  The hello internet guys god. They're freaking really good at it
[1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:11.900]  Yeah, like it's frustrating enough that their podcast is so good in general
[1:36:11.900 --> 1:36:18.540]  But that that they also just kill it on the ad reads and that they require like I've always wanted to try recording the ads
[1:36:18.780 --> 1:36:20.780]  Separately from the show and dropping them in afterwards
[1:36:21.500 --> 1:36:30.140]  Because I don't like doing it during the show because it it makes me pay attention to something else during the show rather than what my co-host
[1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:35.260]  Or talking about and so like I always have my mind. Oh, I got to do another ad now. Oh, well what's it gonna be?
[1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:39.340]  A little up on screen maybe read it a couple times first like and I'm having to do all that as
[1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:43.340]  Casey or John are talking about something that and so I'm not listening to them
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:45.740]  I'm looking at an ad and so I feel like that makes the show worse
[1:36:46.540 --> 1:36:50.300]  But I I don't know I haven't figured out how to do it well yet
[1:36:50.300 --> 1:36:54.380]  Maybe I have to try it sometime and see I've I've been given serious thought to the exact same thing
[1:36:54.380 --> 1:36:59.660]  And I might play with it because I feel like it's the sort of thing I can I can play with and it's not irrevocable
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:03.900]  You know it. Yeah, but I feel like you do need some kind of sound effect to start and end it
[1:37:03.900 --> 1:37:06.700]  And I don't I don't have one of those ready and that's one of the reasons I haven't done it yet
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:11.260]  Because like if you just try to drop it in you sound different and everyone notices like it
[1:37:11.260 --> 1:37:14.140]  It is very obvious like this is your quarter of a different time
[1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:19.260]  Your voice is more or less tired and raspy than it was and like in the surrounding parts of the show
[1:37:19.420 --> 1:37:21.340]  You can hear maybe the room sends a little bit different
[1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:26.780]  Maybe it's like a little bit more echo-y or you were using the mic a little bit further away or a different mic that you were using two weeks ago
[1:37:26.780 --> 1:37:30.940]  Or something like you can always tell when it's when it was recorded at a different time
[1:37:30.940 --> 1:37:35.340]  Have you ever noticed me? I've done that a few times. Have you ever noticed? Yeah, every time
[1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:39.820]  I'll bet you did I notice every time and I listen to podcasts on terrible headphones
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:42.780]  And I notice every time, but that's just me. I'm a nerd
[1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:45.900]  But yeah, if I switched to that when I when I have done it
[1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:49.020]  It's because something has changed either. I've made a terrible mistake
[1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:51.740]  or somebody else has made a mistake and
[1:37:51.740 --> 1:37:57.260]  Or it I didn't get it in time, you know that there was some kind of communication problem
[1:37:57.260 --> 1:38:00.700]  And it's like crap. I told yeah, we're gonna record it nine. I don't have it
[1:38:01.100 --> 1:38:02.860]  I'll just fill it in later and you know
[1:38:03.420 --> 1:38:04.780]  And then when I've done that in the past
[1:38:04.780 --> 1:38:08.300]  I've tried to fake it as best we can to do it and if it doesn't come out perfectly
[1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:12.700]  So what if I were to switch I would switch to something where it's obvious and it's you know
[1:38:12.700 --> 1:38:16.540]  There's a little you know sound effect or something yeah a jingle or a sound yeah
[1:38:16.540 --> 1:38:19.260]  Something like that because I really do think it would like
[1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:25.100]  One of the reasons like I've I've always been interested in the idea of trying an ad-free show
[1:38:25.740 --> 1:38:29.580]  But ATP is so big now and and it's not just me that I had like you know
[1:38:30.140 --> 1:38:35.020]  I'm I'm willing to gamble with large amounts of money of potential future income
[1:38:35.340 --> 1:38:40.620]  But I can't make that decision for two other people alone, you know this and so I don't want to like rock the boat there
[1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:41.980]  but
[1:38:41.980 --> 1:38:47.660]  One of the reasons I was motivated to even consider rocking the boat there is because I don't like doing the ads in line because
[1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:50.780]  I am afraid of the attention. It's taking away
[1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:53.500]  Of my attention is taking away
[1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:58.620]  From the conversation and I think that makes it worse. So I should try that I got to figure out what sounds to book
[1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:00.620]  I did with and just try it
[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:03.820]  And I also like I heavily edit the ad reads because
[1:39:04.620 --> 1:39:06.620]  See this is why this is why you frustrate me
[1:39:07.340 --> 1:39:10.940]  Because I try to cap my ad reads to three minutes
[1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:12.860]  And ideally it's you know
[1:39:12.860 --> 1:39:19.900]  It's at least one and a half and it's at most three minutes and if I I almost always end up running way over that
[1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:21.980]  I'll usually I'll usually do it on the live show
[1:39:22.300 --> 1:39:26.380]  I'll usually do a four minute ad read and then in the edit I added it down to fit three
[1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:31.100]  And I still feel like I'm not saying everything I wanted to say in the read
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:35.820]  Meanwhile, you come in here and you talk at like one mile an hour during your ad reads
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:42.380]  And you manage to say everything that you need to say and they're not longer than three minutes usually like they're not that much
[1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:44.620]  Longer or shorter than mine. They see you manage to
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:50.140]  Somehow say way more with way fewer words in the same amount of time
[1:39:50.220 --> 1:39:55.500]  And your sounds more relaxed and more natural and mine sounds kind of stressed out because I'm trying to cram it all in in three minutes
[1:39:56.220 --> 1:40:00.620]  It's kind of how we ride I guess. Yeah, maybe mine were brutal at first. They were really bad
[1:40:00.860 --> 1:40:04.300]  I used to get and I didn't get emails complaining about it. I got emails
[1:40:05.020 --> 1:40:08.860]  Very sympathetic emails because even though when I first started doing the show on my own
[1:40:08.860 --> 1:40:11.020]  without
[1:40:11.020 --> 1:40:16.420]  Dan Benjamin and it was you know, obviously that was like my Marko moment where I really angered the internet
[1:40:16.620 --> 1:40:18.620]  The people who were angry weren't
[1:40:19.180 --> 1:40:24.900]  Refused to listen so they weren't listening and sending me hate mail about how bad the show was they weren't even listening
[1:40:24.900 --> 1:40:31.060]  And they were just you didn't even get the hate listeners. I got some but I think most of them were just didn't they did
[1:40:31.060 --> 1:40:33.060]  I really didn't get a lot of that
[1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:37.700]  I think they just went right to iTunes and wrote terrible one-star reviews and they were done
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:41.980]  The people who listened were people who were still enjoying it and they were very sympathetic
[1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:47.340]  And they were but it was sort of like the sort of email. I think that you get when you know you come down
[1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:51.940]  It was like this it was exactly like the email. I got when I talked about the stuff that's happened with my eye
[1:40:51.940 --> 1:40:55.140]  And you get these really nice emails when people say how sorry they are
[1:40:55.540 --> 1:41:00.540]  And they have I have all my sympathy and they're like, we're really sorry about the way you're doing these ad reads
[1:41:01.380 --> 1:41:04.260]  It's terrible. It was like I you know like I had an affliction
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:09.540]  Yeah, but you guys are pretty quickly. I mean I like yeah, those first few were definitely rough
[1:41:09.540 --> 1:41:12.780]  But I think by like the fifth or sixth episode you you were pretty much in a groove
[1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:17.700]  Yeah, well, if there's anything I did wrong, and I'm not a big fan of like I read that like the guy
[1:41:18.420 --> 1:41:24.620]  The Noah whatever his name is just taking over the daily show like he did like a whole week or so of test shows shows that are never gonna
[1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:31.540]  Air but real shows they do shows I understand why you do that and it you know hosting a TV show that's as tight as the daily show
[1:41:31.540 --> 1:41:35.860]  Really does have to be rehearsed um, but you can't rehearse the whole episode because every day
[1:41:35.860 --> 1:41:38.340]  It's that days news so you have to get good at it
[1:41:38.340 --> 1:41:41.300]  But if there's anything that that I should have rehearsed and thrown away
[1:41:41.300 --> 1:41:46.140]  I should have done sponsor reads instead of doing that. I should have just record you know not for episodes
[1:41:46.140 --> 1:41:48.140]  I should have recorded some
[1:41:48.140 --> 1:41:53.340]  And enforced myself to listen to them and do it because it didn't take too long
[1:41:53.340 --> 1:41:56.020]  I only took a couple weeks before I got at least okay at it
[1:41:56.020 --> 1:42:01.660]  And I so I could have just skipped the point where I was really really terrible at it. Well, yeah
[1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:05.980]  But that was that was part of the learning process. Yeah, you know you wouldn't have learned it necessarily
[1:42:06.980 --> 1:42:12.660]  Anyway, the thing that really got me was the last episode of Hello Internet when Brady did the the fracture one
[1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:16.500]  Oh, and it was that he had sent a picture to
[1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:20.300]  CGP Gray sent a fracture to them to him of
[1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:25.900]  What was it that you make in rat one of the two animals that he's been obsessed with lately?
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:32.300]  Yeah, I'm not the hand the hands. Yeah, the other one. Yeah, the official bird of Hello Internet, right?
[1:42:32.300 --> 1:42:34.300]  But had sent him a picture
[1:42:34.940 --> 1:42:39.460]  That related to an entire huge segment of the show that it had already been gone
[1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:44.500]  So it was it just had this beautiful serendipity and and really made it feel like it was a
[1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:49.900]  Part of the show again like I said ads are content part of the content
[1:42:49.900 --> 1:42:51.900]  What you're serving is the ads?
[1:42:51.900 --> 1:42:55.180]  It's not something separate and the hello Internet the way they do it
[1:42:55.180 --> 1:42:57.580]  It it it it really does feel like part of the show
[1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:00.300]  Those guys are so frustrating
[1:43:01.660 --> 1:43:07.620]  They and like they have like they mentioned their numbers on the last show they have they have way bigger
[1:43:07.620 --> 1:43:09.540]  Listener bases than we do too. Oh, yeah
[1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:11.620]  It's with good reason because their show is awesome
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:16.580]  And it's like people can enjoy that show without being huge tech nerds like our shows
[1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:20.180]  You pretty much have to be a huge Apple nerds to really get much out of our shows
[1:43:20.500 --> 1:43:24.580]  But their show is way more accessible and it really like they they joke about
[1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:30.340]  Long time ago. They had a discussion about the two dudes talking podcast format, which is very common
[1:43:31.060 --> 1:43:33.460]  Especially the two dudes talking loosely about tech matters
[1:43:34.180 --> 1:43:40.020]  But I think what makes their show so great is that yes, there are a lot of two dudes talking shows
[1:43:40.020 --> 1:43:47.060]  But they really perfected that format like it like to have these two specific people talking about
[1:43:47.340 --> 1:43:53.180]  Whatever they talk about like they have amazing host chemistry between the two of them and they're both amazing
[1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:57.660]  Characters like they're they're incredibly amusing to listen to and they play off each other well
[1:43:57.660 --> 1:43:59.420]  And it's very nicely edited
[1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:04.700]  So you have this combination of just like no wonder it's so popular because they're really good at it
[1:44:04.700 --> 1:44:08.300]  And it's a really combination to begin with yeah, they also both have good voices
[1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.300]  Yeah, she really can't help and
[1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:15.540]  You know, what are you gonna do but well? That's one thing that I love about podcast in though?
[1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:21.100]  I this whole episode is gonna be frustrating for like half the listeners who wants to talk about whatever Apple news happened this week
[1:44:21.540 --> 1:44:25.140]  But one thing I love about podcasting like when I was a kid
[1:44:25.140 --> 1:44:29.020]  I used to I think a lot of people did this who are especially who are nerds like me
[1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:32.540]  I used to record fake radio shows with my friends
[1:44:32.540 --> 1:44:39.660]  Which would basically like us talking into a cassette recorder as if we were on the radio and never listening back to it
[1:44:39.660 --> 1:44:41.980]  Or listening back once and then that would be it
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:47.700]  Like I we'd make these fake like I always want it to be a radio DJ and the reality is a
[1:44:48.940 --> 1:44:50.940]  That is a terrible business
[1:44:51.740 --> 1:44:58.780]  Business of being an actual radio DJ is horrible. So that's problem number one problem number two is
[1:44:58.780 --> 1:45:04.180]  I was never going to be a DJ. I don't have the right voice. I don't speak well enough
[1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:09.380]  I certainly don't have the background or the opportunity to become a DJ or the training like I you know
[1:45:09.940 --> 1:45:15.180]  If there was any training like I was never going to be a DJ. I just I don't have the voice for it
[1:45:15.180 --> 1:45:19.460]  I don't have the skills for it. I'm just not cut out for that job in the same way
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:24.780]  I'm not cut out to be like you know a football player like I'm just that's just I don't have I'm not the person for that
[1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:26.780]  I'm not I'm not made for that
[1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:28.780]  But with podcasting
[1:45:28.780 --> 1:45:34.220]  It's it's really quite a meritocracy and that like one of the beauties of this medium is that you don't need to attract
[1:45:34.460 --> 1:45:37.580]  The wide audience that you know TV and radio people do normally
[1:45:38.460 --> 1:45:40.700]  With like the locality issues and everything
[1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:43.420]  With this with podcasting
[1:45:43.580 --> 1:45:45.260]  Even people who talk
[1:45:45.260 --> 1:45:48.220]  Sloppily and have mediocre voices like me
[1:45:48.860 --> 1:45:52.780]  Can my job is podcasting. I I talk on
[1:45:52.780 --> 1:46:00.380]  A version of the radio for a living and the the idea that like I'm fulfilling this childhood dream of this thing
[1:46:00.380 --> 1:46:03.820]  I've always wanted to do that I really am not qualified to do
[1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:12.340]  But it just happens to work out better in this medium like that is amazing to me and and as a listener of podcasts as a massive listener of
[1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:13.820]  Podcasts I
[1:46:13.820 --> 1:46:17.820]  Love listening to other shows that are also made by amateurs like me
[1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:24.380]  That are just talking about interesting stuff, and that's something I like I know I all the like the big like public radio
[1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:29.020]  Podcasts I don't listen to almost any of them because there's so much else
[1:46:29.580 --> 1:46:32.380]  Going on that I want to listen to I don't have time for them
[1:46:32.860 --> 1:46:38.860]  Because there's so much else that's made by amateurs and people like me that I'm much more interested in that's much more narrowly focused
[1:46:39.180 --> 1:46:44.140]  Then like here's a story I'm gonna tell you about something interesting that happened, you know like I don't I don't need that
[1:46:44.220 --> 1:46:47.180]  I have my all my time is filled up with people
[1:46:47.180 --> 1:46:50.220]  Talking about more narrow interest that I that I like better
[1:46:51.580 --> 1:46:53.580]  I totally agree
[1:46:53.820 --> 1:47:02.140]  But it's it still makes me jealous when I hear the professional some of hello internet. Yeah, it is it is frustrating when people are
[1:47:02.940 --> 1:47:06.780]  Really good podcasters who also have really good voices and production and speak well
[1:47:08.300 --> 1:47:11.900]  There's such they're too such interesting characters as well and exactly
[1:47:11.900 --> 1:47:12.860]  I think they're very honest
[1:47:12.860 --> 1:47:15.500]  I don't think that they've made up personas and they're just being themselves
[1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:19.260]  But they're you know, they both seem like very very nice very nice fellows
[1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:22.780]  absolutely, yeah, and like you know like
[1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:26.540]  Gray is obviously the straight guy, you know, he's the
[1:47:27.500 --> 1:47:28.460]  You know
[1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:32.700]  He's the more logical and doesn't come up with wacky ideas thing
[1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:37.100]  But then he's got the crazy tick like that always comes up where he flies
[1:47:38.220 --> 1:47:43.820]  He books a standby ticket and will wait weeks and weeks and weeks with not knowing when he's gonna fly
[1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:49.980]  Which is crazy. Yeah, that that's why that show is so great because like you have these these great
[1:47:50.860 --> 1:47:53.740]  interesting people who and and like and
[1:47:54.220 --> 1:47:56.940]  The fact that Brady can like tease that out of him and then
[1:47:57.500 --> 1:48:01.740]  Hit him over the head with it constantly like they they're able to push each other's buttons extremely well as well
[1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:05.260]  Like it is it is oh, it's so good. Yeah, it's really good show
[1:48:05.260 --> 1:48:09.980]  So anybody who hasn't listened to a girl listen to it, but you know, they're they're well beyond like you said
[1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:14.860]  They're well beyond our the size of our audiences. We should have them talk about us for an hour. Yeah, deservedly
[1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:16.700]  So the funny thing was that they did a thing too
[1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:19.180]  They've done a thing which is which is actually interesting
[1:48:19.180 --> 1:48:23.180]  I've been me thinking it's funny that you bring it up because I was gonna bring it up so anybody out there do
[1:48:24.940 --> 1:48:32.140]  They did a thing where they solicited for the listeners of their show to write to them and tell them if they listen to the show
[1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:36.540]  While doing interesting things like what is the context?
[1:48:36.540 --> 1:48:40.380]  You know something beyond just you know, I listen to the show when I drive to work
[1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:44.700]  You know, and there's people who are like there's like a guy who's like a surgeon
[1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:48.700]  He does like surgery on like mice brains because he's studying
[1:48:48.700 --> 1:48:55.300]  You know the effects you know some kind of scientist and they put the mice through a study and then he performed surgery on their brain to see their effect
[1:48:55.340 --> 1:48:59.740]  So while he's doing as he lists one of the things he does he listens to podcasts and he listened to their show
[1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:01.740]  Well, that's an interesting thing
[1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:03.740]  and they had
[1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:10.540]  They had a guy who who man's the
[1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:16.940]  The ladder. Why don't you call it the steps that like Air Force one like when Air Force one lands
[1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:23.820]  He's the guy who like puts the ladder up there where the president comes down. Yeah, the stair car, right? Yeah, the stair car
[1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:30.780]  listens to their show while he does you know and and and even like said like and just to make sure this guy doesn't get in trouble
[1:49:30.780 --> 1:49:36.700]  He's very very clear. He does this like in the you know like you have to stand here and wait for four hours for the president to connect
[1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:41.020]  Well, he's not he's not listening while the president might be coming down the steps
[1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:43.020]  He's you know, he's paying attention
[1:49:43.740 --> 1:49:44.620]  and doing his job
[1:49:44.620 --> 1:49:51.100]  But it's it's obviously it's a job with a lot of waiting involved because they you know the president shows up when the president shows up
[1:49:51.100 --> 1:49:53.820]  The president you know isn't you know running on a clock
[1:49:54.460 --> 1:49:55.820]  What an interesting job though
[1:49:55.820 --> 1:50:03.340]  And to think that that guy you know is is alleviating the tedium of the waiting part of his job or while he's off duty or whatever
[1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:09.020]  By listening to their show. So anybody I would I would be interested to know the same thing if there are interesting
[1:50:09.020 --> 1:50:15.180]  Context where people listen to the talk show so you can you know just email them to me and maybe I'll read some of them
[1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:17.820]  In a future episode
[1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:21.580]  I don't know anything about my audience
[1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:24.460]  Like you said like that the you know the idea of
[1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:28.300]  You got it. You have to hook up the data and collect all the analytics for everything
[1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:32.380]  I don't want to know I do like knowing what's popular
[1:50:32.380 --> 1:50:33.660]  I like to try to you know
[1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:38.620]  I try to look at the stats and mint and just to see if an article is unusually popular
[1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:40.380]  um
[1:50:40.380 --> 1:50:43.180]  And I I like to see
[1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:46.380]  I actually it's not really an audience tracking though
[1:50:46.380 --> 1:50:47.100]  It's you know
[1:50:47.100 --> 1:50:54.060]  I like to see referral tracking and see if I'm getting an unusual amount of traffic from some other popular place or site or tweet
[1:50:54.060 --> 1:50:56.060]  You know
[1:50:56.060 --> 1:51:01.500]  But in terms of like knowing things about the audience. I don't I don't I don't want to know that
[1:51:02.220 --> 1:51:06.060]  Yeah, well, that's like even even like the checking of the mint and everything
[1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:08.860]  Like back when I wrote the the
[1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:12.220]  My previous controversy
[1:51:13.180 --> 1:51:15.180]  The the apple a funk and a high ground thing
[1:51:16.060 --> 1:51:18.860]  After that went crazy. I realized that
[1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:24.780]  I like there was a day where like I just turned off analytics for the site during that because I was just kind of like
[1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:27.100]  I don't I don't want to be motivated by this anymore
[1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:32.620]  And it's kind of like if you if you've forgotten a vacation and and you stop checking Twitter for a while and then
[1:51:33.100 --> 1:51:37.900]  You have such a massive pile up that you can't keep up and you just hit scroll to top and you realize like
[1:51:38.140 --> 1:51:42.140]  Oh, I didn't read Twitter for like three or four days and I missed nothing of importance
[1:51:42.860 --> 1:51:44.380]  Um, and
[1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:49.500]  It's kind of eye-opening well. I had a similar kind of thing with with analytics on my website where I ran
[1:51:50.220 --> 1:51:54.380]  First mint for a while and also I ran google analytics for a while and and
[1:51:55.180 --> 1:51:57.180]  And eventually I realized
[1:51:57.180 --> 1:52:00.140]  When I turned it off for a little while after the in the wake of all that drama
[1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:03.100]  I was I just was like I want some some peace and quiet
[1:52:03.820 --> 1:52:08.620]  I turned it off for a while and I realized I didn't miss it at all
[1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:11.740]  And and part of that is a luxury that we have that
[1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:16.380]  You know, we don't need to really know our day-to-day page views the deck
[1:52:16.940 --> 1:52:23.580]  Bill's in advance for page views basically and so we are paid a flat rate by the deck based on
[1:52:23.900 --> 1:52:27.020]  The general amount of traffic that we tend to have gotten over the last
[1:52:27.100 --> 1:52:30.700]  You know years or whatever like my rate for the deck hasn't changed in years
[1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:38.780]  And because my traffic is you know about the same and so you know it's it isn't if I write something that gets all of a sudden a million
[1:52:38.780 --> 1:52:42.060]  Page views out of the blue. I'm not going to see you know the dime for that
[1:52:42.060 --> 1:52:46.620]  Right the deck has pre sold the the ads for that and so they aren't seeing the dime for it and you know
[1:52:46.620 --> 1:52:48.940]  That's just so I so we have no incentive
[1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:55.740]  to like temporarily juice page views or or write things that are going to get temporary traffic really and
[1:52:56.540 --> 1:53:01.340]  And so the only reason I would really need to run web analytics of any kind
[1:53:02.060 --> 1:53:07.820]  Is what you say is like for me to know like oh, where's traffic coming from and where you know
[1:53:07.820 --> 1:53:10.300]  What what do I write that gets?
[1:53:10.860 --> 1:53:17.340]  Meaningful numbers compared to anything else I write and what I realized was that that information was not beneficial to my life
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:19.820]  Well, or my work it it was
[1:53:20.620 --> 1:53:25.740]  All it was doing was like being another vanity metric to check and the reality is Twitter is that vanity metric now
[1:53:25.740 --> 1:53:27.660]  Anyway, and I should probably stop checking that as well
[1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:31.260]  But I still do like I will check the number of retweets that
[1:53:31.740 --> 1:53:33.980]  Like whenever I write a blog post I tweet about it also
[1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:38.380]  So I'll check my number of retweets that got and I have some idea like oh well
[1:53:38.380 --> 1:53:43.340]  This one got you know two and this one got 40 so obviously that resonated with more people
[1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:48.540]  But the actual web avatar web tracking at that level for for whatever reason
[1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:53.260]  I've decided that's no longer a thing that that I need to care about and so I don't run any yeah
[1:53:53.260 --> 1:53:59.900]  I like to know some of the user agent stuff and I can I I can get this out of my server logs
[1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:04.700]  It's just that and that's the one thing I've been talking about getting rid of Google Analytics
[1:54:04.700 --> 1:54:10.220]  I'm going to I mean I'm it's seriously just a matter of days that I just unhook it
[1:54:10.220 --> 1:54:12.220]  I probably should just do it tomorrow
[1:54:12.540 --> 1:54:18.780]  And mainly because I think that it's privacy invasive and I I actually think that it's
[1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:24.700]  You know wrong of me to to be using in Google Analytics and it they have a very opaque
[1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:29.860]  Privacy policy that that as I've read it and I've done this over the I've been using
[1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:33.700]  Google Analytics for years and there was a whole year or two period where I stopped using it
[1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:36.100]  and I missed some data like
[1:54:36.820 --> 1:54:43.380]  What percentage of my users are using which browser and what percentage of them are on iOS versus you know
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:47.620]  macOS versus other operating systems and there's ways to get that without using analytics
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:48.980]  But Google just
[1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:54.980]  Rehooking up Google Analytics was the easiest way to do it and then I felt bad because a lot of my long-term stats
[1:54:54.980 --> 1:54:59.540]  We're entirely out of whack because I had this like 14 month period where I'd shut it off
[1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:06.540]  But I've read their private the privacy issue is the main thing that makes me want to shut it off above and beyond anything else
[1:55:06.540 --> 1:55:15.540]  Is that I can't shake the suspicion that Google is using the cookies they said for Google Analytics to track the people who read daring fireball across
[1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:21.380]  The web and using it for advertising even though I don't use any Google advertising and if you read their privacy policy
[1:55:21.380 --> 1:55:28.340]  It's impossible to me at least it's like to me. It's like reading a foreign language, and it's the way that I'm I'm amazed and impressed by
[1:55:29.540 --> 1:55:36.340]  Attorneys who who write the contracts that run the whole world because I think I'm a good reader
[1:55:36.340 --> 1:55:39.380]  I've always tested it high in terms of reading comprehension
[1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:45.140]  I read most most contracts and I it might as well be written in a foreign language. I don't understand anything
[1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:47.140]  I don't understand what is going on
[1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:52.260]  And Google's privacy policy for analytics is to me that type of privacy policy
[1:55:52.260 --> 1:55:57.620]  I I understand what each of the words mean and then the aggregate. I have no idea what it means and
[1:55:58.260 --> 1:56:04.740]  I've come to the conclusion that if you don't understand what a privacy policy means you your worst assumptions are probably right
[1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:06.100]  right
[1:56:06.100 --> 1:56:11.940]  No, and you know you're right that you know by by having Google Analytics on your site
[1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:17.860]  You are selling your visitor's data to Google without their knowledge
[1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:24.100]  And it's one of the things like it's kind of uncomfortable like you know like a lot of the things in in web publishing and advertising
[1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:29.700]  If you actually face it if you actually like think about all the ramifications of that and you face the truth of that
[1:56:29.700 --> 1:56:33.940]  And you face the reality of that it is uncomfortable and and you have to you know
[1:56:33.940 --> 1:56:38.980]  You have to weigh this decision of like you know do I keep using this for the utility it provides
[1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:44.660]  Or do I take a principled stand and and and accept the cost of that stand?
[1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:49.940]  So Google Analytics gives you information like how many people are in what country and even like within the u.s
[1:56:49.940 --> 1:56:53.300]  Like what state like how many you know and and unsurprisingly
[1:56:53.300 --> 1:56:57.940]  You know by site is largely us a lot of people in the u.k. A lot of people in Germany
[1:56:57.940 --> 1:57:00.340]  I think Germany's always been the third country
[1:57:00.340 --> 1:57:05.300]  But you're already down at a very low percentage and then everybody else is spread around the world and then within the u.s
[1:57:05.300 --> 1:57:14.340]  Tons of people on the northeast coast most of them in California and most of them in California largely centered in the northern part of California
[1:57:14.820 --> 1:57:15.860]  Um
[1:57:15.860 --> 1:57:19.540]  You know, it's exactly who you think I don't need Google Analytics to tell me that though
[1:57:19.540 --> 1:57:27.300]  And I find it weird and I just wonder how the hell did they know that and I know there's ways to to go back from IP addresses and stuff like that
[1:57:27.300 --> 1:57:32.820]  And but I just can't help but worry that part of it is that if you're logged into Google from Gmail
[1:57:32.820 --> 1:57:39.540]  And then you go over to a separate tab and you're during fireball that they're they're saying oh, we know Marco lives in New York because
[1:57:40.820 --> 1:57:45.700]  We know everything about Marco and we've already got a cookie on this system that's right there that does this
[1:57:46.020 --> 1:57:48.020]  Right, and it doesn't take much
[1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:56.100]  To uniquely identify somebody between sites in the web like you can just by analyzing some very basic stuff about the the request
[1:57:56.100 --> 1:57:58.100]  They make even if they block almost every kind of ad
[1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:02.980]  You know if if they come to your side a couple times and if they you know you couldn't you can just kind of match
[1:58:03.620 --> 1:58:08.420]  even if they're IP changed you can just match like somebody's approximate zip code by using IP lookup
[1:58:09.060 --> 1:58:10.660]  and
[1:58:10.660 --> 1:58:16.740]  Match that with like the request headers that their browser send which includes like the browser's version like the exact version
[1:58:17.060 --> 1:58:23.620]  The OS exact version and stuff like that. Maybe sometimes like if it has certain plugins then the plugin version like flat like flash or Java
[1:58:23.620 --> 1:58:31.060]  Like it'll those are all in the in the headers of the vids that it sounds like a request so if you just take a couple of those things a couple of those data points
[1:58:31.540 --> 1:58:38.260]  You can you need to identify people surprisingly quickly like with only two or three different data points of that kind of set so
[1:58:39.220 --> 1:58:45.940]  You really is is very much like if you give them an ink to take a foot like you have to be very careful what you allow
[1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:53.140]  On your site if you want to actually be productive of people's privacy and you have to be aware as a visitor that you know
[1:58:53.140 --> 1:58:56.660]  You might think you're that you have more privacy, but in reality
[1:58:57.300 --> 1:58:58.340]  You are
[1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:05.220]  Inadvertently leaking data all over the place to everybody who's willing to capture it and it's and you might not care most people don't
[1:59:05.460 --> 1:59:11.460]  Think about it and they they might not care if you told them, but and especially young people tend not to care but
[1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:20.820]  Certainly if your privacy minded you have to be incredibly wary of what you let it because you know they can they can do so much with so little
[1:59:20.820 --> 1:59:25.620]  If you go if you're logged in to Google analytic side
[1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:29.300]  I was here and and you go to the bottom. I don't maybe they have a separate one
[1:59:29.300 --> 1:59:36.260]  I don't know, but when you go and hit privacy policy. It just takes you to Google's main privacy policy, which is for
[1:59:38.260 --> 1:59:40.260]  You know everything that Google does
[1:59:41.220 --> 1:59:45.540]  So it's just I don't even know if that's what they mean, you know
[1:59:45.540 --> 1:59:52.740]  Like what I want to know is a publisher is what are my readers being exposed to here and what's being tracked about them
[1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:55.140]  And it doesn't seem like there's any good way to get that answer
[1:59:55.860 --> 1:59:59.940]  Or if there is I I'll be damned if I can find it and to me that's just worry some
[2:00:00.740 --> 2:00:02.980]  So I don't know. I really got to get rid of it
[2:00:03.780 --> 2:00:08.420]  I'm sure there's other ways I can do it. I don't know. I'm there's this the system
[2:00:08.420 --> 2:00:12.100]  I'm thinking about installing is called ppwick pywick p i w i k
[2:00:12.100 --> 2:00:16.020]  Yeah, that's that's a pretty common one. Yeah, I'm not quite sure what information is there
[2:00:16.020 --> 2:00:18.020]  But the gist of
[2:00:18.020 --> 2:00:22.980]  Pywick pwick whatever it's called is that it's like mint and that it's locally stored
[2:00:23.300 --> 2:00:26.500]  And so I would be running it my own copy of it on my server
[2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:34.820]  Storing my copy of the stats in my SQL database and it's there are no cookies that are shared across other sites
[2:00:34.980 --> 2:00:40.660]  Or anything like that that would track you all it is is knowledge of what people coming to my site do
[2:00:40.660 --> 2:00:42.660]  So there'd be nothing
[2:00:42.660 --> 2:00:47.940]  Privacy invasive about it at all other than the fact that you are a person who is reading my site which you know
[2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:49.940]  I obviously do know
[2:00:51.140 --> 2:00:54.340]  Some of the stats though that from I don't know what pywick has
[2:00:54.340 --> 2:00:56.740]  But some of the stuff like that is interesting and I will miss
[2:00:56.740 --> 2:00:59.060]  But I don't miss it enough to keep using Google Analytics
[2:00:59.060 --> 2:01:04.580]  It's like the number of people using which browser and how many people use which operating system and stuff like that
[2:01:04.660 --> 2:01:06.660]  We're and some of that you can get out of the user region
[2:01:06.660 --> 2:01:11.460]  But a lot of it you you have you JavaScript to get is like things like you know whether it has read in a screen or not
[2:01:11.460 --> 2:01:15.380]  But I I just think so much that stuff is just becoming so irrelevant
[2:01:15.620 --> 2:01:18.580]  You know like like what what would you actually do with that information?
[2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:20.740]  You know most of it is not that important
[2:01:21.300 --> 2:01:25.780]  Well, any other fact is that I don't like I truly do believe like I'll say it over and over again
[2:01:25.780 --> 2:01:26.980]  If there's a theme of this episode
[2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:30.420]  It's that everything you publish on your site is content and counts
[2:01:30.980 --> 2:01:35.620]  And so I don't I don't want JavaScript executing that's set it getting the bounds of the screen
[2:01:35.620 --> 2:01:39.860]  It's a waste of CPU time, you know, and you know, I get all Syracuse here
[2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:47.300]  But I'm sure it doesn't take very long for a little bit of JavaScript to just figure out what the current screen size is and send it back
[2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:54.260]  But every little thing you do that test like that adds up to something and all of a sudden you've got you know
[2:01:54.980 --> 2:01:59.300]  Five seconds of load time for ads and trackers and analytics
[2:01:59.300 --> 2:02:05.700]  You know, and each little step of it is you know a tenth of a second
[2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:07.060]  Exactly
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:09.060]  So anyway, I've got to get rid of Google Analytics
[2:02:13.060 --> 2:02:16.900]  I might as well take a break right here and talk about our next sponsor it is
[2:02:17.780 --> 2:02:24.660]  Is a new sponsor first-time sponsor of the show that are called just works j us t w o r k s
[2:02:24.660 --> 2:02:26.660]  uh
[2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:33.300]  Running payroll filing w2s negotiating health care prices. I'm already asleep. This sounds terrible
[2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:36.420]  These are all the things that if you're a small business owner
[2:02:37.780 --> 2:02:41.300]  That you could be doing instead of listening to the talk show
[2:02:41.780 --> 2:02:43.780]  Uh sounds like a lot of fun, right?
[2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:53.540]  Well, you could instead just let just works take care of that stuff for you. Just works helps businesses take care of all that type of
[2:02:53.540 --> 2:02:55.540]  Let's face it crap
[2:02:55.540 --> 2:03:01.460]  Benefits payroll HR not that it's crap that it doesn't matter. I think most of your employees think payroll is very important
[2:03:01.940 --> 2:03:09.220]  But the bookkeeping aspects of it actually doing the work of making it run and making all the books add up and making sure everybody gets paid with their supposed
[2:03:09.220 --> 2:03:15.860]  We paid busy work, right? You're not so bad. You're not in a business of running payroll. You're in the business of whatever your business is
[2:03:16.340 --> 2:03:19.780]  So check them out their website is just works.com
[2:03:19.780 --> 2:03:24.340]  Uh they help businesses take care of this stuff. They do it all for you
[2:03:25.300 --> 2:03:32.100]  Running a successful business is hard enough doing the actual business of whatever your business is whatever it is making apps
[2:03:32.660 --> 2:03:35.940]  Making websites selling coffee whatever it could be
[2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:42.900]  But all those little details of HR and payroll and stuff like that can make it feel overwhelming
[2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:47.060]  It's probably the sort of thing that keeps a lot of people from even starting a small business in the first place
[2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:50.900]  Because you just think well who the hell am I you know, I can't afford to hire somebody to do this
[2:03:51.140 --> 2:03:53.140]  Well just works
[2:03:53.460 --> 2:03:56.340]  It's just easy and intuitive software very very affordable
[2:03:57.140 --> 2:04:00.020]  Great prices. It's not like you're hiring somebody to do this for you
[2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:04.100]  You're paying a little internet service to do it and take care of it
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:11.780]  So if you run a business and you have payroll you have benefits compliance with HR stuff like that
[2:04:12.420 --> 2:04:15.780]  Go check them out at just works.com
[2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:19.540]  Take it all off your shoulders relax listen to more podcasts
[2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:23.940]  And you can use this code very easy. This is a nice code TTS
[2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:31.140]  The talk show three letter code when you sign up and you'll save 10% off your first year of service
[2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:32.500]  It just works.com
[2:04:32.820 --> 2:04:36.260]  So if you run a business go check them out. You're you're just wasting your time if you don't
[2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:42.020]  Probably a good sponsor for the show. I bet there's a lot of people who run
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:48.980]  Companies have to do stuff like that. Yeah, I had to do that for a little while and I use one of the other big services to do it and
[2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:55.700]  They forgot to file the state workers comp stuff and I had to I was threatened by New York state to have to pay
[2:04:56.260 --> 2:04:58.260]  $15,000 a day
[2:04:58.260 --> 2:05:02.980]  Until it was resolved and I was able to negotiate that down and only pay a few thousand bucks, but man
[2:05:03.860 --> 2:05:11.140]  Yeah, you want a company that does that right and I can tell you the big guys don't always so I would definitely give just works a shot
[2:05:11.140 --> 2:05:15.700]  Yeah, really good. Um, I would definitely do it. I'd say anything
[2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:18.500]  It's always worth reevaluating your life
[2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:20.260]  Anything that is a pain in your ass
[2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:24.420]  You should look and see if there's a way that you can pay someone to do it for you
[2:05:25.700 --> 2:05:32.340]  Yeah, that's a really good rule in general and it's it is it it's the best part of
[2:05:32.980 --> 2:05:39.380]  The internet era of modern society is that an entirely new realm of things
[2:05:39.380 --> 2:05:41.380]  can be
[2:05:41.940 --> 2:05:47.140]  Automated that just wasn't feasible before right like you know
[2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:52.980]  You know, it's a silly example, but like those the buttons that Amazon gives you out now
[2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:57.940]  So like when you're running out of detergent you can just hit a button and and have detergent sent to your house
[2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:03.220]  But there's no way that could have them before the internet, right? There's no way before the internet that
[2:06:04.180 --> 2:06:08.940]  That you could just easily set up a thing that would do the payroll and HR for your company
[2:06:08.940 --> 2:06:13.820]  Like it just wasn't feasible. How how would you interact with them? You need the internet and a website?
[2:06:13.820 --> 2:06:15.900]  You need some way of interacting with them, you know
[2:06:16.460 --> 2:06:19.980]  Like the Sears catalog existed so you could order stuff
[2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:25.580]  To get shipped to your house before the internet, but you can't have like a print-based
[2:06:25.900 --> 2:06:31.100]  Interaction with the company that's handling your HR, you know, I think you have to use a fax machine
[2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:33.740]  Maybe an LP player
[2:06:33.740 --> 2:06:40.060]  You know, I think right now I might be this might be a good thing to keep track of is how long I've gone
[2:06:40.620 --> 2:06:45.660]  without being asked to either send or receive a fax and I think I
[2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:50.220]  Think if I had been doing that, you know, like this many days since an accident at the plant
[2:06:50.220 --> 2:06:53.420]  I think I think that right now knock on wood
[2:06:53.420 --> 2:07:00.380]  I might be in the longest stretch of not having been asked to do a fax in my life
[2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:07.420]  I believe by a house. Oh, you serious. Oh, yeah, that's gonna break your stretch day if you're if you're gonna buy a house in time
[2:07:07.420 --> 2:07:12.140]  So I'm pretty sure they still I mean these days you can usually
[2:07:12.780 --> 2:07:19.500]  Somebody who asks you to fax something you can usually say can I scan it and email to you instead and usually they will say yes
[2:07:19.900 --> 2:07:21.900]  But but not always
[2:07:22.620 --> 2:07:26.700]  And you know the percentage of time you can do that is going up. Thank God, but
[2:07:26.700 --> 2:07:33.820]  I don't have a working scanner in the house or I do I shouldn't say I don't have a working scanner. I've got a doxy
[2:07:35.660 --> 2:07:38.060]  But I don't you got to go snit you got to go scan snap
[2:07:39.100 --> 2:07:41.740]  I don't I don't have I don't know where it is and
[2:07:42.300 --> 2:07:47.260]  Amy I've mentioned this before Amy recently gave me a wonderful gift. She cleaned up my office
[2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:55.020]  My office is a mess. I mean, it's like it's serious Andy Rooney situation, but I do have it's not a system
[2:07:55.020 --> 2:08:00.460]  I'm not and I'm not even saying it's a good idea, but I generally you know if I go a long time without cleaning up my office
[2:08:00.460 --> 2:08:02.460]  I have a vague idea of
[2:08:02.700 --> 2:08:05.420]  In which pile on which shelf something is
[2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:08.700]  Um, she cleaned it all up and and you know
[2:08:08.940 --> 2:08:10.140]  It's all organized and stuff
[2:08:10.140 --> 2:08:15.900]  But I don't know where that is so usually when I have to scan something I don't I don't know where an actual scanner is
[2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:18.780]  Um, and so I just take a picture with my phones
[2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:23.980]  Like I'll ask them. I'll say can I scan it and email to you and they'll say yes
[2:08:23.980 --> 2:08:27.500]  And I'll just take a picture with my phone and then crop out the table
[2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:32.460]  And just send them that and I've never once heard anything, you know
[2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:38.060]  And there are also there are lots of apps that will do a fancier job of that like they'll use they'll still use the phone camera
[2:08:38.220 --> 2:08:43.900]  But they'll be able to like detect where the page is and then like d skew it so it's properly, you know lined up and everything
[2:08:44.300 --> 2:08:49.660]  I know smile makes one. I think it's PDF scan plus. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, they make one
[2:08:49.660 --> 2:08:55.740]  There's a bunch of these on the app store, but I have theirs. I'm pretty sure I I honestly never use it because I have I have a
[2:08:55.900 --> 2:09:00.700]  Scansnap which is awesome, but but a lot of people use those apps on the phone. They're fine
[2:09:00.700 --> 2:09:03.580]  And you know for your scanning volume. It sounds like it's very low
[2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:08.060]  That's probably fine. This is extremely low very very low on the scanning point
[2:09:08.860 --> 2:09:10.220]  Um
[2:09:10.220 --> 2:09:12.220]  Anything else you want to say about peace
[2:09:12.860 --> 2:09:14.860]  No
[2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:23.660]  I'm glad it's over. I mean, it really does seem like it's over now. Like I really you know, I'm still getting like the the various like
[2:09:24.780 --> 2:09:27.340]  inquiries from media people
[2:09:28.300 --> 2:09:30.300]  I got a good one earlier
[2:09:31.260 --> 2:09:33.500]  This is a guy in Twitter asked me earlier
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:41.980]  Any chance you can join us for a webinar on ad blockers for the ad industry this coming Tuesday. I can DM you more details
[2:09:41.980 --> 2:09:43.980]  I
[2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:46.860]  Can't imagine a tweet that was
[2:09:48.220 --> 2:09:51.980]  Less well crafted to get my response than that
[2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:59.740]  Yeah, I I so I'm still getting a lot of these like media requests from people who want me to
[2:10:00.380 --> 2:10:06.300]  Go speak at their webinars to the ad industry about ads, but for the most part everything else has died down and
[2:10:06.300 --> 2:10:11.420]  It is I'm just so relieved and so now I'm back to working on overcast which is
[2:10:12.140 --> 2:10:13.340]  So much better
[2:10:13.340 --> 2:10:17.900]  Like as I said like it's probably not going to make anywhere near the right the amount of money that piece did
[2:10:17.900 --> 2:10:22.780]  But I don't care because it I would I'm so much happier working on it. It's no contest
[2:10:24.140 --> 2:10:27.260]  I thought that you really it seemed on your show
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:33.900]  And this wasn't even talking to you, but it just seemed listening to ATP that it really hit you hard personally like
[2:10:33.900 --> 2:10:39.340]  It you the thing that seemed to me to most upset you was the idea that
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:46.300]  That this thing that you built in two weeks, and I think you're probably right. I mean maybe on and off you've been thinking about it all summer
[2:10:46.300 --> 2:10:47.900]  but
[2:10:47.900 --> 2:10:51.820]  A really really low level of effort relative to everything else
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:10:56.060]  Was going to significantly out gross
[2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:03.820]  The app that you've been working on for years and thinking about for even
[2:11:03.820 --> 2:11:05.820]  longer
[2:11:05.820 --> 2:11:09.820]  And that you want to keep working on for years to come and that that seemed to really get to you
[2:11:10.380 --> 2:11:14.300]  Yeah, I mean and you know like it is really it is impossible to
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.260]  To understate
[2:11:17.500 --> 2:11:19.500]  How little code there is in peace
[2:11:19.820 --> 2:11:24.540]  Like people who asked me like a bunch of people in a bunch of the the younger responses were
[2:11:25.020 --> 2:11:30.620]  On the lines of the only responsible thing for you to do is to open source it since you abandoned it and
[2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:35.180]  First of all, I can't because it has ghostry data, which I don't have the rights to but
[2:11:36.060 --> 2:11:40.300]  But the actual application code that is not just the database of sites
[2:11:41.260 --> 2:11:48.140]  Is so tiny it there's almost no code there because Apple basically made this entire content blocking framework to be
[2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:51.900]  Really efficiently designed to create ad blockers
[2:11:52.860 --> 2:11:55.180]  And so that's why I assume from the beginning
[2:11:55.180 --> 2:12:02.140]  I assume that I assume that mine wouldn't get significant traction because I assume there would be tons of them on right on day one and
[2:12:02.380 --> 2:12:06.220]  And there were a handful but not nearly as many as I expected
[2:12:06.780 --> 2:12:09.900]  But yeah, but I did you know like the reality was that
[2:12:10.700 --> 2:12:15.180]  The the iOS ad blocker business is not a technical challenge at all
[2:12:15.980 --> 2:12:19.420]  It is I mean, I suppose if you've never made an app before
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:21.740]  It's as challenging as making any other kind of app
[2:12:21.740 --> 2:12:28.060]  But if you are if you are an experienced app developer, you can crap out a content blocker in a week or less
[2:12:28.540 --> 2:12:32.620]  You can do it in a couple days. I mean it it is so easy to do
[2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:40.300]  And it is therefore not intellectually stimulating. It's not satisfying really beyond you know the first couple days
[2:12:41.020 --> 2:12:43.580]  Then it's just grunt work and it's just keeping up the database
[2:12:43.580 --> 2:12:48.060]  Which is really boring and which is not programming and it's not intellectually
[2:12:48.060 --> 2:12:55.020]  Valuable so it is it does not stimulating if you desire that kind of intellectual satisfaction. So
[2:12:56.380 --> 2:12:58.380]  whereas overcast is
[2:12:58.540 --> 2:13:00.540]  full of
[2:13:00.700 --> 2:13:02.140]  really satisfying
[2:13:02.140 --> 2:13:08.380]  complex technical problems that require my brain to be really working at its best to solve properly and
[2:13:09.020 --> 2:13:11.580]  That is incredibly satisfying to me and
[2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:15.420]  And I would I would much rather work on that
[2:13:15.420 --> 2:13:20.300]  Do you have the number? Do you know how many ATP listeners listen to via overcast?
[2:13:21.500 --> 2:13:26.220]  I don't I don't have it. It's something like 60% it's in it's in that ballpark
[2:13:27.100 --> 2:13:33.260]  Yeah, I think it's very close to that for me because I do get those numbers from soundcloud where I host
[2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:36.060]  the audio
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:43.100]  Let's see how I always forget how to help it click around and get it though. Oh, yeah overcast number one
[2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:46.940]  Yeah, even more and second place is
[2:13:48.860 --> 2:13:51.180]  Apple core media iPhone which like
[2:13:51.820 --> 2:13:54.940]  99% sure translates to the built-in podcast app
[2:13:55.740 --> 2:13:58.460]  Yeah, it's also it also includes like anything with AV player
[2:13:58.540 --> 2:14:01.740]  So like if you if you if you're playing a web page in bed
[2:14:02.780 --> 2:14:06.620]  Or certain podcast apps actually report themselves as that
[2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:11.500]  Just because they don't change it or they can't reach that that part of the API with the level they're playing at
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:13.900]  So there some will be included in there
[2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:20.620]  Yeah, for me, it's a little it's a right around 50% so it's not quite 60% but no no surprise that
[2:14:22.460 --> 2:14:25.340]  That it's more like 60 for you since you wrote the thing
[2:14:26.220 --> 2:14:29.900]  But it's always double checked. It's actually I'm about 50. Yeah, that's right
[2:14:30.700 --> 2:14:32.700]  49.92 on
[2:14:33.100 --> 2:14:36.500]  Three episodes ago because I figured that like you know that gives people a time to actually download it
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:45.140]  So yeah, I'm up there actually let me change it to a month and see if that changes anything
[2:14:46.500 --> 2:14:49.060]  Yeah, actually it's even more actually if I look
[2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:54.740]  Bigger it's actually more. Yeah, it's because I haven't had an episode in the last seven days
[2:14:54.900 --> 2:15:00.100]  So if you count the whole month which gets to all the people who listen right away and you know
[2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:02.420]  I think I think it
[2:15:02.420 --> 2:15:07.460]  Undersamples the people of the last seven days because the biggest fans of the show listen when they're new and so in the last seven days
[2:15:07.460 --> 2:15:12.420]  There haven't been any so really really overwhelmingly number one for for my listeners
[2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:14.660]  And if anybody out there has been curious about it
[2:15:14.660 --> 2:15:19.060]  I really do recommend it not just because Mark goes on the show today, but it's my favorite app for listening to podcast
[2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:20.900]  I'm really good at promotion
[2:15:20.900 --> 2:15:24.500]  So here I am talking about the app that I just pulled off the store for two hours
[2:15:25.060 --> 2:15:28.820]  And meanwhile, I'm gonna ship overcast 2.0 like pretty soon
[2:15:28.820 --> 2:15:34.100]  And I'm not gonna be right back on to talk about that in like three weeks or whatever
[2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:37.460]  No, I'm really not good at this promotion. Yeah, you're not good at it at all
[2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:43.860]  The big-no feature in overcast 2.0 is the streaming engine. Yeah, which is
[2:15:46.180 --> 2:15:50.820]  In addition to just letting you listen to stuff right away and set it down load the whole episode
[2:15:52.180 --> 2:15:56.340]  It's really more of like a just play just it's like a just play interface
[2:15:56.340 --> 2:15:59.860]  So whether you care about stream if you think you care about streaming podcasts or not
[2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:03.140]  If you've ever been frustrated because you want to just start playing something
[2:16:03.140 --> 2:16:06.180]  But your phone's been asleep or whatever and it didn't download in the background
[2:16:06.340 --> 2:16:09.780]  Or it just you just got the alert that the new episode of hello internet is out
[2:16:09.780 --> 2:16:10.980]  And you want to listen to it right away
[2:16:11.220 --> 2:16:14.260]  It just means that you hit the play button and it'll just start playing
[2:16:14.980 --> 2:16:19.060]  That's I mean so many people like when I when I was talking you know a year ago
[2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:21.460]  About how streaming was gonna be a big deal
[2:16:21.620 --> 2:16:25.140]  I didn't even include it in a 1.0 because I knew that not everybody would need it
[2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:27.140]  I heard from so many people who said
[2:16:27.540 --> 2:16:33.300]  Please don't work on that please do other things because I don't care about streaming and granted
[2:16:33.300 --> 2:16:38.340]  I heard from way more people who said I won't use this until it has streaming which was you know
[2:16:38.500 --> 2:16:40.500]  Of the more common
[2:16:40.740 --> 2:16:45.460]  Emotion by far, but a lot of people just keep saying I don't need it. I will never use it
[2:16:45.460 --> 2:16:49.700]  But the reality is it is really nice to have for those times when you know
[2:16:50.100 --> 2:16:52.500]  What you said an episode just came out or just came in
[2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:55.540]  You just got you just synced it and you want to start listening to it right now
[2:16:56.260 --> 2:17:02.580]  And podcasts can be you know 50 100 megs and not every CDN is fast and not every connection that you might have is fast
[2:17:02.580 --> 2:17:07.300]  And so a lot of times you know if you if you have to wait for the whole podcast to download
[2:17:07.860 --> 2:17:11.700]  You know it might take 10 20 seconds or it might take five or 10 minutes
[2:17:12.100 --> 2:17:12.980]  No matter what it takes
[2:17:12.980 --> 2:17:17.060]  It feels like an eternity as you're sitting there watching this stupid down thing 1%
[2:17:17.460 --> 2:17:18.980]  2% and you're like oh my god
[2:17:18.980 --> 2:17:20.980]  I just want to listen to it now
[2:17:20.980 --> 2:17:24.420]  And so like streaming really makes everything a little bit better
[2:17:24.420 --> 2:17:28.340]  And it it enables a bunch of other little stuff like it enables me to
[2:17:29.060 --> 2:17:34.260]  Although I haven't done this yet to put put a play button on the notifications for new episodes
[2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:36.740]  So you can just start playing them immediately like stuff like that
[2:17:36.740 --> 2:17:42.180]  Just like there's so many new little things that it makes possible and so many old things that it makes better
[2:17:42.180 --> 2:17:45.620]  Because right now with streaming now you can just as long as you are connected somehow
[2:17:46.100 --> 2:17:50.180]  You can tap on any episode in any list whether you have it or not
[2:17:50.180 --> 2:17:56.260]  And it started it just starts playing yeah, and it's one of those things were again the absoluteest position
[2:17:57.060 --> 2:17:58.980]  It just doesn't work in software design
[2:17:58.980 --> 2:18:01.380]  Or if you want to say no settings whatsoever
[2:18:01.620 --> 2:18:05.860]  The app I'm gonna make all the choices for the user and do them right way or you could say
[2:18:05.940 --> 2:18:11.140]  Everything should be configurable and and the users should be able to configure everything well both of those extremes are
[2:18:11.940 --> 2:18:14.340]  absurd and if you think you're sticking to them
[2:18:14.340 --> 2:18:16.500]  You're fooling yourself the right way to think about it
[2:18:16.500 --> 2:18:20.500]  Is you do have kind of have to pick which side of the 50 yard line you're gonna be on though
[2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:27.380]  Are you gonna make this sort of app where you're going to default to not offering options and configurability
[2:18:28.580 --> 2:18:32.340]  And maybe you know you'll wind up not having enough options
[2:18:32.500 --> 2:18:36.260]  Or are you gonna default to saying yes to most things and having
[2:18:37.300 --> 2:18:43.300]  Options for things and you know you're gonna wind up with a complex number of settings and and
[2:18:43.300 --> 2:18:46.580]  You know one way or the other you're gonna you're gonna disappoint some users
[2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:50.580]  I clearly
[2:18:50.580 --> 2:18:55.620]  You mark a arm and air on the side of not offering too many options in the stuff that you built
[2:18:55.620 --> 2:18:57.620]  I mean and and peace was a
[2:18:57.620 --> 2:18:59.620]  canonical example of that
[2:19:00.100 --> 2:19:05.700]  But you have to you've talked about this on ATP there have to be some settings for streaming because it's
[2:19:06.340 --> 2:19:10.180]  Different people have it around the world even maybe even within the country
[2:19:10.180 --> 2:19:16.980]  Even just in the United States have incredibly different situations with and tolerance levels for
[2:19:18.180 --> 2:19:22.900]  Data charges, right? There's people who are living in countries where you you know
[2:19:22.900 --> 2:19:24.900]  They're they're online database
[2:19:24.900 --> 2:19:34.580]  You know their online data is still measured in megabytes not gigabytes or people who are traveling internationally and are on an international
[2:19:34.580 --> 2:19:39.300]  Data plan and you're measured in megabytes not gigabytes what you know if you're on a 25 megabyte
[2:19:39.300 --> 2:19:44.900]  Data plan you cannot download an episode of the talk show over cellular
[2:19:45.860 --> 2:19:47.540]  Unless you want to pay over its charges
[2:19:47.780 --> 2:19:52.660]  But then there's plenty of other people who have unlimited data or virtually unlimited data
[2:19:52.820 --> 2:19:59.700]  You know with you know 15 or 20 gigabytes a month and 150 megabyte podcast is no big deal and they want to download it there
[2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:01.700]  So there have to be settings
[2:20:01.700 --> 2:20:04.420]  I mean the funny thing is like going back to our earlier conversation
[2:20:04.980 --> 2:20:08.660]  I really sweat a lot of the details around this stuff to try to minimize data transfer
[2:20:08.660 --> 2:20:13.220]  Meanwhile, you view a couple of web pages on a big site
[2:20:13.780 --> 2:20:15.780]  And that's as much as a podcast episode
[2:20:16.580 --> 2:20:18.580]  it is it
[2:20:19.140 --> 2:20:21.460]  Some of the the fact that people are measuring these things now
[2:20:21.460 --> 2:20:25.940]  I've always known that things are big and that some sites are obviously serving too much
[2:20:26.020 --> 2:20:29.860]  You know data or or a ridiculous amount compared to the what you know
[2:20:30.180 --> 2:20:33.780]  Something if it's an article. I just want to read it should not be measured in megabytes
[2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:38.180]  But now that people are actually measuring it while they test these content blockers
[2:20:38.180 --> 2:20:40.180]  It is like holy crap no wonder
[2:20:40.820 --> 2:20:48.100]  When I was in Ireland for all that I mowed through my 100 megabyte data plan while I thought I was being
[2:20:50.900 --> 2:20:54.180]  You know conservative with how much I used my phone
[2:20:55.380 --> 2:20:56.660]  I thought that you know, hey
[2:20:56.660 --> 2:21:00.180]  I'm just I'll just read a couple of articles on tech meme and see if there's anything new going on
[2:21:00.180 --> 2:21:04.340]  Well, no wonder I hate through a hundred megabytes. It's like one page on the verge load seven megabytes
[2:21:04.740 --> 2:21:07.780]  Right. Yeah, like you see all these all these networks reports not like pages
[2:21:08.260 --> 2:21:14.900]  Seven mags nine mags 30 mags on the bus and that comment that is like some create and it's like a podcast episode is like
[2:21:15.380 --> 2:21:17.380]  30 to 50 mags usually
[2:21:17.380 --> 2:21:19.380]  They're not like like that's that's
[2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:24.900]  Eight ten web pages maybe I think it's not that's really scary. It's really scary and really sad
[2:21:25.780 --> 2:21:27.940]  But anyway, yeah, so with streaming. I yeah, I don't know
[2:21:27.940 --> 2:21:31.460]  I've actually offered I'm offering very few options on
[2:21:31.940 --> 2:21:35.460]  2.0. We'll see how that plays out. You know, you're like a you know, you can't you know
[2:21:35.460 --> 2:21:37.940]  The absolute positions never work. There's always going to be
[2:21:39.140 --> 2:21:44.340]  Realities and also market pressures that set in that you know, so I'm trying to have as few settings as possible
[2:21:45.140 --> 2:21:47.140]  To still make it good
[2:21:47.140 --> 2:21:52.980]  But of course everyone's trying that and everyone again draws that line of different places. Yeah, I think the biggest thing is to try to avoid
[2:21:53.620 --> 2:21:55.620]  surprise
[2:21:55.620 --> 2:22:00.500]  Yeah, like my theory like right now with the way it works right now way. Okay. It's probably the way it's going to ship is
[2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:03.620]  If you choose to stream something
[2:22:03.780 --> 2:22:08.900]  It will always allow it to use cellular in that case and the rationale there is
[2:22:09.620 --> 2:22:12.820]  That well, that's how everything else works. You know if you load a web page
[2:22:13.460 --> 2:22:16.580]  It doesn't ask it doesn't say waiting for Wi-Fi. You know
[2:22:16.660 --> 2:22:18.900]  It just if you click on a link to load a web page
[2:22:19.460 --> 2:22:23.140]  It just loads it by whatever connection has available and if you want to restrict apps
[2:22:23.140 --> 2:22:27.380]  It's not you cellular you can do that globally in settings. You can say per app
[2:22:27.540 --> 2:22:32.100]  You can go to overcast in the system settings app and you can say just never allow this app to use any cellular data
[2:22:32.180 --> 2:22:34.340]  Like that's a switch right there. You can do it a lot of people do
[2:22:35.140 --> 2:22:41.300]  And so all I have to do is I don't have to cover the case of people who want the app to use no cell data
[2:22:41.620 --> 2:22:47.700]  Because the system covers that I have to cover the case of people who want to use it sometimes
[2:22:48.580 --> 2:22:51.620]  Or or want to use it always and so
[2:22:51.620 --> 2:22:54.580]  The way everything else works web pages
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:22:59.540]  More importantly stuff like YouTube like if you you know YouTube is obviously massive
[2:23:00.340 --> 2:23:06.100]  That is the entire internet to people like your son and lots of other people in the world. That's that's a big deal
[2:23:07.620 --> 2:23:11.220]  You know YouTube if you are on cellular data and you
[2:23:11.460 --> 2:23:15.380]  Longed the YouTube thing and go view of YouTube video. It just plays it
[2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:18.260]  It streams it and it plays it oversell data and it's fine
[2:23:18.260 --> 2:23:22.020]  If you go play a song these days, you're probably playing it off cell data
[2:23:22.020 --> 2:23:30.580]  You know most that's how much people listening to songs like so the idea of like having to like prompt the user or make a lot of granular
[2:23:30.580 --> 2:23:33.620]  Settings for when do you sell data I think is outdated
[2:23:34.260 --> 2:23:38.340]  And so now I think I can get away with the current options that I have which is
[2:23:39.700 --> 2:23:45.460]  Literally it just it always allows cell data on streaming because you initiated that like you the user said play this now
[2:23:45.460 --> 2:23:51.860]  And so in my opinion then you don't have to ask are you sure you want to play it over cell data because you're currently on this on
[2:23:51.860 --> 2:23:55.780]  I work no these days, you know, what year is this you play it now and then
[2:23:56.420 --> 2:23:58.420]  The only option I have is whether
[2:23:58.980 --> 2:24:02.020]  Automatic background downloads should use cellular
[2:24:02.980 --> 2:24:07.700]  And it's default to off the so the augmented background downloads will default to Wi-Fi only
[2:24:08.340 --> 2:24:12.820]  Because in that case, it's like well you didn't initiate this this came in outside of your control
[2:24:12.820 --> 2:24:15.220]  You know, it could have come in the middle of the night you when you were asleep
[2:24:16.020 --> 2:24:19.700]  And your iPad downloaded an entire episode of madman and burned through your whole vart for eyes and cap
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:21.780]  You know that that could have happened so
[2:24:22.420 --> 2:24:26.020]  You know that that is a preference to me that is like okay
[2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:34.580]  Do you have so much data that you always want this the the app to use much of it as it needs to or do you want to
[2:24:35.380 --> 2:24:38.340]  Basically use it on demand. Yeah, that seems about right. That seems right
[2:24:38.340 --> 2:24:42.740]  Let the automatic stuff stay on Wi-Fi and let the user initiate its stuff play
[2:24:43.300 --> 2:24:47.380]  Yeah, and however, you know, you're never going to win somebody's going to complain, but
[2:24:48.820 --> 2:24:50.820]  I think in general, it's actually
[2:24:51.460 --> 2:24:56.580]  Your logic is completely correct that if the user hits play and they have a working network connection
[2:24:56.660 --> 2:25:00.500]  They mean play right because that's how you know podcast apps
[2:25:00.980 --> 2:25:03.940]  Historically have not worked that way always like they've offered more granular control
[2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:08.020]  But I'm not see I'm not looking at what other podcast apps are doing to solve this problem
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:12.420]  I'm looking at what other apps are doing not pocket like just what what people expect
[2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:16.340]  Based on the reality of other apps that exist in the universe today and
[2:25:17.060 --> 2:25:22.260]  What that is these days is a lot of streaming media and it and it just uses cellular when it needs to and it doesn't ask you
[2:25:22.500 --> 2:25:28.580]  Yeah, I think part of it too is that things have changed so quickly in so few years and that streaming in general has just become
[2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:35.860]  It's a huge phenomenon, but podcasting started back. I mean the name even says, you know
[2:25:35.860 --> 2:25:41.460]  It's the iPad I pod, you know, that's the podcasting from a time when you downloaded stuff first
[2:25:42.180 --> 2:25:44.180]  And it's a very bright
[2:25:44.180 --> 2:25:52.180]  USB and that it was a big deal and they podcast episodes were things you had to wait for while they downloaded because they were big
[2:25:52.980 --> 2:25:58.260]  Whereas, you know, it's they're not that big anymore and you know most people a lot an awful lot of people have
[2:25:58.260 --> 2:26:04.020]  Cellular network connections that handle it easily because they can handle video if they can handle video you can handle audio easily
[2:26:04.340 --> 2:26:05.780]  Exactly, you know, so and you know
[2:26:05.780 --> 2:26:10.420]  There was there's also like there's other implementation details that that were tricky problems like one of them is
[2:26:11.060 --> 2:26:13.060]  If you're on cellular
[2:26:13.060 --> 2:26:16.740]  How much should the streamer read ahead of the file?
[2:26:17.140 --> 2:26:19.700]  Like should it should it just keep downloading till it has the whole thing
[2:26:20.260 --> 2:26:25.860]  Or should it only buffer ahead like five minutes worth at a time, you know and and so on and
[2:26:25.860 --> 2:26:28.180]  The decision I came to on that is
[2:26:28.820 --> 2:26:34.820]  It should just download as much as it can whenever it feels like it, you know, so so if you if you start an episode playing over cellular
[2:26:35.860 --> 2:26:41.540]  You know, in streaming it will download as much as it can until the connection drops or until it finishes the file
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:45.780]  That's it because any other solution that I thought of and tried
[2:26:46.740 --> 2:26:52.740]  would fail in other ways like it would it would be inconvenient or annoying or it wouldn't be what I wanted in other situations and
[2:26:52.740 --> 2:26:55.700]  And the fact is an entire podcast episode, you know
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:00.100]  Most people who listen to podcasts aren't listening to shows like this that are two hours long
[2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:04.660]  most people are listening to stuff like, you know public radio shows that are maybe
[2:27:05.060 --> 2:27:06.580]  20 30 minutes
[2:27:06.580 --> 2:27:12.260]  And so those are like 15 megs 20 megs like they they were really small files and again
[2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:14.260]  That's like two verge articles
[2:27:15.060 --> 2:27:18.020]  So it's no big deal to buffer ahead. Whereas it is a big deal if
[2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:23.780]  If somebody is driving on a long highway trip and they're counting on streaming to play their their podcasts for them
[2:27:24.180 --> 2:27:27.540]  And they lose reception for a few minutes because they're in the middle of the mountains
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:33.620]  And the show that they were downloading just drops because it didn't buffer ahead enough and it could have it had the connection back there
[2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:37.780]  It could have it could have downloaded the whole show had plenty of time to download it and then just didn't you know
[2:27:37.780 --> 2:27:42.020]  So there's situations like that or you know more commonly like if you're on a metro system
[2:27:42.020 --> 2:27:49.060]  That's underground and stuff like that. So it's it was just better again another decision that if I was making that decision
[2:27:49.300 --> 2:27:52.740]  Five years ago 10 years ago. I would have probably made it differently, but you know now
[2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:58.260]  This is this is the era where things stream and it's not a big deal
[2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:03.860]  And if you need to really restrict the amount of data that you use you have to consciously
[2:28:04.660 --> 2:28:10.260]  Download media for offline use and then like, you know and avoid actively streaming things or
[2:28:10.260 --> 2:28:12.820]  Go into the system settings app and turn off cellular for all these apps
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:16.500]  I think you're on the right track. I think it's gonna be a big hit
[2:28:17.220 --> 2:28:24.100]  Let me take one last break here and hit the money button once again and thank our our fourth and final sponsor long time friends of the show
[2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:30.020]  Long time friends of ATP as well igloo. Oh, yeah igloo software.com
[2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:33.460]  Slash the talk show or
[2:28:33.460 --> 2:28:39.220]  Slash what's what you know what your code is offhand. I believe that would just ATP ATP you can probably figure it out
[2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:47.380]  igloo is the intranet intra net that you will actually like. I love that slogan
[2:28:48.180 --> 2:28:54.340]  That lets you share news organize your files coordinate calendars manage projects set up a little micro blog
[2:28:54.660 --> 2:28:57.460]  Think of that as like a little internal like a private Twitter
[2:28:57.540 --> 2:29:00.660]  Imagine if you had like a little Twitter for your team that you could use
[2:29:00.660 --> 2:29:04.900]  Just for internal stuff. They can't go public can't be shared publicly
[2:29:06.100 --> 2:29:11.620]  igloo has that sort of feature built right in their latest upgrade. They call it Viking. I guess it's like a codename
[2:29:13.060 --> 2:29:20.020]  The big push they had this summer for Viking was all around documents and how you and your team interact with them gather feedback
[2:29:20.180 --> 2:29:25.140]  Make changes in a lot of businesses good old-fashioned documents real files
[2:29:25.460 --> 2:29:29.140]  That you have to share with each other not just things that live online as you are else
[2:29:29.140 --> 2:29:33.060]  The real files still big part of the business big part of the real world
[2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:37.540]  So they've really really up their game on that sort of stuff and they've added
[2:29:38.420 --> 2:29:40.340]  The equivalent of read receipts in the email
[2:29:41.060 --> 2:29:43.380]  So you know when somebody's seen it now. It doesn't go on by default
[2:29:43.380 --> 2:29:46.660]  You turn it's just like a read receipt email don't ask for it unless you need it
[2:29:46.660 --> 2:29:50.660]  But you turn it on and if it's an important thing some kind of thing that you have to get sign offs on
[2:29:51.380 --> 2:29:55.940]  Put that on share it then you can see that everybody who needs to see it has seen it
[2:29:55.940 --> 2:30:01.220]  Really really important for certain legal agreements and in certain cases if you don't need it
[2:30:01.220 --> 2:30:03.220]  You don't have to worry about it, but if you do need it
[2:30:03.940 --> 2:30:05.940]  igloo is
[2:30:05.940 --> 2:30:09.460]  Can be part of your game now when it couldn't before big big part of their push
[2:30:09.940 --> 2:30:15.460]  If your company has a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 90s
[2:30:15.860 --> 2:30:17.860]  That's because it probably was
[2:30:18.740 --> 2:30:24.180]  It's very very true. You should give igloo a try. Here's the thing that's the most amazing about igloo
[2:30:24.180 --> 2:30:29.380]  I keep waiting for this to end and it hasn't ended is if for up to 10 users
[2:30:29.540 --> 2:30:32.420]  You can use igloo for free. You just use it
[2:30:32.420 --> 2:30:37.220]  So if you're on a really small team or if you have a really small company that's under 10 employees igloo is just free
[2:30:37.220 --> 2:30:39.220]  It's free not for a month. It's just free
[2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:45.860]  If you have more than 10 people you can try it out right now for free at igloo software
[2:30:46.260 --> 2:30:50.420]  Dot-com slash the talk show try it out for free with up to 10 of your colleagues
[2:30:50.420 --> 2:30:54.740]  Just to see that it works get it set up configure it the way you want it to work
[2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:57.940]  Test it out and until you're satisfied with it
[2:30:57.940 --> 2:31:04.340]  You don't have to pay for anything and then when you are satisfied you go and they have very very low prices for per user over 10
[2:31:05.220 --> 2:31:07.460]  But that's the way they work free for up to 10
[2:31:08.340 --> 2:31:11.380]  Over 10 you pay a very very reasonable very competitive
[2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:14.420]  number of dollars per user
[2:31:15.460 --> 2:31:19.060]  So go check them out long-time friends of this show people keep writing to me
[2:31:19.060 --> 2:31:24.340]  I get a lot of email from people saying they signed up for igloo very very happy with it good software
[2:31:27.220 --> 2:31:30.340]  Those guys now have to spend their ad money, you know, they started when they started years ago
[2:31:30.340 --> 2:31:36.020]  They they got sandwich to make videos for them. Yeah, they were they were really they've been progressive right from the start
[2:31:36.260 --> 2:31:40.180]  Yeah, they did like a TV commercials with the sandwich
[2:31:40.900 --> 2:31:42.260]  Good stuff
[2:31:42.260 --> 2:31:44.980]  I don't have much time. We've been going on forever. We always go long
[2:31:44.980 --> 2:31:50.260]  I don't we haven't gone on too terribly long, but we don't have a lot of time left. I guess we can just briefly
[2:31:52.260 --> 2:31:54.260]  Briefly talk about
[2:31:55.380 --> 2:31:58.260]  The the new iPhone because now you've got one
[2:31:59.140 --> 2:32:01.700]  Yeah, we got two in the house. No. Yeah, we both got him
[2:32:02.420 --> 2:32:04.420]  So what did you guys get?
[2:32:04.420 --> 2:32:05.620]  success
[2:32:05.620 --> 2:32:08.020]  She got going up black, you know, usual
[2:32:08.980 --> 2:32:13.140]  And no no pluses. No, and we went 16 gigs for you
[2:32:13.140 --> 2:32:15.140]  I
[2:32:17.460 --> 2:32:25.140]  Think you guys have been more more critical of the 16 gig than then I have you're you're you are more convinced that it's an upsell
[2:32:25.700 --> 2:32:33.620]  Product mark or what's it would you call it marketing? I don't know that that it's it's it's it's not that they want to make higher margins on the 16 gigabyte
[2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:38.580]  phones it's that they want to make higher margins because there's enough people out there who
[2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:44.260]  Would if they if the bottom line was 32 instead of 16 they would buy that 32
[2:32:44.660 --> 2:32:46.660]  But they know that 16 isn't enough
[2:32:46.980 --> 2:32:50.980]  So they just bite the bullet and buy 64 and that's an entire hundred dollar
[2:32:51.700 --> 2:32:57.140]  Extra hundred dollars in revenue and probably close to a hundred dollars in you know in margin
[2:32:58.020 --> 2:33:00.660]  Correct. I mean, you know, you can look at something as you know
[2:33:00.660 --> 2:33:05.060]  Well, there's there's lots of justifications for this you can look at it
[2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:08.980]  You know, there's there's reasons like, you know, like what like when Phil Schiller was on here and he explained
[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:11.540]  You know, it's a lot of justifications for why this works
[2:33:11.940 --> 2:33:14.260]  There's also you know, I heard from a lot of people when I we're talking with us
[2:33:14.260 --> 2:33:17.780]  I heard from people who are saying well, you know, this is for we buy these for business
[2:33:17.940 --> 2:33:22.980]  We buy, you know, thousands of these for our employees or whatever and we don't need them to have more space
[2:33:23.620 --> 2:33:26.660]  Which I think is a terrible argument and you couldn't you know, you can apply that same thing
[2:33:26.660 --> 2:33:31.860]  Well, like do they need cameras? Do they need like a headphone jack like you know, you know, you can apply that to lots of things
[2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:36.660]  Um, so there's a lot of bad justifications for it, but I think
[2:33:38.340 --> 2:33:44.740]  Separating justifications from reasons is important and I think the main reason for it is you're right
[2:33:44.740 --> 2:33:50.020]  It is not it is not necessarily to make the extra couple of dollars of margin on the 16 gig model
[2:33:50.340 --> 2:33:58.180]  It's that they are selling so many more of the 64's that it is most likely having a significant boost on the average selling price
[2:33:58.180 --> 2:34:04.500]  and when you're talking about the most profitable product of the most profitable company like
[2:34:05.380 --> 2:34:10.340]  A significant boost to the average selling price of their best selling product is
[2:34:11.140 --> 2:34:17.620]  Massively important like that is a big deal to them and they don't always do what's a hundred percent best for the customer
[2:34:17.620 --> 2:34:22.420]  It's always a balancing act, you know, it's it's you know, they they they will they're happy to charge
[2:34:22.420 --> 2:34:29.540]  $45 for a you know, a letter case that they could sell for a lot less, you know, stuff like that like you know
[2:34:29.540 --> 2:34:31.220]  They they're not totally
[2:34:31.220 --> 2:34:38.500]  A charity here like they're doing stuff as a balance between satisfaction and profit and I think this is one of those things where in my opinion
[2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:41.860]  They've chosen wrong. I think they have not balanced this correctly in this case
[2:34:42.500 --> 2:34:45.380]  that I think the the long-term costs to
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:34:48.100]  Satisfaction and to
[2:34:48.580 --> 2:34:50.580]  the the load it places on
[2:34:50.580 --> 2:34:52.740]  Support on the genius bar
[2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:59.780]  The the problems people face with their full phones and trying to manage storage themselves, you know
[2:34:59.780 --> 2:35:02.980]  I think all these things are are a poor balance of
[2:35:03.780 --> 2:35:05.780]  of utility versus
[2:35:06.420 --> 2:35:10.100]  versus profit and I would say the same thing about you know other things like the
[2:35:11.220 --> 2:35:17.620]  The iCloud storage to your pricing, you know, they just got better, but it's still not great like I you know
[2:35:17.620 --> 2:35:21.460]  There's problems there's you can point to all sorts of things like this with Apple and
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:24.180]  Most of the stuff they do is a pretty good value
[2:35:24.580 --> 2:35:28.980]  But but there's there's these little edges like this where you can just kind of tell. Oh, yeah
[2:35:28.980 --> 2:35:33.620]  This is they just did this because this would be a massive difference in profit
[2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:36.980]  Yeah, and I it's weird
[2:35:36.980 --> 2:35:39.540]  I can't help it. I think it has to change next year
[2:35:39.860 --> 2:35:44.180]  Although who knows, you know, I mean like I keep thinking well next year when I go to the seven
[2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:48.820]  I'll have to up the minimum to the 32 and the OS isn't going to get bigger
[2:35:48.900 --> 2:35:51.860]  So it'll just mean that there's a lot more free space for everybody
[2:35:52.500 --> 2:35:53.300]  Um
[2:35:53.300 --> 2:35:57.780]  And then I think to myself, I don't know if I'd want to bet on that because maybe you know
[2:35:58.980 --> 2:36:02.100]  They've had the thing that I keep thinking about is if they did it again
[2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:07.380]  Going from the six to the success with the exact same split and they change so much other stuff
[2:36:07.380 --> 2:36:14.100]  They change the actual aluminum alloy they make the things out of so it's not like they're afraid to change stuff in our net
[2:36:14.100 --> 2:36:17.460]  It also seems like they changed the flash everyone's saying it's much faster
[2:36:18.100 --> 2:36:23.140]  Yeah, and and whether that's because it's the component or it's at least the
[2:36:24.580 --> 2:36:32.580]  Uh like was it ours technica? I think that had the specs and wrote some code. It's that the the storage controller is new
[2:36:33.380 --> 2:36:34.340]  uh
[2:36:34.340 --> 2:36:37.380]  And is now more like uh
[2:36:37.380 --> 2:36:42.180]  You know, it's effectively like a MacBook storage controller. So it's it's a serious upgrade
[2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:48.100]  It is in addition to like the CPU and GPU benchmarks being equivalent to the the MacBook one
[2:36:48.740 --> 2:36:49.940]  Um
[2:36:49.940 --> 2:36:56.740]  It really seems like they've up their storage performance and the way they treat storage to to laptop
[2:36:56.740 --> 2:37:01.380]  You know MacBook quality engineering which is again, it's a crazy big change
[2:37:01.380 --> 2:37:06.500]  This whole notion that the S ones are just minor revisions. It's really really crazy
[2:37:07.220 --> 2:37:10.900]  Um, I think if anything in my review. I think I undersold this
[2:37:11.620 --> 2:37:16.260]  This new theory I have which is that it takes Johnny Ives team two years
[2:37:16.500 --> 2:37:20.500]  I think I've got this boiled down to a good nut that it takes them two years to come up with it
[2:37:20.500 --> 2:37:25.380]  What they think is a superior design as in this is what it looks like
[2:37:25.940 --> 2:37:30.500]  This is the basic gist of the you know, it's gonna have this these size screens
[2:37:30.500 --> 2:37:35.940]  With this pixel resolution and there's gonna be a button down here that you that that'll be a
[2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:38.820]  Finger nail, you know a fingerprint sensor
[2:37:39.700 --> 2:37:41.620]  These are the buttons these are the sizes
[2:37:42.420 --> 2:37:46.100]  And then it you know somebody you know the engineering teams have to decide well
[2:37:46.100 --> 2:37:52.660]  How do we make this and because it takes two years for these new designs to come out and because two years is a good pace for them
[2:37:53.060 --> 2:37:56.420]  For new designs any for product marketing reasons anyway
[2:37:56.420 --> 2:38:04.740]  It means that the engineering teams get two cracks at it. They get the first crack which is how can we make this you know to hit this ship date?
[2:38:05.460 --> 2:38:06.500]  and
[2:38:06.500 --> 2:38:10.980]  You know and then they get a second on an entire year after that to
[2:38:11.460 --> 2:38:12.580]  Okay, how can we do it?
[2:38:12.580 --> 2:38:16.100]  How can we make that design even better and in terms of you know
[2:38:16.100 --> 2:38:21.540]  They rethink everything every single thing you touch on this iPhone is a different material than then last years
[2:38:21.540 --> 2:38:24.740]  I mean, maybe the rubber gaskets that cover the antennas are the
[2:38:24.740 --> 2:38:28.740]  Are the same material, but it's a new aluminum and it's a new glass
[2:38:29.540 --> 2:38:35.540]  So if they wanted to change the minimum to 32 they could have done it and I just keep thinking about the fact that if if the
[2:38:36.100 --> 2:38:37.860]  customer satisfaction
[2:38:37.860 --> 2:38:41.300]  Downsides to the 16 gig minimum whereas
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:45.460]  Significant enough to to worry them. They would have changed it
[2:38:46.420 --> 2:38:48.420]  That they could have seen those numbers
[2:38:48.660 --> 2:38:52.260]  last year early on and known that we've got you know
[2:38:52.260 --> 2:38:56.020]  That's that's a thing that I think that they could have changed say between
[2:38:56.660 --> 2:39:03.220]  last December and this September and I think a lot of it is locked down a year in advance, but they could have changed the minimum
[2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:09.380]  I do worry a little bit, you know, we've seen I think I think in the Tim Cook era of Apple
[2:39:09.940 --> 2:39:14.740]  I think it's safe to say based on our observations from the outside and some other statements
[2:39:14.740 --> 2:39:19.620]  I think it's probably safe to assume that they are more data-driven than they used to be like with Steve
[2:39:19.620 --> 2:39:23.540]  It would like you know, it was very much still based on Steve's intuitions
[2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:28.580]  Yeah, to a lot of degree right and and you know Tim is very much is much more data-driven
[2:39:28.740 --> 2:39:31.220]  And so that that's showing in the rest of the company and I worry
[2:39:31.700 --> 2:39:36.180]  One of the things that came up from various Apple people that I spoke with
[2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:42.580]  Or that I heard from one of the things that came up during the the functional high ground thing is that
[2:39:44.420 --> 2:39:46.740]  About half of Apple was like oh my god
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:51.060]  Thank you for finally saying this. I've been trying to convince higher-ups for years that we need to slow down and fix things
[2:39:51.700 --> 2:39:53.620]  and and the other part I heard was that
[2:39:54.740 --> 2:39:57.620]  A lot of this was catching higher-ups by surprise
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:40:04.100]  Yeah, that that they thought they were doing better than what I thought and that would a lot of other people thought and
[2:40:04.980 --> 2:40:09.460]  And there this is very much a metric-driven company. I would go even further than that and I
[2:40:09.460 --> 2:40:15.940]  I've what I heard wasn't just that that side of the company thought they were doing better than what you and others
[2:40:16.580 --> 2:40:21.620]  And they yeah, I hear you. That's right. They they honestly and truly believe
[2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:27.940]  Believed and maybe still continually believe that they're doing better on software quality than ever before in the company's history
[2:40:28.180 --> 2:40:31.860]  Not just that they were doing okay that they were doing better than ever
[2:40:32.660 --> 2:40:38.580]  Right and so my concern is twofold first of all the fact that that there's a massive
[2:40:38.580 --> 2:40:42.340]  Disconnective opinion there what it regards of which side is right?
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:46.020]  That shows a problem somewhere online that that should be considered, but
[2:40:46.820 --> 2:40:53.940]  My main concern is that we we can see definitely that they are way more metric-driven and numbers driven than they have been before
[2:40:54.580 --> 2:41:02.340]  That you know that is the new culture of Apple, you know in the Timkook era. That's and and it hit the Timkook era has brought a lot of
[2:41:02.340 --> 2:41:10.340]  positives and this is one that I think is is certainly positive in some areas, but it also has risks that they have to look out for
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:13.380]  And I'm not sure they found our imbalance yet one of the biggest risks is
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:16.100]  You got to make sure you're measuring the right numbers
[2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:19.460]  You know and and you know, whatever metrics you are collecting
[2:41:20.100 --> 2:41:25.780]  Is that the whole picture and also whatever metrics you're collecting will first of all they will be gained
[2:41:26.340 --> 2:41:31.700]  By internal people within the company like internal departments will gain the metrics because they have to because that's the pressure
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:37.140]  That is put on them and when they have to start making decisions about difficult things to cut or to put off or to whatever
[2:41:37.300 --> 2:41:42.500]  You know, they know what metrics they're judged on and so people will gain metrics
[2:41:42.660 --> 2:41:45.380]  That's it's the way that you know, and I know you're not a big sports fan
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:47.380]  But it's the reason that every single
[2:41:48.020 --> 2:41:50.020]  Team sport with a ball
[2:41:50.260 --> 2:41:54.580]  Has what seems to be from an outsider a complex set of rules?
[2:41:54.580 --> 2:41:57.860]  Like the more you learn about baseball the more you think these rules are crazy
[2:41:57.860 --> 2:42:00.500]  But it's all about the fact that if the game is about
[2:42:00.500 --> 2:42:05.540]  You know, how many people cross-home plate and touch home plate that if these rules weren't in place
[2:42:06.820 --> 2:42:09.860]  People teams would do whatever they could within the rules that are in place
[2:42:10.980 --> 2:42:12.980]  To game the game
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:14.980]  Right everything gets game
[2:42:16.100 --> 2:42:20.340]  You know that ties into the advertising discussion. We had four hours ago
[2:42:20.980 --> 2:42:27.460]  right so I do worry that if Apple is is putting all this emphasis internally on metrics
[2:42:27.460 --> 2:42:33.620]  I wonder what they're missing and because we've seen already, you know with the with the high ground thing
[2:42:33.620 --> 2:42:38.820]  We've seen that there are things they're missing and that they need to be shown that sometimes from the outside and and part
[2:42:38.820 --> 2:42:44.740]  Of the reason why I complain so much about certain things Apple does is because I know that that outside voices like ours
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:47.220]  Can affect things internally
[2:42:47.620 --> 2:42:49.620]  Usually whatever we are arguing about outside
[2:42:50.180 --> 2:42:51.860]  Somebody inside is arguing about two
[2:42:51.860 --> 2:42:57.860]  I think there's outside support for one viewpoint or the other we can you know you we can be giving ammunition to the side that we want to win the fight
[2:42:58.020 --> 2:43:02.660]  Yeah, I think that the whole discovery D thing was a perfect example of
[2:43:04.420 --> 2:43:07.220]  The type of thing that slipped through their metrics
[2:43:07.220 --> 2:43:11.380]  I mean one of the things I know that they specifically were thinking about were crash reports and
[2:43:11.940 --> 2:43:16.740]  That there's this whole opt-in system that Apple I think is very very upfront about and in fact
[2:43:16.740 --> 2:43:21.300]  There may even be too upfront about it because and when you upgrade your OS on systems
[2:43:21.300 --> 2:43:26.980]  You have to always re-opt into these things they might even ask they might they might even air on the side of asking too many times
[2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:32.260]  You know, you sure you want to let us have location services enabled on this device even if you've said it already
[2:43:32.260 --> 2:43:35.300]  You've just upgraded to a major new version of the OS to gonna ask you again
[2:43:36.660 --> 2:43:46.020]  So they they know that a most of an overwhelming majority of users on the Mac or Mac and iOS opt-in to the will you send us?
[2:43:46.020 --> 2:43:49.940]  You know the crash reports and stuff like that for helping us make things better
[2:43:49.940 --> 2:43:55.540]  And that's one of the things that they've measured and one of the things that they know has gone
[2:43:56.180 --> 2:43:59.380]  Way down in recent years is apps crashing. I
[2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:05.780]  An
[2:44:06.420 --> 2:44:08.420]  In terms of just disappearing and getting the
[2:44:10.020 --> 2:44:13.060]  And especially if I and and again, I'm not measuring
[2:44:13.060 --> 2:44:20.500]  Statistics again think about it just in my mind almost all the crashes. I see nowadays on my Mac are from beta software that I'm testing and that
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:22.820]  I expect to crash
[2:44:22.820 --> 2:44:26.420]  It feels to me like apps crash less especially Apple's apps
[2:44:27.620 --> 2:44:33.060]  Yeah, I'd say you're right and the whole discovery do you think all of the various problems that people have seen
[2:44:33.540 --> 2:44:36.340]  From it or the type of things that there aren't crashes
[2:44:36.340 --> 2:44:42.980]  They're just weird silent failures, you know like when the printer that I've been using for the last four years and
[2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:49.620]  And it's the only printer I use and I hit command P and nothing ever comes out of it
[2:44:49.620 --> 2:44:55.700]  And I go over to the thing with the red badge in my dock and it just says printer cannot be found and I go to this
[2:44:56.420 --> 2:44:58.420]  Thing and the system
[2:44:58.420 --> 2:45:06.980]  Settings and try to configure the printer and I can't configure it and I just sit here and I see if Amy can print and she can print
[2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:12.020]  But I can't it doesn't even see the printer and then I just turn the printer off and on and back on again and
[2:45:12.740 --> 2:45:19.460]  Now it all just works, but I haven't updated anything on my printer. That's for damn sure the printer hasn't changed at all
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:26.020]  That never gets reported to Apple that never you know, there is no crash log that gets sent there is no
[2:45:26.020 --> 2:45:31.380]  I you know Siri heard John cursing in his office about the fucking printer
[2:45:32.340 --> 2:45:34.660]  That never it doesn't register, right?
[2:45:34.660 --> 2:45:38.980]  It's a sort of thing that you just kind of have to you kind of have to play by feel and
[2:45:39.540 --> 2:45:42.660]  Internally you have to be like hey guys. This is a shit show this
[2:45:43.060 --> 2:45:47.580]  My Apple TV is keeps calling itself Apple TV parentheses 13
[2:45:48.420 --> 2:45:54.740]  Right and then and playing it by feel that as we honor that was one of Steve's greatest strengths that he was like
[2:45:54.740 --> 2:46:00.740]  He was really on point and yeah, he wasn't always perfect, but his track record was pretty good in playing it by feel and
[2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:05.140]  And so you know when when you move to this metric system you have to both a
[2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:10.900]  Make you know you have to be on the lookout for gaming and try to reduce it or eliminate the incentives for it
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:15.220]  We were whenever possible. That's that's an ongoing constant constant battle
[2:46:15.940 --> 2:46:21.220]  And B you have to really make you have to look at like what do the metrics not include?
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:27.700]  What what where are the blind spots of these metric of these metrics and every set of metrics is going to have massive blind spots
[2:46:27.940 --> 2:46:32.500]  And and that is where I think there is still room for improvement there
[2:46:32.500 --> 2:46:36.020]  And so if Apple is measuring their their below beloved customer set
[2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:38.820]  in in ways
[2:46:38.820 --> 2:46:44.180]  That that showed that 16 gig is is not a problem for most of the people who have it
[2:46:44.180 --> 2:46:47.620]  I mean, you know, they have a what they have way more data than we do
[2:46:47.620 --> 2:46:52.180]  So they could be right that could be true most of the things Apple says are you know
[2:46:52.180 --> 2:46:55.220]  On our surface level on the face of it. True like they you know
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:59.940]  They're you know like like my blog post like there was no deeper meaning like most of the things as you always say most of the
[2:46:59.940 --> 2:47:01.620]  Example says are pretty straightforward and true
[2:47:02.180 --> 2:47:08.180]  But this is one of those cases where if they keep saying that 16 gig is fine and that people are happy enough with it
[2:47:09.140 --> 2:47:11.540]  That is in really stark
[2:47:11.540 --> 2:47:16.900]  Um contrast and disagreement to what I and everyone I know
[2:47:17.380 --> 2:47:20.740]  Seize anecdotally from our friends and relatives who have 16 gig phones
[2:47:21.540 --> 2:47:26.660]  And and like I love like when underscore David Smith put posted his analysis of like free space
[2:47:26.900 --> 2:47:34.100]  I have that right here. Yeah. Yeah. That was that was great because that shows like actual broad data set from people who aren't all nerds
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:38.820]  Who have you know like how much free space they actually have and how many and you know
[2:47:38.820 --> 2:47:41.780]  We all everyone who has been around other people with iPhones
[2:47:41.780 --> 2:47:46.740]  We've all known people who like oh, they go to take a picture on their phones full or they keep it in the message
[2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:52.100]  That their phone is full or their iCloud storage is full and I have no idea what to do about that exactly and and you know
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:54.100]  iOS storage management has never been
[2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:57.460]  Particularly pretty clearly easy or obvious and how to do it
[2:47:57.780 --> 2:48:02.020]  Um, you know, there's all these all these problem people have people who are stuck on all those
[2:48:02.020 --> 2:48:09.860]  Glasses like that. I think they learned big time with how low the adoption rate was if iOS 8 compared to previous releases because they had all these
[2:48:09.860 --> 2:48:15.620]  Eight and 16 gig phones out of that didn't have space to install it and they just never people just never installed it
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:17.140]  I would I would say actually
[2:48:17.140 --> 2:48:23.140]  I think that the way that iOS deals with storage now in terms of dealing with a low storage situation is actually better than
[2:48:23.140 --> 2:48:28.900]  It's ever been in better than anything on the Mac and in terms because that the Mac you're dealing with the finder and
[2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:35.220]  You've already lost most people but yeah, the file system you've lost them and so the way that you can go into settings now
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:39.220]  And if you at least Google enough you can probably get someone to tell you
[2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:45.460]  You know go to settings go to general go to usage and it'll show you which apps are using how much data and then you can do
[2:48:45.460 --> 2:48:48.140]  Something right there and deal with it. That's actually pretty good
[2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:50.980]  And I think it's about it's good just blaming the whole app
[2:48:50.980 --> 2:48:53.980]  You know here this app is using four gigabytes
[2:48:53.980 --> 2:49:00.780]  It's about as good as it's going to get from for mass market typical people but you you're most people aren't going to get that far
[2:49:00.780 --> 2:49:07.260]  Like I just linked to a thing before we started recording today that around the world there's like five or six percent of
[2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:14.580]  Facebook users don't know that they're using the internet when they use Facebook that's great that you go around and pull people and
[2:49:14.580 --> 2:49:20.580]  And they say how much do you use the internet and you get you know, it's 40% and then do you use Facebook?
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:22.580]  And it's like 60%
[2:49:22.580 --> 2:49:24.580]  Well, how is that that's not really possible?
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:32.820]  They're obviously misinformed, but if you're surprised that there are that many people who don't realize that Facebook is on the internet
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:35.140]  You really just don't understand how
[2:49:36.340 --> 2:49:40.740]  Untechnical people are you know, and it's not does even say that they're not intelligent
[2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:46.660]  They just don't they might be unintelligent, but it might just be that they are not technically inclined and that
[2:49:46.660 --> 2:49:49.060]  Also, I see the decreasing relevance of the web
[2:49:49.060 --> 2:49:56.460]  I'd say that it's very possible very possible like the day and and and combine that with the age-old genius of
[2:49:56.980 --> 2:50:03.140]  Microsoft branding their browser internet explorer which made people think that that was the internet
[2:50:03.820 --> 2:50:04.980]  Yeah
[2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:10.580]  Which was very purposeful and again, it's tied into like the whole Joe camel marketing angle
[2:50:10.580 --> 2:50:13.860]  You know marketing is evil, you know from earlier in the show
[2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:20.580]  That was very deliberate and then they know they're not using the thing that's the internet because they're not using the browser
[2:50:20.580 --> 2:50:22.580]  And so therefore they're not using the internet
[2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:27.620]  That's just that's just the loose way people think about things and it speaks to the genius of
[2:50:28.420 --> 2:50:33.540]  Modern smartphones that they're able to do so much and share so much and be so engaged
[2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:37.700]  By not really understanding the underlying technology at all but
[2:50:37.700 --> 2:50:45.380]  You know therefore if you're surprised that people some number of people buy 16 gigabyte phones and have no idea that they're
[2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:48.580]  Sell, you know, they're doing themselves a great disservice
[2:50:49.380 --> 2:50:52.420]  It's not their fault. They that this is the bottom line
[2:50:52.420 --> 2:50:56.020]  I think it gets people upset like you say and people I know there's people there's people who are out there
[2:50:56.420 --> 2:51:00.100]  Rage swearing at us listening to the podcast saying, you know
[2:51:00.100 --> 2:51:04.260]  My company buys 16 gigabyte phones and they're just fine because we do blah blah blah
[2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:08.580]  If Apple wants to sell them to the enterprise fine sell them directly to the enterprise
[2:51:08.580 --> 2:51:15.780]  But don't sell them in retail stores to consumers because like underscores data shows that somewhere around 37% of those people
[2:51:16.180 --> 2:51:18.500]  Have at least his users of his app
[2:51:18.500 --> 2:51:21.780]  But I think it's very very possible that that's let's call it one in three
[2:51:21.780 --> 2:51:23.780]  So we'll even air on the you know
[2:51:23.780 --> 2:51:26.100]  Underscorsets 37 we'll call it 33
[2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:32.100]  One percent of the people with 16 gigabytes iPhones have under one gigabyte of space available
[2:51:32.100 --> 2:51:35.540]  Which is really really and some of them have you know really low
[2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:40.420]  Mounts under one gigabyte, but if you don't even have one gigabyte available
[2:51:40.420 --> 2:51:42.980]  You're really in trouble for a lot of little things
[2:51:43.380 --> 2:51:48.900]  Yeah, a lot of things just start failing for you at that point right like having the room to download 150 megabyte
[2:51:49.140 --> 2:51:55.380]  Podcast that you want to listen to or to record video like the thing that he showed that his wife got when she took out the
[2:51:55.380 --> 2:51:58.420]  Camera and she could not record video because there wasn't enough space
[2:51:58.420 --> 2:52:00.420]  And you know
[2:52:01.620 --> 2:52:07.620]  It it really bites you and then the other thing you look at in his stats is so the next step up now is 64
[2:52:07.620 --> 2:52:12.020]  And you look at how many people with 64 gigabyte phones have storage problems, and it's effectively none of them
[2:52:12.900 --> 2:52:15.620]  Yeah, I mean and the sad thing is you know
[2:52:15.620 --> 2:52:17.620]  I've heard rumblings here and there from various
[2:52:18.020 --> 2:52:20.020]  Tipsters some of us have no credibility
[2:52:20.820 --> 2:52:24.500]  I've heard rumblings that they are finally going to fix this next year
[2:52:24.500 --> 2:52:28.900]  And with the iPhone 7 it's going to start at either 32 or even 64
[2:52:29.380 --> 2:52:34.660]  I worry though like by the time if they ever move up to 32
[2:52:35.460 --> 2:52:37.460]  Maybe that's going to be too small by that point
[2:52:38.820 --> 2:52:42.980]  You know because you know the point of this it's very much like when when you're designing
[2:52:43.460 --> 2:52:46.260]  A app with a paywall and I have this in overcast
[2:52:46.260 --> 2:52:50.580]  You know when you're doing an app with a paywall of some sort whether it's a free trial with you know
[2:52:50.580 --> 2:52:55.860]  Shareware style unlock all features whatever um the idea is to
[2:52:56.980 --> 2:53:02.660]  Put that wall at a threshold such that you're creating a small pain point for people
[2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:07.540]  So that they won't like frustratingly quit your app and say well this is useless
[2:53:07.540 --> 2:53:08.900]  I can't even try it
[2:53:08.900 --> 2:53:12.980]  But you have to create that pain that pain point at such a place where
[2:53:13.700 --> 2:53:19.780]  Most people will reasonably run into it a few times and a good percentage of those people will run into it enough
[2:53:19.780 --> 2:53:23.700]  That it pushes them it motivates them into paying
[2:53:24.580 --> 2:53:29.620]  And I use the term pain point here intentionally like this is like you're causing like
[2:53:30.180 --> 2:53:33.860]  inconvenience or you're making people like hit a hit a wall that's unpleasant
[2:53:33.860 --> 2:53:37.860]  They want to go past because if you don't do that if you are too generous
[2:53:38.580 --> 2:53:40.580]  With what you give away for free
[2:53:40.580 --> 2:53:43.700]  Effectively nobody buys it great. This is one of the things like apps that have
[2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:50.500]  Add by default and you can pay to remove the ads historically those have very very low payment rates
[2:53:50.500 --> 2:53:53.460]  Almost no you know effectively almost nobody pays to remove ads
[2:53:53.460 --> 2:53:57.140]  I always I always I always I always made it say me too, but we're weird
[2:53:57.220 --> 2:54:01.620]  You know most people are just like well, okay, I'll take the ads like that isn't enough of a pain point
[2:54:02.260 --> 2:54:04.260]  Or if you say like
[2:54:04.260 --> 2:54:07.140]  Suppose you know you're you're supposed with the overcast
[2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:12.580]  If I said well in order to subscribe to more than three three podcasts
[2:54:12.580 --> 2:54:14.580]  You have to unlock the the pay thing
[2:54:15.540 --> 2:54:20.340]  Well, most people subscribe to like two podcasts or one and a half podcasts something about an average
[2:54:20.580 --> 2:54:27.140]  So hardly anybody would even would even hit that and then I would create this horrible incentive for people not to try out new shows
[2:54:27.540 --> 2:54:31.940]  So so like and that that's why I don't limit that you know, I limit other things, but I don't limit that
[2:54:32.900 --> 2:54:34.420]  and so
[2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:40.740]  You know with Apple you know when they're pricing their products when they're designing the the tiers of just deciding what what the
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:45.460]  Storage tiers or whatever the product lines, you know, where does the mini run to the air?
[2:54:45.460 --> 2:54:48.580]  Where does the air now run into the pro where on the MacBooks?
[2:54:48.580 --> 2:54:52.740]  How do you know where do the size boundaries lie and what capabilities do you have to move up to get?
[2:54:53.380 --> 2:54:59.540]  At each stage like all these things are designed to try to place those those barriers and those limits and those and those
[2:54:59.540 --> 2:55:02.180]  Boundaries between classes are between price levels
[2:55:02.580 --> 2:55:04.580]  Try to place them at a point where
[2:55:04.580 --> 2:55:12.420]  You're going to capture a lot more value from a lot of people who are going to hit those barriers and are going to want to push past them
[2:55:12.420 --> 2:55:13.300]  By paying you more money
[2:55:13.300 --> 2:55:17.380]  That is the whole point if they if if Apple did their job badly
[2:55:17.700 --> 2:55:20.100]  They would give away too much for free at the low end
[2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:25.780]  But Apple tries to do their job well, and they are very very good at that most of the time and so so
[2:55:26.100 --> 2:55:31.860]  When app like these these storage tiers are designed specifically to maximize that I
[2:55:31.860 --> 2:55:38.340]  I look at the iPad and the iPad Pro. I was just about 32 and 128 right and in the 128 is cellular only or it
[2:55:38.580 --> 2:55:44.180]  It's only available on the 128 right so like so there's only three available you can run for 799
[2:55:44.180 --> 2:55:50.500]  I think it's 799. I'm looking at my notes. Yeah, I think you're 799. You can get a 32 gigabyte no cellular for 949
[2:55:50.580 --> 2:55:55.620]  You can get 128 gigs no cellular and then for 10 79
[2:55:55.620 --> 2:56:02.660]  They're they're usual $130 upgrade for the cellular you can get 128 in cellular. Those are the only three
[2:56:03.140 --> 2:56:09.100]  Configurations available. I actually think that's great. I think it's great that it's a lot simpler that you don't have three storage tiers
[2:56:09.140 --> 2:56:12.980]  It's just two do you want the real one and let's face it the real one is the 128
[2:56:13.300 --> 2:56:18.980]  Do you want cellular or not and the 32 totally make sense in the context of
[2:56:18.980 --> 2:56:25.140]  Industrial uses of the iPad pro like for the enterprise and like single app uses
[2:56:25.860 --> 2:56:30.740]  Yeah, and I was talking to Dr. Wave from Pixar, you know, and they even publicized this is public information
[2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:36.420]  It's not secret that Apple was there at Pixar last week and letting their artists play with them and use them and
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:43.140]  Test the palm rejection which they were very pleased with I say very pleased that they called it like near perfect
[2:56:44.660 --> 2:56:48.180]  But I said to him I was like I'll bet that the 32 is the one you guys are gonna buy
[2:56:48.180 --> 2:56:51.140]  You know, yeah, of course because they don't store anything on that on that right
[2:56:51.140 --> 2:56:56.740]  It's all connected to their little internal internet and it's all stored on the servers and and so that they can share it
[2:56:56.740 --> 2:57:03.780]  And it's all there so you know the extra storage would be completely and utterly wasted on them and it's also the lack of cellular is a
[2:57:04.260 --> 2:57:07.460]  Feature because they don't want these things connected to cellular networks
[2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:12.900]  They want them connected only to their little internal network like the I didn't even talk to him about this
[2:57:12.900 --> 2:57:19.700]  But I know in the movie industry in general that whole thing. We're Sony got hacked has really really up to their game on security and places
[2:57:19.700 --> 2:57:21.700]  Like hospitals and stuff like that with all the HIPAA laws
[2:57:22.820 --> 2:57:24.020]  You know
[2:57:24.020 --> 2:57:27.780]  This configuration is perfect for them. It is not you know if you're a consumer though
[2:57:27.780 --> 2:57:30.220]  You want the 128 and you probably want the one with cellular
[2:57:31.260 --> 2:57:35.860]  Yeah, and I think it's very obvious and also the the low-end model
[2:57:36.180 --> 2:57:42.620]  32 is a great little low-end thing where there's still plenty of space for things like software updates and temporary
[2:57:42.620 --> 2:57:48.620]  Caches and big problems like that whereas like a 16 gigabyte model on that would have been like it just would be terrible
[2:57:49.100 --> 2:57:53.500]  Yeah, I mean like I like you know if I if I end up having to get one for various testing purposes
[2:57:54.060 --> 2:57:59.020]  I would get 32 because I wouldn't be like a power user of that right that feels like it's okay, but
[2:57:59.900 --> 2:58:03.420]  Just barely like it does feel kind of weird to spend
[2:58:04.380 --> 2:58:11.340]  $900 or $800 on this high-end thing and then to not spend the extra 150 or whatever
[2:58:11.340 --> 2:58:14.540]  To quadruple the storage because
[2:58:15.100 --> 2:58:20.940]  This is the kind of thing that you can never change you can never upgrade that storage in the other way or like it
[2:58:20.940 --> 2:58:22.940]  You can't undo that decision
[2:58:22.940 --> 2:58:28.780]  And and they know that when they're pricing it and when they're deciding these they know that and they know that a certain percentage of people
[2:58:29.180 --> 2:58:31.660]  Usually I would expect a pretty significant one
[2:58:32.380 --> 2:58:35.580]  Will fractionalize that same thought of well. I'm already spending
[2:58:35.580 --> 2:58:41.100]  $800 if I go up to 950 I'll quadruple this thing that might be a problem for me in the future if I don't do it
[2:58:41.340 --> 2:58:45.260]  You know like the and same thing with adding Apple care and everything else that this is how retailers always work
[2:58:45.260 --> 2:58:47.260]  This is this is business
[2:58:47.100 --> 2:58:48.140]  so
[2:58:48.140 --> 2:58:52.540]  All this is a very long way to say I definitely still believe that these 16 gig phones
[2:58:53.180 --> 2:58:58.700]  Are a decision to raise average selling price not because it is best for customers
[2:58:59.340 --> 2:59:01.580]  And and that I don't necessarily even
[2:59:02.620 --> 2:59:04.620]  I'm not even that mad at them about it because
[2:59:04.620 --> 2:59:06.860]  You know, that's just that's business
[2:59:06.860 --> 2:59:12.780]  I just don't think that's that's the kind of decision that they have to make to be successful and every business person does this and
[2:59:12.940 --> 2:59:14.940]  You know, Apple is not
[2:59:15.340 --> 2:59:21.580]  You know, Santa Claus like they're you know, they they're a business and they're gonna make money off of us and and we happily keep giving it to them
[2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:27.020]  And so they're obviously doing something right the only the one and last thing I want to point out want to make about this the other thing that
[2:59:27.020 --> 2:59:30.300]  That causes me to think about it a lot is that it's
[2:59:30.300 --> 2:59:37.260]  That it lat that the repercussions of this last for at least three years
[2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:43.260]  Because what it means is that next year the mid-tier phone is going to be a 16 gigabyte
[2:59:43.660 --> 2:59:49.740]  Start at a 16 gigabyte iPhone 6s and then two years from now the free free with contract
[2:59:49.900 --> 2:59:54.940]  $99 phone is going to be the iPhone 6s with 16 gigabytes. So there's going to be
[2:59:55.500 --> 2:59:59.180]  brand new iPhones that some people are buying with 16 gigabytes
[2:59:59.180 --> 3:00:01.180]  for at least the next three years
[3:00:02.780 --> 3:00:07.820]  Oh, yeah, I mean they've been selling eight at the low end. I think right. I don't know. Are they still now?
[3:00:08.620 --> 3:00:15.460]  I think that they were they were before last week. Yeah before last week still selling the five the five C had an eight gig
[3:00:15.660 --> 3:00:22.980]  Yeah, yeah, so you know, it's the fact that the minimum when the iPhone 5C came out was six made it
[3:00:22.980 --> 3:00:24.980]  You know, it made a difference
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:32.220]  And the minimum now at least the minimum in the U.S. is 16 now in the 5S. Yeah, they might sell eight somewhere around the world
[3:00:32.380 --> 3:00:37.540]  But you know, but that still means though that it's going to be 16 though for a while
[3:00:39.220 --> 3:00:41.220]  Exactly
[3:00:41.220 --> 3:00:45.260]  I thought I linked to it today and I don't want to repeat it
[3:00:45.260 --> 3:00:50.340]  I just tell people to go if you know because you and I don't have you know this episode is pretty short
[3:00:50.340 --> 3:00:55.540]  So if you still have a lot of time left for podcast listening go listen to it's a great podcast in general
[3:00:55.540 --> 3:01:01.460]  But I really thought it was a fantastic episode of upgrade with Jason Snell and Mike Hurley and they talked about
[3:01:02.100 --> 3:01:07.460]  upgrading to iOS 9 or or getting a new phone you buy a new iPhone you have an old iPhone
[3:01:07.540 --> 3:01:09.540]  You want to upgrade from your backup
[3:01:10.020 --> 3:01:17.180]  What an enormous pain in the ass that that really is and if anything it's gotten worse over the years because the phones do so much more and
[3:01:17.180 --> 3:01:21.780]  Ask so much more permission and some of the things I totally understand. I know it has to be that way
[3:01:21.780 --> 3:01:24.900]  It's actually a feature that you have to redo your fingerprints
[3:01:25.740 --> 3:01:28.500]  That's actually good even though it's a little bit of a pain in the ass
[3:01:29.060 --> 3:01:30.740]  You have to re-enter your credit cards
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:35.380]  I realize that's actually a feature because the credit card data is stored on a secure element
[3:01:35.380 --> 3:01:39.660]  And if it was a thing that they could just copy from one phone to another that wouldn't be a very secure element
[3:01:39.660 --> 3:01:44.060]  It's the fact that you it literally cannot be copied from there to here. That's great
[3:01:44.420 --> 3:01:46.420]  So some of those things are obviously
[3:01:46.420 --> 3:01:54.540]  It can't be avoided, but it takes so long and you and and it's so indeterminate what you're waiting for
[3:01:54.540 --> 3:01:58.060]  Like did you run into the do you upgrade when you get a new phone do you upgrade from a backup?
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:04.020]  Yeah, I do I do the iTunes encrypted back up and everything I this time. I did it mostly seamlessly
[3:02:04.940 --> 3:02:06.940]  Tiffs phone came with a dead sim card
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:12.460]  So we had to swap the sim on that one and I had I had the endless loop of
[3:02:12.460 --> 3:02:18.180]  I cloud authentication dialogues during the setup process problem, which I've heard a couple people mentioned that they ran into as well
[3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:23.580]  Yeah, other than that I like you know, I did the whole thing where I unpaired the watch then back up the phone
[3:02:23.660 --> 3:02:29.220]  Then restore to the new phone then repair the watch to the new phone and all the like it been mostly okay
[3:02:29.260 --> 3:02:34.420]  It's I've gotten this down because and again, this is not really a complaint
[3:02:34.420 --> 3:02:40.860]  It's you know, it's it's great that I get these review units and from to I get them two weeks early and I get to write about them
[3:02:40.860 --> 3:02:42.660]  For other people and I get to spend more time with them
[3:02:43.220 --> 3:02:51.100]  But now that they do two new phones a year five c5s six and six plus in the success and six plus I get two phones to test
[3:02:51.100 --> 3:02:54.740]  So there's two phones that I have to go through this with and then I always buy my own
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:02:57.020]  I already have my own. I bought my own. I don't you know
[3:02:57.020 --> 3:02:59.780]  I pay for my own fine. I personally use iPhone every year
[3:02:59.820 --> 3:03:01.980]  So that means I can appear at if like three weeks
[3:03:01.980 --> 3:03:06.380]  I do this with three phones every year and then later in the fall
[3:03:06.380 --> 3:03:11.540]  I generally wind up doing it with an iPad too, so and then I might buy it. I might buy my own iPad
[3:03:11.540 --> 3:03:14.220]  I don't buy a new iPad every year, but I at least test one
[3:03:14.220 --> 3:03:17.380]  So I I do this with like five or six devices every year
[3:03:17.380 --> 3:03:22.620]  I'll bet there's people with an Apple who do this more often because they're using test units of the hardware
[3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:28.180]  So that people inside Apple have to know this and I think that if you do it like I do more than once a year
[3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:30.620]  your
[3:03:30.620 --> 3:03:37.140]  The inadequacies of this system are in your face, and I really and and now that they're selling a
[3:03:38.100 --> 3:03:44.020]  Program to upgrade every year and encouraging people to upgrade every year. I really hope that that's somewhere within Apple
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:48.780]  There's a you know, this is a high priority. We really got a streamline this
[3:03:49.580 --> 3:03:53.900]  One thing I was not aware, but I was not aware. I'm sorry for the cross talk
[3:03:53.900 --> 3:03:59.020]  But I was not aware that if you do the iCloud backup you still have to re-enter all your passwords
[3:03:59.020 --> 3:04:05.380]  Yeah, yeah iCloud backup is not it doesn't count as encrypted like they don't because they don't want to store your passwords in iCloud
[3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:10.580]  So the iCloud keychain I think is is gonna be there a long-term solution around that which doesn't
[3:04:10.580 --> 3:04:13.540]  For the password like it always keeps it on one device, right? It doesn't actually
[3:04:14.100 --> 3:04:16.620]  That's why you have to like go to another device to approve it right
[3:04:17.460 --> 3:04:19.740]  But no, so that that's probably the long-term goal with that
[3:04:19.740 --> 3:04:24.820]  But I think one thing that is that is very obvious here first of all is that like once again
[3:04:24.820 --> 3:04:30.860]  Like sometimes sometimes stuff about the Apple watch kind of seems like it was developed like on a spaceship away from Apple
[3:04:30.860 --> 3:04:35.020]  Like like it just kind of got handed to them when it was done like there's certain things about it
[3:04:35.020 --> 3:04:40.700]  They're just like this is obviously like the rest of the company didn't see this or approve this before they got out
[3:04:40.700 --> 3:04:44.580]  Or like where did this come from you know, so there's certain things about and I think obviously
[3:04:45.500 --> 3:04:50.460]  the way the Apple watch deals with backing itself up to the iPhone and and
[3:04:51.300 --> 3:04:53.300]  moving it to a different phone
[3:04:53.300 --> 3:04:55.300]  It's very
[3:04:55.300 --> 3:05:01.900]  Unapple like if I can use that generalization. It is very much like this does not seem like it was wealth
[3:05:01.900 --> 3:05:06.740]  You know Apple's whole thing is like the integration top to bottom. They make everything they make the software
[3:05:06.740 --> 3:05:13.180]  They make the hardware they make the services they make everything the way the Apple watch pairs and backs up to a phone or doesn't rather
[3:05:13.900 --> 3:05:15.340]  is
[3:05:15.340 --> 3:05:18.900]  It just seems like this like thing that was tacked on and
[3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:27.220]  And it was not thought of with you know with integration in mind with the whole stack in mind with with what happens with your phone upgrade in mind
[3:05:27.660 --> 3:05:33.020]  And that seems like a massive oversight and hopefully that's just because it was it's a 1.0 and they'll get to it
[3:05:33.300 --> 3:05:39.020]  Because it does seem really weird that like by default your watch is
[3:05:39.700 --> 3:05:42.940]  Not backing up to your phone ever it seems does it
[3:05:42.940 --> 3:05:49.420]  It didn't only do it when you unpair it. I think so. Yeah, and if you so if you like wipe your old phone and
[3:05:50.180 --> 3:05:52.180]  while in the process of
[3:05:53.740 --> 3:05:59.660]  It's very easy to end up as a as an ideal Apple customer meaning ideal from Apple's perspective
[3:05:59.660 --> 3:06:03.380]  You're a big fan and when they when they release new things you just go out and buy them
[3:06:03.380 --> 3:06:06.180]  So you've already got an Apple watch and you're buying a new iPhone
[3:06:06.180 --> 3:06:14.500]  It's very very easy to wind up like like with a default factor in installed watch again and like losing your activity data
[3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:22.260]  Yeah, and that's that's a major like that could like as as a slacker who like barely holds together an exercise regime here like if
[3:06:22.900 --> 3:06:24.460]  I lost on my activity data
[3:06:24.460 --> 3:06:31.220]  That's a major demotivated to keep going because it's the whole point I get to the idea that I've got this street going that is the motivator
[3:06:31.220 --> 3:06:36.980]  Yeah, like that should not be taken as lightly, you know, temporary data and with all of hell kit
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:40.380]  This is but like how how crazy is it that the watch a?
[3:06:42.300 --> 3:06:46.980]  Doesn't seem to back itself up at all and be when it does back itself up
[3:06:46.980 --> 3:06:51.820]  It doesn't back up to iCloud it backs up to just that local phone right that is crazy
[3:06:52.220 --> 3:06:57.940]  Like the iCloud has existed for a long time iCloud backups have existed for a long time before the watch
[3:06:57.940 --> 3:07:03.500]  Why doesn't the watch regularly at night when it's plugged in just like the phone?
[3:07:03.900 --> 3:07:10.740]  Back itself up to iCloud and you don't have like one of the benefits of the watch is that you just don't have much user created data
[3:07:10.740 --> 3:07:13.940]  It's not even possible to have a lot of user created data that you know
[3:07:13.940 --> 3:07:19.700]  But the stuff that is there the metrics, you know, the biometrics and stuff like the fact that it's not you and and
[3:07:20.140 --> 3:07:24.300]  It's even just your settings and stuff. It's annoying to lose all that stuff if you
[3:07:24.300 --> 3:07:31.740]  Understand how it works. It makes sense why you have to first unpair it with the old phone and then and then it makes sense
[3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:33.740]  Why the unpair takes?
[3:07:33.980 --> 3:07:36.660]  Five minutes because that's when the backup takes place
[3:07:37.220 --> 3:07:43.140]  So why does it take five minutes to unpair your iPhone? Well because that's when it backs up so that you can then restore it
[3:07:43.140 --> 3:07:48.860]  When you're done you know like oh, well then that makes some sense doesn't make you say well that to that's a clever design
[3:07:48.860 --> 3:07:50.780]  It just makes you say, okay, that's why it takes
[3:07:50.780 --> 3:07:56.660]  But if you don't know that why in the world would you ever unpair it first? Why wouldn't you think as an Apple customer?
[3:07:56.660 --> 3:07:58.660]  I mean, I think it makes total
[3:07:58.940 --> 3:08:03.380]  Customer common sense that you would just think I bought a new iPhone. I already have an Apple watch
[3:08:03.380 --> 3:08:07.740]  I'm gonna restore from my backup and then my new phone will be paired with my Apple watch
[3:08:08.140 --> 3:08:13.940]  Yeah, that's what that is what like you can totally see a bunch of people making that assumption totally reasonably
[3:08:13.940 --> 3:08:19.780]  Right, and then if it like popped up and said, you know, do you want to switch your Apple watch your Apple watch can only be paired with one
[3:08:19.780 --> 3:08:23.100]  iPhone at a time. Would you like to switch to this new iPhone?
[3:08:23.700 --> 3:08:30.380]  Yes, please, okay, and then you would expect that to maybe spin for a couple of seconds and then it would just work
[3:08:33.140 --> 3:08:35.140]  Yeah, that this whole process
[3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:38.820]  It's you it seems like it's very much a 1.0 process
[3:08:38.820 --> 3:08:46.900]  Which is it isn't unfortunately with with the rest of the phone and the the the sad part of this to me that the discouraging part of this to me is
[3:08:46.900 --> 3:08:50.660]  is that most of this rests on
[3:08:51.220 --> 3:08:57.860]  The the parts of Apple's infrastructure that I think have the most problems usually. It's like the the store infrastructure
[3:08:59.380 --> 3:09:06.780]  Not even not necessarily like all of I thought but like the the backup and purchases part of it
[3:09:06.780 --> 3:09:10.740]  I think is really unreal especially the purchase. I mean this all goes back to the store. I hate the store
[3:09:10.740 --> 3:09:16.780]  This like that whole infrastructure seems like it has frequent problems and frequent bugs and
[3:09:17.580 --> 3:09:24.500]  And all of this seems to rest on that and iTunes which yay, right? So I
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:29.500]  Actually, don't have incredibly high hopes of this improving
[3:09:30.180 --> 3:09:32.180]  It's also it's it's also just very complex
[3:09:32.180 --> 3:09:37.300]  You know like the way the way Apple designs things as you said like you know with with the privacy in mind and with the
[3:09:37.300 --> 3:09:42.140]  Security that they do a lot of these things aren't possible to make significantly better
[3:09:42.140 --> 3:09:45.460]  You know like a lot of it like you know you you can't just transfer a particular
[3:09:45.460 --> 3:09:52.500]  You're credit card data because it doesn't you you actually can't do it with security in the designs that they have stuff like that
[3:09:52.500 --> 3:09:57.980]  Like a lot of this stuff works in ways like that where the answer is just well to make this better
[3:09:57.980 --> 3:10:00.460]  We would have to become Google and we're not gonna do that
[3:10:00.460 --> 3:10:05.940]  So it's just not gonna get better. Yeah, and like for example like the one that you mentioned a couple minutes ago
[3:10:05.940 --> 3:10:09.980]  I know I saw it at least one of the times I was upgrading a phone the last few weeks
[3:10:09.980 --> 3:10:13.660]  I know other people have seen it is this loop seeming loop of
[3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:16.980]  requests for your
[3:10:16.980 --> 3:10:18.340]  iCloud
[3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:23.740]  password yeah, and you know and and it just seems like it's so indeterminate
[3:10:23.820 --> 3:10:25.060]  Was I entering it wrong?
[3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:30.460]  I often do enter it wrong because entering a password on that little keyboard and you all you see of the bullets
[3:10:30.460 --> 3:10:33.980]  It's very easy to make a mistake. So a lot. I'm pretty sure I haven't nailed down
[3:10:33.980 --> 3:10:40.340]  I've now seen this about three or four times and two various restores and everything and I'm pretty sure it's related to two factor
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:45.020]  Authentication because what it seems like it's doing is something is checking for your password
[3:10:45.780 --> 3:10:50.620]  Very early on in the activation while the white screen is still up and it is before the two factor
[3:10:50.780 --> 3:10:56.540]  Authorization is is requested properly in that screen. So you can type in the right credentials
[3:10:56.540 --> 3:11:02.660]  And it's failing because lacking two factor. I think you're wrong or at least there's a way to get into it without two factor because
[3:11:02.660 --> 3:11:08.180]  I don't have two factor on because it's okay. I don't maybe I should but
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:12.900]  Probably well, I don't because it seems like two factor is such a pain in the ass
[3:11:12.900 --> 3:11:16.380]  And I don't want to go through it with all these iPhones. I register over here
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:25.220]  But I don't have it turned on on my one Apple ID and I know that I've seen this loop where I think I must have entered
[3:11:25.220 --> 3:11:30.380]  The password wrong because it keeps asking me and then I do it very very carefully pain-staking character at a time
[3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:34.020]  Character at a time and it still does it and then I think well
[3:11:34.020 --> 3:11:39.900]  Is it the same service? Is it like six different services are queued up to get my Apple ID and
[3:11:40.500 --> 3:11:45.580]  They can't share it because they're so siloed within the system or is it a bug?
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:51.340]  Is it should I keep entering it? That's the question? I think am I supposed to keep entering this or am I just
[3:11:52.060 --> 3:11:54.100]  Going in the circle here where it's never gonna stop?
[3:11:54.100 --> 3:12:00.580]  Let's see well, so see when I when I enter it in this loop it actually then shows me a second dialogue saying authorization failed
[3:12:00.580 --> 3:12:06.180]  Oh, so that's actually telling me it is failing and then so I'll just keep hitting cancel cancel cancel on the next few of them
[3:12:06.180 --> 3:12:11.100]  And it's like an infinite alert box in JavaScript like it you just can't you have to like hit cancel fast enough
[3:12:11.100 --> 3:12:16.540]  And then like between boxes you got to like hit the next stage of the screen like go to the next screen and get past that
[3:12:16.740 --> 3:12:17.940]  It's really terrible
[3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:20.220]  What I what I've seen is it doesn't even tell you that it failed
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:28.020]  It just asks again as though it's asking for the first time over and over and over again and usually it helps to power down the phone and power it back on or
[3:12:29.580 --> 3:12:34.340]  My go-to thing which works for a lot of these things is to sign out and sign back in
[3:12:35.420 --> 3:12:37.420]  Which can be a huge pin in the ass?
[3:12:37.420 --> 3:12:40.860]  Because you loot, you know, it then it's like you know all your contacts are gone
[3:12:40.860 --> 3:12:42.560]  You have to wait for them to resync down and stuff
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:48.940]  And I'll loosen your photos your music like now and now everything's tied in right? But anyway the whole process is is not good
[3:12:48.940 --> 3:12:55.180]  And I really think that they ought to improve that and I worry my big concern is that maybe at the executive level
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:12:58.040]  They've got people who set their phones up for them, and so they don't see it and
[3:12:58.900 --> 3:13:04.180]  And then they can hear the complaints, but it's one of those things were hearing that complaint
[3:13:04.180 --> 3:13:06.500]  Ah, come on. It took you half an hour to set up your phone big deal
[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:09.660]  It's very different than if if they had to see it
[3:13:09.660 --> 3:13:13.260]  I just can't help it feel that if you know Tim Cook or Phil Schiller Johnny
[3:13:13.260 --> 3:13:19.900]  I've went through what I've gone through with some of these new iPhones this year personally that they would be like this this this this
[3:13:19.900 --> 3:13:23.500]  Needs a swift kick in the ass. Yeah, somebody throwing a phone and a fish tank
[3:13:27.260 --> 3:13:31.580]  That's as good a place as the any to end we've gone on plenty long enough
[3:13:31.740 --> 3:13:33.740]  Let me thank our sponsors
[3:13:34.140 --> 3:13:38.140]  Often forget to do this in the show, but I won't this time our sponsors this week fracture
[3:13:38.140 --> 3:13:43.660]  The people who make the pictures igloo the internet. You'll actually like
[3:13:43.660 --> 3:13:49.980]  Just works there the the the the place where you can go to take care of your HR and payroll and stuff like that
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:58.060]  And lastly the bra work group who make both an amazing utility for your Mac called Ubar and a
[3:13:58.620 --> 3:14:02.460]  $750 really nice custom design sapphire glass
[3:14:02.460 --> 3:14:08.220]  Analog automatic watch which is really really worth looking at even if you're not going to buy it
[3:14:08.620 --> 3:14:10.780]  So my thanks to them in Marco. I thank you
[3:14:11.580 --> 3:14:13.580]  Tremendously always have to thank you for the time
[3:14:14.460 --> 3:14:16.460]  You're very generous with it
[3:14:16.460 --> 3:14:40.460]  Thanks. Yeah, I always have fun on this show even for three hours
