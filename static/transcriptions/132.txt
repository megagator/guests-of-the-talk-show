[00:00.000 --> 00:03.640]  I'm worried because I feel like whenever you're on the show we always go and
[00:03.640 --> 00:07.680]  you're the by far the longest guests like I feel like we could go like if we
[00:07.680 --> 00:11.040]  ever needed to do like a charity talk-a-thon me and you would be the two
[00:11.040 --> 00:16.360]  we can go for 12 hours and then this time we actually have a lot to talk
[00:16.360 --> 00:21.080]  about so I'm a little concerned but well maybe not start moving did you hear we
[00:21.080 --> 00:28.000]  don't talk anymore that that you got to me and that that somehow it with the
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.920]  specifics are kind of vague as to how how you got to me and what that means
[00:31.920 --> 00:34.880]  but somehow you got to me and we don't talk anymore
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.000]  well heads people said that if there's been further speculation that we're on
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.480]  the out oh my god I mean fortunately it's it's died down in the last few days
[00:45.480 --> 00:49.880]  I think people have finally moved on from the peace saga which is good the
[00:49.880 --> 00:53.880]  internet has a very short attention span and that that is both a blessing and a
[00:53.880 --> 00:57.200]  curse it is it is definitely a blessing when you are on the receiving end of it
[00:57.200 --> 01:04.200]  so that is nice but yeah I heard I read and got emailed and heard lots of
[01:04.200 --> 01:08.800]  interesting theories about the conspiracy between you and I or that
[01:08.800 --> 01:15.000]  that you got to me or paid me off because people couldn't possibly believe
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.360]  that the story was what I said it was which is that I didn't want to be in
[01:20.360 --> 01:25.360]  this business after all so I exited it right you told this story on on your
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.520]  podcast the ATP probably not what is now the last episode I'm guessing you have
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.800]  an episode coming out tomorrow but the today from last already out well I have
[01:35.800 --> 01:39.440]  not listened so you can stop me if we start covering this time stuff but last
[01:39.440 --> 01:41.760]  week's episode where you covered the piece thing you're more or less long
[01:41.760 --> 01:48.760]  very a very long story very short is that what you wrote as always is exactly
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.560]  the truth you you are one of the most almost painfully honest people I have
[01:53.560 --> 01:58.400]  ever met like were you you almost can't even bring yourself to tell like white
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.960]  lies you know what I mean it's it if you go through something like this and then
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.600]  you explain yourself in public you're what you say is the honest-to-god truth
[02:08.600 --> 02:12.680]  so it's very funny that everybody would just assume that it could be it was
[02:12.680 --> 02:15.800]  something else and I think the part the part of the story that is the best it
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.520]  was that that again you know people who listen to ATP last week know this that
[02:20.520 --> 02:26.400]  you I guess it was what last Thursday or was it Friday I don't know what day of
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.840]  the week it was but I was at the dentist and I was waiting to go and you texted
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.880]  me and you're like I think I'm gonna pull piece from the App Store and I
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.280]  texted you don't don't do it don't be rash wait wait till I'm out of the
[02:39.280 --> 02:42.280]  dentist and I got home and it was already pulled from the App Store and
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.120]  the thing was there so I literally you did not you know pull a lot of people
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.720]  you had kind of made up you obviously you'd made up your mind because you know
[02:50.720 --> 02:54.720]  I told you not to do it which we will get to I will explain why I thought you
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.360]  should not do it but it was a very it did amuse me greatly though then
[02:59.360 --> 03:02.640]  afterwards when then I did notice immediately afterwards that there were
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.400]  an awful lot of people who assumed that it was pressure from me somebody
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.920]  somebody more or less said that it was like that me and could all you know
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.840]  showed up with baseball bats that I would have loved to see that it was
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.720]  especially funny because I was literally just hanging out with you and Kuda like
[03:18.720 --> 03:26.560]  four days earlier yeah it was interesting I also heard I yeah I was
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.520]  briefly 90 people like I heard people people thought that Apple paid me off
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.800]  which is the funniest I think is like I was making them a ton of money you know
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.280]  promoting their platform doing everything they wanted me to do and it
[03:41.280 --> 03:50.560]  wasn't also it also wasn't one of those things like today view widgets right
[03:50.560 --> 03:55.040]  where they say okay now over here on this today's screen on iOS what's that
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.000]  called it doesn't matter well whatever you know what it but you can think it's
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.720]  calling you actually you can put a widget in there yeah and and when they
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.000]  first opened this up there were people who made things that did things that
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.840]  were creatively outside the the purview of what they expected people to to make
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.520]  and then you know so like I think one of the ones that was an early victim of
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.760]  this was I think pcalc the calculator maybe so you can actually do your
[04:24.760 --> 04:27.760]  computation over there well that was more than they kind of I think they
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.560]  envisioned it as more just like a status view like it would show you the weather
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.240]  or whatever you know and when people were actually doing real things over
[04:35.240 --> 04:40.800]  there Apple you know reacted this isn't that sort of this because and it wasn't
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.760]  like they were breaking you know wasn't like they were using private API's they
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.360]  were using the public API's in ways that Apple didn't envision well peace was not
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.760]  like like you you use the content blocking API's in a way that they didn't
[04:52.760 --> 04:58.040]  envision it was almost like right down the middle the canonical this is
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.160]  exactly the sort of thing that they envisioned would be made yeah I mean like
[05:02.160 --> 05:06.120]  I the the I got a couple of responses here and there from inside of Apple and
[05:06.120 --> 05:11.040]  they were all extremely positive like they they did they definitely did not
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.360]  want me to pull it from the App Store as far you know based on the implication
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.520]  that they would have hated it for some reason like I mean you know they're
[05:18.520 --> 05:22.680]  they're not very generous with their communication but it sure seemed like
[05:22.680 --> 05:28.520]  people in Apple were big fans of it and and when I pulled it and placed the
[05:28.520 --> 05:32.240]  burden on them to try to issue all these refunds first manually and then
[05:32.240 --> 05:36.280]  eventually they did that batch thing that couldn't have been pleasant for
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.200]  them either and certainly couldn't have been cheap to have to process all those
[05:39.200 --> 05:42.960]  refunds and and you know just the heat the manpower alone of processing all
[05:42.960 --> 05:48.280]  those refunds was was getting to be probably significant so yeah yeah the
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.280]  idea that Apple paid me off to do all this it was pretty entertaining I also
[05:53.280 --> 06:00.720]  heard that advertisers somehow paid me off I man an app that sits at the top of
[06:00.720 --> 06:03.760]  the App Store paid app chart if that could have sat there for like a month I
[06:03.760 --> 06:07.640]  don't know if anyone else would have been able to afford to pay it off I mean
[06:07.640 --> 06:11.680]  it was it would have made it a ton of money and that's you know that's
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.760]  assuming a lot of course but if you could have sat there for a while you
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.360]  know that would have that would have been a good amount of money but you
[06:18.360 --> 06:21.960]  know it's it's it would have the whole reason I cancel it was that it would
[06:21.960 --> 06:25.760]  have felt it would have felt like making a ton of money off of like drug dealing
[06:25.760 --> 06:28.280]  or something like it didn't it didn't feel right you know that was the whole
[06:28.280 --> 06:34.260]  point I am looking right now I actually have not been paying attention to see
[06:34.260 --> 06:40.800]  what is atop the top chart so the top paid is a ray tweet bot for I think
[06:40.800 --> 06:47.000]  today probably tweet bot yeah but number two yeah is purify yeah but I think a
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.560]  crystal was up there for a while and pure or purify I forget what I think I
[06:50.560 --> 06:53.560]  have to you got to look at grossing though but grossing is they don't even
[06:53.560 --> 06:57.960]  register it's all candy it's all candy crush yeah that's that's been up there
[06:57.960 --> 07:03.440]  for a while well I was at on on pieces top day the one full day was on the
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.160]  chart it was grossing that I think my number 17 or 18 for a little while not
[07:07.160 --> 07:11.280]  for the whole day but that was that was the peak and then it was able to fall
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.560]  down the grossing ranks pretty far while still being number one in the paid chart
[07:15.560 --> 07:20.560]  to give you you know like it the volumes are much lower obviously and paid but
[07:20.560 --> 07:24.200]  yeah it would mean any app that's gonna sit there anywhere like in the top 20
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.560]  paid it's gonna be making really good money for a while so and I don't you
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.800]  know if other people want to go in there and make a ton of money making ad
[07:31.800 --> 07:37.040]  blockers that's fine like I'm willing and happy to yield that ground to other
[07:37.040 --> 07:41.480]  people that's why I did it you know it's I got there realized I really didn't
[07:41.480 --> 07:46.320]  like being there and left yeah I actually haven't looked in a while it
[07:46.320 --> 07:48.880]  seems weird to me though I thought that there would be a couple up there but it
[07:48.880 --> 07:53.920]  looks like it's all down to purify now that doesn't I don't see any of the
[07:53.920 --> 07:56.880]  others although maybe maybe they're on the free list in there I don't know
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.520]  which one's popular I thought there were a couple that would be popular though
[08:00.520 --> 08:04.680]  for a while crystal and purify were neck and neck and then I think maybe pure
[08:04.680 --> 08:08.720]  foot maybe crystals thing with the acceptable ads that's I mean that's a
[08:08.720 --> 08:12.200]  whole other drama that I don't really want to get into because I'm not
[08:12.200 --> 08:18.480]  involved happily anymore but it that's the kind of thing where it just shows
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.960]  how incredibly messy and difficult this business is and that's a perfect example
[08:22.960 --> 08:27.120]  of why I don't want to be in it after all because it is just very messy and
[08:27.120 --> 08:32.440]  very difficult as we record on on Thursday October 1st crystal is all the
[08:32.440 --> 08:38.480]  way down at 32 on the top paid and like I said purifies number two so obviously
[08:38.480 --> 08:42.240]  there's been some divergence there but you you you know and and there is this
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.720]  weird self perpetuating it's this you know we've talked about this in so many
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.120]  different contexts ever since the App Store open but once something is a top
[08:50.120 --> 08:54.200]  these charts it tends to stay there because one of the ways that people
[08:54.200 --> 08:57.560]  people hear hey I hear there's odd ad blockers for iOS they go to the App
[08:57.560 --> 09:01.120]  Store what do they do they go to the top chart they see one that looks reasonable
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.840]  at the top of the chart and they get it and by that time then they get it purify
[09:05.840 --> 09:09.360]  works it you know definitely does what it says on the tin so then they're done
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.280]  you know they've just spent two or three bucks or whatever it costs on their
[09:12.280 --> 09:15.220]  thing and they're done and then none of the other you know so being at top is a
[09:15.220 --> 09:19.440]  huge advantage so you you know peace having started at the top I think
[09:19.440 --> 09:23.040]  there's a very good chance that it would still be there today if you if you hadn't
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.080]  yanked it maybe but at the same time like you know right now you could see
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.840]  like purify has already fallen to number two you know we'll see you know how much
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.200]  it stays at the top or how much it falls over time I mean it's only been a couple
[09:35.200 --> 09:38.080]  of weeks it's been a pretty short time so I don't even know if I would have
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.920]  been able to be there for a month I don't even know if that would have
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.760]  happened you know there's no way to know yeah it doesn't matter like I also
[09:44.760 --> 09:48.000]  wonder how much this is gonna be one of those things where it's not like
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.360]  sustained not that it's not a sustainable business because I don't
[09:51.360 --> 09:58.300]  think it's that much development work to keep it going but that let's say 15 to
[09:58.300 --> 10:03.560]  20 percent of iOS users might be interested in a content blocker well how
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.360]  soon until all of them already have one and then then what I don't I'm not quite
[10:08.360 --> 10:13.440]  sure if if it's gonna be a chart topper perpetuity yeah and we tried
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.520]  speculating on that on ATP like like what percentage of iOS people are likely
[10:17.520 --> 10:24.080]  to actually install and critically enable an ad blocker and we came to
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.680]  about 10% being our estimate of people who would actually enable it also
[10:27.680 --> 10:30.440]  because you have to like go through the settings menu and dive down to the
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.740]  Safari settings and actually turn it on and that in that convoluted settings
[10:33.740 --> 10:39.600]  things so then like the the idea that ad blockers are going to all of a sudden
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.240]  ruin everyone's lives I think is unlikely and and probably exaggerated
[10:45.240 --> 10:50.720]  yeah I think it's likely I don't think it's likely that it would be that much
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.920]  different than on the desktop and on the desktop I that I pulled the 15% from
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.840]  what I think is what people estimate is the desktop number and obviously that
[11:00.840 --> 11:04.840]  changes yeah that seems a lot changes a lot based on the audience you know I
[11:04.840 --> 11:09.720]  know ours technica for oh yeah is really really hit hard by that because their
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.960]  audience is technically adept you know my site probably is to some extent just
[11:14.960 --> 11:18.080]  because at least there's a high percentage of people who read my site
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.160]  who know what an ad blocker is and you know feel very very calm you know
[11:22.160 --> 11:27.440]  confident installing an extension it's also worth pointing out like you know
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.040]  there's a lot of people so it's also worth pointing out that there's there's
[11:32.040 --> 11:36.540]  a lot of like all those people who install the ad blockers who are like
[11:36.540 --> 11:39.640]  more likely to install blockers like like nerds who visit our technical and
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.240]  your site how likely were they to click on the display ads to begin with you
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.040]  know like I bet the ratio I mean I've always kind of suspected that display
[11:49.040 --> 11:56.120]  ads on the internet are mostly supported by inadvertent accidental clicks or
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.920]  people who don't realize they're clicking on an ad who click who are
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.680]  misled into clicking on it by it looking like content or by one of those like
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.560]  stupid story ads like you know top ten ways to lift your face up like all those
[12:08.560 --> 12:12.360]  crazy things like I've always kind of suspected that the bulk of display
[12:12.360 --> 12:19.360]  advertising online was being clicked through and funded by really accident or
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.920]  novices fueled by ignorance and confusion yeah it's really it and you
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.400]  know I'm sure that's I'm sure that's not all of it but I bet it's a lot more than
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.560]  both the advertisers and the publishers would like to believe yeah well it's it
[12:35.560 --> 12:42.760]  is truly a they truly opened a Pandora's box way back in the 90s when they first
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.400]  started measuring clicks in the first place and I've linked to this over the
[12:47.400 --> 12:50.800]  years you know in numerous contexts talking about ads but it's come back up
[12:50.800 --> 12:58.360]  again it it's it is absolutely a case of be careful what you measure coming to
[12:58.360 --> 13:03.680]  bite them because at first when nobody was trying to game the system at all the
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.960]  idea of counting the actual clicks on the ads was amazing because nobody ever
[13:08.960 --> 13:15.240]  knew when you when you put an ad in a magazine you have a good guess that the
[13:15.240 --> 13:18.520]  circulation numbers are probably pretty accurate because they were you know
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.480]  industry standards you know maybe they tried to fudge them a little bit for the
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.800]  most part it was so expensive to print magazines they couldn't be that far off
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.480]  but how many people actually read your ad if it's on page 13 or you know how
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.520]  many people skip right past it you know what what was the register to actually
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.720]  be able to measure it in a meaningful way you know TV commercials could never
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.960]  really be measured it if there was no gaming if everybody was honest in the
[13:43.960 --> 13:48.680]  world which is probably the biggest stupidest if I've ever put forward
[13:48.680 --> 13:54.320]  counting the clicks on ads would be great and it did at first at web
[13:54.320 --> 14:00.320]  advertising was like super super expensive like in a per customer you
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.720]  know however you want to measure that because it could be measured but then as
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.000]  soon as people could you know as soon as that started working people immediately
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.360]  started gaming it in various ways so it's you know once and once they started
[14:13.360 --> 14:17.560]  going down that path it was doomed and still is to this day the fact that they
[14:17.560 --> 14:21.520]  try to measure it right because and then you have all these problems with click
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.960]  fraud and botnets doing click fraud and all this stuff it's it's this whole
[14:25.960 --> 14:31.840]  world of people trying to rip each other off it's just disgusting to me that's
[14:31.840 --> 14:34.240]  again it's one of the reasons why I didn't want to be in the business after
[14:34.240 --> 14:39.600]  all just it's just it's just a dirty messy world at a fundamental level the
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.720]  way I view advertising is even online is that it's fundamentally no different
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.400]  than advertising in in print or on TV and and which is to say that it is
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.120]  primarily about awareness making people aware maybe people who've never heard of
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.360]  your product making them aware of it for the first time or if they have heard of
[14:56.360 --> 15:02.120]  it reinforcing it with your brand you know it you know if it's some kind of
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.800]  visual ad or with some kind of message about it like for example like the ads
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.060]  I'll be reading during this podcast where you're not seeing anything but you
[15:11.060 --> 15:15.680]  can hear these talking points here's what they want you to know about it so
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.240]  that you have it in your head so that if you need a new mattress you can think
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.160]  well what about that one that all these podcasts are talking about or something
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.960]  like that just so it's in your head awareness the fact that online ads can
[15:26.960 --> 15:33.240]  actually lead to engagement quicker meaning you know you can just click on
[15:33.240 --> 15:38.240]  an ad and go and you're already at the field notes website and you can buy the
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.680]  notebook right there that that's great but that should just be you know anybody
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.520]  who's deciding how much to spend online versus print or on TV that should just
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.440]  be icing on the cake it still should primarily be look if we put an ad on
[15:51.440 --> 15:54.840]  this website we think we're gonna we can expect a hundred thousand people will
[15:54.840 --> 16:00.440]  see it and we roughly know that they're you know the demographics are like this
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.280]  that's really all they they should be looking at but the fact that they think
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.680]  that they can like identify people you know we'll spend this money and it'll
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.920]  only go to people who've searched in Google Maps for an oil change in the
[16:12.920 --> 16:19.680]  last 25 days it's just crazy and it leads to all sorts of sickness yeah and
[16:19.680 --> 16:25.880]  all sorts of really creepy and perverse incentives and behavior like it's one of
[16:25.880 --> 16:33.600]  those worlds where anybody who who is kind of privacy and sensibly minded or
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.480]  anybody who has really strong ethics I think is often driven out of that
[16:38.480 --> 16:45.520]  business like because if they won't do it someone else will you guys on ATP you
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.480]  guys compared it to the pornography industry and then I think you guys kind
[16:50.480 --> 16:53.080]  of backed away from it because it's almost like wow that's a real strong
[16:53.080 --> 16:56.120]  comparison but I actually think it's actually really I think that's not a bad
[16:56.120 --> 17:03.360]  comparison at all in terms of that you're it it's not you know remove any
[17:03.360 --> 17:06.920]  judgment of whether the existence of pornography in and of itself has any
[17:06.920 --> 17:14.840]  sort of moral you know any kind of moral quandary that you should be pondering
[17:14.840 --> 17:21.520]  it's just that you end up in programming and doing things that are you know
[17:21.520 --> 17:28.720]  whoever is implementing it is unhealthy right that if you know if it's some kind
[17:28.720 --> 17:34.000]  of paper thing for porno you you're you know that they're they're set up in a
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.800]  way somebody had to program the system that enables somebody who's got like an
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.160]  addiction to the stuff to just keep spending as much money as they can
[17:41.160 --> 17:47.600]  that's you know that is absolutely immoral I mean and either somebody feels
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.440]  really guilty about that or somebody who wrote that code just doesn't have a
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.120]  moral compass that points that way a lot of this stuff the programmatic stuff and
[17:56.120 --> 18:01.240]  advertising is it's down that path you know it's maybe not quite as far but
[18:01.240 --> 18:05.940]  it's it's pretty pretty bad you know that you're doing things that you know
[18:05.940 --> 18:10.300]  that the user isn't happy about that isn't good for them and that they
[18:10.300 --> 18:15.000]  wouldn't want to know exactly what's going on right and and one of the
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  problems that that you know so that's the side of the advertiser the side of
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.120]  the ad blocker of like the person or company making and running the ad
[18:24.120 --> 18:29.160]  blocker itself that faces an interesting dilemma where and I think you see this
[18:29.160 --> 18:32.480]  playing out with this acceptable ads thing with adblock plus and crystal and
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.080]  the the controversy the sister it up the and and some things you said about the
[18:37.080 --> 18:39.520]  deck and everything and how the deck had their privacy policy and everything and
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.240]  whether you know the question of whether the deck should be should count as an
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.360]  advertiser that should be blocked one of the problems here I face this with
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.640]  instapaper back forever ago I faced the problem that what people actually
[18:53.640 --> 18:59.400]  wanted was to get the articles without ever viewing the ads won't even once
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.160]  they wanted me to go out and scrape new articles for them they had never seen
[19:03.160 --> 19:08.520]  before and show them immediately in the in the ad strip text view like that's
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.400]  what people actually want and what's actually healthy for publishers and for
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.520]  the world and for me legally was not to do things like that it was to say you
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.580]  know okay well I'm gonna save things you have viewed in your web browser you know
[19:20.580 --> 19:24.680]  like that's that's different and it was it was always a really tricky balance
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.440]  because the the user base you know the the customer the market was pushing me
[19:29.440 --> 19:33.920]  to go over that line and I would always try to hold back a little bit but not
[19:33.920 --> 19:37.640]  all my competitors did and that hurt me and I think in the ad blocker industry I
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.680]  think you're gonna see that you see the same thing which is you know we can talk
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.480]  all we want about how like you know well like I also on ATP I compared it kind of
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.200]  to piracy and it's not these aren't great comparisons so please don't email
[19:50.200 --> 19:55.880]  us but you know it's it has some overlap is what I will say about that and in the
[19:55.880 --> 19:59.360]  sense that like you know making an ad blocker is kind of like making money
[19:59.360 --> 20:04.440]  from piracy it's like well people are gonna pay me to hide everyone else's ads
[20:04.440 --> 20:08.920]  and I can say well I can justify it with reasons X Y & Z many of which are
[20:08.920 --> 20:12.800]  perfectly valid things like security tracking creepiness etc those are all
[20:12.800 --> 20:19.560]  very valid reasons but if I made an ad blocker that only blocked tracking and
[20:19.560 --> 20:26.360]  still showed ads nobody would want it because what people actually want is to
[20:26.360 --> 20:29.520]  block all the ads and all the tracking and the and the security and the
[20:29.520 --> 20:33.480]  creepiness those are all convenient justifications for them just like when
[20:33.480 --> 20:36.940]  people pirate stuff they say well it wasn't available in my country yet or it
[20:36.940 --> 20:40.440]  wasn't available without DRM in the format I wanted on the box I wanted to
[20:40.440 --> 20:43.440]  play it on whatever like people can rationalize all sorts of reasons for
[20:43.440 --> 20:48.800]  piracy while also knowing yeah it's also kind of not right and so that's that's
[20:48.800 --> 20:52.560]  how I was feeling about ad blocking when I when I quit was like I I could
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.040]  rationalize a whole bunch of reasons why this needs to exist and why I might even
[20:57.040 --> 21:00.080]  want to still run one which I do right now I still run ghostery on my computer
[21:00.080 --> 21:04.760]  and I still run I'm I'm switching between various blockers on my phone
[21:04.760 --> 21:09.680]  trying to find a good one I'm currently using one blocker you know people people
[21:09.680 --> 21:13.760]  will rationalize these reasons but to be the person making it and enabling this
[21:13.760 --> 21:18.560]  and making money from it even it puts it on a different level and there's always
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.640]  gonna be this tension between you know trying to make it seem morally
[21:22.640 --> 21:29.160]  acceptable but also the reality of what the market really wants is to get
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.960]  everything for free and to not see any ads ever and no matter what they say if
[21:32.960 --> 21:35.360]  they if they say it's all about something else it's all about tracking
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.360]  whatever some people are honest about that most aren't most people just want
[21:40.360 --> 21:43.400]  to block all the ads I disagree I really do disagree I think there's definitely
[21:43.400 --> 21:48.920]  some subset of people who really do want to block the ads really do you know sort
[21:48.920 --> 21:55.080]  of the what's that there's even a magazine was that called sort of like an
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.640]  anti-advertising magazine we need the summer reports no no no you today's to
[22:00.640 --> 22:06.440]  sell it at Whole Foods but they don't need more but it's it'll come to me we
[22:06.440 --> 22:11.680]  need a goddamn forum like you guys have it's the people who are opposed to
[22:11.680 --> 22:15.760]  advertising in general not just online advertising but who actually are
[22:15.760 --> 22:21.840]  Crusaders about the you know that that advertising is a perverse force on on on
[22:21.840 --> 22:25.920]  our society you know and it's obviously you don't have to go far to find cases
[22:25.920 --> 22:30.720]  there are some cases where it is you know you know the cigarette companies
[22:30.720 --> 22:36.360]  and the advert you know the way that that they've been that legislation has
[22:36.360 --> 22:39.860]  been passed that you they really can't advertise anymore and that when they
[22:39.860 --> 22:43.960]  used to be able to they really did you could prove it that they they they
[22:43.960 --> 22:51.380]  targeted their ads to children you know famously the Joe camel cartoon mascot
[22:51.380 --> 22:59.480]  for camel cigarettes was if there were polls where they would go and and you
[22:59.480 --> 23:04.280]  know talk to kindergartners and they're amazing amazing brand awareness in
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.840]  kindergarten age kids of the mascot for a cigarette company that's really sick
[23:08.840 --> 23:12.200]  and it wasn't an accident it was actually planned so yeah that's it you
[23:12.200 --> 23:15.360]  know there's an example there are people who kind of feel that way about all ads
[23:15.360 --> 23:19.920]  and and and maybe it's not even the messaging but there's others who are
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.400]  clearly online who really care about every single bite of data every bite
[23:26.400 --> 23:30.960]  somebody pointed out to me for example and and with daring fireball in the deck
[23:30.960 --> 23:36.960]  the deck ads are so small compared to online ads you know in general but
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.720]  because during fireball has almost no images oftentimes has no images other
[23:42.720 --> 23:49.200]  than like the logo on the whole homepage the deck actually comprises a
[23:49.200 --> 23:53.240]  significant portion of the average page view especially if you don't even look
[23:53.240 --> 23:56.160]  at the whole homepage where there is a whole big wall of text but if you just
[23:56.160 --> 24:02.360]  go to like an individual short entry a significant portion maybe even a
[24:02.360 --> 24:05.720]  majority portion of the bytes that get downloaded on the page for you go to the
[24:05.720 --> 24:09.520]  ad I think looking at that as a percentage is kind of unfair just
[24:09.520 --> 24:12.720]  because of the design of daring fireball but if you really want to look at it
[24:12.720 --> 24:17.720]  that way okay fine I say go ahead block the ads you know but I don't think a lot
[24:17.720 --> 24:21.400]  of people feel that way I think people the thing that's opening people's eyes
[24:21.400 --> 24:27.440]  with this with with the content blocking are the performance numbers that people
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.680]  are seeing yeah I think when I see people whose eyes have been opened by
[24:30.680 --> 24:33.820]  like some of the stuff like that Ben Brooks has been publishing what he's you
[24:33.820 --> 24:39.120]  know doing the yeoman's work of testing all these things and the New York Times
[24:39.120 --> 24:42.920]  published a thing today where they they tested a bunch of sites with ad
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.680]  blockers and when you see that you can save 30 seconds on a mobile page view
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.320]  when you go to boston.com by having an ad blocker I don't think it's about
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.280]  blocking ads it's I just want my I want that speed increase yeah and that's
[24:57.280 --> 25:01.480]  that's certainly a major part of it that is a major justification and and a major
[25:01.480 --> 25:05.440]  motivator especially on mobile you know on desktop it was it was easier to get
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.360]  wasteful and kind of ignore it but on mobile it matters more mobile also
[25:09.360 --> 25:12.360]  screen space matters more you know like the ads that would come in and take over
[25:12.360 --> 25:15.940]  a massive chunk of the screen or do these stupid overlays or break when you
[25:15.940 --> 25:22.240]  zoomed in it's so many bad ad things out there but it's a major motivator but I
[25:22.240 --> 25:27.440]  think I think it comes a bit comes down to like if you ask people would you
[25:27.440 --> 25:32.080]  rather see this thing with ads or with no ads they would choose no ads every
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.240]  time you know obviously there's some exceptions like you know like certain
[25:35.240 --> 25:39.240]  magazines or like the ads are kind of the point but for the most part most
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.240]  content I think people if people were given the option to take it with no ads
[25:42.240 --> 25:45.920]  they would take that option you know assuming the cost was equal and probably
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.560]  both free and so what you have in the ad business is this kind of tension this
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.760]  kind of balanced tension well usually it's balanced where the people really
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.280]  want the stuff for free and they don't want to pay they don't want to pay for
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.120]  it and they also don't want to see ads and the publishers you know they
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.800]  obviously can't operate for free so like they say all right well we'll kind of
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.040]  reach this equilibrium like okay well we're gonna show ads and most of you
[26:12.040 --> 26:15.920]  are going to tolerate them and you're gonna tolerate it because you don't want
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.620]  to pay us and it's kind of okay and for the most part both sides that usually
[26:21.620 --> 26:28.040]  it's this it's this at this relationship of tolerating you not actually wanting
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.360]  the ads or enjoying the ads you know most people if given the choice again
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.000]  they would they would say well I don't have to see the ads then don't show them
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.840]  to me or don't waste my time with them so it's always this kind of tension and
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.160]  in in the in the grand scheme of things I think people do like free content
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.320]  better than they like paywalled stuff so ultimately I think I think this is a
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.560]  necessary evil like it's and obviously this is always evil you know but it's a
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.360]  necessary compromise of how content is viewed and paid for and everything and
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.800]  you know I I run the deck ads on my site I run ads on my podcast just like you do
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.480]  on here and that's those are both choices where it's like you know I also
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.800]  you know I I would love to do an ad free podcast where people just paid us but
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.840]  that would make a lot less money I'm gonna reach a lot less people and you
[27:19.840 --> 27:23.000]  know if you put a paywall up in front of a podcast that is just death like
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  nobody listens so it's it's really it's it's never a great relationship it's
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.440]  never perfect you know it's never really what all sides want but it's this
[27:35.440 --> 27:38.760]  compromise that all sides have reached most of the time and anything you do to
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.620]  throw that out of balance like making the ads are really obnoxious or really
[27:43.620 --> 27:47.000]  creepy or really overreaching or really slow or have other major problems
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.060]  there's gonna be pushback from that but the basic the basic notion of you I'm
[27:54.060 --> 27:57.540]  gonna show you ads and you're gonna tolerate them it's there it's a little
[27:57.540 --> 28:01.720]  bit uncomfortable even from the start you know and it's I've always I've
[28:01.720 --> 28:07.280]  always kind of felt mildly irritated by the fact that I that I make my living on
[28:07.280 --> 28:13.680]  ads because I don't like ads you know but but I think this is the best
[28:13.680 --> 28:16.960]  solution we have given all the variables I think that's where you the comparison
[28:16.960 --> 28:25.440]  to piracy works as I've always seen piracy as a negotiation it is you know
[28:25.440 --> 28:33.200]  somebody if they're pirating an app or a game they're you know that whoever makes
[28:33.200 --> 28:39.320]  the game is saying here it's here's a new game for your PC it's $40 and the
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.800]  person who pirates it instead of paying for it is saying no it's $0 and at some
[28:44.800 --> 28:49.280]  point and I know that you know with piracy there are absolute die-hards you
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.480]  know and there are people you know kids I when I was you know in college I
[28:52.480 --> 28:58.940]  pirated all sorts of stuff and it wasn't wasn't like if Adobe had to have to the
[28:58.940 --> 29:04.400]  price of Photoshop I was gonna pay for it instead of pirating it I realized
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.140]  that but you know for some things at some point it's it and I think that that
[29:09.140 --> 29:15.720]  was the key to the iTunes music store making online music a success is that it
[29:15.720 --> 29:20.120]  they they were saying here's a better deal we'll have all the music you'll get
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.540]  your album art it'll all have good metadata right there you you'll be sure
[29:23.540 --> 29:30.240]  of the quality and it's a fair price 99 cents and did it stop music piracy no
[29:30.240 --> 29:33.680]  definitely not but it definitely turned some people who might have otherwise or
[29:33.680 --> 29:38.400]  previously been using Napster or you know whatever the you know the stuff
[29:38.400 --> 29:41.600]  that came after Napster was to instead just say you know what I'll just buy it
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.100]  from iTunes it's a negotiation I think what you see and it's the same thing
[29:46.100 --> 29:49.600]  with a lot of piracy and you see it with the entertainment industry and the way
[29:49.600 --> 29:56.360]  they approach movies and stuff like that and and music and games and software and
[29:56.360 --> 29:59.000]  I think it's very true with the advertising industry is that the
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.120]  industry the publishers and the advertisers or the entertainment
[30:03.120 --> 30:06.680]  companies they don't see it as a negotiation they see this as a problem
[30:06.680 --> 30:11.400]  that could be solved so that they can do whatever they want and them the people
[30:11.400 --> 30:17.000]  will just take it we can we can show you whatever online ads we want and you'll
[30:17.000 --> 30:22.400]  just suck it up at that and that there's some you know I'm sure that the there's
[30:22.400 --> 30:26.640]  a whole bunch of people who are if they're looking at Wow our mobile
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.560]  numbers are down this month you know this iOS content blocking thing is
[30:30.560 --> 30:36.600]  totally real it's you can see it here you know five six seven percent down you
[30:36.600 --> 30:42.520]  know over where we were before this came out you know that there's people right
[30:42.520 --> 30:46.280]  now who's who are thinking or who are demanding of their engineering teams
[30:46.280 --> 30:51.240]  find a way around this so not not like how do we you know how do we start
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.360]  selling ads that people don't want to block it's how do we defeat the content
[30:55.360 --> 31:00.520]  blockers and you know I think that's the wrong attitude that's not that's not
[31:00.520 --> 31:12.120]  gonna win exactly so right but buddy on the other side when they make new kinds
[31:12.120 --> 31:16.640]  of ads then the ad blocker people are gonna say well now we need to block this
[31:16.640 --> 31:20.800]  new kind of ad like the neither side is willing to agree to the other side's
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.280]  terms here like the the advertiser is not gonna say well I guess we better
[31:24.280 --> 31:29.200]  stop polishing ads because nobody likes ads and the ad blockers aren't gonna say
[31:29.200 --> 31:33.360]  well you know what that ad is fine we're gonna publish that one because if they
[31:33.360 --> 31:39.620]  do the users revolt and they go to something else so I don't know what the
[31:39.620 --> 31:44.360]  ultimate solution is but it's it's absolutely some form of having a basic
[31:44.360 --> 31:49.080]  respect for the user and for your product and I've been saying the
[31:49.080 --> 31:53.960]  following for years as well is to me as somebody who's always been sort of
[31:53.960 --> 31:58.800]  obsessed by publishing and advertising and graphic design and branding and
[31:58.800 --> 32:05.960]  things like this whether it's you know print or TV or online it has always been
[32:05.960 --> 32:10.120]  right from the very get-go it has always been very clear to me that the
[32:10.120 --> 32:16.040]  traditional companies either from TV or from print when they went online by and
[32:16.040 --> 32:20.920]  large they had very little to no respect for the web they either treated it as
[32:20.920 --> 32:25.360]  like at some point they had to stop treating it as as maybe a fad but
[32:25.360 --> 32:30.120]  clearly at the beginning a lot of them thought maybe this is a fad and they
[32:30.120 --> 32:34.760]  never ever treated it with the respect that they treat their main products you
[32:34.760 --> 32:41.080]  know they would never put a pop-up that actually covered the actors faces faces
[32:41.080 --> 32:45.920]  on a TV show right wherever you want to say about you know even when they put
[32:45.920 --> 32:49.200]  they do some stuff that still annoys me on TV like where they'll put little
[32:49.200 --> 32:52.760]  things up at the bottom of the screen but they don't do something that covers
[32:52.760 --> 32:58.960]  the actual whole content of the show while the show is playing magazines
[32:58.960 --> 33:04.440]  don't allow advertisers to make ads that like tape pages well they're getting
[33:04.440 --> 33:08.640]  worse every year with that well now that print is getting desperate they it might
[33:08.640 --> 33:11.880]  be out of desperation but certainly while they were profitable they wouldn't
[33:11.880 --> 33:15.560]  do it they wouldn't make you like let's say a popular page like the the op-ed
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.080]  page in the New York Times they weren't going to seal that with some kind of
[33:19.080 --> 33:23.760]  tape so that you have to sit there and spend 30 seconds looking at the whatever
[33:23.760 --> 33:28.920]  logo is on the tape while you carefully cut across it to do it but they've
[33:28.920 --> 33:35.800]  treated online ads like that all along give it time I really do but here's the
[33:35.800 --> 33:39.560]  thing I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna tell you yeah I feel like I have to
[33:39.560 --> 33:45.080]  explain why I thought you shouldn't have taken peace out of the store and at the
[33:45.080 --> 33:49.840]  time I didn't realize that having read your piece your your your article
[33:49.840 --> 33:52.720]  explaining it I would have said okay you're right if that's what you feel
[33:52.720 --> 33:55.920]  then just get out I didn't know when you called me I didn't know what you were
[33:55.920 --> 34:02.640]  thinking the problem was I think the idea of that once it was out and once
[34:02.640 --> 34:07.480]  you saw that this was you know that there was controversy to be had and
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.640]  arguments to be made and that it was going to be a non-stop never never-ending
[34:11.640 --> 34:17.000]  slog of what deserves to be blocked and what doesn't the realization that he
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.200]  didn't want to be in this business was you know I think it's the right call I
[34:21.200 --> 34:24.840]  didn't know that that's what you were thinking I also think that this is why
[34:24.840 --> 34:28.400]  you're still getting shit from people out in the internet is the because I
[34:28.400 --> 34:33.640]  have seen this where there are people who you know are like lol and at how
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.360]  could you build a content blocker all summer long and not imagine what it was
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.280]  like to have a content blocker I can imagine that very easily that you didn't
[34:43.280 --> 34:47.400]  really think about it I thought your explanation here's a cool API I'd like
[34:47.400 --> 34:51.720]  to build one myself I like to build things so I'll build a thing and you
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.680]  don't think pass that exactly that was that was really it it's like you know I
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.240]  explained all about it on ATP it's like all summer long I was focused on how to
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.320]  make a really cool app using this stuff and I I was not focusing on what will
[35:05.320 --> 35:11.240]  it actually be like if I make this cool app succeed and become a major person
[35:11.240 --> 35:15.480]  influential in this business and having everyone look at me this way and I
[35:15.480 --> 35:20.960]  didn't think about that you know I should have but I was naive and I I
[35:20.960 --> 35:25.640]  wanted to do the cool thing where I make the cool app and then you know I didn't
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.760]  you know it didn't really matter what the app did I just I want I had this
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.000]  cool app idea and I I tried it and it worked really well and so I I was
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.640]  motivated to keep going with it and I just didn't think about you know what
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.480]  would happen and you know I mean a lot about this is a lot of the a lot of the
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.640]  frustration and anger that I've received over it from other people is really
[35:46.640 --> 35:52.640]  about like you know they they just can't believe that this that I got to that
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.080]  position and that I then gave it up for very so that that's one of the reasons
[35:57.080 --> 35:59.840]  you know one of the other reasons is like how do you walk away from all that
[35:59.840 --> 36:02.540]  money and it's you know it's like well you know money isn't everything and I
[36:02.540 --> 36:11.520]  felt bad about it cetera and I mean just once I decided to to take it off the
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.160]  store and and I I just when I had it once I decided that he like you said
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.880]  you're at the dentist it was the the moment I decided oh I should stop the
[36:20.880 --> 36:26.280]  store it was like 1030 in the morning it was down by 1230 it was it was like two
[36:26.280 --> 36:30.720]  hours like all I had to do was I I talked it over with my wife I ran it by
[36:30.720 --> 36:33.940]  you and I ran it by the ghost tree people to make sure that I even could do
[36:33.940 --> 36:37.440]  it without breaking the contract and and that they weren't gonna be you know
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.640]  horribly mad about it and that was it I was like you know what yeah I want to do
[36:41.640 --> 36:44.840]  this I'm done like as soon as I even had the idea to do it I felt a million times
[36:44.840 --> 36:50.480]  better like I it was like this giant weight off my shoulders and that night
[36:50.480 --> 36:53.640]  when I was working on overcast again for the first time in a couple of weeks it
[36:53.640 --> 37:00.760]  felt so good because overcast will probably not make in its entire next
[37:00.760 --> 37:08.240]  year what peace could make in two or three days but it's funny because so
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.480]  much better about it you know and it you and I have talked about this that one of
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.880]  the things some people have a very hard time believing is that anybody obviously
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.360]  I don't think everybody thinks this way I don't think a majority but there are
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.760]  clearly some people who cannot get it through their heads that pure money is
[37:26.760 --> 37:33.960]  not a primary motivating factor for us it's great I am successful right now and
[37:33.960 --> 37:37.920]  I do appreciate that and it's important to me because I have a family and so it
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.120]  is certainly a significant motivator and it is a very high priority for me but
[37:43.120 --> 37:47.520]  it's not number one and maximizing it getting every single dollar that I can
[37:47.520 --> 37:53.520]  absolutely positively is not it's number one motivator for me is is dupe you
[37:53.520 --> 37:57.520]  know professionally is doing good work that I'm proud of and number two is
[37:57.520 --> 38:01.120]  probably like just what I feel like is the overall quality of my life am I
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.720]  happy money obviously plays a factor in that but you know making the most money
[38:05.720 --> 38:09.480]  possible definitely doesn't right and you know you and I are both fortunate
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.000]  that you and I have made enough money and make make enough money through other
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.600]  means that like we can say no to things that don't feel right to us and and you
[38:19.600 --> 38:22.840]  know there's there's all these studies done like you know every there's a
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.760]  threshold for everybody and and it's surprisingly low where additional money
[38:27.760 --> 38:31.940]  that you make above that threshold doesn't really make you happier you know
[38:31.940 --> 38:37.220]  so there is this concept of like what is enough and in most cultures that aren't
[38:37.220 --> 38:41.760]  Americans that number is way lower but even Americans have you know this
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.520]  concept of what is enough beyond which it stops really adding to your happiness
[38:46.520 --> 38:50.960]  in in a proportional way and I've heard estimates of that number being as low as
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.100]  like seventy five thousand dollars a year which you know for in the software
[38:55.100 --> 38:59.660]  business is a pretty mid range to low salary so like it's pretty for people
[38:59.660 --> 39:02.660]  who are like listening to the show it's not that hard to achieve that you know
[39:02.660 --> 39:07.460]  it isn't that unheard of so the idea that that you that you know if you
[39:07.460 --> 39:12.360]  already make a six-figure salary and you know the idea that you could turn away
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.240]  money from something that you that makes you feel terrible that actually there's
[39:18.240 --> 39:23.960]  a lot of like widespread you know surveys and and psychology and stuff to
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.080]  back that up where yeah that actually is plausible to do and in fact people do it
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.560]  frequently like that you know once once you once you've reached a certain level
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.080]  of income you don't just you don't have to say yes to everything and in fact if
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.700]  you and a lot of people choose poorly on that scale and say yes to everything and
[39:41.700 --> 39:45.100]  are miserable for it and they don't necessarily realize that like you know
[39:45.100 --> 39:48.660]  they don't have to do that yeah and there's a lot of people who you know
[39:48.660 --> 39:52.740]  you're you know people who do it not just because they're well off enough and
[39:52.740 --> 39:56.060]  they can keep their life so people who downgrade their lifestyle and are
[39:56.060 --> 40:00.500]  delighted by it you know somebody who is just killing themselves in a corporate
[40:00.500 --> 40:06.260]  attorney job you know 100 some hours a week doing this mind-numbing work and
[40:06.260 --> 40:12.260]  then they leave and become you know a teacher or something yeah or like you
[40:12.260 --> 40:15.160]  know you take a job with that has a much shorter commute that's way closer to
[40:15.160 --> 40:18.320]  your house even if it pays less than the job that's all the way in the city
[40:18.320 --> 40:22.760]  you're way happier taking the job that's a shorter commute and you're and it's
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.420]  you're able to rationally say yes I can turn down the extra money for the job in
[40:26.420 --> 40:30.440]  the city because I will be way happier and probably healthier and probably have
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.140]  a better family life if I if I choose this one right it's the same kind of
[40:34.140 --> 40:38.580]  thing that all plays in there are somebody who leaves a six-figure
[40:38.580 --> 40:43.340]  engineering job at Apple or any of the you know big companies out there and it
[40:43.340 --> 40:46.980]  just opens up their own coffee shop which is an entire you know opening up
[40:46.980 --> 40:53.160]  a restaurant notoriously low-margin difficult business to be in but that all
[40:53.160 --> 40:56.840]  they've ever wanted to do is roast their own coffee and make a cool place you
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.780]  know where people can hang out you know and if that's what you want to do I mean
[41:01.780 --> 41:05.580]  that could be so much happier and you're making way less money way less but
[41:05.580 --> 41:08.620]  anyway that's it's people don't think I'll give you a concrete example of
[41:08.620 --> 41:13.180]  money that I have passed up and it's I don't think it's a thing it certainly
[41:13.180 --> 41:16.380]  wasn't sustainable I think Google's search algorithms have gotten around it
[41:16.380 --> 41:21.500]  but at some point in the late last decade I would I'm gonna guess that it
[41:21.500 --> 41:29.780]  peaked somewhere around 2008 to 2010 or so it was a non-stop barrage every week
[41:29.780 --> 41:36.500]  where I got offers from people to place text ads on daring fireball oh yeah the
[41:36.500 --> 41:39.940]  big text ad thing yep either they wanted them on the home page or it would you
[41:39.940 --> 41:44.180]  know it would be some specific page that ranked highly for a certain keyword a
[41:44.180 --> 41:49.460]  post that I had written and they would offer thousands of dollars I mean and I
[41:49.460 --> 41:52.540]  remember one time it was it was a guy and I actually pursued it not because I
[41:52.540 --> 41:56.540]  thought I would take it but I honestly it was like something like $20,000 for I
[41:56.540 --> 42:01.060]  don't know a couple of months and it just seemed like such a large amount of
[42:01.060 --> 42:04.580]  money but the I just wanted to see is this a scam this is a scam but then I
[42:04.580 --> 42:07.540]  thought how can it be a scam because if I don't get the money I'm gonna take the
[42:07.540 --> 42:12.340]  text ad down and it's you know it's the and I thought well maybe the scam is
[42:12.340 --> 42:16.380]  that they think that Google will index at once and I was like no it can't be
[42:16.380 --> 42:19.780]  because this is an article like let's say a year-old article if they think
[42:19.780 --> 42:23.540]  that there's value to be gained by putting a text ad there now they must
[42:23.540 --> 42:28.300]  know that Google re indexes these pages and so therefore they must know that if
[42:28.300 --> 42:32.900]  I take the text ad down that it'll reindex and they won't have that Google
[42:32.900 --> 42:36.220]  juice you know and I just researched the company and it really seemed like yes
[42:36.220 --> 42:40.340]  this is a company that pays publishers tens of thousands of dollars to place
[42:40.340 --> 42:43.700]  these text ads and then you could do things they didn't even care all they
[42:43.700 --> 42:47.660]  cared about was the search engines and you you could do things like use CSS to
[42:47.660 --> 42:52.940]  make it display none or or fixed position at 4,000 pixels off-screen
[42:52.940 --> 42:56.580]  whatever you wanted they didn't care so it wasn't like anybody would know it
[42:56.580 --> 43:01.260]  wasn't like anybody would see it but it was thousands of dollars from just
[43:01.260 --> 43:06.860]  non-stop for years and I say no to all of them or or or the other thing I would
[43:06.860 --> 43:10.420]  do is I would write back and they would be like what they would a lot of them
[43:10.420 --> 43:14.180]  would say what is what would you want how much would you want for me to put a
[43:14.180 --> 43:21.700]  text ad on a page and I would write back you know $100,000 and then they would
[43:21.700 --> 43:24.780]  say that's too much I you know you're I you know because they're looking at like
[43:24.780 --> 43:29.260]  Alexa numbers or something to gauge my traffic but before I got to like
[43:29.260 --> 43:32.420]  ridiculous numbers like that I would offer you know I remember I would write
[43:32.420 --> 43:36.840]  back as a joke and just say like $10,000 and they'd be like well how about seven
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.540]  I'd be like oh shit yeah it's like you thought you were throwing out this
[43:41.540 --> 43:44.640]  obscene number that they would laugh at right and they were actually like yeah
[43:44.640 --> 43:51.460]  that's pretty close actually yeah we can do that now these are ads that weren't
[43:51.460 --> 43:55.580]  all they wanted was the text all they wanted to do was trick Google and other
[43:55.580 --> 43:59.280]  search indexes there was no major industry for a while I think I think
[43:59.280 --> 44:03.000]  it's finally probably died down as Google got smarter but that was a major
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.960]  industry it was a major industry and the money was truly significant I mean I
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.100]  don't know what I could have if I had pursued it but easily tens of thousands
[44:11.100 --> 44:14.940]  a month yeah I ran those like a backward market that I work had like a hundred
[44:14.940 --> 44:18.660]  visitors a month I ran those from a company called text link ads it was like
[44:18.660 --> 44:21.000]  text link ads with hyphens in it and that was the company name they might
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.820]  even still be around I'm sure they've been bought a million times I don't
[44:23.820 --> 44:27.600]  think I think text link ads were I think that in particular they were they weren't
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.060]  so scammy they know it was very it was very similar like you you embedded this
[44:32.060 --> 44:36.620]  PHP things I remember I even I was still very into PHP at the time but but I even
[44:36.620 --> 44:40.620]  modified the code to add nofollow to the links and I think that eventually got me
[44:40.620 --> 44:44.260]  kicked out but because I was aware of what they were doing and I was like well
[44:44.260 --> 44:47.700]  you know I'm gonna add nofollow because that's the that's the right thing to do
[44:47.700 --> 44:51.500]  and they didn't have an explicit rule against it that I could find at the time
[44:51.500 --> 44:56.260]  I wrote that code but this wasn't doing any tracking it wasn't going to I mean
[44:56.260 --> 45:00.980]  literally there was just HTML so it wasn't even going to have any measurable
[45:00.980 --> 45:05.060]  effect on download size we're talking about not even kilobytes but bytes
[45:05.060 --> 45:09.420]  actual just extra bytes right although it would if it loaded synchronously
[45:09.420 --> 45:12.780]  which it would have had to do what they wanted with Google it would block the
[45:12.780 --> 45:16.700]  page load while it fetched it on your server side I don't even think I think
[45:16.700 --> 45:19.820]  they just wanted me to actually just paste here paste this little snippet of
[45:19.820 --> 45:24.140]  HTML oh the article it wasn't even dynamic no wasn't even dynamic most of
[45:24.140 --> 45:27.660]  the offers now I think that there were some services like text link ads where
[45:27.660 --> 45:31.060]  it was dynamic because they wanted to yeah but I used to feel these offers from
[45:31.060 --> 45:36.020]  people who just wanted to buy a month of you know just put this snippet of HTML
[45:36.020 --> 45:42.340]  in this article for a month you know for you know significant money and I didn't
[45:42.340 --> 45:45.660]  do it I turned it down because it just felt gross and it just and and I didn't
[45:45.660 --> 45:49.380]  need it I do have to admit because you know the the whole RSS sponsorship thing
[45:49.380 --> 45:53.340]  that at this point was taking off and it was doing well and the deck was you know
[45:53.340 --> 45:56.820]  I was already in the deck so I didn't need it I was already at the point where
[45:56.820 --> 46:00.580]  I could say during fireball is you know supporting my family I don't need to
[46:00.580 --> 46:04.580]  pile this on with things that I'm not proud of and exactly like you know so I
[46:04.580 --> 46:09.300]  didn't but there are you know there's other examples I've fielded offers from
[46:09.300 --> 46:14.580]  people you know like you know other ad networks you know effectively I would
[46:14.580 --> 46:17.820]  have had to quit the deck and go to them who offered me way more than the deck
[46:17.820 --> 46:23.820]  you know has ever paid me per month and you know I just said no to all of them
[46:23.820 --> 46:28.900]  because I it just dancing around switching ad networks and going to the
[46:28.900 --> 46:32.180]  highest bidder and look and their ads obviously they were did just weren't
[46:32.180 --> 46:36.300]  they weren't little nice static ads like the deck they were big and ugly
[46:36.300 --> 46:40.140]  really the standard IAB big rectangles and everything I mean the idea of
[46:40.140 --> 46:45.140]  looking like the deck has this amazing lock-in because once once you are
[46:45.140 --> 46:48.460]  accustomed to the way your own site looks with the deck and once your
[46:48.460 --> 46:52.820]  readers are accustomed to a your site looks at the deck you just imagine what
[46:52.820 --> 46:55.620]  your site would look like with this with the giant like skyscraper out on the
[46:55.620 --> 46:59.820]  sidebar like the regular like bit like a big white like that would look
[46:59.820 --> 47:04.300]  horrendous like it wouldn't look like your site at all it would look like it
[47:04.300 --> 47:07.620]  would look like you were like on some crazy Wi-Fi that was like injecting ads
[47:07.620 --> 47:11.580]  into every page you visited like it would look like a scam or malware had
[47:11.580 --> 47:14.860]  taken over or something it would you wouldn't you would never say oh that's
[47:14.860 --> 47:18.100]  during fireball that's normal like and you know it that's what goes to show I
[47:18.100 --> 47:22.260]  think like the different worlds that that are possible here in the
[47:22.260 --> 47:25.740]  advertising space like you have you know fully native stuff like your RSS
[47:25.740 --> 47:29.420]  sponsorships that are now everyone's doing then the podcast do then you have
[47:29.420 --> 47:35.220]  like the the very very subtle model like what the deck does and then you have
[47:35.220 --> 47:42.780]  everything else it's mostly like these giant horrible things and and I do think
[47:42.780 --> 47:46.980]  but I can say I can say for certainty that it wasn't like the other ones that
[47:46.980 --> 47:50.900]  would come to me were offering me well it would be 25% more than the deck or 30
[47:50.900 --> 47:54.140]  it wasn't like a percentage more it was a factor of like three four five times
[47:54.140 --> 47:57.180]  more like five times more than what I was making from the deck it was
[47:57.180 --> 48:01.000]  significant money the way I always chalked it up and I and Amy completely
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.500]  supported me on this is that to me the money that I was leaving on the table by
[48:05.500 --> 48:09.700]  not using those ads was effectively in investing in the brand of daring
[48:09.700 --> 48:14.540]  fireball yeah that's totally right I mean because your site has always had
[48:14.540 --> 48:19.220]  that look it's always even even in the age now where you know you might want to
[48:19.220 --> 48:22.660]  consider a mobile layout and a bigger font someday maybe but you know your
[48:22.660 --> 48:27.780]  site has always had this look and that that definitely does help it definitely
[48:27.780 --> 48:31.620]  it definitely does contribute it makes your site look higher class more
[48:31.620 --> 48:35.020]  valuable certainly it's much more pleasant to read as long as you hit the
[48:35.020 --> 48:39.180]  plus button a few times on the keyboard it is it is very it very much
[48:39.180 --> 48:44.020]  contributes you know if you go to slash prefs you'll get a little prefer it's
[48:44.020 --> 48:47.220]  actually there used to be multiple press which is why I do that on my devices
[48:47.220 --> 48:52.460]  and so do you think by iCloud I doubt it no that's a cookie on your device but
[48:52.460 --> 48:55.740]  anybody who doesn't know this you can go to during fireball dotnet slash prefs
[48:55.740 --> 48:59.980]  and you can set the font size and it'll save it in a cookie on that device yeah
[48:59.980 --> 49:03.660]  you know maybe maybe I should get to you sometime and make you finally update
[49:03.660 --> 49:08.340]  your font it'll add a responsive layout maybe well you know what though all
[49:08.340 --> 49:14.780]  right not to it's we can keep going on this I wanted a sponsor break but one of
[49:14.780 --> 49:20.900]  the things that if I do even when I do I want to change it once I want to change
[49:20.900 --> 49:26.740]  the layout to during fireball I once and then have it last at least another 15 to
[49:26.740 --> 49:35.380]  20 years no pressure well I the last design you know has gone close to what
[49:35.380 --> 49:40.060]  so I changed it like 2003 or 2004 there wasn't early there's like a for the
[49:40.060 --> 49:46.420]  first year during fireball is a slightly different design so 11 years I feel like
[49:46.420 --> 49:50.100]  I could get one that goes for 15 and maybe I'll need to tweak it like I have
[49:50.100 --> 49:54.800]  this one you know here and there subtly over the years but you know I want to do
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.460]  it once but to do it once I think it would require web fonts and I've
[50:00.460 --> 50:04.860]  procrastinated for years on web fonts because I just can't get over the fact
[50:04.860 --> 50:08.420]  that to me they feel a little slow and one of the things that I really love
[50:08.420 --> 50:11.420]  about during fireball is how fast is one of my favorite things I get from people
[50:11.420 --> 50:15.580]  from email or tweets or something like that is every once in a while like if
[50:15.580 --> 50:23.700]  during fireball does go down or if there's like a DNS outage on the net
[50:23.700 --> 50:27.620]  which makes really weird things and it's like some people you know like people
[50:27.620 --> 50:30.620]  say hey is during fireball down and I check and it's definitely not down it's
[50:30.620 --> 50:34.380]  right there really fast but I keep I get like three or four of these it's usually
[50:34.380 --> 50:39.140]  like a DNS problem and people who are somewhere on some chunk of the internet
[50:39.140 --> 50:43.500]  can't get there and when people say the following to me it always makes my day
[50:43.500 --> 50:46.680]  they say daring fireball isn't just one of my favorite sites it's also the thing
[50:46.680 --> 50:51.340]  I always go to when I want to check my internet connection that's great yeah
[50:51.340 --> 50:55.620]  but they expect that it's always up and they expect it to load like instantly
[50:55.620 --> 51:01.020]  and web fonts definitely change that so I've put off on that you know and and
[51:01.020 --> 51:03.820]  that's funny because with the content bloggers a lot of them have an option to
[51:03.820 --> 51:08.100]  block web fonts specifically just just to make things faster not because
[51:08.100 --> 51:12.420]  anybody's really opposed to nobody's opposed to good-looking font and nobody's
[51:12.420 --> 51:20.820]  opposed to nice design but people some people favor fast page loads over you
[51:20.820 --> 51:24.880]  know pristine designer however what you want to put it yeah I mean I was I was
[51:24.880 --> 51:27.860]  doing that in from the early builds a piece that was like one of the very
[51:27.860 --> 51:31.580]  first things I built was I built one that blocked all third-party JavaScript
[51:31.580 --> 51:36.480]  which was insane but worked and and I and it had an option to block all web
[51:36.480 --> 51:42.140]  fonts and it broke my site it broke a lot of other sites but it was so much
[51:42.140 --> 51:46.660]  faster like it it was a massive speed difference and so now like as much as I
[51:46.660 --> 51:52.060]  love the this wonderful hfj ideal sans font that I use on my site and and you
[51:52.060 --> 51:55.300]  know as far as I know like I've seen a couple of benchmarks here and there that
[51:55.300 --> 52:00.180]  suggests that the hfj web fonts are not as fast as typekit but either way
[52:00.180 --> 52:04.100]  neither none of them are what I would call fast enough you know like that
[52:04.100 --> 52:09.300]  you're still loading a few hundred kilobytes of fonts for most people that
[52:09.300 --> 52:13.540]  you know and it's from some other CDN that is off off hosts so it's like
[52:13.540 --> 52:16.860]  making another connection and everything and another opportunity for weird
[52:16.860 --> 52:22.660]  latency or DNS issues and you know the fact is web fonts are really nice
[52:22.660 --> 52:27.660]  they're they're very much like a nice to have but if they're gonna come at a big
[52:27.660 --> 52:31.460]  cost they're probably not worth it for most sites and what I found when I would
[52:31.460 --> 52:34.780]  like when I would when I've been browsing with with web fonts disabled on
[52:34.780 --> 52:38.860]  my phone for for a while now and even with ghostry on the desktop I would I
[52:38.860 --> 52:41.780]  would turn off typekit because that's one of their trackers that they that
[52:41.780 --> 52:46.820]  they can block I've been doing that for a couple months too and you really don't
[52:46.820 --> 52:50.900]  miss much like it's you know you you can tell on certain sites where like they
[52:50.900 --> 52:53.980]  didn't have a good fallback so it defaults like Times New Roman you could
[52:53.980 --> 52:57.740]  you know you can tell like oh this wasn't supposed to look like times but
[52:57.740 --> 53:04.180]  for the most part things load really fast and nothing looks that bad and many
[53:04.180 --> 53:08.580]  times it looks pretty good because if it falls back to something sensible so you
[53:08.580 --> 53:14.620]  know I would say if if I redesign my site anytime soon I would almost
[53:14.620 --> 53:19.020]  certainly go back to a regular system font and not use any more web fonts just
[53:19.020 --> 53:23.100]  for speed because it just isn't worth it and that being said in defense of your
[53:23.100 --> 53:29.220]  ancient site design I will say that that a couple months ago I I decided to to be
[53:29.220 --> 53:36.260]  a smartass and to try to try to like just write like ten lines of CSS or
[53:36.260 --> 53:40.740]  whatever that I could just like text you and have you inject it in your template
[53:40.740 --> 53:44.260]  like here's your here's your freaking responsive layout here like here just
[53:44.260 --> 53:47.380]  modernize your site with this little thing I just wrote in an hour so that
[53:47.380 --> 53:51.540]  was my plan I was gonna do this and I tried I started and your site is
[53:51.540 --> 53:56.500]  surprisingly complex like I I tried doing that and realized it was gonna be
[53:56.500 --> 54:00.940]  way more work than than what I had planned for this is a common theme with
[54:00.940 --> 54:06.660]  me way more work and I was like yeah okay now I understand why you haven't
[54:06.660 --> 54:10.420]  done this yet yeah that's a pretty bit well I mean it's been so long that I
[54:10.420 --> 54:13.420]  don't really have an excuse but well I you've probably started it like ten
[54:13.420 --> 54:18.500]  times yeah that's a lot of boring backstories there but it'll happen
[54:18.500 --> 54:22.860]  sooner or later but yeah there's no way to just take the current HTML and easily
[54:22.860 --> 54:27.300]  do it I mean you can make a new one that looks that that on the widescreen looks
[54:27.300 --> 54:30.700]  the same but the the way that everything is structured right now is actually sort
[54:30.700 --> 54:37.580]  of fights against responsive layout it'll happen well the other thing
[54:37.580 --> 54:40.780]  probably the worst thing that ever happened was the fact that with a very
[54:40.780 --> 54:48.180]  very short amount of I think it's just like that one viewport meta tag and the
[54:48.180 --> 54:53.180]  fact that a double tap on the main text column is pretty good and it has been
[54:53.180 --> 54:58.720]  since the original iPhone in 2007 I mean like two lines of code in 2007 made it
[54:58.720 --> 55:02.300]  easy to just double tap on the center column of text and have it reason of you
[55:02.300 --> 55:05.900]  know pretty good size and a pretty good width it's not nice and fixed so that
[55:05.900 --> 55:10.700]  you can use you can still slide around sideways when you scroll but it's
[55:10.700 --> 55:16.580]  actually pretty good for a you know for a non mobile optimized layout and that's
[55:16.580 --> 55:19.540]  probably the worst thing that ever happened because if it had been terrible
[55:19.540 --> 55:25.500]  on iPhone I would have done something in 2007 or 2008 yeah I mean and that's I
[55:25.500 --> 55:29.980]  mean your site works the way every site worked in 2007 you know and it's this
[55:29.980 --> 55:32.980]  was the problem that I created instapaper to solve like it one of the
[55:32.980 --> 55:36.460]  problems is like I didn't want to keep zooming in on everyone's pages and then
[55:36.460 --> 55:39.500]  like I would scroll scroll scroll as I was reading and I accidentally get
[55:39.500 --> 55:43.420]  misaligned a little bit side to side and then I let me try to realign back to the
[55:43.420 --> 55:46.900]  center column and ever quite get it right have to zoom back out zoom back in because
[55:46.900 --> 55:53.460]  I'm you know just retentive like that and I I talked to a couple of people
[55:53.460 --> 55:58.420]  about a year ago with this like I think if I was designing instapaper from
[55:58.420 --> 56:02.220]  scratch today like if I was designing a thing that would solve this problem from
[56:02.220 --> 56:07.300]  scratch today I don't think I would do the text view I think I would just save
[56:07.300 --> 56:11.300]  what was there on the page like the full layout because responsive design and
[56:11.300 --> 56:17.180]  and modern sensible design on most of the sites that I want to read and
[56:17.180 --> 56:19.620]  especially now with content blockers existing if there was a way to hook
[56:19.620 --> 56:24.380]  into that kind of system responsive design really solved the the problem
[56:24.380 --> 56:29.140]  pretty well most of the time like these like back in 2007 2008 when I was
[56:29.140 --> 56:34.220]  designing instapaper at first the text view was necessary because no sites had
[56:34.220 --> 56:39.460]  mobile layouts responsive design didn't even exist yet like the the spec wasn't
[56:39.460 --> 56:42.140]  even there like the media queries I don't think even existed back then or at
[56:42.140 --> 56:45.980]  least we're not widely supported so like you couldn't do responsive design back
[56:45.980 --> 56:52.300]  then but that has really removed a lot of the need for things like instapapers
[56:52.300 --> 56:56.820]  text view and safaris reader view yeah prior to the iPhone the only thing that
[56:56.820 --> 57:01.420]  had ever been done in web standards for mobile were completely different sites
[57:01.420 --> 57:05.980]  WAP I guess was the big one you know WAP I don't even know what it stood for but
[57:05.980 --> 57:11.980]  that it was so that the devices pre iPhone were so primitive computationally
[57:11.980 --> 57:15.900]  and and displays were so small that it wasn't even feasible nobody had even
[57:15.900 --> 57:20.260]  really considered how would we make a dynamic layout that this you could just
[57:20.260 --> 57:24.980]  have one URL one web page and it would look this way on a big monitor this way
[57:24.980 --> 57:29.980]  on a smaller monitor and this way on a on a tiny little phone nobody had even
[57:29.980 --> 57:33.140]  thought about that and that's why you still have sites today that have like
[57:33.140 --> 57:37.900]  mobile dot blah blah blah URLs that don't redirect well and yeah but that's
[57:37.900 --> 57:40.860]  a little different because they usually don't go to like a WAP type site but
[57:40.860 --> 57:44.580]  still there and still annoying but anyway let me take a break here I got to
[57:44.580 --> 57:49.280]  thank our first sponsor and this is a good one so so don't skip ahead this is
[57:49.280 --> 57:56.860]  gonna be a good a good read it's the brawler group B R A W E R now they
[57:56.860 --> 58:00.460]  sponsored during fireball before I think they actually actually sponsored the
[58:00.460 --> 58:04.780]  talk show too and it was a great success so they're back to announce these are
[58:04.780 --> 58:09.640]  the guys behind an app called is a Mac app called you bar just like a lower
[58:09.640 --> 58:16.740]  case you bar you bar three and it implements a ton of suggestions from he
[58:16.740 --> 58:19.820]  even says specifically from listeners at the talk show and readers of daring
[58:19.820 --> 58:24.780]  fireball it's a dock replacement for the Mac the purpose of you bar is to vastly
[58:24.780 --> 58:29.380]  increase your productivity pro users love it but it's also you know it's not
[58:29.380 --> 58:33.300]  just like a pro only tool you can definitely you know see how a normal
[58:33.300 --> 58:40.060]  person in your family would totally get into this and it sort of sort of modeled
[58:40.060 --> 58:44.860]  more on the windows taskbar so if you or anybody in your family has switched from
[58:44.860 --> 58:50.380]  windows and sort of doesn't like the ways that the Mac OS 10 doc isn't like
[58:50.380 --> 58:55.260]  the windows taskbar you bar is exactly the sort of thing you should look at it
[58:55.260 --> 58:59.220]  looks good it's not ugly it's very very cool looking very beautiful it's pure
[58:59.220 --> 59:04.620]  OS 10 style design and it's got for power users tons of shortcuts you can do
[59:04.620 --> 59:09.460]  things like hold down control and you can see the CPU and RAM usage for any of
[59:09.460 --> 59:12.700]  the apps that are in there that are running hold down shift and you can quit
[59:12.700 --> 59:18.180]  any app or close any window from that app just by clicking it apps that are
[59:18.180 --> 59:23.020]  unresponsive get a red background so you can spot hanging apps immediately you
[59:23.020 --> 59:26.540]  don't have to go and launch so it's sort of like it's it's adding features from
[59:26.540 --> 59:32.020]  activity monitor right there in the in the taskbar tons and tons of custom
[59:32.020 --> 59:37.580]  customization you can set the size there's different themes dark and light
[59:37.580 --> 59:42.020]  exactly what you would think you you get the idea when you listen to that you
[59:42.020 --> 59:45.660]  know the idea of this type of app you know there's a lot of customization you
[59:45.660 --> 59:49.260]  can put on any side of any monitor including the top you can pin it to a
[59:49.260 --> 59:56.620]  corner just unbelievable stuff so here's what you do go to you bar app calm and
[59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.660]  they have a four-week trial you can download it start running it you get
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:07.140]  four weeks and the cost is only 20 bucks so this is a great utility typical Mac
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.220]  utility price 20 bucks but and I think they're actually crazy because I think
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.460]  20 bucks is a great price but here's the deal this isn't my idea but they have a
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:21.700]  code retina Gruber r-e-t-i-n-a than my last name retina Gruber I don't know if
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.340]  that's a reference to retina graphics or my eye problems or both but either way
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:29.820]  that's good the way could go either way 50% off so you can get it for just 10
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:34.900]  bucks so you get four weeks to try it and then it's 10 bucks to get it and
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:41.100]  then this is the part that's amazing one more thing the developer of the app his
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.820]  last name is Brower I actually forget his first name let me look it up real
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:52.260]  quick seems like a shame I don't know he has that the app and saw Edward Edward
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.740]  Brower so the app and software development that's his primary that's
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.820]  how he supports himself that's he's a programmer but he has the most amazing
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:09.120]  hobby his hobby is watchmaking he makes real mechanical watches so he's actually
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.540]  launching a new timepiece right here on the show it's called the Mirage it is a
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:19.620]  limited edition of only 300 pieces each with an engraved number on the back he
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:27.380]  has sent one to me it's really really nice I think my number is I forget what
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:33.540]  number I got 104 or something like that really nice dial beautiful typography I
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:41.580]  mean this is like a real serious watch I think here's the price 750 bucks so
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:46.620]  we're talking about this you know this is not like a joke it looks like a $750
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:53.020]  watch it is really really amazing very very nice it has a totally serious strap
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.860]  it's made by a company I'm never going to pronounce this right Camille Fornay
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:04.180]  in Paris it's a lizard like alligator leather strap they make OEM straps for
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:10.620]  actual serious watch companies like Patek Philippe and others it has a the
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.980]  single deployment class single fold deployment class that only means
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.740]  something if you're a watch person but if you are a watch person you know what
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.700]  it means it's really really nice it is like a serious dress watch but you know
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.740]  not so dressy that you couldn't wear it casually so go to for the watch go to
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:36.540]  Brower B R A W E R timepieces.com and the same code works there retina
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:44.740]  grouper and you can get that watch for 40% off so it's $750 watch but you can
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.060]  get it for 40% off using that code shipping is free in the USA and Canada
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.620]  and it comes in a real watch box again if you've ever bought like a fancy watch
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.420]  or like that even like the Apple Edition watches you know that like you know
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.900]  thousand dollar ish watch is supposed to come in a nice box this thing comes in a
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:07.100]  really nice box you the thing that I can't believe it's not that I can't
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.540]  believe that somebody made a nice watch there's lots of nice watches out there I
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:14.780]  just can't believe that this guy designed and made it and did all this
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:19.380]  stuff and you know did all the the machining to actually machine out the
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:23.780]  stainless steel frame of the watch and everything as like his hobby it's
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.700]  absolutely crazy that this is like the second thing that the same guy does who
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:32.900]  makes this amazing you bar up so my thanks to to them for the you bar which
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.840]  is probably something an awful lot of you ought to go look at and maybe buy
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:41.540]  and for the new Mirage watch which probably isn't going to sell to a lot of
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:45.020]  you but for those of you who are into watches it's absolutely positively
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.180]  worth looking at also it's not too big I hate big watches I don't know what I
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.660]  would say if it was real big but it has a diameter of only 40 millimeters so
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:57.780]  it's a perfectly standard not too big watch a woman could get away with it
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.700]  would be like a nice big watch for a woman totally normal size for men comes
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.420]  in three colors white blue and black so my thanks to them check them out is that
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:10.220]  the craziest sponsor that might be one of the craziest sponsors I've ever had
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.140]  that is pretty impressive also I want to give you all my French words to
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:19.060]  pronounce whenever I need that I have no idea if I pronounced that right it's
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:23.100]  not even that hard all right on the ads here's the thing I want to tell you why
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:29.020]  I think you were here's the mistake I think you made with peace and I feel
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.340]  guilty about this because I knew over the summer that you were working on this
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.580]  thing and I I didn't test it until like the night before or something like that
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.580]  and I feel bad that I didn't because I would have I would have called you out
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:45.180]  on the fact that it wasn't white listing the deck or automatically and in fact I
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.300]  was confused because I could swear that the night before when I didn't stall the
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.700]  beta I did the first thing I did was check tearing fireball and I could swear
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:56.700]  that it did show the ad and then you told me that there's some flakiness when
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.580]  you first enable these things and sometimes you have to restart and I
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:05.140]  think that's what I saw I don't want to put words in your mouth but here's what
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:11.500]  I think you were thinking you were thinking I'm not I don't a I don't want
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.420]  to have a whole bunch of fiddly settings so I don't want to have it some of a
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:21.180]  thing that says block block all ads block most ads block half ads just block
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:27.300]  the worst ads I'm just gonna say you know here here's a switch block at and I
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:31.020]  think you were thinking I would be a hypocrite if I white listed the deck
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:37.580]  just because that's what my site is in so I'll do the thing that's not being a
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:43.420]  hypocrite and just include the deck which is mine which is sort of I don't
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:50.420]  know magnanimous I don't know what the word is I I think that by not
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:55.180]  whitelisting the deck you are committing an entirely different form of hypocrisy
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:09.420]  which is that all everything is content and everything that you publish from
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:14.580]  Marco dot org is your your your standing behind so by publishing ads from the
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:18.860]  deck by sending them to your users you're implicitly saying this is an ad
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:24.820]  that's worth your seeing and it's worth your device that you're accessing this
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:30.420]  site downloading and rendering and putting on the page so I feel like you
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:35.180]  you painted yourself into by releasing peace with the deck not being included
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:40.020]  you have two things you've got a website that is implicitly saying this is a
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:45.140]  thing this ad is worth you seeing and is okay and then you have this other thing
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:50.860]  which is saying this is something that should be blocked and there's no way to
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.260]  square that circle yeah that's true I mean that's that was part of the problem
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:01.980]  is that this was this was an unsolvable problem you know it was I can I could
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.420]  say that I no longer want any web ads to exist and I can I could leave the deck I
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:13.340]  could quit the deck and root them from my site I could I could try to
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.860]  distinguish I could try to differentiate I could say well I'm gonna allow
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:21.940]  acceptable ads but we see the problems that causes you know when when other
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.740]  sites try there when other blockers try that we see that that's extremely messy
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:31.540]  and controversial and and I that's you know I didn't want to be in that
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:37.660]  business and you know or I can I can try to differentiate between well I'm gonna
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:43.780]  block ads but not trackers and I said as an ATP to like you can't really make
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.660]  that differentiation because if you want to block tracking you have to block
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:56.380]  almost all ads so it you know and and trying to trying to keep up the list of
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:02.420]  what belongs on the other side of that almost is is very politically charged it
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:08.220]  is very subjective it's very messy and arguable and vague as to what you know
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:13.020]  what kind of ad is okay what kind of ad is safe and is not a tracker what is
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:19.580]  what is tracking include there's it's just it's such a it's such a messy world
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:25.620]  of vague distinctions and impossible problems and and whatever decision you
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:31.620]  make people are going to disagree with it and so actually the safest most
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:36.460]  defensible position that an ad blocker can take is to just block everything
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:40.900]  like that that is the most defensible position that I think that most of them
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:44.760]  can take and they just have to then own what they actually are and this this is
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.360]  the part I had a problem with like you can't just say I'm gonna block trackers
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:54.260]  and I'm gonna serve only good you have to hit some people in in the process of
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:59.260]  being effective like some people have to lose and some of them are gonna be good
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.900]  people like the deck you know we know all these people like these are good
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.980]  people but if you're saying I'm selling an ad blocker it has to block the deck
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:12.980]  and and it's weird and if you if you sell an ad blocker and you know about
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:18.060]  the deck and you know the deck is ads and you whitelist it or you you
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.420]  explicitly like go and omit it from your database once it was already there and
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:27.220]  you're selling people an ad blocker then you're lying to your customers that's
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.580]  why I don't think you should call it an ad blocker I think right but if you
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.100]  don't call it an ad blocker nobody buys it that's the problem you know it's it's
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:39.740]  a terrible business I think that I don't know I don't know if that no one would
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.060]  buy it I mean what did you how did you what did the marketing materials for
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:48.180]  peace describe it as it said peace block ads and trackers powered by ghostery
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.960]  something like that block web ads and trackers I would have said something to
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.780]  the effect of well I wouldn't use the word crappy but block crappy ads and
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:04.020]  trackers and think of you know put that it off the top of my head I can't think
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.340]  of the way I would say that but that would be the gist of what I would get
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:12.220]  across in very few words block crappy ads and trackers and then that lets you
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:17.380]  whitelist and and there are like one of the most popular ones right now and then
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.460]  one if anybody wants my recommendation right now the one I'm using is one
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:27.480]  blocker and by the by default one blocker does not block the deck I've
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.100]  actually exchanged some emails with Ben Brooks who's doing a lot of work at the
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.360]  Brooks report let really serious yeoman's work especially if he's you
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.460]  know he's like restarting his iPhone in between testing these things just to
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:42.300]  sort of get it to his neutral estate and clear on the cash because as you said
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.740]  like the system is buggy and it's really hard to know for sure whether something's
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.540]  enabled or not and sometimes the system will like I had to I had to make a test
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:56.220]  URL that like on pieces website a test URL that would load and would try to
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.980]  redirect to something that piece blocked and then would detect whether the
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:03.180]  redirect succeeded or not and notice and so like I had this button in the app it
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.200]  would just test installation and it would like slide up a web view for a
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.920]  second and test something and slide it back down and have and tell you what
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:16.340]  happened but it's very buggy it's a very buggy system what I'm looking for in
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:20.380]  an ad blocker or a content block or whatever you want call it for iOS is I
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.700]  want one that is fast and noticeably improves the browsing experience you
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:34.740]  know on my iPhone blocks as much like pernicious stuff like the type of ads
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:40.180]  that like cover up pop up and full page you know block the page I'm looking at
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:49.620]  block stuff like that doesn't block the deck by default and that's it and see
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:54.260]  the problem is that nobody agrees on where that line is I agree I agree and
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.000]  that's you know obviously that's gotta go so one of the other ways to look at
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.500]  it is no no ad blocker is going to be perfect absolutely not and and even if
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.820]  it you could say right now at this moment as I submit to the App Store I
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.980]  think it's as close to perfect as I can get it in terms of what it blocks and
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.900]  what it doesn't by next week that's gonna be different because some of the
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.580]  people you block are going to find workarounds and some of the ones you
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.460]  don't might clean up their policies it's it's totally dynamic but what I would
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.060]  what I would suggest and what I really think is possible and what I think for
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:29.820]  example one blocker right now is evidence of is that what you have to do
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.740]  is pick which side of perfection you're going to be on are you going to be as
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.080]  your blocker going to be on the side of letting through some stuff that probably
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.580]  should be blocked or is it going to be on the side of erring on the side of
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:46.360]  blocking some stuff that shouldn't be blocked and I think it's possible I
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.800]  think it's possible to build an ad blocker or a content block or whatever
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:56.620]  you want to call it that isn't over aggressive and so therefore errors on
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:59.880]  the side of maybe there will be some things that get through that that you
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.340]  wish didn't get through but that overall gives you a really fast browsing
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.660]  experience and blocks most of the stuff you want and doesn't punish people who
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:11.060]  are doing it the right way and are serving things that shouldn't be blocked
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:16.860]  I think that's possible I think one blocker is is the best proof of it today
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.340]  that it could be done but the fact is that what's amazing to me is that in
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.820]  Ben Brooks testing and he's I think he's up to like 32 of these I was content
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.980]  blockers that he's tracked in his testing one blocker isn't just fast it's
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.600]  the fastest I don't know where peace was on that because he you know he's taken
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.220]  peace out of that but the only one that's faster it was it was roughly in
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:43.380]  the middle when he still had it in the only one that's faster is some crazy
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.540]  one that I think is sort of like the one you wrote this summer that just blocks
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:51.060]  all third-party JavaScript there's one that makes that that is head and
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:55.400]  shoulders faster than anything but it breaks half the internet like he Ben
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:00.140]  Brooks he's I forget the name of it it's got like a funny name too but it there's
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:05.140]  a whole bunch of like mainstream sites that just render as a white a white box
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:10.900]  no I actually I had that issue with with my first one because I went my first
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.460]  version of peace before I negotiated the deal with ghostery it literally just
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.020]  blocked all third-party JavaScript and the funny thing is how well that works
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:24.580]  most of the time it's called it's called script scrap that's a wonderfully
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:30.140]  awkward name no I mean like it that approach actually works the vast
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.220]  majority of the time but you know the it's it's one of those things where
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.940]  like if the error rate like if the pages it breaks if it breaks on 10% of pages
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.940]  well that's actually very annoying in practice like that's that's too high of
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:47.540]  a breakage rate and the reason I went with ghostery instead was because it was
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:52.740]  the solution I found that had that had the lowest rate of sites that broke like
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.420]  things that actually just stopped working because like a lot of sites will
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:01.060]  tie in and weird ways to like especially analytics packages and especially Adobe
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:05.300]  Omniture that is one like Apple site breaks with without that a bunch of
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.620]  sites like that like functionality actually stops if you don't have certain
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:14.020]  trackers enabling ghostery actually keeps a database of that and and builds
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:19.420]  it into their to their extension to to try to like whitelist like to try to
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:25.060]  whitelist things like that that are fairly innocent on certain sites that
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.620]  are required for them to work properly like and they maintain a list of sites
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.900]  that break with you know for example Omniture disabled and that's
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.740]  automatically whitelisted by default I forget what it was that I couldn't
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.380]  there's a part of Apple's developer website that I couldn't get working I
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.180]  was like what the hell's going on yeah and it just occurred to me it was like
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.780]  oh maybe I should whitelist this and ghostry and I did and it worked I was
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.860]  like oh man of all the sites I never thought that I would have to dick around
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.180]  and ghostry it was apple.com it's literally has no ads and let you know
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.900]  unless you consider the entire website don't add you know has no ads that you
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.780]  would think of as web ads but it actually breaks without it being it was
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.380]  I think it was exactly that Adobe Omniture whatever the hell that is well
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.060]  and that's I don't even know I think it's some kind of analytics thing but
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.420]  you know one of the one of the problems one of the reasons why we have such
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:19.540]  obscenely rampant and over-the-top tracking on the web is this this culture
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:25.140]  of data people we're like everything it is considered outrageous and obscene and
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:30.860]  and reckless if you run a website today that doesn't do very detailed analytics
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:36.180]  and behavioral tracking like if you if you have access to quote data and you're
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.180]  not collecting it and you're not mining it and analyzing it for eyeballs and
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:44.420]  various other body parts like it is like that you're considered like
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.340]  negligent almost in an owner of a website not doing all this tracking like
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.540]  the standard industry wisdom and the pressure from everywhere in the industry
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.660]  is to track as much as you possibly can and and this is and we can get into it
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:03.100]  here if you want one of the issues with this that that is still mostly under the
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.980]  radar is tracking happening inside of apps that can't be blocked by Safari
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:13.340]  content blockers yeah no definitely like Twitter is famous for like always
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:18.140]  pushing the boundaries of like like they they they had this database of like
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.900]  something like over a thousand URL schemes custom iOS app URL schemes that
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:28.180]  they that they would call can open URL on the system API and that would tell
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.260]  them which of these URL schemes were registered and they could then derive
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:36.660]  which apps does each user have installed and they could tailor their ads and they
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.380]  could sell their as they could they could actually sell people the idea of
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:43.100]  we can show your Twitter ad to people who have this particular app installed
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:48.020]  it's crazy and then and that you know that was so egregious of a privacy
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.980]  violation that Apple severely restricted that in iOS 9 and like they actually
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:58.060]  kind of broke it for uses like that so in other words just to explain that yeah
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.940]  I know exactly talking about but just for anybody who if that went over your
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:09.420]  head so the way sandboxing works iOS an app that plays by the rules and uses you
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.740]  know the passes the test that they do that you're not using private api's
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:17.820]  can't really look outside at sandbox and look at the file system and see what's
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:26.100]  in your iPhones slash applications folder you can't do it but what Twitter
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.620]  did and I'm sure other people did but Twitter I guess really went far is when
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.580]  a color got caught when a custom app like if instapaper has an instapaper
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.940]  colon slash slash URL scheme and then you know the idea of the URL scheme is
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:45.500]  hey that way another app can integrate with instapaper and this is really
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:49.900]  common in pre-sharing sheet days where you know apps would the only really way
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.740]  that apps could communicate which with each other want you know instapaper
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:58.220]  communicating with tweetbot or something like that was through a URL scheme so if
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:04.380]  if tweetbot was going to integrate with instapaper it used it URL scheme did it
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:08.900]  I admit you you know is that how tweetbot used to integrate with instapaper
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.460]  as far as I remember yeah I mean almost all the all the Twitter clients
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.740]  integrated paper eventually and but through a custom URL scheme but then to
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.300]  make a nice user experience there was an API so Twitter tweetbot or whatever app
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:26.740]  you know Twitter effect whoever would call it if I send an instapaper colon
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.540]  slash slash URL is it going to be handled yes or no and then if it's the
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.060]  answer is no it's like oh well they don't even have instapaper installed I
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:38.260]  won't even give them the option so Twitter you used it to survey whether
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:42.420]  there were any of a thousand apps were installed on this system and and used it and then
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.500]  they of course know your Twitter account because you're logged into Twitter
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.660]  you're using Twitter yep and they would transmit that data back to Twitter and
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:52.180]  they would save it probably forever on your account and their ad analytics
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:55.380]  database like it all this creepy stuff that was made possible by this
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:01.060]  relatively innocent intending system API yeah and so that but this it's sort of a
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:05.100]  tangent but it absolutely gets to something that is a false accusation
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:13.460]  against me which is that in in my defense of I think the problem that some
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:17.860]  people seem to have with my take on this is that I'm not an absolutist that I
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:23.980]  don't feel like that and and I feel like there's some people who who want to say
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.300]  that if you're gonna block some ads you have to block them all and if you're
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.540]  going to whitelist some ads you have to see them all and I I just I think that's
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.340]  bullshit I think it's and I think it's provably bullshit because people are
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:41.300]  doing just what I'm suggesting which is try to you know use whitelists and
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:46.740]  defaults for your ad blocker that strike a middle ground and again who defines
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:50.580]  that middle ground and whether different people have significantly different
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.740]  taste on where that line is drawn absolutely I don't who knows how it's
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.580]  gonna shake out but I absolutely think that someone who wants to take the
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:05.100]  the absolutist all-or-nothing approach is is being stubbornly idealistic I
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:11.380]  don't know what the word is but it's and and they're fooling themselves but the
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.700]  the false accusation against me is that I'm somehow because I'm in the bag for
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.420]  Apple and Pro Apple I'm on board with Apple destroying the the open internet
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:26.100]  and taking us to a world where there's nothing but apps from the App Store and
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:31.340]  it falls for a couple of reasons number one my life's work is on a website and I
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.900]  don't have an app for it there is no daring fireball app and I still have no
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:42.700]  plans to make one my site is in Apple news I haven't done anything related to
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.780]  it I really don't even understand how Apple news works I might I might do
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:55.500]  something with their stuff I haven't really looked at it yet I I would be I
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.100]  would not be in favor of most people reading my site through Apple news I'd
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:05.500]  not in favor of that and lastly I don't think I I'm just as suspicious and
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.940]  concerned about the tracking that's going on in native apps as I am on the
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.900]  web right because native apps like the web can't the web can do a lot more
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:19.380]  egregious things they can do a lot more cross-site tracking like tracking
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.780]  between different sites by third parties the web makes a lot more of that
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.020]  possible apps you're you're mostly I mean depending on what they've
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:32.260]  integrated but you're mostly in apps limited to the maker of the app tracking
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.300]  you themselves right you know and again there are there are some exceptions
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:40.540]  like third-party packages but for the most part that's what's going on and so
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:45.140]  you do have to worry about things like like like the big the big social apps
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:49.220]  which again like when you're talking about if you want to block tracking you
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:53.820]  gotta block social and all the social widgets there that are in all the sites
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:58.220]  you have to block the fancy rich richly formatted Twitter embeds that people
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.820]  embed in blog post you would probably also have to block embedded YouTube
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.180]  players because that's owned by Google a massive ad and tracking company you know
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.300]  like there's a lot you have to block if you want to block if you want to truly
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.860]  block tracking yeah if you just take a look at YouTube is a good example
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:18.700]  because it's so ubiquitous I mean it's yeah it's central to the modern web
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:23.060]  landscape but if you ever just do a view source on a page with a YouTube embed
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:28.860]  and just start going down the rabbit hole of the iframe and and what's going
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:32.660]  on there I mean it's almost impossible to follow along but you can see that it
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:38.740]  is nothing even vaguely resembling a video tag where the source pointing to
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:46.060]  URL exactly it is you know it I'll bet like a single YouTube embed would
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.020]  probably involve more markup let alone JavaScript but just more markup than the
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:55.940]  entirety of like a typical daring fireball page exactly yeah but so but
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:01.620]  you know with with app tracking you know you're you're they can do more detailed
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:07.900]  tracking of you but in a narrower scope like you're not usually like if you just
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:12.180]  open up a random you know a random app like if you're you know there's a new
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:16.860]  game from the Crossy Road people like shooting skies or something today and I
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:20.340]  downloaded that and knowing like you know what's the most they can really do
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:23.500]  here like I know iOS is so sandboxed and everything like they're not gonna be
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.540]  able to get to all my other data they're not they're gonna be able to have like a
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:31.340]  unique identifier tied to me that they can use in you know 50 other apps that
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.900]  aren't even published by them and you know some other third-party thing to do
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.540]  it like the Crossy Road people have a new app yeah it's called shooting skies
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.540]  oh is it good I haven't launched it yet oh I mean I was gonna play it in bed
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:49.180]  tonight important planning play it in the second half of the talk show I'll
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:54.620]  play during all your adverts yeah no I always pay attention to podcast ad reads
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:25:00.700]  never skip them so is it nice do you like do you enjoy not having to do them
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.220]  because you do them on ATP yeah this was this was great like it's great to just
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:09.100]  show up to a podcast and just talk and not have to worry about like all right
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.520]  gotta get the sponsors ready gotta make sure I have all the scripts for all them
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.780]  and if I don't gotta write some and you know review them and everything has
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.100]  there ever been any discussion about letting Casey do some of them I don't
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:23.040]  think we've ever actually talked about it I think he's kind of assumed yeah he's
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:27.920]  so much nicer than me John you should do it but John does the toaster ones which
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:33.540]  is yeah is the greatest single greatest ad campaign in my opinion in podcast
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:36.940]  history is there's a it's a good one this week too this is a toaster week
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:43.820]  this week it's a good one it's a really good one it's cards against humanities
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:48.340]  campaign and for any of you I'm guessing it is enormous number of the people
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:51.820]  listening to this episode listen to ATP as well but for those of you who don't
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:57.340]  on on the accidental tech podcast there's a year-long maybe over a year
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:03.120]  long it's this whole calendar year it's it's almost over from cards against
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.920]  humanity and the entirety of the ad campaign there is absolutely no talking
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.780]  points about the game itself it's they just send John Syracuse a toaster oven
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:19.420]  every time an ad is coming up yeah once a month once a month they send him a
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:27.540]  toaster oven any tears into it on air yeah it's like the the entire role of
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.460]  the ad is for John to just review a new toaster oven every month talk about the
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:35.620]  dials talk about you know how well it works the knob feel you know what
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:40.380]  egregious design mistakes that they've made yeah turns out there's a lot of
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:46.660]  really badly designed toaster ovens out there and he takes it totally serious as
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.620]  of course he does it's fantastic but anyway it's it must be nice I don't I
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.180]  enjoy it when I'm a guest on somebody else's podcast as well yeah it is quite
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:57.040]  nice even though I do enjoy actually enjoy doing these reads though I've
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.580]  gotten I think I've gotten better at it and I enjoy it because I've gotten to
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:04.500]  a point now where I feel like it's a game where I'm trying to keep people
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:11.180]  from hitting the 30-second skip really and if you do if you know you know it is
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:15.540]  what it is and you know it it's funny it's because that's ad blocking right I
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:20.220]  mean it ties into it the 30 very similar yeah it's it's like it's not quite the
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.780]  same but it's very similar it's it's in the ballpark for sure I actually saw
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:30.560]  somebody on Twitter in at peak peace controversy I still think that's so
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.660]  funny that I think it was such a good name for a blocker and I think it's so
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:44.420]  funny that the way that it played out was so unpeaceful for you yeah but I saw
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:51.540]  somebody who who tweeted something to the effect of it's actually a pretty
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.900]  clever idea that somebody who writes a podcast client could you know for any
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:02.540]  given episode of a show if you tracked people's use of 30-second skip you could
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:09.780]  probably very easily pinpoint where the the sponsor breaks are in the episode
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:13.980]  right and and you know this is like I thought of this feature two years ago
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.620]  okay I think everybody who has made a podcast app has thought of this feature
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:22.900]  especially once Amazon launched their shared highlights for kindles like it's
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.480]  very similar to that you know it's like you you kind of
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  tracking what people highlight and then things that get highlighted a lot you
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.540]  can say are important and you can default to highlight them well you could
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.820]  in a podcast app yeah you could track what's being skipped and sections of a
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.220]  podcast that are skipped a lot you can have an option to just automatically
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:42.820]  just skip them and first of all you know it would be hard to make that work very
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:46.900]  well in a way that wouldn't annoy people and that would that would be obvious
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:51.420]  what's happening but second of all I think like I've talked to other other
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.020]  podcast app makers and mentioned this before and everyone always says the same
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.620]  thing the same thing I thought which is I don't want to do that to podcasting
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:07.300]  because I know like that would that would by nature hurt podcasting and I
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:12.380]  don't want to do that I you know and I feel like that I feel like the other
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:17.500]  thing is that it's it's so respectful you know it's just time you know and
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:23.020]  it's you know I I've gone to for some of these summer episodes just because I've
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.420]  fallen way behind a weekly schedule but my episodes are very long and so I
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.380]  absolutely I do stick to never more than one and a half hour which I feel like
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:38.700]  it's pretty fair and it compares extremely favorably to terrestrial radio
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:45.100]  oh my god yeah and not even close and even compares I think very well to like
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:52.300]  the Howard Stern show on Sirius like Amy Amy's a huge Howard Stern fan and she's
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:56.200]  still annoyed by the fact that the whole thing that pitched her on Sirius in the
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.500]  first place is that it was commercial free and and they were like except for
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:04.780]  Howard Stern because we can tell a lot of very expensive ads on his show you
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.760]  know I think in the history oh they aren't very expensive I've bought them
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.220]  before well but from their perspective in the aggregate they are I'm not saying
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:16.020]  each spot is but I think that I don't think that they could do I don't think
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:19.940]  they could I don't think they could pay his salary if it wasn't for that I don't
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:26.340]  know yeah I disagree you think you could go you think I paid less for a live read
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:31.540]  on his show than what you and I charge for live reads on our shows right now
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:39.020]  I'm serious that's amazing you got you got Howard to actually read it yeah yeah
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:42.300]  it's still a lot of live read like that was that's why it's valuable it was
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:47.900]  really great it was a really cool thing but anyway I just feel like that the
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.620]  again it's negotiation and I'm sure there are people out there listening
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.820]  right now who even though I told them not to hit the 30-second thing during
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:58.620]  the Brower thing before and they're probably gonna hit it on some of the
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:03.220]  ones that I'm about to do and that's okay I mean you know it's my job but I
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:06.460]  feel like I've gotten better enough at doing this and I feel like I'm still
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:12.020]  attracting an interesting enough group of sponsors that it's a fun game for me
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:17.020]  when I do them to try to you know you know I am when I'm doing them I'm
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:22.140]  imagining a listener with his thumb hovering over the 30-second skip and I'm
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.700]  trying to keep him from pressing it or at least only having him press it once
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:30.340]  yeah and I still think there's some value in it like for example I will I'll
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.620]  break right into one right now and here's one that I'll bet somebody I bet
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:38.820]  a fair number of people with 30-second skip because they are here almost every
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:44.820]  single week it's our friends at fracture or they'll fracture the people who print
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:51.740]  your photos on glass they sponsor the show all the time and the reason they
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:57.500]  keep coming back is because you guys out there keep buying pictures from them so
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:01.180]  you're probably familiar with them really high quality printing they print
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:03.940]  on the back of the glass you send them a photo they print it on the back of the
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:07.460]  glass it's right there on the glass not like a piece of paper stuck to it it's
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:10.420]  not a frame where there's a piece of paper behind glass it's right there on
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:15.380]  the glass really really nice the best way to get actual analog versions of
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.500]  your photos that I've ever seen because there's no work involved on your part
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.860]  you just upload the photo and then it comes back to you and it's all nice and
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:26.860]  ready to go they do have they actually have a special message that they want me
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:32.780]  to get across it's only October 1st as I record clearly a big part of fractures
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:39.180]  market is gifts people buying photos for gifts and obviously the holiday season
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:43.180]  is coming up October 1st does not sound like it's close to the holidays nobody's
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:47.580]  I don't think even though the holiday decorations seem to go up earlier and
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:51.500]  earlier in retail usually people at least wait till Halloween we're still in
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.540]  pumpkin spice season right now yeah exactly you gotta wait till pumpkin
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:33:02.020]  spice goes away but fracture wants me to remind you that they do get backed up at
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:07.220]  the holidays and so this might be a good way to just knock out a couple of your
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:11.860]  Christmas gifts really really early and not worry about cutting it close and
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.500]  getting caught behind because it by the end of December they actually can't keep
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:19.300]  up and you can't do it last minute and get it in time for Christmas because
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:23.940]  they're so so busy so think about it think about the people who you might
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:29.900]  want to give a fracture image to for the holidays and get it over with now just
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.660]  do it and you'll feel better you'll know you have you know somewhere sitting in
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:35.820]  your office you've got these boxes packed up you've already got some of
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.260]  your Christmas gifts knocked out ready to go really is a good gift we do it
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:44.220]  every year I can't even imagine until fracture isn't even around anymore I
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:47.380]  can't imagine that a holiday season is going to go by where we don't get some
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:52.820]  of these for some of the people in our family really really great stuff where
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:34:02.060]  do you go to find out more their website is fracture me calm and their URL code
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:07.620]  is I think daring fireball and if you've never ordered for them before it use
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:13.740]  that code daring fireball and you will save 15% off your listeners first order
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.900]  and if you're listening to the show if you're like a Marco fan you could use
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:21.140]  the code ATP and you'll save the same amount and you'll you'll give the the
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:30.740]  mojo to to the accidental tech podcast ATP 15 ATP 15 what did that change used
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:35.020]  to be ATP right or did they I think I think in 2015 I think it became me to be
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.780]  15 anyway you could do that long-term that you know they were sponsors before
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:42.020]  2015 they've been long-term sponsors anyway it's all good they're a great
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:47.580]  company with a truly truly great product and you know if you've ever wondered why
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.420]  in the world do they keep sponsoring these podcasts I swear it's because
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:54.700]  people keep buying the factors from them so so keep it up and really really can't
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.900]  say enough about I just bought one as a gift a couple weeks ago and I'm about to
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:01.660]  do another one they make great gifts yeah you get you do get because most of
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.500]  the people in your family probably don't listen to your podcast just like mine
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:09.100]  so they have no idea and when they see them they there really is like a whole
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:13.300]  like well how did in the world did you make this and you just say you know you
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:17.980]  could tell them just tell them you know go to fractured me calm yeah no I I have
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:23.220]  severe gift-giving anxiety every year and and to have it to have an easy
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:25.900]  solution that's kind of like a go-to thing like if I don't know what to get
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:29.860]  somebody in my family I can get them a cute picture of you know my
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:34.860]  grandparents or my kid or something you know that works out well yeah I don't
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:39.220]  know you I I'm always envious of your ad reads you and hello internet I think do
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:43.060]  the best live reads I've heard those bastards those guys they aren't they
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:48.540]  frustratingly good yeah that actually cuz it again I do I don't like I listen
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:53.180]  to yours you know because I want to see how you do it you know like it's why I
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:57.140]  listen it's just it's you know like okay it's Squarespace again what are you
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.420]  gonna do you know it's a challenge it is because I want to keep it fresh for
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:05.660]  people who aren't skipping I don't want to say the same thing every time the
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.500]  hello internet guys god they're freaking really good at it yeah like it's
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:12.940]  frustrating enough that their podcast is so good in general but that they all
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.500]  so just kill it on the ad reads and that they record like I've always wanted to
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.860]  try recording the ads separately from the show and dropping them in afterwards
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:25.580]  because I thought about I don't like doing it during the show because it it
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:29.780]  makes me pay attention to something else during the show rather than what my
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.100]  co-hosts are talking about and so like I always have in my mind oh I got to do
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:36.740]  another ad now I owe what's it gonna be loaded up on screen maybe read it a
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:40.900]  couple times first like and I'm having to do all that as Casey or John are
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.980]  talking about something that and so I'm not listening to them I'm looking at an
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.220]  ad and so I feel like that makes the show worse but I I don't know I I
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:51.460]  haven't figured out how to do it well yet maybe I'll have to try it sometime
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:54.660]  and see I've I've been given serious thought to that exact same thing and I
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.260]  might play with it because I feel like it's the sort of thing I can I can play
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.300]  with and it's not irrevocable you know yeah but I feel like you do need some
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:05.580]  kind of sound effect to start and end it and I don't have one of those ready and
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.020]  that's one of the reasons I haven't done it yet because like if you just try to
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:12.020]  drop it in you sound different and everyone notices like it is very obvious
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:16.540]  like this is recorded at a different time your voice is more or less tired
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.780]  and raspy than it was and like in the surrounding parts of the show you can
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.140]  hear maybe the room sounds a little bit different maybe it's like a little bit
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.340]  more echoey or you were using the mic a little bit further away or a different
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:28.860]  mic that you were using two weeks ago or something like you can always tell when
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.780]  it when it's when it was recorded at a different time have you ever have you
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.080]  ever noticed me I've done that a few times have you ever noticed yeah every
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.380]  time I'll bet you did I notice every time yeah and I listen I listen to
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.520]  podcasts on terrible headphones and I notice every time but that's just me I'm
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.060]  a nerd but yeah if I switch to that we're not when I have done it it's
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.820]  because something has changed either I've made a terrible mistake yeah or
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:55.900]  somebody else has made a mistake and or or it I didn't get it in time you know
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.980]  that there was some kind of communication problem and it's like crap
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.980]  I told Marco we're gonna record at nine I don't have it I'll just fill it in
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.540]  later and you know it and then when I've done that in the past I've tried to fake
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:09.420]  it as best we can to do it and if it doesn't come out perfectly so what if I
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:12.340]  were to switch I would switch to something where it's obvious and it's
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.540]  you know there's a little you know sound effect a jingle or a sound yeah
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:20.620]  something like that because I I really do think it would like one of the
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:24.580]  reasons like I I've I've always been interested in the idea of trying an ad
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.620]  free show but ATP is so big now and and it's not just me that I like you know
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:34.620]  it I'm I'm willing to gamble with large amounts of money of potential future
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.260]  income but I can't make that decision for two other people alone you know this
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:42.980]  and so I don't want to like rock the boat there but one of the reasons I was
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:46.380]  motivated to even consider rocking the boat there is because I don't like doing
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:52.080]  the ads in line because I I'm afraid of the attention it's taking away of my
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.300]  attention is taking away from the conversation and I think that makes it
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.940]  worse so I should try that I got to figure out what sounds to bookend it
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:04.900]  with and just try it and I also like I heavily edit the ad reads because see
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:10.160]  this is why this is why you frustrate me because I try to cap my ad reads to
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.500]  three minutes and ideally it's you know it's it's at least one and a half and
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:19.460]  it's at most three minutes and I and if I almost always end up running way over
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:23.360]  that I'll usually I'll usually do it on the live show I'll usually do a four
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.300]  minute ad read and then in the edit I added it down to fit three and I still
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:32.260]  feel like I'm not saying everything I wanted to say in the read meanwhile you
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:35.940]  come in here and you talk at like one mile an hour during your ad reads and
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.340]  you manage to say everything that you need to say and they're not longer than
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.500]  three minutes usually like they're not that much longer or shorter than mine
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:49.780]  so you manage to somehow say way more with way fewer words in the same amount
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:52.980]  of time and your sounds more relaxed and more natural and mine sounds kind of
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:56.660]  stressed out because I'm trying to cram it all in in three minutes it's kind of
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.340]  how we write I guess yeah maybe mine were brutal at first they were really
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:05.340]  bad ice yeah and I didn't get emails complaining about it I got emails very
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.660]  sympathetic emails because even though when I first started doing the show on
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:14.120]  my own without Dan Benjamin and it was all you know obviously that was like my
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.900]  Marco moment where I really angered the internet the people who were angry
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.900]  weren't refused to listen so they weren't listening and sending me hate
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:25.300]  mail about how bad the show was they weren't even listening and they were
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:30.500]  just you didn't even get hate listeners I got some but I think most of them just
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:34.660]  didn't they really didn't get a lot of that I think they just went right to
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:38.500]  iTunes and wrote terrible one-star reviews and they were done the people
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.460]  who listen were people who were still enjoying it and they were very
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:44.860]  sympathetic and they were but it was sort of like that sort of email I think
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:48.820]  that you get when you know you come down it was like this it was exactly like the
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.260]  email I got when I talked about the stuff that's happened with my eye and
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.980]  you get these really nice emails from people saying how sorry they are then
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:59.500]  they have all my sympathy and they're like we're really sorry about the way
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:03.460]  you're doing these ad reads it's it's terrible it was like that you know like
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:08.300]  I had an affliction yeah but you picked it up pretty quickly I mean I like yeah
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:11.220]  those first few were definitely rough but I think by like the fifth or sixth
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.900]  episode you were pretty much in a groove yeah well if there's anything I did
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:19.460]  wrong and I'm not a big fan of like I read that like the guy the the Noah
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.380]  whatever his name is just taking over the Daily Show like he did like a whole
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:26.740]  week or so of test shows shows that are never gonna air but real shows they do
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:30.220]  shows I understand why you do that and it you know hosting a TV show that's as
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:34.660]  tight as the Daily Show really does have to be rehearsed but you can't rehearse
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:38.140]  the whole episode because every day it's that day's news so you have to get good
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:41.260]  at it but if there's anything that that I should have rehearsed and thrown away
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:45.220]  I should have done sponsor reads instead of doing that I should have just record
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:49.940]  you know not for episodes I should have recorded some and enforced myself to
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:53.860]  listen to them and do it because it didn't take too long it only took a
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:57.820]  couple weeks before I got at least okay at it and I could so I could have just
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:01.940]  skipped the point where I was really really terrible at it well yeah but that
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.740]  was that was part of the learning process you know you wouldn't have
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:09.100]  learned it necessarily yeah anyway the thing that really got me was that on the
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.820]  last episode of hello internet when Brady did the the fracture one and it
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:22.140]  was that he'd sent a picture to CGP gray sent a fracture to them to him of what
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:25.580]  was it that you're making rat one of the two animals that he's been obsessed with
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:31.620]  Lee yeah no the hen the hen yeah the other one yeah the official bird of
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:37.580]  hello internet right but had sent him a picture that related to an entire huge
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:41.100]  segment of the show that had already been gone so it was it just had this
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.420]  beautiful serendipity and and really made it feel like it was a part of the
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.180]  show again like I said ads are content part of the content of what you're
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:54.820]  serving is the ads it's not something separate and the hello internet the way
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:59.260]  they do it it really does feel like part of the show those guys are so
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:05.180]  frustrating they and like they have like they mentioned their numbers on the last
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:09.500]  show they have they have way bigger listener bases than we do too oh yeah
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:13.180]  it's with good reason because their show is awesome and it's like people can
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:17.380]  enjoy that show without being huge tech nerds like our shows you pretty much
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:21.020]  have to be a huge Apple nerds there to really get much out of our shows but
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:25.700]  their show is way more accessible and it really like they they joke about a long
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.140]  time ago they had a discussion about the two dudes talking podcast format which
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:34.860]  is very common especially two dudes talking loosely about tech matters but I
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:39.340]  think what makes their show so great is that yes there are a lot of two dudes
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:44.620]  talking shows but they really perfected that format like it like to have these
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.580]  two specific people talking about whatever they talk about like they have
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.340]  amazing host chemistry between the two of them and they're both amazing
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:56.940]  characters like they're they're incredibly amusing to listen to and they
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.540]  play off each other well and it's very nicely edited so you have this
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:04.420]  combination of just like no wonder it's so popular because they're really good
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:07.700]  at it and it's a really good combination to begin with yeah they also both have
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:12.740]  good voices yeah but you really can't help and you know what are you gonna do
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.820]  but well that's one thing that I love about podcasting though this whole
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.780]  episode is gonna be frustrating for like half the listeners who want us to talk
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.420]  about whatever Apple news happened this week but one thing I love about
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:27.700]  podcasting like when I was a kid I used to I think a lot of people did this who
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:32.140]  were especially who were nerds like me I used to record fake radio shows with my
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:37.300]  friends who basically like us talking into a cassette recorder as if we were
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:41.660]  on the radio and never listening back to it or listening back once and then that
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:45.100]  would be it like I we'd make these fake really like I always wanted to be a
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:52.700]  radio DJ and the reality is a that is a terrible business business of being an
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:58.740]  actual radio DJ is horrible so that's problem number one problem number two is
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.900]  I was never going to be a DJ I don't have the right voice I don't speak well
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:07.260]  enough I certainly don't have the background or the opportunity to become
[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:12.740]  a DJ or the training like you know if there's any training like I was never
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:16.660]  going to be a DJ I just I don't have the voice for it I don't have the the skills
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:20.140]  for it I'm just not cut out for that job in the same way I'm not cut out to be
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:24.180]  like you know a football player like I'm just that's just I don't have I'm not
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.380]  the person for that I'm not I'm not made for that but with podcasting it's it's
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:32.980]  really quite a meritocracy and that like one of the beauties of this medium is
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:36.780]  that you don't need to attract the wide audience that you know TV and radio
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:41.740]  people do normally with like the locality issues and everything with
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:47.380]  this with podcasting even people who talk sloppily and have mediocre voices
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:55.460]  like me can my job is podcasting I I talk on a version of the radio for a
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.180]  living and the the idea that like I'm fulfilling this childhood dream of this
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.940]  thing I've always wanted to do that I really am not qualified to do but it
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:08.980]  just happens to work out better in this medium like that is amazing to me and
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:14.420]  and as a listener of podcasts as a massive listener of podcasts I love
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:19.060]  listening to other shows that are also made by amateurs like me that are just
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.540]  talking about interesting stuff and that's something I like I know all the
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:26.460]  like the big like public radio podcast I don't listen to almost any of them
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:31.580]  because there's so much else going on that I want to listen to I don't have
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.500]  time for them because there's so much else that's made by amateurs and people
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:39.380]  like me that I'm much more interested in that's much more narrowly focused then
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:42.180]  like here's a story I'm gonna tell you about something interesting that
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:46.460]  happened you know like I don't I don't need that I I have my all my time is
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:51.140]  filled up with people talking about more narrow interest that I like better I
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:57.940]  totally agree but it it's it still makes me jealous when I hear the
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:02.300]  professionalism of hello internet yeah it is it is frustrating when people are
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:06.420]  really good podcasters who also have really good voices and production and
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:11.140]  speak well they're such they're too such interesting characters as well and
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.940]  exactly I think they're very honest I don't think that they've made up
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.520]  personas and they're just being themselves but they're you know they
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:21.980]  both seem like very very nice very nice fellows absolutely yeah and like you
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:29.340]  know like gray is obviously the straight guy you know he's the you know he's the
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:33.700]  more logical and doesn't come up with wacky ideas thing but then he's got the
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:39.060]  crazy tick like that always comes up where he when he flies he books a
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:43.220]  standby ticket and will wait weeks and weeks and weeks with not knowing when
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:47.780]  he's gonna fly which is crazy yeah that's why that show is so great because
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:54.780]  like you have these great interesting people who and and like and the fact
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.580]  that Brady can like tease that out of him and then hit him over the head with
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.780]  it constantly they're able to push each other's buttons extremely well as well
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:05.900]  like it is it is oh it's so good yeah it's really good show so anybody who
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.540]  hasn't listened to it go listen to it but yeah they're they're well beyond
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:12.860]  like you said they're well beyond our the size of our audiences we should have
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.980]  talked about us for an hour yeah deservedly so the funny thing was that
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:18.900]  they did a thing too they've done a thing which is which is actually
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.660]  interesting I've been me thinking it's funny that you bring it up because I was
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:26.040]  gonna bring it up so anybody out there do they did a thing where they
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.940]  solicited for the listeners of their show to write to them and tell them if
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.980]  they listen to the show while doing interesting things like what is the
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:39.900]  context you know something beyond just you know I listen to the show when I
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.800]  drive to work you know and there's people who are like there's like a guy
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.180]  who's like a surgeon he does like surgery on like mice brains because he's
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.860]  studying you know the effects you know some kind of scientist and they put the
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.900]  mice through a study and then he performed surgery on their brain to see
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.060]  their effect so while he's doing this he lists one of the things he does he
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.700]  listens to podcasts and he listened to their show well that's an interesting
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:13.660]  thing and they had they had a guy who who manned the the ladder why don't you
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:17.660]  call it the steps that like Air Force One like when Air Force One lands he
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:21.220]  he's the guy who like puts the ladder up there where the president comes down
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.860]  yeah the stair car right yeah the stair car listens to their show while he does
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.040]  you know and and then they even like said like and just to make sure this guy
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.500]  doesn't get into trouble he's very very clear he does this like in the you know
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.620]  like you have to stand here and wait for four hours for the president to come
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:40.600]  down well he's not he's not listening while the president might be coming down
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:44.980]  the steps he's you know he's paying attention and doing his job but it's
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:49.000]  it's obviously it's a job with a lot of waiting involved because they you know
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.780]  the president shows up when the president shows up the president you
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:56.060]  know isn't you know running on a clock what an interesting job though and to
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:01.020]  think that that guy you know is is alleviating the tedium of the waiting
[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:05.060]  part of his job or while he's off duty or whatever by listening to their show
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.420]  so anybody I would I would be interested to know the same thing if there are
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:13.020]  interesting contexts where people listen to the talk show so you can you know
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:18.940]  just email them to me and maybe I'll read some of them in a future episode I
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:24.020]  don't know anything about my audience like you said like that the you know the
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:27.780]  idea of you got it you have to hook up the data and collect all the analytics
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.420]  for everything oh yeah I I don't want to know I do like knowing what's popular I
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:36.820]  like to try to you know I try to look at the stats and mint and just to see if an
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:45.260]  article is unusually popular and I I like to see actually it's not really
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:49.100]  true audience tracking though it's you know I like to see referral tracking and
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:53.340]  see if I'm getting an unusual amount of traffic from some other popular place or
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:58.940]  site or tweet you know but in terms of like knowing things about the audience
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:04.500]  I you know I don't I don't want to know that yeah well that's like even even
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.540]  like the checking of the mint and everything like back when I wrote the
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:16.140]  the my previous controversy well the the Apple functional high ground thing after
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:21.740]  that went crazy I realized that I like there was a day where like I I just
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:24.900]  turned off analytics for the site during that because I was just kind of like I
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:28.140]  don't I don't want to be motivated by this anymore and it's kind of like if
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:32.500]  you've ever gone on vacation and and you stop checking Twitter for a while and
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:36.100]  then you have such a massive pile up that you can't keep up and you just hit
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:39.740]  scroll to top and you realize like oh I didn't read Twitter for like three or
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:45.060]  four days and I missed nothing of importance and it's kind of eye-opening
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:49.540]  well I had a similar kind of thing with with analytics on my website where I ran
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:54.300]  first mint for a while and also I ran Google Analytics for a while and and
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:59.180]  and eventually I realized when I turned it off for a little while after the in
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:03.860]  the wake of all that drama I just was like I want some some peace and quiet I
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:10.300]  turned it off for a while and I realized I didn't miss it at all and and part of
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.580]  that is a luxury that we have that you know we don't need to really know our
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:20.100]  day-to-day page views the deck bills in advance for page views basically and so
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.100]  we are paid a flat rate by the deck based on the general amount of traffic
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.820]  that we tend to have gotten over the last you know years or whatever like my
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:33.300]  rate for the deck hasn't changed in years and because my traffic is you
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:38.260]  know about the same and so it's it isn't if I write something that gets all of a
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:41.780]  sudden a million page views out of the blue I'm not gonna see another dime for
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:45.180]  that the deck has pre-sold the the ads for that and so they aren't seeing a
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:50.460]  dime for it and you know that's just so I so we have no incentive to like
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:54.420]  temporarily juice page views or write things that are gonna get temporary
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.140]  traffic really and and so the only reason I would really need to run web
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:05.140]  analytics of any kind is what you say it's like for me to know like oh where
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:10.460]  is traffic coming from and where you know what what do I write that gets
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:14.500]  meaningful numbers compared to anything else I write and and what I realized was
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:21.100]  that that information was not beneficial to my life or my work it was all it was
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.180]  doing was like being another vanity metric to check and the reality is
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:27.340]  Twitter is that vanity metric now anyway and I should probably stop checking that
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:32.020]  as well but I still do like I will check the number of retweets that like
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.820]  whenever I write a blog post I tweet about it also so I'll check like the
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.780]  number of retweets that got and I'll I have some idea like oh well this one
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:43.100]  got you know two and this one got 40 so obviously that resonated with more
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:48.340]  people but the actual web advertiser web tracking at that level for for whatever
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:52.060]  reason I've decided that's no longer a thing that that I need to care about and
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:56.900]  so I don't run any yeah I like to know some of the user agent stuff and I can
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:02.140]  I could get this out of my server logs it's just that and that's the one thing
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:05.660]  what I've been talking about getting rid of Google Analytics I'm going to I mean
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.340]  I don't it's it's seriously just a matter of days that I just unhook it I
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:16.740]  probably should just do it tomorrow and mainly because I think that it's privacy
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.500]  invasive and I actually think that it's you know wrong of me to to be using
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:27.940]  Google Analytics and it they have a very opaque privacy policy that that was I've
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:30.900]  read it and I've done this over the I've been using Google Analytics for years
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:34.820]  and there was a whole year or two period where I stopped using it and I missed
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:40.540]  some data like what percentage of my users are using which browser and what
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.900]  percentage of them are on iOS versus you know Mac OS versus other operating
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:48.620]  systems and there's ways to get that without using analytics but Google just
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:53.180]  re hooking up Google Analytics was the easiest way to do it and then I felt bad
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.300]  because a lot of my long-term stats were entirely out of whack because I had this
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:02.700]  like 14 month period where I'd shut it off but I've read their private the
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:05.660]  privacy issue is the main thing that makes me want to shut it off above and
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:10.220]  beyond anything else is that I can't shake the suspicion that Google is using
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:14.140]  the cookies they said for Google Analytics to track the people who read
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.700]  Daring Fireball across the web and using it for advertising even though I don't
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.180]  use any Google advertising and if you read their privacy policy it's important
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:25.860]  to me at least it's like to me it's like reading a foreign language and it's the
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:32.300]  way that I'm I'm amazed and impressed by attorneys who who write the contracts
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:37.780]  that run the whole world because I think I'm a good reader I've always tested high
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.540]  in terms of reading comprehension I read most most contracts and I it might as
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:45.460]  well be written in a foreign language I don't understand anything I don't
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:50.500]  understand what is going on and Google's privacy policy for analytics is to me
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.540]  that type of privacy policy I I understand what each of the words mean
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:59.620]  and then the aggregate I have no idea what it means and I've come to the
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:03.100]  conclusion that if you don't understand what a privacy policy means you your
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:07.500]  worst assumptions are probably right right no and and you know you're right
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:14.460]  that you know by by having Google Analytics on your site you are selling
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:19.340]  your visitors data to Google without their knowledge and it's one of the
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:22.020]  things like it's kind of uncomfortable like you know like a lot of the things
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:26.700]  and in web publishing and advertising if you actually face it if you actually
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:29.700]  like think about all the ramifications of that and you face the truth of that
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.940]  and you face the reality of that it is uncomfortable and you have to you know
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:37.860]  you have to weigh this decision of like you know do I keep using this for the
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:43.780]  utility it provides or do I take a principled stand and and and accept the
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:47.340]  cost of that standard so Google Analytics gives you information like how
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.900]  many people are in what country and even like within the u.s. like what state like
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:55.620]  how many you know and and unsurprisingly you know my site is largely u.s. a lot
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.500]  of people in the UK a lot of people in Germany I think Germany has always been
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:03.100]  the third country but you're already down at a very low percentage and then
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:06.100]  everybody else is spread around the world and then within the u.s. tons of
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.920]  people on the Northeast Coast most of them in California and most of them in
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.340]  California largely centered in the northern part of California you know
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:19.540]  it's exactly who you think I don't need Google Analytics to tell me that though
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:23.020]  and I find it weird and I just wonder how the hell did they know that and I
[01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:28.340]  know there's ways to go back from IP addresses and stuff like that and but I
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:32.100]  just can't help but worry that part of it is that if you're logged into Google
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:35.140]  from Gmail and then you go over to a separate tab and you're at during
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:40.260]  fireball that they're they're saying oh we know Marco lives in New York because
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:44.100]  we know everything about Marco and we've already got a cookie on this system
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:49.300]  that's right there that does this right and it doesn't take much to uniquely
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:53.980]  identify somebody between sites on the web like you can just by analyzing some
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:57.740]  very basic stuff about the request they make even if they block almost every
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:01.860]  kind of ad you know if they come to your site a couple times and if they you know
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.580]  you can you can just kind of match even if their IP changes you can just match
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:11.860]  like somebody's approximate zip code by using IP lookup and match that with like
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:15.460]  the request headers at their browser send which includes like the browser's
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:19.540]  version like the exact version the OS exact version and stuff like that maybe
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.100]  sometimes like if it has certain plugins then the plug-in version like flat like
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:26.700]  flash or Java like it'll those are all in the in the in the headers that it
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.420]  sends on every request so if you just take a couple of those things a couple
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:35.340]  of data points you can uniquely identify people surprisingly quickly like with
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:40.020]  only two or three different data points and of that kind of set so you really is
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:44.600]  is very much like if you give them an inch to take a foot like you have to be
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:49.820]  very careful what you allow on your site if you want to actually be be protective
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.360]  of people's privacy and you have to be aware as a visitor that you know you
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.940]  might think you're that you have more privacy but in reality you are
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:01.940]  inadvertently leaking data all over the place to everybody who's willing to
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:06.080]  capture it and it's and you might not care most people don't think about it
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.500]  and they they might not care if you told them but and especially young people
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:16.620]  tend not to care but certainly if your privacy minded you have to be incredibly
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:20.620]  wary of what you let in because you know they can they can do so much with so
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:27.180]  little if you go if you're logged into Google Analytics I was here and and you
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:30.940]  go to the bottom I don't maybe they have a separate one I don't know but when you
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:35.220]  go and hit privacy policy it just takes you to Google's main privacy policy
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:43.940]  which is for you know everything that Google does so it's just I I don't even
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:48.340]  know if that's what they mean you know like what I want to know as a publisher
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:52.740]  is what are my readers being exposed to here and what's being tracked about them
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:56.340]  and it doesn't seem like there's any good way to get that answer or if there
[01:59:56.340 --> 02:00:01.580]  is I I'll be damned if I can find it and to me that's just worrisome so I don't
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:06.580]  I really got to get rid of it I'm sure there's other ways I can do it I don't
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:09.800]  know I'm there's this the system I'm thinking about installing is called
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:14.860]  PP wick pie wick P I W I K yes that's a pretty common one yeah I'm not quite
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:19.860]  sure what information is there but the gist of pie wick P wick whatever it's
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:24.100]  called is that it's like mint in that it's locally stored and so I would be
[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:28.900]  running it my own copy of it on my server storing my copy of the stats in
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:34.460]  my SQL database and it's there are no cookies that are shared across other
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:38.820]  sites or anything like that that would track you all it is is knowledge of what
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:43.940]  people coming to my site do so there'd be nothing privacy invasive about it at
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:47.900]  all other than the fact that you are a person who is reading my site which you
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:53.860]  know I obviously do know some of the stats though that from I don't know what
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:56.980]  pie wick has but some of the stuff like that is interesting and I will miss but
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:00.540]  I don't miss it enough to keep using Google Analytics is like the number of
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:04.020]  people using which browser and how many people use which operating system and
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:06.900]  stuff like that right and some of that you can get out of the user agent but a
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:09.820]  lot of it you you have to use JavaScript to get it's like things like like you
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:13.340]  know whether it has written a screen or not but I just think so much of that
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:17.180]  stuff is just becoming so irrelevant you know like like what what would you
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.940]  actually do with that information you know most of it is not that important
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:25.020]  well and the other fact is that I don't like like I truly do believe like I'll
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.340]  say it over and over again if there's a theme of this episode it's that
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:32.340]  everything you publish on your site is content and counts and so I don't want
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:35.980]  JavaScript executing that's set at getting the bounds of the screen it's a
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:40.780]  waste of CPU time you know and you know I get all Syracuse II here but I'm sure
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:44.100]  it doesn't take very long for a little bit of JavaScript just just figure out
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:50.460]  what the current screen size is and send it back but every little thing you do
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.660]  that tests like that adds up to something and all of a sudden you've got
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:02:00.500]  you know five seconds of load time for ads and trackers and analytics you know
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:07.980]  and each little step of it is you know a tenth of a second exactly so anyway got
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:15.060]  to get rid of Google Analytics I might as well take a break right here and talk
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:19.860]  about our next sponsor it is is a new sponsor first time sponsor of the show
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:26.660]  they're called just works j-u-s-t-w-o-r-k-s
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:32.340]  running payroll filing w-2s negotiating health care prices I'm already asleep
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.460]  this sounds terrible these are all the things that if you're a small business
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:43.260]  owner that you could be doing instead of listening to the talk show sounds like a
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:46.940]  lot of fun right well you could instead just let just
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:52.380]  works take care of that stuff for you just works helps businesses take care of
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:57.820]  all that type of let's face it crap benefits payroll HR not that it's crap
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:01.020]  that it doesn't matter I think most of your employees think payroll is very
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:05.940]  important but the bookkeeping aspects of it actually doing the work of making it
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.940]  run and making all the books add up and making sure everybody gets paid what
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:12.740]  they're supposed to be paid busy work right you're not in a so bad you're not
[02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:15.340]  in a business of running payroll you're in the business of whatever your
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:21.660]  business is so check them out their website is just works dot-com they help
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:26.180]  businesses take care of this stuff they do it all for you running a successful
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:30.700]  business is hard enough doing the actual business of whatever your business is
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.700]  whatever it is making apps making websites selling coffee whatever it
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:41.620]  could be but all those little details of HR and payroll and stuff like that can
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:44.780]  make it feel overwhelming it's probably the sort of thing that keeps a lot of
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.020]  people from even starting a small business in the first place because you
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:50.740]  just think well who the hell am I you know I can't afford to hire somebody did
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:56.380]  this well just works it's just easy and intuitive software very very affordable
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:00.440]  great prices it's not like you're hiring somebody to do this for you you're
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:06.820]  paying a little internet service to do it and take care of it so if you run a
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:11.620]  business and you have payroll you have benefits compliance with HR stuff like
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:17.460]  that go check them out at just works dot-com take it all off your shoulders
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:22.740]  relax listen to more podcasts and you can use this code very easy there's a
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:27.660]  nice code TTS the talk show three-letter code when you sign up and you'll save
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:33.580]  10% off your first year of service it just works calm so if you run a business
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:39.620]  go check them out you're you're just wasting your time if you don't probably
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:42.020]  a good sponsor for the show I bet there's a lot of people who run
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:45.820]  companies that have to do stuff like that yeah I had to do that for a little
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:50.740]  while and I use one of the other big services to do it and they forgot to
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:54.860]  file these state workers comp stuff and I had to I was threatened by New York
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:05:00.340]  State to have to pay $15,000 a day until it was resolved and I was able to
[02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:04.820]  negotiate that down and only pay a few thousand bucks but man yeah well you
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.440]  want a company that does that right and I can tell you the big guys don't always
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:14.060]  so I would definitely give just works a shot yeah really good I would
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:18.500]  definitely do it I'd say anything I it's always worth reevaluating your life
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:21.860]  anytime anything that is a pain in your ass you should look and see if there's a
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:26.980]  way that you can pay someone to do it for you yeah that's a really good rule
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:35.220]  in general and it's it is it it's the best part of the internet era of modern
[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:44.340]  society is that an entirely new realm of things can be automated that just wasn't
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:50.060]  feasible before right like you know you know it's a silly example but like those
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.940]  the buttons that Amazon gives you out now so like when you're running out of
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:58.520]  detergent you can just hit a button and have detergent sent to your house so
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.660]  bizarre but there's no way that could happen before the internet right there's
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:06.220]  no way before the internet that that that you could just easily set up a
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:09.900]  thing that would do the payroll and HR for your company like it just wasn't
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:13.540]  feasible how how would you interact with them you need the internet and a website
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:17.740]  you need some way of interacting with them you know like the Sears catalog
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:22.380]  existed so you could order stuff to get shipped to your house before the
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:27.500]  internet but you can't have like a print based interaction with the company
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:32.780]  that's handling your HR you know I think you'd have to use a fax machine maybe an
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:38.060]  LP player you know I think right now I might be this might be a good thing to
[02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:43.620]  keep track of is how long I've gone without being asked to either send or
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:48.340]  receive a fax and I think I think if I had been doing that you know like this
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:53.220]  many days since an accident at the plant I think I think that right now knock on
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:59.940]  wood I might be in the longest stretch of not having been asked to do a fax in
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:05.380]  my life I wait till you buy a house are you serious oh yeah that's gonna break
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:08.380]  your stretch day if you're if you're gonna buy a house anytime soon I'm
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:13.780]  pretty sure they still I mean these days you can usually somebody who asked you
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:18.140]  to fax something you can usually say can I scan it an email to you instead and
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:24.340]  usually they will say yes but but not always and you know the percentage of
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:28.940]  time you can do that is going up thank God but I don't have a working scanner
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:33.280]  in the house or I I do I shouldn't say I don't have a working scanner I've got a
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:40.540]  doxy but I don't you gotta go snap you gotta go scan snap I don't I don't have
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:45.300]  I don't know where it is and Amy I've mentioned this before Amy recently gave
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:50.940]  me a wonderful gift she cleaned up my office and my office is a mess I mean
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:54.540]  it's like a serious Andy Rooney situation but I do have it's not a
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:58.300]  system I'm not and I'm not even saying it's a good idea but I generally you
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:01.100]  know if I go a long time without cleaning up my office I have a vague
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:07.940]  idea of in which pile on which shelf something is she cleaned it all up and
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:11.160]  and you know it's all organized and stuff but I don't know where that is so
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.140]  usually when I have to scan something I don't I don't know where an actual
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:20.700]  scanner is and so I just take a picture with my phone like I'll ask them I'll
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:24.780]  say can I scan it and email it to you and they'll say yes and I'll just take a
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:30.540]  picture with my phone and then crop out the table just send them that and I've
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:34.540]  never once heard anything you know well and there are also there are lots of
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.500]  apps that will do a fancier job of that like they'll use they'll still use the
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.940]  phone camera but they'll be able to like detect where the page is and then like
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:45.300]  de-skew it so it's properly you know lined up and everything I know smile
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:50.140]  makes one I think it's PDF scan plus yeah yeah yeah they make one there's a
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.020]  bunch of these on the App Store but I have theirs I'm pretty sure I I honestly
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:58.540]  never use it because I have I have a scan snap which is awesome but but a lot
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:01.540]  of people use those apps on the phone and they're fine and you know for your
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:05.260]  scanning volume it's which sounds like it's very low that's probably fine this
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:10.980]  is extremely low very very low on the scanning volume anything else you want
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:18.980]  to say about peace no I'm glad it's over I mean it really does seem like it's
[02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:24.300]  over now like it I I really you know I'm still getting like the the various like
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:32.780]  inquiries from media people I got a good one earlier let me this is a guy on
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:37.300]  Twitter asked me earlier any chance you can join us for a webinar on ad
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:44.980]  blockers for the ad industry this coming Tuesday I can DM you more details I can't
[02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:51.820]  imagine a tweet that was less well-crafted to get my response than
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:58.900]  that yeah I I so I'm still getting a lot of these like media requests from
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:03.620]  people who want me to go speak at their webinars to the ad industry about ads
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:09.300]  but for the most part everything else has died down and it is I'm just so
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:13.740]  relieved and so now I'm back to working on overcast which is so much better like
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:17.220]  as I said like it's probably not gonna make anywhere near the right amount of
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.300]  money that piece did but I don't care because it I would I'm so much happier
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:26.780]  working on it it's no contest I I thought that you really it seemed on
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:30.380]  your show and this wasn't even talking to you but it just seemed listening to
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:35.820]  ATP that it really hit you hard personally like you the thing that
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:41.380]  seemed to me to most upset you was the idea that that this thing that you built
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:45.420]  in two weeks and I think you're probably right I mean maybe on and off you've
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:50.180]  been thinking about it all summer but a really really low level of effort
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:59.620]  relative to everything else was going to significantly out gross the app that
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:06.020]  you've been working on for years and thinking about for even longer and that
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.540]  you want to keep working on for years to come and that that seemed to really get
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:16.780]  to you yeah I mean and you know it is really it is impossible to to understate
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:22.060]  how little code there is in peace like people who asked me like a bunch of
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.260]  people in a bunch of their the angry responses were along the lines of the
[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:29.860]  only responsible thing for you to do is to open source it since you abandoned it
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:34.100]  and first of all I can't because it has ghost trees data which I don't have the
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:39.980]  rights to but but the actual application code that is not just the database of
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:46.060]  sites is so tiny it there's almost no code there because Apple basically made
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:50.940]  this entire content blocking framework to be really efficiently designed to
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:55.780]  create ad blockers and so that's why I assume from the beginning I assumed I
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:59.100]  assumed that mine wouldn't get significant traction because I assumed
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:04.580]  there would be tons of them on right on day one and and there were a handful but
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:08.840]  not nearly as many as I expected but yeah that but I did you know like the
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:14.900]  reality was that the the iOS ad blocker business is not a technical challenge at
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:20.060]  all it is I mean I suppose if you've never made an app before it's as
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:23.980]  challenging as making any other kind of app but if you are if you are an
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:28.060]  experienced app developer you can crap out a content blocker in a week or less
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:34.500]  you can do it in a couple days I mean it it is so easy to do and it is therefore
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:39.340]  not intellectually stimulating it's not satisfying really beyond you know the
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:43.180]  first couple days then it's just grunt work and it's just keeping up the
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:47.420]  database which is really boring and which is not programming and it's not
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:53.580]  intellectually valuable so it is it is not stimulating if you desire that kind
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:13:01.700]  of intellectual satisfaction so whereas overcast is full of really satisfying
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:06.900]  complex technical problems that require my brain to be really working at its
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:13.660]  best to solve properly and that is incredibly satisfying to me and I and I
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:17.460]  would I would much rather work on that do you have the number do you know how
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:25.100]  many ATP listeners listen to via overcast it's something like 60% it's
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:29.820]  it's in it's in that ballpark yeah I think it's very close to that for me
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:37.500]  because I do get those numbers from SoundCloud where I host the audio you
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:42.180]  see how I always forget how to hell to click around and get it though oh yeah
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:50.500]  overcast number one yeah even more and second place is Apple core media iPhone
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:56.780]  which I 99% sure translates to the built-in podcast app yeah it's also it
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:00.180]  also includes like anything with AV player so like if you if you if you're
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:05.620]  playing a web page embed or certain podcast apps actually report themselves
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.500]  as that just because they don't change it or they can't reach that that part of
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:13.740]  the API with the level they're playing at so there some will be included in
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:18.780]  there yeah for me it's a little it's a right around 50% so it's not quite 60%
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:25.160]  but no no surprise that that it's more like 60 for you since you wrote the
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:33.460]  thing but it's actually I'm about 50 yeah that's right 49.92 on three
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:35.720]  episodes ago because I figured that like you know that gives people enough time
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:42.800]  to actually download it so yeah I'm up there actually let me change it to a
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:48.300]  month and see if that changes anything yeah actually it's even more actually
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:54.080]  if I look bigger it's actually more yeah it's because I haven't had an episode in
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:58.220]  the last seven days so if you count the whole month which gets to all the people
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:03.180]  who listen right away and you know I think I think it under samples the
[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:05.960]  people of the last seven days because the biggest fans of the show listen when
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:09.380]  they're new and so in the last seven days there haven't been any so really
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:13.860]  really overwhelmingly number one for for my listeners and if anybody out there
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:16.420]  has been curious about I really do recommend it not just because Marco's on
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:20.300]  the show today but it's my favorite app for listening to podcasts I'm really
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:23.580]  good at promotion so here I am talking about the app that I just pulled off the
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:30.980]  store for two hours while I'm gonna ship overcast 2.0 like pretty soon and I'm
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:34.740]  not gonna be right back on to talk about that in like three weeks or whatever no
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.260]  I'm really not good at this promotion yeah you're not good at it at all the
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:46.340]  big new feature in overcast 2.0 is the streaming engine yeah which is in
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:50.260]  addition to just letting you listen to stuff right away instead of download the
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:55.860]  whole episode it's really more of like it just play just it's like a just play
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:58.740]  interface so whether you care about stream if you think you care about
[02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:02.380]  streaming podcasts or not if you've ever been frustrated because you want to just
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:05.380]  start playing something but your phone's been asleep or whatever and it didn't
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:08.380]  download in the background or it just you just got the alert that the new
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:11.580]  episode of hello internet is out and you want to listen to it right away it just
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:15.420]  means that you hit the play button and it'll just start playing that's it I
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:19.860]  mean so many people like when I when I was talking you know a year ago about
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:23.220]  how streaming was gonna be a big deal and I didn't even include it in 1.0
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:26.640]  because I knew that not everybody would need it I heard from so many people who
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:31.580]  said please don't work on that please do other things because I don't care about
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:36.020]  streaming and granted I heard from way more people who said I won't use this
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:41.860]  until it has streaming which was you know the more common emotion by far but
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:45.820]  a lot of people just keep saying I don't need it I will never use it but the
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:50.700]  reality is it is really nice to have for those times when you know what you said
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:54.140]  an episode just came out or just came in you just got you just synced it and you
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:58.940]  want to start listening to it right now and podcasts can be you know 50 100 megs
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:02.580]  and not every CDN is fast and not every connection that you might have as fast
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:06.820]  and so a lot of times you know if you if you have to wait for the whole podcast
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:11.460]  to download you know it might take 10 20 seconds or it might take five or ten
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.820]  minutes no matter what it takes it feels like an eternity as you're sitting there
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:18.660]  watching this stupid down thing one percent two percent and you're like oh
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:22.500]  my god I just want to listen to it now and so like streaming really makes
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:26.620]  everything a little bit better and it enables a bunch of other little stuff
[02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:31.980]  like it enables me to although I haven't done this yet to put the put a play
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:35.180]  button on the notifications for new episodes so you can just start playing
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:38.820]  them immediately like stuff like that just like there's so many new little
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:42.140]  things that it makes possible and so many old things that it makes better
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:45.300]  because right now with streaming now you can just as long as you are connected
[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:50.260]  somehow you can tap on any episode in any list whether you have it or not and
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:54.500]  it started it just starts playing yeah and it's one of those things where again
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:59.580]  the absolutest position it just doesn't work in software design or if you want
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:03.700]  to say nope no settings whatsoever the app I'm gonna make all the choices for
[02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.580]  the user and do them right way or you could say everything should be
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:10.220]  configurable and and the users be able to configure everything well both of
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:14.500]  those extremes are absurd and if you think you're sticking to them you're
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.860]  fooling yourself the right way to think about it is you do have kind of have to
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:20.860]  pick which side of the 50-yard line you're gonna be on though are you gonna
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:26.460]  make this sort of app where you're going to default to not offering options and
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:32.180]  configurability and maybe you know you'll wind up not having enough options
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:38.020]  or are you gonna default to saying yes to most things and having options for
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:42.860]  things and you know you're gonna wind up with a complex number of settings and
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:46.660]  and you know one way or the other you're gonna you're gonna disappoint some users
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:54.860]  I clearly you Marco Arment err on the side of not offering too many options in
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:59.460]  the stuff that you build I mean and peace was a canonical example of that
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:03.540]  but you have to you've talked about this on ATP there have to be some settings
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:08.580]  for streaming because it's different people have it like around the world
[02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:12.180]  even maybe even within the country even just in the United States have
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:19.540]  incredibly different situations with and tolerance levels for data charges right
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:23.140]  there's people who are living in countries where you you know they're
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:27.380]  they're online database you know their online data is still measured in
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:33.500]  megabytes not gigabytes or people who are traveling internationally and are
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:37.780]  on an international data plan and you're measured in megabytes not gigabytes what
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:43.060]  you know if you're on a 25 megabyte data plan you cannot download an episode of
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:48.300]  the talk show over cellular unless you want to pay over its charges but then
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:52.540]  there's plenty of other people who have unlimited data or virtually unlimited
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:57.260]  data you know with you know 15 or 20 gigabytes a month and 150 megabyte
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.660]  podcast is no big deal and they want to download it there so there have to be
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.700]  settings I mean the funny thing is like going back to our earlier conversation I
[02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:08.220]  really sweat a lot of the details around this stuff to try to minimize data
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:14.540]  transfer meanwhile you view a couple of web pages on a big site and that's as
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:20.460]  much as a podcast episode it is it's some of the fact that people are
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:24.260]  measuring these things now I've always known that things are big and that some
[02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.340]  sites are obviously serving too much you know data or a ridiculous amount
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:31.940]  compared to the what you know something if it's an article I just want to read
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:36.100]  it should not be measured in megabytes but now that people are actually
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:39.820]  measuring it while they test these content blockers it is like holy crap no
[02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:45.060]  wonder when I was in Ireland for all that I've mowed through my hundred
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:53.140]  megabyte data plan while I thought I was being you know conservative with how
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:57.580]  much I used my phone I thought that you know hey I'm just I'll just read a
[02:20:57.580 --> 02:21:00.460]  couple of articles on tech meme and see if there's anything new going on well no
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:03.540]  wonder I ate through a hundred megabytes it's like one page on the verge load
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:07.020]  seven megabytes right yeah like you see all these all these net reports now like
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:11.900]  pages seven megs nine megs 30 megs on the Boston that college that is like
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:16.740]  some create and it's like a podcast episode is like 30 to 50 megs usually
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:22.900]  these are not like like that's that's eight ten web pages maybe like it's not
[02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:26.840]  that's really scared it's really scary and really sad but anyway yeah so with
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:30.220]  streaming I yeah I've done a lot I've actually offered I'm offering very few
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:34.180]  options on n2.0 and we'll see how that plays out you know you're right like
[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:37.580]  you know you can't you know the absolute positions never work there's always
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:42.560]  gonna be realities and also market pressures that set in that you know so
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.380]  I'm trying to have as few settings as possible to still make it good but of
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:50.060]  course everyone's trying that and everyone again draws that line in
[02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:53.060]  different places yeah I think the biggest thing is to try to avoid
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:58.500]  surprise right yeah like my theory like right now with the way it works right
[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:02.780]  now it's probably the way it's gonna ship is if you choose to stream
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:08.100]  something it will always allow it to use cellular in that case and the rationale
[02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:12.620]  there is that well that's how everything else works you know if you load a web
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:17.260]  page it doesn't ask it doesn't say waiting for Wi-Fi you know it just if
[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:21.060]  you click on a link to load a web page it just loads it by whatever connection
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:25.060]  it has available and if you want to restrict apps to not use soil you can do
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:29.020]  that globally in settings you can say per app you can go to overcast in the
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.940]  system settings app and you can say just never allow this app to use any cellular
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:35.600]  data like that's a switch right there you can do it a lot of people do and so
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:40.040]  all I have to do is I don't have to cover the case of people who want the
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:44.220]  app to use no cell data because the system covers that I have to cover the
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:51.660]  case of people who want to use it sometimes and or or want to use it always and so
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:56.900]  the way everything else works web pages more importantly stuff like YouTube like
[02:22:56.900 --> 02:23:01.020]  if you like you know YouTube is obviously massive that is the entire
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:04.980]  internet to people like your son and lots of other people in the world like
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:10.740]  that's that's a big deal you know YouTube if you are on cellular data and
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:15.420]  you launch a YouTube thing and go view a YouTube video it just plays it it
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:19.500]  streams it and it plays it over cell data and it's fine if you go play a song
[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:23.220]  these days you're probably playing it off cell data you know most of that's
[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:27.940]  how much people are listening to songs like so the idea of like having to like
[02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:32.000]  prompt the user or make a lot of granular settings for when to use cell
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:37.300]  data I think is outdated and and so now I think I can get away with the current
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:41.620]  options that I have which is literally it just it always allow cell data on
[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:45.780]  streaming because you initiated that like you the user said play this now and
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:50.380]  so in my opinion then you don't have to ask are you sure you want to play it
[02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:53.140]  over cell data because you're currently on the Sun that work no these days you
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:57.880]  know what year is this you play it now and then the only option I have is
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:03.980]  whether automatic background downloads should use cellular and it's default to
[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:07.340]  off the so that so the automatic background downloads will default to Wi-Fi
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:11.900]  only because in that case it's like well you didn't initiate this this came in
[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:14.180]  outside of your control you know it could have come in the middle of the
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:17.980]  night you when you were asleep and your iPad downloaded an entire episode of
[02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:21.220]  Mad Men and burn through your whole Verizon cap you know that could have
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:26.780]  happened so you know that that is a preference to me that is like okay do do
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:32.060]  you have so much data that you always want this the the app to use as much of
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:37.100]  it as it needs to or do you want to basically use it on demand yeah that
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:40.820]  seems about right that seems right let the automatic stuff stay on Wi-Fi and
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:45.420]  let the user initiated stuff play yeah and however you know you're never gonna
[02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:51.780]  win somebody's gonna complain but I think in general it's actually your
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:55.380]  logic is completely correct that if the user hits play and they have a working
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:59.380]  network connection they mean play right because that because that's how you know
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:03.060]  podcast apps historically have not worked that way always like they've
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:06.100]  offered more granular control but I'm not see I'm not looking at what other
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:09.460]  podcast apps are doing to solve this problem I'm looking at what other apps
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:14.140]  are doing not pocket like just what what people expect based on the reality of
[02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:18.380]  other apps that exist in the universe today and what that is these days is a
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:21.700]  lot of streaming media and it and it just uses cellular when it needs to and
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:25.300]  it doesn't ask you yeah I think part of it too is that things have changed so
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:29.420]  quickly in so few years and that streaming in general has just become
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:35.500]  it's a huge phenomenon but podcasting started back I mean the name even says
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:40.060]  you know it's the iPad you know that's the pod broadcasting from a time when
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:45.740]  you downloaded stuff first and then the same thing over I bought an USB and that
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.620]  it was a big deal and they podcast episodes were things you had to wait for
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:55.020]  while they downloaded because they were big whereas you know it's they're not
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:58.260]  that big anymore and you know most people a lot an awful lot of people have
[02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:01.900]  cellular network connections that handle it easily because they can handle video
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.700]  if they can handle video you can handle audio easily exactly you know so and
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:08.780]  there was there's also like there's other implementation details that that
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:14.540]  were tricky problems like one of them is if you're on cellular how much should
[02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:18.940]  the streamer read ahead of the file like should it should it just keep downloading
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:23.220]  till it has the whole thing or should it only buffer ahead like five minutes
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:28.980]  worth at a time you know and and so on and the decision I came to on that is it
[02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:32.420]  should just download as much as it can whenever it feels like it you know so so
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:36.420]  if you if you start an episode of playing over cellular you know in
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:40.980]  streaming it will download as much as it can until the connection drops or until
[02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:45.460]  it finishes the file that's it because any other solution that I thought of and
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:49.660]  tried would fail in other ways like it would it would be inconvenient or
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:54.420]  annoying or it wouldn't be what I wanted in other situations and the fact is an
[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:57.900]  entire podcast episode you know most people who listen to podcasts aren't
[02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:01.700]  listening to shows like this that are two hours long most people are listening
[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:07.020]  to stuff like you know public radio shows that are maybe 20 30 minutes and
[02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:12.140]  so those are like 15 megs 20 megs like they they were really small files and
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:16.620]  again that's like to verge articles so it's no big deal to buffer ahead
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:21.180]  whereas it is a big deal if somebody is driving on a long highway trip and
[02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:24.660]  they're counting on streaming to play their their podcast for them and they
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:27.420]  lose reception for a few minutes because they're in the middle of the mountains
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:31.300]  and the show that they were downloading just drops because it didn't buffer
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.220]  ahead enough and it could have it had the connection back there could have it
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:36.740]  could have downloaded the whole show had plenty of time to download it and then
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:40.500]  just didn't you know so there's situations like that or you know more
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:43.660]  commonly like if you're on a metro system that's underground and stuff like
[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:48.660]  that so it's it was just better again another decision that if I was making
[02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:51.540]  that decision five years ago ten years ago I would have probably made it
[02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:56.620]  differently but you know now this is this is the era where things stream and
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:01.460]  it's not a big deal and if you need to really restrict the amount of data that
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:07.820]  you use you have to consciously download media for offline use and then like you
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:11.620]  know and avoid actively streaming things or go into the system settings app and
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:15.940]  turn off cellular for all these apps I think you're on the right track think
[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:19.580]  it's gonna be a big hit let me take one last break here and hit the money button
[02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:23.940]  once again and thank our fourth and final sponsored longtime friends of the

[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:36.140]  the talk show or slash what's what do you know what your code is offhand I
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:41.700]  believe that was just ATP ATP you probably figure it out igloo is the
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:48.740]  intranet intranet that you'll actually like I love that slogan that lets you
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:53.180]  share news organize your files coordinate calendars manage projects set
[02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:57.220]  up a little microblog think of that as like a little internal like a private
[02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:00.740]  Twitter imagine if you had like a little Twitter for your team that you could use
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:06.580]  just for internal stuff that can't go public can't be shared publicly igloo
[02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:10.580]  has that sort of feature built right in their latest upgrade they call it Viking
[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:15.540]  I guess it's like a code name the big push they had this summer for Viking was
[02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:19.620]  all around documents and how you and your team interact with them gather
[02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:24.580]  feedback make changes in a lot of businesses good old-fashioned documents
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:28.100]  real files that you have to share with each other not just things that live
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:32.700]  online as URLs but real files still big part of the business big part of the
[02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:36.660]  real world so they've really really upped their game on that sort of stuff
[02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:41.740]  and they've added the equivalent of read receipts and email so you know when
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:44.180]  somebody's seen it now it doesn't go on by default you turn it's just like a
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:47.420]  read receipt an email don't ask for it unless you need it but you turn it on
[02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:50.500]  and if it's an important thing some kind of thing that you have to get sign-offs
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:55.420]  on put that on share it then you can see that everybody who needs to see it has
[02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:59.540]  seen it really really important for certain legal agreements and in certain
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:02.860]  cases if you don't need it you don't have to worry about it but if you do
[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:08.820]  need it igloo is can be part of your game now when it couldn't before big big
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:14.740]  part of their push if your company has a legacy intranet that looks like it was
[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:20.540]  built in the 90s that's because it probably was it's very very true you
[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:24.500]  should give igloo a try here's the thing that's the most amazing about igloo I
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:29.260]  keep waiting for this to end and it hasn't ended is if for up to 10 users
[02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:33.660]  you can use igloo for free you just use it so if you're on a really small team
[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:36.940]  or if you have a really small company that's under 10 employees igloo is just
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:42.740]  free it's free not for a month it's just free if you have more than 10 people you
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:47.700]  can try it out right now for free at igloo software comm slash the talk show
[02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:51.380]  try it out for free with up to 10 of your colleagues just to see that it
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:56.020]  works get it set up configure it the way you want it to work test it out and
[02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:59.220]  until you're satisfied with it you don't have to pay for anything and then when
[02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:04.140]  you are satisfied you go and they have very very low prices for per user over
[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:09.980]  10 but that's the way they work free for up to 10 over 10 you pay a very very
[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:16.460]  reasonable very competitive number of dollars per user so go check them out
[02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:19.900]  longtime friends of the show people keep writing to me I get a lot of email from
[02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:26.220]  people saying they signed up for igloo very very happy with it good software
[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:29.500]  those guys know how to spend their ad money you know they started when they
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:33.860]  started years ago they they got sandwich to make videos for him yeah they were
[02:31:33.860 --> 02:31:36.420]  they were really they've been progressive right from the start yeah
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:43.100]  they did like a TV commercials with the sandwich good stuff I don't have much
[02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:45.620]  time we've been going on forever we always go long I don't we haven't gone
[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:49.420]  on too terribly long but we don't have a lot of time left I guess we can just
[02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:57.180]  briefly it's been like two and a half briefly talk about the the new iPhone
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:32:01.660]  because now you've got one yeah we got two in the house now yeah we both got
[02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:08.060]  them so what did you guys get success she got gold I got black you know usual
[02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:18.780]  and no no pluses no and we went 16 gigs for you I think you guys have been more
[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:23.820]  more critical of the 16 gig than then I have your your you are more convinced
[02:32:23.820 --> 02:32:28.500]  that it's an upsell product mark or was it would you call it marketing I don't
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:32.940]  know that that it's it's it's not that they want to make higher margins on the
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:36.780]  16 gigabyte phones it's that they want to make higher margins because there's
[02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:42.100]  enough people out there who would if they if the bottom line was 32 instead
[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:47.740]  of 16 they would buy that 32 but they know that 16 isn't enough so they just
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:52.300]  bite the bullet and buy 64 and that's an entire hundred dollar extra hundred
[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:58.500]  dollars in revenue and probably close to $100 in you know in margin correct I
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:02.740]  mean you know you can look at something as you know well there's there's lots of
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:06.580]  justifications for this you can look at it you know there's there's reasons like
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:08.980]  you know like what like when Phil Schiller was on here and he explained
[02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:12.980]  you know a lot of justifications for why this works there's also you know I heard
[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:14.980]  from a lot of people when I were talking about this I heard from people who were
[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:18.740]  saying well you know this is for we buy these for business we buy you know
[02:33:18.740 --> 02:33:22.500]  thousands of these for our employees or whatever and we don't need them to have
[02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:25.980]  more space which I think is a terrible argument and you couldn't you know you
[02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:29.040]  can apply that same thing well like do they need cameras do they need like a
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:34.220]  headphone jack like you know that's a lots of things so there's a lot of bad
[02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:40.640]  justifications for it but I think separating justifications from reasons
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:46.220]  is important and I think the main reason for it is you're right it is not it is
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:50.100]  not necessarily to make the extra couple of dollars of margin on the 16 gig model
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:55.540]  it's that they are selling so many more of the 64s that it is most likely having
[02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:59.940]  a significant boost on the average selling price and when you're talking
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:05.700]  about the most profitable product of the most profitable company like a
[02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:10.140]  significant boost to the average selling price of their best-selling product is
[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:15.540]  massively important like that is a big deal to them and they don't always do
[02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:18.820]  what's a hundred percent best for the customer it's always a balancing act you
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:25.780]  know it's it's you know they they will they're happy to charge $45 for you know
[02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:29.100]  a leather case that they could sell for a lot less you know stuff like that like
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:33.020]  you know they they're not totally a charity here like they're doing stuff as
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:37.140]  a balance between satisfaction and profit and I think this is one of those
[02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:40.500]  things where in my opinion they've chosen wrong I think they have not
[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:45.060]  balanced this correctly in this case that I think that the long-term costs
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:54.060]  to satisfaction and to the the load of places on support on the genius bar the
[02:34:54.060 --> 02:34:58.860]  the problems people face with their full phones and trying to manage storage
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:04.220]  themselves you know I think all these things are our poor balance of of
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:09.540]  utility versus versus profit and I would say the same thing about you know other
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:15.340]  things like the the iCloud storage tier pricing you know it just got better but
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:19.660]  it's still not great like I you know there's there's problems there's you
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:22.900]  can point to all sorts of things like this with Apple and most of the stuff
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:26.460]  they do is a pretty good value but but there's there's these little edges like
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:31.180]  this where you can just kind of tell oh yeah this is they just did this because
[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:37.580]  this would be a massive difference in profit yeah and I it's weird I can't
[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:41.500]  help it I think it has to change next year although who knows you know I mean
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:44.980]  like I keep thinking well next year when I go to the seven I'll have to up the
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:50.380]  minimum to 32 and the OS isn't gonna get bigger so it'll just mean that there's a
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:55.620]  lot more free space for everybody and then I think to myself I don't know if
[02:35:55.620 --> 02:36:00.580]  I'd want to bet on that because maybe you know they've had the thing that I
[02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:03.820]  keep thinking about is if they did it again going from the six to the success
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:07.900]  with the exact same split and they changed so much other stuff they changed
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:11.940]  the actual aluminum alloy they make the things out of so it's not like they're
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:16.060]  afraid to change stuff in an S it also seems like they changed the flash
[02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:21.340]  everyone's saying it's much faster yeah and and whether that's because it's the
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:27.920]  component or it's at least the like was it ours technica I think that had the
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:35.180]  specs and wrote some code it's that the the storage controller is new and is now
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:40.400]  more like you know it's effectively like a MacBook storage controller so it's
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:45.740]  it's a serious upgrade it is in addition to like the CPU and GPU benchmarks being
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:51.940]  equivalent to the the MacBook one it really seems like they've upped their
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:57.060]  storage performance and the way they treat storage to to laptop you know
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:02.140]  MacBook quality engineering which is again it's a crazy big change this whole
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:07.660]  notion that the s ones are just minor revisions it's really really crazy I
[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:12.900]  think if anything in my review I think I undersold this this new theory I have
[02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:17.540]  which is that it takes Johnny Ives team two years I think I've got this boiled
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.920]  down to a good nut that it takes them two years to come up with it what they
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:26.900]  think is a superior design as in this is what it looks like this is the basic
[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:31.380]  gist of the you know it's gonna have this these size screens with this pixel
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:35.620]  resolution and there's going to be a button down here that you that that'll
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:41.160]  be a fingernail you know a fingerprint sensor these are the buttons these are
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:45.740]  the sizes and then it you know somebody you know the engineering teams have to
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:49.100]  decide well how do we make this and because it takes two years for these new
[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:53.500]  designs to come out and because two years is a good pace for them for new
[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:57.660]  designs any for product marketing reasons anyway it means that the
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:01.700]  engineering teams get two cracks at it they get the first crack which is how
[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:08.460]  can we make this you know to hit this ship date and you know and then they get
[02:38:08.460 --> 02:38:13.380]  a second an entire year after that too okay how can we do it how can we make
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:17.420]  that design even better and in terms of you know they rethink everything every
[02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:21.220]  single thing you touch on this iPhone is a different material then then last
[02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:25.900]  year's I mean maybe the rubber gaskets that cover the antennas are the are the
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:30.060]  same material but it's a new aluminum and it's an a new glass so if they
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:33.580]  wanted to change the minimum to 32 they could have done it and I just keep
[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:39.180]  thinking about the fact that if if the customer satisfaction downsides to the
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:44.940]  16 gig minimum whereas significant enough to worry them they would have
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:50.500]  changed it that they could have seen those numbers last year early on and
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:54.060]  known that we've got you know that's that's a thing that I think that they
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:39:00.060]  could have changed say between last December and this September and I think
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:02.940]  a lot of it is locked down a year in advance but they could have changed the
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:08.320]  minimum I do worry a little bit you know we've seen I think I think in the Tim
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.860]  Cook era of Apple I think it's safe to say based on our observations from the
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:16.860]  outside and some other statements I think it's probably safe to assume that
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:20.540]  they are more data-driven than they used to be like with Steve it was like you
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:24.780]  know it was very much still based on Steve's intuitions yeah to a lot of
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:29.020]  degree right and and you know Tim is very much is much more data driven and
[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:32.340]  so that's showing in the rest of the company and I worry one of the things
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:37.660]  that came up from various Apple people that I spoke with or that I heard from
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:43.740]  one of the things that came up during the functional high ground thing is that
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:48.060]  about half of Apple was like oh my god thank you for finally saying this I've
[02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:50.820]  been trying to convince higher-ups for years that we need to slow down and fix
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:55.900]  things and and the other part I heard was that a lot of this was catching
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:40:01.660]  higher-ups by surprise yeah that that they thought they were doing better than
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:05.860]  what I thought and it would a lot of other people thought and and there this
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:09.420]  is very much a metrics driven company I would go even further than that and I
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:14.020]  I've what I heard wasn't just that that side of the company thought they were
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:18.620]  doing better than what you and others were and yeah I hear you that's right
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:23.940]  they they honestly and truly believed believed and maybe still continued
[02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:27.260]  believe that they're doing better on software quality than ever before in the
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:30.620]  company's history not just that they were doing okay that they were doing
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:37.580]  better than ever right and so my concern is is twofold first of all the fact that
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:41.980]  that there's a massive disconnect of opinion there regardless of which side
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:45.420]  is right that shows a problem somewhere on the line that and that should be
[02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:50.500]  considered but my main concern is that we we can see definitely that they are
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:54.820]  way more metrics driven and numbers driven than they have been before that
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:58.660]  you know that is the new culture of Apple you know in the Tim Cook era that's
[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:05.220]  and and the Tim Cook era has brought a lot of positives and this is one that I
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:09.780]  think is is certainly positive in some areas but it also has risks they have to
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:12.740]  look out for and I'm not sure they found the right balance yet one of the biggest
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:17.220]  risks is you got to make sure you're measuring the right numbers you know and
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:21.300]  and you know whatever metrics you are collecting is that the whole picture and
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:26.500]  also whatever metrics you're collecting will first of all they will be gamed by
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:29.700]  internal people within the company like internal departments will gain the
[02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:32.820]  metrics because they have to because that's the pressure that is put on them
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:35.860]  and when they have to start making decisions about difficult things to cut
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:40.020]  or to put off or whatever you know they know what metrics they're judged on and
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:44.700]  so people will gain metrics that's it's the way that you know and I know you're
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:49.620]  not a big sports fan but it's the reason that every single team sport with a ball
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:55.220]  has what seems to be from an outsider a complex set of rules I get the more you
[02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:58.620]  learn about baseball the more you think these rules are crazy but it's all about
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:03.100]  the fact that if the game is about you know how many people cross home plate
[02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:07.940]  and touch home plate that if these rules weren't in place people teams would do
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:13.340]  whatever they could within the rules that are in place to game the game right
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:17.740]  everything gets gamed you're exactly right and you know that ties into the
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:24.060]  advertising discussion we had four hours ago right so I do worry that if Apple is
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:29.460]  is putting all this emphasis internally on metrics I wonder what they're missing
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:33.620]  and because we we've seen already you know with the with the high ground thing
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:36.940]  we've seen that there are things they're missing and that they need to be shown
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:40.020]  that sometimes from the outside and and part of the reason why I complain so
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:44.180]  much about certain things Apple does is because I know that that outside voices
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:49.220]  like ours can affect things internally usually whatever we are arguing about
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:53.820]  outside somebody inside is arguing about too I think there's outside support for
[02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:56.660]  one viewpoint or the other we could you know you we can be giving ammunition to
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:59.980]  the side that we want to win the fight yeah I think that the whole discovery D
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:06.660]  thing was a perfect example of the type of thing that slipped through their
[02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:09.940]  metrics I mean one of the things I know that they specifically were thinking
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:14.060]  about were crash reports and that there's this whole opt-in system that
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:17.620]  Apple I think is very very upfront about and in fact there may even be too
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:21.660]  upfront about it because and when you upgrade your OS on systems you have to
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:25.220]  always re-opt into these things they might even ask they might they might
[02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:28.380]  even err on the side of asking too many times you know you sure you want to let
[02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:32.100]  us have location services enabled on this device even if you said it already
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:35.060]  you've just upgraded to a major new version of the OS they're gonna ask you
[02:43:35.060 --> 02:43:41.780]  again so they they know that most of an overwhelming majority of users on the
[02:43:41.780 --> 02:43:47.220]  Mac or Mac and iOS opt-in to the will you send us you know the crash reports
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:52.580]  and stuff like that for helping us make things better and that's one of the
[02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:56.500]  things that they've measured and one of the things that they know has gone way
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:03.020]  down in recent years is apps crashing I anecdotally that feels true to me as
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:07.940]  well that on my Mac fewer and fewer apps crash in terms of just disappearing and
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:13.100]  getting the and especially if I didn't anecdote again I'm not measuring
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:17.500]  statistic I'm thinking about just in my mind almost all the crashes I see
[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:21.100]  nowadays on my Mac are from beta software that I'm testing and that I
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:28.060]  expect to crash it feels to me like apps crash less especially apples apps yeah
[02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:31.900]  I'd say you're right and the whole discovery D thing all of the various
[02:44:31.900 --> 02:44:35.860]  problems that people have seen from it are the type of things that there aren't
[02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:40.300]  crashes they're just exactly weird silent failures you know like when the
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:45.180]  printer that I've been using for the last four years and it's the only
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:50.220]  printer I use and I hit command P and nothing ever comes out of it and I go
[02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:54.340]  over to the thing with a red badge in my dock and it just says printer cannot be
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:45:00.460]  found and I go to this thing and the system settings and try to configure the
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:05.900]  printer and I can't configure it and I just sit here and I see if Amy can print
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:09.620]  and she can print but I can't it doesn't even see the printer and then I just
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:15.060]  turn the printer off and on and back on again and now it all just works but I
[02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:18.700]  haven't updated anything on my printer that's for damn sure the printer hasn't
[02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:24.060]  changed at all that never gets reported to Apple that never you know there is no
[02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:29.540]  crash log that gets sent there is no I you know Siri heard John cursing in his
[02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:34.900]  office about the fucking printer that never it doesn't register right and
[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:38.180]  that's the sort of thing that you just kind of have to you kind of have to play
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:42.660]  by feel and internally you have to be like hey guys this is a shit show this
[02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:49.420]  my Apple TV is keeps calling itself Apple TV parentheses 13 right and that
[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:53.300]  and playing it by feel that as we all know that was one of Steve's greatest
[02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:57.020]  strengths that he was like he was really on point and yeah he wasn't always
[02:45:57.020 --> 02:46:02.260]  perfect but his track record was pretty good in playing it by feel and and so
[02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:06.340]  you know when when you move to this metric system you have to both a make
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:09.660]  you know you have to be on the lookout for gaming and try to reduce it or
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:13.300]  eliminate the incentives for it we were never possible and that's that's an
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:18.060]  ongoing constant constant battle and B you have to really make you have to look
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:23.540]  at like what do the metrics not include what what where are the blind spots of
[02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:27.180]  these metrics of these metrics and every set of metrics is gonna have massive
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:31.780]  blind spots right and and that is where I think there is still room for
[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:35.740]  improvement there and so if Apple is measuring their their beloved customer
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:43.420]  sat in in ways that that showed that 16 gig is is not a problem for most of the
[02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:47.300]  people who have it I mean you know they have a what they have way more data than
[02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:51.140]  we do so they could be right that could be true most of the things Apple says
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:55.180]  are you know on our surface level on the face of it true like they you know
[02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:57.940]  they're you know like like my blog post like there was no deeper meaning like
[02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:00.840]  most of the things as you always say most of the Apple says are pretty
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:05.220]  straightforward and true but this is one of those cases where if they keep saying
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:10.860]  that 16 gig is fine and that people are happy enough with it that is in really
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:18.580]  stark contrast and disagreement to what I and everyone I know sees anecdotally
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:23.620]  from our friends and relatives who have 16 gig phones and and like I love like
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:27.180]  when underscore David Smith put posted his analysis of like free space I have
[02:47:27.180 --> 02:47:30.460]  that right everything yep yeah that was that was great because that shows like
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:35.980]  actual broad data set from people who aren't all nerds who have you know like
[02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:39.180]  how much free space they actually have and how many and you know we all
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:42.460]  everyone who has been around other people with iPhones we've all known
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:46.140]  people who like oh they go to take a picture on their phones full or they
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:48.780]  keep it in the message that their phone is full or their iCloud storage is full
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:52.580]  and they have no idea what to do about that exactly and and you know iOS
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:57.060]  storage management has never been pretty particularly easy or obvious and how to
[02:47:57.060 --> 02:48:01.300]  do it you know there's all these all these problems people have people who
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:06.140]  are stuck on old OS's like that I think they learned big time with how low the
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:09.740]  adoption rate was of iOS 8 compared to previous releases because they had all
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:12.860]  these 8 and 16 gig phones out there that didn't have enough space to install it
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:17.180]  and they just never people just never installed it I would say actually I
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:21.020]  think that the way that iOS deals with storage now in terms of dealing with a
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:24.420]  low storage situation is actually better than it's ever been and better than
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:28.700]  anything on the Mac and in terms because the Mac you're dealing with the finder
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:33.820]  and you've already lost most people yes file system we've lost them and so the
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:37.420]  way that you can go into settings now and if you at least Google enough you
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:41.260]  can probably get someone to tell you you know go to settings go to general go to
[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:45.500]  usage and it'll show you which apps are using how much data and then you can do
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:48.660]  something right there and deal with it that's actually pretty good I think it's
[02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:53.540]  about as good just blaming the whole app you know here this app is using four
[02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:58.380]  gigabytes is about as good as it's gonna get from for mass-market typical people
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:01.780]  but you most people aren't gonna get that far like I just linked to a thing
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:06.500]  before we started recording today that around the world there's like five or
[02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:10.980]  six percent of Facebook users don't know that they're using the internet when
[02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:15.180]  they use Facebook that's great that you go around and pull people and and they
[02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:19.920]  say how much do you use the internet and you get you know it's 40% and then do
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:24.860]  you use Facebook and it's like 60% well how is that that's not really possible
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:29.540]  they're obviously misinformed but if you're surprised that there are that
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:34.080]  many people who don't realize that Facebook is on the internet you really
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:38.900]  just don't understand how untechnical people are you know and it's is not
[02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:42.340]  doesn't even say that they're not intelligent they just don't they might
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:45.840]  be unintelligent but it might just be that they are not technically inclined
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:50.280]  and it also might be the decreasing relevance of the web I didn't say that
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:54.940]  very possible very possible like that they and and and combine that with the
[02:49:54.940 --> 02:50:01.140]  age-old genius of Microsoft branding their browser Internet Explorer which
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:06.580]  made people think that that was the internet which was very purposeful and
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:11.860]  again it's tied into like the whole Joe camel marketing angle you know marketing
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:16.300]  is evil you know from earlier in the show that was very deliberate and then
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:19.380]  they know they're not using the thing that's the internet because they're not
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:23.460]  using the browser and so therefore they're not using the internet that's
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:26.920]  just that's just the loose way people think about things and it speaks to the
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:32.140]  genius of modern smartphones that they're able to do so much and share so
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:37.180]  much and be so engaged by not really understanding the underlying technology
[02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:41.780]  at all but you know therefore if you're surprised that people some number of
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:46.460]  people buy 16 gigabyte phones and have no idea that they're selling you know
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:50.940]  they're doing themselves a great disservice it's not their fault they
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:54.020]  that this is the bottom line the thing that gets people upset like you say and
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:56.700]  people I know there's people there's people who are out there it's rage
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:51:01.220]  swearing at us listening to the podcast saying you know my company by 16
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:05.300]  gigabyte phones and they're just fine because we do blah blah blah if Apple
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:08.260]  wants to sell them to the enterprise fine sell them directly to the
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:12.300]  enterprise but don't sell them in retail stores to consumers because like
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:17.300]  underscores data shows that somewhere around 37% of those people have at least
[02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:20.860]  his users of his app but I think it's very very possible that that's let's
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:25.340]  call it one in three so we'll even err on the you know underscore says 37 we'll
[02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:31.180]  call it 33 1% of the people with 16 gigabytes iPhones have under 1 gigabyte
[02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:34.540]  of space available which is really really and some of them have you know
[02:51:34.540 --> 02:51:39.980]  really low mounts under 1 gigabyte but if you don't even have 1 gigabyte
[02:51:39.980 --> 02:51:44.020]  available you're really in trouble for a lot of little things yeah like a lot of
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:47.220]  things just start failing for you at that point right like having the room to
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:52.660]  download 150 megabyte podcast that you want to listen to or to record video
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:55.460]  like the the thing that he showed that his wife got when she took out the
[02:51:55.460 --> 02:51:59.900]  camera and she could not record video because there wasn't enough space and
[02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:04.860]  you know it it it really bites you and then the other thing you look at in his
[02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:09.380]  stats is so the next step up now is 64 and you look at how many people with 64
[02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:13.140]  gigabyte phones have storage problems and it's effectively none of them yeah I
[02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:17.300]  mean and the sad thing is you know I've heard rumblings here and there from
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:22.100]  various tipsters some of which have no credibility I've heard rumblings that
[02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:26.660]  they are finally going to fix this next year and with the iPhone 7 it's going to
[02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:33.540]  start at either 32 or even 64 right I worry though like by the time if they
[02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:39.180]  ever move up to 32 maybe that's gonna be too small by that point right you know
[02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:42.460]  because you know the point of this it's very much like when when you're
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:46.640]  designing a an app with a paywall and I have this in overcast you know when
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:50.140]  you're doing an app with a paywall of some sort whether it's a free trial with
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:57.220]  you know shareware style unlock all features whatever the idea is to put
[02:52:57.220 --> 02:53:02.420]  that wall at a threshold such that you're creating a small pain point for
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:07.100]  people so that they won't like frustratingly quit your app and say well
[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:11.420]  this is useless I can't even try it but you have to create that pain that pain
[02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:16.140]  point at such a place where most people will reasonably run into it a few times
[02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:21.340]  and a good percentage of those people will run into it enough that it pushes
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:26.900]  them it motivates them into paying and I use the term pain point here
[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:31.700]  intentionally like this is like you're causing like inconvenience or you're
[02:53:31.700 --> 02:53:34.820]  making people like hidden hit a wall that's unpleasant they want to go past
[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:39.740]  because if you don't do that if you are too generous with what you give away for
[02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:43.460]  free effectively nobody buys upgrade this is one of the things like apps that
[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:48.820]  have ads by default and you can pay to remove the ads historically those have
[02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:52.740]  very very low payment rates almost no you know effectively almost nobody pays
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:57.740]  to remove ads I always I always I always me too but we're weird you know most
[02:53:57.740 --> 02:54:01.340]  people are just like well okay I'll take the ads like that isn't enough of a pain
[02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:05.500]  point or if you say like you know suppose suppose you know you're you're
[02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:10.860]  supposed with the overcast if I said well in order to subscribe to more than
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:16.300]  three three podcasts you have to unlock the the pay thing well most people
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:19.980]  subscribe to like two podcasts or one and a half podcasts something about an
[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:23.980]  average so hardly anybody would even would even hit that and then I would
[02:54:23.980 --> 02:54:27.940]  create this horrible incentive for people not to try out new shows right so
[02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:31.420]  so like that's why I don't limit that you know I limit other things but I
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:36.700]  don't limit that and so you know with Apple you know when they're pricing
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:40.740]  their products when they're designing the the tiers of deciding what what the
[02:54:40.740 --> 02:54:44.520]  storage tiers or whatever the the product lines you know where it is the
[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:48.180]  mini run into the air where does the air now run into the pro we're on the
[02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:50.700]  MacBooks how do you know where do the size boundaries lie and what
[02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:55.660]  capabilities do you have to move up to get at each stage like all these things
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:59.500]  are designed to try to place those those barriers and those limits and those
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:03.860]  boundaries between classes or between price levels try to place them at a
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:08.980]  point where you're going to capture a lot more value from a lot of people who
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:12.580]  are going to hit those barriers and are going to want to push past them by
[02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:17.020]  paying you more money that is the whole point if they if if Apple did their job
[02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:21.300]  badly they would give away too much for free at the low end but Apple tries to
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:25.900]  do their job well and they are very very good at that most of the time and so so
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:31.420]  when app like these these storage tiers are designed specifically to maximize
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:36.820]  that look at the iPad and the iPad Pro I was just about 32 and 128 right and the
[02:55:36.820 --> 02:55:41.460]  128 is cellular only or it's only available in the 128 right right so like
[02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:45.700]  so there's only three available you can for 799 I think it's 799 I'm looking at
[02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:50.460]  my notes yeah I think you're 799 you can get a 32 gigabyte no cellular for 949
[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:58.900]  you can get 128 gigs no cellular and then for 1079 they're their usual $130
[02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:02.820]  upgrade for the cellular you can get 128 and cellular those are the only three
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:06.580]  configurations available I actually think that's great I think it's great
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:10.020]  that it's a lot simpler that you don't have three storage tiers it's just two
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:13.900]  do you want the real one and let's face it the real one is the 128 do you want
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:20.740]  cellular or not and the 32 totally makes sense in the context of industrial uses
[02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:26.380]  of the iPad Pro like for the enterprise right and like single app uses yeah and
[02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:29.700]  like I was talking to dr. wave from Pixar you know and they even publicized
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:32.900]  this is public information it's not secret that Apple was there at Pixar
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:37.580]  last week and letting their artists play with them and use them and and test the
[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:41.660]  palm rejection which they were very pleased with I say very pleased that
[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:46.540]  they called it like near perfect but like I said to him I was like I'll bet
[02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:49.180]  that the 32 is the one you guys are gonna buy you know yeah of course cuz
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:52.220]  they don't store anything on that on that right it's all connected to their
[02:56:52.220 --> 02:56:56.140]  little internal internet and it's all stored on the servers and and so that
[02:56:56.140 --> 02:56:59.140]  they can share it and it's all there so you know the extra storage would be
[02:56:59.140 --> 02:57:03.980]  completely and utterly wasted on them and it's also the lack of cellular is a
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:07.420]  feature because they don't want these things connected to cellular networks
[02:57:07.420 --> 02:57:11.500]  they want them connected only to their little internal network like I didn't
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:14.580]  even talk to him about this but I know in the movie industry in general that
[02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:18.180]  whole thing where Sony got hacked has really really upped their game on
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:22.260]  security and places like hospitals and stuff like that with all the HIPAA laws
[02:57:22.260 --> 02:57:27.220]  you know this configuration is perfect for them it is not you know if you're a
[02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:30.700]  consumer though you want the 128 and you probably want the one with cellular
[02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:37.420]  yeah and I think it's very obvious and also the the low-end model 32 is a great
[02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:41.580]  little low-end thing where there's still plenty of space for things like software
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:44.760]  updates and temporary caches and big files and stuff like that whereas like a
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.420]  16 gigabyte model on that would have been like it just would be terrible yeah
[02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:53.060]  and like I like you know if I if I end up having to get one for various testing
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:57.180]  purposes I would get 32 because I wouldn't be like a power user of that
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:58:02.380]  right that feels like it's okay but just barely like it does feel kind of weird
[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:08.420]  to spend nine hundred eight hundred dollars on this high-end thing and then
[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:15.540]  to not spend the extra 150 or whatever to quadruple the storage because this
[02:58:15.540 --> 02:58:18.620]  is the kind of thing you can never change you can never upgrade that
[02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:24.000]  storage the other way or like it's you can't undo that decision and and they
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.580]  know that when they're pricing it and when they're deciding these they know
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:30.620]  that and they know that a certain percentage of people usually I would
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:34.700]  expect a pretty significant one will rationalize that same thought of well
[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:39.540]  I'm already spending 800 if I go up to 950 I'll quadruple this thing that might
[02:58:39.540 --> 02:58:42.700]  be a problem for me in the future if I don't do it you know like that and same
[02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:45.300]  thing with adding Apple care everything else this is how retailers always work
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:50.660]  this is this is business so all this is a very long way to say I definitely
[02:58:50.660 --> 02:58:55.060]  still believe that these 16 gig phones are a decision to raise average selling
[02:58:55.060 --> 02:59:00.460]  price not because it is best for customers and and that I don't
[02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:05.820]  necessarily even I'm not even that mad at them about it because you know that's
[02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:08.860]  just that's business that's that's that's the kind of decision that they
[02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:13.620]  have to make to be successful and every business person does this and you know
[02:59:13.620 --> 02:59:17.900]  Apple is not you know Santa Claus like they you know they they're a business
[02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:21.460]  and and they're gonna make money off of us and and we happily keep giving it to
[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:24.620]  them and so they're obviously doing something right the only the one and
[02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:27.260]  last thing I want a point I want to make about this the other thing that that
[02:59:27.260 --> 02:59:33.860]  causes me to think about it a lot is that it's that it lad that the
[02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:39.180]  repercussions of this last for at least three years because what it means is
[02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:44.620]  that next year the mid-tier phone is going to be a 16 gigabyte start at a 16
[02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:49.820]  gigabyte iPhone 6s and then two years from now the free free with contract
[02:59:49.820 --> 02:59:55.020]  $99 phone is going to be the iPhone 6s with 16 gigabytes so there's going to be
[02:59:55.020 --> 03:00:00.460]  brand new iPhones that some people are buying with 16 gigabytes for at least
[03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:05.320]  the next three years oh yeah I mean they've been selling eights at the low
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:10.260]  end I think right I don't know if are they still now I think that they were
[03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:14.940]  they were before last week yeah before like they'll sell them the five the 5c
[03:00:14.940 --> 03:00:20.740]  had an 8 gig yeah yeah so you know it's the fact that the minimum when the
[03:00:20.740 --> 03:00:25.840]  iPhone 5c came out was six made it you know it made a difference the minimum
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:30.580]  now at least the minimum in the u.s. is 16 now in the 5s yeah they might sell a
[03:00:30.580 --> 03:00:35.260]  somewhere around the world but yeah you know but that still means though that
[03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:43.500]  it's going to be 16 though for a while exactly I thought I linked to it today
[03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:47.500]  and I don't want to repeat it I just tell people to go live you know because
[03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:50.900]  you and I don't have you know this episode is pretty short so if you still
[03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:54.740]  have a lot of time left for podcasts listening go listen to it's a great
[03:00:54.740 --> 03:00:58.340]  podcast in general but I really thought it was a fantastic episode of upgrade
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:04.060]  with Jason Snell and Mike Hurley and they talked about upgrading to iOS 9 and
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:08.220]  or getting a new phone you buy a new iPhone you have an old iPhone you want
[03:01:08.220 --> 03:01:12.460]  to upgrade from your backup what an enormous pain in the ass that's that
[03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:15.560]  really is and then if anything it's gotten worse over the years because the
[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:19.900]  phones do so much more and ask so much more permission and some of the things I
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:23.140]  totally understand I know it has to be that way it's actually a feature that
[03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:27.540]  you have to redo your fingerprints that's actually good even though it's a
[03:01:27.540 --> 03:01:31.340]  little bit of a pain in the ass you have to re-enter your credit cards I realize
[03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:34.980]  that's actually a feature because the credit card data is stored on a secure
[03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:37.780]  element and if it was a thing that they could just copy from one phone to another
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:41.180]  that wouldn't be a very secure element it's the fact that you it literally
[03:01:41.180 --> 03:01:45.740]  cannot be copied from there to here that's great so some of those things are
[03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:52.700]  obviously it can't be avoided but it takes so long and you and and it's so
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:56.420]  indeterminate what you're waiting for like did you run into the do you upgrade
[03:01:56.420 --> 03:01:59.780]  when you get a new phone do you upgrade from a backup yeah I do I do the iTunes
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:04.660]  encrypted backup and everything this time I I did it mostly seamlessly
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:09.100]  Tiff's phone came with a dead SIM card so we had to swap the sim on that one
[03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:15.140]  and I had I had the endless loop of iCloud authentication dialogues during
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:17.500]  this had a process problem which I've heard a couple people mention that they
[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:21.420]  ran into as well yeah other than that I like you know I did the whole thing
[03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:25.240]  where I don't pair the watch then back up the phone then restore to the new
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:28.900]  phone then repair the watch to the new phone and all they like it but mostly
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:34.380]  okay it's I've gotten this down because and again this is not really a complaint
[03:02:34.380 --> 03:02:39.040]  it's you know it's it's great that I get these review units and from do I get
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.900]  them two weeks early and I get to write about them before other people and I get
[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:45.980]  to spend more time with them but now that they do two new phones a year 5c
[03:02:45.980 --> 03:02:51.660]  5s 6 and 6 plus and the success and 6 plus I get two phones to test so there's
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:54.900]  two phones that I have to go through this with and then I always buy my own I
[03:02:54.900 --> 03:02:58.380]  already have my own I bought my own I don't you know I pay for my own fine I
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:01.940]  personally use iPhone every year so that means I get a period of like three weeks
[03:03:01.940 --> 03:03:07.220]  I do this with three phones every year and then later in the fall I generally
[03:03:07.220 --> 03:03:11.100]  wind up doing it with an iPad too so and then I might buy it I might buy my own
[03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:15.460]  iPad I don't buy a new iPad every year but I at least test one so I I do this
[03:03:15.460 --> 03:03:19.300]  with like five or six devices every year I'll bet there's people within Apple who
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:22.980]  do this more often because they're using test units of the hardware so that
[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:27.020]  people inside Apple have to know this and I think that if you do it like I do
[03:03:27.020 --> 03:03:34.220]  more than once a year you're the inadequacies of this system are in your
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:39.380]  face and I really and and now that they're selling a program to upgrade
[03:03:39.380 --> 03:03:43.100]  every year encouraging people to upgrade every year I really hope that that
[03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:47.540]  somewhere within Apple there's a you know this is a high priority we really
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:53.620]  gotta streamline this one thing I was not a weird but I was I'm sorry for the
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:57.660]  crosstalk but I was not aware that if you do the iCloud backup you still have
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:04:02.900]  to re-enter all your passwords yeah yeah iCloud backup is not it doesn't count as
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:05.180]  encrypted like they don't because they don't want to store your passwords in
[03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:09.740]  iCloud so the iCloud keychain I think is gonna be their long-term solution around
[03:04:09.740 --> 03:04:12.620]  that which doesn't throw the password like it always keeps it on one device
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:15.740]  right it doesn't actually that's why you have to like go to another device to
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:19.780]  approve it right but no so that's probably the long-term goal with that
[03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:24.300]  but I think one thing that is very obvious here first of all is that like
[03:04:24.300 --> 03:04:28.180]  once again like sometimes sometimes stuff about the Apple watch kind of
[03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:31.640]  seems like it was developed like on a spaceship away from Apple like like it
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:34.740]  just kind of got handed to them when it was done like there's certain things
[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:38.360]  about it they're just like this is obviously like the rest of the company
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:42.300]  didn't see this or approve this before they got out or like where did this come
[03:04:42.300 --> 03:04:46.380]  from you know so there's certain things about and I think obviously the way the
[03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:52.140]  Apple watch deals with backing itself up to the iPhone and and moving it to a
[03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:59.100]  different phone it's very on Apple like if I can use that generalization is is
[03:04:59.100 --> 03:05:02.980]  very much like this does not seem like it was well you know Apple's whole thing
[03:05:02.980 --> 03:05:06.420]  is like the integration top to bottom they make everything they make the
[03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:08.620]  software they make the hardware they make the services they make everything
[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:15.900]  the way the Apple watch pairs and backs up to a phone or doesn't rather is it
[03:05:15.900 --> 03:05:21.740]  just seems like this like thing that was tacked on and it was not thought of with
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:25.340]  you know with integration in mind with the whole stack in mind with with what
[03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:30.140]  happens with your phone upgrade in mind and that seems like a massive oversight
[03:05:30.140 --> 03:05:34.300]  and hopefully that's because it's a 1.0 and they'll get to it because it does
[03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:41.020]  seem really weird that like by default your watch is not backing up to your
[03:05:41.020 --> 03:05:46.020]  phone ever it seems it doesn't only do it when you unpair it I think so yeah
[03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:54.340]  and if you so if you like wipe your old phone and while in the process of I it's
[03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:58.820]  very easy to end up as a as an ideal Apple customer meaning ideal from
[03:05:58.820 --> 03:06:02.220]  Apple's perspective you're a big fan and when they when they release new things
[03:06:02.220 --> 03:06:05.140]  you just go out and buy them so you've already got an Apple watch and you're
[03:06:05.140 --> 03:06:10.980]  buying a new iPhone it's very very easy to wind up like like with a default
[03:06:10.980 --> 03:06:15.660]  factory installed watch again and like losing your activity data yeah and that's
[03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:20.620]  that's a major like that could like as as a slacker who like barely holds
[03:06:20.620 --> 03:06:24.940]  together an exercise regime here like if I lost all my activity data that's a
[03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:28.660]  major demotivator to keep going because it's the whole point I get to the idea
[03:06:28.660 --> 03:06:32.740]  that I've got this streak going that yeah the motivator yeah like that should
[03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:36.980]  not be taken as lightly you know temporary data and with all of hell kid
[03:06:36.980 --> 03:06:43.900]  is about like how how crazy is it that the watch a doesn't seem to back itself
[03:06:43.900 --> 03:06:48.780]  up at all and B when it does back itself up it doesn't back up to iCloud it backs
[03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:54.140]  up to just that local phone right that is crazy well like they iCloud has
[03:06:54.140 --> 03:06:57.820]  existed for a long time iCloud backups have existed for a long time before the
[03:06:57.820 --> 03:07:03.300]  watch why doesn't the watch regularly at night when it's plugged in just like the
[03:07:03.300 --> 03:07:07.540]  phone back itself up to iCloud and you don't have like one of the benefits of
[03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:11.260]  the watch is that you just don't have much user-created data it's not even
[03:07:11.260 --> 03:07:15.060]  possible to have a lot of user-created data that you know but the stuff that is
[03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:18.860]  there the metrics you know biometrics and stuff like the fact that it's not
[03:07:18.860 --> 03:07:23.460]  and and it's even just your settings and stuff it's annoying to lose all that
[03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:28.620]  stuff if you understand how it works it makes sense why you have to first
[03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:32.820]  unpair it with the old phone and then and then it makes sense why the unpair
[03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:38.180]  takes five minutes because that's when the backup takes place right so why does
[03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:41.180]  it take five minutes to unpair your iPhone well because that's when it backs
[03:07:41.180 --> 03:07:45.260]  up so that you can then restore it when you're done you know like oh well then
[03:07:45.260 --> 03:07:48.860]  that makes some sense doesn't make you say well that's a that's a clever design
[03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:52.900]  it just makes you say okay that's why it takes but if you don't know that why in
[03:07:52.900 --> 03:07:56.260]  the world would you ever unpair it first why wouldn't you think as an Apple
[03:07:56.260 --> 03:08:01.140]  customer I mean I think it makes total customer common sense that you would
[03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:04.060]  just think I bought a new iPhone I already have an Apple watch I'm gonna
[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:07.740]  restore from a backup and then my new phone will be paired with my Apple watch
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:12.700]  yeah that is what like you can totally see a bunch of people making that
[03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:16.300]  assumption totally reasonably right and then if it like popped up and said you
[03:08:16.300 --> 03:08:19.100]  know do you want to switch your Apple watch your Apple watch can only be
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:23.180]  paired with one iPhone at a time would you like to switch to this new iPhone
[03:08:23.180 --> 03:08:28.780]  yes please okay and then you would expect that to maybe spin for a couple
[03:08:28.780 --> 03:08:32.300]  of seconds and then it would just work
[03:08:32.660 --> 03:08:38.380]  yeah that this whole process it's you it seemed like it's very much a 1.0
[03:08:38.380 --> 03:08:42.220]  process which is it isn't unfortunately with with the rest of the phone and the
[03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:47.900]  the the sad part of this to me that the discouraging part of this to me is that
[03:08:47.900 --> 03:08:54.260]  most of this rests on the the parts of Apple's infrastructure that I think have
[03:08:54.260 --> 03:09:00.380]  the most problems usually it's like the the store infrastructure not even not
[03:09:00.380 --> 03:09:06.500]  not necessarily like all of iCloud but like the the backup and purchases part
[03:09:06.500 --> 03:09:09.460]  of it I think is really unrelated especially the purchase I mean this all
[03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:13.300]  goes back to the store I hate the store this like that whole infrastructure
[03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:19.260]  seems like it has frequent problems and frequent bugs and and all of this seems
[03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:27.940]  to rest on that and iTunes yay right so I I actually don't have incredibly high
[03:09:27.940 --> 03:09:32.740]  hopes of this improving it's also it's it's also just very complex you know
[03:09:32.740 --> 03:09:35.580]  like the way the way Apple designs things as you said like you know with
[03:09:35.580 --> 03:09:39.900]  with the privacy in mind and with the security that they do a lot of these
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:43.460]  things aren't possible to make significantly better you know like a lot
[03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:45.900]  of it like you know you you can't just transfer it for a touch ID in your
[03:09:45.900 --> 03:09:50.020]  credit card data because it doesn't you you actually can't do it with security
[03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:53.820]  and designs that they have stuff like that like a lot of this stuff works in
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:58.780]  ways like that where the answer is just well to make this better we would have
[03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:01.740]  to become Google and we're not gonna do that so it's just not gonna get better
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:05.860]  yeah and like for example like the one that you mentioned a couple minutes ago
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:09.580]  I know I saw it at least one of the times I was upgrading a phone the last
[03:10:09.580 --> 03:10:15.580]  few weeks I know other people have seen it is this loop seeming loop of requests
[03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:22.620]  for your iCloud password yeah and you know and and it it just seems like I
[03:10:22.620 --> 03:10:26.980]  it's so indeterminate was I entering it wrong I often do enter it wrong because
[03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:30.500]  entering a password on that little keyboard and all you see are the bullets
[03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:35.060]  it's very easy to make a mistake so I'm pretty sure I haven't nailed down I've
[03:10:35.060 --> 03:10:37.900]  now seen this about three or four times and various free stores and everything
[03:10:37.900 --> 03:10:41.620]  and I'm pretty sure it's related to two-factor authentication because what
[03:10:41.620 --> 03:10:46.700]  it seems like it's doing is something is checking for your password very early on
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:50.220]  in the activation while the white screen is still up and it is before the
[03:10:50.220 --> 03:10:55.580]  two-factor authorization is requested properly in that screen so you can type
[03:10:55.580 --> 03:10:58.980]  in the right credentials and it's failing because lacking two-factor I
[03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:02.180]  think you're wrong or at least there's a way to get into it without two-factor
[03:11:02.180 --> 03:11:07.940]  because I don't have two-factor on because it's okay I don't maybe I should
[03:11:07.940 --> 03:11:12.740]  but probably well I don't because it seems like two-factor is such a pain in
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:16.020]  the ass and I don't want to go through it with all these iPhones I register
[03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:22.140]  every year but I don't have it turned on I'm on my one Apple ID and I know that
[03:11:22.140 --> 03:11:26.020]  I've seen this loop where I think I must have entered the password wrong because
[03:11:26.020 --> 03:11:30.140]  it keeps asking me and then I do it very very carefully painstaking character at
[03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:34.540]  a time character at a time and it still does it and then I think well is it the
[03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:39.580]  same service is it like six different services are queued up to get my Apple ID
[03:11:39.580 --> 03:11:45.300]  and they can't share it because they're so siloed within the system or is it a
[03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:49.220]  bug is it should I keep entering it that's the question I think am I
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:53.460]  supposed to keep entering this or am I just going in a circle here where it's
[03:11:53.460 --> 03:11:58.020]  never gonna stop oh see well so see when I when I enter it in this loop it
[03:11:58.020 --> 03:12:01.740]  actually then shows me a second dialogue saying authorization failed oh it's
[03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:04.940]  actually telling me it is failing and then so I'll just keep hitting cancel
[03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:08.060]  cancel cancel on the next few of them and it's like an infinite alert box in
[03:12:08.060 --> 03:12:11.340]  JavaScript like it you just can't you have to like hit cancel fast enough and
[03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:14.780]  then like between boxes you gotta like hit the next stage of this of the screen
[03:12:14.780 --> 03:12:18.380]  like go to the next screen and get past that it's really terrible I what I've
[03:12:18.380 --> 03:12:21.860]  seen is it doesn't even tell you that it failed it just asks again as though it's
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:25.900]  asking for the first time over and over and over again and usually it helps to
[03:12:25.900 --> 03:12:31.700]  power down the phone and power it back on or my go-to thing which works for a
[03:12:31.700 --> 03:12:36.780]  lot of these things is to sign out and sign back in which can be a huge pain in
[03:12:36.780 --> 03:12:40.140]  the ass because you lose you know it then it's like yeah you know all your
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:42.820]  contacts are gone you have to wait for them to resync down and stuff and now
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:45.620]  you're losing your photos your music like now it now everything's tied in
[03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:51.000]  right but anyway the whole process is is not good and I really think that they
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:54.780]  ought to improve that and I worry my big concern is that maybe at the executive
[03:12:54.780 --> 03:12:57.780]  level they've got people who set their phones up for them and so they don't see
[03:12:57.780 --> 03:13:03.020]  it and then maybe they can hear the complaints but it's one of those things
[03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:05.980]  we're hearing that complaint ah come on it took you half an hour to set up your
[03:13:05.980 --> 03:13:10.340]  phone big deal it's very different than if if they had to see it I just can't
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:14.220]  help but feel that if you know Tim Cook or Phil Schiller or Johnny I've went
[03:13:14.220 --> 03:13:16.540]  through what I've gone through with some of these new iPhones this year
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:21.380]  personally that they would be like this this this needs a swift kick in the ass
[03:13:21.380 --> 03:13:28.660]  yeah somebody's throwing a phone on a fish tank that's as good a place as the
[03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:34.580]  any to end we've gone on plenty long enough let me thank our sponsors often
[03:13:34.580 --> 03:13:37.560]  forget to do this into the show but I won't this time our sponsors this week
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:42.660]  fracture people who make the pictures igloo the internet you'll actually like
