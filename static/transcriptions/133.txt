[00:00.000 --> 00:06.060]  All right, no jackhammers, no lawn instruments.
[00:06.060 --> 00:07.060]  Thank God.
[00:07.060 --> 00:09.220]  That was the funniest coincidence ever.
[00:09.220 --> 00:11.220]  So anyway, Serenity Caldwell is here.
[00:11.220 --> 00:16.820]  Yesterday we tried to record this episode and I had a jackhammer outside my window.
[00:16.820 --> 00:23.980]  When that stopped, a lawn crew showed up outside Serenity's window with a riding mower.
[00:23.980 --> 00:27.220]  The biggest lawn mower I have ever seen for a portable lawn crew.
[00:27.220 --> 00:31.820]  It was quite something, but not very conducive to podcasting.
[00:31.820 --> 00:36.780]  What that big John Deere that Tony Stark was supposed to fix.
[00:36.780 --> 00:37.780]  Never did.
[00:37.780 --> 00:38.780]  Yeah, pretty much that.
[00:38.780 --> 00:40.580]  Only noisier and louder.
[00:40.580 --> 00:45.660]  That's right, he never did fix the lawn mower, the tractor, whatever it is.
[00:45.660 --> 00:47.460]  The McGuffin tractor.
[00:47.460 --> 00:48.460]  Right.
[00:48.460 --> 00:51.780]  So, I don't know, a lot's going on.
[00:51.780 --> 00:56.260]  New iMacs, no new MacBooks though.
[00:56.260 --> 00:57.260]  No new MacBooks.
[00:57.260 --> 00:59.340]  They are still on the watch list.
[00:59.340 --> 01:01.820]  I don't know if we'll get new MacBooks before the end of the year.
[01:01.820 --> 01:02.820]  I would have guessed.
[01:02.820 --> 01:05.540]  I think if we would have, it would have happened all at once.
[01:05.540 --> 01:06.540]  Yeah.
[01:06.540 --> 01:07.540]  Yeah.
[01:07.540 --> 01:08.540]  I don't see it.
[01:08.540 --> 01:10.980]  There's no need to have a third non-existent event.
[01:10.980 --> 01:13.540]  This is where being a podcaster, I'm starting to get lazy.
[01:13.540 --> 01:16.780]  I am not super well informed on the new iMacs.
[01:16.780 --> 01:17.780]  Are you?
[01:17.780 --> 01:18.780]  Yeah.
[01:18.780 --> 01:19.780]  I mean, I'm fairly-
[01:19.780 --> 01:21.780]  It's good that you're here.
[01:21.780 --> 01:23.980]  I got you covered, John.
[01:23.980 --> 01:30.020]  Renee got the information a little bit early and was able to basically give me an FAQ of
[01:30.020 --> 01:31.740]  epic proportions to fill out.
[01:31.740 --> 01:38.300]  So we've got new 21.5-inch iMacs is the biggest news, and they are 4K Retina.
[01:38.300 --> 01:44.420]  It's only, like the original 27-inch iMac, it's only the top-end model that's Retina,
[01:44.420 --> 01:51.880]  so you can still get 21.5-inch iMacs that are your normal poorer than average resolution
[01:51.880 --> 01:56.060]  quality in comparison to the rest of the Mac and iOS line.
[01:56.060 --> 02:04.960]  But those started, I think, 1499 and 4K or slightly more than 4K, I think it's like 4K.5
[02:04.960 --> 02:08.780]  with improved color definition.
[02:08.780 --> 02:13.220]  They're using the same, I don't know the phrase off the top of my head, because I'm a bad
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.560]  film student, but they're basically using the same color profiles as you would with
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.100]  the digital projectors, so it allows it to be more true-to-life when you're editing,
[02:22.100 --> 02:24.980]  when you're color correcting both video and photography.
[02:24.980 --> 02:27.140]  And the 27-inch iMacs get that too.
[02:27.140 --> 02:34.940]  They don't get a boost above their 5K, they're still 5K and magical and far too able to just
[02:34.940 --> 02:36.980]  get sucked into their beautiful screen.
[02:36.980 --> 02:42.740]  But they also have improved color definition, and they get Skylake, Intel's next-generation
[02:42.740 --> 02:45.700]  processor, which has been a long time coming.
[02:45.700 --> 02:53.740]  But no Thunderbolt 3, and the 21.5-inch iMacs are still stuck on Broadwell because the integrated
[02:53.740 --> 02:59.300]  Intel processor, the graphics processor, doesn't play nice with Skylake yet because roadmaps.
[02:59.300 --> 03:06.060]  Yeah, so now my year-old 5K iMac that I'm looking at is outdated.
[03:06.060 --> 03:07.060]  A little bit outdated.
[03:07.060 --> 03:11.580]  I was actually, I was looking at some of the, I think Jason Snell's review had initial benchmarks
[03:11.580 --> 03:18.580]  from Geekbench, and it was saying, oh yeah, the new 21.5-inch iMac outpaces some 5K 27-inch
[03:18.580 --> 03:19.580]  iMacs.
[03:19.580 --> 03:22.260]  And I'm like, I guess I'm kind of glad I waited now.
[03:22.260 --> 03:28.820]  So yeah, I'm still, I'm going to go in for the 21.5-inch, so the 27-inch is still going
[03:28.820 --> 03:33.140]  to kick my bacon with fancy Skylake mumble-dee-jumble.
[03:33.140 --> 03:35.620]  Yeah, I don't feel too bad about it though.
[03:35.620 --> 03:36.620]  I mean, it's inevitable.
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.260]  It's got a whole year as the king of the hill.
[03:39.260 --> 03:40.260]  Exactly.
[03:40.260 --> 03:46.140]  But I still subscribe to the, I like to buy a Mac, max it out, and then use it for years
[03:46.140 --> 03:47.140]  until it gets low.
[03:47.140 --> 03:52.100]  Because I still find, even with Dropbox and iCloud and other things, I still find that
[03:52.100 --> 03:55.980]  it takes me forever to get a Mac set up just the way I want it.
[03:55.980 --> 04:00.500]  Yeah, even, I mean, it's gotten a lot better than it used to be, where I still remember
[04:00.500 --> 04:05.940]  the days of just having to clone my hard drive because the idea of reinstalling all of my
[04:05.940 --> 04:10.580]  applications and tweaking my preferences just made me want to throw up.
[04:10.580 --> 04:13.060]  But yeah, I feel the same way.
[04:13.060 --> 04:21.040]  I still have a 2008 MacBook Pro, unibody MacBook Pro, that I put an SSD in three years ago,
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.900]  and it's still almost as fast as my MacBook Air.
[04:23.900 --> 04:29.660]  I mean, it's a pain in the butt because it's 15 inches and it's not really a super portable
[04:29.660 --> 04:33.540]  machine and it's not retina, but it's still one of those things where I'm like, well,
[04:33.540 --> 04:37.380]  it's still perfectly good and it's still fast.
[04:37.380 --> 04:40.820]  I feel weird just being like, no, sorry, you're going to go in a drawer.
[04:40.820 --> 04:41.820]  I'm not going to use you anymore.
[04:41.820 --> 04:43.580]  You really can't do that for an iMac.
[04:43.580 --> 04:44.580]  No.
[04:44.580 --> 04:48.780]  I really, what I did last year when I bought this is I just bought the best one that they
[04:48.780 --> 04:49.780]  would sell me.
[04:49.780 --> 04:55.340]  I just maxed out the RAM, I got the one terabyte SSD.
[04:55.340 --> 05:00.740]  So I forget how much that cost, I think it was like $3,000, $3,500?
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.740]  Sounds about right.
[05:01.740 --> 05:02.980]  Some obscene amount of money.
[05:02.980 --> 05:08.540]  But my thinking is just max it out and I'll use it for at least four years, and then by
[05:08.540 --> 05:09.820]  the time I upgrade, it'll be nice.
[05:09.820 --> 05:14.820]  But anyway, the color stuff hurts a little bit because...
[05:14.820 --> 05:17.940]  So I think, correct me if I'm wrong, you probably know more about this than me.
[05:17.940 --> 05:27.380]  To me, the old consumer gold standard was the sRGB color space, and the basic gist if
[05:27.380 --> 05:31.780]  you just want to get a handle on this is that the new color space that all of these retina
[05:31.780 --> 05:40.260]  displays, both the 21 inch and the 27 inch, is significantly bigger than sRGB.
[05:40.260 --> 05:42.940]  It's much more of a pro color space.
[05:42.940 --> 05:47.060]  Very much so, and very similar to the kind of output that you're going to get on digital
[05:47.060 --> 05:48.060]  projectors.
[05:48.060 --> 05:53.980]  I'm looking up Rene's FAQ now so I can actually have specific terms.
[05:53.980 --> 06:00.820]  They're using DCI-P3, which is the same color space used by digital movie theaters, and
[06:00.820 --> 06:04.940]  they're using a different LED type display now.
[06:04.940 --> 06:11.380]  It's a more advanced red-green phosphor LED, which allows them to do better color balance
[06:11.380 --> 06:16.880]  and hit wider ranges of colors, which that combined with the new color space really makes
[06:16.880 --> 06:20.440]  for some crystal clear photos and video.
[06:20.440 --> 06:28.340]  Not that the 5K was hurting in that before, but I do feel that professional editors are
[06:28.340 --> 06:32.580]  going to hear that and just be like, damn it, why do I own a Mac Pro?
[06:32.580 --> 06:33.980]  Why do I own a 5K?
[06:33.980 --> 06:35.100]  Why don't I own this machine?
[06:35.100 --> 06:36.260]  Why can't I just replace it?
[06:36.260 --> 06:37.260]  Oh wait, I can.
[06:37.260 --> 06:39.620]  I just have to spend a ton of money.
[06:39.620 --> 06:40.980]  And I think it's funny.
[06:40.980 --> 06:46.940]  It's funny the way that even with the Macs, they're sort of, as they march towards this
[06:46.940 --> 06:53.740]  all retina lineup, I mean, and it's a year by year march where now it's by far the overwhelming
[06:53.740 --> 06:56.580]  majority of the products are all retina.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.580]  Finally, yeah.
[06:57.580 --> 07:04.220]  And it's funny the way it sort of follows the precedent that they've set with the iPads.
[07:04.220 --> 07:12.420]  To me, the 21-inch iMac is sort of like the iPad Mini compared to the iPad Air, which
[07:12.420 --> 07:14.140]  is the 27-inch iMac.
[07:14.140 --> 07:16.220]  So it gets everything a year ahead.
[07:16.220 --> 07:18.100]  It goes retina first.
[07:18.100 --> 07:23.740]  Now a year later, you can only get the 27-inch in retina.
[07:23.740 --> 07:29.100]  And the 21-inch does exactly what the 27-inch did last year, which is there's a high-end
[07:29.100 --> 07:33.480]  model with a retina display, but you can still get the non-retina.
[07:33.480 --> 07:37.100]  So my guess is by next year, there will be no more non-retina iMacs.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.100]  Yeah.
[07:38.100 --> 07:40.900]  There will only be even higher resolution retina iMacs.
[07:40.900 --> 07:41.900]  Yeah.
[07:41.900 --> 07:43.940]  I really like this.
[07:43.940 --> 07:47.300]  From a business standpoint, it seems like a good way to roll things out where they're
[07:47.300 --> 07:53.260]  like, oh, these displays are too expensive for your average user to want to pony up 3,000
[07:53.260 --> 07:54.380]  plus dollars.
[07:54.380 --> 07:57.260]  So we're going to put them in the high-end models for the people who are really going
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.180]  to appreciate them and be able to spend money on them.
[08:00.180 --> 08:03.220]  And then the more money they spend on them, the more orders that we can place with our
[08:03.220 --> 08:07.060]  suppliers, and the more orders we can place with our suppliers, we can bring the cost
[08:07.060 --> 08:12.460]  down and it just trickles down into the rest of the line.
[08:12.460 --> 08:13.460]  The what do you call it?
[08:13.460 --> 08:14.460]  The low-end model.
[08:14.460 --> 08:19.300]  I don't even know what it used to be, but it seems kind of wimpy.
[08:19.300 --> 08:25.940]  It's only 1.6, and I know none of us really talk about gigahertz anymore.
[08:25.940 --> 08:27.940]  It's gotten away from us.
[08:27.940 --> 08:35.220]  But when it's half the speed in gigahertz as the one that's only $400 more, it kind
[08:35.220 --> 08:36.220]  of sticks out.
[08:36.220 --> 08:38.220]  It's definitely an upsell.
[08:38.220 --> 08:43.460]  I have to assume that the low-end models are really designed for the education market or
[08:43.460 --> 08:48.620]  they're designed for the folks who, oh, well, you just need an iMac in your place of business,
[08:48.620 --> 08:54.820]  or you need an iMac that's essentially a glorified display to play a movie on.
[08:54.820 --> 08:59.060]  I don't know about education anymore, because I think that so much of education has gone
[08:59.060 --> 09:02.820]  to laptop form factors of some kind.
[09:02.820 --> 09:05.860]  A lot of Chromebooks, for sure.
[09:05.860 --> 09:06.860]  No question.
[09:06.860 --> 09:12.180]  But it doesn't seem to me like school, and there's a practical aspect of that too.
[09:12.180 --> 09:17.640]  If you're going to go with iMacs, you need to set them up in a permanent spot, whereas
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.980]  the whole gist of moving, especially in what I'm familiar with, with my son, with elementary
[09:23.980 --> 09:31.820]  school, it's that they can take the Chromebooks and the MacBooks out when they need them and
[09:31.820 --> 09:35.780]  set them up on the regular desks that they use for everything else.
[09:35.780 --> 09:38.060]  You don't need to go into a separate computer room.
[09:38.060 --> 09:43.020]  I'm more thinking administration-wise, where you're looking at nonprofits or people who
[09:43.020 --> 09:48.980]  really don't have a big budget for their electronics, which is sad a little bit in 2015.
[09:48.980 --> 09:53.220]  Or if you're just going to use it as the machine at the front desk for people to sign in when
[09:53.220 --> 09:57.060]  they come into the office or something, and you really don't need performance.
[09:57.060 --> 10:00.780]  If you haven't switched already to an iPad.
[10:00.780 --> 10:02.380]  What else are people complaining about?
[10:02.380 --> 10:10.020]  I know people are complaining that the hard drive is 5,400 RPM.
[10:10.020 --> 10:15.820]  I would rather complain that they're not SSDs in the iMac by default.
[10:15.820 --> 10:19.740]  But I guess if we want to complain about hard drive speed, we can complain about hard drive
[10:19.740 --> 10:20.740]  speed.
[10:20.740 --> 10:25.420]  But I think it has something to do with the 21.5 inches, a 2.5 inch hard drive as opposed
[10:25.420 --> 10:27.100]  to a 3.5 inch hard drive.
[10:27.100 --> 10:30.580]  So a little bit trickier there.
[10:30.580 --> 10:36.220]  In a weird way, even though it's 21 inches, it's sort of like, in some ways, I think the
[10:36.220 --> 10:39.660]  guts of a laptop.
[10:39.660 --> 10:44.960]  When you think about how thin the 21.5 inch iMac is, and just how much space of that has
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.960]  to be filled with, oh, you know, giant retina display and cooling said giant retina display,
[10:51.960 --> 10:59.100]  you really don't have all that much more area to put in high level chips without necessarily
[10:59.100 --> 11:02.920]  unless unless they figure out a way to flatten silicon even more like, oh, yes, we're going
[11:02.920 --> 11:10.540]  to line the edges of the iMac display with silicon chips now.
[11:10.540 --> 11:16.080]  I did notice too on the 21 inch, the storage for flash only goes up to 512.
[11:16.080 --> 11:19.720]  So if you want a terabyte you're looking at, but I guess that kind of makes sense.
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.940]  I feel like because a terabyte of flash storage is still very expensive relative to hard drive
[11:25.940 --> 11:28.340]  prices for sure.
[11:28.340 --> 11:32.500]  And I guess once you're in that sort of budget range, you're looking at the 27 inch anyway.
[11:32.500 --> 11:39.420]  Yeah, when I was pricing out my 21.5 and for me, I prefer slightly the 21.5 space for my
[11:39.420 --> 11:44.820]  desk because I, I don't know the 27 inch like is gorgeous, but I feel myself getting lost
[11:44.820 --> 11:49.080]  in that space, especially in retina, or it's just it's too much too much for me unless
[11:49.080 --> 11:54.340]  I'm editing video in which case, oh, this is nice pixel for pixel 4k is great.
[11:54.340 --> 12:00.840]  But when I was pricing out my 21.5 inch iMac, I was looking at the price I was like, alright,
[12:00.840 --> 12:06.020]  so I'm upgrading to a fusion drive and I'm upgrading the memory and you know, I'm putting
[12:06.020 --> 12:09.340]  on a magic trackpad because so magic mice.
[12:09.340 --> 12:13.900]  And then I'm looking at the price I'm like, this is basically the price of a mid level
[12:13.900 --> 12:18.780]  to high level 27 inch stock iMac.
[12:18.780 --> 12:22.220]  And I yeah, I think you're absolutely right where people look at that price and they're
[12:22.220 --> 12:27.380]  like, well, but I could go bigger and bigger would make you know, bigger is always better,
[12:27.380 --> 12:28.380]  right?
[12:28.380 --> 12:30.820]  And for the most part, I you know, again, they're
[12:30.820 --> 12:34.720]  there are certain circumstances where I actually think a 21.5 is better than a 27.
[12:34.720 --> 12:37.740]  But I think for the vast majority of users, they're like, Oh, I can get a bigger screen
[12:37.740 --> 12:42.860]  for the same amount of tweaking as you know, I would pay for trying to upgrade the internals
[12:42.860 --> 12:44.740]  of a 21.5.
[12:44.740 --> 12:45.740]  Sign me up.
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.740]  Yeah.
[12:46.740 --> 12:51.860]  Is all of the RAM Do you know this is the RAM soldered onto the motherboard like it
[12:51.860 --> 12:53.600]  is in the 21.5.
[12:53.600 --> 12:59.260]  It is not in the 21.7 which I heard 21.7 the 20 the 27 inch Yeah.
[12:59.260 --> 13:04.900]  So it's just another way where there is sort of a consumer slash pro split between 21 and
[13:04.900 --> 13:05.900]  27.
[13:05.900 --> 13:06.900]  Mm hmm.
[13:06.900 --> 13:11.820]  It's very I think the 21 is still very much marketed towards the entry, not even the entry
[13:11.820 --> 13:16.460]  level user, but the user who either has their first Mac or is about to get their first Mac
[13:16.460 --> 13:22.140]  and needs a desktop over a laptop or an iPad, right?
[13:22.140 --> 13:28.380]  I kind of feel I understand, you know, the there's a couple people on Twitter and who
[13:28.380 --> 13:32.020]  have emailed me about the soldering of the RAM and it seems like that's a real sticking
[13:32.020 --> 13:35.700]  point for a certain segment of the audience.
[13:35.700 --> 13:39.540]  But I really feel like it's almost like we're lucky that you can do it on any of the machines
[13:39.540 --> 13:40.540]  anymore.
[13:40.540 --> 13:43.260]  Like, yeah, just not the way of the future.
[13:43.260 --> 13:51.620]  Like your computers from Apple come out of China completely set for the most part.
[13:51.620 --> 13:55.500]  So my, you know, I, you know, take it, you know, so that the fact that you can still
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.620]  add you diddle with the RAM on your own on the 27 inch, take that as a win.
[13:59.620 --> 14:05.540]  And I wouldn't lose much sleep over the 21.5 being, you know, you choose eight or 16 and
[14:05.540 --> 14:06.540]  live with it forever.
[14:06.540 --> 14:07.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:07.540 --> 14:13.020]  I would, I would much prefer to be able to remove and twiddle with RAM.
[14:13.020 --> 14:15.740]  And there's an there's a model to do that.
[14:15.740 --> 14:18.820]  But for the again, the average user, I just don't think cares.
[14:18.820 --> 14:24.860]  No, and I feel like it's another it's another way that the iOS devices again, I you know,
[14:24.860 --> 14:28.740]  people, people keep asking, and Apple keeps saying, No, we're not going to have one operating
[14:28.740 --> 14:29.740]  system for everything.
[14:29.740 --> 14:32.600]  And I really think that they're serious about it.
[14:32.600 --> 14:40.900]  But they are, you can see where, you know, one platform is going by where the other platform
[14:40.900 --> 14:48.940]  has gone first, and the iOS hardware model of there's nothing that you can alter or adjust,
[14:48.940 --> 14:55.460]  there's no way to put a memory card in to expand the storage or anything like that is
[14:55.460 --> 14:57.860]  definitely the way the Mac is heading.
[14:57.860 --> 15:02.820]  Yeah, I and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing anymore.
[15:02.820 --> 15:03.860]  I know.
[15:03.860 --> 15:07.220]  There's a lot of people have been arms or it's Oh, it's less repairable and Oh, what
[15:07.220 --> 15:09.140]  if I want to tinker with my computer?
[15:09.140 --> 15:11.860]  Oh, there's still ways to build your own computer.
[15:11.860 --> 15:15.540]  It's just not going to be from Apple.
[15:15.540 --> 15:19.700]  I don't see that there's something wrong with Apple saying, You know what, we know what
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.020]  the best processors in the market are going to be, we know what the the best memory is
[15:23.020 --> 15:24.020]  going to be.
[15:24.020 --> 15:27.680]  And we're going to package it up in a, you know, in a package that actually makes sense
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.860]  for you as a user that would give you real world usage.
[15:30.860 --> 15:34.300]  I mean, we've never been able to tinker with an iPhone's internals.
[15:34.300 --> 15:37.220]  I don't think anybody's complaining about that, because most people wouldn't know how
[15:37.220 --> 15:40.540]  to even begin to solder micro architecture.
[15:40.540 --> 15:44.640]  It's only because the IMAX architecture is big enough that we at one point, we're able
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.980]  to feasibly play around with it that we're like, Yeah, we can totally build a better
[15:47.980 --> 15:50.040]  computer than Apple, no problem.
[15:50.040 --> 15:51.040]  Apple's totally wrong.
[15:51.040 --> 15:53.580]  You don't need a gigabytes, you need more than eight gigabytes of RAM.
[15:53.580 --> 15:58.460]  And that I kind of agree with the general population on but, but still, I don't think
[15:58.460 --> 16:02.540]  that it's necessarily a bad thing.
[16:02.540 --> 16:06.700]  And then lastly, you touched on this a few minutes ago, but it's at this point, and I
[16:06.700 --> 16:08.100]  don't think the Mac Pro is dead.
[16:08.100 --> 16:13.400]  I think that there will be a new one at some point, but who knows when and you don't have
[16:13.400 --> 16:20.860]  to just look at the new Darth Vader Mac Pro, you could just look back at maybe even going
[16:20.860 --> 16:26.260]  back close to 10 years now that the Mac Pro just does not see updates anywhere near on
[16:26.260 --> 16:27.620]  a yearly schedule.
[16:27.620 --> 16:29.100]  No, it will.
[16:29.100 --> 16:34.740]  It does make sense also, to be perfectly honest, because the Mac Pro has such different internals
[16:34.740 --> 16:39.540]  than the other than the other two lines, and because their internals are very, at least
[16:39.540 --> 16:44.740]  at this point, very hog tied to Intel's rollout schedule, like it doesn't make sense for the
[16:44.740 --> 16:48.940]  for the Mac Pro to be updated until they can have a processor that has full Thunderbolt
[16:48.940 --> 16:49.940]  3 functionality.
[16:49.940 --> 16:55.120]  So they could, you know, say, release a retina display with with Thunderbolt 3 so that people
[16:55.120 --> 16:59.340]  could have their their 4k display without an iMac.
[16:59.340 --> 17:03.100]  But it doesn't like I don't know, it seems it seems silly to me to push like incremental
[17:03.100 --> 17:08.180]  updates to the MacBook Pro, or the Mac, the Mac Pro, because the only the only people
[17:08.180 --> 17:13.020]  who are buying it are, at this point are serious pros, because the my Mac has filled that kind
[17:13.020 --> 17:14.600]  of semi pro hole.
[17:14.600 --> 17:18.600]  So if you're buying a serious pro machine, you're only going to upgrade your serious
[17:18.600 --> 17:22.980]  pro machine, like we were talking about earlier when your old pro machine is about ready to
[17:22.980 --> 17:28.300]  die, or it does something so spectacularly different that it's going to be better for
[17:28.300 --> 17:29.300]  you.
[17:29.300 --> 17:35.420]  Yeah, but for some people, I think it's clearly you know, the the big iMac, the 27 inch iMac
[17:35.420 --> 17:38.460]  is the the proper pro machine for them.
[17:38.460 --> 17:43.780]  Like I'm thinking like, especially like photographers and video editors, oh, yeah, because of the
[17:43.780 --> 17:48.920]  extra color space, because there is no retina display from Apple, you know, the only way
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.180]  to get it anything like a retina display is sort of a hack at this point.
[17:54.180 --> 18:00.860]  With the Mac Pro, it's, I think it's clearly the better machine, but then I wonder if they
[18:00.860 --> 18:05.740]  buy them now, are they going to be mad if, you know, Mac Pros are announced at WWDC or
[18:05.740 --> 18:06.740]  something like that?
[18:06.740 --> 18:10.740]  Yeah, where it's like, oh, now we have a Thunderbolt three retina display.
[18:10.740 --> 18:15.560]  I mean, when you're talking about that kind of a space, it depends on what project you're
[18:15.560 --> 18:17.100]  working on right now, right?
[18:17.100 --> 18:22.660]  If they need retina support, if they're working on 4k video, and actively, you know, doing
[18:22.660 --> 18:26.460]  that for their job, they're going to want a good 4k monitor.
[18:26.460 --> 18:29.020]  And the real question is, well, can I get that from a third party?
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.440]  And is it still gonna look great?
[18:30.440 --> 18:37.780]  Or do I want to go to, you know, a machine that has DCI color space and use that instead?
[18:37.780 --> 18:39.540]  And I think that might be the selling fact.
[18:39.540 --> 18:43.460]  Will they will they be then grumpy if Apple's like, yes, now we have a pro that supports
[18:43.460 --> 18:45.020]  a retina display there.
[18:45.020 --> 18:50.340]  But if they needed that functionality six months ago, then that that announcement six
[18:50.340 --> 18:53.540]  months later isn't going to help them like it isn't going to help them finish this project
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.540]  today.
[18:54.540 --> 19:01.900]  So maybe, and you know, maybe this is wishful thinking, but maybe once I feel like the,
[19:01.900 --> 19:07.800]  in a lot of ways, all of these machines, the move to retina has been difficult for every
[19:07.800 --> 19:12.160]  single thing, because it's always a lot because you're effectively going to four times the
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.280]  pixels, you know, at least at some point, you're going to say, here's a new, here's
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.660]  a new machine that replaces one from last year, and it has four times the pictures.
[19:20.660 --> 19:21.660]  Right?
[19:21.660 --> 19:26.940]  I mean, and so like, it was a huge deal when the iPhone four when retina in 2010, and the
[19:26.940 --> 19:30.460]  iMac or the iPad took a while to follow.
[19:30.460 --> 19:31.460]  Max took a long time to follow.
[19:31.460 --> 19:37.220]  And it was only on one model, the 15 inch MacBook Pro at first.
[19:37.220 --> 19:43.220]  And I feel like the Mac Pro is the last and it's the hardest because they can't just seal
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.220]  it all up.
[19:44.220 --> 19:48.620]  Like with the, you know, remember the crazy story about how they got the 5k iMac last
[19:48.620 --> 19:54.140]  year was with this weird internal, you know, how are they driving all those pixels when
[19:54.140 --> 19:56.180]  it seems like there isn't a graphics card to do it?
[19:56.180 --> 20:00.700]  And they had to write their own, you know, their own video controller, right, they had
[20:00.700 --> 20:03.220]  to invent hardware to do it.
[20:03.220 --> 20:07.260]  With a Mac Pro, they really are stuck waiting on Thunderbolt three, because it has to be
[20:07.260 --> 20:08.260]  a cable.
[20:08.260 --> 20:13.940]  Yeah, they can't, they can't write their own graphics controller in a machine that they're
[20:13.940 --> 20:17.660]  not, you know, they just don't have the they don't have the flexibility right now without
[20:17.660 --> 20:21.820]  having a display that they connect via three, Thunderbolt three or something along those
[20:21.820 --> 20:22.820]  lines.
[20:22.820 --> 20:26.260]  So maybe once they make this is where I'm going to maybe once they make that leap, and
[20:26.260 --> 20:32.140]  maybe, you know, I can't help but think it's a 2016 thing that at some point in 2016, whether
[20:32.140 --> 20:37.740]  it's early in the year, or WWDC or next October at the latest, that they'll have a Mac Pro
[20:37.740 --> 20:43.100]  update and a, you know, whatever they're going to call it, cinema display, Thunderbolt three
[20:43.100 --> 20:49.300]  display, whatever, but a standalone retina display, comparable, or even better than the
[20:49.300 --> 20:56.260]  5k iMac display for Mac pros, but that maybe once they make that leap, maybe then the Mac
[20:56.260 --> 21:01.460]  Pro can see a slightly more regular incremental updates, because they've already made that
[21:01.460 --> 21:08.100]  jump and they can just sort of keep, he can maintain, right, keep dipping in with the
[21:08.100 --> 21:11.060]  latest and greatest incremental updates from Intel.
[21:11.060 --> 21:16.920]  Yeah, I mean, until until they decide to make another logical leap, which Intel is unable
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.460]  to take, it's it feels like that we're talking about power PCs, and we're suddenly in the
[21:21.460 --> 21:23.460]  early 2000s.
[21:23.460 --> 21:27.240]  It's so weird to me that all of a sudden, you know, Intel, which we used to hold up
[21:27.240 --> 21:33.260]  this kind of the gold standard of like, regular TikTok updates is now very much a little hamstrung,
[21:33.260 --> 21:39.340]  where I what the MacBook Pros were waiting on Broadwell chips for a very long time.
[21:39.340 --> 21:44.620]  The new iMacs were waiting on Skylake and eventually shipped half and half like that
[21:44.620 --> 21:46.500]  kind of stuff is so crazy.
[21:46.500 --> 21:51.660]  The Mac Bros are probably waiting on Skylake and Thunderbolt three to build proper cinema
[21:51.660 --> 21:52.780]  displays.
[21:52.780 --> 21:57.700]  I wonder also how long Apple is going to continue being like, well, we have to wait around for
[21:57.700 --> 22:02.240]  our manufacturing partners, because they've really they've cut most of that out on the
[22:02.240 --> 22:03.500]  on the iOS line.
[22:03.500 --> 22:06.300]  You know, they're not waiting around for a lot of people because they're building their
[22:06.300 --> 22:07.300]  own chips.
[22:07.300 --> 22:08.300]  Yeah.
[22:08.300 --> 22:09.300]  Well, I don't know.
[22:09.300 --> 22:13.020]  I don't think they can do that on the high end pro side within, you know, with Intel.
[22:13.020 --> 22:15.300]  Yeah, not certainly not right now.
[22:15.300 --> 22:16.300]  Right.
[22:16.300 --> 22:20.220]  And even in the foreseeable future, if you know, and this is a rabbit hole, we don't
[22:20.220 --> 22:21.220]  have to go down.
[22:21.220 --> 22:26.500]  But the whole idea of ARM based max, clearly in the same way that retina came in at the,
[22:26.500 --> 22:31.220]  you know, step by step, ARM based max, if it ever happens, are going to come in not
[22:31.220 --> 22:36.380]  all at once, but step by step, and it's going to start with the, you know, one port MacBook.
[22:36.380 --> 22:38.500]  Oh, yeah, it'll start at the very low end.
[22:38.500 --> 22:43.660]  I don't even Yeah, I can't I can't imagine and are an ARM based Mac Pro is definitely
[22:43.660 --> 22:44.660]  a ways away.
[22:44.660 --> 22:45.660]  Yeah.
[22:45.660 --> 22:46.660]  It's possible.
[22:46.660 --> 22:51.580]  But it's, you know, that's that's like outside the event horizon that Yes.
[22:51.580 --> 22:54.420]  I guess the thing that leaves people with a bad taste in their mouth, though, is that
[22:54.420 --> 23:00.260]  if you if you are a premium customer at Apple, and you have money to burn, it's easy to feel
[23:00.260 --> 23:05.420]  confident that you've got the best thing like you can just go in and you know, if you're
[23:05.420 --> 23:13.060]  going to buy an, an iPhone, if you're willing to, if you like the bigger size, or just willing
[23:13.060 --> 23:17.540]  to put up with the bigger size, if you get the success plus, and you max the storage,
[23:17.540 --> 23:21.480]  you know, you're getting the best of everything, you've got the the image stabilization on
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.220]  the camera, and all the best performance.
[23:25.220 --> 23:29.060]  And if you don't like the bigger size, you know exactly what you're missing out.
[23:29.060 --> 23:31.640]  All you're missing out on is the image stabilization.
[23:31.640 --> 23:35.280]  And you've got the best iPhone, iPad, it's really easy.
[23:35.280 --> 23:40.320]  To get the best iPad, everybody knows that the new iPad Pro is going to be the most powerful
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.320]  iPad.
[23:41.320 --> 23:42.320]  Yes.
[23:42.320 --> 23:48.620]  And it's the only one that has the the new, you know, pen based screen, pencil based screen,
[23:48.620 --> 23:50.620]  I keep calling it a pen.
[23:50.620 --> 23:51.620]  Yeah.
[23:51.620 --> 23:55.620]  So you know, and you know what the trade off is, it's the physical size of the device.
[23:55.620 --> 23:58.220]  And I think what leaves people with a bad taste in their mouths when they've dropped
[23:58.220 --> 24:02.580]  a lot of money on a Mac Pro rig is that they look around and they're like, I don't have
[24:02.580 --> 24:03.580]  the best of anything.
[24:03.580 --> 24:09.300]  Yeah, I'm kind of in this, I mean, I'm in this purgatory, this pro this pro purgatory
[24:09.300 --> 24:10.300]  hell.
[24:10.300 --> 24:15.140]  Yeah, I mean, I've talked to a lot of I have a lot of friends in the film industry and
[24:15.140 --> 24:20.100]  a lot of people have been slowly but surely switching away from Mac Pros.
[24:20.100 --> 24:24.060]  And I guess Mac Pros make sense to a certain extent, I guess if you want to rig up, you
[24:24.060 --> 24:25.060]  know, a massive,
[24:25.060 --> 24:27.260]  yeah, and I shouldn't say that they don't have the best of everything.
[24:27.260 --> 24:35.100]  They do have the best expansion and they do have like, for certain computationally intensive
[24:35.100 --> 24:40.780]  tasks that the having eight cores or however many cores you can max the thing out 1662.
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.860]  Yeah, right.
[24:41.860 --> 24:45.900]  You can really you know, you can do there's certain tasks that if you can split them up
[24:45.900 --> 24:49.020]  in parallel like that, really, you can see tremendous advantages.
[24:49.020 --> 24:52.860]  So there are some but it's a mixed bag where you're trading off like, you don't have a
[24:52.860 --> 24:59.140]  display anywhere near as nice as the retina five K Mac and the fight, you know, like a,
[24:59.140 --> 25:04.020]  you know, for $2,000, you could buy an iMac with a better display than than the, you know,
[25:04.020 --> 25:06.420]  a $20,000 Mac Pro setup could have.
[25:06.420 --> 25:13.460]  Yeah, I mean, the 12 core Mac Pro is very impressive in as you were saying in some respects,
[25:13.460 --> 25:19.940]  but it's interesting to me as somebody who used to live almost obsessively off of off
[25:19.940 --> 25:26.580]  of towers, and then later with the Mac Pro, the original sort of pre pre cylindrical,
[25:26.580 --> 25:32.020]  pro machine, how much I don't fit into that mindset anymore, even, you know, I don't do
[25:32.020 --> 25:36.680]  nearly as much film editing, like editing as I used to, but still, like the iMac really
[25:36.680 --> 25:43.860]  has become I think, the desktop machine for 80 85% of the population, including the pros.
[25:43.860 --> 25:44.860]  Yeah.
[25:44.860 --> 25:46.180]  Or it just it makes more sense.
[25:46.180 --> 25:49.860]  You don't need well, you don't need the I mean, you think about where the iMac debuted
[25:49.860 --> 25:50.860]  right.
[25:50.860 --> 25:55.200]  And Apple had this great, this great then and now website that they put up alongside
[25:55.200 --> 25:56.200]  the new iMac.
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.520]  So they're like, let's remember back to 1997 and the original iMac and how much faster
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.200]  our new iMacs are versus that.
[26:04.200 --> 26:08.940]  The iMac when it came out was very hamstrung and very much a consumer friendly.
[26:08.940 --> 26:13.080]  This is the intro to this is your introduction to the Mac line device.
[26:13.080 --> 26:17.840]  And as it's grown throughout the years, it really has, you know, it's been able to beef
[26:17.840 --> 26:23.120]  up what it can do and how it can compete against the Mac Pro when I mean, retina is only the
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.820]  latest in a series of dynamic and smart improvements that move it on up, you're still you're not
[26:28.820 --> 26:31.600]  going to get the most cores and you're not going to get the most RAM and you're not going
[26:31.600 --> 26:38.620]  to be able to slot things in and out because the screen is what like an inch thick, but
[26:38.620 --> 26:42.520]  but it's it's the better computer for the majority of people and I mean, that's that's
[26:42.520 --> 26:43.920]  Apple's goal, right?
[26:43.920 --> 26:46.600]  They don't want you to have to fiddle around with things.
[26:46.600 --> 26:47.600]  Yeah.
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.680]  I remember that site the other day that the then and now comparison to the 98 iMac and
[26:52.680 --> 26:58.900]  it is it's a cool comparison to you know, wow, how quickly we've you know, I say quickly,
[26:58.900 --> 27:02.600]  but it's been 17 years, but it's feels quick.
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.640]  But it is interesting to compare it in this in the context of this discussion of what
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.000]  do you get if you're a pro and you want to drop as you know, get the best rig you can
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.960]  in 1998 anybody with a Mac Pro or is that what we call Mac Pros back they were G four
[27:18.960 --> 27:25.880]  G three towers, Power Macs, Power Mac G threes, Power Mac G three would look at the iMac and
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.200]  say, wow, that's cute.
[27:27.200 --> 27:31.760]  But there wasn't one single thing about it that was better than you know, performance
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.880]  wise or decides that display wise that you could drive you know, you have fun with your
[27:35.880 --> 27:38.480]  little hockey puck mouse and all in one computer.
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.400]  No, you used to get the hockey puck with the Power Mac too.
[27:41.400 --> 27:42.760]  It was Yeah, that's right.
[27:42.760 --> 27:43.760]  That's right.
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.120]  But yeah, but ever anybody I knew with a with a Power Mac upgraded to a Kensington is like,
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.120]  Oh, yes, ball.
[27:49.120 --> 27:50.120]  mice are superior.
[27:50.120 --> 27:54.360]  Do you know I've brought this up many times before over the years, but my wife, Amy, she
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.280]  loved the hockey puck mouse.
[27:56.280 --> 27:59.080]  It is not universally loathed.
[27:59.080 --> 28:01.060]  There were people and my wife was one of them.
[28:01.060 --> 28:05.080]  She used it for years afterwards, like on subsequent, you know, she kept she kept her
[28:05.080 --> 28:08.240]  iMac mouse and moved it from computer to computer.
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.040]  Oh, I still have my my hockey puck mouse.
[28:11.040 --> 28:12.200]  I did like it.
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.520]  I didn't like it for certain tasks.
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.240]  But it's cute in its own way.
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.880]  It's it's it's part of the joy of the iMac.
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.360]  I don't know, the haters, the haters can go hate somewhere else.
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.360]  Yeah, well, hold that thought.
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.360]  I'm going to do a sponsor read, but we'll go back and we'll talk about the new mouse.
[28:28.360 --> 28:30.120]  It's a good segue.
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.400]  But first, let me tell everybody about our good friends at Harry's.
[28:34.400 --> 28:40.360]  You guys know Harry's they offer high quality razors and blades for a fraction of the price
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.840]  of the big name brand razor brands.
[28:44.840 --> 28:49.640]  Harry's was started by two guys who just wanted a better product without paying an arm and
[28:49.640 --> 28:52.780]  a leg because shaving stuff, razor blades are super expensive.
[28:52.780 --> 28:54.080]  There's no reason for it.
[28:54.080 --> 28:56.960]  So Harry's is super serious about this.
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.160]  They're not just like some kind of thing where they buy white label razor blades and put
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.720]  their own logo on them or whatever.
[29:01.720 --> 29:07.780]  They actually were sourcing them from an old, really old razor factory in Germany.
[29:07.780 --> 29:11.380]  And they like the product so much that they bought the factory.
[29:11.380 --> 29:17.520]  So these are high quality, high performing German made razor blades that Harry's supervises
[29:17.520 --> 29:18.520]  themselves.
[29:18.520 --> 29:23.480]  The reason they can sell stuff for so much less is that it's it's like the whole Internet
[29:23.480 --> 29:24.480]  model.
[29:24.480 --> 29:25.480]  It's just direct.
[29:25.480 --> 29:28.840]  You go to Harry's website, you sign up and they ship it to you.
[29:28.840 --> 29:30.040]  So there's no middlemen.
[29:30.040 --> 29:31.560]  There are no distributors.
[29:31.560 --> 29:32.560]  There's no retail.
[29:32.560 --> 29:37.800]  Like every step of the way when you buy razor blades like at a Walgreens or even at like
[29:37.800 --> 29:42.800]  Amazon or something like that, it's a little bit of markup each step of the way it goes
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.040]  to a distributor, goes to the retailer and everybody takes a little cut.
[29:46.040 --> 29:50.400]  Harry's just sells these things direct right from them, right to you.
[29:50.400 --> 29:51.400]  And the prices are amazing.
[29:51.400 --> 29:58.480]  They have a starter set, 15 bucks, get you a razor, your choice of moisturizing shave
[29:58.480 --> 30:02.240]  cream or gel and three razor blades.
[30:02.240 --> 30:05.640]  And when you need more blades, they are two bucks each or less.
[30:05.640 --> 30:09.260]  You can get an eight pack for just 15 bucks, but if you want to buy in bulk, they get cheaper
[30:09.260 --> 30:10.260]  and cheaper.
[30:10.260 --> 30:13.800]  Sixteen pack is 25 bucks.
[30:13.800 --> 30:19.260]  If you go to Amazon, Gillette fusions, 12 pack of blades is 41 bucks.
[30:19.260 --> 30:22.600]  So it's like half the price of a Gillette fusion.
[30:22.600 --> 30:23.600]  Totally serious.
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.600]  I use it myself.
[30:24.600 --> 30:27.440]  Very, very comparable quality wise.
[30:27.440 --> 30:28.440]  I've had mine.
[30:28.440 --> 30:29.440]  I don't know.
[30:29.440 --> 30:32.520]  The listeners of the show know that Harry's has been sponsoring the show for at least
[30:32.520 --> 30:34.960]  two years, maybe even longer.
[30:34.960 --> 30:36.500]  And they sent me one way back when they started.
[30:36.500 --> 30:40.500]  I still have that razor handle and I look at it now.
[30:40.500 --> 30:41.500]  It looks brand new.
[30:41.500 --> 30:42.500]  It looks mint condition.
[30:42.500 --> 30:45.700]  It looks like I could just package it up and sell it as mint.
[30:45.700 --> 30:46.760]  Really high quality stuff.
[30:46.760 --> 30:54.800]  So go check them out at harrys.com and the code, the promo code is the talk show.
[30:54.800 --> 30:58.920]  And if you are a first time customer, you will save five bucks off your first purchase,
[30:58.920 --> 31:03.220]  which means you can get that starter kit for just 10 bucks, which is amazing.
[31:03.220 --> 31:08.180]  So go to harrys.com and the code is the talk show.
[31:08.180 --> 31:15.200]  So the other new stuff that Apple, uh, announced this week with these IMAX are all new, uh,
[31:15.200 --> 31:24.000]  wireless peripherals, new keyboard, accessories, new keyboard, a new magic trackpad and a new
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  magic mouse.
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.800]  I just can't call it the magic mouse.
[31:26.800 --> 31:31.560]  It just makes me crash crack up every time I think of like the little cartoon characters.
[31:31.560 --> 31:38.400]  I, I, you know, it's funny because I feel like we get used to Apple's names and I remember
[31:38.400 --> 31:43.160]  like a Mac book was Mac book was so hard.
[31:43.160 --> 31:46.440]  It just seemed, I don't know, it just was really hard for me to get it.
[31:46.440 --> 31:51.760]  And now, you know, it's, it just, just your brain gets bludgeoned into accepting it over
[31:51.760 --> 31:52.760]  time.
[31:52.760 --> 31:53.760]  It's second nature.
[31:53.760 --> 31:54.760]  You're like, all right, I've given up.
[31:54.760 --> 31:56.960]  I, I won't, I won't call it a power book anymore.
[31:56.960 --> 31:57.960]  Sorry, Apple.
[31:57.960 --> 32:03.160]  And I understand the logic of it because the power and power book was from power PC and
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.360]  it wasn't really branded by Apple.
[32:05.360 --> 32:08.080]  Whereas putting Mac in the name really does help it.
[32:08.080 --> 32:12.880]  It actually makes some kind of sense that all of the Macs would have, uh, the word Mac
[32:12.880 --> 32:13.880]  in them.
[32:13.880 --> 32:14.880]  Yeah.
[32:14.880 --> 32:15.880]  Right.
[32:15.880 --> 32:16.880]  I understand that.
[32:16.880 --> 32:17.960]  But Mac book was somehow a mouthful.
[32:17.960 --> 32:23.880]  It just doesn't seem like two words that fit quite as well together as power book did.
[32:23.880 --> 32:30.320]  Um, but to me, the colonies things, magic as always, it embarrasses me every time I
[32:30.320 --> 32:32.560]  have to type in or say it.
[32:32.560 --> 32:34.320]  Yeah, it's, it feels right.
[32:34.320 --> 32:35.320]  Oh yes.
[32:35.320 --> 32:37.240]  These, these are different than normal accessories.
[32:37.240 --> 32:38.380]  How you ask?
[32:38.380 --> 32:41.160]  They have magic.
[32:41.160 --> 32:42.160]  The magic trackpad.
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.160]  Yeah.
[32:43.160 --> 32:44.160]  It still makes me smile.
[32:44.160 --> 32:48.440]  The trackpad, I can kind of understand it because yes, it does, especially with the
[32:48.440 --> 32:54.360]  new improvements to this version of the trackpad where it gets the, the Mac books, uh, taptic
[32:54.360 --> 32:56.040]  engine and fo clicking.
[32:56.040 --> 32:58.040]  So you're no longer depressing a button.
[32:58.040 --> 33:02.000]  You just, you're using, you're using the magic of force touch and the, the tactic engine
[33:02.000 --> 33:04.680]  to, to make it feel like you're clicking like that.
[33:04.680 --> 33:09.560]  I would actually genuinely use, it feels like magic because you're not actually clicking
[33:09.560 --> 33:14.320]  on anything, but the mouse is still just a mouse.
[33:14.320 --> 33:15.320]  Yeah.
[33:15.320 --> 33:18.920]  And I guess that their claim for the magic is that you get both the mouse that moves
[33:18.920 --> 33:25.600]  and you get the, the, you know, you can do the gestures on the surface, but to me, it's
[33:25.600 --> 33:31.080]  like that, it's just, that's just the way you, you Apple have chosen to implement the
[33:31.080 --> 33:36.520]  scroll wheels and you know, mice have done more than just move the cursor around for
[33:36.520 --> 33:38.380]  a very long time.
[33:38.380 --> 33:43.240]  And it's just an implementation detail, whether you're going to use a wheel or that memory
[33:43.240 --> 33:48.680]  member, that little, that little ball they had for awhile.
[33:48.680 --> 33:55.760]  So truth be told, I have not used an Apple manufactured mouse on a regular basis since
[33:55.760 --> 34:02.360]  the ADB era, the last ADB Apple mouse, which was a one button mouse.
[34:02.360 --> 34:03.360]  I loved it.
[34:03.360 --> 34:07.920]  Um, it had a great click and it had a great form factor.
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.720]  Uh, it fit my hand the way that I like to hold a mouse.
[34:11.720 --> 34:16.440]  I know ATP has gone long on this a while ago that depending on it, when you learn to use
[34:16.440 --> 34:20.920]  a mouse, you grip it in a certain way, whether you rest your hand on it or something.
[34:20.920 --> 34:29.440]  And the, I need like a big, uh, I don't know, like a much bigger mouse than the magic mouse
[34:29.440 --> 34:30.440]  to be comfortable.
[34:30.440 --> 34:31.440]  You need to fit your hand.
[34:31.440 --> 34:32.440]  Yeah.
[34:32.440 --> 34:36.440]  You need it to have a good arc because it's the, it's the exact opposite problem of RSA
[34:36.440 --> 34:41.040]  on a keyboard where you don't necessarily want your wrist arced up with a mouse.
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.240]  I feel like you need, you need the comfortable arc to rest your hand on it.
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.120]  If you're going to be resting your hand on a mouse for a while and going around and clicking,
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.120]  it needs to feel good.
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.800]  And it needs to not feel like your hand is dwarfing the mouse so that you can't actually
[34:53.800 --> 34:55.760]  find the buttons by touch.
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.160]  So I will confess the mouse that I use, I, I don't know if I can get a picture of this.
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.720]  I guess I'll try to maybe put it in the show notes.
[35:02.720 --> 35:11.420]  The mouse that I use is at least it absolutely positively, I bought it in the nineties.
[35:11.420 --> 35:13.360]  It's from Logitech.
[35:13.360 --> 35:19.160]  And even in the nineties when I bought it, I don't think I paid more than $14 for it.
[35:19.160 --> 35:21.880]  And it's so old it, I swear to God, I'm not making this up.
[35:21.880 --> 35:22.880]  It doesn't even have a laser.
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.800]  It has a ball and it is super, super precise.
[35:28.800 --> 35:37.000]  I actually, because of RSI issues, I use a third-party mouse driver to what's it called?
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.280]  I had to switch at one point.
[35:38.280 --> 35:44.360]  It's called steer mouse, S T E E R M O U S E. It's from some guy in Japan that lets you
[35:44.360 --> 35:51.360]  set your mouse speed significantly faster than the system mount, you know, the very
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.200]  fastest speed of the system mouse.
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.440]  So I could go, even on my 5k iMac, I can go corner to corner pretty much without even
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.960]  using my wrist, just my fingers.
[36:01.960 --> 36:05.760]  And the ball on this thing is it's so super precise.
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.600]  Like it's like, so giant 27 inch screen, I have the speed ramped up so far.
[36:10.600 --> 36:12.400]  Like my son cannot even use it.
[36:12.400 --> 36:18.760]  He thinks it's crazy because he just immediately Rams from corner to corner by moving it because
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.180]  it's so, you know, the differences is so subtle and this mouse, it just has never broken the
[36:24.180 --> 36:25.180]  buttons still work.
[36:25.180 --> 36:26.920]  I mean, at some point, I guess it's going to break.
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.080]  I mean, every button fails eventually, but it's ancient, but I haven't used an Apple
[36:31.080 --> 36:32.920]  mouse since, since the nineties.
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.680]  What is it connected via USB to USB?
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.760]  So at least I was going to ask if you were connecting via SCSI, you know, to some like
[36:39.760 --> 36:43.720]  crazy, but I do, I do still have my ADB keyboard.
[36:43.720 --> 36:44.720]  Oh my God.
[36:44.720 --> 36:45.720]  Yeah.
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.080]  You know, I was talking to my dad the other day, uh, right after the new accessories came
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.720]  out and he's like rolling his eyes.
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.520]  He's like, no, nothing can, nothing can be better than my, my Kensington track ball.
[36:57.520 --> 37:02.640]  And he still, and this, that thing is probably from 1999 too, because I remember using it
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.240]  playing like star Wars, episode one pod racer or something crazy like that.
[37:07.240 --> 37:12.600]  Um, so it's definitely, I feel like people have very specific preferences with their
[37:12.600 --> 37:13.600]  mice.
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.880]  I think what I have to do is I got to get on eBay and start hunting around for like
[37:17.880 --> 37:18.880]  for another copy.
[37:18.880 --> 37:19.880]  Yeah.
[37:19.880 --> 37:26.600]  And I get, I have to get a new inbox because I mean, there's nothing grosser than using
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.120]  somebody's some mouse that somebody's actually used.
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.480]  Years of fingerprints and greasy Cheeto fingers and Oh God.
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.920]  Like I'm, I'm, I'm, I think I'm pretty, uh, I think I have good personal hygiene.
[37:39.920 --> 37:46.020]  Um, I'm not, I'm not a real germaphobe, but like I do have some previously used Apple
[37:46.020 --> 37:49.280]  extended keyboard twos.
[37:49.280 --> 37:51.440]  But when I, whenever I get a new one, I really do.
[37:51.440 --> 37:58.880]  I get all sort of like, uh, like CSI, like crime scene, like cleaning up a, like I, I
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.360]  break out the alcohol and the cotton swipes and, and I mean, I, I go, you know, I get
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.700]  Q tips and I get in there and I'll clean, you know, even if it's scrub it, even if it
[38:07.700 --> 38:12.140]  looks like really like very lightly used, which are the best ones, very lightly used.
[38:12.140 --> 38:15.480]  I I'm going to get in there and scrub it because who the hell knows what people were doing
[38:15.480 --> 38:16.480]  with these things.
[38:16.480 --> 38:17.480]  Oh my God.
[38:17.480 --> 38:20.560]  I no longer eat food while working or any of that.
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.440]  And like my, I just like, my keyboard is should be pristine.
[38:24.440 --> 38:28.200]  And then I'm looking down at it as we're talking and it's like the, some of the number pad
[38:28.200 --> 38:29.800]  is just absolutely disgusting.
[38:29.800 --> 38:30.800]  Like Brown.
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.200]  I do not eat at my desk either.
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.000]  I gave that up many years ago and I still can't believe how disgusting my keyboard can
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.680]  get if I get real close to it.
[38:37.680 --> 38:38.680]  Yeah.
[38:38.680 --> 38:39.680]  It's, it's a little bit frightening to me.
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.320]  Well, I know what I'm doing after this podcast and now it's just, it does sort of put the
[38:44.320 --> 38:47.100]  heebie jeebies in me and I'm looking at it and I'm thinking maybe I should just clean
[38:47.100 --> 38:48.100]  it.
[38:48.100 --> 38:51.520]  Like my own key, even my own keyboard grosses me out like somebody else's.
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.220]  Um, so it's hard for me to really get excited about the new magic mouse cause I know I'm
[38:56.220 --> 38:59.360]  not going to use it because I know it's the same form factor as the old one.
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.000]  And I know that the old form factor to me is extremely uncomfortable to use.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  Yeah.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  I don't like it at all.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  Uh, my boyfriend has one that he will use on occasion.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.400]  Um, but I, I don't know, it just doesn't fit right.
[39:12.400 --> 39:18.360]  My, the only mouse that I have on my desk right now is a very poor man's attempt at
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.960]  a gaming mouse from Mac alley from like, I don't know, 2004 that somehow is still working.
[39:23.960 --> 39:27.960]  That's just a four button mouse and a, and a scroll wheel that I used to use for world
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.240]  of Warcraft of all things.
[39:29.240 --> 39:31.640]  Cause you know, you have to do something in college.
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.560]  But I've been, I've been a trackpad user pretty much since, since the original magic trackpad
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.560]  came out.
[39:37.560 --> 39:44.000]  Um, I mean I was on a laptop for most of college and up until, uh, I got hired at Mac world
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.480]  in 2010 and when they hired me, they're like, Oh, you get an iMac, uh, do you want a mouse
[39:48.480 --> 39:49.480]  or a trackpad?
[39:49.480 --> 39:50.480]  And I'm like, trackpad.
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.040]  Cause that's all I, that's all I'd been, I'd been using aside from the occasional gaming.
[39:54.040 --> 39:55.560]  And that's, that's what I like.
[39:55.560 --> 40:01.000]  I like swipe gestures and even the mouse with its tiny little swipe just as it just did
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.100]  not feel comfortable to me and I feel like the original magic mouse didn't even have
[40:05.100 --> 40:08.380]  like expose or, or mission control support.
[40:08.380 --> 40:12.480]  Like it could two finger swipe between Safari windows, uh, but it couldn't do any of the
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.480]  really cool things.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.480]  The magic trackpad.
[40:14.480 --> 40:18.960]  So it always has felt kind of hamstrung to me in comparison to the trackpad.
[40:18.960 --> 40:23.400]  Like Apple was really only having it to throw a bone to the users who still wanted a mouse
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.760]  to come with their machine, their desktop Mac.
[40:26.760 --> 40:31.840]  But I, especially with the new features of the, this generation's magic trackpad, it
[40:31.840 --> 40:34.040]  just feels like the trackpad blows the mouse out of the water.
[40:34.040 --> 40:36.600]  Like this, this is what you should be using with an iMac.
[40:36.600 --> 40:37.680]  I agree with that.
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.120]  I mean, I'm sure there are other people who are just so used to a mouse that they, I'm
[40:42.120 --> 40:46.880]  sure that's why Apple hasn't gone all trackpad and why the magic mouse still exists and is
[40:46.880 --> 40:47.880]  a thing.
[40:47.880 --> 40:50.320]  But I do, I, that is the other thing I do have at my desk.
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.440]  I have a magic trackpad, I can't say without laughing.
[40:54.440 --> 40:55.440]  I have the old one.
[40:55.440 --> 40:56.440]  I don't have the new one.
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.720]  I have the old one that takes the AA batteries and I don't use it all the time, but I have
[41:00.720 --> 41:06.520]  it there because for certain tasks in certain apps, it's, I find it nicer to have that.
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.440]  Like if I'm editing an image or something like that, it's nice to have it and be able
[41:10.440 --> 41:11.440]  to zoom in.
[41:11.440 --> 41:12.440]  The zoom.
[41:12.440 --> 41:13.440]  Yeah.
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.600]  And for me, I use mission control so much cause I got used to it on the, on my tiny
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.560]  laptops that being able to four finger swipe and get to the desktop and move around and
[41:22.560 --> 41:24.920]  all of that is second nature to me.
[41:24.920 --> 41:31.180]  And especially with El Capitan, adding in things like a swipe to mark as read and mail
[41:31.180 --> 41:34.720]  that it just, it just makes it more of a compelling feature for me.
[41:34.720 --> 41:40.900]  And now that force touch is added, I, I'm still rocking the, the jelly roll, the jelly
[41:40.900 --> 41:42.940]  roll magic trackpad with the AA batteries.
[41:42.940 --> 41:49.940]  But the idea of force touch being able to do different things in the apps right now,
[41:49.940 --> 41:54.520]  it's very, very limited because third party app developers really haven't taken advantage
[41:54.520 --> 41:55.520]  of it at all.
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.240]  Cause the trackpad's only been in the, in the Mac book, which only a small subset of
[42:00.240 --> 42:01.840]  the population owns.
[42:01.840 --> 42:07.520]  But now that that trackpad is now potentially on potentially compatible with every single
[42:07.520 --> 42:10.640]  Mac in the lineup that runs OS X El Capitan.
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.960]  Every single Mac in the lineup that has Bluetooth 4 and runs OS X El Capitan now has the power
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.320]  of force touch and seeing what it can do just in a couple of different apps, you know, even
[42:20.320 --> 42:25.840]  just a quick time player, the demo they love both in the retail stores and when they were
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.360]  demoing the Mac book trackpad is the press, press a little bit to fast forward and then
[42:30.360 --> 42:34.560]  press really deeply and you can fast forward up to, you know, 300 times and then you can
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.680]  lift your finger a little bit and use it like a gas pedal.
[42:37.680 --> 42:43.200]  You know, that's, that's a cool proof of concept, but I feel like especially pro level applications,
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.360]  design applications, drawing applications, photography, force touch is going to be a
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.360]  big deal.
[42:49.360 --> 42:51.040]  Yeah, I agree.
[42:51.040 --> 42:55.200]  I'm tempted by that.
[42:55.200 --> 42:56.200]  Have you seen that?
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.200]  There are people complaining.
[42:57.200 --> 42:58.200]  I know.
[42:58.200 --> 42:59.200]  And Neil Dash tweeted about it.
[42:59.200 --> 43:00.200]  A lot of people.
[43:00.200 --> 43:01.200]  Have you seen the charging?
[43:01.200 --> 43:02.200]  Yeah.
[43:02.200 --> 43:03.200]  Yeah.
[43:03.200 --> 43:04.200]  Oh my God.
[43:04.200 --> 43:05.200]  Okay.
[43:05.200 --> 43:06.200]  So yeah.
[43:06.200 --> 43:07.200]  The charging port.
[43:07.200 --> 43:08.200]  Go ahead.
[43:08.200 --> 43:09.200]  The charging port.
[43:09.200 --> 43:10.200]  It charges by all these new devices.
[43:10.200 --> 43:12.040]  If you don't, if you're not familiar, the one of the big changes in all three of these
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.880]  is that you no longer put batteries.
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.400]  So now does Apple make anything you put batteries in anymore?
[43:18.400 --> 43:19.400]  Maybe the remote?
[43:19.400 --> 43:20.400]  No.
[43:20.400 --> 43:21.400]  Because the remote is lightning.
[43:21.400 --> 43:22.400]  Yeah.
[43:22.400 --> 43:23.400]  The new remote for Apple TV is lightning as well.
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.000]  I think we have gotten away from AA batteries, which I am thrilled by because I have so many
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.640]  useless, slowly dying rechargeable batteries.
[43:34.640 --> 43:36.080]  I did that a couple of years ago.
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.680]  I bought a whole bunch of rechargeable batteries and it was good when Jonas was a real little
[43:40.680 --> 43:43.320]  kid and was using all sorts of toys that took them.
[43:43.320 --> 43:45.280]  I really don't regret it, but no.
[43:45.280 --> 43:49.800]  But they lose their efficacy.
[43:49.800 --> 43:50.800]  It's so bad.
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.760]  I have a serious, I probably have 12 or 14 and it's gotten to the point where I don't
[43:54.760 --> 43:59.280]  know which ones are really poorly charged and which ones are still kind of new.
[43:59.280 --> 44:00.280]  Right.
[44:00.280 --> 44:01.600]  Because once you've charged them, they're all good.
[44:01.600 --> 44:02.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[44:02.600 --> 44:03.600]  Yeah.
[44:03.600 --> 44:06.200]  I wish that they turned a rotten color like fruit.
[44:06.200 --> 44:07.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.760]  Slowly turned eggshell yellow or something weird like that.
[44:10.760 --> 44:15.300]  My trackpad, I'm lucky if my trackpad and my keyboard last a day.
[44:15.300 --> 44:21.240]  If I had been smart, what I would have done is maybe gotten in the habit of marking them
[44:21.240 --> 44:22.240]  or something.
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.720]  Yeah, like a tally mark with a Sharpie.
[44:23.720 --> 44:27.520]  Every time I charge this battery, do a tally mark and you can see which ones you've done
[44:27.520 --> 44:28.520]  the most.
[44:28.520 --> 44:29.520]  But anyway, I've sort of-
[44:29.520 --> 44:30.520]  But now you don't need to do it.
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.700]  But now I've gotten off, I've gotten back to just using door cells and then I feel guilty
[44:34.700 --> 44:35.700]  about it though.
[44:35.700 --> 44:41.440]  Yeah, I do because I know that it's sort of a rotten environment.
[44:41.440 --> 44:42.440]  I don't know.
[44:42.440 --> 44:45.000]  Is Philly one of the places in Boston?
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.080]  You can't throw them away.
[44:46.080 --> 44:48.280]  Like you have to dispose of them in a special place.
[44:48.280 --> 44:52.840]  So if you use a non-rechargeable battery, at least in my house, it's very much like
[44:52.840 --> 44:57.360]  either, it goes in a bucket where we're like, yeah, we'll take this to the special recycling
[44:57.360 --> 44:59.500]  department someday.
[44:59.500 --> 45:03.160]  And then it just sits there in your house forever and ever just kind of gathering dust.
[45:03.160 --> 45:08.080]  In Philly, we take them to sporting events and throw them at the opposing teams.
[45:08.080 --> 45:09.080]  That sounds like you guys.
[45:09.080 --> 45:15.040]  It's like peanuts, except they're a little bit more potential of explosion if you set
[45:15.040 --> 45:18.560]  them on fire.
[45:18.560 --> 45:23.920]  So here's the thing that is a minor design controversy is that the new Magic Mouse has,
[45:23.920 --> 45:30.600]  I think, the exact same, when it's sitting on a desk, it looks identical to the old one,
[45:30.600 --> 45:32.800]  has the exact same profile.
[45:32.800 --> 45:36.400]  Has different feet, according to the design team at Apple.
[45:36.400 --> 45:37.880]  But I don't think they look different.
[45:37.880 --> 45:45.440]  I think that there's, you know, Steven Levy at Backchannel on Medium had a great behind
[45:45.440 --> 45:50.520]  the scenes talk with the team that made these things, and they talked about how they somehow
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.740]  with the weight being different from the new battery, that they had to redesign the feet
[45:55.740 --> 46:00.220]  to make the click sound right.
[46:00.220 --> 46:03.760]  But anyway, the complaint that people have is that the lightning port is on the bottom.
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.240]  So if you want to charge this thing, you have to turn it on its side or turn it upside down
[46:07.240 --> 46:09.760]  and stick a lightning port in.
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.440]  And therefore, while it's charging, you cannot use it as a mouse.
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.800]  And what everybody seems to or the complainer seem to think is common sense is that the
[46:17.800 --> 46:23.380]  lightning port should be at the front of the mouse, so that you could plug it in and use
[46:23.380 --> 46:26.600]  it like you would a wired just to use it like a mouse.
[46:26.600 --> 46:32.040]  Yeah, except for the fact that I've seen a nails mock up, or it's like, yeah, just have
[46:32.040 --> 46:34.960]  this little hole in the front of the mouse.
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.260]  It'll be fine, except I can just I can just see five different people at Apple being like,
[46:39.260 --> 46:42.520]  that is the most hideous thing I've ever seen in my life.
[46:42.520 --> 46:49.080]  And so I don't know, it just for on top of that, we should also mention the fact that
[46:49.080 --> 46:54.660]  this mouse does not take a extremely long time to charge two minutes supposedly gives
[46:54.660 --> 46:55.660]  you nine hours.
[46:55.660 --> 46:56.660]  It gives you a day.
[46:56.660 --> 46:58.660]  So the idea.
[46:58.660 --> 47:03.200]  So you can charge it if you came to work, and your mouse was dead, you could charge
[47:03.200 --> 47:05.420]  it and you would have to wait to start using it.
[47:05.420 --> 47:08.880]  But you could just use that as like your minute to get your standing coffee.
[47:08.880 --> 47:09.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[47:09.880 --> 47:11.880]  We're standing for your watch.
[47:11.880 --> 47:17.200]  And then by the time you've got your standing point, your your Apple mouse, your math magic
[47:17.200 --> 47:20.760]  mouse two would be charged for the day.
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.660]  And it does give you the other thing too is it gives you just you know, if you for any
[47:25.660 --> 47:30.840]  of you who haven't used these peripherals, they do the system is in touch with them.
[47:30.840 --> 47:34.140]  And when they get low, you do get a warning on screen.
[47:34.140 --> 47:36.520]  And it's not like an emergency warning.
[47:36.520 --> 47:39.720]  It's like, you know, you're gonna want to charge this thing.
[47:39.720 --> 47:40.720]  Yeah.
[47:40.720 --> 47:45.220]  You know, I'm actually I'm kind of mad that the ports are on the back for the magic trackpad
[47:45.220 --> 47:46.220]  and the magic.
[47:46.220 --> 47:47.220]  And is it a magic keyboard?
[47:47.220 --> 47:48.220]  Is it just a keyboard?
[47:48.220 --> 47:50.800]  Let's see, it's just called a keyboard.
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.120]  Yeah, no, it is a magic keyboard.
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.240]  It's a magic keyboard.
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.440]  It's magic magic all the way down.
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.440]  I think that might be a new name, though, because it's the magic trackpad two and the
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.140]  magic mouse two, but it's just a magic keyboard magic keyboard.
[48:05.140 --> 48:10.900]  Because it has the new not butterfly mechanism, but different scissor mechanism than previous
[48:10.900 --> 48:11.900]  keyboards.
[48:11.900 --> 48:17.180]  Yeah, yeah, I, I kind of feel like I'm in tune of the with the standing notification
[48:17.180 --> 48:21.840]  idea where why don't why aren't all of the ports on the underside and then then it just
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.520]  forces you to get up off of your desk while you're charging your accessories.
[48:25.520 --> 48:30.000]  Sorry, your accessories literally are going to stop working unless you get out of your
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.320]  seat.
[48:32.320 --> 48:34.840]  It seems it seems subversively funny to me.
[48:34.840 --> 48:37.840]  But I don't I honestly don't know what the what the fuss is about.
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.700]  I think that Apple first and foremost wants to obviously design functional things, but
[48:42.700 --> 48:46.240]  also design accessories that are going to look nice.
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.520]  And the worst, the worst thing I think in the world would be to give you a wireless
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.640]  mouse and then be here, we're going to make it so that you can absolutely use it as a
[48:56.640 --> 49:02.120]  wired mouse because how many I don't want to say stupid idiots, how many stupid idiots
[49:02.120 --> 49:05.560]  are just going to plug in their peripherals and then just keep them plugged in the entire
[49:05.560 --> 49:06.560]  time.
[49:06.560 --> 49:07.560]  Oh, I don't want to charge them.
[49:07.560 --> 49:10.880]  They are, you know, things always burn down.
[49:10.880 --> 49:19.360]  I think that if the existing profile of the Magic Mouse had a flat front, then they might
[49:19.360 --> 49:21.040]  have just put the port there.
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.920]  But it's the fact that they're clearly happy with the profile of the Magic trackpad where
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.960]  the front and back, you know, it's it's exactly symmetric.
[49:30.960 --> 49:34.340]  And it has there is no there's there is nowhere for it to go.
[49:34.340 --> 49:41.080]  So anybody who's asking for them to put the port so that you can use it while it's charging
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.600]  is asking for them to redesign the whole mouse.
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.200]  Yeah, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.720]  But it's, it doesn't, you know, it just does not seem like a problem.
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.000]  And I also think, on the other hand, I think exactly what you said, I think it might even
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  be deliberate.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.920]  It may, it may actually be that they want to discourage people from using it while charging.
[50:01.920 --> 50:02.920]  Yeah.
[50:02.920 --> 50:06.520]  I'm not quite sure then why they didn't do the same with the keyboard and the trackpad.
[50:06.520 --> 50:08.760]  Yeah, which is which is my my wonder.
[50:08.760 --> 50:13.320]  No, I honestly think that, you know, if you're if you're talking about technology that went
[50:13.320 --> 50:18.140]  into these peripherals, again, the mouse feels like the odd man out here where the trackpad
[50:18.140 --> 50:23.040]  gets force touch and all of this new and the keyboard is completely redesigned and should
[50:23.040 --> 50:24.220]  type better.
[50:24.220 --> 50:28.480]  And the mouse is, it has lightning now.
[50:28.480 --> 50:33.520]  You know, I know that there was design work going that went into the mouse because of
[50:33.520 --> 50:35.280]  Steven Levy's excellent article.
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.800]  And also, I know that even if something looks identical, Apple spends a lot of time on it
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.600]  regardless.
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.740]  But I do think what you were saying is absolutely correct, where in order for them to put a
[50:46.740 --> 50:51.000]  lightning port on the front and make it not look like a piece of crap, they're going to
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.280]  have to redesign it.
[50:52.280 --> 50:56.220]  And if they're going to redesign the mouse, then they might as well redesign it in such
[50:56.220 --> 51:00.960]  a way that they can also put force touch in it, which I think right now is probably too
[51:00.960 --> 51:05.600]  challenging given the curvature of the mouse and the, you know, current initial limits
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.880]  of force touch.
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.160]  So I mean, it may eventually happen, but I just I think they ran up against time and
[51:13.160 --> 51:16.480]  hardware limitations to actually put that together.
[51:16.480 --> 51:22.080]  And it's like, well, do you want a mouse that has a port on the front of it for slightly
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.360]  easier charging?
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.960]  Or do you want force touch on your trackpad?
[51:25.960 --> 51:26.960]  Pick one.
[51:26.960 --> 51:29.320]  You can only have one.
[51:29.320 --> 51:33.040]  And I'm guessing the majority of people are going to say, yeah, we'd prefer force touch
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.040]  on the trackpad.
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.040]  Why?
[51:35.040 --> 51:38.720]  Why do we care about a charging port location?
[51:38.720 --> 51:42.680]  The other thing, last thing about these three peripherals is the price.
[51:42.680 --> 51:43.680]  Yes.
[51:43.680 --> 51:46.880]  And this is very classic Apple.
[51:46.880 --> 51:48.880]  The keyboard is 99 bucks.
[51:48.880 --> 51:49.880]  Of course.
[51:49.880 --> 51:50.880]  Which is a lot for a keyboard.
[51:50.880 --> 51:52.040]  Was it 79 before?
[51:52.040 --> 51:53.040]  I think so.
[51:53.040 --> 52:00.600]  The trackpad is $129 and the mouse is, how much is the mouse?
[52:00.600 --> 52:01.600]  59, 69.
[52:01.600 --> 52:02.600]  79.
[52:02.600 --> 52:03.600]  79.
[52:03.600 --> 52:05.840]  So the mouse and the keyboard are the same price.
[52:05.840 --> 52:08.000]  No, the keyboard's 99.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  99.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.120]  The keyboard used to be 79.
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.520]  So the mouse moves up to the keyboard's price.
[52:12.520 --> 52:18.360]  The keyboard's a hundred bucks and the trackpad is a very, a very quintessential Apple number
[52:18.360 --> 52:19.360]  $129.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.360]  Yeah.
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.360]  It's a lot.
[52:21.360 --> 52:22.360]  Yeah.
[52:22.360 --> 52:29.240]  I mean, I, I understand the technology in the mouse or in the trackpad at least.
[52:29.240 --> 52:33.320]  Force touch to me seems like the kind of thing where you might need to charge a premium for
[52:33.320 --> 52:36.800]  it based on all of the mechanics that are under the hood.
[52:36.800 --> 52:41.920]  It's not just a mouse, but it's still $129 for a slab of a metal.
[52:41.920 --> 52:46.840]  The Amazon basics three button USB wired mouse is $699.
[52:46.840 --> 52:51.800]  What's the Amazon basics wireless mouse?
[52:51.800 --> 52:52.960]  Now it's expensive.
[52:52.960 --> 52:56.340]  That's $11 and 49 cents.
[52:56.340 --> 53:01.460]  So if you want a mouse, I seem to remember that in previous iMac versions, you could
[53:01.460 --> 53:06.140]  choose between the mouse or the keyboard or the trackpad and they wouldn't charge you.
[53:06.140 --> 53:08.600]  And now they upcharge you 50 bucks.
[53:08.600 --> 53:12.520]  If you want to go from the mouse to the keyboard, you mean the mouse to the trackpad?
[53:12.520 --> 53:13.520]  Yes.
[53:13.520 --> 53:14.520]  The mouse to a keyboard is 50.
[53:14.520 --> 53:15.520]  No.
[53:15.520 --> 53:16.520]  Oh yeah.
[53:16.520 --> 53:19.640]  That used to be like a, that used to be, you choose your, choose your poison.
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.420]  And now they're actually discouraging people from going to the trackpad, which seems like
[53:24.420 --> 53:28.680]  such a, seems like such the wrong thing to do if you want to get more people using force
[53:28.680 --> 53:36.800]  touch and more people comfortable with a trackpad or, and, or you could get both the magic mouse
[53:36.800 --> 53:41.640]  to and the magic trackpad to for $129 because you wanted multiple peripherals or you could
[53:41.640 --> 53:43.360]  get a wired Apple mouse for no money.
[53:43.360 --> 53:44.560]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[53:44.560 --> 53:45.560]  I think you're right.
[53:45.560 --> 53:50.520]  I think it fundamentally comes down to the fact that force touch is the, or 3d touch,
[53:50.520 --> 53:57.140]  whatever we're calling it, is the new, you know, hotness and it's, you know, it probably
[53:57.140 --> 53:58.140]  is more expensive.
[53:58.140 --> 54:04.000]  I really doubt that it costs $129 that much more, you know, but multiply it by Apple's
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.360]  standard margin and maybe, you know, maybe it is the right price.
[54:09.360 --> 54:10.360]  But it really does.
[54:10.360 --> 54:17.240]  It is one of those remaining things that stands out from the Mac and the commodity mouse market.
[54:17.240 --> 54:22.120]  As I sit here and look at this, you know, I just opened up an Amazon.com tab and just
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.520]  type mouse.
[54:24.520 --> 54:27.680]  It's like you can find, here's a Logitech for $21, $22.
[54:27.680 --> 54:28.680]  Yeah.
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.040]  If you want an, and you know what, the high quality mice, that's the funny thing is like
[54:33.040 --> 54:39.760]  Rick has a high quality silent wireless gaming mouse on his, on his desk that I'm pretty
[54:39.760 --> 54:42.200]  sure he paid maybe $70 for.
[54:42.200 --> 54:45.400]  Yeah, I'm sure you can, but it's, you know.
[54:45.400 --> 54:49.400]  But even that, that's less than the price of the Apple magic mouse too.
[54:49.400 --> 54:50.400]  Right.
[54:50.400 --> 54:51.400]  I mean, here's one.
[54:51.400 --> 54:59.200]  It looks like something from Ironman YCC team, 4,000 DPI, 10 button, LED optical, USB wired
[54:59.200 --> 55:00.880]  professional gaming mouse.
[55:00.880 --> 55:03.080]  Why does a gaming mouse need dots per inch?
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.560]  Well it's for the, it's the dots per inch is the sensor, the laser, in other words how
[55:07.560 --> 55:08.560]  precise it is.
[55:08.560 --> 55:10.040]  It actually is pretty important.
[55:10.040 --> 55:11.760]  Oh yeah.
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.500]  I've never, I've never heard that term because I am a very casual Mac gamer, but that's,
[55:16.500 --> 55:17.500]  that makes sense.
[55:17.500 --> 55:18.500]  I'm not a gamer.
[55:18.500 --> 55:22.120]  I haven't played a game on my Mac in I think over 10 years, maybe longer, but I'm very
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.240]  sensitive to that because that's why I use my old mouse with the ball because it has
[55:25.240 --> 55:26.240]  a really high DPI.
[55:26.240 --> 55:27.240]  Precision.
[55:27.240 --> 55:28.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[55:28.240 --> 55:29.600]  So that I can jack the speed up with the mouse.
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.100]  So I actually, that's one of the weird things I know about the gaming world, but anyway,
[55:34.100 --> 55:38.640]  all of these mice, like $7.00.
[55:38.640 --> 55:39.640]  Oh boy.
[55:39.640 --> 55:40.640]  But Apple can do it.
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.560]  That's the thing is that they, I mean these, the peripherals, I know Renee has been going
[55:45.560 --> 55:49.080]  to the store pretty much every day to try and get them and they, their limited supply
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.720]  every day and every day sold out, sold out, sold out.
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.960]  So people are buying these horrendously expensive peripherals, even the Magic Mouse.
[55:57.960 --> 56:01.400]  Well, I don't even know if it's, it is expensive.
[56:01.400 --> 56:02.640]  Yeah, there's no way around it.
[56:02.640 --> 56:04.080]  I don't know that it's too expensive though.
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.440]  I'm not complaining about it, but it's, you know, it's the price you pay for, you know,
[56:09.440 --> 56:10.600]  Apple's cutting edge stuff.
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.940]  For not, for, for no batteries, for lithium ion batteries in a keyboard and a trackpad,
[56:15.940 --> 56:21.360]  I would pay, you know, $129 for that set.
[56:21.360 --> 56:24.520]  If I was buying it to upgrade to my current Mac, yeah, I would do that in a heartbeat
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.920]  because anything that requires me never to use batteries again is worth that upcharge
[56:29.920 --> 56:32.680]  and Force Touch is worth that upcharge.
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.240]  I do hate that they're referring it to Force Touch as Force Touch on the Mac and 3D Touch
[56:37.240 --> 56:38.520]  on the phone.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  That is driving me crazy.
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.840]  Well, I think I've asked about it and it's one of those questions that they have a prepared
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.620]  answer for that doesn't really answer it, but they're ready for it.
[56:48.620 --> 56:55.880]  But I think translating it from their non-answer to a real answer is, I think it's twofold.
[56:55.880 --> 57:01.280]  I think one, they were calling it Force Touch everywhere and then they decided that, I think
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.080]  they kind of bought into, or at least recognize the arguments that people have that it sounds
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.440]  like it could be a little creepy or violent or something.
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.560]  That there's other, you know, there's other ways to interpret those words that aren't
[57:13.560 --> 57:17.480]  a positive connotation.
[57:17.480 --> 57:24.720]  And I think secondarily, they've talked themselves into not just renaming it 3D Touch everywhere.
[57:24.720 --> 57:31.400]  Because I think Force Touch is sort of binary, where it's either a regular touch or a Force
[57:31.400 --> 57:32.600]  Touch and that's it.
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.600]  And 3D Touch has, I just read it.
[57:36.600 --> 57:37.600]  3D.
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.840]  Yeah, well it has, it measures degree of touch.
[57:40.840 --> 57:46.160]  So like, just the one way that Apple exposes it, currently in iOS 9, is with the peak and
[57:46.160 --> 57:49.200]  pop, where there's two levels of touch.
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.920]  And I just read an article, I guess I should try to find it in the show notes, I read an
[57:53.920 --> 57:58.700]  article where somebody was playing with the APIs and effectively a developer could probably
[57:58.700 --> 58:01.920]  get six levels of touch if you wanted to.
[58:01.920 --> 58:06.280]  And where you might want to use that, maybe in a game, you know, some kind of game where
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.120]  you have six levels, you know, maybe for acceleration in a driving or racing game.
[58:12.120 --> 58:16.760]  Maybe in some kind of musical app where you're playing the Force Touch as trying to get music
[58:16.760 --> 58:17.760]  out of it.
[58:17.760 --> 58:18.760]  Drums or something like that.
[58:18.760 --> 58:21.820]  But you can pretty much go like one to six.
[58:21.820 --> 58:25.800]  And that's 3D Touch, like it had, you know, and Force Touch, though, is either just it
[58:25.800 --> 58:27.640]  is a Force Touch, or it's a regular touch.
[58:27.640 --> 58:28.640]  And that's it.
[58:28.640 --> 58:30.440]  Yeah, well, that's, but that's what it is on the watch.
[58:30.440 --> 58:34.760]  And that's what interests me about the desktop is that the Force Touch trackpad on a MacBook
[58:34.760 --> 58:39.160]  is not you press or you're not like it does have, it does have degrees of sensitivity
[58:39.160 --> 58:41.420]  and layers in it.
[58:41.420 --> 58:43.120]  But they're still kind of playing with that idea.
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.520]  Yeah, I don't know that the APIs are there on the Mac, though.
[58:45.520 --> 58:46.520]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[58:46.520 --> 58:47.520]  I don't know.
[58:47.520 --> 58:48.760]  I think they should just call it 3D Touch.
[58:48.760 --> 58:50.040]  Yeah, I like 3D Touch.
[58:50.040 --> 58:51.560]  I think 3D Touch is appropriate.
[58:51.560 --> 58:57.240]  And the interesting thing, it's funny that developers can only access six levels of pressure
[58:57.240 --> 59:03.120]  in sort of apps, because Peter Skinner from 10.1 did, of course, an initial test for the
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.600]  pressure sensitivity in drawing apps.
[59:05.600 --> 59:10.260]  And he was able to detect over 400 potential levels of pressure sensitivity when it came
[59:10.260 --> 59:11.540]  to drawing alone.
[59:11.540 --> 59:15.720]  So there's a lot, there's actually a lot of functionality built into that little screen
[59:15.720 --> 59:20.240]  that maybe isn't quite exposed to developers for regular apps, because maybe it just doesn't
[59:20.240 --> 59:23.160]  make sense to have that kind of finite pressure.
[59:23.160 --> 59:27.640]  I mean, most it that that's so many levels of pressure that the average human is not
[59:27.640 --> 59:33.700]  going to understand that they've shoved through 50 to get from step one to step two.
[59:33.700 --> 59:36.040]  But from a drawing perspective, that's actually really exciting.
[59:36.040 --> 59:41.920]  And one of the things I kind of want to play with once we get the the new, I almost call
[59:41.920 --> 59:43.520]  it the force touch trackpad.
[59:43.520 --> 59:49.760]  Once we get the new magic trackpad, I'm really curious to see how, you know, if if precious
[59:49.760 --> 59:54.400]  sensitive drawing is going to be enabled, if it's something that the that the magic
[59:54.400 --> 59:57.840]  trackpad can do, or whether they're going to just limit it to the iPhone for this this
[59:57.840 --> 59:58.840]  time around.
[59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.920]  Yeah, well, what do you think you would do the drawing with though?
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.980]  Well, no, I mean, you could do it with a faint to see the thing.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:09.280]  The interesting thing for me, at least on a on a Mac, you could use a stylus arguably
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.520]  because that that glass is now so big that it kind of it almost reminds me of like a
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:21.120]  Wacom bamboo tablet, like a really early 512 levels of pressure sensitivity tablet.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:27.400]  But what would be cool for me is using it in something like pixelmator or Lightroom,
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.200]  where you use it to shade or to like to do color correction in various levels where you
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:38.400]  don't need the specific pinpoint pinpoint accuracy if you were just drawing very tiny
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400]  lines.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.560]  So if you're, you know, color correcting, or if you're removing splotches or anything
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:49.700]  like that, being able to have levels of pressure, like this is how this is how much I want to,
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.720]  you know, this is how much color I want to take away in a D saturation.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.880]  Yeah, the pressure is more important than the than the pixel precision.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.000]  At least in these early days, at least in certain tasks like that.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.280]  Exactly.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.700]  And even the pixel precision is not too bad when you have zoom at your disposal.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.800]  And I can very easily see you pinch and then you use one finger to sketch.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.960]  That's what I've been doing on the on the phone and it's been working really well.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.440]  All right, let's take a break.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.740]  And I will thank our second sponsor and it's our good friends at automatic.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.480]  They just spell it the regular way auto matic.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]  And what is it?
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.920]  It is really cool.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.160]  It is a connected car adapter.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.400]  I call it a dingus.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.720]  It plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.960]  Now, every car made, I think, since like nineteen ninety seven, but somewhere around there has
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960]  one of these.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.120]  It's a standard port.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.760]  It goes across manufacturers.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.040]  Your car has one.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.400]  You just find out where it is on your car.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.800]  It's somewhere underneath the dashboard.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:55.120]  You plug this little dingus into it and it's exactly the same port that like the mechanic
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.800]  uses when you take your car in the shop and like if your car's dashboard says you need
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.260]  like service a one, you could just use automatic.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.880]  And it tells you exactly what that means, because they have an app.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.320]  Here's how you you you you plug the thing in the car, then you don't have to worry about
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]  it anymore.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.360]  Then after that, you just use the app and it communicates it with Bluetooth between
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.940]  you and your car.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.660]  And it tells you everything that goes through there.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.400]  So any kind of like engine light warning or something like that, automatic will explain
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.800]  in plain English what the heck is going on, you know, whether you just need an oil change,
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.060]  whether you're due for some kind of bigger service, whether something is failing gives
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.660]  you a log of your trips.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.920]  It keeps track of your parking location.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.720]  So if you if you have, you know, if you don't have like a garage or something like that
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.080]  and you, you know, forget where your car is, automatic knows where your car is every single
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.560]  time you park it.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.960]  It even can call emergency services in the case of an accident.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.540]  It scores you on your driving if you want it to.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.600]  So you can set goals for fuel efficiency and stuff like that and will give you hints and
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.640]  tell you when you're, you know, when you're going over your limits and stuff like that.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.760]  The new thing they have this year and it was already cool just doing all that stuff.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.560]  The new thing they have this year is they have an app store for automatic and they have
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.080]  over 20 apps available and that lets you use your car's data in all kinds of ways.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.660]  So for example, they've got integration with nest.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.660]  So you can let your thermostat know when you're getting close to home.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.800]  You can say when I'm, you know, five miles away from home, do this with the temperature
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.040]  in your house or 10 miles or whatever you want it to be.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040]  You don't have to do anything.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.820]  You set it up and then it just works like that.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.820]  It's amazing.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.140]  It really seems like the future.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:45.540]  And they've got integration with IFTTT that's if then then that if this then that really
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.000]  great web service which you should check out on your own anyway for hooking up all sorts
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  of nerdy stuff.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.180]  But then you can make your own recipes and do all sorts of custom stuff based on this
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.400]  really, really cool.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.000]  Long story short, if you have a car, you really want this.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  It's amazing.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.180]  This sort of thing should be built into every car, but it's not.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.600]  But it's pretty awesome that it works with everybody's car.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.880]  It's 100 bucks normally, which is a great deal.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]  And there's no service fee.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.420]  You don't pay like 10 bucks a month or whatever.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.960]  You just give them the 100 bucks.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.720]  You get the dingus and then you own it and that's it.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.360]  But even better than that, you could save 20% off.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.440]  That's 20 bucks.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:26.320]  Buy it for $80 and it ships in two business days and they have a 45-day return policy.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.920]  That's how confident they are that you're going to like it.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.640]  So buy it for 80 bucks with this code.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.160]  Go to automatic.com slash the talk show and get yourself this automatic dingus if you
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.320]  haven't gotten one already.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.520]  Really cool.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.960]  Anything else on the peripherals?
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.320]  No, I think I'm good there for peripherals after all.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.560]  I was thinking it seems a little silly because it's only October and I'm not like a big year
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.440]  in review sort of person.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.360]  I usually don't do anything like that.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.320]  But I think we're at the point now, though, where we kind of know everything that Apple's
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320]  done for 2015.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320]  I mean, we're still waiting.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.680]  Or that they have coming, yeah.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.840]  The iPad Pro is obviously a huge thing that's coming.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]  It's probably the...
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]  It's looming.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840]  Right.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.560]  It's the biggest, literally, well, biggest iOS device, I guess.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.360]  It's not bigger than a 27-inch iMac, but it's probably the biggest hardware announcement
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360]  of the year.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.680]  And we don't have it in our hands yet.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.440]  But we know it's coming.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.560]  I think the Apple has shown all of their cards.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:34.260]  And it actually is, to me, as much as like for the year or two prior, there were a lot
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.920]  of complaints that Apple was sort of silent for lunch.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920]  Wasn't innovating, yeah.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920]  Wasn't innovating.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.760]  The dealers can't innovate anymore, my ass thing at WWDC.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.960]  It was obviously frustrating to them.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.140]  It's one of those things where I feel like you can complain about it when they're quiet
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.140]  for a long time.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.680]  But then when they have a busy year, nobody really says, wow, they've really done a lot
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.680]  this year.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.120]  But they've done a lot this year.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.360]  A spectacular amount when you really think about all of...
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:06.640]  I mean, they launched an entirely new product, the Apple Watch.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.760]  We got new iPhones.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.180]  We got new dev kits.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:20.660]  Two new versions of iOS and OS X, which people, I think, overlook just how much work goes
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.720]  into creating solid software.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.480]  And they really did, I feel like, make solid software this time around on both iOS and
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480]  OS X.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.200]  It doesn't feel nearly as bunky to me right off the line.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200]  We got new iPhones.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200]  Apple TV.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200]  I forgot about that.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.000]  That's still to come, too.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.800]  That's looming end of October, early November.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.400]  I want to emphasize that as we record this, I do not have an Apple TV.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.640]  I worry that somebody is going to go, oh, you know, Gruber says he's only waiting on
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.640]  an iPad Pro.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.640]  He must have an Apple TV in the house.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640]  I do not.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640]  I do not.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.880]  But no, but that's coming.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:01.300]  And the other two really big things to me are the photos, the new integrated photos
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:05.580]  that launched in iCloud Photos and Apple Music.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:13.060]  And so there's these two things that, you know, music and your photos and videos that
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:19.240]  in 2015, Apple has introduced entirely new and, you know, not necessarily in both cases,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:26.100]  in either case, seamlessly, but they've certainly laid the foundation for the future of how
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.640]  people in the Apple, you know, customers in the Apple ecosystem are going to manage their
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.040]  photos and music.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040]  Absolutely.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.760]  You know, I did a lot of work on both of those topics right as they were coming out.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:44.240]  And as the year has progressed, you know, Apple has been very, very good about listening
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:50.560]  to customer feedback and implementing, you know, implementing changes or fixes or bug,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.080]  you know, bug fixes to make the experience better.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.520]  You know, I think about the initial iCloud Photo Library and the new Photos app, I couldn't
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.520]  turn around on the internet, virtually turn around without seeing someone being like,
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520]  how dare you?
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.520]  This sucks.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.520]  I miss Aperture.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.640]  I'm moving to Lightroom.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.600]  Everything is terrible.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.780]  And now there, I feel like quite a few people are using photos or they're using Google's
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.240]  photo service or they're using, you know, they've found their photo service or they're
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.780]  willing to give photos a try and there's, there's no big calamity.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.620]  Apple hasn't lost someone's entire photo library.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.080]  There's no, there's been no insanity there.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.600]  There was a little insanity over Apple Music.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.720]  Yeah, let's do Photos first because I feel like it was the smoother launch.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720]  It was.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.400]  And I'm really impressed by it.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400]  I really am.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.480]  I know it works really, really well for me.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:53.360]  There was one, one time early on with a photo on my iPhone where I had, let me see how many
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.720]  photos I've got in there now just to put a scale on.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.720]  Oh yeah.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720]  We can compare.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720]  Uh, you probably have more.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  I'll bet.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:06.360]  I've got 16,956 photos and 237 videos.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360]  Yep.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.920]  You might have me beat on videos, but I'm pretty sure I have you beat on photos.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.080]  I don't have a lot of videos on there because I used to store them separately.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.440]  I do have videos in here.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440]  Nevermind.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:23.760]  I'm, I'm guessing most of that was recently shot, but 26,896 photos, 855 videos and three
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  items.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.600]  I don't actually know what items are.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:35.240]  I had, I had a, I had a situation early in this summer or no, maybe it like it was at
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.000]  the point where I upgraded to iOS nine beta on my, on my phone and it was a beta.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.920]  So I, this is why I didn't complain about it publicly, but I had a situation where there,
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.760]  the count wasn't the same across all my devices.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.480]  It was slightly off.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.300]  And I figured it out that it came down to a photo I had taken on my iPhone about two
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:01.340]  weeks prior in which I had edited and I forget if I only edited it.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.160]  I did it on the phone and I forget if I use the photos app on the phone to adjust the
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:10.640]  color or something, or if I used like afterlife or one of those third party apps that lets
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.560]  you modify images on your photo roll in place without making a copy.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:24.100]  But it was edited and for whatever reason it was not able to sync that photo to to iCloud.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.740]  So I emailed it to myself so I'd have a copy of the edited version.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:34.120]  Then I deleted it and then everything got caught up and then I took the emailed photo
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.600]  and put it back into photos.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.020]  So one time, and it was with a beta, so I'm not complaining.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.000]  And ever since then it's, it has been great.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Yeah.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.800]  Well, I, and I think, you know, comparing this a little bit to the Apple Music Rollout,
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.600]  the beta process was really important for this.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.320]  Being able to have the months where they're like, yes, this is beta.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.960]  We definitely want people to come play in the beta.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.040]  So please, if you're interested, but this is a beta service and please be advised this
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.000]  is a beta service and please back up your photos.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.360]  And once people, I think, realized, well, first of all, knew that going in and also
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.880]  were able to figure out, oh, this is the difference between storing all of your photos on your
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.960]  device and optimizing storage.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.360]  And this is what this app gets me that Aputure or Lightroom does not.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.240]  They had more time to kind of figure all of that out.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:35.160]  I too had, I had one really bad photos experience and that was mostly, I had at this, at the
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.640]  time that photos was released or, or initially sort of announced, I was really excited about
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.480]  this because my photo library had been spread across four different computers.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.360]  And I thought at one point I had it all localized on the 15 inch iMac, but as, as time went
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.840]  on, it kind of more and more got over to my, or 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:00.360]  As time went on, it became more on, on my old 21.5 inch iMac and a little bit on my,
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:06.600]  my MacBook Air, and I was just saving like giant folders of iPhone images.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.800]  Every time my iPhone would get full, I'd just dump everything via image capture into a folder
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.960]  and just shove it into Dropbox.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.840]  So it was like there was some canonical version of my photos somewhere.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.820]  And when I went to merge everything into photos, one, my MacBook Air library wouldn't sync.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:29.600]  And eventually I just had to create a new, I had to create a new library and pull down
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.000]  all of the photos from the cloud and then upload everything.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.720]  It was trying, it just got into a terrible loop where it was trying to download and upload
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720]  at the same time.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.320]  And they just, you know, essentially the, you know, the virtual pipe was clogged so
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  nothing could get anywhere.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.040]  And it just said uploading forever.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.020]  But again, once I, like that was a very simple troubleshoot and I talked to Apple and almost
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020]  immediately got that fixed.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.040]  And once I got that fixed, no problems.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.040]  Everything's great.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]  Yeah.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.440]  The other thing that really works well, and it sounds simple and I know there's other
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.440]  services that do this, I'm not saying Apple has invented anything.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.560]  I'm just saying that at scale for all of the people who use iCloud photos, it seems to
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.940]  be working well, is the way that like you can say whether or not you want all of your
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.920]  photos on this device or not, or you would just want the thumbnails and pull them down
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.920]  over the cloud as needed to save space.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.440]  And having gone through the, the, again, this is, I'm not complaining.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.080]  It's, you know, it's a great, it's great that I get access to the iPhones and stuff beforehand.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.440]  But I set up an awful lot of iOS devices every year because I get two new iPhones and then
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.320]  I buy my own iPhone.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.280]  Having set up my own iPhones for personal use a lot and over the last month or two,
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.400]  it's worked really, really great where it's obviously they're not, you know, 16 or 17,000
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.400]  photos.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.640]  Even the thumbnails are not there, you know, a minute or two after you unlock, you know,
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]  unwrap the phone.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.320]  But, you know, within a very reasonable amount of time they are.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.440]  And it's, it's, to me, really impressive and it solves a problem that we've had for a long
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440]  time.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.900]  Yeah, well, just the not having to worry about what device I take photos on is huge.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:17.040]  And not like, and just in every day too, obviously, most people don't necessarily have a job where
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.480]  they're taking tons of product photos on maybe and then uploading them to one machine and
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.500]  maybe need access to them on another machine at a later point in time.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.480]  But that kind of workflow, I feel like, is universal for different documents.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.880]  And Apple seems to have really done a great thing with photos where I can, again, snap
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.060]  a screenshot or snap a photo of like an Apple Watch jock and three seconds later it shows
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:47.280]  up on my Mac where I need to upload it to our CMS for our website.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.440]  And that, it just, it makes it easier.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.320]  I don't have to worry about where my photos are because I know that like, okay, they're
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.240]  all in the cloud and then I have a backup, a physical backup, on one of my computers
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.760]  and then I have a double backup in Dropbox and it's like, that's, it's just, it feels
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760]  really nice.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.520]  The one niggle that I have with optimized storage is that I do wish that your favorites
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.820]  album was automatically stored on device.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.920]  Like I wish there was an album that you could just be like, this album needs to be stored
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.220]  locally because the annoying thing of like tapping something that you want to share with
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:28.620]  somebody and then seeing the, the doubt, the slow download icon and realizing currently
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.420]  iCloud photos is limited to wifi to download any photo.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:37.720]  So if you want to get an old photo from, you know, 1996 or something that you have stored,
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.240]  chances are if you haven't looked at it frequently, it's not, it's stored up in the library.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:46.340]  It's not stored on device if you have optimize on and if you're not on wifi, you can't download
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340]  that.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.020]  And so all you can see is this really blurry picture.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.960]  Even if you're just looking at, you want to just browse photos while you're stuck on an
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.680]  airplane or something that that's a little frustrating, but it's not, you know, it's
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.680]  not a deal breaker.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.960]  It's not necessarily something where I'm like, Apple, how could you?
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.880]  But it would be nice to have like to have a space of like these photos will always stay
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.880]  on my device.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.780]  I always want to look at these pictures of my pets.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.520]  That's the, it's either the default or it's the only way you get photos onto your Apple
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.000]  watch too is at least the default is that you've favorite them and then the favorites
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  are on the watch.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  Yeah.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.760]  And if you can also, is there a way that you can manually, um, specify a different album?
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.660]  You can specify a different album on the Apple watch, but it is albums only and favorites
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.400]  is the first option.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400]  Right.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]  The default.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400]  So out of the box, that's what, that's what happens.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  I'm looking at it right now.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  Sync album favorites.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.280]  Um, but anyway, long story short, I think it's really been a good year for photos and
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.960]  I am really intrigued to see where they go going forward because it's one of those things
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.120]  where I feel like it's the same thing as I trying to get everything across the board
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.440]  to go retina where you need all of these things in place first and some of that stuff you
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.640]  just have to wait for it.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.320]  And I feel like being able to say it doesn't matter, you know, like if you have a standalone,
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.960]  you know, camera and you then hook it up to your Mac and you import them into photos a
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.520]  week or two later, you forget what you took the photos of.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.780]  You just know you took a photo of, you know, your relatives' birthday party and the fact
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:21.600]  that it's just there on your phone, even if you didn't take the photos with your phone
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.600]  is great.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:29.040]  I'm really interested to see though, if, if what they do like for next year with photos
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:37.440]  is start beefing up, especially the Mac version to be more of a prosumer photo editing tool.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.680]  I'm hoping so.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.680]  I hope so too.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.880]  And my concern though, is that because everything is everywhere and that they're non-destructive
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.700]  that the Mac, what the Mac version of photos can do isn't limited by what the Mac can do,
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.720]  but it's limited by what iOS can do.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720]  Yeah.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.440]  Well, I mean, there's already, there's already some disparity there because the iPhone has
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.360]  of course, non-destructive third-party edits.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.000]  And the Mac did not get that option for app extensions until this fall.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.520]  And even then, those are limited to device.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.840]  So if you edit something on your iPhone, say with like the Pixelmator extension for iPhone,
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:21.660]  and then you import it, or you open it up in the Mac, you can't open it with the Pixelmator
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.400]  extension for Mac inside the Photos app.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.080]  You either have to, you can revert it so you can take off all of the edits or you can add
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.560]  a top of it, but you can't, once you've changed those sliders, if you open it up in the Mac
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:40.160]  and start to apply new more edits, you lose the previous ability.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.400]  But if you, but if you just look at it, you do see the edits that you did in Pixelmator.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.880]  Yes, you do.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.160]  So I guess that's one way to do it where, you know, the Mac could gain a lot of built-in
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160]  serious stuff.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.040]  And then when you open it up on the iPhone, you'd see them.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.240]  But then if you tried to edit it, it would warn you that you either need to make a copy
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.880]  of it or revert or something.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520]  I could live with that.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.840]  I, you know, and that's sort of, I think the best we can hope for.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.840]  Yeah.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.920]  I mean, I wouldn't necessarily rule out a pro version of photos, but I do think there's
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.240]  enough, there are enough things to make improvements to in the initial app where I think the initial
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.920]  app is a very solid 1.0 release.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.920]  But there are still, there are definitely, there are definitely tools that would be great
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.240]  for a prosumer app or a, you know, a consumer leading to like doing the slow stepping stones.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:35.880]  They've already done a great job, even with the editing menu, of making potentially, you
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:43.280]  know, severe and an expansive color correction available to somebody who doesn't really know
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.280]  much.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.160]  Where you just start with this slider from light to dark, and then you can drop it down
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.520]  and it becomes more expansive and more in depth.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.480]  And then you can add extensions if you really want to play around.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.920]  And oh, I've messed this up.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.080]  It's just a reset button away.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]  Yeah.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.680]  So a huge year for photos, in my opinion, Apple Music, the next thing, this is the part
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.560]  Apple Music to me, still, it confuses me.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.000]  You know, this is really the main reason I wanted you on the show is I want you to explain
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Apple Music to me.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  Okay.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.800]  Well, what do you what would you like to know about Apple Music?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.400]  How am I how am I supposed to use it?
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400]  Okay.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:27.080]  So do you do you want to use Apple's catalog of song?
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.840]  Like would you like to access Apple's catalog of artists?
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840]  I guess.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.000]  I think what I need to do.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Here's what I think I need to do.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.880]  I think for safety sake, I have backups, but I think I need to make like an entire copy
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880]  of my music library.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.040]  Yes, I think that's wise, which is largely ripped.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:50.440]  But I have had the match service for, you know, ever since it came out.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.680]  And make a copy.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:57.600]  And then I have all of my ripped stuff that I've had for, I don't know, 15 years now.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.440]  And then just go with Apple Music.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440]  Yeah.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.680]  So what I would suggest if you're starting from scratch, and you're you want to go into
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.180]  Apple Music, you make a copy of your library.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:13.360]  For that new copy of your library, if you want to start just absolutely clean, what
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.620]  you can do is create that new library.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:22.280]  And then I think there's a checkbox that allows you to add songs, but keep the linked locations
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280]  absolute.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.260]  So which is to say, like, if you have all of your songs packaged in your original iTunes
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.980]  music library, when you add them to the second library, it doesn't create a second copy of
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:34.980]  those songs.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:42.160]  It's just it's it has a provisional or I forget what that's called a symbiotic link from from
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.600]  the original library to your to your new library and alias basically,
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.940]  similar to to the way again, to compare it to photos similar to the way that when you
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:54.800]  imported your iPhoto library to the new photos, it didn't make copies of everything, correct
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.560]  to use symlinks to have what looks like two copies of it, but both phone pointing to the
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.640]  same stream of bytes on disk.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]  Exactly.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.240]  So you can you can fo do this.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.160]  And then once you have that second library, you turn Apple Music on for that library and
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.560]  your Apple ID, it's tied to your Apple ID.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.080]  That's the I think one of the most important things that people kind of overlook.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.780]  It's tied to your Apple ID, you turn on Apple Music.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:25.440]  And the big difference between having just Apple Music as your Apple Music service of
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:32.000]  choice, or having iTunes match or having both of them together, is that Apple Music alone
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.120]  gives you access to Apple's catalog, so you can stream any of their songs or their artists.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.160]  It lets you play songs that you yourself own, as well as the Apple Music catalog on any
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.300]  of your devices up to 10.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:54.140]  But when you or if you cancel that service, that streaming on extra devices thing goes
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.680]  away.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.560]  And all of those songs that you've streamed or downloaded to another device gets deleted
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:06.940]  whether or not you own them, extra auxiliary devices, and all of your Apple Music catalog
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.140]  goes away.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:13.560]  So you're left with just the original songs you had on your original computer.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.800]  The difference between that and iTunes match is that of course, an iTunes match, when you
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:25.400]  you're able to stream or download your songs that you own to any other computer that has
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.920]  your Apple ID.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.640]  But when you download those songs onto an auxiliary computer, those songs stay there
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:37.040]  forever, whether or not you cancel out iTunes match or not, they are they are forever on
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.760]  your auxiliary computer unless you delete them.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.940]  They are there, they are DRM free, they're awesome.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:49.560]  So if you just use Apple Music and you cancel iTunes match, then your collection, the songs
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.580]  you own that you stream or download to other computers will show up as Apple Music tagged
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.320]  if they can match to that catalog.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.660]  And if you cancel Apple Music, those songs on those auxiliary computers will disappear.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:08.880]  So if you want them to retain whether or not you choose to keep Apple Music, then that's
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.860]  when you keep the two subscriptions running concurrently.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:15.000]  So you have Apple Music and iTunes match.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Do you think it makes sense?
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Do you have both?
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Do you still have both?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.960]  I still have both in part because I'm testing a million things.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:29.080]  But no, I, I have both because I have a canonical music library on my iMac.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.400]  But I still I will download some things to other to other computers and I don't want
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.720]  my you know, the my local music library on an auxiliary computer to vanish if I decide
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.920]  to cancel Apple Music, because then I would have to go and re you know, re import everything
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.600]  onto an auxiliary computer or I'd have to re enable iTunes match and that seems like
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.620]  a, like work.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.640]  And it's like $25 to never have to worry about that work again.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.280]  Yeah, I can I can pay 25 bucks a year.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:03.220]  Yeah, 25 bucks a year is like underneath my I give a shit threshold, whereas the $14.99
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:08.320]  a month for the family plan of Apple Music is I want to make sure we're actually listening
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  to this.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  Yes, exactly.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.840]  It's like this is actually this is a bill this adds up to a significant amount of money
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  per month.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.360]  I like despite all of the insanity with Apple Music, and I really do think that the difference
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:26.600]  between the I the photos around the photos rollout and the music rollout is that music
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.000]  didn't have a beta period with people.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.880]  And if they had had a beta period with enough with a couple, you know, a couple hundred
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.640]  and like even 510,000 subscribers would be enough to hash out most of the terrible bugs
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.880]  they saw.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:48.400]  Like the fact that Apple Music or Apple Music and iTunes match users were seeing their songs
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.240]  matched as Apple Music that was a bug that was fixed within the first 48 hours.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.320]  But despite it being fixed in the first 48 hours, people went crazy over it for about
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.720]  a month and a half.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.000]  Yeah, that's a really keen observation.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.320]  I really think it's that, you know, that I photo or photos had a beta, and they worked
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.840]  out these kinks and music was like, all of you go sign up for this free service now for
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.320]  three months, and they worked out the kinks like on the fly, and it really did leave a
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.600]  sour taste in people's mouth.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.600]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.160]  And honestly, because it was free, they really could have just said, three free free or free
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.640]  three month trial.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.840]  And this is our beta period.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.760]  This summer is our beta launch off period for Apple Music.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.960]  That's what I mean, looking at Beats 1, I listened to Beats 1 a lot in the early days,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.720]  in parts because I was writing about it, but in part just because it was it was such a
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.160]  curiosity to me, as someone who hasn't listened to Terrestrial Radio in about 12 years, it
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.480]  was such a curiosity and such an interesting, like highbrow, can you make this work?
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.940]  But Beats 1 was very much in their initial two months, and even I mean, that interview
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:58.520]  with Zane Lowe that he gave recently at the BBC, or he was basically like, we are figuring
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.400]  this stuff out by the seat of our pants.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.120]  This is very much a beta for us.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:07.540]  And we won't know exactly what Beats 1 is or how it fits into the overarching theme
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.400]  of Apple Music for about a year, like we need this time to build it.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.600]  We built the station in 12 weeks, we need this beta period.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.000]  And so they like that side was very, very honest and straightforward, even on the air
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.960]  being like, we're just trying this out.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.560]  Let us know what you like, let us know what you don't, we can, you know, we want to work
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.200]  with you, we want to be your station.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.960]  And the rest of Apple Music was very like, this is how it is.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.680]  This is Apple Music, enjoy Apple Music.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.360]  How do you think it's going now that the for everybody who signed up right away, the three
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:47.120]  month beta, or not beta, but trial, yeah, reading your mind, the trial, the three month
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.400]  trial is over, and people got the notices like, hey, you're gonna get charged unless
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  you cancel.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.920]  How do you think they're doing now?
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.200]  It's hard to say, because I don't think they've announced anything.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.920]  No, and I don't think they will for a little bit.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.600]  I do think that probably 50 plus percent canceled.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.360]  But I don't actually think that's a bad thing.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.120]  I think that they need to do a little bit of retooling.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.120]  And they, I pretty sure kind of realized that they need to do a bit of retooling in terms
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.180]  of what's really valuable.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:17.300]  Their streaming catalog is fantastic.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:21.320]  You know, as someone who is still an Apple Music member, their streaming catalog is fantastic.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:28.900]  The 4U suggestions are very, very good, especially if you continue to listen and like these things
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:33.360]  and like and try and and try and refine your tastes.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.440]  Their curation engine is really pretty good.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.120]  And Beats 1 is really fun, despite not being a terrestrial radio person.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.760]  Like I will tune into that because it feels it almost feels like being in an office as
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:48.360]  a work at home person where it's like, oh, there are people occasionally talking, and
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.920]  they're talking about interesting music related things.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.520]  It's not like the daily local news in your area, and it's not something so depressing
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.580]  as NPR to get you kind of to get your stomach in knots.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:03.200]  It's just kind of light, fun, interesting content and good and good music you might
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200]  not have otherwise heard.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.360]  So I think there are quite a few people who are still kind of hanging on and have gotten
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.360]  addicted to certain aspects of the service.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.040]  But for the wide audience, Apple needs to put a little bit more work into it to really
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.440]  to really make it launch off.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.720]  And one of the I mean, one of the biggest things they can do is revamp iTunes on the
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:31.040]  Mac, because right now it's still a mess is the polite word.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.520]  I could say much, much more horrible things, but I will decline.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.940]  But, you know, the music app, the new music app and iOS 9, people are still complaining
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.100]  that it's messy.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.680]  But it's slightly it's less messy.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.780]  It's slowly like they're iterating on this and being like, okay, this is what works.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.160]  This is what doesn't.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:55.180]  It turns out, we don't need a more button that's going to last, you know, 15 links worth
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.860]  of more button.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.640]  We can we can work around this.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.680]  iTunes still feels gigantic and bloated and uncomfortable.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.060]  And it's just awkward in weird ways.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.840]  I think I told you this story over the weekend when you were here in Philly for the Coco
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]  Love.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]  Yeah.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.540]  And we hung out a little bit.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:18.000]  But long story short, my wife had a playlist, a new playlist she made on her Mac, and she
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.360]  just wanted to send it to her phone and go to the gym.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.820]  And the way the new iTunes works, it's like you there's like this weird dot, dot, dot
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820]  button.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.920]  And you select the playlist and then you go to the dot, dot, dot.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.000]  And then it just says send to device.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.680]  And then there's her iPhone and she'd click it.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.800]  And it which seems like that's what should do.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.280]  And then if you Google, you know, search for how you're supposed to do this, it says that's
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.480]  how it's supposed to do.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.920]  And it never just it just never showed up on her iPhone.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.640]  And long story short, I think that solution was to turn off Apple Music on all of our
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.260]  devices and just do it the old fashioned way and connect it to USB.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.360]  And then the dot, dot, dot send to this phone worked.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.960]  Yeah, because you're actually sending it over a tethered connection.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:02.960]  It's such a mess.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.960]  It's such a mess.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.760]  But if you have Apple Music turned on, it's like even having a tethered connection doesn't
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760]  make it work.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.240]  That's even worse sometimes like some of some of my playlists show up some of my playlists
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.200]  don't it's still this at this day.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.920]  It's like Apple, this is the that's the kind of stuff that could have been really valuable
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.920]  during a three month beta test of like, man, hey, there's some playlist problems.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920]  Let's actually find out.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.920]  And I find it really interesting.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:31.840]  I don't know if you saw this week, Apple launched an Apple Music help Twitter account, no office
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.840]  hours.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:33.840]  No.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.840]  Yeah.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.580]  So app at Apple Music help for people's Apple Music questions, and they have office hours
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:46.840]  from I think, eight to six, either GMT or ESTI, I need to actually look.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.040]  But I saw that and I quite literally laughed out loud.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.480]  Because that's, you know, that's what I have been doing for the last three months on and
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.200]  off is being people's like, Apple Music guru on Twitter.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.360]  And now I can be like, go talk to them.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.800]  They've actually built this thing.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.160]  Like I will happily help you stumble, like try and stumble through your problem with
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]  you.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:11.920]  But but maybe the people who have access to the engineers can fix your more high level
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.920]  problems, like the fact that pressing the like button refines your tastes.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.640]  But also, there's no way to save a song you like as a favorite without adding it to your
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640]  library.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:26.400]  And then it goes into the mass of like, the bottomless pit of library.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.400]  That's really awesome.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:33.080]  I yeah, the top pin tweet, in fact, answers my question is create a playlist with your
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.200]  favorite songs in Apple Music.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.200]  Huh?
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.200]  There you go.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.840]  Obviously, obviously, it's a frequently asked question.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:48.040]  Anyway, but isn't that that is sort of a fun, you know, again, not to really pretend like
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:54.720]  it's New Year's already, but and get all sanguine about and talk about 2015 in the past tense,
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:58.640]  but among other things that have happened this year, there's, you know, it has been
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:04.200]  a sort of
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.320]  quote unquote, new Apple, you know, things that Apple does that they wouldn't have done
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]  before.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:13.640]  And I think having a Twitter account with office hours is file that under things Apple
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.640]  wouldn't have done before.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:21.120]  Yeah, the new giving, given Steven Levy access to the the design team and actually having
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.960]  like, people's not only people's names associated to what they were doing, but people's faces
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.660]  and pictures inside.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.800]  It was just one of those things where I'm like, I would have never seen this story five
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]  or six years ago.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.600]  I'm really glad to see this story and hear more about the inner workings of Apple.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:41.320]  I'm really glad that Apple is reaching out for help and support beyond just the you know,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.400]  the standard disclaimer, go go see Apple care.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:48.720]  I'm glad that developers are getting more of a voice on Twitter without worrying that
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.720]  PR is good.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.840]  You know, the full wrath of PR is going to come and eat them alive and then they'll never
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.000]  be seen or heard from again.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.520]  It's it's a really interesting sea change.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.080]  And then you Sorry, go ahead.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.480]  Well, I one of the things a lot like, I would like to see it.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.440]  And I've been on this for years, I haven't talked about it frequently.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.000]  But years ago, I don't know, five or six years ago, I did a talk at Macworld back when Macworld
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.920]  San Francisco was still a thing.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.640]  It was like the my top 10 things to be, you know, things to look at, you know, for the
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:25.560]  future things to worry about Apple, you know, top 10 list, and one of them was that I wanted
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.200]  Apple to go back to having put letting letting the people who make the software put their
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.160]  credits in the about box.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.720]  Yeah, like, the whole reason about boxes were there, that that's a thing in Mac apps is
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:45.880]  originally it was so that the people who made the things could could get credit for them.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:51.980]  And it went away when Steve Jobs came back in 1997 98.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.920]  And now the about boxes are almost useless, and it's standard across all of their software
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.760]  where it just has the icon, the name of the app, the version number and a copyright.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.920]  And that's it.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.760]  It's almost like why do it, you know, why it's just the only thing you really get out
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.000]  of it is a version number.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.320]  And the idea that the jobs gave back in 98 was that Apple was in bad shape and their
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.540]  talent, they did it the one thing the company had the company was in bad shape, but it had
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:15.540]  lots and lots of talent.
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:20.640]  And he was really almost pleasantly surprised by the amount of talent engineering and in
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.280]  the fact that Johnny Ive and his team are already there didn't want them to be stolen.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.880]  Well, yeah, it was like an anti poaching thing.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.840]  But it's, that is such the way the world works today.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.160]  Nobody needs to nobody who's a recruiter trying to poach Apple employees needs the about box
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.400]  to figure out who wrote this app.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.520]  No, you know, and and there is obviously, I mean, if you, you know, I don't use LinkedIn,
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:48.600]  but I mean, thousands and thousands and thousands of Apple employees are on LinkedIn.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.840]  I mean, there's all sorts of, you know, and and, you know, I'm sure that the best recruiters
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.320]  don't even need to do that they have other they know it, right, like the difference between
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.200]  the current world today, and a world where Apple employees got to put their credits in
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.020]  the about boxes for the apps that are in the system.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:13.360]  The difference in the amount of talent that gets poached is I think, effectively zero.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.720]  Yeah, like, that's not a good reason to do it.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:22.000]  And I think that being able to sign your work, to me, it's, it's just an important part of,
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.160]  you know, it's just like a point of pride.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160]  Absolutely.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.840]  Well, it's also nice.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:33.780]  I mean, I you know, you know, Apple employees, I know Apple employees and former Apple employees.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:38.080]  And when you're working on something that's secret, all you can really say is I work in
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.960]  this team, and and you don't want them to say anything more because you don't want them
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.960]  to get in trouble.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.480]  But after a feature ships, you know, they can say like, Hey, I worked on that.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.360]  That was that thing in the keynote, that was partially my, you know, something that I did.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:58.480]  And I, I like that I like be again, like you said, I like the idea that our friends and
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.080]  and Apple, you know, people who work at Apple can sign their work and can be proud about
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:08.400]  their work, because they spend so long and under such levels of secrecy to get it right
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.220]  and get it perfect, and and just make a great product, whether that's hardware or software.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:18.200]  And when it comes out, like, I love what Tim Cook has been doing at the last couple events,
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.120]  which stand up if you worked on this, right, like, let's acknowledge these people and not
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.680]  have them hide in the shadows.
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.080]  Jobs did that too, sometimes.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.080]  But I don't know, I just feel like letting letting, you know, making the about box is
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.200]  relevant again, as just, you know, the credits, let it be the credits for the software.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200]  I don't know.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.600]  I feel like that kind of fits with the, the way that Steven Levy's behind the scenes of
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.720]  the new peripherals got to, you know, talk to people who actually designed them and worked
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.040]  on them and stuff like that.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:50.000]  Yeah, that's, it's very cool.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.720]  Let me take another break here and thank our next friendly sponsor.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.120]  And it is our good friends, longtime sponsors of the show mail route, R O, U, T, E, some
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.880]  people might pronounce that mail route.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.800]  I don't know, I say mail route.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:04.940]  Here's what they do.
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:10.000]  They are email nerds who do nothing but email.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.600]  That's and what they want to do is they want to handle your email.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:21.360]  They've created the first cloud based email filtering solution years ago, then they sold
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:30.960]  it to Microsoft, then the same team went back and they created a really clear product just
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:31.960]  as one thing.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:39.720]  It is an innovative and effective spam and virus filtering mail filter.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.720]  Here's how it works.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.000]  You have your own email server, your domain name, and you get your email.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.280]  You keep running your own email server, but what you do is you take your DNS records and
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:56.360]  you point the ones for email at mail route and then mail route, you point them at your
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.600]  regular mail service.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.460]  So mail route isn't actually hosting your email.
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:05.480]  It just goes through mail route first, then on to the email server you already have, works
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.480]  with any mail server.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.600]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:14.040]  All mail route does is filter out all of the crap, spam, the virus stuff.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.200]  I mean, Mac users don't really have to worry about the virus stuff, but spam is an enormous
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.440]  problem and mail routes spam filtering is, I would argue, second to none.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.400]  It is really, really amazing.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.600]  If spam filtering, for example, is the only reason that you use Gmail instead of hosting
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.760]  your own email, you should really take a look at mail route because it is super effective.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.320]  I mean, almost nothing gets through.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.800]  And they have really cool stuff, very configurable, so that you can get, for example, you could
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:49.160]  get a daily report just emailed to you at the end of the day with, here are the ones
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160]  that mail route was.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.800]  It's like maybe about 99% of spam.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.160]  They can just nuke and they're 100% certain that this is spam.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.160]  If there's anything that they are like, hmm, I think this is spam, but maybe not, you can
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.400]  get a report every day and then you see it and you say, wow, that wasn't spam.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.200]  Click it, you go there and mark it as not spam and it goes through to your email and
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.200]  then they'll remember that and it keeps going.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.620]  Really, really easy to set up.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:19.200]  The hardest part is probably just figuring out, going to where your domain is registered
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.400]  and getting the DNS records pointed the right way.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.200]  But they have all sorts of stuff to help you get that going.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  It's easy to set up.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.000]  It's reliable and it's trusted by really, really, there's large corporations, large
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.960]  universities, entire universities with tens of thousands of students and all the stuff
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.320]  goes through mail route first because they're so good at what they do.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.040]  Really is an amazing way.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.640]  It just returns email to like the old days when there was no such thing as spam.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.720]  They support all sorts of nerdy stuff too if you're like a sysadmin and these things
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.080]  mean anything to you.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.200]  They've got LDAP.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.320]  They've got Active Directory.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.400]  They support TLS.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.480]  They support mail bag, bagging, outbound relay, everything you would want from the people
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.600]  handling your email.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  It's so great.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  It's so simple, really great price.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.300]  It just takes all the junk out of your email and then you don't have to worry about spam
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.360]  anymore.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Very easy.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:24.480]  Go to mailroute.net because they're like a networking service, mailroute.net slash TTS
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.960]  for the talk show.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:33.040]  With that code, you will get a free trial and 10% off for the lifetime of your account.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:39.820]  Use that slash TTS URL and you save 10% for as long as you use them.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.360]  Could be decades to come.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.480]  My thanks to mail route.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.800]  Go check them out if you host your own email server.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:49.800]  What else do you want to talk about?
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.480]  Gosh, we could talk about the Facebook brouhaha Oh, that's a good one.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.840]  If you're talking about the same thing I'm thinking about, which is that we were talking
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.400]  about yesterday with Federico pointed this out.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.400]  Yes.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.400]  Do you want to summarize this?
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.400]  Yes.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.620]  So Facebook eats a lot of an iPhone's battery.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:13.600]  And it's traditionally eaten a lot of the iPhone's battery, which is why at least I
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.560]  more we recommend turning off background processes.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.880]  But in iOS nine, we were able to see not only is Facebook eating a lot of your battery,
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.240]  and you can see in terms of the battery screen and percentages, but you can now tell what
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.360]  specific processes Facebook is using.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.720]  And it turns out, even if you have background processing turned off, Facebook can still
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.840]  eat your battery with background audio.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:47.080]  And what Federico teaches theorized, and based on some very clever sleuthing on his part,
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:53.160]  is that Facebook is likely playing silent audio, to keep the app running and active
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.160]  in the background.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.640]  And I don't know if that that is helpful for them on the ad side, too, but it's insane
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]  to me.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.360]  Like what it's such a feel so dirty.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.760]  It's, it feels downright malicious.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  Yeah.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:11.760]  Honestly, the thing that occurs to me is it doesn't really matter what they're doing.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.000]  If if it's like they're, check out this tweet.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.720]  And this is a tweet from somebody I actually checked checked with this guy.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.520]  I don't know his real name is his Twitter account is just his first name, Chad.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:28.680]  But he tweeted a screenshot he added me and Jim Dalrymple and Phil Schiller.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.080]  And this is his his usage.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.640]  This is his usage from I guess that's an iPad, right?
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:39.480]  Yeah, that's an that's a an iPad mini.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:48.240]  His battery usage on iOS nine was 75% of his entire battery was consumed by Facebook, and
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.600]  it was only two minutes on screen.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.400]  This is so that the if you haven't looked at this, if you go to the usage and iOS nine,
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.660]  Apple's really gotten this to a very fine grained breakdown.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:06.400]  And the number one thing to remember is in most apps, the thing that kills your battery
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.320]  the most is making the display go.
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.080]  And so like knowing how much of your time so now that they tell you how much of the
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.480]  time was on screen and how much was in the background.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.000]  It can really tell you like, hey, maybe it's actually okay that tweet bot use 38% of my
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.720]  battery because wow, I was on it for three hours.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.120]  And yeah, you're like, All right.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.120]  All right.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.960]  Um, you know, and so for example, if you sit there and read a book in iBook for a long
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.200]  time, it makes sense that it's going to use a lot of battery even though that is obviously
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.580]  not a CPU intensive application because it's powering the screen.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:49.320]  This guy sent me this screenshot, Facebook, two minutes on screen, 15.9 hours in the background,
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:56.040]  it used up 75% of his iPads battery, and he has the Facebook can set not to be able to
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.920]  use background updates, which is insane.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.280]  That is insane.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:10.400]  And it actually to me, I honestly think it's, it shows who holds the who holds the power
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.360]  in the Facebook Apple really, if you think of Apple as this mighty corporation, and they
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:22.800]  think of the App Store is this powerful tool that they wield with their own utter discretion.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.840]  I actually think that this makes Apple look bad and weak.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.080]  It's it's almost like because Facebook is so essential to what people use their iPhones
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:37.080]  for, it's, you know, by almost every account, that single most used third party app on iPhone,
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.680]  that I almost wonder whether Apple knows that they're doing this and feels like they can't
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.680]  do it.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.400]  What are they going to do kick the Facebook app out of the App App Store?
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.100]  Well, unfortunately, it harms them.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.780]  I'm looking at my my battery for the last seven days on this.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.780]  This is crazy.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:54.640]  58 minutes on screen for Facebook 3.2 hours of background.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640]  There's no reason.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.480]  And do you have background updating turned off?
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.760]  I turned I have it turned off for Facebook.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.280]  So it's, you know, we should, this is mind boggling to me.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.280]  And it's, I don't know, I still don't have a Facebook account.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.440]  So I have not encountered this firsthand.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.720]  It does not inspire me to change after all these years to change my mind and maybe sign
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.720]  up for Facebook.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.720]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:17.720]  And I that's the sad thing.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.800]  It's like I was off Facebook around 2010.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.800]  I was done with it.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.960]  And I only went back because the people that I play roller derby with that is the roller
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.640]  derby community is on Facebook.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.800]  It's not a Twitter based place.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.560]  So I only use Facebook for for Derby and even so it ends up murdering my battery.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.200]  And I totally understand that.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:42.520]  And I know how much of stuff like that I was just at I don't we can talk about it a bit.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:47.240]  But I was at a screening of the Steve Jobs movie last night over at University of Pennsylvania.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.000]  And it was I thought it was like a press screening.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.280]  But it was really more for like, it was like students could get it was mostly just college
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280]  kids.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.240]  And they have like a it was like put together by like their, their film club or something
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:58.240]  like that.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.840]  And the pre announcement like, Hey, welcome, you know, glad everybody could be here.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.160]  It was like, how do you get involved?
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.040]  If you're a student, I want to get involved with the club.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.040]  It was Facebook.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.800]  Yeah, Facebook group, you know, I'm sure that there are 10 10,000 other examples of groups
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.360]  where if you want to get involved and stay in touch, it has to be Facebook.
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.880]  So I understand that.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.780]  And not everybody can be an antisocial hermit, like, but this is criminal.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:29.480]  This is absolutely insane that that they're working around, you know, people who are specifically
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:33.560]  saying I do not want you to update in the background, and they're doing it anyway by
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.560]  cheating.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.700]  I mean, if it doesn't matter whether the only way they're doing it is Federico's theory
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:45.760]  that they're playing silent audio, which lets them stay running in the background as a separate
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.680]  you know, thing from the background updating option, which clearly is not in the user's
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680]  interest, right?
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.160]  It's nobody wants that.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.300]  They've said we want you to shut up in the background, just stop.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:04.460]  And the other thing too, that struck me about this is this because of the insane popularity
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.560]  and of Facebook and how many people use it.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:11.020]  And clearly how detrimental it is to your battery.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:15.720]  This has to be I don't even think it's a maybe this has to be a main reason for the
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.720]  stress about the iPhone's battery like no, the fourth the force quitting apps thing.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:21.720]  Oh, that too.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:28.040]  Yeah, I would be surprised that this whole entrenched, what would you call it the way
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.560]  that so many people leaf it's a it's a tenant of like using a smartphone where Oh, I have
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.080]  to force quit my apps because it'll make the thing run faster and the battery last longer
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.880]  right on ATP.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.840]  The other week, Casey lists was saying he was at a football game and the guy in front
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.540]  of him every time he would take his phone out, he'd unlock it, do whatever he was going
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:50.800]  to do, and then double click the home button and force quit whatever app he just used and
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.040]  then turn the phone off and put it back in his pocket every single time he said and it
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.640]  was like driving him nuts.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.760]  But can you so in my thought was this is voodoo and Apple needs to stop this because it's
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.040]  not helping anybody.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:06.800]  Whereas it must be helping people because it that way you can actually nuke the Facebook
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.560]  app and it wouldn't be playing the silent audio anymore and you actually would see better
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.560]  battery life.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.480]  Yeah, I mean, I use so I used to use the force quit apps technique way back when when I would
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:22.200]  go over the border between us and Canada so that I wouldn't accidentally use data usage
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:27.260]  because that you know that like that is the way to ensure that someone's not leeching
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.260]  in the background.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.640]  So you'd cut everything on that.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:35.120]  But yeah, I mean, it seems like that's the only way to ensure that Facebook's not leeching
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.200]  leeching data and looks at not even battery life data.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.640]  Like you think about how much how much data?
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.560]  I don't care if the audio is silent, you're still streaming something.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.720]  You are still requiring a call and it'd be really interesting to compare this with also
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:51.760]  the numbers of the cellular data.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:58.200]  But I but I do think you're absolutely right and that that it it emphasizes and it it validates
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:04.160]  the force quit theory where Oh, well, of course, this is how I have to use my iPhone.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.880]  And I also I think that it might actively be skewing iPhone battery numbers enough use
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.300]  Facebook that I wouldn't be surprised if that's cutting half an hour an hour off of your battery
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:15.300]  every day.
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:18.820]  And if you're going from you know, you think you're getting a phone with a 14 hour battery
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:23.080]  and you end up getting, you know, closer to 11 or 12.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:29.880]  That's I mean that that it's a bigger problem than I think we've made it out to be before
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:30.880]  this.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.880]  Yeah, I really was not aware of it.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:36.580]  But it's it really seems like I don't use the word lightly, but it seems scandalous.
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:37.580]  It really does.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:38.580]  Yeah.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:42.440]  It's literally dark matter to most people like they're not going to figure this out
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.680]  like just going to settings general.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:51.640]  Yeah, setting settings battery to find the usage now, right?
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:55.520]  Oh, right, right, right settings battery, but people, you know, how many people go there?
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:57.280]  I don't think it's a lot.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.320]  You stumble across it occasionally, you're like, Oh, that's fun.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.320]  Yeah.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.080]  The only the only app that has more I'm looking at cellular data right now, the only app that
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.880]  has more than Facebook right now and Facebook has 420 something megabytes, they've got they've
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:20.000]  got the music at 430 and tweetbot at 551 megabytes, but I use those apps probably 15 times as
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.880]  much as Facebook on my phone.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.880]  That's crazy.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:31.720]  Yeah, I'm looking at Yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:35.480]  Anyway, I think that it's this is not the last we've heard of this.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:40.900]  I think that this story has legs in politics.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:41.900]  But it's just crazy.
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:46.080]  Like this guy with the two minutes on screen and 15 hours at the background is crazy.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.080]  Yeah.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:51.280]  And the and the usage the fact that you know, it's not it's not just 75% but only he he's
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.560]  only used it two hours like you he has the time since last full charge there.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.080]  And that's the really like,
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:02.080]  yeah, and if you it's, you have to tap it if you're just looking at it, if you'd look
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:07.000]  at the iOS nine, if you tap it, and you get this little there's a little blue clock thing
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.560]  that shows you the the
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.440]  how long on screen and how long in the background breakdown doesn't show that by default.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.800]  Yeah, for me, it's tweetbot and and Safari.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.000]  Yeah, tweet tweet, but the last 24 hours have been maps because I've been using my phone
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  a lot.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.240]  But tweetbot Safari maps music Facebook.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.240]  Right.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:32.040]  And then mail is the only one to me that has the big difference between on screen and background
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.360]  because I don't Yeah, you know, but that makes sense.
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.760]  Because I have mail set to to download my mail in the background.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:38.760]  Exactly.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.260]  Like mail has a good reason to download stuff in the background.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.440]  And I know how to shut it off.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:46.660]  And if I told it not to if I said, you know, which I do it again, which I do when I go
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:50.680]  to a foreign country, and I'm on like 100 megabytes SIM card, and I'll just have my
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:51.680]  email set.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:54.880]  Don't Don't load email until I, you know,
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.440]  until I asked for it.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.440]  Yeah, fetching.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.440]  And then it does.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.800]  It does that.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:00.800]  It's it.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.800]  This is it.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.900]  Again, it's so easy for someone like me who who's never used Facebook and has always been
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:10.280]  sort of skeptical of the company to sit here and and complain about it.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.280]  But this proves my point.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.520]  Yeah, this really does seem scandalous.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.240]  I mean, this seems it's almost outrageous.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:19.880]  Well, yeah, I mean, I look at the look at the battery and I'm like maps, you can have
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.080]  background activity that makes sense.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.840]  Well, you can have background activity music, you can have background activity podcasts.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.840]  Yes.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.520]  All of these make sense.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:29.520]  Facebook having background.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:33.280]  I don't know what Facebook would do with background activity, like actively be useful for me,
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.600]  maybe load more of my timeline so I can read it when I don't have a data connection, but
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.400]  I don't care.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:42.440]  It would be curious to see what they are doing and why they're doing it.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.440]  But yes, you know, I don't know.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.440]  It's really, really interesting.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:47.440]  Yeah.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440]  I agreed.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:54.160]  I don't think we've heard the last of it, but you know, get, get, get, get, get your
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.160]  pitchforks out.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160]  Seriously.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.680]  Let's say yeah, let's enact change on this.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.680]  Let's let's cut this.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.680]  Steve Jobs movie.
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.680]  Do you want to talk?
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.680]  Yeah, let me just do one.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:06.600]  I have one last sponsor to thank and then I will tell you about the what I thought of
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.600]  the Steve Jobs movie.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:08.600]  Please do.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:14.040]  And we just we should also talk about Elon Musk, which is a good segue.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:19.920]  So our last sponsor, good friends, longtime sponsors of the show is harvest.
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:25.400]  Harvest is a beautiful business tool for tracking time spent on client projects.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:31.000]  With harvest, you can start a timer from anywhere, either your web browser, desktop, mobile device,
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.160]  no matter where you find yourself working, the focus stays on the task at hand.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:41.040]  You can track hours, they appeal, they appear in a visual time report that is designed to
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.600]  keep your projects on time and within budget.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.240]  And you can use the reporting features.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.880]  After you've used it for a little bit, you use the reporting features and they show you
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.680]  which clients and projects are making you the most money, which ones are making the
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:59.720]  less money or which ones might be costing you money because the time you're putting
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.680]  into it is just not commensurate with what you're getting paid for it.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:05.480]  Really, really interesting.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.980]  These reporting features, it's not just like a stopwatch that you get and gives you the
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.160]  time you spend on a project.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:16.040]  The way they integrate these into reports and let you combine it with what you're getting
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.640]  paid and stuff like that can really help you figure out whether you're putting your time
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:24.880]  into the right clients and projects and stuff like that.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:31.360]  And the fact that they have clients for everything, mobile apps, the website, doesn't matter where
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.780]  you are, whether you're at your desktop on a big iMac or whether you're on your MacBook
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:41.040]  or whether you're on your phone or whatever, it all is just tied into the exact same Harvest
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.040]  account.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.400]  And you don't really have to think about it.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.000]  It just all just it's just there when you need it.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.520]  And it really is super convenient to have to do to be able to do it that way, as opposed
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.560]  to something that is, say, only on your Mac.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.320]  And then you've got to keep track of your time spent doing things away from your Mac
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.700]  for the project some other way and then get back and log it in.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:01.700]  Forget it.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.960]  You don't have to do that with Harvest.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.680]  They also handle invoices, gives you the billable hours right there.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.200]  So you don't have to use a different tool when you want to get paid.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.900]  You don't have to use a different tool to send the invoices out.
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:18.000]  You can send them right out from Harvest.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.760]  So where do you go to get started?
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.760]  Easy.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.900]  Their website is getharvest.com.
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:30.160]  And you get a free 30-day trial, long trial.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:35.720]  But when you're done, when the 30-day free trial is up, use this code, the talk show
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.140]  at the checkout.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.140]  And get this.
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:39.140]  Here's what you save.
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:45.400]  You save 50 percent off your first month with that code, half off with the talk show as
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.400]  your code.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.520]  So if you do any kind of freelance work, if you run any kind of client services thing,
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:51.800]  go check them out.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.520]  Harvest is almost certainly a better way to keep track of your time than what you're doing
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:58.080]  now.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.000]  So before I talk about the movie, let's talk about Elon Musk.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.800]  There was a thing last week where he waswho was he interviewed with?
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.540]  It was a German newspaper.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:16.520]  And they asked him about Apple hiring, rumors and reports that Apple is hiring Tesla engineers.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.720]  And here's what he said.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.740]  Elon Musk said, they have hired people we've fired.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:25.720]  We always jokingly call Apple the Tesla graveyard.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:28.200]  If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.160]  I'm not kidding.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:36.240]  Oh, Elon Musk ishe speaks his mind.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.240]  That is what I will say.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:42.560]  I mean, he's very, very Jobsian and very much like plenty of other folks we know in this
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.080]  area.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.100]  I don't think he necessarily meant it the way that it came out.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:51.320]  I think that he was probably making a comment about Apple's car efforts and not about Apple's
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.280]  engineering talent.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.920]  But it's still pretty, pretty bad.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:01.840]  It is and it's Jobsian in my opinion.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:02.840]  Yes, it is.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.400]  It is a Jobsian thing to say, which is whether it's true or not.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.520]  And that to me is an interestingthat's the interesting thing because it could be
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:16.200]  that they've done internally, they've looked at this and they've decided that a lot of
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:22.200]  the people that engineering talent that Apple's hired away from Tesla were not the A players
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:26.180]  that Apple is getting the B players and the A players are sticking at Tesla.
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:30.500]  That could be true and he's willing to just come out and say it.
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:33.160]  Or it could not be true.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:36.440]  It could be that Apple's hired great people from Tesla but he's just saying it anyway
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.840]  because he's Elon Musk.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  Because it's Elon Musk.
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:40.840]  Right.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.760]  And either way, it works.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.920]  I like it.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:49.040]  I think that it's funny and I think that it's very confident.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:53.040]  And the thing that people have compared it toand it jumped to my mind immediately
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:59:00.640]  right away toowell, the next thing he said was that building a car is the next logical
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.440]  thing for them to do.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.200]  But then he said, did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.280]  No, seriously, it's good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction but cars are
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:15.960]  very complex compared to phones or smartphones.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.920]  And I think he said thatI don't have it here in this article.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:21.640]  See, the weird thing is that the German original one is like behind a paywall.
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:25.640]  And then he said something to the effect of that you can't just goyou can just go
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:29.920]  to China and tell Foxconn to build you a watch but you can't just go to Foxconn and say
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.400]  build me a car.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:39.640]  And the comparison that that brings to mind is then Palm CEO Ed Colligan back in December
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:43.600]  of 2006, which was like a month before Apple unveiled the iPhone.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.960]  And nobody knew what it was going to look like but rumors were rampant that Apple was
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.920]  going to do a phone and he said something to the effect of we've been working on this
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:52.920]  for a long time.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:57.280]  PC guys aren't going to just jump in and figure it out.
[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:04.680]  And the PC guys at Apple just jumped indid just jump in and figure it out.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:13.840]  The difference that I see between Ed Colligan then and Elon Musk now is that Palm in 2006
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:15.540]  was totally stagnant.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.720]  They were not making things that were amazing.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:20.120]  They were not future-focused at all.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:21.120]  Right.
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:26.040]  They werethey seemed like they were behind.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.400]  Here's the quote from him in 2006.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:28.400]  I've looked it up.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.800]  We've learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.400]  PC guys are not going to just figure this out.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.640]  They're not going to just walk in.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.360]  So the Elon Musk quote does seem toit has echoes of that.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.860]  But the Palm products of 2006 sucked.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:44.860]  They were terrible.
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:45.860]  They were behind the times.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:47.040]  They just were not exciting.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:49.320]  Whereas Tesla is doing great work.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:53.000]  They literally made the Motor Trend Car of the Year.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  Phenomenal work.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.080]  And the Model X is not for me, but even just listening to the stuff that they were talking
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.000]  about in the Model X, I'm like, that is a phenomenal car.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.160]  That is a really cool car.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.160]  Right.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.200]  So I actuallyI love it.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:08.080]  I love that he's embracing this flat out.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.700]  He's brash.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:12.320]  And I think it is great for both companies.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:17.560]  I wroteyears ago I had a piece that Apple needs a Nikon.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.160]  That Canon makes better cameras because they have an arch rival for decades in Nikon who
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:29.560]  makes cameras that are as good or better, glass that's as good or better in some ways.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.700]  That the competition keeps both companies better.
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:40.360]  That comparison is maybe not that good anymore because both Canon and Nikon are sort of getting
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:46.400]  disrupted by these mirrorless cameras like the ones from Sony, but don't take the analogy
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.400]  too far.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.360]  But anyway, I just think it would be great.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:59.040]  It would be so great if Tesla keeps kicking ass in between now and even the optimistic,
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:00.040]  you know.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.040]  2020, 2019.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.040]  Yeah.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.200]  2019 is supposedly the goal.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.240]  So let'sif the watch shipped a year late, let's guess that the car will ship at least
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.240]  a year or two late.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.280]  We're probably looking at 2020 or 2021.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:21.080]  Nothing could be better for Apple than for Tesla to keep kicking ass and have a great
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:26.640]  five-year run from now until then just to keep the state of the art going forward.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.600]  Yeah, I honestly hope they do.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:36.380]  I feel like Elon Musk, again, is one of these people that doesn't come around every spring.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.760]  He is a unique snowflake in a number of ways.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:45.040]  And to have him basically breathing down Apple's neck, not even in a mean way, even if he just
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:51.800]  continues to make jabs and jokes and his engineers continue to make fantastic stuff, that's going
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.160]  to spur Apple to work that much harder.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:02.240]  Innovation my ass is a great grumpy, grumpy, we hate the fact that everybody's been complaining
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.040]  about us not innovating when clearly we're innovating.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:10.440]  But that kind of stuff, I really think that does drive them in a little bit.
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:13.840]  Apple is very proud of the work that they do and the products that they make and to
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:20.800]  have somebody even in jest saying, yeah, Apple's not going to figure out ayou bet the Project
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.760]  Titan team is like, oh, yeah, Elon Musk, okay, we'll show you.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:26.760]  It's good.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.280]  Competition is good and especially intelligent competition, not like we're going to copy
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.160]  your features and then you're going to copy ours and then vice versa.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  That's boring.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.160]  Right.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.800]  It's so different coming from the founder of
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.040]  How many different companies now?
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.760]  Well, but the mostlet's just talk cars.
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:48.160]  Let's not even talk rocket ships.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:55.840]  But just talking cars, it's awesome that to hear sort of straight up, you know, competitive
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:58.800]  talk from the leader of the most innovative.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.560]  I don't see how anybody could deny me.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.160]  I don't know that they're the best cars in the world and I know that they're still
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.400]  very expensive.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.080]  But in terms of how innovative the cars are, I don't see how anybody could deny that
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.920]  Tesla is the most innovative company, even just the way that they sell the cars without
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.080]  having dealers and selling directinnovative.
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.740]  To have him take Apple on is just great.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:25.620]  The only thing I didn't like is that the next day, he kind of walked it back a little
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.600]  bit and he did this by Twitter.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.580]  So his comments were instantlythey're all over the place.
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:35.080]  Probably everybody listening to this show saw something about him.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.420]  But then the next day, he tweetedI'll just go back.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:42.880]  The other quote he told this German newspaper was, no, seriously, it's good that Apple
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.900]  is moving and investing in this direction.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:49.320]  But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches.
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:54.740]  And again, that's so Steve Jobsian in my opinion because he's not going to make phones
[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:56.160]  or smartwatches.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:02.820]  And so it's such a neat rhetorical trick to just sort of sayto pin Apple as a company
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:06.760]  that makes these things that are easy, which are not easy.
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:09.480]  There's nothing easy about phones or smartwatches at all.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.480]  It's not true.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:15.240]  I'm not saying that cars aren't complex.
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.600]  They're just complex in different ways.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:17.600]  It's a different industry.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.320]  It's a completely different industry.
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:27.480]  You've got multi-gigahertz Unix machines with touchscreens with 60 frames per second animation
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:31.080]  that we carry in our pockets all day, right?
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:33.080]  I mean, they are amazing devices.
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:38.940]  So don't tell me that cars are another order of magnitude or something like that.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:39.940]  But it's funny.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:43.680]  Anyway, on Twitter, he tweeted, yo, I don't hate Apple.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.520]  It's a great company with a lot of talented people.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:51.240]  I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV, electronic vehicle.
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:55.260]  Regarding the watch, Johnny and his team created a beautiful design, but the functionality
[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.480]  isn't compelling yet.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.200]  By version three, it will be.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:04.960]  So as somebody who started following Elon Musk, I think I started following him during
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:09.680]  the initial Dragon tests where they're trying to land a rocket upright.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:14.400]  And just because some people were retweeting stuff, he had tweeted and I'm like, huh,
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:18.400]  a CEO that speaks frankly on Twitter and that's not John Lugary, this will be interesting
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.200]  to watch.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:25.340]  He tends to do this pretty like do the day after responsive tweets to pretty much every
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.500]  interview he's done.
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:31.520]  He did it after the, yeah, let's drop nukes on the polls comment to that that happened
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.660]  during the Stephen Colbert, where I think he just he says things and then he watches
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:42.680]  the media be like, oh, no, no, you're you're misinterpreting what I said completely, OK.
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.420]  Just just for my own personal like happiness meter, I'm going to say this, and I don't
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:51.720]  necessarily think it's it's apologizing.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:56.320]  I think it's let me actually make sure you understand what I said.
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:57.320]  You peons.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:58.320]  Right.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:02.840]  Like it's dialing it back a little, you know, like he's he's going to make he he'll come
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:03.840]  out though.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.800]  And it's why he's such an enjoyable personality.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:13.880]  And I can't help but think that having a personality like that is really helps motivate teams and
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:19.240]  the companies that he works for in the same way that it did with jobs by erring on the
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:26.080]  side of having the dial turn too high it and then and then dialing it back as necessary,
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:30.280]  as opposed to being cautious and keeping the dial a little too low and then maybe trying
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:31.360]  to tweak it up a little bit.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.640]  You know, you have to pick which side you're going to err on.
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:34.640]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.880]  Too much or too little.
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:37.320]  By erring on the side of too much.
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:40.720]  I think it's it's how you do the impossible.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.360]  Yeah, I absolutely.
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:47.200]  I mean, you can't you can't win big unless you attempt to fail big and you can't.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.980]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:52.960]  I'm happy with him being boisterous and ridiculous.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.400]  It did it.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:55.400]  I thought it was fun.
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:56.400]  It did, though.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:00.840]  It made me and again, just by coincidence, the timing is this.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:05.320]  This part is truly coincidental is just that the fact that Steve the anniversary of Steve
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:11.520]  Jobs's death was last week, four years, you know, every October it comes up and it hits
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:12.520]  a little bit.
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:15.880]  And it just made me think and in some ways it's just sad and it just, you know, nobody
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.880]  wanted a guy to die.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:20.680]  So it's always sad to remember somebody, you know, beloved who died.
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:28.280]  But with the Elon Musk comments, it really made me miss him because it's Apple doesn't
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.400]  need somebody who can play that role.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.480]  But you know, I mean, it would have been Steve back and forth.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:40.680]  Yeah, the back and forth between Steve Jobs and Elon Musk on a semi public forum would
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:42.160]  have been glorious.
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.000]  And going forward, making cars, right?
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.440]  Oh my gosh.
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.240]  Like as fun as it's going to be to have Apple and Tesla competing in this space, it would
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:54.440]  have been more fun if if it was Elon Musk and Steve Jobs.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440]  Yeah.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.640]  So I may admit did make me miss him a little bit.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:08:59.640]  Yeah.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.360]  But anyway, last thing I did see the the Steve Jobs movie.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.640]  Yeah, everybody's calling Aaron Sorkin.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.160]  But it's Aaron Sorkin written and Danny Boyle directed.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.240]  I can see why the Aaron Sorkin I you know, what all has Aaron Sorkin done?
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:19.580]  Yeah, he's done a few good men.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:24.480]  He's done the West Wing Sports Night, which is still one of my all time favorite TV shows.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:27.320]  Studio 60, which was not one of my all time favorite TV shows.
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:28.320]  I like that.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.720]  I like Oh, I like it.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:32.840]  It was flawed, but had some really great moments.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:33.840]  And same thing with the newsroom.
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:39.600]  And then very, very flawed, but occasional high points and then occasional hyper low
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:40.600]  points.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:43.600]  So he has a style of dialogue.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:49.920]  And it is you either like it, hate it or or maybe sometimes you like it and sometimes
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:50.920]  you don't.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.360]  But it's very distinctive.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.360]  And this movie is very, very Aaron Sorkin.
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:59.820]  He also wrote the the social network movie.
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:07.560]  And the social network to me was a far more conventional movie.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.960]  It was you could tell this Sorkin isms in the way that characters talked, but
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:14.520]  it was very neutered for for Sorkin.
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:18.640]  Like that was the first thing I ever noticed with with social network is it feels very
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.900]  again, there's little bits of Sorkin in it, but it doesn't feel like an Aaron Sorkin production.
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:28.340]  This the Steve Jobs is very it just screams Aaron Sorkin.
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:31.520]  And in ways that are good and bad and the way that's good.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.880]  The best thing I can say about it is that there's only a handful of major characters
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:42.280]  and they are all interesting.
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.760]  And well, with the exception maybe of Chris and whatever her last name was the Yeah, the
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:55.640]  mother of Lisa, his first child, who was sort of a sort of weird in the movie.
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.880]  And just a little, little mousy.
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.740]  But she was what she was.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.200]  She just didn't have as much dialogue.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:06.320]  And it made her a little uncertain issue.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:12.000]  But the characters who were there were all vivid, very, very vivid.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.800]  It was not just Steve Jobs and a bunch of others.
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.920]  It was, you know, a bunch of very interesting characters.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.360]  And the dialogue is good.
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.520]  And the characters are coming from interesting perspectives.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:27.440]  And there's a lot of really, really interesting conflict.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:31.800]  And it's entirely verbal.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:33.440]  It I enjoyed it.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.080]  I thought the last third drug a little bit.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.080]  It's bait.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:39.500]  And I think most people know the basic gist of it.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.160]  It's three acts the first there.
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:47.800]  And there are all these scenes that centered around Apple or Steve Jobs, product and failings
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:55.760]  1984 is original Macintosh 1988 next box, and 1998 original iMac, which we just talked
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:58.120]  about an hour ago.
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.660]  And then there's this these scenes of, you know, personal conflict around these events,
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.300]  but it's not really about the events.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:07.220]  And it's not about the products.
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:09.880]  For the most part.
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:14.200]  I thought the third one, the third act with the iMac it the scene, drug a little bit.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:17.220]  I like the first two much better.
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.360]  This movie is wonder is really good.
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.940]  Here's the other thing I have to say is because I know there's a lot of people out there listen
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:22.940]  to the talk show.
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:27.200]  This movie is really, really going to bother you if you're the sort of person who wants
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.240]  it to be factually accurate.
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:34.960]  I don't understand why you'd go see a fiction movie, you expect it to be fair.
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.800]  I know why people expect it to, to hit all of the buttons.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:42.680]  But it was already based on a book that wasn't intact.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:43.680]  You know?
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.860]  Yeah, but this takes liberties, though, it just isn't just taking liberties.
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.840]  This is like, the best way I can say is it.
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:56.900]  It feels a lot more like a play than a movie.
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:13:01.280]  And in fact, I think it could be adapted to be a stage play really good.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.640]  Yeah, really easily.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:07.720]  I think the hardest part would be how to stage it because so much of it takes place on stages,
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:08.720]  like empty rooms.
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.520]  Like, I almost feel like the I was thinking about it as I when I came home is like maybe
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:17.220]  the way to play it would be to have the actors pretend that the theater they're performing
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:24.100]  the play in is empty, and that the audience isn't there.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:26.440]  But that's the way it feels to me.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:27.740]  It didn't really feel like a movie.
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:31.980]  And it's not certainly not a biography in any sense of the word, like, thinking about
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:39.920]  like, I saw somebody on Twitter who tweeted that he that he wished that Martin Scorsese
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.520]  would do a Steve Jobs biography, sort of like The Aviator.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:44.640]  Oh, God, I would be so bored.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.780]  Like, I mean, Steve Jobs is a fascinating character, but I just I don't feel like we
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.780]  need it.
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:51.820]  I don't think we need a dialogue.
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:57.480]  Nothing that he did was as cinema, cinema, cinematically interesting as flying experimental
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.480]  airplanes.
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:13:59.480]  It's true.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:00.480]  It's true.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:10.120]  I don't know if it's Scorsese, but yeah, it was Abdel Ibrahim, whose Twitter account is
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:16.840]  ABDO photo, who tweeted that, which I thought was a keen observation.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:19.840]  If that's what you're hoping for, it is not like that at all.
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:27.760]  And it is not a story like the, you know, that, like, the social network was, it's,
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:35.520]  you know, a melodrama about his personal life and with the with the Lisa, his daughter.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:42.480]  Overall, I don't know, I kind of I enjoyed it, but I really had to let go of what I know
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.480]  to be factually true to enjoy it.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.680]  And I can really see I also can really see why his family is not happy about it at all.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.960]  Because some of the like liberties, they're not just liberties, they're just total inaccuracies.
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.960]  So just to name one, and it really the movie really centers around his relationship with
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.760]  his first daughter, Lisa, and the way that when she was first born, he denied his paternity.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.760]  That's all factually true.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:06.600]  We don't we know that.
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:11.320]  And it and complaining about this is the knee jerk response I get when I bring this stuff
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:16.640]  up is that people think that if you're people like me, who is a fan of Steve Jobs, want
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.060]  this stuff buried, and we don't want to talk about it.
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:23.840]  We don't want it to be out there because it's uncomfortable and it's it's ugly.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:24.880]  It's unfortunate.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:25.880]  That's not the case at all.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:30.000]  And nobody who I know who really cares about it is is saying those things and and the way
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.040]  that he could be almost tyrannical to work for.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:39.180]  Nobody is asking people not to remember that or to sweep it under the carpet.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.680]  They're just asking for it to be put in a context.
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:44.160]  And the thing that to me I could see would be so painful.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.120]  It's it's is in the movie.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:53.640]  He in 1998, when it this iMac thing, he still hasn't reconciled with his daughter, Lisa,
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:16:00.600]  and then he sort of does right before he goes on stage to unveil the iMac, which is ridiculous
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.600]  if you think about it.
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:02.840]  Why in the world would he be doing that?
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.800]  Like as like the PR people are saying, like, you know, you're 30 seconds late, you're a
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.000]  minute late, you know, you're, you know, did not happen.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  It doesn't seem like Jobs at all besides if you were if you're talking about, you know,
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.900]  someone who is obsessively focused over right rehearsing and all of that, you know, right.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:23.920]  No one gets to come near me for 24 hours, right?
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:26.540]  And actually, yeah, that's his ways.
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:29.960]  And the character that Michael Fassbender plays is interesting.
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:30.960]  And he's great.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.960]  He's what he is a great actor.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.040]  And it's a very interesting character.
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.240]  But the character he plays bears no resemblance to Steve Jobs.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:42.400]  Yeah, it's so in short, what I almost wish is is I almost wish that they had done like,
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:46.020]  like something like citizen kid, this wouldn't have sold because it's the name Steve Jobs
[02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:48.600]  that is selling tickets to the thing.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:54.820]  But like citizen Kane was a thinly veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst.
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.820]  Yeah.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:00.640]  And instead of naming the guy, William Randolph Hearst, I mean, they had enough legal problems
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.320]  dealing with Hearst as is like Hearst almost got the negative burned.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:05.320]  Yeah.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.160]  By naming the guy.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.160]  What's his name?
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.680]  Charles Foster Charles Foster Kane.
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.680]  So funny.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:17.320]  I remember the foster but Charles I was gonna say George Foster Kane, Charles Foster Kane.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.720]  They had enough problems as is but it in addition to the fact that it helped them legally, it
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.840]  just let them take liberties that they couldn't take otherwise.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:35.880]  But in real life, Steve Jobs was married to, you know, Lorraine Powell jobs by this time
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:36.880]  in the early 90s.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.520]  And they had kids of their own.
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:44.560]  And that family reconciled with Lisa at some point in the 90s and brought her in and she
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:46.520]  was living with them for a time.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:53.320]  And, you know, whatever damage was done early in Lisa's life had gotten a lot better.
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:57.760]  And Steve Jobs had really turned around well before 1998.
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:04.840]  Whereas this movie paints a portrait of somebody who bears no resemblance to reality at all.
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:07.580]  And I just can't imagine, right.
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:12.560]  And then just the little factual things that are going to drive nerds crazy is that like
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:21.080]  in 1998, Steve was Wozniak was was still bugging Jobs to thank the Apple to engineering team
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:24.360]  at the at the iMac introduction.
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:35.600]  And what, and I swear to God and and Jobs blames was for the Newton what I'm not making
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:36.600]  this up.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:43.440]  So if things like that would bother you, like, like you like, would would there's no way
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:48.920]  that you can get around them and just pretend that this is a totally fictional fable loosely
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:51.840]  based on somebody named Steve Jobs and Apple.
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:53.340]  Do not see this movie.
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:19:00.080]  If you if you don't want to see Steve Jobs blame Wozniak for the Newton, then do not
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.720]  watch this movie.
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:08.100]  You know, so Sverker has written a couple of plays, and one one of them I saw pretty
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:13.000]  recently called the Farnsworth invention, which is a story about the founding of television
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  essentially.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  Oh, right.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  Right.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.200]  It's it's a very, very good show.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.760]  If you know nothing about the founding of television, which is to say it, it centers
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:28.040]  around a guy named Philo Farnsworth, and then RCA, who is basically Farnsworth and RCA were
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:32.880]  simultaneously developing television, and then it deals with basically their legal battles
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.680]  where Farnsworth alleges that RCA basically steals the founding of television.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:43.440]  All of that is true, the height or like the the pivotal point in the script, which is
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:51.040]  how the legal battle results is wildly different from the actual results of of the world's
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.600]  like what actually happened in real life.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:59.020]  And a lot of people when they first saw the saw the show were just kind of like, uh, what?
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:03.240]  But Sorkin went that way because he wanted to make his point, like he wanted he was telling
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.460]  a story.
[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:12.600]  And whether or not the story actually lined up with real logistical history, doesn't matter.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:19.280]  It's theater, which is very much what I kind of feel like, even from the earliest trailers
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:24.680]  of Steve Jobs, again, I really I wish it hadn't been called that I wish they had figured out
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:25.680]  a different title.
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:28.300]  I wish that they had taken more liberties with it.
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:34.880]  Because I think a Charles Foster Kane, like a Citizen Kane version of Steve Jobs's life
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.880]  would be fascinating, just like a Steve like a Citizen Kane version of Elon Musk's life
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:43.120]  would be fascinating.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:48.120]  And it's not it again, because it's just these three little scenes, you know, surrounding
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:52.520]  these product inventions, it wouldn't have this movie wouldn't even with with giving
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:58.060]  everybody fake names wouldn't have the scope of a Citizen Kane, not like the epic scope,
[02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:03.800]  but that sort of, I don't know, or just wait a few decades, you know, literally decades
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:07.120]  so that it's not it's not so fresh, right?
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:12.160]  I mean, the iMac, you know, I remember the iMac launch, I'm sure you do, too.
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:17.100]  It really wasn't that long ago, not even 20 years back.
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:22.480]  It's a I don't know, if all the people are still like, if two thirds of the people pictured
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:27.000]  in this film are still living, you have I mean, Moneyball was the same was the same
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  issue, right?
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  I don't I actually don't know the logistics.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.320]  Like I read the book, right?
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:36.080]  But the book and the film are a little bit different in my ways, but I don't even Yeah,
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.080]  I don't know.
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:38.080]  It feels it feels weird.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.320]  I don't like watching biopics, especially recent biopics for that very reason.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:45.120]  Yeah, I think Moneyball again, it's weird.
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:50.200]  And I do realize too, that I'm intimately familiar with Apple and their products and,
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:54.060]  you know, at least Steve Jobs is public life.
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:57.840]  And so all these inaccuracies jump out to me.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.800]  And in a way that I'm not quite with Moneyball, because I'm a baseball fan, but I can't say
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:07.480]  that I followed the Oakland athletics to the degree that I follow Apple.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.960]  But I think that the money I don't think people associated with it, the real people in it
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:14.120]  really had money much to complain about.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:15.120]  Yeah.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:18.640]  I mean, I don't think Billy Bean really, I mean, how can you complain if Brad Pitt is
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:19.640]  playing you?
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:20.640]  No, exactly.
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:23.960]  Like, that's, that's an upgrade on every level of the word.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:29.040]  You know, I don't know, it's, it's I, I have very mixed feelings about it.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:34.880]  It's not it was an enjoyable movie, but it's absolutely positively wasn't had it didn't
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:37.440]  have anything to do with the actual Steve Jobs.
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:38.440]  Yeah.
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:40.240]  Or almost very little.
[02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:43.000]  I would have been surprised if it did, honestly.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.440]  He wanted to tell a character study and he wanted to he wanted to shape the character
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:51.180]  and the he's been really obsessed the last couple I want to say the last couple projects
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:57.400]  he's done with father daughter relationships to money had one, you know, yeah, so I think
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.600]  that that was more of his like, Oh, yeah, I can write the Steve Jobs movie, but I'm
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.040]  not actually going to write about Steve Jobs.
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:04.880]  I'm going to write about what I want to write about.
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:05.880]  Yeah.
[02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:08.720]  And fundamentally, that is what this movie is about Aaron Sorkin.
[02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:12.120]  Steve Jobs is is a father daughter relationship story.
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:13.120]  Yeah.
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:14.120]  Which could have been great.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:16.240]  It could have been a great movie if it wasn't titled Steve Jobs.
[02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:17.240]  Yeah.
[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:22.360]  And even in my opinion, even with that it wasn't great because I thought the third
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:25.600]  third act was really
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:26.600]  not great.
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:30.560]  Yeah, like the it just was it just didn't ring true.
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:36.040]  Not not true to like what I know to be factually true, but like it just contrived is maybe
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:37.040]  the word.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:38.040]  Yeah, here's my notes.
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:42.720]  I wrote last night watching it melodramatic, but contrived is probably a better word.
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:47.560]  And I thought even even bordering a little bit, it got a little boring in the last third.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.600]  It'll be interesting to see how it plays.
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:50.460]  I'm curious to see how big of a hit it is.
[02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:51.460]  I will say this too.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:55.960]  And it really made me cringe as it was a theater full of college students.
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:56.960]  Good crowd.
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:57.960]  I mean, it was free.
[02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:01.840]  I think free movies go over pretty well, pretty well on colleges, college campuses.
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:09.560]  And when the credits came up and everybody stood up, there was the young woman right
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:10.560]  behind me.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:16.720]  She said to her friend, wow, if that was my dad, I'd be using an Android.
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:17.720]  Wow.
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:23.480]  I swear to God, that was what she said, because it's you know, it does not paint a good picture
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:24.480]  of him.
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:25.480]  No.
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.680]  And I just thought, oh, I was like, that's that's rough.
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:33.960]  Well, the thing that I don't really understand is if you really wanted to tell a father daughter
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.880]  piece, you could have done a really interesting thing.
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:37.880]  Skip.
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:42.220]  I mean, I think the iMac from a product release standpoint is a pretty pivotal moment in Apple's
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:43.220]  history.
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:47.060]  But I you know, if you really wanted to compare Steve Jobs as the father, you should have
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:52.960]  done the iPhone release, because that actually gives him a family that's not Lisa.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.960]  Right.
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:57.800]  That gives that you know, that that gives him a chance to basically press the redo button
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:59.840]  on being a father.
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:02.760]  And you want, I don't know, this is me rewriting.
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:04.320]  This is me rewriting Aaron Sorkin.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:07.400]  So apparently, I know better than a Emmy award-winning screenwriter.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:12.280]  But I, this is not a plot spoiler, you know, because that's the thing, there isn't really
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:13.560]  much of a plot to spoil.
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:15.600]  I mean, it's a biopic.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:18.060]  And they never even get because it ends in 1998.
[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:22.000]  There's absolutely no, no, nothing about his illness or anything like that.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  No.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.020]  It but it's like, they can't help themselves.
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:26.520]  And it's like, oh, come on.
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.360]  And in 1998, his daughter was still walking around with a cassette playing Walkman.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:32.440]  And he's like, I'm gonna fix that.
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:34.400]  I'm gonna put 500 songs in your pocket.
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.200]  No, 5000 songs, not well, something between 500 and 5000.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:39.200]  But I'm going to do it.
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:41.480]  I'm going to put it in your pocket, because I'm so sick of seeing you with that stupid
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:43.360]  tape player.
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.000]  Oh, my God.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  And it's like, oh, come on.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  Wink.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  Wink.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.000]  Right.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  Exactly.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  Exactly.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  Then he turns to the camera and
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.880]  you get a little musical sting.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:55.880]  Yeah.
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:56.880]  That's a shame.
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:00.120]  I you know, I really like Sorkin.
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:05.160]  He's very flawed as a writer, but I I love I love musical dialogue.
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160]  And yes.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:07.160]  And the idea.
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:08.160]  Yeah.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:12.640]  The idea of Sorkin writing Jobs or at least a slim variation of just like Jobs has great
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:13.640]  musical dialogue.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:15.600]  Sorkin has great musical dialogue.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.280]  This could possibly be amazing.
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:19.480]  Or Sorkin could fall down one of his rabbit holes and it could be
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.560]  I do it.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  There is good dialogue.
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:29.000]  I mean, again, you have to be able to let go and I am enough of a a cinema fan that
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:34.900]  I can sort of at times if the movie is made by talented people, I can I can disengage
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:39.080]  from whether or not the movie is drawing me in and just sort of watch it in a different
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.080]  way.
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.080]  And I could do that.
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.040]  And there are definitely good characters.
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:44.040]  What's her name?
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:45.040]  Who plays Joanna Hoffman?
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:46.360]  Oh, Kate Winslet.
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  Kate Winslet.
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:48.560]  Really, really good.
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:51.720]  I think if anybody gets any kind of award nominations out of this, it's going to be
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:52.720]  her.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.120]  But I think she's remarkable.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:55.720]  And it's a great character.
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:59.640]  And I don't know anything about the real Joanna Hoffman, so I can't compare it.
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:00.900]  You know, I don't know.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:08.160]  But she has a super great role in this movie, really well written, really great dynamic
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.080]  over the the, you know, the 15 year stretch that it covers.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.320]  And she just it she's the reason to see the movie, I think.
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:22.120]  And it's it's a great performance and really, really well written character.
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:26.040]  Well, that's actually really phenomenal to hear because I know Sorkin's had trouble writing
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:27.040]  women lately.
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:30.120]  Oh, I think that she's she's the example.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.580]  It's a great, great female character, in my opinion.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:33.580]  Number one reason to watch the movie.
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:38.620]  And I can totally see why actors would want to play his characters, because I really feel
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.880]  like there's a lot of meat.
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:41.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:47.240]  I feel like and I feel like I said, all the main characters, Jobs and and Joanna Hoffman
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:54.800]  and Andy Hertzfeld, and was and although the was that Seth Rogen plays, again, is I would
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:59.200]  say he bears less resemblance to the real was then then fast benders jobs does to the
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:00.200]  real job.
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.600]  He doesn't bear any resemblance to the real was not even just physically just everything
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:05.320]  about him is very different.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:07.800]  But it's an interesting character in a movie if you don't pretend that he's supposed to
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:13.360]  be was and especially john Scully played by
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:19.540]  Oh, gosh, why can't I remember his name, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff Daniels, who I love.
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:21.800]  And he and he does so well with Sorkin's writing.
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:24.320]  I mean, he's a highlight of the newsroom for me.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.320]  Yeah.
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:27.680]  And he really steals the show in this too.
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:30.020]  And he doesn't have a huge role.
[02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:31.920]  But he's one of the major, you know, major characters.
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:33.840]  And he's, he's really good.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:35.680]  Really, really good.
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:36.680]  Yeah.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.760]  So anyway, that's, that's my talk show review of Steve Jobs.
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:43.600]  It's good, you know, good, good overview.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.960]  I think I will see it.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:47.880]  I you should see I would recommend that you see it.
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:48.880]  Yeah.
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:54.340]  I mean, yeah, I just I'm gonna go into it, as you said, with with film critic eyes on
[02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:58.280]  and not with not with tech writer job eyes on.
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:28:59.280]  Right?
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:03.320]  It's, it's, I'll bet you'll come out and another way to put it is it's exactly what you think
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  it is.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:06.320]  Yeah.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.120]  And it's, you know, disappointing in some ways, but we're seeing in others, if you can
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:12.600]  put aside the factual stuff.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.280]  If you can pretend if you can ignore the fact that most of the movie isn't actually true.
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.280]  It's great.
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.280]  But again, it's fiction.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:25.400]  I I'm not I wasn't expecting Sorkin to do a note for note biopic when he was announced
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:30.440]  that he was writing it and just wasn't gonna wasn't gonna fly.
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:31.800]  I think that about wraps it up.
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:34.140]  Let me thank our sponsors.
[02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:40.400]  This week we have harvest, time tracker, mail route, great service for filtering all the

[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:04.000]  Saturn se TT er n, it's a good Twitter account.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.340]  And and I thank you for your time.
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:10.200]  Anything else you want to anything else you want to pimp you got any books that came out?
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:14.120]  We did write a book on Apple Music if you're if you're having trouble with that, the big
[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:19.320]  thing is actually not tech related, or semi tech related and that Jason Snell of former
[02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:23.840]  mackerel and now six colors fame, and myself and David lore, who is a playwright and also
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:29.520]  Twitter enthusiast, along with a whole host of other people have put together a old timey
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:34.200]  radio theater podcast called the incomparable radio theater and we're doing season one right
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:39.220]  now and we're four or five or four episodes in I think of a 12 episode season and it's
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:41.520]  been really fun.
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:45.900]  Lots of guest voices that you may recognize from the tech community.
[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:49.500]  And also, you know, getting cameos just left and right.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:50.500]  It's been a blast.
[02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:57.460]  It's such a fun like, late record late night put together Jason does magic of editing wizardry
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:02.760]  Chris Breen formerly of mackerel now of Apple does amazing music.
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:04.320]  It's just it's it's a fun little thing.
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.400]  Aren't we supposed to say he works for a fruit company?
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:07.720]  He does work for a fruit company.
[02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:09.800]  They may sell apples.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:10.800]  It does sound like fun.
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:13.520]  I will put a link to that in the show notes.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:17.640]  And it seems as though everybody it seems like everybody is desperate for podcasts to
[02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:18.680]  listen to.
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.120]  Because last week, Marco and I were talking about Hello internet.
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:26.080]  And Hello internet shot up from like number three on the overcast recommended list to
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:30.320]  number one passing even Marco's own podcast.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:35.200]  I don't know if that was entirely me and Marco's doing but anybody's looking for a good podcast
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:36.560]  that does sound like fun.
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:42.480]  And it also sounds like it's a lot different than the average tech show two people talking
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:45.540]  about this week's news tech show.
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:47.000]  So anyway, I will put a link into that.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  That sounds great.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  Thank you.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  Serenity.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000]  Thank you, john.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.480]  Actually, before we go, I did want to mention because it just happened today.
[02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:56.240]  Gary Allen, who ran Apple store.
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:00.920]  Yeah, he just passed away from brain cancer, which is in part why he shut down IFO Apple
[02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:01.920]  store.
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:06.880]  And I don't know, I, I, as somebody as a former Apple retail employee, and someone who religiously
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.800]  checked that site for many years, it, it feels like we lost a good one today.
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:11.880]  Yeah, it really does.
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:14.600]  And it makes me sad.
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:16.320]  I never really I don't think I ever met him.
[02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:17.320]  I mean, either.
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:20.680]  I've certainly linked to him a lot over the years, because he was the definitive.
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:23.640]  I mean, what a weird beat to eke out.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:26.320]  But I remember when he first started doing, I was like, that's a crazy beat.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:29.600]  But then for years to come, it was like, you know, he was the source.
[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:30.600]  Yeah.
[02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:31.600]  And if there was nothing to write, he didn't write.
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:34.240]  And if there were new stores, he wrote about him.
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:39.000]  But when he stopped writing the site back in March, I was, I just thought, well, all
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  right, he's done.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.940]  But it turns out that was because he knew he had the diagnosis and he didn't want to
[02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:49.880]  go public with it and have people, you know, making a fuss out.
[02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:55.500]  So anyway, my best to anybody who knew him and any friends or family who knew him.
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:56.500]  It is a real shame.
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:58.740]  We should call that out.
[02:32:58.740 --> 02:32:59.740]  He will be missed.
[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:00.740]  He will.
[02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:01.740]  All right.
[02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:02.740]  Thank you, Serenity.
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:03.740]  Thank you, John.
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:04.740]  This was a blast.
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:32.000]  This was amazing.
