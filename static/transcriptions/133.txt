[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  All right, no jack hammers, no Lana instruments, thank God.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  That was the funniest coincidence ever.
[00:09.000 --> 00:11.000]  So anyway, serenity Caldwell is here.
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  Yesterday, we tried to record this episode and I had a jack hammer outside my window.
[00:16.000 --> 00:24.000]  And when that stopped, a lawn crew showed out outside serenity's window with a rock n' mower.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  The biggest lawn mower I have ever seen for a portable lawn crew.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  It was quite something, but not very conducive to podcasting.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  What that big John Deere that Tony Stark was supposed to fix.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  Never did.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  Yeah, pretty much that.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Only noisier and louder.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  That's right.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  He never did fix the lawn mower, the tractor, whatever it is.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  The McGuffin tractor.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  All right.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  So, I don't know.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  A lot's going on.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  New IMAX.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  No new MacBooks though.
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.000]  No new MacBooks.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  They are still on the watch list.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  I don't know if we'll get new MacBooks before the end of the year.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  I would have guessed.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  I think if we would have, it would have happened all at once.
[01:05.000 --> 01:06.000]  Yeah.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  Yeah.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  I don't see it.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  There's no need to have a third non-existent event.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  This is where being a podcaster, I'm starting to get lazy.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  I am not super well informed on the new IMAX.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  Are you?
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Yeah, I mean, I'm fairly impressed.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  Yeah.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  I got you coverage on.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  No, Renee got the information a little bit early and was able to
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  basically give me an FAQ of epic proportions to fill out.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  So, we've got new 21.5-inch IMAX is the biggest news.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  And they are 4K retina.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  It's only like the original 27-inch IMAX.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  It's only the top-end model that's retina.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  So, you can still get 21.5-inch IMAX that are your normal
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  poor than average resolution quality in comparison to the rest of the
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  Mac and iOS line.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  But those started, I think, 14.99 and 4K or slightly more than 4K.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  I think it's like 4K.5 with improved color definition.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  They're using the same, I don't know the phrase off the top of my head
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  because I'm a bad film student, but they're basically using the same color
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  profiles as you would with the digital projectors.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  So, it allows it to be more true to life when you're editing,
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  when you're color correcting both video and photography.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  And the 27-inch IMAX get that too.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  They don't get a boost above their 5K.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  They're still 5K and magical and far too.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  It will just get sucked into their beautiful screen.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  But they also have improved color definition.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  And they get Skylake Intel's next generation processor,
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  which has been a long time coming, but no Thunderbolt 3.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  And the 21.5-inch IMAX are still stuck on Broadwell
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  because the integrated Intel processor,
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  the graphics processor doesn't play nice with Skylake yet,
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  because root maps.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  Yeah, so now my year old 5K IMAX that I'm looking at is outdated.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  A little bit outdated.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  I was actually looking at some of the, I think,
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Jason Snell's review had initial benchmarks from Geekbench.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  And it was saying, oh yeah, the new 21.5-inch IMAX,
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  outpaces some for 5K, 27-inch IMAX.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  And I'm like, I guess I'm kind of glad I waited now.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  So yeah, I'm still, I'm going to go in for the 21.5-inch.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  So the 27-inch is still going to kick my bacon with fancy Skylake
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  Mumblety Jumble.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  Yeah, I don't feel too bad about it.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  I mean, it's inevitable.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  It's all whole, you got a whole year as the king of the hill.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  Exactly.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  And I still subscribe to the, I like to buy a Mac,
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  Mac sit out and then use it until, you know, for years until it gets low.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  Cause I still find it even with Dropbox and iCloud and other things.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  I still find that it takes me forever to get a Mac set up just the way I want it.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  Yeah, even, I mean, it's been, it's gotten a lot better than it used to be
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  where I still remember the days of just having to clone my hard drive
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  because the idea of reinstalling all of my applications
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  and tweaking my preferences just made me want to throw up.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  But yeah, I, I feel the same way.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  I still have a 2008 MacBook Pro,
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  unibody MacBook Pro that I put an SSD in three years ago.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  And it's still almost as fast as my MacBook Air.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  I mean, it's a, it's a pain in the butt because it's 15 inches.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  And it's not really a, a super portable machine and it's not retina.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  But it's still one of those things where I'm like, well, it's still perfectly good.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  And it's still fast.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  I feel weird just being like, no, sorry.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  You're, you're going to go on a drawer.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  I'm not going to use you anymore.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  You really can't do that for an iMac.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  No, I, I really, I, what I did last year when I bought this is I just bought the
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  best one that they would sell me.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  I just maxed out the RAM.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  I got the one terabyte SSD.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  So, you know, it was, I forget how much that cost.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  I think it was like $3,300, $3,500.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Sounds about right.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Some have seen amount of money.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  But my thinking is just max it out and I'll use it for at least four years.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  Yeah.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  And then by the time I upgrade it will be nice.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  But anyway, it's the, the, the color stuff hurts a little bit because.
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.000]  Yeah.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  So I think they, it correct me if I'm wrong.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  You probably know more about this to me.
[05:18.000 --> 05:24.000]  To me, the, the old consumer gold standard was the SRGB color space.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  Yes, correct.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  And the, the, the basic gist if you just want to get a handle on this is that the new
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  color space that the, that all of these retina displays both the 21 inch and
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  the, the 27 inch is significantly bigger than SRGB.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  It's, it's much more of a pro color space.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Very much so.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  And very, very similar to the kind of output that you're going to get on to
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  digital projector.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  So I'm looking up for nays FAQ now so I can actually have specific terms.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  They're using DCIP3, which is the same color space used by digital movie
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  theaters.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  Yeah.
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.000]  And they're using a different LED type display now.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  It's a more advanced red green phosphor LED, which allows them to do better
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  color balance and hit wider ranges of colors, which that combined with the
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  new color space really, really makes for some crystal clear photos and
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.000]  video.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  They're not, not that the 5K was hurting in that before.
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  But I, I do feel that professional professional editors are going to hear that
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  and just be like, yeah, why do I own a Mac pro?
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Why do I own a fucking?
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  Why don't I own this machine?
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  Why can't I just replace it?
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  Oh wait, I can.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  I just have to spend a ton of money.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  Um, and I think it's funny, it's funny the way that even with the Macs,
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  they're sort of as they march towards this all retina lineup.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  I mean, and it's, it's a year by year March.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  We're now it's by far the overwhelming majority of the project products are all retina.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Finally, yeah.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  Um, and it's funny the way it sort of follows like the precedent that they've set
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  with the iPads.
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  Like to me, the, the 21 inch iMac is sort of like the, the iPad mini compared
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  to the iPad air, which is the 27 inch iMac.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  So it gets everything a year ahead.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  It goes retina first.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  Now a year later, you can only get the 27 inch in retina.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Mm hmm.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  And the 21 inch does exactly what the 27 inch did last year,
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  which is there's a high end model with a retina display,
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  but you can still get the non retina.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  So my guess is by next year, there will be no more non retina iMacs.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.000]  Yeah.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  There'll only be even higher resolution retina iMacs.
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000]  Yeah.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  I really like this.
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  It's a, from a business standpoint,
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  it seems like a good way to roll things out.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  They're like, oh, these displays are too expensive for your average user
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  to want to pony eight top 3,000 plus dollars.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  So we're going to put them in the high end models for the people who are really
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  going to appreciate them and be able to spend money on them.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  And then the more money they spend on them, the more orders that we can place
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  with our suppliers and the more orders we can place with our suppliers,
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  we can bring the cost down and it just trickles down into the rest of the,
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  rest of the line.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  Um, the, the, the low end model, I don't even know what it used to be,
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  but it's, it is kind of a, it seems kind of wimpy.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.000]  Yeah.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  It's only a 1.6.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  And I know, you know, like, the,
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  none of us really talk about gigahertz anymore.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  I mean, it's, it's gotten away from us.
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  But when it's half half the speed in gigahertz as the one that's only $400
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  more, it kind of sticks out.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  It's definitely an upsell.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  I mean, I have to assume that these, the low end models are really designed
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  for the education market or they're designed for the folks who,
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  oh, well, you just need an iMac in your place of business or you need a,
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  an iMac that's essentially a glorified display to play a movie on.
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  Yeah.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  Um, I don't know about education anymore because I think that the so
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  mentioned of education has gone to laptop form factors of some kind,
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  you know, a lot of Chromebooks.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  Let's, you know, for sure.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  No question.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  But, you know, it doesn't seem to me like school.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  And it is like a practical aspect of that too.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  Like if you're going to go with iMacs,
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  you need to set them up in a permanent spot,
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  whereas the whole just of moving, you know,
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  especially like in what I'm familiar with,
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  with my son with the elementary school.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's that they can take the Chromebooks and,
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  and the MacBooks out when they need them and set them up work,
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  you know, on the regular desks that they use for everything else.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  Yeah, you don't need to go into a separate computer room.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  I think I'm more, I'm more thinking administration-wise.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  Where you're looking at, yeah, non-profits
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  or people who really don't have a big budget for their electronics,
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  which is sad at little bit in 2015.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  Or if you're just going to use it as the machine at the front desk
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  for people to sign in when they come into the office or something,
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  and you really don't need performance.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  If you haven't switched already to an iPad.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  Yeah.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  What else are people complaining about?
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  I know people are complaining that the hard drive is 5,400 RPM.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  Yeah.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  I'm, I would rather complain that they're not SSDs in the, in the,
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  I'm Mac by default.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  But, you know, if I guess if we want to complain about hard drive speed,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  we can complain about hard drive speed.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  But I think it has something to do with the 21.5 inches,
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  a 2.5 inch hard drive is opposed to a 3.5 inch hard drive.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  So a little bit trickier there.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  Yeah, in a weird way, even though it's 21 inches,
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  it's sort of like the, in some ways,
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  in some ways, I think the guts of a laptop.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  Yeah.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  Well, when you think about how thin the 21.5 inch iMac is,
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  and just how much space of that has to be filled with,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  oh, you know, giant retina display.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  And cooling said giant retina display,
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  you really don't have all that much more area to, to put in high level chips.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  Uh, without necessary, unless, unless they figure out a way to flatten silicon
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  even more, like, oh, yes, we're going to line, line the edges of the iMac display
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  with, uh, with silicon chips now.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  Um, I did notice too, on the 21 inch,
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  the storage for flash only goes up to 512.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  So if you want a terabyte, you're looking at,
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  but I guess that kind of makes sense.
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  I feel like, because the terabyte of flash storage is still very expensive,
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  uh, relative to hard drive prices for sure.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Uh, and I guess once you're in that sort of budget range,
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  you're looking at the 27 inch anyway.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Yeah, when I was pricing out my 21.5,
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  and for me, I, I prefer slightly the 21.5 space for my desk,
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  because I, I don't know, the 27 inch, like, is gorgeous,
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  but I feel myself getting lost in that space, especially in retina,
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  where it's just, it's too much, too much for me, unless I'm editing video,
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  in which case, oh, this is nice, pixel for pixel 4K is great.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  But when I was pricing out my 21.5 inch iMac,
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  I, I, I was looking at the price, and I was like, all right,
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  so I'm upgrading to a fusion drive, and I'm upgrading the memory,
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  and, you know, I'm putting on a magic track pad, because so magic mice.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  And then I'm, I'm looking at the price, I'm like,
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  this is basically the price of a mid level to high level 27 inch stock iMac.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  Yeah.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  And I, yeah, I think you're absolutely right,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  where people look at that price, and they're like, well,
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  but I could go bigger, and bigger would make, you know, bigger is always better, right?
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  And, for the most part, I, you know, again,
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  there are certain circumstances where I actually think a 21.5 is better than a 27,
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  but I think for the vast majority of users, they're like, oh, I can get a bigger screen
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  for the same amount of tweaking as, you know, I would pay for trying to upgrade
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  the internals of a 21.5, sign me up.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Yeah.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  Is all of the RAM, do you know this, is the RAM soldered onto the motherboard?
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Like, it is in the 21.5.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  It is not in the 21.7, which I did, or 21.7, the 20, the 27 inch, yeah.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  So that's just another way where there is sort of a consumer slash pro split
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  between 21 and 27.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Mm-hmm.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's very, I think the 21 is still very much marketed towards the,
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  not even the entry level user, but the user who either has their first Mac
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  or is about to get their first Mac and needs a desktop over a laptop or an iPad.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Right.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  I kind of feel, I understand, you know, the,
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  there's a couple people on Twitter who have emailed me about the soldering of the RAM,
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  and it seems like that's a real sticking point for a certain segment of the audience.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  But I really feel like, it's almost like we're lucky that you can do it on any of the machines anymore.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Yeah.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Like, it's just not the way of the future.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  Like, your computers from Apple come out of China completely set
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  for the most part.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  So my, you know, I, you know, take it, you know,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  so the fact that you can still add your,
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  diddle with the RAM on your own on the 27 inch, take that as a win.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  And I, I wouldn't lose much sleep over the 21.5 being, you know,
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  you choose eight or 16 and live with it forever.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  I would, I would much prefer to be able to remove and,
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  and, and twiddle with RAM and there's, and there's a model to do that.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  But for the, again, the average user, I just don't think cares.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  No, and I feel like it's another, it's another way that the iOS devices,
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  again, I, I, you know, Apple, people keep asking and Apple keep saying,
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  no, we're not going to have one operating system for everything.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  And I really think that they're serious about it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  But they are, you, you can see where, you know,
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  one platform is going by where the other platform has gone first and the,
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  the iOS hardware model of there's nothing that you can alter or adjust.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  There's no way to put a, a memory card in to expand the storage or anything like that,
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  is definitely the way the Mac is heading.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  Yeah.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  I, and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing anymore.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  I know there's a lot of people have been arms or it's always less repairable
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  and, oh, what if I want a tinker with my computer?
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Well, there, there's still ways to build your own computer.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  It's just not going to be from Apple.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  I don't see that there's something wrong with Apple saying, you know what?
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  We know what the best processors in the market are going to be.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  We know what the, the best memory is going to be and we're going to package it up in a,
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  you know, in a package that actually makes sense for you as a user that would give you real world usage.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  I mean, we've never been able to tinker with an iPhone's internals.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  And I don't think anybody's complaining about that because most people wouldn't know how to even begin to solder micro architecture.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  It's only because the iMacs architecture is big enough that we, at one point,
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  we're able to feasibly play around with it that we're like, yeah, we can totally build a better computer than Apple.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  No problem.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Apple's totally wrong.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  You don't need eight gigabytes.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  You need more than eight gigabytes of RAM and then that I kind of agree with the general population on.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  But, but still, I, I don't think that it's necessarily a bad thing.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Um, and then lastly, you touched on this a few minutes ago, but it's at this point.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  And I, I don't think the Mac Pro is dead.
[16:08.000 --> 16:18.000]  I think that there will be a new one at some point, but who knows when and you don't have to just look at the new Darth Vader Mac Pro.
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  You could just look back at maybe even going back close to 10 years now that the Mac Pro just does not see updates anywhere near on a yearly schedule.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  No, it doesn't make sense also to be perfectly honest.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  Because the Mac Pro has such different internals than the other, than the other two lines.
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  And because their internals are very, at least at this point, very hog-tied to Intel's rollout schedule,
[16:43.000 --> 16:50.000]  like it doesn't make sense for the, for the Mac Pro to be updated until they can have a processor that has full Thunderbolt 3 functionality.
[16:50.000 --> 16:57.000]  So they could, you know, say release a retina display with, uh, with Thunderbolt 3 so that people could have their, their 4K display without an iMac.
[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  Um, but it doesn't like, I don't know, it seems, it seems silly to me to push like incremental updates to the Mac Pro.
[17:04.000 --> 17:14.000]  Or the Mac, the Mac Pro because the only, the only people who are buying it are, at this point, are serious bros because the MyMac has filled that kind of semi-pro hole.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  So if you're buying a serious pro machine, you're only going to upgrade your serious pro machine.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  Like we were talking about earlier, when your old pro machine is about ready to die or it does something so spectacularly different.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  That is going to be better for you.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  Yeah.
[17:29.000 --> 17:38.000]  But for some people, I think it's clearly, you know, the, the big iMac, the 27 inch iMac is the, the proper pro machine for them.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  Like I'm thinking like, especially like photographers and video editors.
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  Oh yeah.
[17:43.000 --> 17:55.000]  Because of the extra color space, because there is no retina display from Apple, you know, the only way to get it, anything like a retina display is sort of a hack at this point with the Mac Pro.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Um, it's, I think it's clearly the better machine.
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  But then I wonder if they buy them now, are they going to be mad if, you know, Mac Pro's are announced at WWDC or something like that?
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  Yeah, where it's like, oh, now we have a Thunderbolt 3 retina display.
[18:10.000 --> 18:17.000]  I mean, when you're talking about that kind of a space, it depends on what project you're working on right now, right?
[18:17.000 --> 18:24.000]  If they need retina support, if they're working on 4K video and actively, you know, doing that for their job, they're going to want a good 4K.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  And the real question is, well, can I get that from a third party?
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  And is it still going to look great?
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  Or do I want to go to, you know, a machine that has DCI color space and use that instead?
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  And I think that might be the, the silly fact, will they, will they be then grumpy?
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  If Apple's like, yes, now we have a pro that supports the retina display there.
[18:44.000 --> 18:51.000]  But if they needed that functionality six months ago, then that, that announcement six months later isn't going to help them.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Like, it isn't going to help them finish this project today.
[18:54.000 --> 19:20.000]  Yeah, maybe, and, you know, maybe this is wishful thinking, but maybe once, like, I feel like the, in a lot of ways, all of these machines, the move to retina has been difficult for every single thing because it's always a lot because you're effectively going to four times the pixels, you know, at least at some point you're going to say, here's a new, here's a new machine that replaces one from last year and it has four times the pixels.
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  Right? I mean, and so, like, it was a huge deal when the iPhone four when retina in 2010 and the iPad took a while to follow.
[19:29.000 --> 19:35.000]  Max took a long time to follow and it was only on one model, the 15 inch MacBook Pro at first.
[19:35.000 --> 19:43.000]  And I feel like the Mac Pro is the last and it's the hardest because they can't just seal it all up.
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  Like, with the, you know, remember the crazy story about how they got the 5K iMac last year was with this weird internal.
[19:51.000 --> 19:59.000]  You know, how are they driving all those pixels when it seems like there is in a graphics card to do it and they had to write their own, you know, video controller.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  Right, they had to invent hardware to do it.
[20:02.000 --> 20:08.000]  With a Mac Pro, they really are stuck waiting on Thunderbolt 3 because it has to be a cable.
[20:08.000 --> 20:22.000]  Yeah, they can't, they can't write their own graphics controller in a machine that they're not, you know, they just don't have the, they don't have the flexibility right now without having a display that they connect via Thunderbolt 3 or something along those lines.
[20:22.000 --> 20:32.000]  So maybe once they make, this is where I'm going, maybe once they make that leap and maybe, you know, I can't help but think it's a 2016 thing that at some point in 2016,
[20:32.000 --> 20:45.000]  whether it's early in the year or WWDC or next October at the latest that they'll have a Mac Pro update and a, you know, whatever they're going to call it, Cinema Display Thunderbolt 3 display, whatever.
[20:45.000 --> 20:54.000]  But a standalone retina display comparable or even better than the 5K iMac display for Mac Pros.
[20:54.000 --> 21:06.000]  Maybe once they make that leap, maybe then the Mac Pro can see a slightly more regular incremental updates because they've already made that jump and they can just sort of keep, you can maintain.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  Right, keep dipping in with the latest and greatest incremental updates from Intel.
[21:11.000 --> 21:23.000]  Yeah, I mean, until, until they decide to make another logical leap, which Intel is unable to, it's, it feels like that we're talking about power PCs and we're suddenly in early 2000s.
[21:23.000 --> 21:33.000]  It's, it's so weird to me that all of a sudden, you know, Intel, which we used to hold up this kind of the gold standard of like regular TikTok updates is now very much a little hamstrung.
[21:33.000 --> 21:44.000]  Where I, what the Mac Book Pros were waiting on Broadwell chips for a very long time. The new iMacs were waiting on Skylake and eventually shipped half and half.
[21:44.000 --> 21:53.000]  Like that, that kind of stuff is so crazy. The Mac Pros are probably waiting on Skylake and Thunderbolt 3 to build proper Cinema displays.
[21:53.000 --> 22:02.000]  I wonder also how long Apple is going to continue being like, well, we have to wait around for our manufacturing partners because they've really, they've cut most of that out on the, on the iOS level.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  You know, they're not waiting around for a lot of people because they're building their own chips.
[22:07.000 --> 22:13.000]  Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't think they can do that on the high end pro side within, you know, with Intel.
[22:13.000 --> 22:28.000]  Yeah, not, certainly not right now. Right. And even in the foreseeable future, if, you know, and this is rabbit hole, we don't have to go down, but the whole idea of Arm-based Macs clearly in the same way that retina came in at the, you know, step by step.
[22:28.000 --> 22:36.000]  Arm-based Macs, if it ever happens, are going to come in not all at once, but step by step, and it's going to start with the, you know, one port MacBook.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  Oh, yeah, it'll start at the very low end. I don't even, yeah, I can't, I can't imagine an Arm-based Mac Pro is definitely a ways away.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  Yeah, it's possible, but it's, you know, that's, that's like outside the event horizon that's.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  Yes.
[22:50.000 --> 23:03.000]  I guess the thing that leaves people with a bad taste in our mouth though is that if you, if you are a premium customer at Apple and you have money to burn, it's easy to feel confident that you've got the best thing.
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  Like you can just go in and you know if you're going to buy an iPhone.
[23:08.000 --> 23:19.000]  If you're willing to, if you like the bigger size or just willing to put up with the bigger size, if you get the success plus and you max the storage, you know you're getting the best of everything.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  You've got the image stabilization on the camera and all the best performance.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  And if you don't like the bigger size, you know exactly what you're missing out.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  All you're missing out on is the image stabilization and you've got the best iPhone.
[23:33.000 --> 23:41.000]  iPad, it's really easy to get the best iPad. Everybody knows that the new iPad Pro is going to be the most powerful iPad.
[23:41.000 --> 23:51.000]  And it's the only one that has the, the new, you know, pen based screen, pencil based screen, I keep calling it a pen.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  So, you know, and you know what the trade off is, it's this physical size of the device.
[23:55.000 --> 24:04.000]  And I think what leaves people with a bad taste in our mouth when they've dropped a lot of money on a Mac Pro rig is that they look around and they're like, I don't have the best of anything.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  Yeah, I'm kind of in this, I'm in this purgatory, this pro, this pro purgatory hell.
[24:11.000 --> 24:20.000]  Yeah, I mean, I've talked to a lot of, I have a lot of friends in the film industry and a lot of people have been slowly but surely switching away from Mac Pros.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  And I guess it, Mac Pros makes sense to a certain extent, I guess if you want to rig up, you know, a massive.
[24:25.000 --> 24:40.000]  Yeah, and I shouldn't say that they don't have the best of everything. They do have the best expansion and they do have like a for certain computationally intensive tasks that the having eight cores or however many cores you can max the thing out.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  1662, yeah.
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.000]  Right, you can really, you know, you can do, there's certain tasks that if you can split them up in parallel like that really you can see tremendous advantages.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  So there are some, but it's a mixed bag where you're trading off like you don't have the display anywhere near as nice as the right and the five came back.
[24:56.000 --> 25:07.000]  And the fight, you know, like a, you know, for $2,000 you can buy an iMac with a better display than the, you know, a $20,000 Mac Pro setup could have.
[25:07.000 --> 25:31.000]  I mean, a 12 core Mac Pro is very impressive as you were saying in some respects, but it's interesting to me as somebody who used to live almost obsessively off of, off of towers and then later with the Mac Pro, they're the original sort of pre pre cylindrical pro machine, how much I don't fit into that mindset anymore.
[25:31.000 --> 25:44.000]  Even, you know, I don't do nearly as much film editing as I used to, but still like the iMac really has become I think the desktop machine for 80, 85% of the population including the pros.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  Yeah.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  Or it just, it makes more sense.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  You don't need, well, you don't need the, I mean, you think about where the iMac debuted, right?
[25:50.000 --> 26:00.000]  And Apple had this great, this great, then and now website that they put up alongside the new iMacs where they're like, let's remember back to 1997 and the original iMac.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  And how much faster our new iMacs are versus that.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  The iMac when it came out was very hamstrung and very much a consumer friendly.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  This is the intro, this is your introduction to the Mac line device.
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.000]  And as it's grown throughout the years, it really has, you know, it's been able to beef up what it can do and how it can compete against the Mac Pro.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  And I mean, retina is only the latest series of dynamic and smart improvements that move it on up.
[26:28.000 --> 26:37.000]  You're so, you're not going to get the most cores and you're not going to get the most RAM and you're not going to be able to slot things in and out because the screen is what like an inch stick.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  But it's, it's the better computer for the majority of people.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  I mean, that's, that's Apple's goal, right?
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  They don't want you to have to fiddle around with things.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  Yeah.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  I linked to that side the other day, the, the, the then and now comparison to the 98 iMac and it is, it's a cool comparison to, you know, wow, how quickly we've, you know.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  Yeah, well, I say quickly, but it's been 17 years, but it feels quick.
[27:02.000 --> 27:15.000]  But it is interesting to compare it in this, in the context of this discussion of what do you get if you're a pro and you want to drop is, you know, get the best rig you can in 1998 anybody with a Mac Pro.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  Or is that what would we call Mac Pro's back then?
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  They were G4 G3 towers.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  Power Macs.
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  Power Mac G3s.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Yeah, power Mac G3.
[27:24.000 --> 27:35.000]  I would look at the iMac and say, wow, that's cute, but there wasn't one single thing about it that was better than, you know, performance wise or decisive display wise that you could drive, you know.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  You have fun with your little hockey puck mouse and all in one computer.
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  No, you used to get the hockey puck with the power Mac too.
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  That's right.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  But yeah, but ever, anybody I knew with a, with a power Mac upgraded to a Kensington is like, oh, yes, ball mice are superior.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  You know, I've brought this up many times before over the years, but my wife, Amy, she loved the hockey puck mouse.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  It is not universally loathed.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  There were people and my wife was one of them.
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  She used it for years afterwards like on subsequent, you know, she kept, she kept her iMac mouse and moved it from computer to computer.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  Oh, I, I still have my, my hockey puck mouse.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I, I did like it.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  I didn't like it for certain tasks, but it's cute in its own way.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  It's, it's, it's, it's part of the joy of the iMac.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  I don't know.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  The haters, the haters can go hate somewhere else.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  Yeah, well, hold that thought.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  I'm going to do a sponsor rate, but we'll go back and we'll talk about the new mouse.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  It'll, it's a good segue.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  But first, let me tell everybody about our good friends at Harry's.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  You guys know Harry's.
[28:35.000 --> 28:44.000]  They offer high quality razors and blades for a fraction of the price of the big name brand razor brands.
[28:44.000 --> 28:52.000]  Harry's was started by two guys who just wanted a better product without paying an arm and like, because shaving stuff razor blades are super expensive.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  There's no reason for it.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  So Harry's, it's super serious about this.
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  They're not just like some kind of thing where they buy white label razor blades and put their own logo on them or whatever.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  They actually were, were sourcing them from an old, really old razor factory in Germany.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  And they liked the product so much that they bought the factory.
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  So these are high quality, high performing German made razor blades.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  That Harry's supervises themselves.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  The reason they can sell stuff for so much less is that it's, it's like the whole internet model.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  It's just direct.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  You go to Harry's website.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  You sign up and they ship it to you.
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  So there's no middlemen.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  There are no distributors.
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.000]  There's no retail like every step of the way when you buy razor blades like at a Walgreens or even at like Amazon.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Or something like that.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  It's a little bit of markup.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  Each step of the way goes to a distributor, goes to the retailer and everybody takes a little cut.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  Harry's just sells these things direct right from them, right to you.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  And the prices are amazing.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  They have a starter set.
[29:53.000 --> 30:02.000]  15 bucks gets you a razor, your choice of moisturizing shave cream or gel and three razor blades.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  And when you need more blades, they are two bucks each or less.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  You can get an eight pack for just 15 bucks.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  But if you want to buy them bulk, they get cheaper and cheaper.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  16 pack is 25 bucks.
[30:13.000 --> 30:19.000]  If you go to Amazon, Gillette Fusion's 12 pack of blades is 41 bucks.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  So it's like half the price of a Gillette Fusion.
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.000]  Totally serious.
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  I use it myself.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  Very, very comparable quality wise.
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.000]  I've had mine.
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  I don't know.
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  Long time listeners of the show know that Harry's just been sponsoring the show for at least two years.
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  It may be even longer.
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  And they sent me one way back when they started.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  I still have that razor handle.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  And I look at it now.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  It looks brand new.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  It looks mint condition.
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  It looks like I could just package it up and sell it as mint.
[30:45.000 --> 30:46.000]  Really high quality stuff.
[30:46.000 --> 30:54.000]  So go check them out at harries.com and the code, the promo code is the talk show.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  And if you are a first time customer, you will save five bucks off your first purchase,
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  which means you can get that starter kit for just 10 bucks, which is amazing.
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  So go to harries.com and the code is the talk show.
[31:07.000 --> 31:16.000]  So the other new stuff that Apple announced this week with these iMacs are all new wireless peripherals,
[31:16.000 --> 31:25.000]  new keyboard accessories, new keyboard, a new magic trackpad, and a new magic mouse.
[31:25.000 --> 31:28.000]  I just can't call it the magic mouse. It just makes me crack up every time.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  I think of like the little cartoon characters.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  I, you know, it's funny because I feel like we get used to Apple's names.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  And I remember like MacBook was...
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  Oh, MacBook was so hard.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  It just seemed, I don't know.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  It just was really hard for me to get it.
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.000]  And now, you know, it just, your brain gets bludgeoned into accepting it over time.
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.000]  It's second nature.
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  You're like, all right.
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  I've given up.
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  I won't call it a power book anymore.
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  Sorry, Apple.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  And I understand the logic of it because the power and power book was from power PC.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  And it wasn't really branded by Apple.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  Whereas putting Mac in the name really does help.
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.000]  It actually makes some kind of sense that all of the Macs would have the word Mac in them.
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.000]  Yeah.
[32:14.000 --> 32:15.000]  Right. I understand that.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  But MacBook was somehow a mouthful.
[32:18.000 --> 32:23.000]  It just doesn't seem like two words that fit quite as well together as powerbook did.
[32:23.000 --> 32:28.000]  But to me, they call it these things magic.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  That's always, it embarrasses me every time I have to type it or say it.
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  Yeah.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  It feels right.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  Oh, yes.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  These are different than normal accessories.
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  How you ask?
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  They have magic.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  The magic trackpad.
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  Yeah.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  It still makes me smile.
[32:44.000 --> 32:52.000]  The trackpad, I can kind of understand it because yes, it does especially with the new improvements to this version of the trackpad where it gets the Mac books.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  The Mac books.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Taptic engine and faux clicking.
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  So you're no longer depressing a button.
[32:58.000 --> 33:04.000]  You're using the magic of force touch and the tactic engine to make it feel like you're clicking.
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  Like that, I would actually genuinely use.
[33:06.000 --> 33:10.000]  It feels like magic because you're not actually clicking on anything.
[33:10.000 --> 33:14.000]  But the mouse is still just a mouse.
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  Yeah.
[33:15.000 --> 33:21.000]  And I guess that they're claimed for the magic is that you get both the mouse that moves and you get the, you know,
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  you can do the gestures on the surface.
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  But to me, it's like that, it's just, that's just the way you,
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  you Apple have chosen to implement the scroll wheels and, you know,
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  mice have done more than just move the cursor around for a very long time.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  For a very long time.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  And it's just an implementation detail whether you're going to use a wheel or that,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  remember that little, that little ball they had for a while?
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  Oh, so bad.
[33:48.000 --> 33:57.000]  So truth be told, I have not used an Apple manufactured mouse on a regular basis since the ADB era.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  Wow.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  The last ADB Apple mouse, which was a one button mouse.
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  I loved it.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  It had a good click.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  It had a great click and it had a great form factor.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  It fit my hand the way that I like to hold a mouse.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  I know ATP has gone long on this a while ago that depending on it when you learn to use a mouse,
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  you grip it in a certain way, whether you write, rest your hand on it or something.
[34:21.000 --> 34:30.000]  And the, I need like a big, I don't know, like a much bigger mouse than the magic mouse.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  You need to fit your hand.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  Yeah.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  You need to have a good arc because it's the, it's the exact opposite problem of RSA on a,
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  on a keyboard where you don't necessarily want your wrist arked up with a mouse.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  I feel like you need, you need the comfortable arc to rest your hand on it.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  If you're going to be resting your hand on a mouse for a while and going around and clicking,
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  it needs to feel good.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  And it needs to not feel like your hand is dwarfing the mouse so that you can't actually find the buttons by touch.
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  Yeah.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  So I will confess the mouse that I use.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  I don't know if I can get a picture of this.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  I guess I'll try to maybe put it in the show notes.
[35:02.000 --> 35:11.000]  The mouse that I use is at least, it absolutely positively, I bought it in the 90s.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's from Logitech and even in the 90s, when I bought it, I don't think I paid more than $14 for it.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  And it's so old.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  I swear to God, I'm not making this up.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  It doesn't even have a laser.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  It has a ball.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  Oh man.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  And it is super, super precise.
[35:28.000 --> 35:36.000]  I actually, because of our SI issues, I use a third party mouse driver to, what's it called?
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  I had to switch it one point.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  It's called Steer Mouse, S-T-E-E-R-M-O-U-S-E.
[35:42.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's from some guy in Japan that lets you set your mouse speed significantly faster than the very fastest speed of the system mouse.
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.000]  So I could go, even on my 5K iMac, I can go corner to corner pretty much without even using my wrist, just my fingers.
[36:01.000 --> 36:08.000]  And the ball on this thing is, it's so super precise, like it's like a giant 27 inch screen.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  I have the speed ramped up so far.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Like my son cannot even use it.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  He thinks it's crazy.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  Because he just, it immediately rams from corner to corner by moving it because it's so, you know, the differences is so subtle.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  And this mouse, it just has never broken.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  The buttons still work.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  I mean, at some point, I guess it's going to break.
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  I mean, every button fails eventually, but it's ancient.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  But I haven't used an Apple mouse since the 90s.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  What is it connected via USB to USB?
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  Okay, so at least at least I was going to ask if you were connecting via SCSI, you know, to you or something like crazy.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  But I do still have my ADB keyboard.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  Oh my god.
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  Yeah, you know, I was talking to my dad the other day right after the new accessories came out.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  And he's like rolling his eyes.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  He's like, no, nothing can, nothing can be better than my, my Kensington trackball.
[36:58.000 --> 37:08.000]  And he's still you. And this, that thing is probably from 1999 too, because I remember using it playing like Star Wars episode one pod racer or something crazy like that.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  So it's definitely, I feel like people have very specific preferences with their mice.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  Yeah.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  What I have to do is I got to get an eBay and start hunting around for like another copy.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  But I have to get, I have to get a new in box.
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  Because I mean, there's nothing grosser than using somebody, some mouse that somebody's actually used.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  Years of fingerprints and greasy, you Tito fingers.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  Oh god.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  Like I'm, I'm, I think I'm pretty.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  I think I have good personal hygiene.
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  I'm not, I'm not a real germaphobe, but like I do have some previously used Apple extended keyboard twos.
[37:48.000 --> 37:57.000]  But whenever I get a new one, I really do. I get all sort of like, like CSI like crime scene, like cleaning up.
[37:57.000 --> 38:07.000]  Like I, I break out the alcohol and cotton swipes and, and I mean, I, I go, you know, I get cute tips and I get in there and I'll clean, you know, even if it's.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  Even if it looks like really like very lightly used, which are the best ones very likely used.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  I, I'm going to get in there and scrub it because who the hell knows what people were doing with these things.
[38:16.000 --> 38:30.000]  Oh my god. I mean, I don't, I no longer eat food while working or any of that and like my, I just like, my keyboard should be pristine and then I'm looking down at it as we're talking and it's like the, some of the number pad is just absolutely discussed like brown.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  I do not eat it my desk either. I gave that up many years ago and I still can't believe how disgusting my keyboard can get if I get real close to it.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  Yeah. It's, it's a little bit frightening to me. Well, I know what I'm doing after this podcast.
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  Yeah. And now it's, it does sort of put the heavy geebies in there. Maybe I should just clean like my own key, even my own keyboard grosses me out with somebody else's.
[38:52.000 --> 39:04.000]  So it's hard for me to really get excited about the new magic mouse because I know I'm not going to use it because I know it's the same form factor as the old one and I know that the old form factor to me is extremely uncomfortable to use.
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.000]  Yeah. I don't like it at all. My boyfriend has one that he will use on occasion, but I don't know, it just doesn't fit right.
[39:13.000 --> 39:24.000]  My, the only mouse that I have on my desk right now is a very poor man's attempted to gaming mouse from Mac Ali from like, I don't know, 2004, that somehow is still working.
[39:24.000 --> 39:38.000]  It's just a four button mouse and a, and a scroll wheel that I used to use for World of Warcraft of all things because you know, you have to do something in college. But I've been, I've been a trackpad user pretty much since since the original magic trackpad came out.
[39:38.000 --> 39:48.000]  I mean, I was on a laptop for most of college and up until I got hired at Mac world in 2010 and when they hired me, they're like, oh, you get an iMac.
[39:48.000 --> 40:00.000]  Do you want a mouse or a trackpad and like trackpad because that's all I, that's all I'd been, I'd been using aside from the occasional gaming and that's, that's what I like. I like swipe gestures and even the mouse with its tiny little swipe.
[40:00.000 --> 40:11.000]  Just, just did not feel comfortable to me. And I feel like the original magic mouse didn't even have like expose or, or mission control support, like it could two finger swipe between Safari windows.
[40:11.000 --> 40:19.000]  But it couldn't do any of the really cool things the magic trackpad could, so it always has felt kind of hamstrung to me in comparison to the trackpad.
[40:19.000 --> 40:34.000]  Like Apple was really only having it to throw a bone to the users who still wanted a mouse to come with their machine, their desktop Mac, but I, especially with the new features of the, this generations magic trackpad, it just feels like the trackpad blows the mouse out of the water.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  Like this, this is what you should be using with an iMac.
[40:37.000 --> 40:48.000]  I agree with that. I mean, I'm sure there are other people who are just so used to a mouse that they, I'm sure that's why Apple hasn't gone all trackpad and why the magic mouse still exists and is a thing.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  But I do, I, that is the other thing I do have at my desk. I have a magic trackpad.
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  I can't say what I love it. I have the old one. I don't have the new one. I have the old one that takes the double a batteries.
[40:59.000 --> 41:11.000]  And I don't use it all the time, but I have it there because for certain tasks in certain apps, it's, I find it nicer to have that. Like if I'm editing an image or something like that, it's nice to have it and be able to zoom in.
[41:11.000 --> 41:35.000]  And for me, I use mission control so much because I got used to it on the, on my tiny laptops that being able to forefinger swipe and get to the desktop and move around and all of that is second nature to me, and especially with El Capitan adding in things like swipe to mark his red and mail, that it just, it just makes it more of a compelling feature for me.
[41:35.000 --> 41:50.000]  Now that force touch is added, I'm still rocking the, the jelly roll, the jelly roll magic trackpad with the AA batteries, but the idea of force touch being able to do different things in the apps right now.
[41:50.000 --> 42:02.000]  It's very, very limited because third party app developers really haven't taken advantage of it at all because the trackpad's only been in the, in the MacBook, which only a small subset of the population owns.
[42:02.000 --> 42:11.000]  Now that, that trackpad is now potentially on potentially compatible with every single Mac in the lineup that runs OS 10L Capitan.
[42:11.000 --> 42:23.000]  Every single Mac in the lineup that has Bluetooth 4 and runs OS 10L Capitan now has the power of force touch and seeing what it can do just in a couple of different apps, you know, even just a quick time player, the demo,
[42:23.000 --> 42:37.000]  both in the retail stores and when they were demoing the MacBook trackpad is the press, press a little bit to fast forward and then press really deeply and you can fast forward up to, you know, 300 times and then you can lift your finger a little bit and use it like a gas pedal.
[42:37.000 --> 42:49.000]  You know, that's, that's a cool proof of concept, but I feel like especially pro level applications, design applications, drawing applications, photography, force touch is going to be a big deal.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  Yeah, I agree. I, I, I'm tempted by that.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  I've you seen that there are people complaining, I know a Neil Dash tweeted a lot of people.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  Have you seen the charging? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Okay. So yeah.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  So here's the charging port. Go ahead.
[43:06.000 --> 43:14.000]  The charging port, it charges by all these new devices. If you don't, if you're not familiar, that one of the big changes in all three of these is the no longer put batteries.
[43:14.000 --> 43:21.000]  So now, does Apple make anything you put batteries in anymore? Maybe the remote, no, because the remote's lightning. Yeah.
[43:21.000 --> 43:33.000]  The new remote for Apple TV is like, I think I think we have gotten away from AA batteries, which I am thrilled by because I have so many useless, slowly dying rechargeable batteries.
[43:33.000 --> 43:43.000]  I, I did that a couple years ago. I bought a whole bunch of rechargeable batteries and it was good when Jonas was a real little kid and was using all sorts of toys that took them.
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  It really, I really don't regret it, but no, but they, they, they lose their efficacy.
[43:48.000 --> 43:59.000]  Oh, it's so, it's so bad. I have a serious, I probably have 12 or 14 and it's gotten to the point where I don't know which ones are almost are really poorly charged and which ones are still kind of new.
[43:59.000 --> 44:06.000]  Right. Because once you've charged them, they're all good. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. There's, I wish that they like like turned a rotten color like.
[44:06.000 --> 44:15.000]  Yeah. Exactly. Slowly, slowly turned like eggshell yellow or something weird like that. Yeah. My, my trackpad, I'm lucky if my trackpad and my keyboard lasts a day.
[44:15.000 --> 44:24.000]  If I had been smart, what I would have done is maybe like gotten in a habit of like, marking them or something. Yeah. Like a tally mark like with Sharpie.
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.000]  Every time I charge the, this battery, do a tally mark and you can see which ones you've done the most, but anyway, I have sort of.
[44:29.000 --> 44:41.000]  You don't need to do it. But now I've gotten off, I've gotten back to just using like door cells, you know, and then I feel guilty about it though. I really do because I know that, you know, that it's sort of a rough thing environment. Yeah.
[44:41.000 --> 44:54.000]  Well, I don't know. Is Philly one of the places in, in Boston, you can't throw them away. Like you have to dispose of them in a special place. So if you use a non rechargeable battery, at least in, in my house, it's very much like either.
[44:54.000 --> 45:03.000]  It goes in a bucket where we're like, yeah, we'll take this to the special recycling department someday. And then it just sits there in your house forever and ever just kind of gathering dust.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  And Philly, we take them to sporting events and throw them at the opposing.
[45:07.000 --> 45:17.000]  That sounds like you guys. It's like, like peanuts, except they're a little bit more, more potential of explosion if you've set them on fire. Yeah.
[45:17.000 --> 45:26.000]  So the thing with, so that here's the thing that is a minor design controversy is that the new magic mouse has, I think, the exact same.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  When it's sitting on a desk, it looks identical to the old one has the exact same profile.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  As different feet, according to the design.
[45:35.000 --> 45:43.000]  But I don't think they look different. I think that there, there's, you know, Stephen Levy at, at back channel on medium.
[45:43.000 --> 45:54.000]  Had a great behind the scenes talk with the, the team that made these things and they talked about how they somehow with the weight being different from the new battery.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  That they had to redesign the feet to make the click sound right.
[46:00.000 --> 46:09.000]  But anyway, the complaint that people have is that the lightning port is on the bottom. So if you want to charge this thing, you have to turn it on its side or turn it upside down and stick a lightning port in.
[46:09.000 --> 46:21.000]  And therefore, while it's charging, you cannot use it as a mouse. And what everybody seems to, or the complainer seem to think is common sense is that the lightning port should be at the front of the mouse.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  So that you could plug it in and use it like you would a wire.
[46:25.000 --> 46:34.000]  Just use it like a mouse. Yeah, except for the fact that I, I've seen an else mock up where it's like, yeah, just have this little hole in the front of the mouse.
[46:34.000 --> 46:45.000]  It'll be fine, except I can just, I can just see five different people at Apple being like, that is the most tedious thing I've ever seen in my life. And some, I don't know, it just.
[46:45.000 --> 46:55.000]  For on top of that, we should also mention the fact that this mouse does not take a extremely long time to charge two minutes supposedly gives you nine hours.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  It gives you a day. So the idea.
[46:58.000 --> 47:08.000]  So you get charged if you came to work and your mouse was dead, you could charge it and you would have to wait to start using it, but you could just use that as like your minute to get your standing.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  Yeah, yeah, or standing point.
[47:11.000 --> 47:21.000]  And then by the time you've got your standing point, your, your Apple mouse, your magic mouse to would be charged for the day.
[47:21.000 --> 47:36.000]  And it does give you the other thing too is it, it gives you just, you know, if you, for any of you who haven't used these peripherals, they do the system is in touch with them and when they get low, you do get a warning on screen and it's not like an emergency warning.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  It's like, you know, you're going to want to charge this thing.
[47:39.000 --> 47:48.000]  Yeah, you know, I'm actually, I'm kind of mad that the ports are on the back for the magic trackpad and the magic and is it a magic keyboard or is it just a keyboard?
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  Oh, let's see, it's just called a keyboard.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  Yeah, no, it is a magic keyboard magic keyboard magic all the way down.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  I think that that might be a new name though because it's the magic trackpad too and the magic mouse too, but it's just the magic keyboard.
[48:03.000 --> 48:11.000]  Magic keyboard because it has the new not butterfly mechanism, but different scissor mechanism than previous keyboards.
[48:11.000 --> 48:25.000]  Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm in tune with the standing notification idea where why don't, why aren't all of the ports on the underside and then then it just forces you to get up off of your desk while you're charging your accessories.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  Sorry, your accessories literally are going to stop working unless you get out of your seat.
[48:30.000 --> 48:44.000]  I didn't, it seems, it seems subversively funny to me, but I don't, I honestly don't know what the, what the fuss is about.
[48:44.000 --> 48:59.000]  I think that Apple first and foremost wants to obviously design functional things, but also design accessories that are going to look nice and the worst, the worst thing I think in the world would be to give you a wireless mouse and then be here, we're going to make it so that you can absolutely use it as a wired mouse because how many?
[48:59.000 --> 49:07.000]  I don't want to say stupid idiots, how many stupid idiots are just going to plug in their peripherals and then just keep them plugged in the entire time. Oh, I don't want to charge them.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  They are, you know, things always burned down.
[49:10.000 --> 49:21.000]  I think that if the existing profile of the magic mouse had a flat front, then they might have just put the port there.
[49:21.000 --> 49:31.000]  But it's the fact that they're clearly happy with the profile of the magic trackpad where the front and back, you know, it's, it's exactly symmetric.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  And it has, there is no, there is no where for it to go.
[49:34.000 --> 49:45.000]  So anybody who's asking for them to put the port so that you can use it while it's charging is asking for them to redesign the whole mouse.
[49:45.000 --> 49:52.000]  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it's, it doesn't, you know, it just does not seem like a problem.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  And I also think on the other hand, I think exactly what you said, I think it might even be deliberate.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  It may actually be that they want to discourage people from using it while charging.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  Yeah.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  But I'm not quite sure then why they didn't do the same with the keyboard and the track.
[50:06.000 --> 50:24.000]  Yeah, which is, which is my, my wonder. No, I honestly think that, you know, if you're, if you're talking about technology that went into these peripherals again, the mouse feels like the odd man out here where the trackpad gets forced touch and all of this new and the keyboard is completely redesigned and should type better.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  And the mouse is, it has lightning now.
[50:28.000 --> 50:41.000]  You know, I know that there was design work going that went into the mouse because of Stephen Levy's excellent article and also I know that even if something looks identical, Apple spends a lot of time on it regardless.
[50:41.000 --> 50:52.000]  But I do think what you were saying is absolutely correct where in order for them to put a lightning port on the front and make it not look like a piece of crap, they're going to have to redesign it.
[50:52.000 --> 51:07.000]  And if they're going to redesign the mouse, then they might as well redesign it in such a way that they can also put force touching it, which I think right now is probably too challenging given the curvature of the mouse and the, you know, current initial limits of force touch.
[51:07.000 --> 51:26.000]  So I mean, it may eventually happen, but I just, I think they ran up against time and hardware limitations to actually put that together. And it's like, well, do you want a mouse that has a port on the front of it for slightly easier charging, or do you want force touch on your trackpad?
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  Pick one. You can only have one.
[51:29.000 --> 51:37.000]  And I'm guessing the majority of people are going to say, yeah, we'd prefer force touch on the trackpad. Why do we care about a charging port location?
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  Yeah.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  The other thing last thing I'm about these three peripherals is the price.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  Yes.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  And this is very classic Apple. The keyboard is 99 bucks. Of course.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  Which is a lot of Ricky, but the track is 79 before.
[51:52.000 --> 52:00.000]  I think so. The trackpad is $129. And the, the mouse is, how much is the mouse?
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  59 69 79.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  So mouse, the mouse and the keyboard are the same price.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  No, the keyboard's 99 99. The keyboard used to be 79.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  So the mouse moves up to the keyboard's price.
[52:12.000 --> 52:20.000]  The keyboard's 100 bucks and the trackpad is a very, a very quintessential Apple number, $129.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  Yeah. So hot.
[52:22.000 --> 52:36.000]  Yeah. I mean, I, I understand the technology in the, in the trackpad, at least forced, forced touch to me seems like the kind of thing where you might need to charge a premium for it based on all of the mechanics that are under the hood.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  It's not just a mouse, but it's still $129 for a slab of a metal.
[52:41.000 --> 52:48.000]  The Amazon basics three button USB wired mouse is $69.
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.000]  What's the, Amazon basics wireless mouse. Now it's expensive. That's $11 before.
[52:55.000 --> 53:05.000]  So if you want a mouse, I seem to remember that in previous iMac versions, you could choose between the mouse, the keyboard or the trackpad and they wouldn't charge you.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  And now they up charge you 50 bucks.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  Oh, if you want to go from the mouse to the keyboard.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  You mean to try that mouse to the trackpad. Yes, the mouse to a keyboard is 50. No.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  Oh, yeah, that used to be like that used to be.
[53:18.000 --> 53:32.000]  You choose your, choose your poison and now they're actually discouraging people from going to the trackpad, which seems like such a, seems like such the wrong thing to do if you want to get more people using force touch and more people comfortable with a trackpad.
[53:32.000 --> 53:40.000]  Or, and, or you could get both the magic mouse to and the magic trackpad to for $129.
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  In case you wanted multiple peripherals, or you could get a wired Apple mouse for no money.
[53:44.000 --> 53:58.000]  Yeah, I think you're right. I think you're right to the, it fundamentally comes down to the fact that force touch is the, or 3D touch whatever we're calling it is the new, you know, hotness and it's, you know, it probably is more expensive.
[53:58.000 --> 54:09.000]  I really doubt that it costs $129. Yeah, that much more, you know, but multiply it by Apple's standard margin and maybe, you know, maybe it is the right price.
[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  But it really does, it is one of those remaining things that stands out from the Mac and the commodity mouse market.
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.000]  As I sit here and look at this, you know, I just opened up an Amazon dot com tab and just type mouse.
[54:24.000 --> 54:32.000]  It's like you can find, here's a Logitech for $21, $22. Yeah, if you want to, and, and you know what, the high quality mice, that's the funny thing.
[54:32.000 --> 54:42.000]  It's like Rick has a high quality, silent wireless gaming mouse on his, on his desk that I'm pretty sure he paid maybe $70 for.
[54:42.000 --> 54:49.000]  Yeah, I'm sure you can, but it's, you know, but even that, that's less than the price of the Apple Magic Mouse too.
[54:49.000 --> 55:01.000]  Right. I mean, here's one. It looks like something from Iron Man, YCC team 4000 dpi 10 button LED optical USB wired professional gaming mouse.
[55:01.000 --> 55:08.000]  Why does a gaming mouse deep dots per inch? Well, it's for the, it's, it's the dots per inch is the sensor, the laser. Oh, oh, yeah.
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  It actually is pretty important. Oh, yeah.
[55:11.000 --> 55:26.000]  I've never, I've never heard that term because I am a very casual mac gamer, but that's, that makes sense. I'm not a gamer. I haven't played a game on my Mac and I think over 10 years, maybe longer, but I'm very sensitive to that because that's why I use my old mouse with the ball because it has a really high D.
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  Precision. Yeah, absolutely. So I can jack the speed up with the mouse. So I, I, I, that's one of the weird things I know about the gaming world.
[55:33.000 --> 55:52.000]  But anyway, all these mice, like $7. Oh boy, but Apple can do it. That's the thing is that they, I mean, these, the peripherals, I know a Renee's been going to the store pretty much every day to try and get them and they're limited supply every day and every day sold out, sold out, sold out.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  So people are buying these horrendously expensive peripherals. Yeah.
[55:57.000 --> 56:10.000]  Magic mouse. Well, I don't even know if it's, it is expensive. Yeah, there's no way they're around it. I don't know that it's too expensive though. I'm not complaining about it, but it's, you know, it's the price you pay for, you know, Apple's cutting that stuff.
[56:10.000 --> 56:32.000]  For not, for, for, for no batteries for lithium ion batteries in a keyboard and a trackpad, I would pay, you know, what $129 for that set. If I was buying it to upgrade to my current Mac, yeah, I would do that in a heartbeat because anything that requires me never to use batteries again is worth that up charge. And for such is worth that up charge.
[56:32.000 --> 56:47.000]  I do hate that they're referring it to force touch as force touch on the Mac and 3D touch on the phone. That is driving me crazy. Well, I think I've asked about it and it's one of those questions that they have a prepared answer for that doesn't really answer it. Yeah.
[56:47.000 --> 57:08.000]  But they're ready for it. But I think translating it from their non answer to a real answer is, I think it's too full. I think one, they were calling it force touch everywhere and then they decided that I think they kind of bought into or at least recognize the arguments that people have that it sounds like it could be a little creepy or something.
[57:08.000 --> 57:23.000]  That there's other, you know, there's other ways to interpret those words that that aren't a positive connotation. And I think secondarily they've talked themselves into that not just renaming it 3D touch everywhere.
[57:23.000 --> 57:38.000]  Because I think force touch is sort of binary where it's either a regular touch or a force touch and that's it and 3D touch has, I just read it.
[57:38.000 --> 57:54.000]  Because it measures degree of touch. So like just the one way that Apple exposes it currently in iOS 9 is with the peak and pop where there's two levels of touch and I just read an article, I guess I should try to find it in a show notes.
[57:54.000 --> 58:18.000]  I think it's an article where somebody was playing with the APIs and effectively a developer could probably get six levels of touch if you wanted to. And where you might want to use that maybe in a game, you know, some kind of game where you have six levels, maybe for acceleration in a driving or racing game, maybe in some kind of musical app where you're playing the force touches is trying to get music out of it.
[58:18.000 --> 58:28.000]  And you can pretty much go like one to six. And that's 3D touch like it had, you know, and force touch though is either just it is a force touch or it's a regular touch and that's it.
[58:28.000 --> 58:41.000]  Yeah, well that but that's what it is on the watch and that's what interests me about the desktop is that the force touch trackpad on a MacBook is not you press or you're not like it does have it does have degrees of sensitivity and layers in it.
[58:41.000 --> 58:49.000]  But they're still kind of playing with that idea. Yeah, I don't know that the APIs are there on the Mac that maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. I think they should just call it 3D touch over.
[58:49.000 --> 58:59.000]  Yeah, I like 3D touch. I think 3D touch is appropriate. And the interesting thing, it's funny that developers can only access six levels of of pressure in sort of apps.
[58:59.000 --> 59:12.000]  Because Peter Skinner from 10.1 did a, of course, an initial test for the pressure sensitivity and drawing apps and he was able to detect over 400 400 potential levels of pressure sensitivity when it came to drawing alone.
[59:12.000 --> 59:24.000]  So there's a lot, there's actually a lot of functionality built into that little screen that maybe isn't quite exposed to developers for regular apps because maybe it just doesn't make sense to have that kind of finite pressure.
[59:24.000 --> 59:33.000]  That that's so many levels of pressure that the average human is not going to understand that they've shoved through 50 to get from step one to step two.
[59:33.000 --> 59:43.000]  But from a drawing perspective, that's actually really exciting. And one of the things I kind of want to play with once we get the the new, I almost call it the force touch trackpad.
[59:43.000 --> 59:59.000]  Once we get the new magic trackpad, I'm really curious to see how, you know, if if pressure sensitive drawing is going to be enabled if it's something that the that the magic trackpad can do or whether they're going to just limit it to the iPhone for this this time around.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Yeah, well, what do you think you would do the drawing with though?
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I mean, you could do it with a thing, see the thing, the interesting thing for me, at least on a on a Mac, you could use a stylus arguably because that that glass is now so big that it kind, it almost reminds me of like a whackum bamboo bamboo tablet like a really early 512 levels of pressure sensitivity tablet.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  But what would be cool for me is using it in something like pixel meter or light room where you use it to shade or to like to do color correction in various levels where you don't need the specific pinpoint, pinpoint accuracy if you were just drawing very tiny lines.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  But if you're, you know, color correcting or if you're removing splotches or anything like that, being able to have levels of pressure like this is how this is how much I want to, you know, this is how much color I want to take away in a desaturation.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Yeah, the pressure is more important than the, than the pixel precision.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Exactly, exactly, at least in these early days, at least in certain tasks like that, yeah, exactly.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  And even the pixel precision is not too bad when you have zoom at your disposal and I can very easily see you pinch and then you use one finger to sketch.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  That's what I've been doing on the on the phone and it's been working really well.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  All right, let's take a break and I will thank our second sponsor and it's our good friends at automatic. They dispel it the regular way, automatic. And what is it? It is really cool. It is a connected car adapter. I call it a dingus.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  It plugs into your car's diagnostic port now every car made I think since like 1997, but somewhere around there has one of these it's a standard port.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  It goes across manufacturers. Your car has one. You just find out where it is on your car somewhere underneath the dashboard. You plug this little dingus into it.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And it's exactly the same port that like the mechanic uses when you take your car in the shop and like you if your car's dashboard says you need like service a one.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  You could just use automatic and it tells you exactly what that means.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Because I have an app here's how you you plug the thing in the car. Then you don't have to worry about it anymore. Then after that you just use the app and it communicates it with bluetooth between you and your car and it tells you everything that goes through there.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  So any kind of like engine light warning or something like that automatic will explain in plain English what the heck is going on.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Whether you just need to know oil change whether you're due for some kind of bigger service whether something is failing. It gives you a log of your trips. It keeps track of your parking location.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  So if you if you have a you know if you don't have like a garage or something like that and you forget where your car is.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Automatic knows where your car is every single time you park it. It even can call emergency services in the case of an accident.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  It scores you on your driving if you want it to so you can set goals for fuel efficiency and stuff like that and will give you hints and tell you when you're you know when you're going over your limits and stuff like that.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  The new thing they have this year and it was already cool just doing all that stuff. The new thing they have this year is they have an app store for automatic and they have over 20 apps available and that lets you use your cars data in all kinds of ways.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  So for example they've got integration with Nest. So you can let your thermostat know when you're getting close to home. You can say when I'm you know five miles away from home do this with the temperature in your house or 10 miles wherever you want it to be.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  You don't have to do anything you set it up and then it just works like that. It's amazing. It really seems like the future.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And they've got integration with if ttt that's if then than that. If this than that really great web service which you should check out on your own anyway for hooking up all sorts of nerdy stuff but then you can make your own recipes and do all sorts of custom stuff based on this really really cool.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Long story short if you have a car you really want this it's amazing this sort of thing should be built into every car but it's not but it's pretty awesome that it works with everybody's car.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  It's a hundred bucks normally which is a great deal and there's no service fee you don't pay like ten bucks a month or whatever you just give them the hundred bucks you get the dingus and then you own it and that's it.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  But even better than that you could save twenty percent off that's twenty bucks get it for eighty dollars and it ships into business days and they have a forty five day return policy that's how confident they are that you're going to like it so buy it for eighty bucks with this code go to automatic dot com slash the talk show and get yourself this automatic dingus if you haven't gotten one already really cool.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Anything else on the uh... the peripherals no i think i'm i'm good they're girls after all i was thinking i it's it seems a little silly because it's only October and i'm not like a big year and review sort of person i usually don't do anything like that but i think we're at the point now though where we kind of know everything that apples done for twenty fifteen i mean the we're still waiting coming yeah we you know the iPad pro is obviously.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  A huge thing that's coming it's probably the blooming right it's the biggest literally.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Well biggest iOS device it gets us not bigger than a twenty seven a time back but it's you know it's probably the biggest hardware announcement of the year and we know we don't have it in our engine.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  But we know it's coming.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  I think you know i think the apple has shown all of their cards and it actually is to me you know it's as much as like for the year or two prior. There were a lot of complaints that apple was sort of.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Silence and innovating yeah wasn't innovating you know Phil shillers can't innovate anymore my ass thing at wwdc it was obviously frustrating to them.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  I don't see it it's one of those things where I feel like they you can complain about it when they're quiet for a long time but then when they have a busy year it's nobody really says wow they've really done a lot this year but they've done a lot this year.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  And spectacular amount when you really think about all of I mean they launched a entirely new product.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  So look just how just how much work goes into creating solid software and they really did I feel like make solid software this time around on both iOS and OS tenant doesn't feel nearly as as funky to me right off the line we got new iPhones.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Apple TV I forgot about that still to come to I that's looming end of October early November.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  I also want to emphasize that as we record this I do not have an Apple TV I worry that somebody's going to go oh you know Gruber says you know he's only waiting on an iPad probably must have an Apple TV and now do not I do not.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  But that's coming and the other two really big things to me are the photos the new photo integrated photos that launched yeah in iCloud photos and Apple music right and so there's these two things that you know music and your photos and videos that in 2015 Apple has introduced entirely new and you know not necessarily in both case in either case seamlessly.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Yeah but it they've certainly laid the foundation for the future of how people in the Apple you know customers in the Apple ecosystem are going to manage their photos and music.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Absolutely and you know I did a lot of work on both of those topics right as as they were coming out and as as the year has progressed they you know Apple has been very very good about listening to customer feedback and implementing.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  You know implementing changes or fixes or bug you know bug fixes to make the experience better you know I think about the initial iCloud photo library and the new photos app I couldn't turn around on the Internet virtually turn around without seeing someone being like how dare you this sucks I miss aperture I'm moving to light room everything is terrible.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  And now they're I feel like quite a few people are using photos or they're using Google's photo service or they're using you know they found their photo service or they're willing to give photos a try and there's there's no big calamity.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Apple hasn't lost someone's entire photo library there's no there's been no insanity there there's a little insanity over Apple music.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Yeah let's get photos first because I feel like it was the smoother launch. It was and I'm really impressed by it I really am I you know it works really really well for me there was one time early on with a photo on my iPhone where I had it let me see how many photos I've got in there now just to put a scale on.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  I can compare. You probably have more I'll bet I've got 16,956 photos and 237 videos. Yeah you might have me beat on videos but I'm pretty sure I have you beat on photos.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  I don't have a lot of videos because I used to store them separately. I do have videos in here never mind I'm guessing most of that was recently shot but 26,896 photos, 855 videos and three items.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  I don't actually know what items are. I had it I had a situation early in this summer or no maybe it was at the point where I upgraded to iOS 9 beta on my on my phone and it was a beta so I this is why I didn't complain about it publicly but I had a situation where there the count wasn't the same across all my devices it was slightly off.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  And I figured it out that it came down to a photo I had taken on my iPhone about two weeks prior and which I had edited.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And I forget if I only edited it I did it on the phone and I forget if I use the photos app on the phone to adjust the color or something or if I used like after light or one of those third party apps that let you modify images on your photo role in place without making a copy.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  But it was edited and for whatever reason it was not able to sync that photo to.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  To iCloud so I emailed it to myself so I'd have a copy of the edited version then I deleted it and then everything got caught up and then I took the email photo and put it back into photos.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  So one time and it was with a beta so I'm not complaining and ever since then it's it has been great.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Yeah well I and I think you know comparing this a little bit to the Apple music rollout.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  The beta process was really important for this being able to have the months where they're like yes this is beta.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  We definitely want people to come play and in the beta so please if you're interested but this is a beta service and please be advised this is a beta service and please back up your photos.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And once people I think realized well first of all knew that going in and also we're able to figure out oh this is the difference between storing all of your photos on your device and optimizing storage and this is what this app gets me that aperture or light room does not.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  They had more time to kind of figure all of that out I too had I had one really bad photos experience and that was mostly I had at this at the time that photos was released or initially sort of announced.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I was really excited about this because my photo library had been spreading across four different computers.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  And I thought at one point I had it all localized on the 15 inch I Mac but as as time went on it kind of more and more got over to my or 15 inch MacBook Pro as time went on it became more on on my old 21.5 inch I Mac and a little bit on my on my.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And I was just saving like giant folders of iPhone images every time my iPhone would get full I just dump everything via image capture into a folder and just shove it into Dropbox so it was like there's some canonical version of my photos somewhere.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And when I went to merge everything into photos one my MacBook Air library wouldn't sink and eventually I just had to create a new I had to create a new library and pull down all of the.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Photos from the cloud and then upload everything it was trying it just got into a terrible loop where it was trying to download and uploaded the same time and they just.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  You know essentially the you know the virtual pipe was clogged so nothing could get anywhere and it's just set uploading forever. But again once I like that was a very simple troubleshoot and I talked to Apple almost immediately got that fixed and once I got that fixed no problems.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Everything's great.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Yeah the other thing that really works well and it sounds simple and I know there's other services that do this I'm not saying Apple has invented anything I'm just saying that at scale for all of the people who use iCloud photos.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  It seems to be working well is the way that like you can say whether or not you want all of your photos on this device or not or you would just want the thumbnails and pull them down over the cloud as needed to save space.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Yeah and having gone through the the again this is I'm not complaining it's you know it's a great it's great that I get access to the iPhones and stuff beforehand but I set up an awful lot of iOS devices every year because I get new iPhones and then I buy my own iPhone.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Having set up on my own iPhones for personally use a lot and over the last month or two it's worked really really great where it's obviously they're not you know 16 or 17,000 photos even the thumbnails are not there you know a minute or two after you unlock.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  But you know within a very reasonable amount of time they are and it's it's to me really impressive and it solves a problem that we've you know had for a long time.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And not like in it just in every day to obviously most people don't necessarily have a job where they're taking tons of product photos on maybe and then uploading them to one machine and maybe need access to them on another machine at a later point in time.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But that kind of workflow I feel like is universal for different documents and Apple seems to have really done a great thing with photos where I can again snap a screenshot or snap a snap a photo of like an on Apple watch doc in three seconds later it shows up on my Mac where I need to upload it to.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Or CMS for for our website and that it just it makes it easier I don't have to worry about where my photos are because I know that like okay they're all in the cloud and then I have a backup a physical backup on one of my computers and then I have a double backup on in Dropbox.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  But that's it's just it feels really nice the one the one niggle that I have with optimize storage is that I do wish that your favorite album was automatically stored on device like I wish there was an album that you could just be like this album needs to be stored locally.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Because the the annoying thing of like tapping something that you want to share with somebody and then seeing the the doubt the slow download icon and realizing currently iCloud photos is limited to wifi to download any photo.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  So if you want to get an old photo from you know 1996 or something that you have stored chances are if you haven't looked at it frequently it's not it's stored up in the library it's not stored on device if you have optimized on.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  And if you're not on wifi you can't download that and so all you can see is this really blurry picture even if you're just looking at you want to just browse photos while you're stuck on the airplane or something.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  That that's a little frustrating but it's not you know it's not a deal breaker it's not necessarily something where I'm like Apple how could you.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  It would be nice to have like to have a space of like these photos will always stay on my device. I always want to look at these pictures of my pets.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  At least the default is that you favorite them and then the favorites are on the watch. I don't know if you can also is there a way that you can manually specify a different album.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  On the Apple watch but it is albums only and favorites is the first option.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  So out of the box that's what happens. Yeah I'm looking at it right now. Yeah sync album favorites.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  But anyway long story short I think it's really been a good year for photos and I am really intrigued to see where they go going forward because it's one of those things where I feel like it's the same thing as I trying to get everything across the board to go red.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Where you need all of these things in place first and some of the stuff you just have to wait for and I feel like being able to say it doesn't matter you know like if you have a standalone.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  You know camera and you then hook it up to your Mac and you import them into photos a week or two later you forget what you took the photos of you just know you took a photo of you know.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Your relatives birthday party and the fact that it's just there on your phone what even if you didn't take the photos with your phone is great.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  I'm really interested to see though if if what they do like for next year with photos.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Is start beefing up especially the Mac version to be more of a prosumer photo editing tool.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  I'm hoping so.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  I hope so too and my concern though is that because everything is everywhere and that they're non-destructive that the Mac what the Mac version of photos can do isn't limited by what the Mac can do but it's limited by what iOS can do.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Yeah well I mean there's already some disparity there because the iPhone has of course non-destructive third party edits and the Mac did not get that option for app extensions until this fall and even then there those are limited to device.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  So if you if you edit something on your iPhone say with like the Pixelmator expense extension for iPhone and then you import it are you open it up in the Mac.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  You can't open it with the Pixelmator extension for Mac inside the photos app it you either have to you can revert it so you can take off all of the edits.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Or you can add a top of it but you can't once you've changed those sliders if you open it up in the Mac and start to apply new new more edits you you lose the previous ability.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  But if you but if you just look at it you do see the edits.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Yes you do so I guess that's one way to do it where you know the Mac could gain a lot of built in.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Serious stuff and then when you open it up on the iPhone you'd see them but then if you try to edit it it would warn you that you either need to make a copy of it or revert or something.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Yeah exactly.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  I could live with that I'd you know and that's sort of I think the best we can hope for.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  Yeah well I mean I wouldn't necessarily rule out a pro version of photos but I do think there's enough there are enough things to make improvements to in the initial app where I think the initial app is a very solid one over lease.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  But there are still there are definitely there are definitely tools that a that would be great for a pro zoomer app or a you know a consumer leading to like doing the slow stepping stones.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  They've already done a great job even with the editing menu of making potentially you know severe and and expansive color correction available to somebody who doesn't really know much.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Well you just start with this slider from light to dark and then you can drop it down and it becomes more expensive and more in depth and then you can add extensions if you really want to play around and oh I've messed this up it's just reset button away.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  So huge year for photos in my opinion Apple music the next thing this is the part Apple music to me still it confuses me.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  How am I supposed to use it okay so do you do you want to use Apple's catalog of so like would you like to access Apple's catalog of artists.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  I guess I think what I need to do here's what I think I need to do I think for safety sake and I have backups but I think I need to make like an entire copy of my music live.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  I think that's why which is largely ripped but I have had the match service for you know ever since it came out.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  And make a copy and then I have all of my ripped stuff that I've had for I don't know 15 years now and then just go with Apple music.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  So what I would suggest if you're starting from scratch and you're you want to go into Apple music you make a copy of your library.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  For that new copy of your library if you want to start just absolutely clean what you can do is create that new library and then I think there's a check box that allows you to.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Add songs but keep the linked locations absolute so which is to say like if you have all of your songs packaged in your original iTunes music library.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  When you add them to the second library it doesn't create a second copy of those songs it's just it's it has a provisional or I forget what that's called a symbiotic link.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  From from the original library to your to your new library in alias basically similar to to the way again to compare to photos similar to the way that when you imported your I photo library to the new photos it didn't make copies of everything it.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Use sim links to have what looks like two copies of it but both folks pointing to the same stream of bytes on desk exactly so you can you can fold do this and then once you have that second library you turn Apple music on for that library and your Apple ID it's tied to your Apple ID that's that I think one of the most important things that people kind of overlook.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  It's tied to your Apple ID you turn on Apple music and the big difference between having just Apple music as your Apple music service of choice or having iTunes match or having both of them together.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Is that Apple music alone gives you access to apples catalog so you can stream any of their songs or their artists it lets you play songs that you yourself own as well as the Apple music catalog on any of your devices up to ten.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  But when you or if you cancel that service that streaming on extra devices thing goes away and all of those songs that you've streamed or downloaded to another device gets deleted whether or not you own them.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Extra auxiliary devices and all of your Apple music catalog goes away so you're left with just the original songs you had on your original computer.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  You're able to stream or download your songs that you own to any other computer that has your Apple ID, but when you download those songs on to an auxiliary computer those songs stay there forever whether or not you cancel out iTunes match or not they are forever on your auxiliary computer unless you delete them.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  So if you just use Apple music and you cancel iTunes match then your collection the songs you own that you stream or download to other computers will show up as Apple music tagged if they can match to that catalog and if you cancel Apple music those songs on those auxiliary computers will disappear.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  If you want them to retain whether or not you choose to keep Apple music then that's when you keep the two subscriptions running concurrently.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  So you have Apple music and iTunes match.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Do you think it makes sense you have both do you still have both?
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  I still have both in part because I'm testing a million things but no I I have both because I have a canonical music library on my iMac.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  But I still I will download some things to other to other computers and I don't want my you know the my local music library on an auxiliary computer to vanish if I decide to cancel Apple music because then I would have to go and re you know re import everything onto an auxiliary computer or I'd have to re enable iTunes match and that seems like a like work.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  And it's like twenty five dollars to never have to worry about that work again yeah I can I can pay twenty five bucks a year yeah twenty five bucks a year is like underneath my.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  I give a shit threshold yeah exactly the fourteen ninety nine a month for the family plan of Apple music is I want to make sure we're actually listening to this.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Yes exactly it's like this is actually this is a bill this adds up to a significant amount of money per month.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  I like despite all of the insanity with Apple music and I really do think that the difference between the I the photos around the photos roll out and the music roll out is that music didn't have a beta period with people.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  And if they had had a beta period with enough with a couple you know a couple hundred and like even five ten thousand subscribers would be enough to hash out most of the terrible bugs they saw like the fact that Apple music or Apple music and iTunes match users were seeing their songs matched as Apple music that was a bug that was fixed within the first forty eight hours.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  But despite it being fixed in the first forty eight hours people went crazy over for about a month and a half. Yeah that's a really keen observation.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  I really think it's that's that you know that I photo or photos had a beta and they worked out these kinks and music was like all of you go sign up for this free service now for three months and they worked out the kinks like on the fly and it really.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  And honestly because it was free they really could have just said three free free free free three month trial and this is our beta period this summer is our beta launch off period for Apple music that's what I mean.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Looking at beats one I listened to beats one a lot in the early days in parts because I was writing about it but in part just because it was it was such a curiosity to me.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  As someone who hasn't listened to terrestrial radio in about twelve years it was such a curiosity and such an interesting like high brow can you make this work. But but beats one was very much in their initial two months and even I mean that interview with same low.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  That he gave recently at the BBC are you basically like we are figuring this stuff out by the seat of our pants this is very much a beta for us and we won't know exactly what beats one is or how it fits into the overarching theme of Apple music for about a year like we need this time to build it we built the station in twelve weeks we need this beta period.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  And so they like that side was very very honest and straightforward even on the air being like we're just trying this out let us know what you like let us know what you don't we can you know we want to work with you we want to be your station.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  And and the rest of Apple music was very like this is how it is this is Apple music enjoy Apple music. How do you think it's going now that the for everybody who signed up right away the three month beta or not beta but.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  The trial yeah reading your mind the trial the three month trial is over and people got the notices like hey you're going to get charged unless you cancel. How do you think they're doing now it's hard to say because I don't think they've announced anything no and I don't think they will for a little bit.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  I do think that probably fifty plus percent canceled but I don't actually think that's a bad thing. I think that they need to do a little bit of retooling and they.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  anticipate them with.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:39.240]  engine is really pretty good, and Beats One is really fun, despite not being a terrestrial
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:40.240]  radio person.
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:45.320]  I will tune into that because it almost feels like being in an office as a work-at-home
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:48.280]  person, where it's like, oh, they're people occasionally talking.
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:51.920]  And they're talking about interesting music-related things, and it's not like the daily
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:58.560]  local news in your area, and it's not something so depressing as NPR to get your stomach
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:28:59.560]  and nuts.
[1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:03.760]  It's just kind of light fun, interesting content, and good music, you might not have
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:04.760]  otherwise heard.
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:08.760]  So, I think there are quite a few people who are still kind of hanging on and have
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:15.480]  gotten addicted to certain aspects of the service, but for the wide audience, Apple needs
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:19.440]  to put a little bit more work into it to really make it launch off.
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:24.800]  And one of the biggest things they can do is revamp iTunes on the Mac, because right
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:35.080]  now it's still a mess, is the polite word, I could say much more horrible things, but
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:36.880]  I will decline.
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:41.960]  But, you know, the music app, the new music app, and iOS 9, people are still complaining
[1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:44.680]  that it's messy, but it's less messy.
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:47.800]  It's slowly like they're iterating on this and being like, okay, this is what works.
[1:29:47.800 --> 1:29:53.080]  This is what doesn't, it turns out we don't need a more button that's going to last
[1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:58.520]  15 links worth of more button, we can work around this.
[1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:04.720]  iTunes still feels gigantic and bloated and uncomfortable, and it's just awkward in weird
[1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:05.720]  ways.
[1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:08.560]  I think I told you this story over the weekend, where you were here in Philly for the
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:09.560]  Coca-Cola.
[1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:10.560]  For Coca-Cola, yeah.
[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:12.520]  And we hung out a little bit.
[1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:18.480]  But long story short, my wife had a new playlist she made on her Mac, and she just wanted
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:21.360]  to send it to her phone and go to the gym.
[1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:26.600]  And the way the new iTunes works, it's like you, there's like this weird dot, dot,
[1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:27.600]  dot button.
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:31.920]  And you select the playlist and then you go to the dot, dot, dot.
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:36.680]  And then it just says send to device, and then there's her iPhone and she'd click it,
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:38.760]  and it which seems like that's what should do.
[1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:42.240]  And then if you Google, you know, search for how you're supposed to do this, it says that
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:45.920]  it's how it's supposed to do, and it never just, it just never showed up on her iPhone.
[1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:52.560]  And long story short, I think that solution was to turn off Apple music on all of her devices
[1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:57.960]  and just do it the old fashioned way and connect it to USB and then the dot, dot, dot, send
[1:30:57.960 --> 1:30:59.360]  to this phone worked.
[1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:00.360]  Yeah.
[1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:01.360]  Because you're actually sending it over to another connection.
[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:02.360]  Right.
[1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:03.360]  It's a gymnast.
[1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:04.360]  It's such a mess.
[1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:06.760]  But if you have Apple music turned on, it's like even having a tethered connection doesn't
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:07.760]  make it work.
[1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:08.760]  That's even worse sometimes.
[1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:12.800]  Like some of my playlists show up, some of my playlists don't, it's still at this
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:13.800]  day.
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:17.240]  Apple, this is the, that's the kind of stuff that could have been really valuable during
[1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:21.920]  a three month beta test of like, man, hey, there's some playlists problems.
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:22.920]  Let's actually find out.
[1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:23.920]  And I find it really interesting.
[1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:30.760]  I don't know if you saw this week, Apple launched an Apple music help Twitter account
[1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:32.640]  with office hours.
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:33.640]  No.
[1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:34.640]  Yeah.
[1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:39.560]  So Apple, Apple music help for people's Apple music questions and they have office hours
[1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:45.080]  from I think eight to six either GMT or yes, yeah, I need to actually look.
[1:31:45.080 --> 1:31:51.560]  But, but I saw that and I, I, I quite literally laughed out loud because that's, you
[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:55.520]  know, that's what I have been doing for the last three months on and off is being people's
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:32:00.280]  like, Apple music guru on Twitter and now I can be like, go talk to them.
[1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:01.760]  They've actually built this thing.
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:05.840]  Like I, other, I will happily help you stump, like try and stumble through your problem
[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:06.840]  with you.
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:11.200]  Um, but, but maybe the people who have access to the engineers can fix your more high
[1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:16.200]  level problems like the fact that pressing the like button refines your tastes, but also
[1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:20.160]  there's no way to save a song you like as a favorite without adding it to your library
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:26.400]  and then it goes into the mass of like the bottom list pit of library.
[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:27.400]  That's really awesome.
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:28.400]  Yeah.
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:31.880]  Uh, the top pin tweet, in fact, answers my question.
[1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:35.160]  It is create a playlist with your favorite songs in Apple music.
[1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:36.160]  Huh.
[1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:37.160]  There you go.
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:40.760]  Uh, obviously, obviously it's a frequently asked question.
[1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:47.920]  Um, anyway, but isn't that, that is sort of a fun, you know, again, not to really pretend
[1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:53.080]  like it's New Year's already, but and, and get all sanguine about and, and talk about
[1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:57.400]  2015 in the past tense, but among other things that have happened this year, there's, you
[1:32:57.400 --> 1:33:06.400]  know, it has been a sort of, uh, quote unquote new Apple, you know, things that Apple
[1:33:06.400 --> 1:33:07.640]  does that they wouldn't have done before.
[1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:13.040]  And I think having a Twitter account with, uh, office hours is it filed out under
[1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:14.640]  things Apple wouldn't have done before.
[1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:15.640]  Yeah.
[1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:21.040]  The new giving, uh, given Stephen Levy access to the, the design team and actually having
[1:33:21.040 --> 1:33:25.480]  like people's, not only people's names associated to what they were doing with people's
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:29.720]  faces and pictures inside, it was just one of those things where I'm like, I would have
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:31.600]  never seen this story five or six years ago.
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:35.360]  And I'm really glad to see this story and hear more about the, the inner workings of
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:36.360]  Apple.
[1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:41.040]  I'm really glad that Apple is reaching out, um, for help and support beyond just the, you
[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:44.400]  know, the standard disclaimer, go, go see Apple care.
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:48.760]  I'm glad that developers are getting more of a voice on Twitter without worrying that
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:49.760]  PR is good.
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:52.840]  You know, the full wrath of PR is going to come and eat them alive and then they'll never
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:54.560]  be seen or heard from again.
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:58.960]  It's, it's a really interesting sea change and then you, sorry, go ahead.
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:03.560]  Well, I, one of the things a lot, I would like to see it and I've been on this for you.
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.480]  I haven't talked about it frequently, but years ago, I don't know, five or six years ago,
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:13.240]  uh, I did a, a talk at Macworld, back when Macworld San Francisco was still a thing.
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:17.560]  It was like the, my top 10 things to be, you know, things to look at, you know, for the
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:20.760]  future, things to worry about Apple, you know, top 10 list.
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:28.440]  And one of them was that, uh, I wanted Apple to go back to having put, letting, letting the
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:32.960]  people who make the software put their credits in the about box.
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:33.960]  Yeah.
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:41.360]  Like the whole reason about boxes were there, that it's a thing in Mac apps is, um, originally
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:45.880]  it was so that the people who made the things could could get credit for them.
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:53.080]  And it went away when Steve Jobs came back in 1997, 98, um, and now the about boxes are
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:57.840]  almost useless and it's standard across all of their software, where it just has the icon,
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:00.760]  the name of the app, the version number and a copyright.
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:01.920]  And that's it.
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:05.440]  It's almost like why do it, you know, why it's just doing a really get out of it is a version
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.440]  number.
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:11.240]  And the idea that, that, that Jobs gave back in 98 was that Apple was in bad shape and
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.240]  their talent.
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:14.880]  They did it, the one thing the company had, the company was in bad shape, but it had lots
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:15.880]  and lots of talent.
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:20.080]  And he was really almost pleasantly surprised by the amount of talent, you know, engineering
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:26.360]  and, and the fact that Johnny Ivan, his team are already there, um, well, yeah, it was like
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:27.920]  an anti poaching thing.
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:31.800]  But it's, that is such the way the world works today.
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:36.560]  Nobody needs to, nobody who's a recruiter trying to poach Apple employees needs the about
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:39.400]  box to figure out who wrote this app.
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:40.400]  No.
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:44.520]  You know, and, and there is obviously, I mean, if you, you know, I don't use LinkedIn,
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:48.560]  I mean, thousands and thousands and thousands of Apple employees are on LinkedIn.
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:52.840]  I mean, there's all sorts of, you know, and, and, you know, I'm sure that the best recruiters
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:54.240]  don't even need to do that.
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:55.240]  They have others.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:56.240]  They know it.
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:57.240]  Right?
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:02.360]  Like the difference between the current world today and the world where Apple employees
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:08.000]  got to put their credits in the about boxes for the apps that are in the system.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.440]  The difference in the amount of talent that gets poached is, I think, effectively zero.
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:14.440]  Yeah.
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:15.720]  It's not a good reason to do it.
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:21.080]  And I think that being able to sign your work to me, it's, it's just an important part
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:25.480]  of, you know, it's just like a point of pride.
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:26.480]  Absolutely.
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:27.800]  Well, it, it's also nice.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:33.760]  I mean, I, you know, Apple employees, I know Apple employees and former Apple employees.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:37.920]  And when you're working on something that's secret, all you can really say is, I work
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:41.840]  in this team and, and you don't want them to say anything more because you don't want
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:42.840]  them to get in trouble.
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:47.520]  But after a, a feature ships, you know, they can say like, hey, I worked on that.
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:52.400]  That was, that thing in the keynote, that was partially my, you know, something that I did.
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:54.400]  And I, I, I like that.
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:59.480]  I like be, again, like you said, I like the idea that our friends and, and Apple, you
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:03.760]  know, people who work at Apple can sign their work and can be proud about their work
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:08.880]  because they spend so long and under such levels of secrecy to get it right and get it
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:14.000]  perfect and, and just make a great product, whether that's hardware or software.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.920]  And when it comes out, like, I love what Tim Cook has been doing at the last couple of
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:20.040]  events, which stand up if he worked on this.
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:21.040]  Right.
[1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:24.680]  Like let's acknowledge these people and not have them hide in the shadows.
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:28.720]  Jobs did that too sometimes, but, um, I don't know, I just feel like letting, letting, you
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:33.080]  know, making the about boxes relevant again, as just, you know, the credits, let it be
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:34.320]  the credits for the software.
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:35.320]  I don't know.
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:39.440]  People like that kind of fits with the, the way that Stephen Levy's, uh, behind the scenes
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.480]  of the new peripherals got to, you know, talk to people who actually designed them and
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.880]  worked on them and, and stuff like that.
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:46.880]  Yeah.
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:49.000]  It's, it's very cool.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.960]  Um, let me take another break here and thank our next, uh, friendly sponsor and it is
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:54.960]  our good friends.
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:59.880]  A long time sponsors of the show, mail route, R O U T E, some people might pronounce
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  that mail route.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:01.880]  I don't know.
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:02.880]  I say mail route.
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:04.920]  Um, here's what they do.
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:09.960]  They are email nerds who do nothing but email.
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:14.480]  That's, and what they want to do is they want to handle your email.
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:21.120]  They've created, uh, the first cloud based email filtering solution years ago, then they
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.320]  sold it to Microsoft.
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:31.880]  Uh, then the same team went back and they created a really clear product, just as one thing.
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:37.800]  It is an innovative and effective spam and virus filtering mail filter.
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.360]  Um, here's how it works.
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.000]  You have your own email server, your domain name and you get your email.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.960]  You keep running your own email server.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:52.280]  But what you do is you take your DNS records and you point the, the ones for email at
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:57.600]  mail route and then mail route, you point them at your regular mail service.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:38:59.480]  So mail route isn't actually hosting your email.
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  It just goes through mail route first, then on to the email server you already have works
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:06.480]  with any mail server.
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:07.480]  It doesn't matter.
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:14.040]  All mail route does is filter out all of the crap spam the virus stuff.
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:17.200]  I mean, Mac users don't really have to worry about the virus stuff, but spam is an enormous
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:18.520]  problem.
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.440]  And mail routes spam filtering is I would argue second to none.
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.320]  It is really, really amazing.
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:31.320]  Uh, if, if spam filtering, for example, is the only reason that you use Gmail instead of
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:35.760]  hosting your own email, you should really take a look at mail route because it is super effective.
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:41.880]  I mean, like almost nothing gets through, uh, and they have really cool stuff very configurable
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:45.880]  so that you can get, for example, you can get like a daily report just to email to you
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:52.400]  at the end of the day with here are the ones that mail route was it's like, maybe about,
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:57.160]  you know, 99% of spam, they can just nuke and they're 100% certain that this is spam.
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:02.000]  If there's anything that they are like, mmm, I think this is spam, but maybe not, they,
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.880]  you can get a report every day and then you see it and you say, wow, that wasn't spam,
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:10.040]  you know, click it, you go there and mark it as not spam and it goes through to your email
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:12.640]  and then they'll remember that and it keeps going.
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.640]  Really, really easy to set up.
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:18.320]  The hardest part is probably just, you know, figuring out, you know, going to where your
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:23.280]  domain is registered and getting the DNS records pointed the right way, but they have all
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.160]  sorts of stuff to help you get that going.
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:27.160]  It's easy to set up.
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:32.160]  It's reliable and it's trusted by really, really, there's large corporations, large universities,
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:35.960]  entire universities with tens of thousands of students and all the mail, all the stuff
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:41.280]  goes through mail route first because they're so good at what they do.
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:42.920]  Really is an amazing way.
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:47.600]  It's, it just returns email to like the old days when there was no such thing as spam.
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:51.720]  They support all sorts of nerdy stuff too, if you're like a sisad bin and these things
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:56.360]  mean anything to you, they've got LDAP, they've got Active Directory, they support TLS,
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:02.520]  they support mail bag, bagging, outbound relay, everything you would want from the people
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.560]  handling your email.
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:05.560]  It's so great.
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:07.800]  It's so simple, really great price.
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:11.200]  It just, it just takes all the junk out of your email and then you don't have to worry
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:13.360]  about spam anymore.
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:15.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Very easy.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:21.040]  Mail route.net, it's not net because they're like a networking service.
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:28.080]  Mail route.net slash TTS for the talk show and with that code, you will get a free trial
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.840]  and 10% off for the lifetime of your account.
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:40.360]  So use that slash TTS URL and you save 10% for as long as you use them could be decades
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:41.360]  to come.
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:48.800]  My thanks to Mail route, go check them out if you host your own email server.
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:50.120]  What else do you want to talk about?
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:51.120]  Gosh.
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  We can talk about the Facebook bruhaha.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:55.520]  Ooh, that's a good one.
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:58.640]  If you're talking about the same thing I'm thinking about, which is the thing that you're
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:02.640]  talking about yesterday with the Federico pointed this out.
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:04.080]  Do you want to summarize this?
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:05.080]  Yes.
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:11.160]  So Facebook eats a lot of an iPhone's battery and it's traditionally eaten a lot of the
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:16.640]  iPhone's battery, which is why at least I more we recommend turning off background processes.
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:22.960]  But in iOS 9, we were able to see not only is Facebook eating a lot of your battery and
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:27.880]  you can see in terms of the battery screen and percentages, but you can now tell what specific
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:33.800]  processes Facebook is using and it turns out even if you have background processing turned
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:41.240]  off, Facebook can still eat your battery with background audio and what Federico, Matichi's
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:48.320]  theorized and based on some very clever sleuthing on his part, is that Facebook is likely
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.160]  playing silent audio to keep the app running an active in the background.
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:59.800]  And I don't know if that is helpful for them on the outside too, but it's insane to me.
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:02.800]  It's such a feel so dirty.
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:10.000]  It feels downright malicious and honestly, the thing that occurs to me is it doesn't really
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.600]  matter what they're doing if it's like they're, check out this tweet and this is a tweet
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:16.600]  from someone.
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  I actually checked with this guy.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:23.200]  I don't know his real name is Twitter account, it's just his first name Chad, but he tweeted
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:24.200]  a screenshot.
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.720]  He added me and Jim Dowrumpel and Phil Schiller.
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:34.720]  And this is his usage, this is his usage from, I guess that's an iPad, right?
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.480]  Yeah, that's an, let's say an iPad mini.
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:48.320]  His battery usage on iOS 9 was 75% of his entire battery was consumed by Facebook and it
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:50.600]  was only two minutes on screen.
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:55.520]  This is so that if you haven't looked at this, if you go to the usage in iOS 9, Apple's
[1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:02.600]  really gotten this to a very fine grained breakdown and the number one thing to remember
[1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:09.320]  is in most apps, the thing that kills your battery the most is making the display go.
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:13.320]  And so like knowing how much of your time, so now that they tell you how much of the time
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:18.640]  was on screen and how much was in the background, it can really tell you like, hey, maybe
[1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:25.440]  it's actually okay that tweet bot used 38% of my battery because, wow, I was on it for three
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:26.440]  hours.
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:31.160]  And yeah, you're like, all right, all right, I understand.
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:35.520]  And so for example, if you sit there and read a book in I book for a long time, it makes
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:40.280]  sense that it's going to use a lot of battery, even though that is obviously not a CPU-intensive
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:42.600]  application because it's powering the screen.
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:49.360]  This guy sent me this screenshot, Facebook, two minutes on screen, 15.9 hours in the background.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:56.040]  It used up 75% of his iPads battery and he has the Facebook cassette not to be able to
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:44:58.920]  use background updates, which is insane.
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:00.320]  That is insane.
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:11.680]  And it actually to me, I honestly think it shows who holds the power in the Facebook Apple
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:12.680]  really.
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:17.120]  If you think of Apple as this mighty corporation and they think of the App Store as this
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:23.760]  powerful tool that they wield with their own under discretion, I actually think that this
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:26.040]  makes Apple look bad in a week.
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:31.040]  It's almost like because Facebook is so essential to what people use their iPhones for.
[1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:38.920]  I almost every account that single most use their party app on iPhone that I almost wonder
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:42.160]  whether Apple knows that they're doing this and feels like they can't do it.
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:43.160]  What are they going to do?
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:45.320]  Kick the Facebook app out of the App Store?
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:47.120]  Well, unfortunately, it harms them.
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:49.800]  I'm looking at my battery for the last seven days on this.
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:50.800]  This is crazy.
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:54.680]  58 minutes on screen for Facebook, 3.2 hours of background.
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:55.680]  There's no reason.
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:57.560]  And do you have background updating turned off?
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:45:59.760]  I have it turned off for Facebook.
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:05.320]  So it's, you know, this is mind-boggling to me and I don't know, I still don't have
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:09.480]  a Facebook account, so I have not encountered the first hand.
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:14.760]  It does not inspire me to change after all these years to change my mind and maybe sign
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:15.760]  up for Facebook.
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:16.760]  Yeah.
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:17.760]  And that's a sad thing.
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:20.840]  It's like I was off Facebook around 2010.
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.360]  I was done with it and I only went back because the people that I play roller derby with,
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:27.680]  that is the roller derby community is on Facebook.
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:30.840]  It's not a Twitter-based place.
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:36.560]  So I only use Facebook for derby and even so, it ends up murdering my battery.
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:40.080]  And I totally understand that and I know how much of stuff like that.
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:43.800]  I was just at, I don't know, we can talk about it in a bit, but I was at a screening of
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:48.120]  the Steve Jobs movie last night over at University of Pennsylvania and it was, I thought
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.720]  it was like a press screening, but it was really more for like, it was like students
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:51.720]  could get in.
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:53.080]  It was mostly just college kids.
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:57.240]  And they have like a, it was like put together by like their, their film club or something
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:46:58.240]  like that.
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.840]  And the pre-announcement like, hey, welcome, you know, glad everybody could be here.
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:05.480]  It was like, how do you get involved if you're a student, I want to get involved with
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:06.480]  the club.
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:07.480]  It was Facebook.
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  Yeah, Facebook group.
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:13.680]  You know, I'm sure that there are 10,000 other examples of groups where if you want to get
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:16.920]  involved in staying touch ass to be Facebook, so I understand that.
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:21.760]  And not everybody can be an antisocial hermit like, but this is criminal.
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:29.480]  This is absolutely insane that they're working around, you know, people who are specifically
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:34.840]  saying, I do not want you to update in the background and they're doing it anyway by cheating.
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:39.720]  I mean, if it doesn't matter whether the only way they're doing it is Federico's theory
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:45.840]  that they're playing silent audio, which lets them stay running in the background as a separate,
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:51.480]  you know, thing from the background updating option, which clearly is not in the user's
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:52.480]  interest.
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:53.480]  Right?
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:54.480]  No.
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:55.480]  It's nobody wants that.
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:58.280]  They've said we want you to shut up in the background, just stop.
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:04.440]  And the other thing too that struck me about this is this because of the insane popularity
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:10.120]  and of Facebook and how many people use it and clearly how detrimental it is to your
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  battery.
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:12.120]  This has to be.
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:13.640]  I don't even think it's a maybe.
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:18.760]  This has to be a main reason for the stress about the iPhone's battery like that.
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:20.560]  No, the fourth, the fourth quitting apps thing.
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:21.560]  Oh, that too.
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:22.560]  Yeah.
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.880]  I would be surprised that this whole entrenched, what would you call it?
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:32.640]  The way that so many people it's a tenant of like using a smartphone where, oh, I have
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:36.640]  to force quit my apps because it'll make the thing run faster and the battery last
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:37.640]  longer.
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:38.640]  Right.
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:42.880]  On ATP the other week, Casey, let's say he was at a football game and the guy in front
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:46.560]  of him every time he would take his phone out, he'd unlock it, do whatever he was going
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:47.560]  to do.
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:51.400]  And double click the home button and force quit whatever app he'd just use and then turn
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:53.120]  the phone off and put it back in this pocket.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:55.680]  Every single time he said and it was like driving him nuts.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  But can you, so you and my thought was this is voodoo and Apple needs to stop this because
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:05.560]  it's not helping anybody whereas it must be helping people because it that way you can
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:09.360]  actually nuke the Facebook app and it wouldn't be playing the silent audio anymore and
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:12.600]  you actually would see better battery life.
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:13.600]  Yeah.
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:18.320]  So I used to use the force quit apps technique way back when I would go over the border
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.200]  between US and Canada so that I wouldn't accidentally use data usage because that you know
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:28.000]  that like that is the way to ensure that someone's not leaching in the background.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  So you'd cut everything on that.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.360]  But yeah, I mean that it seems like that's the only way to ensure that Facebook's not
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:39.240]  leaching, leaching data and looks at not even battery life data.
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:43.240]  Like you think about how much data, I don't care if the audio is silent, you're still
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:44.600]  streaming something.
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:48.480]  You are still requiring a call and it would be really interesting to compare this with
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:51.800]  also the numbers of the cellular data.
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:58.640]  But I do think you're absolutely right and that it emphasizes and it validates the force
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:04.200]  quit theory where oh well of course this is how I have to use my iPhone.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:09.720]  And I also I think that it might actively be skewing iPhone battery numbers enough people
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.800]  to use Facebook that I wouldn't be surprised if that's cutting half an hour and hour off
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:15.360]  of your battery every day.
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:18.880]  And if you're going from you know you think you're getting a phone with a 14 hour battery
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:26.240]  and you end up getting you know closer to 11 or 12, that's I mean that that it's a bigger
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:30.280]  problem than I think we've made it up to be before this.
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.880]  Yeah, I really was not aware of it but it really seems like I don't use the word lightly
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:36.600]  but it seems scandalous.
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  It really does.
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:42.280]  I think it's clearly dark matter to most people like they're not going to figure this
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:46.360]  out like just going to settings general.
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:52.840]  Yeah setting settings battery to find the usage now right right right right settings
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:57.320]  battery but people you know how many people go there I don't think it's a lot.
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:01.080]  You stumble across it occasionally you're like oh that's fun.
[1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:05.000]  The only the only app that has more I'm looking at cellular data right now the only app
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:09.400]  that has more than Facebook right now and Facebook has 420 something megabytes.
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:17.160]  I've got I've got the music at 430 and tweet bought it 551 megabytes but I use those
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:22.920]  apps probably 15 times as much as Facebook on my phone.
[1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:25.000]  That's crazy.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:28.440]  Yeah I'm looking at it.
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:31.640]  Yeah it's it's crazy.
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:36.080]  Well anyway I think that it's this is not the last we've heard of this I think that this
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:42.520]  story has legs obviously in politics but it's just great like this guy with the two
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:46.360]  minutes on screen of 15 hours at the background is crazy.
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:51.040]  Yeah and the and the usage the fact that you know it's not it's not just 75% but only
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:55.760]  he's only used it two hours like he has the time since last full charge there and that's
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:01.600]  the really like oh yeah and if you it's you have to tap it if you're just looking at
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:06.200]  it if you look at the NIH nine if you tap it and you get this little there's a little
[1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:12.520]  blue clock thing that shows you the the how long on screen and how long in the background
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:13.520]  breakdown.
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:15.600]  It doesn't show that by default.
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:21.440]  Yeah for me it's tweet bought and and safari yeah tweet tweet bought the last 24 hours
[1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:25.600]  have been maps because I've been using my phone a lot but tweet bought safari maps music
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:26.600]  Facebook.
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:31.560]  And then mail is the only one to me that has the big difference between on screen and
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:36.280]  background because I don't you know but that makes sense because I have mail set to to download
[1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:37.640]  my mail in the background.
[1:52:37.640 --> 1:52:41.240]  Exactly like mail has a good reason to download stuff in the background.
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:45.280]  And I know how to shut it off and if I told it not to if I said you know which I do
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:49.200]  it again which I do when I go to a foreign country and I'm on like a hundred megabytes
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:55.300]  SIM card and I'll just have my email set don't don't load email until I you know open
[1:52:55.300 --> 1:52:56.300]  I ask for it.
[1:52:56.300 --> 1:53:03.080]  Yeah fetching and then it does it does that it's it this is it again it's so easy for
[1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:07.040]  someone like me who who's never used Facebook and has always been sort of skeptical of
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:11.760]  the company to sit here and and complain about it but this proves my point yeah but this
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:15.680]  really does seem scandalous I mean this seems it's almost outrageous.
[1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:20.320]  Well yeah I mean I look at the look at the battery and I'm like maps you can have background
[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:24.760]  activity that makes sense mail you can have background activity music you can have background
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:29.840]  activity podcasts yes all of these make sense Facebook having background I don't know what
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:34.120]  Facebook would do with background activity like actively be useful for me maybe load more
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:39.440]  of my timeline so I can read when I don't have a data connection but I don't care.
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:43.120]  It would be curious to see what they are doing and why they're doing it but yeah you
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:48.840]  know it's I don't know it's really really interesting yeah I don't think we've heard
[1:53:48.840 --> 1:53:56.320]  the last of it but you know get get get get your pitchforks out seriously let's yeah
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:59.160]  let's an exchange on this let's cut this.
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:04.280]  Steve Jobs movie do you want to talk about yeah let me just do one I have one last sponsor
[1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:07.800]  to thank and then I will tell you about the what I thought of the Steve Jobs movie please
[1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:08.800]  do.
[1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:14.080]  And we should also talk about Elon Musk which is a good segue.
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:20.280]  So our last sponsor good friends long time sponsors of the show is harvest harvest is
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:26.720]  a beautiful business tool for tracking time spent on client projects with harvest you can
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:31.880]  start a timer from anywhere either your web browser desktop mobile device no matter where
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.040]  you find yourself working to focus stays on the task at hand you can track hours they
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:42.200]  appeal they appear in a visual time report that is designed to keep your projects on time
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:48.040]  and within budget and you can use the reporting features after you've used it for a little
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:53.600]  bit you use the reporting features and they show you which clients and projects are making
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:57.800]  you the most money which ones are making you the last money or which ones might be costing
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:02.440]  you money because the time you're putting into it is just not commensurate with what you're
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:06.680]  getting paid for it really really interesting there is these reporting features it's not
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:12.320]  just like a stopwatch that you get and gives you the time you spend on a project the way
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.400]  they integrate these into reports and let you combine it with what you're getting paid
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:20.880]  and stuff like that can really help you figure out whether you're putting your time into
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:27.360]  the right clients and projects and stuff like that and the fact that they have clients
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:32.200]  for everything mobile apps the website doesn't matter where you are whether you're at
[1:55:32.200 --> 1:55:37.080]  your desktop on a big iMac or whether you're on your MacBook or whether you're on your phone
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:42.240]  or whatever it all is just tied into the exact same harvest account and you don't really
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.320]  have to think about it it just all just it's just there when you need it and it really
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:49.960]  is super convenient to have to do to be able to do it that way as opposed to something
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:56.200]  that is say only on your Mac and then you've got to keep track of your time spent doing
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:00.680]  things away from your Mac for the project some other way and then get back and log it in
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:08.160]  forget you don't have to do that with harvest they also handle invoices gives you the
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:11.860]  bill blowers right there so you don't have to use a different tool when you want to get
[1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:15.480]  paid you don't have to use a different tool to send the invoices out you can send them
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:22.840]  right out from harvest so where do you go to get started easy their website is get harvest
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:31.840]  dot com and you get a free 30 day trial long trial but when you're done when the 30 day
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.920]  free trial is up use this code the talk show at the checkout and get this here's what
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:45.280]  you save you save 50% off your first month with that code half off with the talk show
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:49.640]  as your code so if you do any kind of freelance work if you run any kind of client services
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:53.720]  thing go check them out harvest is almost certainly a better way to keep track of your
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:57:00.520]  time than what you're doing now so before I talk about the movie let's talk about Elon Musk
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:07.440]  all right there is a thing last last week where he was who's he interviewed with a German
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:14.600]  newspaper and they asked him about apple hiring that rumors and reports that apple is hiring
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:20.560]  Tesla engineers and here's what he said Elon Musk said they have hired people we've
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:26.880]  fired we always jokingly call apple the Tesla graveyard if you don't make it at Tesla
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:36.480]  you go work at apple I'm not kidding oh Elon Musk is he speaks his mind that is what
[1:57:36.480 --> 1:57:42.080]  I will say I mean he's very very jobs in and very much like plenty of other folks we
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:47.040]  know in this in this area I don't think he necessarily meant it the way that it came out
[1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:51.280]  I think that he was probably making a comment about apples car efforts and not about apples
[1:57:51.280 --> 1:58:00.600]  engineering talent but it's still pretty pretty bad it is it is and you know it's jobs
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:06.000]  in in my opinion yes it is a jobs in thing to say which is whether it's true or not
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.680]  that and that to me is interesting that's the interesting thing because it could be that
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:16.200]  they've done internally they've looked at this and and they've decided that a lot of
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:21.160]  the people that you know engineering talent that apples hired away from Tesla we're not
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:25.920]  the a players that apple is getting the b players and the a players are sticking at Tesla
[1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:31.440]  that could be true yeah and he's willing to just come out and say it or it could not
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:34.600]  be true it could have no relative you know it could be that apples hired great people
[1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:38.600]  from Tesla but he's just saying it anyway because he's Elon Musk because it's yeah
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:46.080]  because it's Elon Musk right and it either way it works I like it I think that it's funny
[1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:51.520]  and I think that it's very confident and the thing that people have compared it to and
[1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:58.280]  I jumped in my mind immediately right away too well the next thing he said was that it
[1:58:58.280 --> 1:59:04.080]  was the the building of cars the next logical thing for them to do but then he said
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:08.400]  did you ever take a look at the apple watch no seriously it's good that apple is moving
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:13.120]  and investing in this direction but cars are very complex compared to phones or smart
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:18.600]  phones and I think he said I don't have it here in this article it's the weird thing
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:22.320]  is that the German original one is like behind the paywall and then he said something
[1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:27.400]  to the effect of that you can't just go you can just go to China and tell Foxcon to
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:34.200]  build your watch but you can't just go to Foxcon and say build me a car and the comparison
[1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:41.000]  that that brings to mind is then Palm CEO Ed Coligan back in December of 2006 which
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:44.400]  was like a month before Apple unveiled the iPhone and nobody knew what it was going
[1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:49.280]  to look like but rumors were rampant that Apple was going to do a phone and he said something
[1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:54.040]  to the effect of we've we've been working on this for a long time PC guys aren't going
[1:59:54.040 --> 2:00:00.680]  to just jump in and figure it out yeah and the PC guys that Apple just jumped did just
[2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:10.280]  jump in and figure it out the difference that I see between Ed Coligan then and Elon Musk
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:18.240]  now is that palm in 2006 was totally stagnant they were not making things that were amazing
[2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:25.000]  you were not future focused at all right they were you know they seem like they were behind
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:29.120]  here's here's the here's the quote from him in 2006 I've looked it up we've learned and
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:33.520]  struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone PC guys are not
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:38.640]  going to just figure this out they're not going to just walk in so the Elon Musk quote
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:44.440]  does seem to as echoes of that but the palm products of 2006 sucked they were terrible
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:49.160]  they were behind the times they just were not exciting whereas Tesla is doing great work
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:54.040]  they literally made the motor trend car the year phenomenal work and they're you know
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:58.080]  I the model X is not for me but even just listening to the stuff that they were talking
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:03.600]  about in the model X like that is a phenomenal car like that is a really cool car right
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:09.760]  so I actually I love it I love that he's embracing this flat out is you know brash and
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:14.640]  I think it is great for both companies like I wrote years years ago I had a piece that
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:20.120]  Apple you know Apple needs a Nikon that Canon you know makes better cameras because they
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:26.640]  have an arch rival for decades in Nikon who makes cameras that are as good or better you
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:30.680]  know glass that's as good or better in some ways you know that the competition keeps
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:37.000]  both companies better that comparison is maybe you know not that good anymore because
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:43.160]  both Canon and Nikon are sort of getting disrupted by these mirrorless cameras like the
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:48.560]  ones from Sony but don't don't take the analogy too far but anyway I just think it would
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:54.680]  be great it would be so great it's if Tesla keeps kicking right if Tesla keeps kicking
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:02:02.440]  ass in between now and even the optimistic you know 2020 2019 yeah 2019 is supposedly
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:07.560]  the goal so let's let's if the watch shipped a year late let's guess that the car will
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:14.240]  ship at least a year or too late it's probably probably looking at 2020 or 2021 yeah nothing
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:20.600]  could be better for Apple then for Tesla to keep kicking ass and be you know have a
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:26.760]  great five-year run from now until then just to keep the state of the art going forward
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:31.800]  yeah I honestly hope they do I feel like Elon Musk again is is one of these people that
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:38.240]  doesn't come around every every spring right this is he is a unique snowflake in a in
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:43.400]  a number of ways and to have him basically breathing down Apple snack not even in a
[2:02:43.400 --> 2:02:48.920]  mean way just kind of even if he just continues to make jobs and jokes and his engineers
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:53.000]  continue to make fantastic stuff that I mean that's gonna spur Apple to work that much
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.880]  harder you know innovation my ass is a is a great like grumpy grumpy this you know we
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:04.200]  hate the fact that everybody's been complaining about us not innovating when clearly we're
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:09.200]  innovating but that kind of stuff I really think that does drive them in a little bit you
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:13.560]  know I I Apple is very proud of the work that they do and the products that they make
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:20.280]  and to have somebody even even ingest saying yeah Apple's not gonna figure out you you bet
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:26.040]  the project Titan team is like oh yeah Elon Musk okay we'll show you you know it's good
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:31.480]  a competition is good and especially intelligent competition not like we're gonna copy your
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:36.680]  features and then you're gonna copy ours and then vice versa that's boring right it's so
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:43.320]  different coming from the the founder of how many different companies now well but the moat that's
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:51.240]  just just talk cars the start even talk rocket ships but just talking cars it's awesome that to
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:59.000]  hear sort of straight up you know comp competitive talk from the leader of the most innovative I
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:02.520]  don't see how anybody could deny me I don't know that they're the best cars in the world and I
[2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:10.840]  know that you know they're still very expensive but in terms of how innovative the cars are I
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:14.520]  don't see anybody could deny that Tesla is the most innovative company even just the way that
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:21.400]  they sell the cars without having dealers and selling direct innovative you know to have him
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:24.920]  take Apple on is just great the only thing I didn't like is that the next day he kind of walked
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:30.840]  it back a little bit yeah did this by Twitter so it his comments you know we're instantly they're
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.760]  all over the place I don't know I'd probably everybody listening to the show saw something about
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:39.880]  but then the next day he tweeted well here's the I'll just go back here's the the other quote
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:43.800]  he told this German newspaper was no seriously it's good that Apple is moving in investing in
[2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:50.200]  this direction but cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches and again that's so
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:56.920]  Steve Jobsian in my oh yeah because he's not gonna make phones or smartwatches and so it's such a
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:04.520]  neat rhetorical trick to just sort of say to pin Apple as a company that makes these things that are
[2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:10.360]  easy which is not easy that's the thing easy about phones or smartwatches at all it's not true
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:15.320]  it I'm not saying that cars aren't complex or they're just comp more comp they're just
[2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:19.240]  complex in different ways it's a different industry it's a completely different industry right
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:26.600]  we've got multi gigahertz Unix machines with touch screens with 60 frames per second in
[2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:31.880]  animation that are all fit into that we carry on our pockets all day right I mean if they are
[2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:37.800]  amazing devices so don't don't tell me that you know cars are another another order of magnitude
[2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:43.960]  or something but it's funny anyway on Twitter he tweeted yo I don't hate Apple it's a great
[2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:48.360]  company with a lot of talented people I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:54.520]  electronic vehicle regarding the watch Johnny and his team created a beautiful design but the
[2:05:54.520 --> 2:06:01.080]  functionality isn't compelling yet by version three it will be see so as somebody who started
[2:06:01.080 --> 2:06:07.080]  following Elon Musk I think I started following him during the initial dragon tests where they're
[2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:11.880]  they're trying to land a rocket upright yeah and just because I some people were tweeting
[2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:16.440]  retweeting stuff he tweeted and I'm like huh a CEO that speaks frankly on Twitter and that's
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:22.600]  not John Lou Gehry this would be interesting to watch he tends to do this pretty like do the day
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:28.120]  after responsive tweets to pretty much every interview he's done he did it after the yeah let's
[2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:32.920]  drop nukes on the polls comments to that that happened during this Stephen Colbert where I think
[2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:39.400]  he just he says things and then he watches the media be like oh no no you're you're misinterpreting
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:47.080]  what I said completely okay uh just just for my own personal like happiness meter I'm gonna say
[2:06:47.080 --> 2:06:54.440]  this and I don't necessarily think it's it's apologizing I think it's let me actually make sure
[2:06:54.440 --> 2:07:01.320]  you understand what I said you peons right like it's dialing it back a little you know like he's
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:07.080]  he's gonna make he'll come out though and it's why he's such an enjoyable personality and I can't
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:13.640]  help but think that having a personality like that is it really helps motivate teams you know
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:19.160]  and the companies that he works for it in the same way that it did with jobs it by by airing on
[2:07:19.160 --> 2:07:26.440]  the side of having the dial turn too high it and then and then dialing it back as necessary as opposed
[2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:30.840]  to being cautious and keeping the dial a little too low and then maybe trying to tweak it up a
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:35.720]  little bit you know you have to pick which side you're going to err on oh yeah two bucks or two little
[2:07:35.720 --> 2:07:41.880]  by airing on the side of too much I think it's it's how you do the impossible yeah I am
[2:07:41.880 --> 2:07:46.600]  absolutely I mean you can't you can't win big unless you attempt to fail big and you can't
[2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:54.040]  six yeah I don't know I'm happy with him being boisterous and ridiculous it did it
[2:07:54.040 --> 2:07:59.960]  I thought it was fun it did though it it made me and you know again just by coincidence the timing
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:05.080]  is this this part is truly coincidental it's just that the fact that Steve the anniversary of
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:11.560]  Steve Jobs's death was last week yeah four years you know every October it comes up and it hits
[2:08:11.560 --> 2:08:15.880]  a little bit and it just made me think and in some ways it's just sad and it just you know nobody
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:21.480]  wanted a guy to die so it's always sad to remember somebody you know beloved who died but with the
[2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:29.080]  the Elon Musk comments it really made me miss him because it's it Apple doesn't need somebody who
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:36.120]  can play that role but you know I mean it would have been Steve the back and forth yeah the back
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:42.200]  and forth between Steve Jobs and Elon Musk on a semi-public forum would have been glorious and
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:49.320]  going forward making cars right like as fun as it's going to be to have Apple and Tesla competing
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:54.200]  in the space it would have been more fun if if there was Elon Musk and Steve Jobs yeah
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:02.440]  so I made it did make me miss him a little bit yeah so anyway last thing I did see the the
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:09.480]  Steve Jobs movie yeah everybody's calling Aaron Sorkin but it's Aaron Sorkin written and Danny
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:17.000]  Boyle directed I can see why the Aaron Sorkin you know what all his Aaron Sorkin done
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.640]  Aaron Sorkin's yeah he's done a few good men he's done the West Wing sports night which is still
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:27.320]  one of my all-time favorite TV shows studio 60 which was not one of my all-time favorite TV shows
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:32.440]  I like that I like oh I like it yeah exactly it was flawed but had some really great moments
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:37.720]  and same thing with the newsroom and very very flawed but occasional high points and then occasional
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:47.560]  hyper low points so he has a style of dialogue and it is you either like it hate it or
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:51.320]  or you're maybe sometimes you like it and sometimes you don't but it's very distinctive
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:59.560]  and this movie is very very Aaron Sorkin he also wrote the the social network movie and
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:08.680]  the social network to me was a far more conventional movie it was you could tell this
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:14.840]  Sorkinism in the way that characters talked but it was very neutered for Sorkin like that was the
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:20.040]  first thing I ever noticed with with the social network because it feels very again there's little
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.960]  bits of Sorkin in it but doesn't feel like an Aaron Sorkin production this the Steve Jobs is very
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:31.480]  it just screams Aaron Sorkin and in ways that are good and bad and the ways that it's good the
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:37.240]  best thing I can say about it is that there's only a handful of major characters and they are
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:47.320]  all interesting and well with the exception maybe of Chris Ann whatever her last name was the
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:56.600]  mother of Lisa his first job who was sort of a sort of weird in the movie and just a little
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:04.840]  little mousey but she was but there she was she just didn't have as much dialogue and it made
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:12.040]  her a little un-sorkinish but the characters who were there were all vivid very very vivid it
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:18.360]  was not just Steve Jobs and a bunch of others it was you know a bunch of very interesting
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:24.280]  characters and the dialogue is good and the characters are coming from interesting perspectives
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:32.840]  and there's a lot of really really interesting conflict and it's entirely verbal it I enjoyed it
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:38.520]  I thought the last third drug a little bit it's bait you know I think most people know the
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:43.800]  basic gist of it it's three acts the first they're and they're all these scenes that centered
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:51.960]  around Apple or Steve Jobs product and failings 1984 is original Macintosh 1988's next box
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:59.080]  and 1998's original iMac which we just talked about an hour ago and then there's this these
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:04.120]  scenes of you know personal conflict around these events but it's not really about the events
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:11.640]  and it's not about the products for the most part I thought the third one the third act with the
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:17.720]  iMac it the scene drug a little bit I thought I like the first too much better this movie is
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:21.400]  I wonder is really here's the other half the states because I know there's a lot of people
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:25.560]  out there listen to the talk show this movie is really really going to bother you if you're the
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:33.240]  sort of person who wants it to be factually accurate I don't understand why you'd go see a fiction
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:39.800]  movie you expect it to be fact I know why people expect it to to hit all of the buttons but it
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:45.000]  was already based on a book that wasn't intact you know yeah but this takes liberties though it
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:54.280]  doesn't just taking liberties this is like the best way I can say is it it feels a lot more like
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:13:01.480]  a play than a movie and in fact I think it could be adapted to be a stage play really good yeah
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:06.360]  really easily I think the hardest part would be how to stage it because so much of it takes place
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:11.720]  on stages like empty rooms like I almost feel like the I was thinking about it as I when I came
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:16.760]  home is like maybe the way to play it would be to have the actors pretend that the theater they're
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:25.720]  performing the play in is empty and that the audience isn't there and but that's the way it it
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:30.040]  feels to me it didn't really feel like a movie and it's not certainly not a biography in any sense
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:38.280]  of the word like thinking about like I saw somebody on Twitter who tweeted that he that he wish
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:43.960]  that Martin Scorsese would do a Steve Jobs biography sort of like the aviator oh god I would be so
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:49.800]  bored like I mean Steve Jobs is a fascinating character but I just I don't feel like we needed I
[2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:55.320]  don't think we need a die of it nothing that he did was as Senate Senate cinematically
[2:13:55.320 --> 2:14:01.160]  interesting is flying experimental airplanes it's true it's true I really like Scorsese but yeah
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:15.640]  oh I it was a abdell Ibrahim Twitter account is a BDO photo who tweeted that which I thought
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:20.840]  was a keen observation if that's what you're hoping for it is not like that at all and it is not a
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:29.400]  story like the you know that like the social network was it's you know a melodrama about his
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:40.920]  personal life and with the Lisa his daughter overall I don't know I kind of I enjoyed it but I
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:45.800]  really had to let go of what I know to be factually true to enjoy it and I can really see I also
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:50.760]  can really see why his family is not happy about it at all because some of the like liberties they're
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:57.000]  not just liberties they're just total inaccuracies so just to name one and it really the movie
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.320]  really centers around his relationship with his first daughter Lisa and the way that when she
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:07.560]  was first born he denied his paternity that's all factually true we know that and and complaining
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:13.480]  about this is the knee jerk response I get when I bring this stuff up is that people think that
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:18.440]  if you're a people like me who is a fantasy of jobs want this stuff buried and we don't want to
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:22.200]  talk about it we don't want it to be out there because it's uncomfortable and it's it's ugly
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:28.440]  it's unfortunate that's not the case at all and nobody who I know who really cares about it is
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:34.200]  is saying those things and and the way that he could be almost tyrannical to work for nobody is
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:39.640]  asking people not to remember that or to sweep it under the carpet um they're just asking
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.920]  for it to be put in a context and the thing that to me I could see would be so painful it's it's
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:52.840]  is in the movie he in 1998 when it this iMac thing he still hasn't reconciled with his daughter
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:59.800]  Lisa and then he sort of does right before he goes on stage to unveil the iMac um which is
[2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:05.480]  ridiculous if you think why in the world would he be doing that like as like the PR people are
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:10.520]  saying like you know you're 30 seconds late you're a minute late you know you're you know did not
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:14.680]  it doesn't it doesn't seem like jobs at all besides if you're if you're talking about set you
[2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:21.000]  know someone who is obsessively focused over right rehearsing and all of that you know right no one
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:27.800]  gets to come near me for 24 hours right it actually yeah that's just ways and the character that
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:32.120]  Michael Fassbender plays is interesting and he's great he's what he is a great actor and it's a very
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:37.640]  interesting character but the character he plays bears no resemblance to Steve Jobs yeah it's so
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:43.000]  in short what I almost wish is is I almost wish that they had done like like something like
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:47.880]  citizen this wouldn't have sold because it's the name Steve Jobs that is selling to instead of
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:53.720]  thing but like citizen cane was a thinly veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:17:00.120]  this yeah and instead of naming the guy William Randolph Hearst I mean they had enough legal
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:05.960]  problems dealing with Hearst as is like Hearst almost got the the negative burned yeah by naming the guy
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:13.080]  what's his name Charles Foster Kane Charles Foster Kane so funny I remember the foster but I
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:17.400]  couldn't remember the Charles I was gonna say George Foster Kane Charles Foster Kane they had
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:22.760]  enough problems as is but in addition to the fact that it helped them legally it just let them
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:31.880]  take liberties that they couldn't take otherwise but in real life Steve Jobs was married to
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:38.120]  you know Lorraine Powell Jobs by this time in the early 90s and they had kids of their own
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:44.840]  and that family reconciled with Lisa at some point in the 90s and brought her in and she was living
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:52.600]  with them for a time and you know whatever damage was done early in Lisa's life had gotten
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:59.160]  a lot better and Steve Jobs had really turned around well before 1998 whereas this movie paints
[2:17:59.160 --> 2:18:05.800]  a portrait of somebody who it bears no remnant resemblance to reality at all and I just can't imagine
[2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:12.600]  right and then just the little factual things that are gonna drive nerds crazy is that like in
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:19.880]  1998 Steve was was was was was was was was was was was still bugging jobs to thank the Apple
[2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:30.360]  two engineering team at the at the iMac introduction like and I swear to god and and Jobs blames
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:41.400]  was for the Newton I'm not making this up so if things like that would bother you like like you
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:46.920]  like would would there's no way that you can get around them and just pretend that this is a
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:53.160]  totally fictional fable loosely based on somebody named Steve Jobs and Apple do not see this movie
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:19:00.520]  if you if you don't want to see Steve Jobs blame was the act for the Newton then do not watch this
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:08.520]  movie you know so as work has written a couple of plays and one one of them I saw pretty recently
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:13.720]  called the Farnsworth invention which is a story about the founding of television essentially
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:20.760]  oh right and it's it's a very very good show if you know nothing about the founding of television
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:26.840]  which is to say it it centers around a a guy named file of Farnsworth and then RCA who is basically
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:32.040]  Farnsworth and RCA were simultaneously developing television and then it it deals with basically
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:37.400]  their legal battles where Farnsworth alleges that RCA basically steals the founding of television
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:44.040]  all of that is true the height or like the the pivotal point in the script which is how the legal
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:51.640]  battle results is wildly different from the actual results of of the world like what actually
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:56.520]  happened in real life and a lot of people when they first saw the fit saw the the show were just
[2:19:56.520 --> 2:20:02.520]  kind of like what but sort can went that way because he wanted to make his point like he wanted
[2:20:02.520 --> 2:20:08.840]  he was telling a story and whether or not the story actually lined up with real logistical
[2:20:08.840 --> 2:20:17.800]  history it doesn't matter it's theater which is very much what I kind of feel like even from
[2:20:17.800 --> 2:20:23.880]  the earliest trailers of Steve Jobs again I really I wish it hadn't been called that I wish
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:28.280]  they had figured out a different title I wish that they had taken more liberties with it because
[2:20:28.280 --> 2:20:35.400]  I think a Charles Foster can't like a citizen cane version of Steve Jobs's life would be
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:41.000]  fascinating just like a Steve like a citizen cane version of Elon Musk's life would be fascinating
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:48.040]  yeah and it's not it's again because it's just these three little scenes you know surrounding
[2:20:48.040 --> 2:20:52.840]  these product inventions it wouldn't have this movie wouldn't even with with giving everybody
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:58.760]  fake names wouldn't have the scope of a citizen cane not like the epic scope but that sort of
[2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:06.200]  I don't know or just wait a few decades you know literally decades so that it's not it's not so fresh
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:13.800]  right I mean I'm at you know I remember the iMac launch I'm sure you do too it really wasn't that
[2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:20.920]  long ago not even 20 years back it's a I don't know if all the people are still like if two
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:26.200]  thirds of the people pictured in this film are still living you have I mean money ball was the same
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:30.280]  was the same issue right I don't I actually don't know the logistic like I read the book right but
[2:21:30.280 --> 2:21:36.520]  the book in the film are a little bit different in my ways but I don't even yeah I don't know it
[2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:41.480]  feels it feels weird I don't like watching biopics especially recent biopics for that very reason
[2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:47.960]  yeah I think money ball again it's weird and I do realize too that I'm intimately familiar with
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:55.480]  Apple and their products and you know at least Steve Jobs' public life and so all these inaccuracies
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:22:01.400]  jump out to me and in a way that I'm not quite with money ball because I'm a baseball fan but I
[2:22:01.400 --> 2:22:08.680]  can't say that I followed the Oakland athletics to the degree that I follow Apple but I think that
[2:22:08.680 --> 2:22:12.760]  the money I don't think people associated with it the real people and it really had money
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:17.960]  much to complain about yeah I mean I don't think Billy Bean really I mean how can you complain
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:23.320]  if Brad Pitt is playing you no exactly feel like that's that's an upgrade on every level of the
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:29.480]  world you know I don't know it's it's I I I have very mixed feelings about it it's not it
[2:22:29.480 --> 2:22:35.880]  was an enjoyable movie but it's absolutely positively wasn't had it didn't have anything to do with
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:42.680]  the actual Steve Jobs yeah or almost very little I would have been surprised if it did honestly
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:47.320]  he wanted to tell a character study and he wanted to he wanted to shape the character and the
[2:22:47.320 --> 2:22:51.640]  he's been really obsessed the last couple I want to say the last couple projects he's done with
[2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:57.960]  father daughter relationships to money ball had one you know yes yeah so I think that that was more
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:02.600]  of his like oh yeah I can write the Steve Jobs movie but I'm not actually going to write about
[2:23:02.600 --> 2:23:06.840]  Steve Jobs I'm going to write about what I want to write about yeah and fundamentally that is what
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:12.440]  this movie is about Aaron Sorkin Steve Jobs is is a father daughter relationship story yeah
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.040]  which could have been great it could have been a great movie if it wasn't titled Steve Jobs
[2:23:16.040 --> 2:23:22.440]  yeah and even in my opinion even with that it wasn't great because I thought the third
[2:23:22.440 --> 2:23:31.320]  third act was really not great yeah like the it just it just didn't ring true not not true to
[2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:37.480]  like what I know to be factually true but like it just contrived is maybe the word yeah here's
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:42.440]  my notes I were less I'm watching a melodramatic but contrived is probably a better word
[2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:47.640]  and I thought even even bordering a little bit it got a little boring in the last third it'll be
[2:23:47.640 --> 2:23:51.480]  interesting to see how it plays I'm curious to see how big of a hit it is I will say this too and it
[2:23:51.480 --> 2:23:57.320]  really made me cringe as it was a theater full of college students good crowd I mean it was free
[2:23:57.320 --> 2:24:03.000]  I think free movies go over pretty well pretty well on college's college campuses when the credits
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:12.840]  came up and everybody stood up there was a young woman right behind me she said to her friend
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:19.240]  wow if that was my dad I'd be using an android wow I swear to god that was what she said
[2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:26.520]  it because it's you know it does not paint a good picture no and I just thought oh
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:32.840]  I was like that's rough well the thing that I don't really understand is if you really wanted
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:37.640]  to tell a father daughter piece you could have done a really interesting thing skip I mean I think
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:44.040]  the iMac from a product really standpoint is a pretty pivotal moment in apple history but I you
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:48.200]  know if you really wanted to compare Steve Jobs as a father you should have done the iPhone release
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:54.280]  because that actually gives him a family that's not Lisa right it gives that you know that
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:25:00.680]  that gives him a chance to basically press the redo button on being a father and you what I don't
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:05.960]  know this is me rewriting this is me rewriting Aaron Sorkin so apparently I know better than a
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:11.640]  Emmy war ring screenwriter but I'm this is not a plot spoiler you know because that's the thing
[2:25:11.640 --> 2:25:16.360]  there isn't really much of a plot this boil I mean it's a biopic yeah and they never even get
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:20.920]  because it ends in nineteen ninety eight there's absolutely no nothing about his illness or anything
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  like that no it but it's like they can't help themselves and it's like oh come on in nineteen
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:31.560]  ninety eight his daughter was still walking around with it cassette playing walk man and he's like
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:35.640]  I'm gonna fix that I'm gonna put five hundred songs in your pocket now five thousand songs
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:39.400]  not well some between five hundred and five thousand but I'm gonna do it I'm gonna put it in your
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:45.240]  pocket because I'm so sick of seeing you with that stupid tape player oh my god and it's like
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:54.040]  oh wink wink right exactly exactly that he turns into the camera and you get a little musical
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:26:01.480]  sting yeah that's a shame I you know I I really like Sorkin he's he's very flawed as a writer but
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:09.320]  I I love I love musical dialogue and yes yeah yeah the idea of Sorkin writing jobs or at least
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:15.160]  a slim variation I just like jobs has great musical dialogue Sorkin has great musical dialogue
[2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:19.560]  this could possibly be amazing or Sorkin could fall down one of his rabbit holes and it could be
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:26.920]  yeah I do it there is good dialogue I mean again you have to be able to look out and I I am enough
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:33.560]  of a cinema fan that I can sort of at times if the movie is made by talented people I can
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:37.560]  I can disengage from whether or not the movie is drawing me in and just sort of watch it
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:41.880]  in a different way and I could do that and there are definitely good characters I
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:48.520]  have what's her name who plays Joanna Hoffman oh Kate Winslet Kate Winslet really really good
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:51.800]  I think if anybody gets any kind of award nominations out of this it's going to be her
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.080]  I think she's remarkable and it's a great character and I don't know anything about the real
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:27:03.800]  Joanna Hoffman so I can't compare it but you know I don't know but she has a super great role
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:10.600]  in this movie really well written really great dynamic over the the you know the 15 year
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:16.680]  stretch that it covers and she just it she's the reason to see the movie I think
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:20.360]  and and it's it's a great performance and really really well written character
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:25.640]  let's go well that's actually really phenomenal to hear because I know Sorkin's had trouble
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:31.800]  writing women lately oh I think that she's she's the exam it's a great great female character in my
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:36.520]  opinion number one reason to watch the movie and I can totally see why actors would want to play
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:42.520]  his characters because I really feel like you know there's a lot of me yeah yeah I feel like and I
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:51.000]  feel like I said all the main characters jobs and Joanna Hoffman and Andy Hertzfeld and WAS and
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:56.440]  although the WAS that Seth Rogan plays it again is I would say he bears less resemblance to the
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:01.000]  real WAS than then fastbenders jobs does to the real jobs he doesn't bear any resemblance to the
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.800]  real WAS not even just physically just everything about him is very different but it's an interesting
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:12.200]  character in the movie if you don't pretend that he's supposed to be WAS and especially John
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:19.560]  Scully played by oh gosh why can't I remember his name Jeff yeah Jeff Jeff Daniels who I love and
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:23.560]  he and he does so well with Sorkin's writing I mean he's a highlight of the newsroom for me
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:28.840]  yeah yeah and he really steals the show in this too and he doesn't have a huge role
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:34.680]  but he's one of the major you know major characters and he's he's really good really really good
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:43.480]  yeah so anyway that's that's my talk show review of Steve Jobs it's good you know good good overview
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:49.160]  I think I will see it I you should see I would recommend that you see it yeah I mean I'm yeah
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:56.200]  I just I'm gonna go into it as you said with with film critic eyes on and not with not with tech
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:02.440]  writer Joe eyes on right it's it's I'll bet you'll come out and another way to put it is it's
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:09.160]  exactly what you think it is yeah and it's you know disappointing in some ways but we're seeing
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:14.280]  in others if you can put aside the factual stuff if you can pretend if you can ignore the fact that
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:20.520]  most of the movie isn't actually true it's great but again it's fiction I I'm not I wasn't expecting
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:26.600]  Swarken to do a note for note biopic when he and there was announced that he was writing it it just wasn't
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:34.680]  gonna wasn't gonna fly I think that about wraps it up let me thank our sponsors this week we have

[2:30:14.520 --> 2:30:19.960]  actually not tech related or semi tech related and that Jason Snell of a former mac rolled and now
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:25.480]  six colors fame and myself and David lore who is a playwright and also Twitter enthusiast along
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:31.560]  with a whole host of other people have put together a old tiny radio theater podcast called the
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:37.160]  incomparable radio theater and we're doing season one right now and we're four or five episode in I
[2:30:37.160 --> 2:30:43.400]  think of a twelve episode season and it's been really fun lots of guest voices that you may
[2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:49.480]  recognize from the tech community and also uh you know getting cameos just left it right it's it's
[2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:56.840]  been a blast it's such a fun like uh late record late night put together Jason does magic of editing

[2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:06.920]  it's a fun little thing aren't we supposed to say it works for a fruit company he does work for a
[2:31:06.920 --> 2:31:13.080]  fruit company they may sell apples it does sound like fun I will put a link to that in the show notes
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:18.360]  and uh it seems as though everybody it seems like everybody is desperate for podcast to listen to
[2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:23.400]  because last week uh Marco and I were talking about hello internet and hello internet shot up from
[2:31:23.400 --> 2:31:29.000]  like number three on the overcast recommended list to number one passing even marco's own podcast
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:34.760]  um I don't know if that was entirely uh me and marco's doing but uh anybody's looking for a good
[2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:40.280]  podcast that does sound like fun and it also sounds like it's a lot different than the uh
[2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:46.120]  to your average tech show two people talking about this week's news uh tech show so anyway I will
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:50.360]  put a link into that that sounds great thank you serenity thank you john actually before we go i
[2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:56.840]  did want to mention uh because it just happened today i gary alan who ran i oh yeah yeah yeah he just
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:01.320]  passed away from brain cancer um which is in part why he shut down i have a waffle store and
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:06.840]  i don't know i i as somebody as a former apple retail employee and someone who religiously
[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:11.640]  checked that site for many years it it feels like we lost a good one today yeah it really does
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:17.240]  and it makes me sad i never really i don't think i ever met him uh i mean either i've certainly
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:22.680]  linked to him a lot over the years because he was the the definitive i mean what a weird beat had to
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:26.680]  eat out but i remember when he first started doing i was like that's a crazy beat but then for
[2:32:26.680 --> 2:32:31.080]  years to come it was like you know he was the source yeah and if there was nothing or right he
[2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:35.800]  didn't right and if there were new stores he wrote about him um but when he stopped writing the
[2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:40.440]  site back in march i was i just thought well all right he's done but it turns out that it was
[2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:46.360]  because he knew he had the diagnosis and he didn't want to um go public with it and have people
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:52.760]  you know making a fuss out yeah so anyway my best to anybody who knew him and any friends or
[2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:59.560]  family who knew him uh it is a real shame we should should call that out he will be missed
[2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:12.840]  you well all right thank you serenity thank you john this was glass talk to you soon
