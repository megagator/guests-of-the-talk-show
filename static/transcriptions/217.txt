[00:00.960 --> 00:04.800]  Finally. That's what you say, right?
[00:04.800 --> 00:11.520]  That's what I say. I'm the master. I am the licensee of finallys. One of the reasons that
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.600]  you're here now is that your website, kotke.org, has hit the 20-year marker, which now that I say
[00:19.600 --> 00:24.880]  it, this is the first time I've actually spoken it aloud, and it just put like a dagger of old age
[00:24.880 --> 00:32.960]  down my heart. No, I mean, it's crazy. It's crazy. But one of the things that I wanted to talk about
[00:32.960 --> 00:37.440]  to talk about with you is over the years, I've noticed many times, often commemorating
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.880]  anniversaries like the 20th or the 15th or whatever, you'll say or you'll write that you
[00:42.880 --> 00:49.600]  don't consider yourself a writer, which I think is a very strange thing to say for somebody who's
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.840]  written so much, but I know what you mean, I think. But I consider you to be an absolutely perfect
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.760]  writer. You you write what you want to write. And I feel like you're at least to me, you're conveying
[01:01.760 --> 01:09.440]  exactly what you want to convey perfectly. Yeah, I mean, I guess, I guess I would consider myself
[01:09.440 --> 01:17.840]  a blogger first. Someone who, you know, uses writing in the goal, you know, there's a, I don't
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.120]  know, maybe there's a different goal, like, like a novelist is a novelist. And they use writing to
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.960]  pursue, you know, that, you know, the goal of, of doing all the things that a novelist does.
[01:31.680 --> 01:38.880]  But I feel like my primary interest is, like, I want to share this thing with you or this thing,
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.600]  this other thing that this real writer wrote about, you know, something like, I want to share
[01:45.600 --> 01:52.880]  that with you. And, you know, I'm sort of using, you know, I write, like, I talk like, you know,
[01:52.880 --> 01:59.920]  and, and the site is very much, you know, this, the, the voice of the site is very much me writing
[01:59.920 --> 02:05.200]  an email to a friend about this cool thing that I saw. Well, it's the weird, the weird thing is
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.280]  that there is no one way to be a writer. And, you know, and I guess the idealized form, and maybe
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.520]  kids today don't feel it anymore. But at least when I was growing up, a novelist would be like,
[02:15.520 --> 02:21.280]  the top rung of the ladder, like, the, you know, the Hemingways and Fitzgerald's and,
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.320]  yeah, just name of, you know, we either historical or even current day, like, that is like,
[02:26.320 --> 02:32.480]  the pinnacle of like, indisputably, you are a writer, if you have written and published novels,
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.200]  run, move down from there. And I think as I've gotten older, I kind of think that's a little
[02:37.200 --> 02:45.760]  BS, like, and I think most, I think most novelists would probably agree, you know, that it's, it's,
[02:45.760 --> 02:52.640]  you know, that, that they might feel that they couldn't do what, like their favorite newspaper
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.720]  columnist does, right? That, you know, like, there might be novelists who can't imagine
[02:57.280 --> 03:03.200]  being Paul Krugman and having two times a week making a point in exactly 750 words,
[03:03.200 --> 03:10.160]  two times a week, every week for 15 years. Which I'm personally in awe of, because to me,
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.160]  one of the great breakthroughs of blogging as a medium is that your post can be exactly as long
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.840]  as it needs to be, whether that's extra long, or in most cases, you know, very short compared to a,
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.720]  like a newspaper column, that people just have different people just have writers just have
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.280]  writers just have different natural lengths. Right. Or like you, you know, you get used to a certain
[03:33.280 --> 03:38.560]  length, like, you know, like, I, I've thought about writing a book of some sort, you know,
[03:38.560 --> 03:45.520]  over the years, but I cannot imagine just how that would happen for me, you know, because everything
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.640]  I post is so short and so chunked up and like, you know, how can I, how can I write more than
[03:50.640 --> 03:57.280]  five paragraphs about something, you know, much less like 13 chapters or something, you know?
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.920]  Yeah, I, you know, it's like a frequently asked question for me, if I ever thought about writing
[04:01.920 --> 04:10.160]  a book, and I've thought about it in the abstract, but I've never had like an idea. You know,
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.120]  in the early, early days of Daring Fireball and trying to go independent, I had an idea that maybe
[04:15.120 --> 04:23.840]  I would write like a, like an advanced nerds book on how to use BB edit. And I could have,
[04:23.840 --> 04:29.360]  I think I had to, I had like book length, but you know, sort of like, even there, though, it,
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.040]  you know, like, like in the heyday of O'Reilly books, it's like, each chapter is really just
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.840]  an article, right? It would still just be sort of like, stringing together 10 articles about
[04:39.840 --> 04:45.120]  BB edit and calling it a bright and selling it. Right. It's not there's no, there's no grand
[04:45.120 --> 04:51.840]  narrative you have to worry about, right? Not one big 200 page or longer idea that I'm filling in
[04:51.840 --> 04:59.280]  the details on never, it's just never happened to me. I don't know. I mean, I feel like it's
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.920]  that kind of thing where it's like, you know, like people who are into books, they could, you know,
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.920]  they probably, they probably look at a site like yours, or a site like mine, and they're like,
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.200]  Oh, my God, like, this person could totally write a book. And they can see it in their mind. But
[05:13.920 --> 05:20.800]  I can't see that. You know, I can't see that. I don't, you know, I can't look at it that way. I
[05:20.800 --> 05:27.600]  don't have the experience of, of, of, you know, like, picking out books like that. You know,
[05:27.600 --> 05:31.760]  maybe it's like a forest for the trees type of thing. Like, you know, I'm so so in the weeds
[05:31.760 --> 05:38.000]  that I can't even see it. I don't know. One of the things that to me was a breakthrough and, and,
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.240]  you know, 1998 when kotke.org started, well, let's start with this, the fact that I've,
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.640]  it's never been quite comfortable to me speaking about your website,
[05:48.640 --> 05:52.560]  because the name of the site, it doesn't really have, it doesn't really have a name.
[05:52.560 --> 06:00.880]  Right. Right. Yeah, it's never really like, you know, kotke.org is the name. Most people call it
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.840]  kotke, which is my last name, which is a little weird. Right. And so when I talk about it,
[06:05.840 --> 06:10.480]  I always say kotke.org. Because if I say kotke, then I'm talking about myself in the,
[06:11.280 --> 06:15.200]  in the royal sense, which is stupid. You know, I'm not Ricky Henderson.
[06:17.600 --> 06:22.960]  But it is, it is, it does make it sometimes grammatically weird,
[06:22.960 --> 06:26.800]  but somehow feels exactly right. Because I can't imagine it any other way.
[06:26.800 --> 06:33.120]  Yeah. I mean, I've often thought about, I mean, not so much anymore, but in the early days,
[06:33.120 --> 06:37.520]  I thought about changing it. Like, oh, I should actually give it a name, you know,
[06:37.520 --> 06:44.160]  so it's not my name. Right. kotke's daily links. Yeah. To make it more serious. I don't know,
[06:44.160 --> 06:49.200]  something. Right. But it actually, it actually says like, you go there right now and the banner
[06:49.200 --> 06:54.080]  says kotke.org. And then there's a little heart, 20 years of hypertext products.
[06:54.080 --> 07:00.240]  It always reminds me of here in Philadelphia, there was, they're gone now. I think they,
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.560]  I think they still exist, but they're like in Delaware. But there was a jewelry store
[07:06.800 --> 07:12.320]  that ran commercials all the time. Anybody, any kid of our age who grew up like in the 80s is
[07:12.320 --> 07:15.680]  going to know who I'm talking about. Because they had like, they used to advertise on like the
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.680]  after school, I don't know why, like the after school rerun type shows, you know,
[07:21.680 --> 07:26.320]  like when you'd watch old Gilligan's Island or the Brady Bunch and stuff. And the name of the
[07:26.320 --> 07:33.120]  store was Robin's eighth and walnut. And that was their actual name of the store. And their location
[07:33.120 --> 07:39.840]  was eighth and walnut. And they even had a jingle. I'm not going to sing it. Maybe we can dig it up
[07:39.840 --> 07:57.600]  on YouTube and insert it here. And I often have thought about it when I've when I've thought at
[07:57.600 --> 08:04.240]  the meta level of kotke.org being the name of the site, it always inevitably pops into my head that
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.920]  the jingle from Robin's eighth and walnut, our name, our name is our address. The jingle is also
[08:09.920 --> 08:18.000]  self referential. It's perfect. I love it. It is in fact, I will also say this, it's in fact,
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.360]  where I got my wedding band that I'm wearing right now. Oh, there you go. Now they're now it's a
[08:25.360 --> 08:30.080]  coffee shop. You got to get him in as a sponsor. Oh, they're no longer there. Well, I do believe
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.400]  that they still exist. I don't want to get it. I don't want to get into it. But there was some
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.120]  kind of thing. Let's talk about the Jewish. There was some kind of family dispute, I believe,
[08:39.920 --> 08:45.920]  like where the the patriarch of the family died and the next generation squabbled over it. And
[08:47.520 --> 08:50.720]  I don't some some kind of messy thing like that. But I believe they're still
[08:50.720 --> 08:57.760]  have locations in Delaware. But and and that's the strip strategy there is that Delaware has no
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.240]  sales tax. So you could, you know, you could save money. I don't know. Right. There's a lot of
[09:02.240 --> 09:09.040]  jewelry stores in Delaware. Right? They should put that whole story in their name now. Like the
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.840]  part about like, we had a disagreement in the family. And now we're only in Delaware with no
[09:13.840 --> 09:20.800]  sales tax. It's right in the name. That's the name of the store. Robins we had, we had a family
[09:20.800 --> 09:28.000]  disagreement. And now we're only in Delaware where there is no sales, sales tax. Exactly.
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.880]  So one of the things in from the early days and going back to 1998.
[09:37.360 --> 09:46.000]  The format of a blog, it was not, it seems self evident now, but it was not self evident,
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.920]  then, meaning that you have this thing and you type a new post. And then on your homepage of
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.320]  your site, that most recently thing that you posted is at the top. And the next time you post
[09:58.320 --> 10:07.120]  something, it gets pushed down. And that's it. Like it sounds so simple. But yeah, I struggled
[10:07.120 --> 10:13.120]  for years. Like one of the reasons during fireball was four and a half years after Kottke wasn't that
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.040]  I, in 1998, that I wasn't thinking about, you know, having a website, it was because I didn't
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.280]  know what, how to make it. I didn't know what format if I'd, you know, I was stuck for years
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.400]  thinking about issues, but that there would be no, I do this thing. And there'd be like, you know,
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.320]  every Monday, there'd be a new issue because I came out of the student newspaper world.
[10:33.200 --> 10:41.440]  I couldn't get past it. Right. In the early, you started with what was the site oscillate, right?
[10:41.440 --> 10:47.280]  Yeah. Oscillate. Yeah. Which is sadly no longer online. It's on my hard drive somewhere. And I,
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.600]  you know, it's one of those things, like I should put it back up, but I still have the domain.
[10:52.800 --> 10:55.120]  I do. Yeah. Well, that's good.
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.360]  Well, tell me about oscillate. What was the oscillate? Cause oscillate wasn't a blog,
[11:01.360 --> 11:04.240]  but I remember it, but it's a lot harder to describe.
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.720]  Yeah. It wasn't a blog. So it was, it was, there were a series of episodes. And so like the,
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.240]  when you come to the front page of the site, it was, it was basically, you know,
[11:14.240 --> 11:23.680]  like in the olden days, back in the olden days, you know, splash pages were kind of a thing,
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.600]  you know, particularly with flash and stuff, but this was like even, you know,
[11:28.400 --> 11:35.920]  I think flash was around, but basically the front page of the site was a splash page. And if you
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.680]  clicked it, it launched a pop-up and it had that, you know, weeks or months, or, you know,
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.400]  the current episode, it was episodic and, and every, you know, every two, three, four weeks,
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.440]  you know, and then it, and then it was a couple of months and then six months.
[11:52.080 --> 11:55.360]  But every once in a while I would come out with a new episode and there would be a completely
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.760]  new splash page and completely new design for whatever that episode was. And it was,
[11:59.760 --> 12:06.560]  you know, writing was a component, photography, you know, you know, I was a 20, I mean,
[12:06.560 --> 12:16.560]  I started Oscillate in 1996, I think. So I was like 22 years old and trying to figure out what
[12:16.560 --> 12:24.560]  to do with this new medium along with everyone else. And, you know, Oscillate was, was a way to
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.840]  do that, you know, and, you know, it was also a way to try and get a job doing this stuff, you know?
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.600]  Yeah. I think that thinking back then, and, you know, I had other, some little things I played
[12:35.600 --> 12:42.080]  around with, with friends, nothing really solo, but the idea was like, for some sites, it always
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.720]  seemed like a splash page was instantly, even at the beginning, it was like, this is stupid. Like,
[12:46.720 --> 12:51.280]  if I'm going to an online bookstore, you should not show me a splash page. You should just take
[12:51.280 --> 12:59.280]  me to where I want to go. But people wanted them. And I remember a friend and I built the first
[12:59.280 --> 13:05.440]  website for Drexel's College of Design Arts after we graduated. And we didn't want there to be a
[13:05.440 --> 13:11.600]  splash page. Our idea was that when you'd go there, the main page would be sort of an overview
[13:11.600 --> 13:17.120]  of the College of Design Arts. And, you know, you could go from there, like, you know, like on one
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.920]  side, here's resources for existing students in the college. On the other side, here's resources
[13:21.920 --> 13:24.800]  for students thinking about it, blah, blah, blah. And when they were like, no, no, we need like a
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.200]  splash page, something that, you know, we're like, all right. But then there were other sites where
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.760]  the homepage was the whole site, like that was it. So it's not really a splash page. It's just that
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.720]  it wasn't a site consisting of multiple pages that needed an index. It was just like you'd go there.
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.520]  And whatever it was, would be on the homepage. And then when they'd come up with something new,
[13:45.520 --> 13:48.320]  when they'd come up with something new, they would just replace the homepage.
[13:49.200 --> 13:56.480]  Right. Yeah. I mean, you know, like Drudge Report is a good example of,
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.040]  yes, that's, you know, even probably, I don't know when Drudge started, but it's got to be,
[14:01.920 --> 14:09.120]  you know, oh, man has to be 20 years old. Yeah. How or more, right? Because Drudge was so
[14:09.120 --> 14:18.080]  instrumental in the whole Lewinsky thing. Yep. And so that was like 97, 98. And it was already
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.320]  a thing. It wasn't like a new website. So I'm going to guess Drudge started around 95 or 96.
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.960]  Yeah. Yeah. I think that's probably right. Yeah. But you know, honestly, it was like,
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.880]  you know, it was like, I'm not going to call it art because it's, it wasn't that, but it was like,
[14:36.880 --> 14:44.720]  you know, design experiments. So like the splash page idea sort of felt like it was good, you know,
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.080]  particularly in that era. And like, you know, it was my thing. So like,
[14:50.080 --> 14:56.320]  I really liked designing those splash pages because it was like this chance to use, you know,
[14:56.320 --> 15:04.480]  sort of these things that were not, that you couldn't use on like a site for a client, you
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.520]  know, you couldn't, you couldn't put these massive images up and I mean, massive for that time,
[15:09.520 --> 15:16.000]  but, you know, they probably look tiny now, but you know, just to do stuff you couldn't
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.760]  do elsewhere and just like, what about this? What about this? What about this? You know,
[15:19.760 --> 15:24.960]  it was a constant sort of like, can it do this? Okay. Yeah.
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.600]  Yeah. Just to sort of scratch that itch of, I have these very strong opinions
[15:29.600 --> 15:37.040]  of how a website should be or could be. And if I don't just do it myself and do it with whatever
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.880]  silly ideas are in my head, I'm never going to get to do it because I can see the way it goes
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.160]  with client work. It always devolves into give us this thing that's just like what everybody else
[15:46.160 --> 15:53.680]  is doing. Yeah. At a certain level. Here's a news break here from talk show headquarters.
[15:53.680 --> 16:00.320]  The Drudge Report started in 1995 as an email newsletter that he was charging, I think $10
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.000]  a month for, and then he started the website in 1997 as a supplement supplement to his $10 per
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.760]  year email newsletter. Talk about it. Talk about ideas that come around and go around
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.560]  email newsletter. Yeah, exactly. So there's the, there's the vintage on that. He's a year before
[16:16.560 --> 16:26.800]  kotkey.org. All right. So how do you get from oscillate to kotkey.org and what, and at some
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.640]  point they were both still actively maintained, right? It wasn't, you didn't really think of it
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.280]  as like, I'm going to put oscillate on ice and switch to this. It was sort of like,
[16:35.280 --> 16:43.520]  here's a new thing. Yeah. So, you know, the, what became kotkey.org started out as a,
[16:43.520 --> 16:48.960]  as an episode of oscillate. It was sort of like, okay, there is these, you know, online journal
[16:48.960 --> 16:56.720]  things that have been around for quite a while. And, you know, there are these sort of new things
[16:56.720 --> 17:02.320]  called blog, you know, well, they weren't called blogs at the time, but web logs. And, you know,
[17:02.320 --> 17:09.600]  I was like, you know, I think part of it was just that I wanted to design a site or an interface or,
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.880]  you know, a reading interface that was, that was, you know, for regularly updated content in this
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.760]  way, you know, not just sort of like, oh, I have to think of some completely different thing every
[17:21.760 --> 17:30.320]  time. It's like, I wanted to design a container where I could, you know, just write more regularly.
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.640]  You know, I think that, and that was definitely part of it. And then, you know, I did that for
[17:36.640 --> 17:42.800]  a while and it, and it, you know, it lived on oscillate in this, you know, pop-up window,
[17:42.800 --> 17:49.280]  which was very unwieldy way to, to use it. And I think, you know, I probably in a few months,
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.920]  like I moved it, you know, I moved it over to, to its own thing.
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.080]  What were you using as a CMS back then? Cause that predates movable type removable type,
[18:00.080 --> 18:07.120]  removable type, I think came out either in early 2002 or late 2001, but it was right around that,
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.120]  like right around the time when I was planning during fireball. And I was like, oh, this will,
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.120]  this will be better than the, whatever I was crazy thing I was going to make myself.
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.720]  Right. I mean, I was, I was hand coding everything. So I would up,
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.840]  so I would update the front page and then I would copy and paste that update to, you know,
[18:25.840 --> 18:33.680]  whatever archive file. And then I would FTP them to my server. I know it's not
[18:33.680 --> 18:41.440]  Zellman hand edited Zellman the daily report for years after like movable type and, and other
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.960]  things like he, he did it not because he wasn't aware of the advantages of using, you know,
[18:46.960 --> 18:53.600]  movable type or back then, what was the gray matter and eventually WordPress. It was because
[18:53.600 --> 18:57.760]  it was because he, he thought it was good and maybe he's right, but he thought it was good.
[18:58.800 --> 19:06.320]  I got hygiene to keep his like HTML editing. You know, his, his keep his, keep those muscles
[19:06.320 --> 19:10.640]  working. And I remember telling him that when he told me that it was like years after,
[19:11.280 --> 19:17.200]  you know, like, you know, like 2004 or five, six. And I was like, you're nuts. You're absolutely
[19:17.200 --> 19:24.160]  crazy. Yeah. I was like, it's like, it's like breaking down your door every time you come
[19:24.160 --> 19:32.960]  into your house and then immediately rebuilding a door. Yeah. I mean, I, I didn't switch to,
[19:32.960 --> 19:38.480]  you know, like everyone, I mean, everyone in, you know, 1990 late 99, like 2000, like switched to
[19:38.480 --> 19:43.200]  blogger, you know, and blogger blogger at the time, like there was no blog spot or anything
[19:43.200 --> 19:50.320]  like that. Blogger was an interface. You could write these posts. And then it basically,
[19:50.880 --> 19:57.360]  you gave it the FTP information for your server and it would FTP the files. Right. I remember
[19:57.360 --> 20:04.080]  that. And so I was like, you know, you know, and I have always been very particular about
[20:04.080 --> 20:10.560]  the design of, of my site and sort of, you know, for various reasons, perhaps related to my
[20:10.560 --> 20:19.360]  personality, but you know, and blogger really didn't, blogger didn't have, couldn't do it
[20:20.080 --> 20:25.440]  exactly the way that I wanted to do it. And so I, I was one of the few, I think that didn't switch
[20:26.640 --> 20:32.480]  and, you know, sort of held out until movable type was, was kind of a robust enough to,
[20:32.480 --> 20:36.800]  to be able to do everything. And then I, and then I made the jump, but later than,
[20:36.800 --> 20:42.400]  than a lot of people, I was still, you know, into the two thousands, I was still, you know,
[20:42.400 --> 20:49.360]  coding it by hand and FTPing like a caveman. And then did you backport the old, all the old posts
[20:49.360 --> 20:56.000]  from that hand editing era into movable type? I did. I did. Did you do that manually or did
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.080]  you figure out a way to automate it? You know, I probably slightly automated it,
[21:00.080 --> 21:10.480]  but it was probably mostly manual, I would say. Um, so the entirety of khaki.org,
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.800]  like from the beginning onward is still there. Like it's all, do you ever, you must know about
[21:16.800 --> 21:21.600]  this cause it's, it, it just breaks my heart on a regular basis. But like, have you ever like
[21:22.400 --> 21:26.880]  gone looking at like the, I don't even know what year to call it off at, but let's just say the
[21:26.880 --> 21:31.040]  early two thousands, but you go back and look at posts in early two thousands and see how many of
[21:31.040 --> 21:36.640]  the things you link to are now four Oh fours. Yeah. I mean, there's so much stuff. It's a
[21:36.640 --> 21:42.880]  majority of it. Even from two years ago, it's shocking how much stuff from just a few years
[21:42.880 --> 21:48.720]  ago is now four Oh four, but it's absolutely horrifying when I go back to the early years
[21:48.720 --> 21:53.680]  of daring fireball and start looking at it. And so like, I've had this long simmering project in
[21:53.680 --> 22:03.040]  my head too. Um, I guess I, you know, to be honest, pay someone, but create a tool that
[22:03.040 --> 22:08.480]  hunts down all the four Oh fours and then just pay someone to go through and replace them as best
[22:08.480 --> 22:13.920]  they can with links to the internet archive. Right? Exactly. Yes. I mean, same. We should,
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.040]  we should find, we should pay the same person to do this for both of us. Right. And then I think,
[22:19.040 --> 22:25.280]  my God, that would be so much better. And then I get terrified and thinking about how the internet
[22:25.280 --> 22:31.360]  archive is this single thread holding the entire history of the internet together. Then it's just,
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.760]  you know, I think that it's well funded and I think that they have a very, you know,
[22:37.760 --> 22:42.480]  the good plan to stay going for the future. But it just seems crazy to me that there's a single
[22:42.480 --> 22:48.320]  point of failure and it's just an independent organization. It's not like the library of
[22:48.320 --> 22:52.080]  Congress or something like that, which I'd have a little bit more. I'd feel better if
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.160]  there was somebody else, if there were like a arch rival to the internet archive.
[22:57.520 --> 23:01.760]  Yeah. I mean, God bless Brewster kale that he, you know, that he had,
[23:03.600 --> 23:08.000]  yeah, I don't know, like he had the vision to do this and like the, the, you know,
[23:08.000 --> 23:14.800]  the resources to do it as well. Um, but what are the, you know, like one of them talking
[23:14.800 --> 23:20.480]  about like old links and stuff, like one of the reasons, you know, like Amazon, I think is,
[23:20.480 --> 23:30.000]  you know, uh, increasingly problematic company for a lot of people. Uh, you know, but I linked
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.160]  to Amazon regularly, uh, you know, just books, movies, music, that sort of thing. And one of the
[23:36.160 --> 23:40.960]  things that I really like about them and one of the, one of the reasons why I still do link to
[23:40.960 --> 23:48.880]  them is that if you look at the earliest links to Amazon on cocky.org back in like 1999, they all
[23:48.880 --> 23:57.200]  still work. Yeah. Like, you know, one of the first things I linked to was like a, a DVD of office
[23:57.200 --> 24:03.280]  space. And if you go and click that link, it takes you to the DVD page for office space on Amazon.
[24:03.280 --> 24:08.000]  Even if it, even if it needs to redirect, you know, like it may exactly right. But they,
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  every time they change their system in a way that the old URL is no longer the canonical URL,
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.520]  they, they have redirects in place. I've, I've noticed that for years that the Amazon is truly a
[24:20.640 --> 24:28.400]  believer in a cool. You are, what's the slogan? Cool URLs. Uh, never changed. Never died. Exactly.
[24:28.400 --> 24:32.320]  Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, no, they, I mean, they've,
[24:32.320 --> 24:38.960]  the, you know, I think it's probably a business thing for them because like, you know, if let's
[24:38.960 --> 24:45.040]  say 10% of their links break, then like, you know, how many, how many percentage points on,
[24:45.040 --> 24:51.200]  on their total business revenue for the year is that probably significant when you look at,
[24:51.200 --> 24:59.120]  you know, what their profit margins are. One of the things I remember, um, still I, you know,
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.200]  in hindsight it, at the time it didn't seem like it was new cause I'd been reading
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.880]  cod key for years at this point, but in 2001, um, I very much remember, and this was a time when I
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.920]  was, you know, that's about a year before I started during fireball and, uh, during
[25:15.920 --> 25:27.680]  fireball started August, 2002. Um, but when nine 11 happened and I, it, you know, you were in New
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.840]  York at the time, right? Or were you not, no, San Francisco, you're still in San Francisco,
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.000]  but it obviously it affected everybody profoundly, but, and everything, you know,
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.960]  everybody was rightly obsessed with it, whether you're talking about television or newspapers or
[25:40.960 --> 25:46.000]  any other medium. But I just remember at the time I'd already had like this huge, you know,
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.200]  huge and growing collection of bloggers or journalists or, or, you know, meaning
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.880]  journalers, I suppose would be what I'm saying, whatever you wanted to call it.
[25:54.880 --> 26:01.520]  And everybody was writing about it. And I just, it, I, at one point, I, in one way I felt like,
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.200]  I wish I had, now I really wish I had already started something like this so that I could
[26:05.200 --> 26:08.320]  express myself. And then in another part of me, it was like, I don't know how I would,
[26:08.320 --> 26:14.480]  but I remember that you're writing on nine 11 was it cause it was so different and much more
[26:14.480 --> 26:22.720]  personal than what you had typically done at cocky, but it was so like cathartic to read,
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.840]  like not hyperbolic, not hysterical. You're not freaking out, but it was just,
[26:29.760 --> 26:35.840]  everybody was so emotional at the time. And it was such a weird, and it took a while. It wasn't,
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.120]  you know, it was the sort of thing that wasn't, you know, like, Oh, a couple of days and then,
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.320]  you know, back to normal. I mean, this was, you know, that was, it's kind of, I can't think of
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.840]  another thing that's happened since that even compares in terms of how, how the entire nation,
[26:51.840 --> 26:57.520]  maybe the Western world was obsessed with it for months, months and months.
[26:58.880 --> 27:02.320]  I mean, it's still, you know, it's still reverberates, you know,
[27:03.280 --> 27:07.840]  in a lot of ways, like we're still living in a world that was created that day, you know,
[27:08.960 --> 27:16.720]  and I'm not sure anybody at the time quite knew, you know, how extensive the impact was going to
[27:16.720 --> 27:24.720]  be. Yeah. I think about that too. And you and I are almost the same age. I think you're one year
[27:24.720 --> 27:34.080]  younger than me, but like, I feel like growing up in a, we grew up in a very particular era
[27:34.080 --> 27:42.160]  of the U S foreign affairs where we're post Vietnam. And by the time I sort of got any kind of,
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.680]  you know, seven, eight, nine years old, when I had any kind of vague notion of, you know,
[27:47.680 --> 27:55.440]  what the Vietnam war was like and what it meant it, it just seemed to me, and then growing up
[27:55.440 --> 28:01.040]  in the eighties, it just seemed to me that the U S was a place that used to get into wars all
[28:01.040 --> 28:10.080]  the time, but now doesn't really get into wars. And like I had one of my best friends in high
[28:10.080 --> 28:13.840]  school, we haven't really stayed in touch because I don't really stay in touch with anybody, but one
[28:13.840 --> 28:22.160]  of my best friends in high school went to Penn state on an ROTC and then, you know, joined the
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.400]  army and he's still in the army. And my mom just, you know, said we can get into Facebook later
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.800]  because I don't, I'm not on Facebook. I don't hear about things, but my mom said that he he's just
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.600]  been promoted to like a Lieutenant Colonel or a Colonel. I don't know. He's like, you know,
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.200]  really how he's like a career army guy. You know, apparently very successful. He's, you know,
[28:41.200 --> 28:45.920]  and I'm not surprised cause he was very smart and, and, you know, driven type individual.
[28:46.560 --> 28:51.360]  But I remember when, when he decided to go that way, I just remember thinking like, you know,
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.360]  good for him. I wouldn't really like the structure of military life, but it never occurred to me
[28:55.360 --> 29:01.120]  that he would be in wars for 20 years. And he's, you know, he's been to, you know,
[29:01.120 --> 29:06.880]  he, I mean, I, I can't even imagine it. I just thought that he'd, you know, be a civilian,
[29:08.080 --> 29:14.800]  or not a civilian, but a peacetime army officer, as opposed to spending 20 years as a wartime
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.200]  officer. Like that's, it was just inconceivable to me at the time. And that's one of the ways
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.560]  that 9-11 to me has truly changed. Like we just sort of accept it now. And I don't think we
[29:24.560 --> 29:31.840]  should that the U S is always at war in multiple campaigns. Yeah. I mean, you know, the thing that
[29:31.840 --> 29:39.280]  I remember most as, as a kid is, is, you know, the cold war and, you know, the eighties,
[29:43.600 --> 29:49.840]  you know, Vietnam wasn't, you know, for, for, you know, a kid who was, you know, I was, let's see,
[29:49.840 --> 29:58.560]  1984, I was 10 years old. And, you know, the cold war was this, this thing that was, you know,
[29:58.560 --> 30:02.880]  people don't really understand it. Like you get little inklings of it here and there, whenever,
[30:02.880 --> 30:07.760]  you know, like the recent saber rattling with North Korea happens. But like, it was this
[30:07.760 --> 30:15.920]  pervasive thing where it's like, holy shit, we are literally moments away from being annihilated all
[30:15.920 --> 30:20.800]  of the time. Right. And in a lot of ways, like, you know, when you're like, when you're a little
[30:20.800 --> 30:27.680]  kid, like, that's kind of terrifying. I mean, it's terrifying as an adult. But at the same time,
[30:29.040 --> 30:32.320]  you know, we weren't, you know, like you said, like, we weren't at war, we weren't, you know,
[30:32.320 --> 30:37.920]  Vietnam was in the past and it didn't, you know, there were little things here and there,
[30:37.920 --> 30:43.440]  like Panama and things like that. But yeah, you're right. Like, you know, the U S wasn't really at
[30:43.440 --> 30:52.240]  war and, you know, 9-11 did, you know, it did change that in a, in a big way. I mean, there's,
[30:52.240 --> 30:56.320]  you know, there's a lot, a lot we can say about it, but I mean, I remember at the time,
[30:57.840 --> 31:03.920]  you know, I woke up that morning and, you know, the, I think the, you know, I was on the west
[31:03.920 --> 31:11.360]  coast. So the, you know, the first tower, I think had already fallen and there were already,
[31:11.360 --> 31:17.360]  you know, there were these AIM chat rooms that were going with all of these people, like freaking,
[31:17.360 --> 31:22.880]  you know, kind of freaking out, but also sharing information. And, you know, there were the blogs
[31:22.880 --> 31:28.560]  at the time, like people were posting and things like that. And it was halfway between like,
[31:28.560 --> 31:34.720]  Oh my God, I need to turn this off. I can't deal with this right now. Like this isn't,
[31:34.720 --> 31:39.920]  like, this isn't, it's almost not appropriate to kind of
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.480]  say anything, right. But at the same time,
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.560]  something, you know, yeah, I almost felt compelled to do it. Like the,
[31:54.560 --> 31:58.880]  you know, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna be a blogger, like I'm gonna, you know,
[31:58.880 --> 32:03.120]  you kind of at a certain point, you kind of have to embrace it and like charge into the fold,
[32:03.120 --> 32:08.720]  you know? So I just started sharing all these links and information and people posting pictures
[32:08.720 --> 32:16.320]  and what was going on and, you know, tiny little, you know, videos, which at the time were like,
[32:16.320 --> 32:21.920]  you know, melting people's servers because, you know, posting these like six megabyte
[32:22.560 --> 32:25.680]  QuickTime videos and servers were getting melted because, you know,
[32:25.680 --> 32:31.040]  CNN would pick it up and point at it and like, it would melt. And CNN was down half of the day
[32:31.040 --> 32:38.560]  and CNN.com. I remember that. Yeah. And what I remember, I'll tell you my 9-11 morning story.
[32:38.560 --> 32:43.120]  I think I've mentioned this before, but not for a long time, but at the time I used to
[32:43.840 --> 32:49.200]  go, I was working at barebone software in Massachusetts and, you know, where they had
[32:49.200 --> 32:54.400]  flex time. So instead of going at rush hour, I would usually come in around 10 30 in the morning
[32:54.400 --> 33:00.560]  or so, or arrive around 10 30. So I was still at home and Amy, we only had one car and Amy wasn't
[33:00.560 --> 33:04.800]  working and she would go to the gym early in the morning and then she'd come back and then I'd
[33:04.800 --> 33:10.240]  leave for work. And so she was at the gym and called me and she was out of breath because she
[33:10.240 --> 33:14.640]  had been like doing cardio and she was panicking, but they had, you know, all the TVs in the gym
[33:14.640 --> 33:20.320]  switched to like when the first plane hit and she said, she woke me up and said, we're under attack.
[33:20.320 --> 33:25.520]  And I said, what? And she goes, New York city is under attack. And I said, by who? And she goes,
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.720]  I don't know, you know, but go turn the TV on. I remember turning the TV on and it just sitting
[33:30.720 --> 33:36.240]  there. But the moment that really gets me I just can't believe I was watching ABC and Peter Jennings
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.640]  was on and they have, you know, footage of the two towers, both had been hit and they were smoking.
[33:41.520 --> 33:49.520]  And then when the first tower fell, they like didn't know what to say. And there was so much
[33:49.520 --> 33:55.040]  smoke, you know, like you couldn't quite tell that the tower was gone because it was replaced with
[33:55.040 --> 34:01.680]  smoke and I guess ash, you know, and dust, you know, but it was obvious to me what had happened
[34:01.680 --> 34:07.120]  that the tower had collapsed, but nobody was saying it because it was so nobody was said,
[34:07.120 --> 34:11.840]  Oh my God, that that tower just collapsed. They were like, we're not sure what's happening here,
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.960]  you know, because you couldn't see the tower anymore. And it was minutes before they
[34:16.960 --> 34:21.920]  acknowledged verbally, like literally minutes as at least it seemed like it to me before they
[34:21.920 --> 34:25.200]  acknowledged that it seemed, you know, but they wouldn't even say that it collapsed. They were
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.320]  like, it might have, they could get, you couldn't see. And that's so it would, you know, that was so
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.400]  horrible that they couldn't. And then the thing that really got me and the thing that that the
[34:36.400 --> 34:43.600]  first time I burst into tears was that when they finally acknowledged that that tower had had
[34:43.600 --> 34:50.400]  fallen was, and they wouldn't say it, but they were talking around it was that if the first
[34:50.400 --> 34:56.640]  tower fell because a jet hit it and the same type of jet hit the second tower 18 minutes later,
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.520]  or however long it was, then the second tower is going to fall too. And we just have to sit
[35:01.520 --> 35:08.480]  here and wait for it. And I just like that realization, but just, I just burst into tears.
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.720]  I think by that time Amy was home and we were together, but it's sort of a blur,
[35:12.720 --> 35:21.280]  but I'll just never forget that feeling. I don't know how we got sidetracked by this, but
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.560]  yeah, I, to me though, that did, the point is that to me, when I think of nine 11,
[35:27.600 --> 35:34.080]  katkey.org is, is at primarily mixed into that. Like it's one of my, you know,
[35:34.080 --> 35:42.080]  I remember Letterman going back on the air but I just remember like never more needing to check
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.160]  your website every day just to see what you were saying. Dave Weiner too.
[35:49.040 --> 35:56.240]  Yeah, Dave Weiner, Dave Weiner was definitely like, he, you know, I think a lot of people were
[35:56.240 --> 36:04.240]  definitely, you know, following him and refreshing and that stuff. You know, and you know,
[36:04.240 --> 36:10.640]  nine 11 was one of those sort of, you know, pivotal moments, I think, in the site, like it,
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.680]  it, I mean, it basically increased my traffic by 50% within like three days and it, and it stayed.
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.240]  And, you know, it was just, you know, it was just one of those things. Like it was like,
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.000]  it kind of, I think in hindsight, I don't know, I've never really thought about this,
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.440]  but I think I do think in hindsight, like it was one of those things where it was like, oh,
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.440]  this is, this is a thing that is, you know, important to me. And I think, you know,
[36:42.160 --> 36:47.360]  at least somewhat important to other people. Yeah. Well, and in addition to the fact that
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.920]  you were expressing thoughts that I think a lot of people shared and maybe were themselves having
[36:51.920 --> 37:00.000]  trouble articulating the format of a blog was actually perfect in those days and weeks afterwards
[37:00.000 --> 37:10.800]  where there was so much else on the internet worth, you know, like linking to and the nature
[37:10.800 --> 37:14.960]  of a blog where you could just link to it, right? Like if there's this, somebody had a video about
[37:14.960 --> 37:19.040]  something and you could just link to the video and it, you don't have to write a whole 700 word
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.920]  article about it just to link to it. It was a perfect format, right? It's it, you know,
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.320]  it's great for a lot of things, but it's really great when you're trying to make sense out of a
[37:28.320 --> 37:38.160]  sprawling saga. Yep. Yeah, exactly. You know, and, and you know, in the weeks and months after 9 11,
[37:38.160 --> 37:44.560]  you know, there, there were the the so-called war blogs that, that sprang up, right? You know,
[37:44.560 --> 37:49.120]  this is sort of like the, the, I mean, it's really, it was really the Genesis of like,
[37:49.120 --> 37:53.520]  you know, blogging about politics, you know, 9 11 sort of like, you know,
[37:53.520 --> 37:59.040]  kicked it off a little bit. And, you know, people were really like, holy shit, like this,
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.360]  you know, blogging is perfect for talking about this stuff, you know, cause like you said, like,
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.760]  you can synthesize a lot of different types of information from, you know, all over the place,
[38:07.760 --> 38:12.800]  like, Oh, CNN saying this, but the New York times is writing about this. And then, you know,
[38:12.800 --> 38:19.760]  insta pundits said this and, you know, Dave Weiner said this and it, you know, it's like hypertext
[38:19.760 --> 38:26.960]  it like hypertext. And in particular, like the bloggy sort of, you know, extension of that is,
[38:26.960 --> 38:31.360]  is really great for, for doing that sort of thing. And it still is, you know,
[38:32.800 --> 38:37.520]  in a way that, yeah, you know, in a way that something like Facebook maybe isn't,
[38:37.520 --> 38:44.480]  but Twitter is maybe even better. I don't know. Yeah. Twitter's better in some ways and,
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.200]  but worse than others, because the one thing that you could do that was easier or it still
[38:49.200 --> 38:56.240]  is easier with the blog is if I've got other, you know, I have a real life to run and a job
[38:56.240 --> 39:02.480]  and a family and et cetera. And I just want to catch up on what did Kottke say today? I can just
[39:02.480 --> 39:08.400]  go to the browser, hit, you know, command and, and just type K and it's already auto-complete,
[39:08.400 --> 39:16.080]  you know, I'm like two strokes away command and K return. And there I am. And there's your thoughts
[39:16.080 --> 39:20.080]  on the day. Whereas Twitter, it's all over the place. It's because it's interspersed with
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.200]  everybody else. Right? We can talk about Twitter later. Anyway, let me take a break here and thank
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.560]  our first sponsor. It's a brand new sponsor. And I'm very excited about this because I think it is
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.920]  a perfect use of podcasts, sponsorships. It's a new podcast themselves. It's called tech meme
[39:35.920 --> 39:41.120]  ride home. Now you can just go whatever your podcast app is. Just go there. The easiest way
[39:41.120 --> 39:48.640]  to find out more is just use your podcast app and search for tech meme ride home T T E C H M E M E.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.960]  So tech meme.com is a fantastic site. I've talked about it many times over the years. It's one of my
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.440]  very, very favorite. It's one of the websites I check every day just to see what the heck is new
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.880]  in the sort of things that I tend to read and link to and care about. But it's effectively
[40:06.880 --> 40:13.360]  a sort of ranked by order of importance daily tech news site of things around the web.
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.640]  And it's not entirely algorithmic. I think they do have some algorithms behind it,
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.400]  but they use human editors to sort of put things in order and decide where to link to.
[40:26.400 --> 40:32.400]  And when there's a story with a bunch of other people linking to the same thing, they aggregate
[40:32.400 --> 40:37.280]  all of those links into topics to really a great site if you've never checked it out. But anyway,
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.680]  what they've done with this podcast is they're taking what tech meme is good at and distilling
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.960]  it into podcast form. And they call it the ride home because they're doing it every weekday,
[40:46.960 --> 40:53.440]  Monday to Friday, posting around 5 PM Eastern each afternoon. And each episode is only 15 to
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.520]  20 minutes long. It's a great format. It is hosted by Brian McCullough, who also hosts a great
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.840]  podcast called the Internet History Podcast. Internet History Podcast has been around for
[41:05.840 --> 41:11.760]  about four years now. And they've had great episodes. I'll put them in this show notes.
[41:11.760 --> 41:15.760]  But they have one with Don Melton, who was, you guys should probably know is one of the
[41:15.760 --> 41:24.160]  originators at Apple of the Safari project. Oh, Malik had a great episode. But anyway,
[41:24.160 --> 41:30.720]  Brian is a terrific podcast host, and he does a fantastic job. Think of tech meme ride home as
[41:30.720 --> 41:39.520]  sort of like NPR for technical nerds for tech nerd news. It's really, really good. So my thanks to
[41:39.520 --> 41:45.680]  them for sponsoring the show. And rather than give you a URL, although the Internet History Podcast
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.760]  is at Internet history podcast.com. But for tech meme ride home, really, instead of a URL, the best
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.760]  thing to do is just search for tech meme ride home in your podcast app and subscribe, give it a
[41:57.760 --> 42:03.120]  listen. I really like it. It's really good. And again, only 1520 minutes long. So it's not like
[42:03.120 --> 42:08.480]  you're signing up for two hours or something like that. Really, really a great show. I really like
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.280]  it. All right, what were we talking about the early days? 911? The early days?
[42:17.680 --> 42:23.120]  While we're talking about downers, like 911? I think, you know, why don't we get it out of the
[42:23.120 --> 42:31.280]  way and talk about Dean Allen and text ism, in terms of. So Dean, a little bit like you,
[42:32.480 --> 42:35.840]  for those of you who don't know, Dean Allen wrote a website called text ism.
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.120]  I don't forget when it's he sort of hung up, but started before during fireball, I believe it was
[42:43.120 --> 42:50.400]  around 2001 when text ism started. And I think he stopped around 2006 or seven, and then he came
[42:50.400 --> 42:56.960]  back briefly, but then sort of disappeared mostly from the web. And then sadly,
[42:59.280 --> 43:09.200]  took his own life a few months ago. Man was text ism great. That's the thing that came out of
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.160]  Dean's passing. And those of us who knew him, either personally, or even if you just knew him
[43:14.160 --> 43:21.840]  through the website was how many people how many discussions I had. Just with an end, they just
[43:21.840 --> 43:28.560]  all revolved around Holy shit was text ism the shit or not. Yeah. Do you remember what
[43:30.320 --> 43:34.400]  I don't remember when I first saw it, but I remember how I felt every time
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.600]  I, you know, like saw a new post. And it was like this sort of like,
[43:39.600 --> 43:50.480]  and it was like, damn it. Like, I can't write that well. Like, I can't do it. I can try,
[43:51.440 --> 43:57.120]  like, but I'm not going to be able to do it. You know, he, like, I think, I think, you know,
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.240]  Paul Ford, like, whenever Paul Ford writes something, I'm just like, Jesus Christ. Yeah.
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.680]  Where does, how does he? Nah, damn it. I'm never going to be able to do that. You know,
[44:07.680 --> 44:13.600]  and Dean was like, you know, like every post it was like, ah, and it, and it didn't have to be
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.800]  long. And it was always so simple and straightforward and just sort of, you know,
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.160]  like talking about like nothing basically. Yeah. And it was just, you know, they were just like
[44:24.160 --> 44:31.280]  these perfect little chunks of, of wonderfulness. What was your one that you, I remember talking
[44:31.280 --> 44:36.160]  with you about it. Your favorite one was, was it like how to cook a chicken or yeah, it was
[44:36.160 --> 44:42.640]  like how to cook, how to cook soup. Oh yeah. How to make soup. Yeah. And, you know, he starts off
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.720]  with like, you need, you know, hydrogen and oxygen to make the water, you know, it sort of starts
[44:48.720 --> 44:56.080]  from there. And, and that actually, I don't think that was on Textism. I think he ran another site
[44:56.080 --> 45:02.240]  called Cardigan, Cardigan Industries. Right. And I was never clear on what the difference was
[45:02.240 --> 45:10.960]  between that and Textism. But, but the soup thing was on, was on, on there. Yeah. I've got a link to
[45:10.960 --> 45:18.240]  the, to the archive.org thing. I'll put it in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was Cardigan Industries.
[45:18.880 --> 45:23.440]  I'm not sure what the difference was either. And I even got to know Dean personally for a while,
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.640]  but he was, you could ask him questions like that and he would, he would evade them in a,
[45:30.640 --> 45:36.000]  and it was like, he was like Tom Bombadil, you know, it was just like you, you ask him a
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.600]  question and he starts singing a song about something, you know, it's like he wouldn't sing,
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.440]  but you know, it's the same sort of thing. It was like, you know, just, I'm not going to talk about
[45:43.440 --> 45:50.480]  that. Yeah. But he had, it was, it was an, it was sort of like meeting a street magician too,
[45:50.480 --> 45:54.960]  where you don't even realize what's happened until it's happened. It wasn't like you'd ask him like,
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.800]  what the hell is the difference between Cardigan and Textism? And he wouldn't just give you like
[45:58.800 --> 46:06.720]  no answer and be rude about it. He would make you feel as though he, you know, it wasn't the least
[46:06.720 --> 46:13.920]  bit rude at all, but you'd realize at the end of it that he hadn't said he hadn't explained it in
[46:13.920 --> 46:23.200]  the least bit. Yeah. There's a funny gag. I'm looking at the Cardigan Industries and I still
[46:23.200 --> 46:33.680]  enjoy it, but the way he formatted the dates is he has in text January 10. And then the year,
[46:33.680 --> 46:39.680]  the first two digits of the year are rendered as an image, the two O and then just the O one is text.
[46:39.680 --> 46:50.560]  And that's such a Dean Allen gag that, yeah, it's like a throwback to like I don't know, like,
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.360]  uh, uh, like mechanical devices that would tell you what the day is or something like that.
[46:55.360 --> 47:00.560]  But they would, uh, like growing up, they would have like the 19 was pre-rendered or something
[47:00.560 --> 47:05.520]  like that. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And then that, you know, that was the other thing is that
[47:05.520 --> 47:11.680]  like, like his sites were beautifully designed, you know, and it was sort of like, again, that,
[47:11.680 --> 47:17.680]  you know, that feeling for me of like, damn it, that's so good. Like I can't,
[47:17.680 --> 47:26.640]  like, I can't quite get there, you know, uh, fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat
[47:26.640 --> 47:32.880]  until you have enough. Exactly. What a beautiful sentence. While the water is heating, raise some
[47:32.880 --> 47:39.040]  cattle, pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering preferably while you are away.
[47:39.040 --> 47:50.880]  You are away. It's so good. Oh, it really is. Um, he, I, you know, it's easy to get,
[47:50.880 --> 47:57.520]  uh, modeling about somebody after he's passed. Um, but I, and I would have said it while he was
[47:57.520 --> 48:04.400]  alive. He was the best at, at the, he was just the best at it, of having a site that's like,
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.680]  you know, your site and you post these little things either on a daily basis or, you know,
[48:09.680 --> 48:17.680]  somewhat regularly. Um, and he was just the best at it. He really was. I totally agree. I totally
[48:17.680 --> 48:24.800]  agree. Uh, huge inspiration for me and, you know, and you too. Absolutely. You know, cocky was
[48:24.800 --> 48:31.760]  absolutely huge, inspiring me and sort of figuring out a format that I could do it. Um,
[48:31.760 --> 48:38.160]  uh, but it's an inner, like you and Dean, like as dual influences, it was like,
[48:39.120 --> 48:42.720]  and I think, I don't think you'll take this the wrong way. It's not cause I certainly don't
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.360]  mean it as an insult in the least, but it was like, I totally got what you were doing.
[48:48.400 --> 48:53.760]  And with Dean, I, I didn't even get it. I just knew that I loved it. Like, I don't even know
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.640]  what you did there. It's like, I loved, I'd read a post from him and I'd, I would think,
[48:58.640 --> 49:05.600]  I'm not even sure what he did there, but I loved it. Yeah. I would like to try to do something
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.120]  like that. Yeah. There was, yeah, there was clearly something else going on behind the
[49:11.120 --> 49:17.120]  curtain that you didn't know about. Whereas, you know, like I can't help being just straightforward.
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.920]  So like it, you know, it's pretty much what you see is what you get. Um, but it's always nice
[49:23.920 --> 49:31.600]  discovering those sites, you know, like Dean's site, um, where you don't quite understand where
[49:31.600 --> 49:38.080]  they're coming from, but God, it's wonderful to read, you know? Right. Yeah. It always felt like
[49:38.080 --> 49:45.440]  there was a backstory and in joke in very, you know, like, like a whole bunch of people who know
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.480]  exactly it was written as though everybody knew what was going on. And then I remember at one
[49:50.480 --> 49:54.080]  point like saying, well, the hell with this, I'm going back to the beginning and reading this whole
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.520]  thing, you know, going to his archive, I'm going to read the whole thing and then it'll all make
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.720]  sense to me. And it didn't, it was, it just started like the first post. The first few posts started
[50:02.720 --> 50:10.880]  from the idea that everybody knew what was going on here, but, uh, it, it, it, it wasn't, I don't
[50:10.880 --> 50:19.440]  know. It's, and, and I, we can parlay from, from our remembrances of Dean to just sort of talking
[50:19.440 --> 50:29.440]  about that era as a whole. And I don't want to, uh, I don't want to make it seem as though you
[50:29.440 --> 50:35.200]  and I are like the last two gunslinger standing from an era because there's all sorts of people
[50:35.200 --> 50:40.560]  who wrote back then who are still around and there's people like Dave Weiner who were doing it,
[50:40.560 --> 50:50.400]  you know, effectively started, you know, blogging like at hotwired in like 94, 95, you know, who's,
[50:50.400 --> 50:58.240]  who's I, as far as I know, has, has published on a regular basis, daily basis, probably other than
[50:58.240 --> 51:03.120]  when he was like, you know, dealing with like, you know, family issues or something like that,
[51:03.120 --> 51:12.880]  you know, I mean, it's guys never stopped, but there was like a, a community and, and, you know,
[51:12.880 --> 51:17.520]  and it sort of ties together with like the early years of South by Southwest where at least that's
[51:17.520 --> 51:23.840]  where we'd all get together. Um, and there's so many people who were writing back then who just
[51:23.840 --> 51:30.160]  over the years stopped or moved on to other things at the very least. And there aren't many sites
[51:30.160 --> 51:36.160]  from that group of people who, what did we used to call it? Even when I can, the sidebar of your
[51:36.160 --> 51:41.600]  site, you'd have like a list of other recommended sites. We had like a name for a blog roll blog
[51:41.600 --> 51:49.360]  roll. That's it. There just aren't many sites from that era that are still around. Yeah. And
[51:49.360 --> 51:55.760]  there's something sad about that. And I don't know if you know, what is it about, about doing this
[51:55.760 --> 52:07.200]  that, that you think has kept you going on a regular basis? Well, um, God, I don't even know.
[52:07.200 --> 52:16.640]  I mean, I think that, you know, I mean, it, it became my job several years ago, so that's,
[52:16.640 --> 52:22.080]  so that's one thing. Well, when did that happen? When did you go full time? So 2005. So like
[52:22.080 --> 52:30.800]  February, 2005. And, you know, I did it. I basically had a, you know, like a PBS NPR
[52:30.800 --> 52:36.160]  style pledge drive where I said, Hey, I'm, I just quit my job. Like I want to do Katka.org full
[52:36.160 --> 52:43.200]  time. Like, will you support me? You know, please sign up for, you know, you know, please give me,
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.480]  you know, 20 bucks or something. And I had all sorts of prizes. Like I had books signed by
[52:48.480 --> 52:56.320]  Malcolm Gladwell and, and you know, memberships in various things and free software and all that
[52:56.320 --> 53:05.360]  sort of stuff. And you know, I was able to able to get enough to, to do it to, you know, sort of
[53:05.360 --> 53:10.160]  bootstrap it for the first year. And what were you doing? What were you doing before that to support
[53:10.160 --> 53:17.360]  yourself? I was a web designer, just like freelance, right? No. So I worked, I worked at a, at a
[53:17.360 --> 53:26.080]  financial services organization in New York called the Bond Market Association. And yeah, so it was,
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.960]  it was basically all these companies, all these big companies that traded bonds in, you know,
[53:30.960 --> 53:37.760]  2004, 2005, they were, you know, all the companies that blew up the country or almost blew up the
[53:37.760 --> 53:44.240]  country, like two, three years later. You know, and we were at work, like at work and, and we're
[53:44.240 --> 53:51.360]  like, hey, there are these new things called CDOs. Maybe we should make a, you know, a site that
[53:51.360 --> 53:57.600]  explains what they are and, you know, collects information about their pricing and all of that
[53:57.600 --> 54:04.160]  sort of stuff. And we, we presented that idea to these, to these, you know, bond companies. And
[54:04.160 --> 54:10.960]  they were like, nope, we don't, we don't want any transparency about this. I had no idea. I had no
[54:10.960 --> 54:19.360]  idea that we don't want people to know what's going on. No, they did. They didn't, you know,
[54:19.360 --> 54:26.960]  with, with good reason, there was nothing good going on. We do not want people looking behind
[54:26.960 --> 54:33.200]  this curtain. No, no. We're sort of, you know, and they're, they're like, you know, they're basically,
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.080]  you know, all these companies are like basically paying the, paying the dues, you know, paying
[54:38.080 --> 54:42.400]  their dues, paying for, you know, for this, this bond market association who exists. So we were
[54:42.400 --> 54:51.200]  like, yeah, okay, I guess we're not going to do that. There was, you know, so going pro and being
[54:51.200 --> 54:57.600]  able to do it full time I think you're saying is one of the reasons you've been able to keep doing
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.560]  it. And I think that that's probably true for me as well. I think if I hadn't been able to do it
[55:02.560 --> 55:08.560]  full time, I don't know that I would've stopped writing during fireball, but I think it might've
[55:08.560 --> 55:17.760]  gotten very sporadic because I, I doing it as a side thing was exhausting. I was exhilarated by
[55:17.760 --> 55:23.200]  it. But the thing that the only thing that kept me going like in the first four years before I went
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.960]  full time in 2006 was the notion that there I'd figure out some way to do it full time.
[55:28.960 --> 55:33.920]  And if, you know, if that had never happened, like eventually that would've,
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.720]  you know, give it enough years. It's like, well, this, it's not going to happen. I think without
[55:40.720 --> 55:47.520]  that carrot in front of me, it would've been too hard to keep going. And I don't blame people. I,
[55:47.520 --> 55:51.600]  that's the other thing is I get it that there were lots of people with very popular
[55:51.600 --> 55:57.840]  web blogs back then who had no desire to do it full time. But I also see how it wasn't sustainable
[55:57.840 --> 56:04.800]  to write as regularly as they, as they were without that. Well, I mean, once people start
[56:04.800 --> 56:10.960]  stopping, then, you know, your, your impetus to keep going to keep, you know, sort of writing
[56:10.960 --> 56:16.400]  within this group of, of similar minded people, you know, that a little bit of that goes away
[56:16.400 --> 56:23.280]  every time someone stops you know, and people were getting married, having kids, starting companies
[56:23.280 --> 56:27.920]  and just plain had other responsibilities, you know, like, I don't, I don't think after my,
[56:27.920 --> 56:32.720]  you know, after my son was born, if I wasn't doing the site full time, I think it would've
[56:32.720 --> 56:39.440]  just stopped completely because that, you know, I would've had a job and, you know, a new son
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.680]  and it, it just would, that would have been the thing that had to go, you know,
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.880]  that's interesting. See, for me, it was the opposite. Jonas was born in 2004.
[56:48.880 --> 56:58.880]  So that was two years before I went full time. And I found it to be one of the most remarkably
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.120]  productive periods of my life. Now, part of it was that I, what I was doing to support myself was
[57:03.120 --> 57:08.880]  like mostly freelance web design and other consulting type stuff. So I was doing it from
[57:08.880 --> 57:16.560]  home. So I didn't have to go somewhere at nine in the morning. But like, I literally like, I think
[57:16.560 --> 57:23.200]  like the original version of markdown came out right after Jonas was born and all of the stuff,
[57:23.200 --> 57:27.040]  you know, like that whole first year, in addition to writing during fireball was when markdown went
[57:27.040 --> 57:36.320]  from like a public beta to a 1.0 all while I had like an infant son, but I just have this vivid,
[57:36.320 --> 57:41.440]  I remember where my desk was in our old house when he was born. And I would just be the one
[57:41.440 --> 57:46.640]  who if he was up late at night, that I would, you know, get him and take him out of, you know,
[57:47.760 --> 57:53.920]  out of the bedroom. And I remember doing so much work on markdown with Jonas literally on my lap,
[57:53.920 --> 57:59.760]  like I'd put my one leg on top of my knee and just sort of use it as a my lap as a cradle and
[57:59.760 --> 58:06.320]  I'd be sitting there typing pro code. And I just I also remember writing a lot of daring fireball
[58:06.320 --> 58:13.680]  articles at like three or four in the morning with him on my lap. Yeah. So I totally get it
[58:13.680 --> 58:17.360]  that if you have a day job, it is incompatible if you have to actually, you know, and then I would
[58:17.360 --> 58:26.960]  just sleep till noon or whatever. Right. But I get it. I do get how it, you know, the group of
[58:26.960 --> 58:31.600]  people I'm talking about, we were largely about the same age. And certainly the older we get,
[58:31.600 --> 58:36.560]  it's effectively the same age, you know, like back then, you know, it felt like, you know,
[58:36.560 --> 58:41.920]  if I was 29, and somebody else was 33, it'd be like, Oh, you're, you're, you're a couple
[58:41.920 --> 58:49.280]  years older than me. Now. It's like, we're exactly the same age. Yeah. Yeah. And I think
[58:49.280 --> 58:53.440]  starting companies too, like so many of the people we know from back then started their
[58:53.440 --> 58:57.280]  own companies. And it was, you know, with actual products and stuff like that. And it's
[58:57.280 --> 59:04.480]  so, yeah, super, super time consuming. So I can, I get it. Yeah. I mean, you know,
[59:04.480 --> 59:10.080]  Stuart Butterfield, who, you know, is now the CEO of Slack. And, you know, co founded Flickr
[59:10.080 --> 59:15.200]  and all that stuff. Like he, his blog was one of my favorites. Yeah, I actually had
[59:15.200 --> 59:20.080]  Stuart in the back of my head for this. And it's like, well, I kind of get why he, he stopped
[59:20.080 --> 59:31.360]  blogging. Of course. Yeah, of course. It's kind of fascinating watching this as a side
[59:31.360 --> 59:42.080]  note watching like, I kind of love good 2.0. And it's kind of fascinating watching Slack
[59:42.080 --> 59:49.320]  and seeing it as Flickr 2.0. And like, you know, because I think in hindsight, he clearly
[59:49.320 --> 59:56.040]  I think he and Katarina sold Flickr to Yahoo way too soon for way too little. And then
[59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.040]  they regretted eventually, you know, quickly regretted all the loss of control that they
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.880]  had. And now with Slack, it's sort of the opposite. And he's sort of built it up as
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.720]  this thing that he's, he's not going to have, you know, if he ever, if Slack ever does sell
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:19.000]  or whatever, it'll be on his terms. It's very, it's so interesting to me to watch it. Yeah.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.200]  And yet there's still certain aspects of it that are still so stewardy, you know, in a
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.880]  way that Flickr, the original version of Flickr was very, you know, you could, you could see
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:36.600]  the DNA. Exactly. Yeah. You know, and I feel like, you know, Ev is trying to do a similar
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.840]  thing with medium. Like, you know, he, like he keeps bashing away at the same problem,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.960]  right. You know, like mediums like a 3.0, right. And then Twitter and then medium, right.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:57.040]  For him. And maybe Odeo was like a 0.5 in there somewhere. Which is, you know, Odeo's
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.800]  super interesting because it's like, you know, talk about being too early. Right. You know,
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.200]  it was like riding like the second wave of podcasting and now we're in like the eighth
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.720]  wave of podcasting or something. And it's like really going now. Yeah. No, it's really
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.520]  become a thing. And, you know, everybody, you know, mainstream, you know you know, like
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.040]  CBS news has podcasts, you know, it's like you couldn't get more mainstream and Odeo,
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.360]  you know, they clearly, you know, Ev, you know, he's so, he's always been so good at
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.960]  seeing where internet based publishing in general is going and what would be the next
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.520]  big thing. And he was so clearly right that podcasting had a big, bright future ahead
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:43.120]  of it. It was just the wrong time. Yeah. Yeah. Ev is like one of the best, I think, product
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.480]  people like ever. Yeah, totally. I totally agree. Because he's, you know, he has that
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:57.000]  Steve Jobsian thing of being able to see where it's going way long in advance, you know,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.720]  that this is, you know, we're not going to, you know, it's that literally like one of
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.360]  Jobs's famous quotes was something to the effect of, you know, we don't build what people
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.320]  ask us to build, we, we figure out what they want, and then build it for them. Right. Right.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.760]  Yeah. And, you know, going back to the, you know, early days of blogging and blogger and
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.080]  stuff like that, I remember, you know, they, you know, blogger at the time was still this
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:32.760]  thing that, you know, FTP files to people's, you know, to people's, you know, shell account.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.720]  And, you know, they were talking about it, you know, when they were doing when they were
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.700]  thinking about doing blogspot, like a hosted, you know, blogger thing, you know, they were
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:51.280]  talking about like, this is gonna, you know, Chinese people blogging is gonna like revolutionize,
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.560]  you know, politics in the world. And like, they were, they knew, you know, like Matt
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:07.160]  and Ev, Matt Howey and Ev and Meg and Paul Bausch. Like, you know, they, they, it's like
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.400]  the discussions they were having are still like these same discussions that were like,
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.900]  like it, you know, it happened, right? You know, all of that stuff came to pass. I always
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.880]  felt guilty because I could see that they were doing that. And I could tell that they
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.480]  were right. And I found it terribly exciting. And I really didn't have a desire to contribute
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:34.760]  to building that sort of thing. I just wanted to use it myself. Like, like, I think it's,
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.800]  you know, I honestly feel it's, you know, not to get corny about it, but I honestly
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.240]  feel that with Daring Fireball, I, I feel like I've always felt that I was born at the
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.880]  right time. Like, I've always felt very, very comfortable with like, being a child of the
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:56.960]  80s. And, you know, going through the 90s as a young adult. But I just in my bones,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.920]  I feel like Daring Fireball is what I was meant to do. You know, like, rather than,
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.520]  I guess I contributed in some ways by inventing Markdown, you know, to helping other people
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.480]  publish. But for the most part, I just wanted to use it. Like, what keeps me going is that
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.880]  I never, there's never been like a week, I've been doing this for 15 and a half years, something
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:24.280]  like that. I never finish a week and think that I wrote about everything I wish I had
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.720]  written about for the last week. Like, there's never, you know, like, I've, I've never felt
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.720]  like I'm, the ideas are dry. Let's take the opposite. I have the opposite problem. What
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.520]  I think about when it comes to like, Hmm, should I write a book? Ideas, right? None.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.900]  Right. Just a box. It's like a very dusty box that is completely empty. Whereas ideas
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.200]  for things to write about or linked to on Daring Fireball. It's I never catch up. It's
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.600]  like, I've, it's, um, it's like the, the Lucy at the chocolate factory.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:05.760]  Exactly. Yeah. That, I mean, and I feel like it's been getting worse for me. Like now it
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.080]  kind of bothers me. Like at the end of the week, I'm like, God damn it. I did not get
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.840]  enough done. Like I need to hire some more people or I don't know, something. Have you
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.560]  ever wanted to hire anybody to like grow the site?
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.400]  Let's hold that thought. Let's hold that thought. And I'm going to thank another one of our
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.080]  friends and we will pick it up right there because that is actually one of the things
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.080]  I wanted to talk about. Um, our next sponsor is another new sponsor. Very, very excited
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:39.800]  about this one to flow. What is flow? Flow is a beautiful project management system for
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:45.500]  teams everywhere is the easiest way to run your team, to manage projects, to track tasks
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:50.440]  and stay up to date with everything happening at work. Um, if you're having trouble managing
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:56.760]  a busy team battling floods of email and notifications and just struggling to keep up with who's
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.980]  working on what, who's assigned to what then flow is for you. And one of the best things
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:08.680]  about flow and I think it's perfect fit for my audience is that it is designed by real
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:15.360]  designers and it looks beautiful and there's so much clarity in the interface in terms
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.840]  of what am I looking at? What is this? It is so clear when you look at it in terms of
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:27.000]  how it works. It's so clearly not like a task management project management system built
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.600]  by, you know, like non-designing engineers. Really, really great. Would you just go to
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.600]  the website and check it out and you'll see it instantly that it's really, really good
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.280]  for designers. Um, their world class design team has worked with companies like Apple,
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.680]  black, Ted and Starbucks. So that's some of the people who've worked with them. Uh, it's
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.800]  really simple and beautiful to use. And this year that flows been around for a while, but
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.280]  they've, they've done like effectively a 2.0 and rebuilt flow from the ground up to focus

[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.280]  thanks to them. So have I ever thought about hiring somebody? That's a, to me, it's one
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.440]  of the big differences between cocky and during fireball is everything. I've, there's never
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:18.440]  been anything on during fireball, not by me. And have I thought about it? Yeah. Uh, but
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:25.880]  it's this point, it feels like Cal Ripken's streak. Like I, you know, like, and part of
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:33.280]  it too is that I feel like you're, you're more like Johnny Carson, like the, you don't,
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.720]  there's your natural and Johnny had, you know, guest hosts, you know, who went on to bigger
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.280]  and better things, including Letterman and Leno and um, um, you know, all sorts of Gary
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.600]  Shandling, all sorts of people who went on to great things, guest hosted the tonight
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.400]  show so that Johnny could take it easy and work as Letterman one said, backbreaking three
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:01.680]  days, three nights a week for 40 weeks a year. Uh, uh, I also feel, I feel like I'm more
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.480]  like Letterman though. Like I'm neurotic and uh, like I'm not comfortable with that. Like
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.480]  Johnny had no reason to be worried about it cause he was Johnny Carson. It didn't matter
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.340]  if David Letterman guest hosted, you know, on Monday, it didn't matter how good he did.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.400]  You know, Johnny's still Johnny. And I feel like, you know, you've had guests hosts. I
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.120]  forget. I mean, I've lost track of how many guests hosts there have been at Kottke over
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:31.680]  the years. Yeah. I mean more, more than a dozen, I would say at least. I mean, it started,
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:41.840]  I mean the first time was when I went to South by Southwest in, was it 2000, maybe 2001.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.520]  And I don't know why I felt the need to keep the site updated while I was there or to have
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.600]  the site be updated while I was there. But I asked my friend Greg Nous to, uh, to fill
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:00.520]  in and I don't know, it just seemed like a, I don't know. I can't even remember why I
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:07.280]  did it. Like I'm, I guess I'm not just seemed like I needed to, I don't know. Didn't Aaron
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:17.280]  Swartz guest host once or no, no, no, no, no, no. I remember Greg doing it. Um, Greg
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:26.600]  remains one of the world's best experts on movable type. Uh, I don't know. I don't know
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.000]  how relevant that skill is, but it's still, if whenever I need serious help with movable
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.160]  type, I still go to Greg. Uh, yeah. He's also a wonderful writer. Like I love his writing.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.600]  He's, he's really good. Um, I wish, I wish he would do more of it. Yeah. If he's listening,
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:51.320]  Greg write more. Uh, yeah, for me, I don't know. It's irrational. Uh, and at this point
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.880]  it is, you know, I'm not gonna say it's trouble, but it means that like, even when I go on
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:03.600]  vacation, I'm still posting at least something to during fireball almost every day and I
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:10.400]  don't mind it. Um, but I wonder at this point, like Andy Bayos talking about people from
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.120]  that era, you know, Andy asked me a few years ago, what was the long, what's the longest
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.760]  period of time between posts to during fireball since it started. And then the early days
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.900]  it might be, it's easily a couple of days because like from 2002 to 2004 I didn't have
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.480]  the short articles, you know, the ones that I call linked list entries. I only had like
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:37.320]  full big headline articles and I, you know, but I don't think, I don't think I ever went
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:45.440]  a week without an article in that era. Um, and then from 2004 onward, I, I really, my
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.280]  guess would be I've never gone more than 72 hours without posting something. And if, if
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:59.400]  I'm wrong, it wouldn't be much longer than that. Um, yeah, I, I love, you know, like
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.240]  I love doing the site and like it, it, it, I mean, it's obviously like the thing that
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:12.840]  I do that gives me the most, uh, that makes me the happiest sort of overall, like intellectually,
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:19.320]  emotionally, whatever. Uh, but I really love getting away from it and like, not, you know,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:27.400]  like I, I was on vacation a couple of weeks ago and, um, uh, a friend of mine, Chris Anthony
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.400]  took, took over the site for the week and I didn't read it until I got back. I just
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.120]  didn't, I just didn't read it. Um, I stayed off Twitter. I still use Instagram because
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:46.600]  I feel like Instagram is more of a personal sort of thing. It's not work. Um, but I just,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.760]  I love, I don't know, I love getting away from it and then I come back and I feel like
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.640]  I'm like, okay, let's, let's do this thing again. You know, it's really, I don't know.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640]  It's really nice to recharge.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:03.040]  Yeah, I don't know. I, I don't know. I don't know what that feels like. I don't know what
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:12.040]  that would feel like. I really, maybe you should give them a try sometime. I don't know.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.960]  Does Amy, like, does Amy give you shit about that? Like, or does she just sort of like,
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.960]  this is the deal. This is who I married now. I would say a little bit of column a, a little
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:31.360]  bit of column b. And I feel like I've gotten good at it. Twitter has made it much easier,
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:38.080]  uh, in my opinion, because I can, we can go on vacation and just by checking Twitter every
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.360]  once in a while, uh, I can queue up things that are good to link to instead of doing
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.920]  it right there and pecking it out. I have a way, I have a way, you know, I have the
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:54.640]  movable type, uh, iPhone plugin thing, which is a fairly reasonable interface to posting
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.760]  on the phone. But usually what I do is I use, um, uh, and I wanted to ask you some questions
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.440]  about how you do what you do, but I, for the most part of, if I'm on vacation or just traveling
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.680]  in general, I'll find things that I think are worth linking to and I'll send those links
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:20.880]  to pinboard, uh, you know, the successor to delicious. And, um, for the most part, everything
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.240]  in my pinboard is just sort of a waiting queue for things I might post to during fireball.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.760]  Even when I'm not on vacation, I use pinboard for this exact purpose. Like in the morning
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.560]  when I wake up, if I read the, you know, I'm not really ready to post stuff to during fireball
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:39.200]  or if I'm just on the phone in general, I just send it to, to pinboard and I find it
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.400]  useful because when I come back to pinboard and I have time, like let's say I'm on vacation,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.320]  but I've, you know, here, I'll take 30 minutes here and sometimes you can, like the best
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.960]  way to tell if I'm on vacation is if I've got, you know, if you look like an RSS where
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.400]  the times are actually there and I have four posts on a Wednesday, but they're all within
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.360]  30 minutes, you know, like three to three 30 in the afternoon, but it's because I've
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.120]  queued them up and I may not have them written, but I know what I want to say, but I'll look
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.840]  at like maybe the 10 most recent things that I've queued up and like six of them, I'm now
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:18.840]  like, eh, and I'm, nah, that's not worth it. And it's, it's, it's good to have that cooling
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:24.040]  off period for me at least in terms of what's actually worth linking to.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:30.800]  Um, yeah, I mean that, I mean that's, that's exactly how I approach it. I don't use pinboard.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.940]  I use Instapaper, but that's exactly how I do it. And you know, the thing about the cooling
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:39.380]  off period is, is totally a thing. Like I'll, you know, I'll find something and then I'll
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:45.040]  go back to it, you know, a few hours later and I'm like, yeah, no, not feeling it anymore.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.880]  So Amy might have a different answer as to how annoying it is when, when we're ostensibly
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:56.000]  on vacation and how much of my day I still spend doing that sort of thing. But I don't
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.400]  think it takes that much time. And for me, the things that take so much time are when
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.360]  I write real articles and I, you know, I, that's something I don't do when I'm on vacation
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.560]  and do take breaks from, um, and do come back sometimes feeling refreshed. Like it's interesting
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.560]  when you look at the daring fireball archives. Um, if you just go to during fireball.net
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:24.120]  slash archive, um, it only lists my quote unquote full articles. Um, but they're organized
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:30.160]  by month going all the way back to 2002 and you can see, and it's not purposeful. I don't
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.480]  do it on purpose, but you can see that there are stretches where it's very, very dry, you
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.080]  know, like two or three month period, three, four month period where I've only had like
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:45.240]  two or three per month. Um, and then other times where there's seven, eight, nine a month
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:51.400]  for months at a time. Uh, so there's something to that. But to me, the actual just linking
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:58.400]  to a few things a day part, uh, it, it's, it, it's so easy to me and I'm so even when
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.720]  I'm on vacation, I'm still like a news junkie. Like I can't turn that off.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.680]  Hmm. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not a news junkie, which is a little bit of a weird thing to
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.640]  say about myself, I guess. Well, that's one of the most interesting things about cocky
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.060]  over cocky.org over the years is that it's not really, it's never really been, maybe
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:27.280]  the nine 11 stretch was an obvious exception. Um, but for the most part it's absolutely
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:37.920]  never been about news ever. I mean the closest thing to news that I regularly count on is
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.920]  when I, you know, it's off cocky.org is often the first place where I see the trailer to
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.260]  a movie that, Oh yeah, I want to see that. Right. Right. So if you call, you know, new
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:55.440]  movie trailers, news, you know, maybe that's the closest you get to it. Right. Yeah. I,
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:03.360]  you know, it's, I feel like, I don't know, I don't read, I don't read the news a whole
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.880]  lot. Like I don't keep up with the news, you know, quote unquote the news. Um, I think
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:19.800]  a lot of it is kind of unnecessary and just sort of, I don't know, there are very few
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:27.880]  things in my life that I need that much information about. Um, you know, like, like the, there
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.780]  are entire channels devoted to how the stock market does minute by minute. Like that seems
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:40.440]  insane to me. Like you normal people don't need that information, you know, but there
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.360]  are plenty of sort of normal people that, that, that do like watch that stuff sort of
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:53.680]  meticulously. Um, and I, I don't know, I just don't find, I, I'm just not that way about
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:19:02.720]  it. I don't know. No, I get it. I don't, I don't think it's healthy. I admit to doing
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.960]  it myself, but I don't think it's healthy. And I, I think that people who don't pay that
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:12.840]  much attention to the news are probably much happier than people who do. Right. I mean,
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.400]  I guess maybe it's just a matter of like what you pay meticulous attention to because, you
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:25.560]  know, I'm on Twitter all day. Um, and you know, obviously like I do see the news, I'm
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:34.240]  aware of news happening. Uh, but I'm not interested in sort of drilling down into, you know, a
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:41.080]  lot of, a lot of things. Um, you know, I guess I'm more interested in, in, I don't know,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:47.840]  like longer reign, you know, longer themes and ideas and, and, and things like that.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:55.040]  Um, you know, in, in the, you know, in the, in the sites, more expansive moments in the
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:03.680]  sites, you know, sort of like at its best. Um, but there are obviously like, you know,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:10.160]  silly videos and stuff too, because silly video people love silly videos. Do you think,
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:16.680]  I think that that's one of the ways that kaki.org is the most different now from the early days
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:23.080]  is that it's, it's lart, you know, on a regular, I almost daily basis, there's videos that
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:29.000]  are posted. Whereas like you even said, like back in, you know, 2000, 2001, 2002, even
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.480]  for a couple of years after that it was, it's so inordinately expensive to host video. Uh,
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:43.320]  that video was just, you just couldn't post it. It was too expensive, you know? Yeah.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.680]  And a way we would post it back then is you'd have to, you'd have to put it on your own
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:53.560]  server and cause there was nothing like youtube, not, not even nothing to even compare it to.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.920]  And then your everybody's hosting account had like a monthly bandwidth limit and you
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.440]  would just multiply how many page views you had by how big the video was. And you easily
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:09.160]  got to that limit within like 20 minutes and then, and then people would get like, uh,
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.360]  forget what the error message was, but you know, there's like an error code, like temporarily
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:19.460]  suspended. Right. Yeah. I mean, you, youtube and Vimeo, like they changed, changed that
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:27.680]  whole thing. Um, where, you know, just made embedding videos on sites easy. Yeah. Um,
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:33.640]  you know, and I think, you know, I, I mean, I was a designer and I, you know, the, the
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:39.520]  like oscillate was very visual and, you know, I think it was just sort of this thing where
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:45.960]  it was like, you know, I, the site, you know, katky.org was on like a friend's server and
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:52.880]  I wasn't really paying that much for it. And so I couldn't really embed images or, you
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.540]  know, certainly not videos and things like that. And so it was sort of out of necessity
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:01.880]  that was very text heavy and, you know, sort of as things evolved and, you know, moved
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.280]  to my own server and, and all that sort of stuff. And bandwidth is, you know, just gotten
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.680]  cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. Um, you know, now it's like, I want to, I
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.360]  want to be, you know, I want to, I want the site to be as visual as possible because like
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.440]  that's, you know, like I love text and I, you know, I think, you know, Tim Carmody has
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.480]  written on my site that, you know, if you, if you bet against text, you will lose, uh,
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:33.620]  you know, text will always be around and it will always, you know, be a contender for
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:38.120]  like the thing that people are always using, you know, but I think that, you know, a lot
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:45.480]  of what I, a lot of what I watch and consume is, is, you know, it's, it's visual, uh, you
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.480]  know, whether that's, it's good photography or, um, you know, movie trailers, like you
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.960]  said, or, you know, some weird thing on, on Vimeo.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.720]  Well, I, did you see, I'm sure you saw the, cause I know you're a spike Jones fan. The,
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.340]  um, he did the recent music video for Apple with the home pod. And then today ad age,
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:10.560]  I think has it exclusively the behind the scenes. Oh, I didn't, I didn't see that behind
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:15.240]  the scenes, but you're going to love it. Um, I thought this was obvious. I thought it was
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.880]  obvious both knowing spike Jones and having seen the video that almost everything they
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:25.040]  did was a practical effect, like all the stretching stuff going on while she danced in our apartment.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.720]  I could tell that that was all practical and it didn't look like CGI to me. Um, but a lot
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.520]  of people are obviously, so I think just so basically assume anything that's a special
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:40.140]  effect is computer generated. Now we're blown away, like at the behind the scenes of how
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.700]  they actually did this. And it's just like, they just had two guys behind the wall just
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:52.580]  pulling it backwards. Um, but it's to me effects still rule, but to me it's like a six or seven
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:58.000]  minute video. It's arguably more interesting than the video itself. And I, you know, but
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.040]  they're both lovely, but it's the sort of thing that pre YouTube you would have to like,
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.000]  I remember, I forget the name of it, but there were like a series of DVDs that came out in
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.640]  the late nineties of like great music videos. Um, and um, I've got it down here in my little
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.400]  podcast cave in the basement. It's in a box somewhere down here on DVD. Um, but it was
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.540]  so fantastic. I remember watching it over and over and over again cause you could then
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:30.920]  watch the great music videos, but then they had like behind the scenes stuff. But it was
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.280]  the sort of thing that like pre YouTube you'd hear that there was this great behind the
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.560]  scenes video of, you know, a spike Jones video, but you'd have to figure out a way to hunt
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.360]  it down on, you know, it was like trying to find bootleg tape tapes back in the eighties.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.960]  You had to know a guy and you'd hear, it was more of like a rumor or a legend than something
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.080]  that you would just click a button and now you can watch it at any point you want. Yeah.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:06.440]  I mean everything, I mean that's the thing though, like everything has DVD extras. Right.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:13.360]  I find, and it is weird, like now that cocky is so video heavy, I do find that it takes
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:19.680]  me longer to read your site that it used to because you can't, I can read so much faster
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:26.600]  than a video goes that, uh, but that's largely what I do is I, at the end of the day, I still
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:33.360]  to me, um, one of the sites where I just go to and read, like I don't even bother with
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.000]  RSS for your site. I just, you know, I just have this habit of just going there in a new
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.320]  window so that all the tabs are from this, uh, but I'm just braced now that I'm not just
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.680]  going to open up a bunch of tabs that I'm going to spend at least 15 minutes watching
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:56.920]  video. Right. And that's definitely a difference. Oh, definitely. Yeah, it definitely is. Um,
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:04.080]  and you like you, I think, you know, maybe have embedded two or three videos all time.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:12.080]  Maybe I don't like embeds. I really, uh, I've done my live talk shows, videos as embeds
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:20.840]  from Vimeo. Uh, right. I remember when I saw, like, I think the, like the first embed you
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:29.820]  had, like, like even an image, um, like I was shocked and I think it was probably like,
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:33.160]  it was probably like a photo of your son. Yeah. I think that might've been, it might've
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:39.320]  been the first image on during fireball and it was shocking. Right. Right. It was shocking.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:47.120]  It was like, Oh my God, I still get that. I have, I even have like a list here of, um,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.800]  posts on during fireball with photos slash images and it's, I don't know, somewhere around
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:59.880]  20. Yeah, it can't be. But I know that I don't think it's complete yet. Uh, I think that
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.680]  there might be some older ones that I've missed, but every time I encounter one, I do that
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:09.440]  because of what happens is, uh, I'll post something and I'll put a photo in it and,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.960]  and I'll get like on Twitter, like, Holy shit, is this the first time there's ever been an
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.600]  image on during fireball? And I'm like, you know, no, it's happened like 20 times over
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:25.280]  the last 16 years, you know, and I'm usually not, I'm usually not the sort of person who
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.120]  I just assume that there's almost nobody who reads everything I post, right? I, I don't
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.480]  expect anybody to, to be a completionist. I'm sure there's a handful of people who are
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:40.000]  and I know I thank them. I'm glad there's way more than a handful based, based upon
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.600]  like the feedback that I've gotten in my inbox. Like there are people that pay meticulous
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.560]  attention and there are a lot of them. Well, I think it's healthier though for us to pretend
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.160]  that there aren't right now. Don't assume that somebody is a complete, you know what
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.800]  I mean? Like it's, it's, but with the images thing, I sometimes get a little, I get a little
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.600]  sour about it. It's like, it's not that rare. When are you going to update your design?
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:11.720]  So it's like nice and responsive. Oh, it's like whatever. I was, let's open that can
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.960]  of worms a year ago, a year ago. I started promising people that it would happen by the
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:21.280]  end of summer because I thought if I publicly, I mean, if I publicly, you told me about it.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.240]  If I publicly promise on Twitter, that would make me do it, you know? And then it turned
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.040]  out summer was not, I thought, well, summer will be a good time cause there's not a lot
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.720]  of news and stuff and I can, I can have time. And then it like summer came and went and
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.440]  it didn't happen. So I don't know soon. I would like it to be, so I don't really, I'm
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.200]  not, you know, there is no, there is something, it is age related. I, there's no doubt about
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:54.320]  it where if the, if I, if I were my 30 year old self, it would be done already. It's,
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:05.000]  there is some part of me that is, I can tell is different and is more resistant to change.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.240]  Like I wish that it were so. I really don't. And the worst thing that ever happened in
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:16.440]  my opinion to it is that I've, when the iPhone first came out, forget what the meta tag is,
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:21.880]  but there was something that I, it was a very easy bit of meta tag that I could add to HTML
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.120]  that made it so that if you double tap on the text column, it pretty much looks like
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.760]  what, what it should look like by default when you load it. So you're really just one
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:36.560]  double tap away from it looking pretty good on an iPhone. And I think that's the worst
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.440]  thing that ever happened to it. I think it would have been better if my existing design
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:47.520]  just could not be made to look good on a phone cause then I would have to do it. It is bizarre
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:51.840]  though and it's, you're right to call me out on it and I really don't have a good excuse
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:58.680]  other than laziness, I guess. I don't know. It just never seems like, it's the same reason
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.280]  my office is a mess even though we just moved is it never feels like today's the day where
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:09.640]  I should spend all day decluttering my office. I could just, you know, there's real work
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:15.200]  to be done, which is dicking around on the internet and posting links. Right. Like I'm
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:21.520]  just, you know, it's like putting a healthy meal and some candy in front of a child. Like
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:28.400]  I always, the candy to me is posting stuff to daring fireball and I cannot, I can't resist
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:35.120]  it. Right. But I have no, I have no excuse for it. I don't know about you, but the iOS
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.880]  or an iPhone in particular is the majority of my traffic these days. Like if anything,
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.920]  I would buy the number of people on how much traffic I serve. I would be better off with
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:49.880]  an iPhone only design and showing the iPhone design to people on desktop browsers than
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:56.840]  the other way around. Just in terms of the, yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, that, that was,
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:04.120]  you know, my most recent design is, wasn't quite mobile first, but it was, you know,
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:08.720]  mobile in a tie for first, you know, with, with desktop as far as like how I thought
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:15.880]  about the design. Cause you know, like I don't think, I don't think the majority of my traffic
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:23.040]  is on mobile, but you know, it's, it's trending, it's trending that way. Certainly. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:29.360]  I don't have a good excuse. Does Jonas know HTML? Like can you get him on the, no, he's
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:37.760]  not, he's not interested. He's on a computer all the time. But he's really not, you know,
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.360]  and I don't think I'm a poor father. It's not like I haven't tried introducing him to
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:48.540]  it that he just doesn't really have an interest in coding and I don't know, you know, it seems
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:53.480]  like the sort of thing that could suddenly ignite, but I don't know. I know that by the
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:59.600]  time I was his age, I would have been all over it. It's just, you know, I don't know.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.360]  I don't know what to do as a parent sometimes in terms of how much to encourage him to do
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:08.000]  things that I think he should be doing and how much I should let him follow his own interests.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:18.040]  Totally. Yeah. I just like last week I just sat down with Ollie. He's 10 now and we installed
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:23.040]  a Swift playgrounds on his iPad. And so he played around with that and you know, he's
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:30.520]  done stuff like code.org and a little bit of scratch and what's the other one? I can't
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.240]  remember the name of the other one. But you know, he's done some programming stuff. So
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:39.760]  like he's aware of, you know, like loops and variables and functions and all that sort
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.360]  of stuff. And he's, you know, he's done it in several different types of programs. But
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:54.400]  he was like, daddy, I think, I think Swift is, is, is the best one. I was like, oh, interesting.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.960]  And you know, and I think one of the things that's really exciting to him is that like,
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.400]  I told him, I was like, okay, so like once you do code here, like you can put it into
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:07.040]  X code, which is this program that you can use to write actual like iOS apps. And he
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:15.280]  was like, Oh, you know, that was the thing. He was just like, Oh, geez. I, I tried, I,
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.120]  I didn't force Jonas to do the Swift playgrounds, you know, like the, you're talking about like
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.760]  the thing where you like the learning to code playgrounds where there's like a, it's like
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:28.120]  you're guiding a little video game character around a 3d landscape with like, turn left,
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:35.320]  turn right, go forward. Exactly. I had Jonas do it, I think last summer on his iPad as
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.560]  like, well, you know, in addition to like your summer reading, here's something you
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:47.640]  can do. You know, that's actually not just watching friends reruns on Netflix. And he
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:55.280]  did it, but he was sour about it and purpose, purposefully did it stupidly. Like instead
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.900]  of like when he got to the lesson about learning loops, instead of doing it in a loop, he'd
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:08.760]  just copied and paste four times and was sort of like, like doing, like doing them the worst
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.000]  way possible. And I was like, you know, that's not the right, that wasn't the right way to
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.080]  do it. It was like, I would say like, Hey, did you get through, you know, three or four
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.640]  playgrounds, you know, steps in the thing? And he was like, yeah, yeah, I'm done. And
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.400]  then I looked at his solutions and they were awful. And, and, and it was like, he was just
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.960]  doing it as fast as he could to get to watching friends reruns on Netflix. Right. And I was
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.600]  like, well, I'm not going to force it down his throat. Cause I feel like that it would
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:42.840]  have the opposite reaction. I got to wait for him to come to me. I'm also dreadfully
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:48.220]  fearful at this point that, that when I go to modernize the Daring Fireball layout, that
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:54.960]  it'll be so much less work than I'd been anticipating for years that it's that it'll make me feel
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.960]  bad.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.960]  I mean, everything is like, you have everything templated on the backend, right? Yeah. So
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.800]  you can just change like headers and footers and you know, this and that. Yeah. And yeah,
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.520]  that's probably, that's probably true. That's probably true. I, the other part, if I have
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.960]  a good excuse, the other part is that I would like to, like, I'm happy with the longevity
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:23.640]  of the current design and I would like to, with the next, the next redesign, I would
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.560]  like to have it be like, this is the one for the rest of my career, like just one more
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.880]  and you know, measure twice. But at this point it's more like measure 40 times, cut once.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:42.700]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a huge burden to put on, to put on yourself. Right. And yeah, and as
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:46.080]  evidence by the, I can see why you're stuck in the mud, spinning your wheels on this.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.480]  Right. I get in the back of my head, I've had this idea of, you know, and like you,
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.440]  you mentioned this in your 20 year anniversary post that you think you could go another 20
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.080]  years and I feel like I could easily go another, I would love to be doing this for another
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:04.880]  20 years. But thinking like, how do I make a design that'll last 20 or 25 years is it
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.520]  can be a little paralyzing. Like I really probably, it's not helpful at all to have
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:16.720]  that in the back of my head. Okay. So take it. Number one, take a vacation and leave
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:23.560]  your phone and you know, in the, in the safe and the hotel. And number two, like, you know,
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.480]  think simple about, about the redesign thing. That's my advice to you.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:36.200]  Ah, all right. You're probably right. How many times have you redesigned kotke.org over
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.560]  the years? And your redesigns have been truly significant. Like the redesign that I have
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.920]  envisioned for daring fireball is the least exciting. Like the colors aren't changing.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:53.080]  It would just be right. Update the fonts and update the sizes of the fonts and make it
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:37:00.080]  responsive more or less. Right. You, I mean, your task would be to make, to make the daring
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:09.300]  fireball design more of itself. Yes. And also, you know, of, of the present era, let's say
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:22.080]  charitably. No, I mean, I, I love the design of during five ball. It's like, it's like
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:28.680]  this constant in sort of this ever changing world of, of, of the web that, you know, changes
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:37.120]  all the time. But, uh, but I, yeah, I don't, I don't know how many times I've redesigned
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:45.120]  probably eight, six or eight, like major, major ones. I still think of the canonical
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:52.440]  kotke.org design as the one that had the, that ever so slightly greenish yellow banner
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:02.000]  at the top where the kotke.org part was in din. Uh, I don't know what era that is. It's
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.360]  probably somewhere around 2003, 2004, something like that. Yeah. Somewhere in there. Um, maybe,
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:14.220]  maybe even a little bit earlier. Yeah, maybe. Um, I always think of the, I always think
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:19.600]  of the concentric, you know, the concentric yellow, yellow one. That's, I think that's
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.520]  my, like when I look at that, I was like, I fucking knocked that out of the park. It
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.120]  was good. It was very good. You know what? I'm not, I'm not that kind of guy where I'm
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:36.040]  like, yeah, I did a good job. It's mostly, it's like that sucked and it, but it's done.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.840]  That was a good trick. It also, it's also a sort of thing that sounds like a terrible
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:45.400]  idea that you're going to have concentric color gradients around the entire four sides
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:52.080]  of the page. That sounds terrible to me, but you know, the way it actually turned out was
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:39:01.240]  actually, uh, it was like perfect. Just right. Yeah. Uh, all right. Let me take one more
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:06.860]  break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show. It's our good friends at fracture.
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:16.760]  You guys know fracture. Of course, fracture makes a handmade photo prints directly on
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.000]  glass. Here's the gist of it. If you haven't heard of them, you have photos that you've
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.920]  taken with your camera or iPhone camera, whatever other camera you pick your favorite ones,
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.400]  you send them to fracture, you go to their website, you pick a size from them. Could
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.240]  be really big. They've got really, really big ones that can fill up a whole wall. They've
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.480]  got really, really small ones that you can put on your desk or your mantle and they've
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.840]  got all sorts of sizes in between. They have square, they have rectangles. You, you put
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.600]  your picture, show it to that, you can send it to them, you pick your size, they send
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.500]  it to you and it's your photo directly on glass, not like a piece of paper that they
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:58.160]  glue to the glass. Somehow they print on glass. I don't know how they do it, but the effect
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:04.060]  is really, really impressive. And then what you can do with it, it's just edge to edge,
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:09.240]  corner to corner. There is no frame, there's no bezel. So like the whole direction like
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.800]  our cell phones are moving with these ever smaller bezels, like a fracture print is like
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.240]  the canonical ideal of where that's going, where it's just edge to edge picture and everything
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.120]  you need to hang it on a wall or prop it up like on a desk or whatever. It all comes in
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.240]  the cardboard box that the, that the print comes in. So you don't need to buy anything
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:35.800]  else to hang it up. They look so great and it is so fun and it's so great to get your
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:41.280]  pictures off a little four inch piece of glass in your pocket and actually see them really
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:48.360]  big. Like everybody, you know, like the megapixel wars in cameras are sort of over. Nobody really
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.400]  brags about megapixels anymore, but it turns out that like the 12 megapixel camera on your
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:59.340]  phone can take pictures that look really big, really good at an incredibly big size. Like
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:05.160]  you'd think no way would an iPhone picture look good at like a 20 inch picture. It turns
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.520]  out it looks great. You've got plenty of pixels to spare. And looking at your pictures really
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.760]  big is so, it's just, I don't know, it's just very different than looking at them on a little
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.480]  tiny thing that fits in your pocket. Cannot recommend it highly enough. And I always say
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.760]  this when fracture sponsors the site, they are, this is like the single greatest gift
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:31.940]  idea for family in the history of mankind. So like with mother's day coming up, father's
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:37.960]  day after that, getting fat fracture prints of your pets or your kids or just you and
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.560]  sending them to your family, your parents and stuff like that. It's just absolutely
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:47.240]  amazing in terms of how easy it is to take care of the nagging idea in the back of your
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.480]  head that you have to get a gift for your mom or whoever else. The cost effectiveness
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.480]  and then just how happy they make the people you give them to really is a great idea. So
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:02.660]  here's where you go to find out more. Just go to fracture.me and when you go to buy,
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:11.400]  you can say 15% on your first order with this exclusive code. Talk ta lk 15 the digits one
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:18.280]  five talk 15 and you'll save 15% and then don't forget to mention this podcast in there.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.000]  One question. Where did you hear about fracture survey? It helps support the show and helps
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:31.240]  them know where their ad money is well spent. So my thanks to fracture. What were we talking
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.200]  about? I always forget.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:43.360]  I can't remember. I was listening to the fracture thing and I don't have any fracture in my
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.080]  house and I think I probably need some now. You really should. It's amazing. I always
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.440]  think I have enough and then I was at Marco's house a while back and they literally like
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.100]  I know he says it went on there. The accidental tech podcast at their house is filled with
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:02.560]  fractures but it really is and it's kind of amazing. I mean it helps that Tif Armand is
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:07.440]  actually like a professional photographer like the pictures were actually like a lot
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:15.040]  better than my sort of ham-fisted prosumer level of photography but it's like one of
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.100]  those things that you really can't get enough of. There's no home that has too many photos
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:26.600]  of family members or places that you've gone etc.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:34.880]  Well we could talk business. I mean like one of the things that's challenging doing this
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:42.960]  and I think that so I'm a little disappointed at how few people do what we do like when
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.560]  I first went pro you went you know started doing cocky full-time in 2005 was a huge inspiration
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:57.600]  for me. I started in 2006 was the last time I had like a job job and I thought at the
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:07.300]  time that that we were ahead of the pack because we had the background that you know the technical
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:14.720]  background in that era to know about things like HTML and CSS and even just getting movable
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.920]  type installed you know you needed to be somewhat of a nerd and I thought you know it's no
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:26.760]  surprise that a lot of the early popular bloggers were people who had some level of technical
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:33.320]  acumen I mean Dean Allen wrote his own CMS textile or no textile was the format what
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:41.120]  was it called text pattern yeah you know Mark Pilgrim was a good programmer or is it still
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.200]  a good programmer it's no surprise that the people who were nerdy enough to sort of you
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:54.040]  know know what FTP is an HTML and we're the early ones and I thought well now that it's
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:59.420]  getting easier and easier to publish and you don't you know you can just go to wordpress.org
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:02.800]  and sign up and you don't have to know anything about web hosting and you don't have to know
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.380]  HTML and CSS that there will be more people who do this independent publishing thing is
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:15.060]  their occupation and it turns out no that didn't happen at all and if anything there's
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:27.380]  fewer people now doing it than before yeah I mean you know pro blogs were a thing before
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:34.200]  you know before I went you know before I went independent you know Gawker well Gizmodo was
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:43.400]  the first site and then Gawker was the second site and that was in 2002 so I you know I
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:47.240]  think there was an there was already in sort of an established thing where you could you
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:55.320]  could do you could do blogging professionally but you you know did it you know you were
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.800]  hired to do it like you know it was a media site and so like you were hired to you know
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.920]  be a blogger for someone else and that was sort of this established thing and and you
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:08.400]  know doing it by yourself was not you know you're right it was not really a thing and
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:14.460]  you know surprisingly few people picked it up afterwards but I do think it's interesting
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:23.080]  now like with especially with YouTube and Instagram there are tons of people who are
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:29.360]  doing what we do just you know in sort of you know different media like you know you
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:36.320]  know there are plenty of YouTubers making you know a living yes doing doing videos and
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.280]  and you know there's people on Instagram that that that make money doing you know sponsored
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.600]  posts and all that sort of stuff if they you know if you have enough followers and so I
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:51.440]  mean it's interesting it's it's it's like I don't know why blogs didn't take off in
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:57.600]  that way like independent you know independent pro blogs yeah I don't know either but YouTube
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:03.120]  is a fantastic counter example where it's there's probably an uncountable number of
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:10.240]  people you know individuals who are supporting themselves and in some cases you know very
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.660]  very well just doing their own YouTube channel that's a great example and I don't know why
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:22.600]  it's different I don't know there's something different about it but one of the well sorry
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:28.120]  and now it's sites like Patreon like you've got you know you've got people who you know
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.240]  that's that's you know you can you can so you can have a YouTube channel and you can
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.480]  run ads and you know Google will pay you what they think is what they think is right but
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.760]  you know you can also appeal directly to your viewers and and you know stick a page on Patreon
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.200]  and say hey like if you like this you you know you should support it and you know people
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.840]  are using Patreon for stuff like and also you know Kickstarter has a has a new thing
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:59.000]  called drip I think and you know people who write newsletters people who write blogs people
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.240]  who are you know do all of those sorts of things or who are freelance journalists like
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:08.720]  they're they're using that as a way to you know support their independent work and
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.400]  so it's it's interesting to see this kind of like boomerang background again you know
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.800]  yeah and that's exactly where I'm going with this where like just referencing back
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.400]  to the Drudge Report starting as a $10 a year email newsletter like email newsletters are
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.220]  back in a big way and that's one of the way people are you know supporting themselves
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:34.440]  individually Ben Thompson who's often on this show at Stratechery and a whole bunch
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:44.020]  of other similar sites where you know the basic formula that Ben kind of carved out
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:49.840]  is one time a week he posts the thing that's up publicly for everybody to look at but then
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.760]  the other days of the week it's a members-only email newsletter and the only way to see it
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.960]  is to pay and people you know because it's good people are willing to pay but what an
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:10.000]  old-school idea right I mean that literally you know you know Drudge was doing it in 1995
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.840]  before yeah the web was really even a thing anyway you one of the things and I think you
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:23.960]  started this last year where you re rebooted the idea of a membership system at cocky.org
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:30.160]  was it last year yeah it was in 2016 all right oh I forgot what year it was I knew it was
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:36.920]  2016 and I'd already forgotten that it's already 2018 so two years ago or what year
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.820]  and a half ago or something yeah a year and a half ago yeah and like you said like you'd
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:48.160]  tried a membership type thing in 2005 and I'd tried a membership type thing in 2006
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.280]  that was really ultimately just about selling t-shirts right but I did really well selling
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.520]  t-shirts like I literally could not have gotten Daring Fireball off the ground as a full-time
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:04.520]  job without that initial batch of t-shirts like I made like 30 grand from or at least
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:12.240]  I revenue was like 30 grand and like to stick because every single dollar counted instead
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:19.820]  of outsourcing any of it I did the whole thing locally and right Amy like every single person
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:24.320]  who bought like from the first two top first two years of me selling t-shirts your shirt
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:33.680]  was hand-packed by my wife and I would I had hundreds thousands maybe of t-shirts that
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:39.900]  I had to both ship get to my house from the local print shop here in Philly and then get
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:45.500]  to the post office with postage and for all the over out of the country ones with custom
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:52.000]  slips filled out by hand wow and all I had was a little Subaru Impreza not a hatchback
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.480]  like just like the smallest the smallest four darts sedan that Subaru made like it was absolutely
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:06.280]  not designed for boxes and boxes and it was just I'm sure there might have been a better
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.680]  way but I just remember I'd go I'd get to the post office and I couldn't do it like
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.560]  all in one trip I would just be as much as I could possibly stuff in the car at a time
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:20.520]  but then I was like with no one else to help me it was like I would have to park the car
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.080]  as close to the post office as I could get which in the city is often not that close
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:31.680]  and carry as many boxes of t-shirts as I could into the post office and hope you know trust
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:34.680]  that nobody was going to steal them while I went back to the car to get the rest of
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:40.500]  the boxes of shirts and then get in line and push like eight boxes of t-shirts up with
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:46.780]  me until I got to the counter and then one by one they would start taking taking and
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:51.080]  scanning these shirts and it was like I was like the guy you did not want to get behind
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.660]  at the post office right yeah I was I was just imagining like the people coming in behind
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:52:00.540]  you and saying oh my god who's this fucking asshole it was funny because I got to know
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:04.520]  there there were three women who worked at the post office I went to and there was two
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:10.880]  of them obviously did not want to deal with me and the third was very nice and very sympathetic
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:15.320]  and so you know it's sort of like like when you go to a barbershop but you know like instead
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.280]  of just going next if you've got you know like Tony is your guy you'll wait until Tony's
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.640]  free like I would wait until she was the next of it I would let people go ahead of me and
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:32.280]  until I got the one who I knew was going to be nice to me right and any but that does
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.760]  those initial rounds of t-shirt sales with me admitting publicly that hey I you know
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:42.520]  you know this is how I'm hoping to get this off the ground we're instrumental to it yeah
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:51.620]  no I I remember that and like it's still like a very unique approach but I never really
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:58.540]  did anything with memberships the only thing I did for members was that I at the time it
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:02.920]  for like a year it was the only way to get the full content RSS feed that you know like
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:07.780]  the right regular free RSS only had the headlines and like the first few words of a post and
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:12.800]  if you wanted everything you'd have to be a subscriber I don't I won't go into it because
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:17.560]  I talked about this at XOXO a couple years ago but how I accidentally stumbled upon the
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:24.900]  best business idea I've ever had which is long story short that the password protected
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:30.060]  RSS feeds never worked with Google Reader and I always thought I thought for a long
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:33.800]  time well eventually they will because of course it's you know it's a good and then
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.740]  I realized it suddenly dawned on me no they're never going to support password protected
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:43.700]  feeds because the whole point of doing anything at Google is to be able to do it at scale
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:50.260]  and there's absolutely no way that they want to hit my RSS feed a couple thousand times
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:54.860]  for a couple thousand paid subscribers they want to hit it once and give it to everybody
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:00.540]  and so they're never going to support password protected feeds and I everybody I kept getting
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:04.780]  email on a daily basis you know like very nice but like hey I use I've switched from
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:10.780]  whatever to Google Reader how can I get my full content feed to work and the emails were
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.120]  always of how do I get this to work because surely there must be a way to get it to work
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.040]  and I feel bad asking you but I couldn't figure it out and then I have to explain no it actually
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:24.800]  doesn't work and I thought well how can I still make money and make everybody happy
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.200]  and I thought well maybe I could sell a weekly sponsorship for the RSS feed and it turned
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:36.520]  out to be way more lucrative than the membership thing that it replaced yeah yeah so I completely
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:43.000]  stumbled into it accidentally and thanks to Google Reader which still is something of
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.600]  a sore spot for me at least in terms of when it went away you know I did we talked about
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.280]  this before too right like when Google Reader shut down traffic to during fireball dropped
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:55:02.720]  by a third and never recovered hmm I don't think I lost readers but I lost I lost regular
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.800]  like you know I don't think people dropped off but I think the number of times a day
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:14.480]  they hit the site dropped off right right I you know I didn't see that that sharp decline
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:22.900]  like that I mine has been it's been more steady and you know I think definitely Google
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:33.680]  Reader is a you know was a was a factor but more I think it's you know like mobile and
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:37.480]  you know Facebook consuming more and more people more and more people's attention yeah
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:42.920]  I still get a ton of traffic to the during fireball homepage surely you get a ton of
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:48.180]  homepage traffic like it doesn't make sense to me like when I look at newer sites and
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:54.220]  I get it you know like sites that have evolved or were created in the social media era where
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:59.560]  their homepage isn't even really a thing it's just you know right everything is the homepage
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:07.000]  right whereas you know I I still feel it works very well that like your site and my site
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.140]  all you all you have to do is go to the homepage and you can just scroll down for a while and
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.200]  then when you see the last post that you read before then you know you're done and you're
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.960]  caught up right yep like one page view every couple days is all I ask just come to my homepage
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:30.000]  once or twice a week and you can get everything like two page views a week that's great yeah
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.800]  well anyway you've relaunched into two years ago you relaunched the idea of memberships
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:43.640]  and it I think I mean it seems like it's actually pretty successful yeah I mean it's it's been
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:50.800]  great the the first time I did it in 2005 I did it and you know after a few months I
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:57.720]  started feeling you know and this was just sort of my own internal you know thing it
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.280]  didn't have anything to do with anyone else it was I started feeling like I had you know
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:11.640]  over a thousand people who are my boss now you know the the sort of paying paying patrons
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:20.920]  micropatrons I called them who you know had some more say in what I should be posting
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:29.640]  then you know the the usual reader you know and again like this was completely in my head
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:35.480]  like nobody was saying this you know I my inbox wasn't full of email saying like well
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.560]  you said you were gonna do this and you're not doing it what the hell's going on like
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:46.060]  none of that was happening it was just all in my brain and I you know I didn't like that
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:52.040]  sensation I didn't feel like I was sort of free to do what I wanted to do anymore which
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.780]  is sort of ridiculous because of course I was but you know I I sort of talked myself
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:05.360]  into you know feeling that way about it and you know so after a year like I I discontinued
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.600]  the membership thing and you know I think it was a couple months later where I put the
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:14.820]  the deck ad on site it was sort of this like oh shit this isn't gonna work and then the
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:26.360]  deck came along and I was like oh cool let's do this but you know increasingly you know
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:31.320]  probably like three or four years ago I started thinking I'm just like well what if I you
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.940]  know I'm a different person now like what if I went back and like did this membership
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:42.240]  thing like there's this you know I think patreon was just sort of becoming a thing and it seemed
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:55.360]  like there was this idea that content online was was worth paying for which you know back
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:59:02.840]  in 2005 was not really a concept that made sense to anyone like online things were free
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:06.840]  you know like the Wall Street Journal had a paywall but that was about it you know the
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:12.960]  New York Times experimented with paywalls like periodically and other sites you know
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:20.180]  other news sites did too but you know I think like you know especially like three four five
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:26.900]  years ago like people started coming around to this idea that that that huh like you know
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:39.520]  advertising is problematic to put it to put it gently and you know in some cases in most
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:48.200]  cases I would say and you know but so if advertising doesn't work like how are we you know how
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:55.320]  am I gonna read this thing like maybe I should support this thing you know and I think once
[01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:01.120]  that started happening I started thinking I was like you know I bet you know I bet I
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:07.080]  could I could do a membership thing again and feel okay with it and you know I would
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:12.400]  get probably like once every two weeks I would get an email from somebody saying like can
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.760]  I pay you for this like what the hell like why can't I pay you for this you know and
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:28.840]  I think that feeling of it being a more acceptable thing or something that was in the air of
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:35.600]  like oh we need to we need to you know pay directly for content you know that we love
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:41.720]  online and you know people wanting it was was just sort of hard to ignore after a while
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:42.720]  for me.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:50.800]  Yeah and so now you've got three levels patron for 30 bucks a year right superstar 60 bucks
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:59.280]  a year and then the crazy one 600 bucks a year and then what members get is a that the
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:04.000]  good feeling of paying you for the work that you're doing but then they also get a good
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:11.340]  old-fashioned email newsletter which is out of you know same type of thing that you post
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:19.500]  on khaki.org but different and you know more written longer and sort of a slightly different
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:25.200]  tone in my opinion right well there's there's um so there's so there's the members newsletter
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:32.800]  which I think I've only sent out probably like six or seven of maybe eight it's not
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:40.460]  past year it's not spam it's not spam it's not spam and then that you know there's there's
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:46.080]  a separate newsletter that that I started with Tim Carmody in December I think called
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:51.720]  noticing and that's you know that is obviously member supported but you don't have to be
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:02:01.640]  a member to read it I mean my my thing is that like they're like I was very I didn't
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:07.200]  I didn't want to have any sort of members only stuff or very little members only stuff
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.120]  I wanted people to know up front that they were supporting the work that was already
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:18.520]  going on right and that part of part of their contribution was going to make sure that that
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:24.560]  stuff stayed open and free and available you know and it's it's part of the whole deal
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:31.680]  you know it's it's it's not a it's purposefully not a paywall yeah yeah I'm personally I think
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:37.200]  I think what you said is exactly how I feel like I I think like what Ben Thompson does
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:44.360]  it's trajectory is it you know fantastic I love getting his emails and I think he's you
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:49.640]  know built a very successful business at it but it would drive me nuts writing because
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:55.660]  the better the piece was that was behind the paywall the more I would wish it weren't behind
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:03:04.840]  the paywall mm-hmm like there's a part of me that I if I write something like it's again
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.280]  like me feeling like I was born at the right time I love that everything I write and posted
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:16.920]  during fireball is there for anybody in the world to see like it's it it I can't explain
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.460]  it but it's it's just a part of my personality that it I'm just not cut out to write behind
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:26.600]  a paywall like it would just drive me crazy it would it would bother me like knowing that
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.720]  I've lost my keys like I can't stop thinking about where they might be like if I had a
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.180]  post behind a paywall I would never be able to stop thinking boy I wish that weren't behind
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:45.120]  a paywall yeah that I mean that that that's exactly my my feeling on it too and you know
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:53.000]  there's something I think there's something about I don't know what it one of the you
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:01.800]  know the the web brought with it all of these new possibilities in thinking about how people
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:09.560]  do things and and things like that and one of those things was you know you can write
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:17.740]  something and put it online and anybody who wants to stop by to read it can read it and
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:24.720]  share it with others and you know at a certain point like I mean I I loved I loved that about
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:31.960]  the web and it's just I think doing you know something like putting something behind a
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:41.160]  paywall is just not it just doesn't feel like the right thing to do with the web for me
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:47.560]  and I do think you're right that like in 2005 it was an idea ahead of its time and I think
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:55.040]  fundamentally based on the fact that in 2005 2006 it still felt like everybody agreed that
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:00.360]  everything on the web should be quote unquote free and something changed in the decade after
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:05.080]  that and I think part of it is just that in the ensuing decade people have seen things
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:15.000]  that sites that they loved before either either go away completely or mostly dry up and I
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:23.920]  think it gave people like the having had sites that they loved go away you know I think it
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:28.840]  made made people more willing to say I would like to keep this going and and if I can help
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:36.040]  by giving 30 bucks a year or whatever I'm happy to do it I think that's what I mean
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:40.080]  the difference is whether they're happy doing it or not and I think in 2005 there weren't
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:44.560]  very many people who were happy about paying for anything online whereas today there are
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:51.640]  yeah I mean you know you like you look at the last five years in online media and you
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:58.720]  know it's it's like just the the consequence of not paying directly for things and sort
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:05.280]  of relying on advertising and you know VC money is you know like there are a lot of
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:10.680]  advantages to both of those things but the disadvantage is that when those things dry
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:18.440]  up for one reason or another like that thing that you loved is gone you know yeah whereas
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:26.400]  like I feel now with you know sort of this you know the the membership is is you know
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:34.520]  more than 50 percent of my revenue now and I feel like in a lot of ways like that is
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:41.280]  way steadier than advertising ever felt yeah like I feel like a large chunk of that is
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:50.400]  going to be there for ever a long time I mean it just feels so solid to me and it's like
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:59.040]  it's so it's such a base you know that I can that I can count on yeah it just feels
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:06.880]  amazing talking about early era bloggers I think he started sometime after you but it
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:14.120]  was before during fireball would be josh marshall at talking points memo and he's evolved tpm
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.640]  in a way that's you know very you know certainly different than what I've done where he's
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:23.960]  built it out into a real news organization with a staff of I think somewhere around like
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:32.720]  20 people you know it's a real publication but it's also very small by the historical
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:37.880]  standards of a news publication it's still like if you're regular reader of talking points
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:42.560]  memo you you kind of you know you can just see by how few bylines there are that it's
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:49.320]  you know it's a small group it is still in a way personal and you know they've done the
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:55.920]  same thing where they call it tpm prime but they you know get the their their thousand
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:01.280]  true fans or you know several thousand biggest fans to sign up for tpm prime and they do
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:05.560]  have some paywall stuff but their news articles the you know the heart of their reporting
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:11.400]  they do aren't behind in a paywall it's sort of like you get to see like the reporters
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:16.680]  notebooks if you're effectively if you're a member but I think for the most part it's
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:24.240]  driven by people who really just are happy to pay it to keep tpm afloat and or not even
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.800]  afloat not like they were in trouble but and josh has written about it but that it just
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.420]  makes him feel better about their business if fifty percent of the money isn't from advertising
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.800]  if it's direct support from readers it just like you said it just feels like this is something
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:42.320]  that they can bank on as they try to hire more reporters and stuff and they don't have
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:47.460]  to worry about the ebb and flow of the ad industry that if they've got these readers
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:51.480]  who subscribe for an annual thing that they can count on you know as long as they're doing
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.360]  the good work that they were doing to get them to sign up in the first place they're
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:00.720]  going to be able to count on it going forward right yeah and I mean it it's interesting
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:08.680]  like I didn't anticipate that it would feel differently like that and it also feels differently
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:14.640]  from a perspective of like what I write about and how I write about it like I feel I feel
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.360]  way more free to just sort of write about I mean I've always written about anything
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:26.000]  and everything but I feel you know there was never the sense that I was writing for page
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.680]  views but it was always like a little bit in the back of my mind and now I don't worry
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:40.920]  about it at all and I also don't worry about I'm worrying less about if things are on the
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:52.120]  site or not like if if I wanted to I don't know like if I wanted to increase my you know
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:10:00.480]  Twitter activity a lot I could do that because you know the people who are paying for the
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:09.160]  site are paying sort of for my activity in general and so like you know it's hard to
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:14.320]  talk about it it's it's it's really I feel like it's really freed me up to to do different
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:19.040]  stuff to think about it in a different way I don't know it's it's it's it's hard to talk
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:27.000]  about I well from the outside I mean we're friends but we don't talk often because I'm
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.400]  bad at being friend I so I can't say it's not like we don't know each other personally
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.000]  but from my you know primarily though my interaction with you is reading your website and vice
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:48.720]  versa and I've noticed it seems to me that since you launched this that and you know
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.560]  and then you indicated that hey this was you know this was even more successful than I
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:59.160]  thought it would be thank you everybody who's on board I've noticed that it seems like it
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:06.200]  seems like you're in a better mood just judging you from the post on cocky.org you know and
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.520]  you know that could just be me I don't know and and also that it seemed like it freed
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:17.080]  you up to change things a little bit more I think yeah I mean you know the like launching
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:26.200]  the newsletters is I think a good a good example of something that I don't know I I'm not sure
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:30.000]  I would have thought about it because it was like oh shit I gotta figure out how to fund
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.320]  this thing like okay I need to get sponsors for it so like we need to get it up to a certain
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.200]  level you know and I'm still thinking about those things because you know I think one
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.000]  of the one of the things I've learned is that you need to have multiple sources of income
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.760]  in case you know one goes flat and all this other stuff you know it's always good to diversify
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:56.400]  but you know the newsletter is definitely one of those things and you know I think you
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:03.080]  know going to you know what you said about me being happier I definitely you know I definitely
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  feel more energized you know I think the the membership thing is really energized me and
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:19.160]  really maybe that's what's more maybe that's a better word too than what I detect on the
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.360]  website energized yeah that I mean that's how I've sort of been thinking about it as
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:27.440]  as I've you know and I didn't notice it right away but I've definitely like in the last
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:32.120]  few months particularly you know and maybe there was this thing of like me taking the
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:38.240]  site for granted a little bit for a while and I think that's kind of in the rearview
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.360]  mirror a little bit and I really like I'm I don't know I'm just really back into it
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.000]  in a way that I wasn't maybe you know three four years ago you know and there was some
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.320]  like personal life shit going on too that really like drove my life into the ditch for
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:13:01.960]  a couple years but you know and and you know katky.org was this thing that was you know
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:08.880]  sort of the through line that that I could depend on even when the rest of my life isn't
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.440]  you know shit like this is the thing that I know how to do and I can sit down and do
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:19.180]  this and you're in control of yeah exactly I feel that way about I absolutely feel that
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:27.200]  way about daring fireball when real life is you know not that great I always I do I you
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.080]  know in some ways when real life isn't that great sometimes that's when I'm more productive
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:40.320]  at tearing fireball just because it's something I can hide away from everything else yep I
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.920]  help it feel a little personally slighted by this though on your membership members
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:48.960]  page the first level of the patron it's here's the description for pennies a day this is
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.520]  a thirty dollar a year membership for pennies a day you can become one of katky.org one
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:02.440]  thousand true fans please don't make me have to start a rambling two-hour podcast yeah
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:12.600]  yeah we're at like the 215 mark yeah so I can you should feel a little slighted by that
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:19.040]  but at the same time like it you know it's it's it's funny I I have never I'm not a big
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:26.760]  podcast guy I'm not a big podcast listener I you know and and my sweet spot for podcasts
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:37.480]  is like you know 20 to 30 minutes right you know as a listener so yeah sorry I have found
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:44.160]  I could be wrong I have found that I think it I think the worst length for a podcast
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:54.920]  is about an hour because when the talk show episodes were shorter I'd get a lot of complaints
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.520]  about the length from people who thought it was too long because there's an awful lot
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:04.160]  of people who they like you said 15-20 minutes is the sweet spot and you know remember our
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:13.720]  sponsor the tech meme ride home show which is 15-20 minutes if people want it one way
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.640]  or the other and it's like that nobody wants the middle bowl of porridge they either want
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:25.480]  it cold or they want it hot and there's other people who can't get enough you know who you
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:28.460]  know when I talk have an episode and talk about length of the show they're like make
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:33.760]  them longer there it's you know I have a really terrible commute so right please make them
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:40.880]  longer and come out with them more frequently well it's interesting as a as a guest so I
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:47.000]  I've done I've probably done like three or four podcasts in the last like month just
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.400]  because I kind of made a concerted effort to reach out to people and people have been
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:56.440]  reaching out to me because of the you know the anniversary thing right and I did one
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:02.720]  with Craig Maud he does this podcast called on margin yes margins I can't remember which
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:08.040]  it is which he hasn't posted yet because he's you know like me he's like this meticulous
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:17.160]  like he meticulously meticulously edits these episodes to within an inch of their life but
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:22.280]  it was interesting I talked to him I think for about an hour and I felt like we were
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:26.200]  just kind of getting going like we were just in a good place where it's like oh okay like
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:31.640]  we're we can really have a conversation now and then he was like okay we're done and you
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:38.000]  know we talked for 20 minutes after that and you know we should have hit record again probably
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  but you know it was it was interesting that that that that hour wasn't enough as a guest
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.360]  you know and I did I did you know all the other ones that I've done I think have been
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.600]  around you know 40 minutes to an hour and it was just sort of like oh we were just we
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:17:00.480]  were just getting somewhere well you don't have that problem with me no I and what what's
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:08.720]  interesting about this is that I mean this is I don't know like we talked a little bit
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.360]  like I texted you yesterday and I was like okay well can I do anything to prepare and
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:19.760]  you're nope you're like nope okay and then like like 10 minutes before the show you're
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:26.080]  like okay here's my skype I was like oh we're doing this on skype all right and then you
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:31.840]  call me on skype and you're like hey how's it going good okay can you record this yep
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:37.840]  hit record okay and then it was and then boom we're in and I was like okay I didn't want
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.560]  to make you nervous I and it is weird because I tend to rotate between regular guests who
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:47.120]  know how it goes and I would like to have more like one of my things I'd like to do
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:56.720]  this year is have more uh fresh voices on this show and um I I realized as I was doing
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.200]  it I was like oh I bet I bet Jason's freaking out a little bit uh just because I know you
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.280]  don't do this a lot um but I was completely confident because I've done this I knew exactly
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:10.640]  how it would go like this yeah and I knew it would be pretty good um and I think it has been
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.280]  um but I still can't help but feel that a rambling two-hour podcast is
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.320]  yeah that was that was maybe a shot across the bow
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:26.080]  uh this has been great but we have gone long enough I think it's a more enough rambling
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:33.360]  all right uh but I I will promise that I you will have to come back at some point and yeah
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:41.040]  that'd be great not let 200 episodes go by um so for anybody who wants more if you don't know
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:48.800]  kotkey.org I don't know how that's possibly the case uh but that's Jason's website uh on twitter
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:55.680]  there are two twitter accounts that I know of uh there's at kotkey which is sort of like the
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:01.920]  official links you know like the twitter account for the site and then there's j kotkey which is
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:06.400]  your personal twitter right everything's kotkey branded it's sort of like trump
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:10.320]  yeah jesus did we have to end on that note
