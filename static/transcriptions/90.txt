[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  No, seriously, do you do you do you wear polarized sunglasses? I have sunglasses
[00:04.400 --> 00:08.720]  I don't even I don't think they're polarized because I buy I buy the cheapest ones possible
[00:09.280 --> 00:15.640]  Because I sit on them and I lose them. And so I gave up buying nice ones polarization. I don't I'm not an optician
[00:15.640 --> 00:21.200]  I'm not an optics guy, but the basic idea though, it sounds kind of crazy. Do you know what that how they work?
[00:21.200 --> 00:30.080]  They're like blinds like horizontal blinds on the lenses. They're there, you know, I don't even think that you can see them with the naked eye
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.680]  But the idea is that it makes your glasses like blinds and then without reducing visibility it reduces glare
[00:36.480 --> 00:42.000]  And so like for example, like people who work on the water like fishermen
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.360]  Love polarized sunglasses because it cuts down on the glare from the water in front of them, right?
[00:49.360 --> 00:56.440]  Um, but you know, if you have polarized sunglasses or not because if you look at your iPhone it it or any kind of like LC
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.940]  Oh, it looks different. It looks crazy. It's like all rain. So then I do then I do. Yes
[01:00.940 --> 01:05.580]  I do have polarized you do have polarized is that I must cuz my phone looks looks freaky
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.560]  and at first the first time I noticed that I thought that it was something wrong with the phone and
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.360]  Then I realized I had bought new sunglasses
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.600]  That's exactly it's exactly how how this came to my mind
[01:19.600 --> 01:24.320]  I actually what happened is out. I had Marco Arment on the show last week and
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.880]  I want I heard an episode of his show from weeks ago where he was talking about the Warby Parker
[01:31.820 --> 01:33.820]  glasses and
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.200]  Sunglasses and said that he likes polarized sunglasses and I thought in the middle of listening to the show. That's crazy
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.660]  How can someone you know who uses an iPhone all the time as I presume Marco does
[01:44.660 --> 01:51.540]  Use polarized sunglasses like to me the debate between whether you get polarized sunglasses or not is over now that we carry
[01:51.860 --> 01:56.740]  iPhones with this all over the place because it looks bad on your iPhone. It makes your iPhone look crazy
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.700]  I go makes it look odd to me. It makes it look unreadable. I
[02:00.380 --> 02:06.300]  could not bear to use my iPhone with sunglasses on and yet I have my sunglasses on and I use my phone out and
[02:07.460 --> 02:09.460]  What do they call that daytime?
[02:09.460 --> 02:13.500]  And I wanted to talk to Marco about it
[02:13.500 --> 02:16.120]  But we ran short of time because we did a quick show
[02:16.180 --> 02:22.020]  So I didn't get to bring it up to him and is the effect the same in the casino. I would bet that it is
[02:23.140 --> 02:25.020]  given that
[02:25.020 --> 02:30.060]  Given all the video poker machines. I'm just trying to think of where you would be most likely to be using them
[02:31.500 --> 02:37.220]  Well, and then the further confusing it in the casino is you know, if you start seeing wavy lines and stuff
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.660]  You're never quite sure if it's your glasses or
[02:40.580 --> 02:42.580]  How long have I been here?
[02:43.940 --> 02:45.940]  Yeah last time I saw the Sun
[02:49.420 --> 02:51.420]  Was that guy next to me smoking
[02:53.140 --> 02:56.660]  You just never know what what it is that's causing the wavy lines in Vegas
[02:57.380 --> 03:01.380]  but anyway, that's actually what happened to me today that reminded me that
[03:01.380 --> 03:07.340]  To bring it up with you because I didn't bring it up with Marco is that a couple weeks ago?
[03:07.340 --> 03:10.140]  I had Amy's old first original
[03:11.020 --> 03:13.420]  iPod out the one with the wheel that actually spun
[03:13.980 --> 03:18.820]  Just I don't know for old times sake and I think it was because it was like some kind of I don't know
[03:18.820 --> 03:23.780]  Yeah, honestly, I got it. I sure wasn't there. Yeah, I got it out posted a picture on Instagram got you know
[03:23.780 --> 03:26.620]  A couple hundred likes would it be it's a beautiful device
[03:26.620 --> 03:32.140]  It really is it looks ancient now because it's so crazy thick because it has a big hard drive in it. But yeah
[03:34.140 --> 03:38.620]  But I had it out and it's in my was in my office here next to my desk next to next to a window in
[03:38.620 --> 03:43.700]  The sunshine and Amy was in here telling me something before she ran out for an errand and she was like, why did you leave?
[03:43.700 --> 03:45.460]  This because it's hers not mine
[03:45.460 --> 03:50.180]  Actually, that's the other thing that she got mad at me when I posted the Instagram because I made it look
[03:50.180 --> 03:54.840]  I didn't say anything on Instagram and she says that's mine. Not yours
[03:54.840 --> 04:02.120]  And and said there, you know, there I'm Jack you jacked her image. Yep sleeping on the couch for three nights. Yeah
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.440]  but then she got mad at me because I wrecked it because I left it out in the Sun for a couple of weeks and
[04:08.440 --> 04:13.700]  I looked at it and I was it didn't really look weird to me and and then she goes. Oh, is that these sunglasses?
[04:15.800 --> 04:20.260]  Because it actually made it made the original iPod with her son with her
[04:20.260 --> 04:27.460]  Polarized sunglasses it made it look as though it had a color screen like like, you know, like a rainbow. Yeah
[04:27.620 --> 04:33.900]  Yeah, I was like, oh well that would have now that I'd actually would have been to me if you borrow your wife's original
[04:34.640 --> 04:38.580]  2001 iPod and literally wreck it it was it you know, it still works
[04:38.580 --> 04:41.460]  That's the thing that's amazing to me is that if you can find a firewire cable
[04:41.460 --> 04:48.460]  It still works if I had actually wrecked it that would justify some anger. So you're you're okay going blind as long as you can
[04:48.460 --> 04:54.580]  Continue to look at your going blind in the long term as long as you can continue to look at your iPhone
[04:55.060 --> 05:01.420]  With crystal-colored clarity right now. I don't think non polarized unpolarized whatever the word is normal
[05:01.840 --> 05:08.140]  Sunglasses are driving me blind. I I think it's you know, just you have to put up with a little bit more glare. I
[05:11.060 --> 05:13.060]  Actually am
[05:13.060 --> 05:18.940]  You might be in the same situation. We're of similar vintage. I actually am having trouble start
[05:18.940 --> 05:22.100]  I'm starting to get the presbyopia whatever it's called. Yeah
[05:24.140 --> 05:29.880]  In my left eye not my right eye though, which I don't know if it's better or worse I got it
[05:29.880 --> 05:31.880]  I got it all through my body
[05:32.060 --> 05:37.020]  What's it called? Is it presbyopia? I looked it up a little bit and I got I got scared and stopped
[05:37.020 --> 05:40.740]  I had I had to find I had to finally buy a pair of those cheaters
[05:40.740 --> 05:42.740]  uh reading glasses
[05:43.420 --> 05:46.300]  Just like cheap grocery store ones. How do they work?
[05:46.860 --> 05:52.140]  What does it what did they do? It just makes it easier to see things close to you. How did I thought that?
[05:52.140 --> 05:54.140]  I always thought they just magnified
[05:54.140 --> 05:58.180]  It's good. Yeah, I mean, that's well, it's the same thing. Yeah, but that's what that's what
[05:59.020 --> 06:00.940]  glasses
[06:00.940 --> 06:02.940]  reader glasses do
[06:02.940 --> 06:09.540]  Yeah, you guys you can see I'm really well-informed about yeah, we should really be having this conversation
[06:11.220 --> 06:17.720]  Ophthalmology so but you wear contacts I do. Yeah, so do I and it's like I'm practically blind without them
[06:17.780 --> 06:20.140]  Alright, so I think that's what I think that long-range
[06:20.140 --> 06:22.140]  That's what I think I need to do is I need to
[06:22.220 --> 06:27.220]  Get get like some kind of pair of glasses that I take around with me and put them on to read. Yeah
[06:27.220 --> 06:34.420]  It's a problem in restaurants now in low-light situation, yeah trying to read it trying to read a menu it's like
[06:36.220 --> 06:40.500]  It's just and I know I know now what my parents went through and why they
[06:41.380 --> 06:44.860]  So he seems so annoying just put the damn glasses on and I know
[06:45.420 --> 06:49.360]  No sympathy for my dad when he went through it at all. No, yeah, right
[06:50.260 --> 06:56.700]  I remember when my dad got his first pair of my dad wears glasses and and it has his entire adult life
[06:56.700 --> 07:03.100]  I believe I don't like I don't think I've seen a picture of my dad without glasses on since he was like a teenager
[07:03.660 --> 07:09.260]  I remember when he got bifocals and he really was struggling with them because it's weird
[07:09.260 --> 07:11.340]  You have to like hold things at a weird angle and stuff
[07:11.340 --> 07:16.100]  And he was like lifting them on lifting them off and I I had no sympathy for him
[07:18.360 --> 07:24.260]  Making fun of him. Yeah, I gotta look this up the arrogance of youth
[07:24.260 --> 07:27.300]  What's it called it's like presbyopia or something, I don't know
[07:28.420 --> 07:30.420]  Presbyterian
[07:30.740 --> 07:32.740]  No, I think it's presbyopia
[07:34.580 --> 07:36.580]  Yeah, presbyopia
[07:36.740 --> 07:44.180]  Usually occurs beginning around age 40 when people experienced blurred vision near vision when reading sewing or working at the computer
[07:44.740 --> 07:50.820]  Karen Karen got it before I did and she started wearing she'd never won glasses and her vision was perfect, which I always found
[07:50.820 --> 07:56.100]  Irritating to begin with and then she also kept saying things like I think it'd be kind of cool to wear glasses
[07:56.100 --> 07:58.100]  I think I'd look good in glasses
[07:58.420 --> 08:04.020]  You're not going out and getting like blank glasses to wear just to look like just stop it
[08:04.260 --> 08:06.260]  but then she got the reader glasses and
[08:07.460 --> 08:12.500]  Like the first first time I saw her wear it. I'm just like I go in go in she's lying to bed
[08:12.500 --> 08:15.700]  She's reading a book with those glasses on I'm like, oh, hey
[08:15.700 --> 08:20.260]  We had a kid in high school we had a kid name in high school i'm not going to name names I
[08:21.140 --> 08:27.940]  I'm 99.9 percent. Sure. He does not listen to the show. Um, but you know, why name a name, but he was
[08:32.740 --> 08:37.300]  He came in wearing glasses one day in high school, I don't know 11th grade 12th grade and you know
[08:37.300 --> 08:41.700]  So you don't want to say anything you want to be the you don't want to be the guy, you know, you don't want to be
[08:41.700 --> 08:47.300]  The guy, you know who makes fun of someone because they start wearing glasses. I actually had to start wearing glasses in high school
[08:47.300 --> 08:49.700]  I I also got contact. So most of the time
[08:50.580 --> 08:52.580]  I I didn't look different but
[08:53.140 --> 08:57.060]  Um, you know, I just you know, you don't want to be mature about it. You don't want to act like a fifth grader
[08:58.180 --> 09:01.380]  But like within a day or two it turned out that he didn't have prescription glasses
[09:01.380 --> 09:06.420]  He he he just had glasses and he and he literally said I think they make me look smart
[09:06.420 --> 09:12.180]  And then we just tore into him. I mean, of course. Oh, it's like off to the races because all of a sudden instead of making fun
[09:12.180 --> 09:16.020]  Of somebody for having you know, yeah a legitimate problem you can yeah
[09:16.580 --> 09:20.260]  Well, i've had bad eyesight since fourth grade. So, you know, I don't want to hear it
[09:20.740 --> 09:24.900]  Like I've you know, i've had to live with i've had to live with this pain for a long time
[09:25.780 --> 09:31.540]  You're gonna just wear them because you think they look good. I've told this story before this is one of the this might be the funniest
[09:31.540 --> 09:33.540]  Thing that ever happened to me in my life, you know
[09:33.540 --> 09:39.140]  I think i've told this story on this show before but I bet it was years ago. So why not rehash it? It was sixth grade
[09:40.260 --> 09:42.580]  And this kid dwayne i'll name him dwayne
[09:43.380 --> 09:49.940]  Dwayne, and I got sent down to the nurse together for the annual kids go down two by two and you got to get your eyes checked
[09:50.500 --> 09:55.940]  Right and you I don't know why they send you two by two. I don't think the nurse was very good with children
[09:55.940 --> 09:58.100]  So she couldn't handle very many at the time
[09:58.980 --> 09:59.940]  and
[09:59.940 --> 10:06.020]  so I the lights are real low in the room because it's set up for like eye exams and there's a chair to wait and it's
[10:06.020 --> 10:10.980]  About halfway like between there's like a piece of tape on the ground where you stand and then there's a standard eye chart
[10:12.420 --> 10:17.700]  And she said, you know who wants to go first and dwayne dwayne went first I took a seat I took a seat
[10:17.700 --> 10:23.220]  I'm halfway to the sign and I thought well, you know what this would be so easy to cheat because it means the way my brain
[10:23.220 --> 10:24.740]  works is
[10:24.740 --> 10:29.300]  Look i'm halfway there. I got to go down to the nurse. I got to go down to the nurse
[10:29.300 --> 10:31.620]  I'm halfway there. I can just memorize the bottom line
[10:32.500 --> 10:34.500]  um
[10:34.820 --> 10:38.980]  I don't know. That's all that's so i'm thinking about you know, how why wouldn't they you know?
[10:39.380 --> 10:42.180]  Proctor this exam a little bit more on the up and up
[10:42.900 --> 10:44.420]  In the meantime and remember how they used to do it
[10:44.420 --> 10:47.620]  They'd like have you have you read and it was the same thing every year
[10:47.620 --> 10:51.460]  You have you know, see which line you can read cover the other eye do it with the other eye
[10:51.940 --> 10:57.540]  And then they at our school they used to give us a pair of glasses and they were they're like they look like warby parkers
[10:57.540 --> 10:59.060]  now they're like
[10:59.060 --> 11:03.060]  I guess you know, they're like what looks cool now like black chunky glasses, but like in the 80s
[11:03.140 --> 11:07.540]  They were the worst glasses you can imagine and they were real thick and it was the same pair
[11:07.540 --> 11:11.140]  They just put them on and then what do you see and when you know when i'd put them on?
[11:11.300 --> 11:15.380]  It's like you could almost see nothing. I mean like the whole world just it's like vaseline on your eyes
[11:16.180 --> 11:20.740]  And you know, this is the sixth grade same school all six years. So it's like the sixth time i've done this
[11:21.380 --> 11:25.940]  And i'm sitting there and i'm you know bored and i'm listening and and she's like what about this row?
[11:25.940 --> 11:32.100]  What about this row and dwayne can't see any of the rows. He couldn't even see the big e at the top
[11:34.340 --> 11:38.740]  And I started giggling and then then she had him cover his other eye
[11:39.460 --> 11:43.540]  And it was the same thing. He he couldn't read a damn thing on the eye chart
[11:44.180 --> 11:46.980]  And I I was just dying. I was like, oh my god
[11:50.660 --> 11:52.500]  He's like blind
[11:52.500 --> 11:56.740]  And then she goes what if you try these on and she gives him this pair of glasses that everybody had to try
[11:57.220 --> 11:59.220]  And he goes, oh wow
[12:02.100 --> 12:05.940]  And I just died I just like fell out of my chair laughing and
[12:11.300 --> 12:13.300]  Wayne has not seen the the board
[12:13.300 --> 12:21.460]  Right three years and the nurse turns to me and she goes do you think something's funnier and I said he can't see anything
[12:25.140 --> 12:29.220]  And he had dwayne had good parents, you know, I think his mom was even a nurse, you know
[12:29.300 --> 12:35.540]  And nurses kids are always you know, it's not like he didn't have health care or anything. I just like never reported it
[12:35.620 --> 12:37.220]  He never like noticed
[12:37.220 --> 12:42.420]  And somehow he I don't know if he had had a really bad year between fifth and sixth grade if he'd you know
[12:42.420 --> 12:45.140]  Been absent the year before when they did the same thing
[12:46.260 --> 12:50.980]  But lo and behold like two days later. Dwayne comes in wearing the thickest glasses
[12:55.620 --> 12:57.460]  Oh my god, yeah
[12:57.460 --> 12:59.460]  hank's got glasses, too
[12:59.460 --> 13:05.780]  Um, he doesn't have to wear them that much as it's I say it's pretty pretty good. It's just mild but uh, is it distance or close?
[13:06.580 --> 13:07.620]  distance
[13:07.620 --> 13:08.980]  and
[13:08.980 --> 13:13.380]  Man, the first the first pair that he got were uh was with spider-man glasses
[13:14.020 --> 13:17.780]  Oh, I remember seeing a picture of him with those. That's a cool. Yeah, they were they were and they were awesome
[13:17.860 --> 13:19.700]  They were very subtly spider-man
[13:19.700 --> 13:26.520]  The case was was kind of spider-maned up, but the uh, the glasses themselves looked like sort of warby parker-ish
[13:26.980 --> 13:29.940]  except they just had a little like spider web on the uh,
[13:30.740 --> 13:32.740]  on the things on the side
[13:33.220 --> 13:34.740]  I thought oh man, i'd wear those
[13:34.740 --> 13:40.180]  I see a lot more kids at jonas's school wearing glasses than when I was a kid when I was a kid it
[13:40.660 --> 13:45.780]  It just seemed pretty rare. There were only a handful of kids who wore glasses. Yeah, it seems pretty common
[13:45.860 --> 13:50.020]  I can't even wait to see what happened to these kids. You know, they say that standing, you know being a
[13:50.980 --> 13:54.740]  Foot away from a glowing computer screen for hours a day is bad for your eyes
[13:55.140 --> 13:57.860]  Can you even imagine how much worse it's going to be for these kids?
[13:58.500 --> 14:03.540]  I can't even imagine. Yeah, our kids are going to need corrective surgery because I feel like with us like we were
[14:03.540 --> 14:06.180]  I mean even when we were playing video games like in an arcade or something
[14:06.260 --> 14:11.060]  I mean the the the crts were so fuzzy you didn't really have to focus that what that closely
[14:11.380 --> 14:13.220]  Yeah, I think that was good for us
[14:13.220 --> 14:15.220]  And you couldn't afford to play for you know
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.700]  As long as they can now
[14:20.020 --> 14:24.020]  I always think of that. I do think of that whenever the people complain about the in-app purchases
[14:24.020 --> 14:28.740]  It's like do you realize how much money it cost me to play video games? I worked as a teenager
[14:28.740 --> 14:35.780]  I worked at a video arcade and oh man, man, I just I spent I spent everything you peeked early the place
[14:36.420 --> 14:41.220]  But the cool thing was I had the key to the place left without a paycheck every week
[14:41.860 --> 14:45.940]  Yeah, basically, but I had the key to the place and so like on saturday night
[14:46.020 --> 14:47.540]  I would take my friends
[14:47.540 --> 14:50.340]  and when it was closed and we would just go down and open it up and
[14:50.660 --> 14:55.140]  Lock the door and just stand there and play video games. What was your favorite video game in that arcade?
[14:55.140 --> 15:00.740]  Uh, what my favorite of all time. I'm not sure if it was in that one or not was tempest. Oh, that's a good game
[15:01.300 --> 15:05.700]  I loved all the ones still love that all the vector of vector art games. Yeah
[15:06.900 --> 15:09.700]  Yeah, those were all good. Yeah star wars
[15:10.580 --> 15:12.900]  Yeah, the star wars one battle zone
[15:13.540 --> 15:17.060]  Battles and was it? Yeah, I guess asteroids was vector graphics, too
[15:17.700 --> 15:22.900]  Uh, never really thought about that. But now that I think about the way that asteroids looked it. I think it was yeah
[15:22.900 --> 15:25.940]  And there were a number of asteroids rip-offs that were pretty good, too. Yeah
[15:27.940 --> 15:31.540]  Uh, I remember my favorite neighborhood arcade growing up
[15:32.500 --> 15:35.940]  uh had spy hunter always a favorite and uh
[15:36.500 --> 15:38.500]  Yee are kung fu
[15:38.500 --> 15:45.380]  That that that's that I know dan benjamin and I talked at length about yee are kung fu years ago on on the show
[15:46.260 --> 15:52.100]  He was a big fan. You remember that game. I don't because I missed that phase. Yeah, that's what I remember
[15:52.100 --> 15:54.100]  Yeah, that whole that whole fighter
[15:54.740 --> 16:00.100]  Thing came a little bit after my time yee are kung fu was like one of the first ones you
[16:00.820 --> 16:08.100]  Google it after the show and you'll see from the graphics quality that it was it was pre like street fighter. Yeah
[16:09.460 --> 16:13.220]  It was a lot more like pac-man era graphics
[16:13.860 --> 16:14.820]  um
[16:14.820 --> 16:19.940]  Even had like the I know it was made it might have been made by the same company as as pac-man because it had that same
[16:19.940 --> 16:21.940]  Same exact same high score font
[16:22.660 --> 16:24.660]  um
[16:24.900 --> 16:30.660]  Same basic idea though where you fight, you know, two guys fight side by side, but it was it was an older older version of it
[16:31.060 --> 16:33.060]  great game
[16:33.620 --> 16:35.620]  Oh, man arcades
[16:36.660 --> 16:38.580]  Anything going on this week
[16:38.580 --> 16:40.260]  No, I don't think so
[16:40.260 --> 16:43.060]  All right. Let's i'll take a break. Let's get it out of the way. Let's do a sponsor
[16:43.780 --> 16:47.620]  One of our great friends. Let's let's talk about backblaze
[16:47.620 --> 16:49.140]  Long time sponsor of the show
[16:50.100 --> 16:56.660]  What do they do easy unlimited unthrottled backup for your macintosh computers?
[16:57.780 --> 17:00.260]  Uh, what do you mean unlimited doesn't matter how much you have to store
[17:00.820 --> 17:04.980]  If you can get it through the internet to their servers, you can back it up
[17:05.300 --> 17:09.220]  Might take you a couple weeks took me a couple weeks to get my whole thing backed up. It's all right
[17:09.380 --> 17:13.860]  It'll it for me. There's like a 30-day free trial no credit card required
[17:13.860 --> 17:15.860]  No credit card required. Um
[17:16.580 --> 17:18.580]  You'll probably if you have any kind of decent bandwidth
[17:18.580 --> 17:22.180]  You'll get it up before the end of the you'll get everything up before the end of the 30 days
[17:22.740 --> 17:26.500]  Uh doesn't matter but then once you do once you have that first backup up
[17:27.140 --> 17:29.940]  Uh, everything else is incremental. Of course doesn't take long
[17:30.820 --> 17:36.660]  And while it's backing up you can uh, you can even use it. You can start to use it with whatever
[17:36.740 --> 17:38.740]  It's already been backed up
[17:38.740 --> 17:44.340]  Uh, but what about getting it back? Here's the thing. This is one of the stats that they've given me
[17:44.420 --> 17:51.220]  They've just crossed the six billion files restored mark in other words in the aggregate users of backblaze
[17:51.700 --> 17:56.340]  Have restored six billion files. It's amazing
[17:57.220 --> 18:00.180]  They have over 100 petabytes of data backed up
[18:00.980 --> 18:07.860]  One petabyte is a thousand terabytes and a terabyte is huge. So they've got tons of storage
[18:07.860 --> 18:09.620]  They've restored tons of files
[18:10.260 --> 18:12.340]  Uh, and it's great software you can
[18:12.980 --> 18:17.540]  You can restore one file or all your files. You can do it over the web
[18:18.020 --> 18:22.100]  You can pay them to put everything on to a hard drive and ship it to you
[18:23.380 --> 18:25.380]  Anything you'd think that an online
[18:26.180 --> 18:33.460]  Has everything backup system could do backblaze does founded by ex-apple engineers. It's really great native software
[18:33.460 --> 18:40.660]  For your mac, there's no add-ons. No gimmicks. No additional charges five bucks a month per computer
[18:41.300 --> 18:45.540]  Five bucks a month. I've been talking about this for a while. This is the best five bucks a month you can spend
[18:46.420 --> 18:50.840]  Great great service. Here's where you go to find out more go to backblaze.com
[18:51.860 --> 18:55.060]  Slash daring fireball. They'll know you came from the show
[18:56.900 --> 19:01.380]  And you know just start no credit card required just just go there sign up
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.380]  backblaze
[19:04.420 --> 19:12.180]  So what have we crossed off the list so far polarized sunglasses yes arcade arcade games oh and pres by opiate
[19:15.460 --> 19:17.460]  Well, here's the weird thing I didn't know this
[19:18.100 --> 19:24.180]  Is um, so like with my left eye it's if I close my right eye, I actually really I ought to be honest
[19:24.180 --> 19:27.380]  I can't read my iPhone anymore if it's just with my left eye
[19:27.380 --> 19:30.820]  If I close my left eye, I can read it with my right eye just like i've always
[19:31.540 --> 19:35.860]  Done before and for some odd reason with both eyes open. It looks even better
[19:35.860 --> 19:40.580]  I don't know at some I don't know how that works even though my left eye can't focus it
[19:41.300 --> 19:44.260]  It somehow looks better in my head with both eyes open
[19:46.580 --> 19:51.300]  But obviously if it just happened in my life if it's happened in my left eye in the past year my right eye is probably uh,
[19:51.700 --> 19:53.700]  I don't know whatever it is in there in there
[19:53.700 --> 20:01.220]  Whatever mechanism it is in there that lets you focus both at long distance and short range. It's it's probably all rusted out
[20:02.740 --> 20:05.300]  It's like a like one loose screw in there
[20:08.740 --> 20:11.220]  Yeah, it's like the millennium falcon hyperdrive
[20:14.260 --> 20:15.060]  I
[20:15.060 --> 20:19.540]  I had no idea but I thought too I would the thing is is that a distance my left eye
[20:19.540 --> 20:24.020]  Was also a little blurry. Um, and I thought oh, I just need a new prescription
[20:24.260 --> 20:26.740]  And so I went to the eye doctor and got in there like yep
[20:26.740 --> 20:30.580]  Your left eye got a little worse since last year. You need a new prescription. Here you go
[20:31.300 --> 20:38.980]  Here's a sample contact lens. Try this out tried it out and and close distance stuff got worse like way worse and I was like
[20:39.300 --> 20:40.100]  Uh-oh
[20:40.100 --> 20:43.860]  So I went back and needed it takes a lot for me to go back to a doctor and I was like
[20:44.020 --> 20:48.500]  Uh, I didn't I just thought I had to go back to a doctor and I was like, uh, I didn't I just thought
[20:48.500 --> 20:53.140]  I didn't I just thought everything was blurry and and I got this new thing and I have to tell you I see great at a
[20:53.140 --> 20:55.140]  distance with this new contact lens
[20:55.140 --> 20:58.260]  but like reading is worse and the eye doctor looks at me and he's like
[20:58.740 --> 21:00.740]  Uh, yeah
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.140]  He's like that's how it works
[21:03.140 --> 21:08.740]  Like the stronger the stronger the near-sighted, uh prescription is the worse it makes the
[21:09.860 --> 21:10.820]  the
[21:10.820 --> 21:13.220]  Inability to focus at close levels, right?
[21:13.220 --> 21:19.460]  So now i'm so old that I have to choose between uh, what I want to be able to see
[21:20.020 --> 21:21.140]  Yeah
[21:21.140 --> 21:24.340]  It's pretty sad. I just I know just I they at this point
[21:25.300 --> 21:27.300]  and any
[21:27.300 --> 21:32.260]  Any native culture worth its salt would have just piled some sticks around me and just left me there
[21:33.300 --> 21:35.300]  Continued on without me
[21:36.580 --> 21:38.580]  Just left a little marker
[21:38.580 --> 21:41.860]  Just so I could pass away peacefully without being eaten by the animals
[21:46.420 --> 21:51.780]  So yet here I am i'm 41, uh, I think yeah 41, uh,
[21:53.060 --> 21:58.900]  And i've always felt I felt so good for years that derek jeter is still playing now derek jeter's one year younger than me
[21:58.900 --> 22:04.020]  He's 40, but he's still the starting shortstop for the new york yankees and he's retiring after this year
[22:04.740 --> 22:06.740]  I cannot however
[22:06.740 --> 22:08.740]  I cannot however
[22:09.460 --> 22:14.580]  Much better, you know physical condition derek jeter has always been in me as
[22:15.220 --> 22:18.980]  Him being a world-class athlete and me being a guy who sits in a chair
[22:23.700 --> 22:30.660]  The the difference at age 40 41 is profound he's still the starting shortstop for the yankees and I can't read my iphone
[22:30.660 --> 22:32.660]  So
[22:34.660 --> 22:40.100]  Like I really feel like this is the beginning of the part where you just everything you I just start falling apart
[22:40.900 --> 22:45.060]  Yeah, i'm turning an age this year. So I uh, I decided to
[22:45.700 --> 22:47.700]  If I was ever going to get back in shape
[22:48.740 --> 22:52.660]  Or get in shape of any kind it was 10 years ago start. I need to start
[22:52.740 --> 22:54.100]  Yes, I need to start a long time ago
[22:54.100 --> 22:59.700]  But now like that's now for sure I need so I started exercising again and and I went to the doctor
[22:59.700 --> 23:07.380]  And I had everything i'm having everything done. Wait, you did have every possible every possible test is being is being run
[23:08.260 --> 23:10.980]  some of them some of them will take you know months to
[23:12.100 --> 23:15.540]  Complete can we do a special episode of the talk show with a camera for this?
[23:17.300 --> 23:22.740]  Nobody wants that nobody wants that I think this could be a very special doctor doesn't want to be there
[23:22.740 --> 23:27.780]  Nobody I don't want to be there your listeners definitely don't want to be there
[23:29.700 --> 23:34.420]  Did you see that saturday night live skit this year about the guy who asked his doctor if he could check if he has a
[23:34.420 --> 23:36.420]  Darth vader up his up his butt
[23:39.220 --> 23:46.660]  I don't want to spoil it. It's just it's worth it though. Just honestly i'm just gonna write down here at google. Uh, yeah
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.700]  Snl darth vader up my butt
[23:49.700 --> 23:54.980]  Speaking of star wars. Oh, man, going to doctors is fun. Yeah. Yeah speaking of star wars
[23:56.100 --> 23:57.620]  new x-wing
[23:57.620 --> 24:01.380]  Which is what everybody's talking about even though that the whole thing was supposed to be about a charity
[24:02.020 --> 24:09.220]  Exactly. I thought of that too after I leaked it. Hey, look at the x-wing and it really sounds like a great cause like a truly great cause
[24:14.660 --> 24:16.660]  I think it's awesome
[24:16.660 --> 24:21.620]  I think that these little teasers where they're shooting them on these practical sets and I know that they said
[24:22.180 --> 24:25.940]  You know, it was a thing. They said when they announced they were going to do episode seven
[24:26.580 --> 24:30.500]  And they were going to you know with jj abrams directing and they even said right up front
[24:30.500 --> 24:31.540]  We're going to you know
[24:31.540 --> 24:37.140]  We're going to dial a little back on the computer graphics and dial it back up a little bit on the practical special effects
[24:37.700 --> 24:41.860]  But actions speak louder than words and just seeing something like a little bit of a
[24:41.860 --> 24:49.460]  practical special effects, but actions speak louder than words and just seeing something like a real full life-size x-wing is
[24:50.100 --> 24:52.100]  awesome, right
[24:52.660 --> 24:55.060]  Because I remember a story when we were kids
[24:55.780 --> 24:58.340]  And I don't know if it was after all three movies
[24:58.900 --> 25:03.940]  Or just after you know somewhere in the run when star wars was you know, the original trilogy was being made
[25:03.940 --> 25:08.020]  I remember seeing a story in a magazine about a guy, you know, and they built, you know practical sized
[25:09.380 --> 25:11.060]  x-wings
[25:11.060 --> 25:17.000]  And it might have been like like 19, you know after the 77 1977 original and some guy in california
[25:17.220 --> 25:19.460]  Bought one of them and put it in his backyard
[25:19.620 --> 25:25.240]  He like, you know, he just like bought it and there was a guy who had like a life-size x-wing in his backyard
[25:26.100 --> 25:28.100]  And I as a kid
[25:28.100 --> 25:31.300]  All I could think is that is the coolest thing i've ever heard in my life and I
[25:31.540 --> 25:34.500]  If I had that I would go in and sit in the x-wing every day
[25:35.060 --> 25:36.100]  Yeah
[25:36.100 --> 25:38.180]  Now as an adult I look back and I think
[25:38.180 --> 25:40.900]  Like I can see being stupid enough to buy it
[25:43.220 --> 25:47.780]  If I had a backyard that could fit it and I could see being stupid enough to pay someone to put it there
[25:48.660 --> 25:53.620]  And then the next day I would wake up and think what the hell am I going to do with the x-wing in my backyard?
[25:53.700 --> 25:57.060]  Because it doesn't but oh, what did I buy last night?
[25:59.220 --> 26:02.020]  So a couple of years ago or maybe a little bit more
[26:02.500 --> 26:06.980]  There was a project going on to build a full-size millennium falcon
[26:06.980 --> 26:10.500]  And oh, I saw that they were like building it in the forest or someplace
[26:10.900 --> 26:14.420]  Yeah, I can't remember where they were doing it, but they had like they had bought some land
[26:15.540 --> 26:17.060]  And they were building
[26:17.060 --> 26:20.580]  A full-size millennium falcon. I wonder I wonder like what did they do?
[26:21.460 --> 26:26.500]  With like the full-size millennium the real full-size millennium falcon they built back in
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.500]  77
[26:28.500 --> 26:29.460]  uh
[26:29.460 --> 26:32.260]  I presume they kept it around for the next two movies
[26:32.260 --> 26:38.500]  and so that like the one you saw in empire was the same one and was i'm not sure was there ever really a full-size one built
[26:38.500 --> 26:39.460]  because
[26:39.460 --> 26:43.300]  Hmm, they might have just done the door and done the rest with a matte painting
[26:44.740 --> 26:51.620]  I think that like i'm not sure there's there's something pretty big in in the scene where you know, they're loading up. Um,
[26:53.140 --> 26:58.580]  Yeah, I don't think it's a matte painting. I think that I don't know if it's truly full-size and articulated from every angle
[26:58.580 --> 27:02.340]  but the but the one in most isley where you know, um,
[27:03.380 --> 27:08.100]  They're getting on the ship and all of a sudden it's like a race against time because the stormtroopers are setting up
[27:08.580 --> 27:10.580]  They come in and just set up guns
[27:12.980 --> 27:14.180]  Um
[27:14.180 --> 27:16.180]  But that's a there's clearly a pretty big
[27:16.820 --> 27:21.300]  Pretty big physical thing there, you know, yeah and like think about it like when they're in
[27:21.300 --> 27:28.500]  Uh shooting off the minox inside the dinosaur in the asteroid in the next movie and end it on hoth
[27:28.580 --> 27:32.740]  There's a pretty big, you know, like when chewy's up there fixing it. Yeah, there's a big millennium falcon
[27:33.540 --> 27:36.580]  Again, it may not be articulated on all sides. I don't know
[27:37.540 --> 27:43.700]  But visually the millennium falcon was represented by several models and external and internal sets for star wars
[27:43.780 --> 27:46.740]  A partial exterior set was constructed and the set
[27:46.740 --> 27:50.980]  Dressed as docking bay 94 and the death star hangar
[27:53.380 --> 27:58.100]  Oh, do you think did they were they not able to move that and then they they they changed
[27:58.660 --> 28:01.220]  The most isley docking bay to become the death star
[28:02.020 --> 28:05.540]  That would be cool. Oh, maybe I bet that maybe they did. Is that what that says?
[28:06.020 --> 28:09.320]  Is that what that says? It would be yeah because docking bay 94
[28:10.100 --> 28:15.540]  That was the one that was the most isley, right? Yeah, but it does say partial exterior set. Yeah
[28:15.540 --> 28:16.820]  so
[28:16.820 --> 28:19.620]  So anyway new x-wing, I think it's pretty cool. Yeah
[28:20.980 --> 28:26.580]  I'm kind of i'm kind of pro these movies. I know some people are concerned
[28:27.220 --> 28:30.340]  I think a lot of people our age have a
[28:31.300 --> 28:33.220]  Subscribed and it's a sensible
[28:34.020 --> 28:38.740]  Maxim but the fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
[28:39.140 --> 28:44.180]  And so they are not going to get excited about the new trilogy until until after it comes out
[28:44.180 --> 28:46.420]  Until after it comes out no way. No, how
[28:47.380 --> 28:49.540]  I think there's no chance that it's not going to be better
[28:50.660 --> 28:52.100]  than the last three
[28:52.100 --> 28:55.940]  And the and the last three left such a bad taste in my mouth that i'm happy to have
[28:56.900 --> 28:58.500]  pretty much anything
[28:58.500 --> 29:02.740]  I'm, I I got confused by your sentence because of the two negatives, but I agree
[29:03.380 --> 29:06.420]  Right. You said there's no chance that it's not going to be better
[29:06.580 --> 29:10.580]  Which means it has your what you're trying to say has to be better has to be better. Yes
[29:10.580 --> 29:16.360]  Yes, I think that I agree. I know larry kazdins is involved on the screenplay
[29:18.660 --> 29:22.420]  Abrams is good. Yeah, you know, I think abram's worst movie is
[29:22.980 --> 29:28.900]  Better than than those. Yes. I we've said this before i've said this numerous times whenever star wars comes up on the show, though
[29:28.980 --> 29:32.260]  You have to understand though that for like our kids generation
[29:32.900 --> 29:33.940]  the
[29:33.940 --> 29:38.740]  The they're all blurred together my son jonas still has no idea which ones are the old ones and the new ones
[29:38.740 --> 29:44.340]  And I'm like, how can you not tell the difference that there are three movies that are very very different
[29:44.740 --> 29:48.020]  And that when I was your age, we thought return of the jedi was the bad one
[29:49.220 --> 29:52.020]  And now we think oh that was a great movie. Yeah, really
[29:53.940 --> 29:55.940]  Hank still has not seen the prequels
[29:56.980 --> 30:00.420]  You're hardcore. I am I yeah, I mean for the
[30:01.220 --> 30:05.220]  He's not as he he loved the clone wars tv series. Yeah
[30:05.780 --> 30:06.980]  and
[30:06.980 --> 30:08.980]  He's seen the the first three movies
[30:09.620 --> 30:14.100]  And then I was like and then I was finally I was like, okay if you want to we could watch the other movies
[30:14.100 --> 30:15.380]  He's like no
[30:15.380 --> 30:18.500]  You answered you and john syracuse are like the founders
[30:18.500 --> 30:18.660]  Yeah
[30:18.660 --> 30:23.700]  but for a while it was it was a very when he was really kind of into he was into the movies themselves for a
[30:23.700 --> 30:26.660]  While before he got into the the clone wars show
[30:27.460 --> 30:33.300]  And I think at that point he asked he it was he asked a lot of questions about the other three movies and I was like
[30:34.500 --> 30:36.260]  Like they're not any good
[30:36.260 --> 30:38.260]  Well, we don't have them
[30:41.140 --> 30:43.140]  They don't exist
[30:45.620 --> 30:48.660]  I do I worry I worry about uh
[30:49.380 --> 30:51.700]  Those movies because they came from the same guy
[30:52.500 --> 30:55.380]  and it's you know talking about getting older, you know, and there's there's um,
[30:56.580 --> 31:00.420]  I don't even know how true this is. I'm not a doctor but they say that like, you know, I for
[31:01.380 --> 31:04.180]  Within every few years every single cell in your body
[31:04.180 --> 31:07.460]  Dies and is replaced throughout the cycle of life
[31:07.780 --> 31:13.700]  So like I don't know within like 10 years every cell in your brain has died and been replaced, you know
[31:13.700 --> 31:16.740]  And I you know, I think hopefully you know that they you know
[31:16.740 --> 31:19.860]  the reason you can have any kind of memories that last longer than that is that
[31:20.820 --> 31:22.820]  I don't know the way shit gets stored is
[31:23.700 --> 31:29.940]  You know, like hey i'm i'm going out i've got a memory of uh dig dug in 1984 and then a new
[31:30.260 --> 31:32.580]  Neuron comes in and goes. All right. Got it. I got it
[31:32.580 --> 31:34.580]  right
[31:35.140 --> 31:38.340]  But I don't know there is something nice job enjoy your retirement
[31:38.500 --> 31:41.940]  there is something that happened to george lucas as he got older that is
[31:42.660 --> 31:46.260]  Just very I mean he might be it seems like a very nice man
[31:46.420 --> 31:48.980]  And you know, I think he's had a very happy life
[31:48.980 --> 31:54.100]  but as an artist the guy that the guy who made thx 1138 eventually made
[31:54.820 --> 31:55.540]  uh
[31:55.540 --> 32:02.660]  The phantom menace is just mind-boggling and that it wasn't because uh, it's like a work for hire, you know, it's like I you know
[32:02.740 --> 32:05.620]  Got to do it for the money. It's like he funded the whole thing himself
[32:06.580 --> 32:08.900]  Like he got to do it exactly as he wanted
[32:10.340 --> 32:17.220]  Like he he set everything up like and that's what was so that to me is it was why those movies were so profoundly disappointing
[32:17.300 --> 32:20.900]  Was that he it always impressed me that that
[32:20.900 --> 32:26.100]  In a very different way than like stanley kubrick that he he was a guy who wanted to do things his own way
[32:26.580 --> 32:31.700]  Outside the studio system, you know, I always thought it was cool. Everybody knew you know, he wasn't los angeles-based
[32:31.700 --> 32:37.460]  He was in northern california and nobody else was up there making movies and that he he created this
[32:37.940 --> 32:43.860]  Amazing franchise that and and set up the licensing in such a way that he got all the money from it
[32:44.100 --> 32:48.100]  So then he would never have to go to the studios for money to make a movie again
[32:48.100 --> 32:53.060]  movie again, he could just make whatever movies he wanted to and then he made they used it to make howard the duck and
[32:53.220 --> 32:55.220]  the phantom menace
[32:58.260 --> 33:00.420]  Yeah, I mean he had no one to answer to other than himself
[33:01.380 --> 33:05.940]  Jonas watched howard the duck at his grandparents house. Uh, oh my god, really?
[33:06.580 --> 33:10.420]  A couple of months. How did that happen? I don't know. I asked him it was like
[33:11.060 --> 33:13.140]  He was there he was being babysat for the you know
[33:13.140 --> 33:17.540]  Weekend being watched for the weekend while amy and I are away and I don't know like it was on netflix or something like that
[33:17.540 --> 33:19.540]  And they're like, well, let's watch that
[33:19.540 --> 33:21.540]  it's about
[33:21.860 --> 33:25.540]  And I tried to explain to him that it was from the guy who invented star wars and he wouldn't believe me
[33:29.620 --> 33:32.820]  So we're a half an hour in we should probably talk about apple eventually, yeah
[33:33.460 --> 33:36.580]  Hey financial results came out today. Yep. They sure did
[33:37.940 --> 33:42.180]  Uh, well today for us not today for the people the suckers listening to this later in the week
[33:42.180 --> 33:47.780]  Um, it's probably not going to come out till thursday or something people should listen to this live. I mean, I don't know why
[33:47.780 --> 33:51.540]  I don't why they don't yeah, should I do that? You know the atp guys have that
[33:52.180 --> 33:54.020]  um
[33:54.020 --> 33:57.940]  And it is helpful as i'm listening to atp
[33:58.740 --> 34:04.260]  And they either make a mistake or they can't think of something that they don't have to interrupt themselves and google it
[34:04.260 --> 34:07.780]  They just keep their eye on the chat and say but you know, right?
[34:07.780 --> 34:12.420]  It's kind of amazing and it sort of reminds me of like the podcast
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.860]  equivalent of like on a like on a live tv the way the anchor always has an earpiece and
[34:18.100 --> 34:21.300]  A director or somebody off stage can tell them things, you know
[34:21.300 --> 34:26.660]  So that because so that the person who's on air doesn't have to interrupt the show
[34:27.220 --> 34:29.620]  Right, like it works and I remember having it with
[34:30.740 --> 34:34.020]  The old talk show with dan benjamin for a while not a long stretch
[34:34.020 --> 34:39.140]  But for some stretch we had like an irc channel or something like that and it was occasionally helpful
[34:40.580 --> 34:45.220]  I don't think I could do it though because I think the reason it works for atp guys is that they record on a
[34:45.860 --> 34:50.420]  Very regular schedule, you know, there's like I don't know. Yeah every wednesday night at nine eastern
[34:50.420 --> 34:55.140]  They're on and right. I don't think i've ever recorded two episodes of the show at the same day and time
[34:56.980 --> 34:59.620]  Right. Yeah, I can I can vouch for that
[34:59.620 --> 35:05.940]  I can vouch for that like sometimes the ones that i've been on i'm gonna get you up at midnight because i'm a i'm
[35:06.340 --> 35:11.860]  Wide awake. It's 3 a.m. Eastern, but it's only midnight out there. Are you good to go? You're like and you're always like, yeah
[35:15.700 --> 35:22.180]  Remember do you ever I I do you remember being disappointed I was disappointed when I found out that like the tonight show wasn't live
[35:23.780 --> 35:26.340]  Yeah, although, uh, well, let's see
[35:26.340 --> 35:28.660]  Growing up. I mean growing up in new york
[35:29.460 --> 35:33.380]  Set like saturday live was live. Yes. Yes, which was great
[35:34.020 --> 35:36.020]  That was that was always
[35:36.020 --> 35:38.020]  crazy and it was always great to see them crack up and
[35:39.780 --> 35:42.340]  Stuff like that. Those are always the moments that you remembered
[35:43.620 --> 35:46.340]  But yeah, but but that was basically
[35:47.460 --> 35:51.300]  Well, I guess no they're all like that like letterman's not live, you know, nobody's live anymore. Yeah
[35:52.180 --> 35:54.180]  The tonight show used to be live
[35:54.180 --> 35:58.340]  And on the east coast and then I think at some point in the 60s
[35:59.140 --> 36:05.060]  They switched or maybe it was when they moved to california in the 70s when they moved from new york to california in the 70s
[36:05.060 --> 36:07.060]  Maybe that's when they switched. Yeah
[36:10.340 --> 36:12.340]  And it just felt like a bit of a cheat
[36:12.980 --> 36:19.700]  Right, but then I started thinking of it as more like knowing like a magician's magic trick like at first it ruins the illusion
[36:19.700 --> 36:22.660]  And then you think hey, this is pretty cool. These people they're clearly playing the game
[36:22.660 --> 36:29.540]  Pretty cool. These people they're clearly pretending they don't lie. They don't tell you it's live, but they're acting as though it's late at night somehow
[36:30.900 --> 36:32.900]  Yeah
[36:34.180 --> 36:39.300]  But that was weird going to I went to a letterman show once went back when he was on mbc
[36:39.860 --> 36:42.580]  And it's like yeah, it was like at four o'clock in the afternoon or something, right?
[36:43.300 --> 36:47.540]  Not late night at all. But yeah, but it's but they kind of I mean they they tongue in cheek
[36:47.540 --> 36:51.380]  He does he does like a tongue-in-cheek thing pretending that it's that it's a night, you know
[36:51.380 --> 36:53.380]  But he has to stay up until 11 o'clock
[36:54.020 --> 36:56.020]  right or like
[36:57.140 --> 37:02.100]  Like like on election night he'll make jokes like as though he knows who won the election. Yeah
[37:07.460 --> 37:09.380]  So, uh
[37:09.380 --> 37:11.380]  Financial results came in
[37:11.860 --> 37:14.100]  Is that where we were on? That's what we were on
[37:14.740 --> 37:19.140]  Uh, I hardly really looked at them. It seemed like they were more or less kind of sort of
[37:19.140 --> 37:23.220]  In line not chalking financially good iphone's
[37:23.940 --> 37:28.420]  Pretty good a little bit. I think iphone a little higher than expected. Yeah
[37:29.700 --> 37:35.380]  Margins are still great higher than expected and that was that's been the thing like that
[37:35.860 --> 37:41.940]  That during the rundown of the stock like the the great 2013 apple depression
[37:42.660 --> 37:45.620]  Was always about the margins that the margins are going to collapse
[37:45.620 --> 37:49.940]  They can't you know, right and and part of it was because they'd had a run
[37:50.660 --> 37:55.220]  For a couple of maybe even over a year where they had insanely high margins
[37:55.540 --> 37:59.780]  I think maybe who knows if it was how much of it was just remember when they bought all the the
[38:00.580 --> 38:04.020]  Ls led lcd screens and a bunch of ram in advance
[38:05.140 --> 38:10.900]  It was like somehow like that bet paid off huge and they had like 40 something percent margins for a while
[38:11.300 --> 38:14.740]  Yeah, and part of it was just that that was a fluke in terms of being high
[38:14.740 --> 38:19.540]  And they kept saying it was a fluke like, you know, this was all you know, we'll take the money
[38:19.540 --> 38:22.980]  But this is a surprise they're normally that they should not be this high
[38:23.620 --> 38:25.780]  And then part of it was you know, just you know
[38:26.500 --> 38:28.340]  Bad luck that it, you know went down a little bit
[38:28.340 --> 38:31.700]  but then I know there was a lot of speculation for a while that the margins were gonna
[38:33.060 --> 38:35.860]  Compress I think is what they say. Yeah
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.980]  but now
[38:39.140 --> 38:41.540]  And the only it's like the only real
[38:41.540 --> 38:46.580]  Question is the ipads are down again. Yeah ipads down euro. Well, it's two things
[38:46.580 --> 38:53.220]  I think and I think that maybe they're related. I don't know ipad is down 10 year over year or nine percent
[38:53.540 --> 38:57.060]  Oh, really? Well, all right. I think so. Well max are up
[38:57.700 --> 39:05.540]  18 percent and max being up 18 percent is even more impressive because according to most like idc and other
[39:05.860 --> 39:10.020]  You know people who track the whole industry the industry as a whole is still up
[39:10.020 --> 39:12.580]  The industry as a whole is still down two percent
[39:13.140 --> 39:14.500]  For the same quarter, right?
[39:14.500 --> 39:17.140]  so in an industry where like windows pcs or
[39:17.620 --> 39:21.780]  I guess including the mac including all mac and windows, you know, who knows?
[39:21.860 --> 39:26.820]  So windows is you know, all windows pcs must be even worse if the mac is down even further, right, right
[39:28.980 --> 39:33.860]  And I think that's kind of surprising because I feel like a couple of years ago when the ipad was, you know
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.980]  2011 2012 when the ipad was early days and and was clearly a hit
[39:38.980 --> 39:42.660]  I think that everybody was including me was sort of thinking about how
[39:43.540 --> 39:47.860]  How is this as the ipad gets more powerful and more popular and more familiar?
[39:48.420 --> 39:54.180]  How is that going to affect mac laptop sales? So it's probably going to you know be like a sort of slow decline
[39:54.900 --> 39:58.100]  And it seems like that's the other way around. I don't know
[39:59.060 --> 40:00.020]  Yeah
[40:00.020 --> 40:04.020]  Yeah, that's it's interesting. I don't know exactly. I mean, I think well, I think some of the
[40:05.140 --> 40:06.740]  negativity about windows
[40:06.740 --> 40:09.780]  Machine sales is windows 8. Yeah
[40:10.820 --> 40:16.500]  It's just not I mean often those kinds of upgrades drive sales and it's having almost you know
[40:16.500 --> 40:22.360]  it's having a negative effect this time because everybody hates it I really just don't think if you went back to like 2011
[40:22.900 --> 40:27.460]  And early days the tablets and you know mobile phones, you know growing gangbusters
[40:27.460 --> 40:32.500]  I just don't think I would have believed that come 2014. The mac would still see 18
[40:32.500 --> 40:37.140]  Yeah, I I I wouldn't have thought that either
[40:37.780 --> 40:39.140]  Does my heart
[40:39.140 --> 40:42.340]  Well, though because you know, it's great to see the mac doing well. Yeah
[40:43.460 --> 40:48.660]  I liked that ad did you like that the stickers ad? Yeah. Yeah, I liked it a lot
[40:49.300 --> 40:52.260]  yeah, and I noticed that I mean like that that little flash of the old, uh
[40:52.820 --> 40:56.980]  Icon the old logo is great. The the old logo came up twice
[40:56.980 --> 41:02.980]  So this is a new commercial that apple they call it a short film. It happens to be exactly 30 seconds long
[41:04.500 --> 41:07.060]  But I don't you know, all right, you'll see it on tv
[41:07.860 --> 41:12.760]  They're gonna pay money in between to put segments of a show in between commercials
[41:13.780 --> 41:17.700]  They're gonna pay to broadcast a 30-second short film
[41:19.940 --> 41:21.940]  About one of their products
[41:21.940 --> 41:27.140]  Uh, well if they're not going to do it then who is if you haven't seen it
[41:27.220 --> 41:32.260]  It's just 30 seconds of almost like stop motion animation almost
[41:32.340 --> 41:36.900]  It's just I don't know if they're a bunch but it's just a whole bunch of very very quick cuts
[41:37.620 --> 41:40.660]  Um, I think maybe less than a second each. Um
[41:42.100 --> 41:46.900]  Uh of macbook, I think mostly macbook airs, but then it's all mac. It's all macbook airs
[41:47.220 --> 41:49.220]  Oh, I thought at the end they switched to
[41:49.220 --> 41:52.260]  bigger really because I thought that the whole the whole
[41:52.660 --> 41:58.740]  Ad was about was about the air because okay, then it's a macbook. Everybody's favorite. Maybe it's two different sizes of macbook airs
[41:59.220 --> 42:04.260]  um, but with you know, all sorts of custom stickers decorating the
[42:04.900 --> 42:05.940]  the
[42:05.940 --> 42:10.340]  Outer apple logo case they never show the screen. It's always just the apple logo
[42:10.900 --> 42:12.020]  um
[42:12.020 --> 42:14.500]  Some of them i've seen before some of them pretty clever
[42:14.500 --> 42:22.340]  But then I noticed the one about halfway through it's it's like a a pixel art version of the old six color apple logo
[42:22.980 --> 42:29.060]  That you put over the apple logo on the macbook and then when that met when the apple logo lights up it lights up
[42:29.540 --> 42:30.420]  the
[42:30.420 --> 42:33.620]  Decal I saw that one at first and I thought oh cool
[42:33.620 --> 42:38.900]  I haven't seen you know, that's a neat way to sneak the old apple logo into an ad but then at the very end of the
[42:38.900 --> 42:40.020]  ad
[42:40.020 --> 42:45.620]  They very quickly cycle through different styles of the apple logo not on a macbook. Just the apple logo
[42:45.780 --> 42:51.060]  Including the old six color apple logo and I found that really interesting
[42:51.380 --> 42:54.500]  Yeah, I got some pushback. I wrote about it and I said something. What did I say?
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.700]  I said it pretty well, so I should probably just rip rip myself off
[43:00.420 --> 43:04.900]  I wrote people have been decorating their laptops with stickers and decals ever since they became
[43:04.900 --> 43:09.380]  Consumer products you didn't see many stickers on them when they cost five thousand dollars
[43:09.380 --> 43:13.940]  I think the first time I tried to buy a power book. It was six thousand dollars and I was like, wow, that isn't going to happen
[43:15.700 --> 43:22.420]  And I don't think we need to commission a demographic survey to state that younger people are more likely to do this than older people
[43:22.420 --> 43:26.260]  It's no coincidence that the spot is debuting in back to school season
[43:27.940 --> 43:30.740]  In the old days apple didn't have to worry about conformance
[43:30.740 --> 43:37.140]  Just owning a mac made you stand out from the crowd, but what happens now when everyone you know has a macbook and every macbook looks
[43:37.620 --> 43:40.020]  The same something like this commercial is what happens
[43:42.180 --> 43:47.780]  Some people push back on tour like everybody, you know as a macbook and it's like I'm you know, obviously you can
[43:48.180 --> 43:55.060]  Something like that doesn't literally mean everybody but I i'll bet it's the case at a lot of schools that there are you know
[43:55.060 --> 44:00.820]  Like, you know, whether it's high school or or college where it seems like everybody, you know as a macbook, right?
[44:01.380 --> 44:07.380]  I don't know. I've seen those pictures. You see those pictures of like lecture halls. Yeah. I mean that's been happening for years. Yeah
[44:07.940 --> 44:08.900]  before
[44:08.900 --> 44:14.660]  These market changes happened in the pc market where where pc started falling and apple and mac started rising
[44:15.220 --> 44:18.340]  yeah, and I think it's you know that among um,
[44:19.060 --> 44:22.980]  Like younger, you know teenagers and college students. It's even more of a
[44:22.980 --> 44:25.540]  Teenagers and college students. It's even more profound
[44:26.260 --> 44:29.620]  Um, so yeah take every word everyone with a grain of salt
[44:29.700 --> 44:34.100]  But if it seems like most of your friends all have macbooks all macbooks
[44:34.660 --> 44:38.500]  You know, especially from the back look exactly the same, you know the air the pro
[44:39.140 --> 44:43.300]  That they're all just aluminum with a white logo. I mean, I think it's a cool look but
[44:43.860 --> 44:46.100]  You know as a kid that's there's a sort of
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.160]  Resistance to that sort of
[44:50.320 --> 44:51.700]  conformance
[44:51.700 --> 44:54.100]  Yeah, i'm not a fan of the plastic
[44:54.740 --> 44:56.020]  covers
[44:56.020 --> 44:57.620]  What plastic covers every once in a while?
[44:57.620 --> 44:59.220]  I'll put a put a cover on my iphone
[44:59.220 --> 45:04.180]  But I just because I feel like i'm going to drop that but I don't on a macbook. I don't
[45:04.980 --> 45:06.980]  I don't like the plastic
[45:07.700 --> 45:10.820]  Yeah, and I don't think you need to protect it. Well, the other thing that shells shells
[45:10.980 --> 45:15.380]  Yeah, the other thing that's interesting about that commercial is it shows a bunch of them that are beaten up
[45:16.260 --> 45:18.260]  literally dented scratched
[45:18.340 --> 45:20.340]  right well used uh
[45:20.340 --> 45:25.640]  And that's pretty interesting because it's in my knowledge. I think matthew panzerino pointed this out. I don't think apple's ever advertised
[45:26.580 --> 45:29.620]  With you know, well-worn versions of their machines
[45:32.500 --> 45:38.980]  Um, but they've talked about it before like johnny i've at least has in those, you know those videos he shoots from the the
[45:40.180 --> 45:42.180]  Weird white universe he lives in
[45:44.180 --> 45:48.580]  You know, it's like where that guy who runs the matrix is yeah running the matrix sure
[45:48.580 --> 45:49.940]  You know that
[45:49.940 --> 45:55.220]  That they choose these materials for how they wear, you know, and that it should be like a pair of you know
[45:55.460 --> 46:00.420]  Good good old pair of boots or blue jeans or something like that, you know that it should look better as it ages
[46:00.900 --> 46:02.900]  But they don't show it like that
[46:03.140 --> 46:06.660]  But I do think there's a truth to it, you know, and I think that especially you know
[46:06.660 --> 46:09.940]  A phone is different because it's got glass and you know, that's the glass
[46:10.580 --> 46:14.500]  All things are off with that. I don't use a case for my phone, but I don't blame anybody who does because
[46:14.500 --> 46:18.980]  Glass, whereas, you know macbooks are in my experience extremely rugged
[46:19.940 --> 46:21.140]  Yeah
[46:21.140 --> 46:25.540]  Especially especially since they've switched to ssd's
[46:26.580 --> 46:28.020]  Yeah
[46:28.020 --> 46:32.340]  I think that you know and the aluminum, you know, I think that it's kind of neat. I think
[46:32.580 --> 46:37.540]  Johnny, i've probably liked that ad I think he'd like probably seeing seeing him beat up and worn in an ad
[46:38.420 --> 46:42.340]  Because I do think they designed for that. Yeah. Does your kid have a macbook?
[46:42.340 --> 46:49.300]  Uh, he uses a very old macbook air. Yeah. He's hank's got my old macbook pro and man. He's he's rough on that thing
[46:51.940 --> 46:54.500]  Like physically rough or like rough like
[46:55.300 --> 46:56.340]  everything
[46:56.340 --> 47:02.100]  I mean it's you know the and and and he sees like he spilled a drink on the keyboard and and now I gotta figure out
[47:02.100 --> 47:04.500]  How to get the keys off to clean because it's they're sticky now
[47:05.540 --> 47:07.540]  Like underneath they're sticky
[47:07.540 --> 47:10.500]  The clean, you know, it's easy to clean the keys off of the keyboard
[47:10.500 --> 47:14.260]  Sticky the clean, you know, it's easy to clean the top of them. But now they're like, yeah
[47:16.900 --> 47:18.900]  The touch that I would not type on that thing
[47:20.420 --> 47:22.100]  Uh
[47:22.100 --> 47:28.420]  Jonas has a bit of a passive aggressive streak to him where he's taken now to showing me some um
[47:29.280 --> 47:35.940]  Minecraft mods there's there's they're called shaders and they they totally change the way the game is rendered
[47:36.660 --> 47:37.940]  and uh
[47:37.940 --> 47:40.660]  and he says look this one is meant for uh
[47:41.380 --> 47:45.140]  Mac old macbook airs to make it look better and it's still laggy
[47:46.820 --> 47:50.660]  Wow, isn't that interesting and then you know and then he's like but this one's actually all right
[47:50.740 --> 47:53.140]  Even though it wasn't meant for an old macbook
[47:55.060 --> 47:58.980]  But this one's well and he goes well it's laggy but it's not as laggy
[48:00.660 --> 48:02.660]  And I do kind of feel bad but
[48:03.060 --> 48:04.660]  in the sense that
[48:04.660 --> 48:10.900]  Somehow i'm proud that he you know cares about frame rate and right right. No, I get that. I get that too, right?
[48:11.380 --> 48:16.180]  Like we have got a great running gag in our house where like because it's well, you're you guys are three two
[48:16.260 --> 48:18.260]  So it's there's never a tie
[48:18.580 --> 48:21.780]  somebody's always going to win and so like one of ours is
[48:21.780 --> 48:34.100]  Um standard def video on the tv. Amy doesn't really notice doesn't really seem to care jonas jonas acts as though he's been poisoned
[48:35.220 --> 48:38.340]  Like a spit take like you expect me to watch this
[48:39.780 --> 48:43.780]  I don't think kang notices the video quality that much maybe that's because he's not wearing his glasses
[48:44.900 --> 48:46.900]  but um, but he definitely like
[48:46.900 --> 48:51.860]  Frame rates or buffering drive him berserk. Oh, oh my god
[48:52.100 --> 48:55.380]  God help you if something is buffering on like netflix or something
[48:58.820 --> 49:04.340]  Or anything drops below 60 when we gotta move to another country where they have better 60 frames per second
[49:04.340 --> 49:07.060]  So when I was a kid, we had uh, eight pixels on the screen
[49:08.020 --> 49:10.020]  And a black and white tv
[49:10.020 --> 49:18.660]  Yeah, all right our atari 2600 literally had a switch you could flip that said you're playing on a black and white tv
[49:20.180 --> 49:22.420]  You remember that it was a switch it was like b and w
[49:23.140 --> 49:29.940]  And it was like I guess it somehow would you know, oh it only chooses shades. Oh, yeah, right, you know, right things that would make it
[49:31.540 --> 49:34.820]  My first video game console had a mode for black and white TVs
[49:34.820 --> 49:36.820]  So
[49:38.420 --> 49:40.260]  Anything else on the
[49:40.260 --> 49:41.860]  quarterly finances
[49:41.860 --> 49:46.740]  Uh, just that they are looking forward to having a big fall. Oh, is that what they said?
[49:46.820 --> 49:50.100]  I didn't see that see that we're recording at a time where I have not seen
[49:50.900 --> 49:52.900]  the the the
[49:53.780 --> 49:56.820]  The conference call which is usually where more information comes out
[49:56.820 --> 49:59.300]  So they've dropped a hint that they expect to have a big fall
[49:59.300 --> 50:05.700]  Yes. Oh and the other the other thing which you know, we've been hoping for and kind of expecting to
[50:06.660 --> 50:08.420]  and then the other thing I thought was interesting was that
[50:09.300 --> 50:16.820]  Tim cook said that the growth in the iphone 5c, you know, they don't give out they don't break out right how well each iphone does
[50:17.780 --> 50:25.140]  But he said the growth this quarter and the iphone 5c tier was higher than the growth in either the 4s or the 5s
[50:25.860 --> 50:27.860]  tier
[50:27.860 --> 50:29.700]  Hmm so
[50:29.700 --> 50:36.420]  All right. In other words not, you know, obviously there's no there was no previous 4c to compare against but it was that the pricing tiers
[50:37.700 --> 50:39.700]  Yes. Yeah, so it was it
[50:40.100 --> 50:45.060]  Compared to the 4s a year ago, I guess compared to the 4s a year ago. Correct, right? Yeah
[50:45.380 --> 50:46.580]  Yeah, I think that's interesting
[50:46.580 --> 50:52.740]  Especially since there are a lot of people who were sort of chalking the 5c up as a failure as somehow that it was that it was
[50:52.740 --> 50:58.340]  Right, that's the yeah, and and it's only you know, it's a in arguably a failure in that
[50:58.340 --> 51:01.860]  They I don't think they didn't sell as many as apple thought they were going to sell
[51:02.260 --> 51:07.540]  Or maybe they didn't sell them as many as they thought they would in the first quarter, but maybe yeah for the year as a whole
[51:08.100 --> 51:14.180]  Yeah, or I guess it's only been nine months or so, but and it's still like it's like the fourth or fifth best-selling phone
[51:14.740 --> 51:19.940]  I I see a lot of them. I really do i've started. Yeah, i've still you keep seeing more and more. Um
[51:19.940 --> 51:22.100]  Yeah, I think you know, I don't think apple
[51:23.060 --> 51:27.460]  I know from talking to some people at apple that they don't they don't they don't have a crystal ball
[51:27.460 --> 51:31.780]  They don't they didn't know exactly how many like talking to them last year when they first announced them
[51:32.100 --> 51:39.140]  And to me the part that stuck out right on day one was that I think it was at 199 or was it 299?
[51:39.140 --> 51:42.740]  There was one price where you could for the exact same price
[51:43.380 --> 51:48.420]  Carrier subsidized you could get either the 5s or the 5c you could get like the best 5c
[51:48.420 --> 51:55.300]  You could get like the best 5c or the worst 5s at I think okay. I don't know if it was 199 different
[51:55.460 --> 51:57.460]  Just different amounts of memory
[51:58.020 --> 51:59.540]  Or yes
[51:59.540 --> 52:07.780]  Yeah, I you know and did you know the 5s has yeah, it was like the 16 gigabyte 5s versus the 32 gigabyte
[52:08.180 --> 52:12.260]  5c doesn't matter I I could be wrong on that don't even email me but you know
[52:12.260 --> 52:20.100]  It's something like that. You get a 32 gigabyte 5c or 16 gigabyte 5s at the exact same price and I thought that was interesting because
[52:20.420 --> 52:21.700]  that's
[52:21.700 --> 52:24.740]  It's like for some people who someone is less informed
[52:25.220 --> 52:29.940]  You know, maybe that's a difficult decision and how did they think that was gonna break out and they're like, we don't know
[52:30.020 --> 52:35.380]  You know, we you know, we really don't know we have some estimates but you know until we put this stuff out
[52:35.540 --> 52:38.180]  You know, we're off. We're always a little surprised by with which
[52:39.380 --> 52:41.220]  You know exact
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.220]  configuration sell better than others
[52:43.860 --> 52:47.540]  You know, there's some consistency year over year, but sometimes, you know, you can't predict it
[52:47.860 --> 52:51.780]  So I think they're probably a little surprised that the 5c didn't sell
[52:52.980 --> 52:58.020]  Great right off the bat and maybe they're a little surprised that it has legs as strong as it does
[52:58.020 --> 53:00.020]  But I think you know, there's a there's an easy
[53:01.040 --> 53:04.660]  Explanation, you know that it it the one that people who are
[53:04.660 --> 53:10.600]  Enthusiasts are gonna buy is always going to be the the top of the line brand. Yeah a real new one, right?
[53:10.680 --> 53:15.320]  That you care about things like that. The camera is a little better has, you know an extra half stop
[53:16.040 --> 53:22.200]  Of exposure and you care about the fact that the a7 is a faster, you know, CPU
[53:22.440 --> 53:26.120]  I mean every day my life is better every day because my phone runs 64-bit
[53:27.080 --> 53:30.680]  I can't believe there's people out there running in 32 32-bit cell phone
[53:30.680 --> 53:32.680]  If
[53:32.840 --> 53:38.180]  I had a 32-bit cell phone. I probably couldn't read my phone with either eye. I just kill myself. That's right
[53:38.180 --> 53:40.180]  Yeah, that's what I would do
[53:41.240 --> 53:42.160]  But no, you know
[53:42.160 --> 53:47.720]  I mean we think about things like that and then we do stupid things like go get in line on day one to buy
[53:47.720 --> 53:50.600]  One so that we can have it the first day that it comes out
[53:51.240 --> 53:53.400]  Whereas people who are not like that
[53:53.960 --> 54:00.320]  Like just buy a phone whenever their old one breaks or whenever they feel like their old one man. I'm sick of this old phone
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.040]  I got to get a new phone and then they go in and they're like, wow, I like that pink one. That looks cool
[54:06.280 --> 54:11.240]  I'm gonna get that one and they don't care about the fact that the you know cameras one year old
[54:11.480 --> 54:12.000]  Yeah
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.600]  and so of course it makes sense that that's the one that I think in hindsight it not now is
[54:16.920 --> 54:19.480]  Make sense that that's the one that would
[54:20.280 --> 54:23.320]  Do better year over year more like us more of a slow burn
[54:24.560 --> 54:26.280]  Right and it still looks new
[54:26.280 --> 54:32.320]  it looks like a new phone whereas like a year ago if you were gonna buy the mid-tier phone you were getting the 4s and
[54:32.320 --> 54:34.320]  it kind of looked a little older and
[54:34.360 --> 54:39.040]  You know just you know, kind of looked like a year old phone compared to the 5s
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.080]  Whereas the 5c looks just as new just you know a different style
[54:44.940 --> 54:49.380]  There was another there was a rumor about did you see this? I can't was at the Wall Street Journal
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.760]  That Apple was ordering
[54:52.760 --> 54:55.760]  60 to 80 million
[54:56.760 --> 55:01.540]  Big phones. Oh, I saw something about this right some huge number of
[55:02.160 --> 55:08.080]  Right, whereas like the ones for the you know, like I think like last year in the fall. They sold like 50 million and
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.180]  So like something like 80 is like a huge spike. Yeah
[55:12.180 --> 55:18.460]  I saw some stuff on Twitter about that where it's like one rogue report that they're ordering 80 million. Yeah iPhones
[55:18.460 --> 55:25.660]  Now means that you know six months from now and they've report the holiday quarter. It's full sell 75. It's
[55:26.380 --> 55:29.760]  Yeah, anything less than that is gonna be a huge mess
[55:30.580 --> 55:33.780]  No matter how much higher it is than what it actually was a year ago
[55:35.020 --> 55:39.020]  Let's well a hold that thought let's I'm gonna do a sponsor read and I want to hold that thought on
[55:39.740 --> 55:41.220]  bigger iPhones

[57:19.200 --> 57:25.480]  Really high quality and great teachers the type of people who you want to be learning from real pros
[57:25.480 --> 57:28.400]  Not just some idiot with a webcam real pros
[57:29.500 --> 57:35.720]  Great production values and new stuff coming out all the time. It's amazes me whenever I check in and see what they've got
[57:35.720 --> 57:42.920]  Just how everything like new versions of the Adobe CS suite come out and new lynda.com
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.880]  Courses on them come out immediately. It's amazing
[57:49.880 --> 57:55.600]  Can't emphasize enough just how great the quality is and and the deal it sounds too good to be true you go there

[58:29.560 --> 58:31.400]  My thanks to them
[58:31.400 --> 58:33.880]  All right, big iPhone. I
[58:35.480 --> 58:38.400]  Might be a week or two behind but on ATP
[58:39.040 --> 58:43.280]  Syracuse a brought up I thought a great question and I was like, how come nobody's talking about this?
[58:43.360 --> 58:50.240]  They're talking about you know, this there's this pervasive rumors that there's gonna be too big our iPhones 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch
[58:51.960 --> 58:54.960]  How come if there's going to be a 5.5 inch iPhone
[58:54.960 --> 59:03.040]  That wire where are the component leaks because there's all sorts of component leaks purported at least for the
[59:03.360 --> 59:06.220]  4.7 and they're from people who've had
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.940]  Like a year ago when they had component leaks of things like the gold back of the 5s
[59:13.940 --> 59:15.940]  You know, we're pretty much spot-on
[59:16.960 --> 59:22.760]  But there's no and there's so, you know the for the 4.7 inch new iPhone
[59:22.760 --> 59:26.600]  Is seems to be tracking exactly on pace?
[59:27.680 --> 59:30.880]  Leakwise as the last two or three years of iPhones
[59:31.360 --> 59:37.920]  Which to me it makes it seem like a slam-dunk like unless something you know goes wrong or you know
[59:38.440 --> 59:41.500]  It seems like that's that's going to be a new product soon
[59:42.220 --> 59:44.080]  But there's nothing I haven't seen anything
[59:44.080 --> 59:49.720]  There's you know, like there have been screens that have come out for the 4.7. There have been cases nothing for the 5.5
[59:49.720 --> 59:54.040]  And then like Reuters had a story last week. I think it was Reuters. Maybe it was business week
[59:54.040 --> 59:56.400]  but one of them had a story that said that
[59:57.440 --> 59:58.980]  that the
[59:58.980 --> 01:00:04.160]  4.7 inch iPhone 6 is going into production now like meaning July and that the
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.920]  5.5 inch one is going into production next month meaning August
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.640]  but she's you might think well if it's a month behind then
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.680]  You know, maybe the leaks are gonna start coming soon
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:23.420]  But the leaks for the 4.7 inch phone came more than a month ago started a long time, right? They started months plural ago
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.540]  I mean, of course, it makes sense that they would pick up if it is, you know entering production, but I
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.680]  Don't know there's something about this 5.5 inch thing that to me is starting to sound like it isn't gonna happen
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.920]  And it seems kind of crazy to think that they would have phone phones in three sizes. I don't know it just
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  that seems to
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  Just I've said it before on numerous much it just seems like it's it's and to introduce to at the same time seems very
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.920]  Odd, yeah, it seems like it would make Phil Schiller's head explode like from a product marketing perspective. How do you frame it?
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.920]  you know, how do you frame the story like
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.200]  it
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:09.280]  Like with the iPads, they've got the same specs same camera same, you know CPU same pixel dimensions
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.000]  it's just you want one bigger or smaller and you have to pay, you know extra hundred bucks or 129 bucks or whatever the
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.520]  difference is for the bigger one and it somehow seems to make sense in consumer minds that you pay a little more to get a
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.240]  Bigger one pay a little less to get a smaller one or maybe it doesn't maybe that's why iPad sales are down
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.760]  I don't know, but but it somehow comes across as feeling fair
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.000]  Whereas if they come out with two new iPhone sixes and they're like the same a8
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.220]  a system on a chip the same new and improved camera the same thinness and
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:47.460]  One cost more than the other. Well, which one cost more? I'd rather have the smaller one. So would I right?
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.260]  It doesn't seem to me like you should pay more for a bigger one
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.460]  So I don't it doesn't make any sense to me, but maybe up maybe we're in luck
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:02:00.120]  Maybe this will be the year where I don't want to buy the most expensive. I mean it particularly because they've approached this so
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.900]  Slowly and carefully to date. Yeah jumping up to 5.5 inches seems
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.860]  Unnecessary and they're still they're still growing sales. I mean, it's not like it, you know, you know
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:17.820]  If it was the iPad maybe then we might think okay. Well sales are falling. Maybe they need to do something
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:23.860]  Else, but you know, it's not like it's not like they have a big problem selling iPhones
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:28.700]  Yeah, please these four-inch iPhones are only selling in record numbers
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.940]  And conversely, I don't think it makes any sense product marketing wise
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:41.300]  for if there's two for one to be like an a tier and one to be the B tier because there's some number of people who
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.060]  are going to
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.500]  Want the other one but want the other specs, right?
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.660]  somebody is going to say I want a top-of-the-line iPhone and if the top-of-the-line one is
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.460]  the
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:59.980]  5.5 inch and the mid tier one is 4.7 inch like the 5c equivalent class spec wise
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.260]  Well, I'm gonna be upset because I don't want a 5.5 inch iPhone
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.980]  Even though I'm spent half an hour being a show talking about how I can't read
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:17.420]  I don't want it. I don't I'd rather not be able to read my phone then carry something that big I
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.900]  Don't get it. I don't see how they could do it, you know
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:26.420]  And then if you know, like let's say that the 5.5 inch one has a better camera than a 4.7 inch one
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.420]  Well that I mean that's gonna make me angry
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:36.520]  Right. I just don't see it. It doesn't make any never made any sense to me like the iPhone. I don't know. I'll
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.480]  wait and then and then do they still they sell for phones or do they sell or does the
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:49.880]  Yes, this doesn't make any sense if they switch to a thing where the new iPhone 6 is out
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.800]  And it has now it has a 4.7 inch screen. I
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.320]  Don't that doesn't sound good to me
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.680]  I like four inches, but I'll try it and it does sound reasonable and it just maybe you know as batteries get bigger
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.280]  You know, you know, maybe I'll be happy with it. I don't think you know what? I kind of like having a bigger phone and
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.520]  You know
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520]  You know, like I said, my eyes are getting worse
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:17.000]  Maybe maybe I mean and when they get when the five came out, it was physically smaller than the 4s, right?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.520]  It is a larger screen, but in terms of volume, it was actually a smaller phone, right?
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.160]  And so I would hope they would do something like that again. Yeah, it felt like a fair trade-off
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.880]  Yeah, whereas going to 5.5 is just ridiculous
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.280]  Although I'm not saying no that I can't believe that other people would want a device like that
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.160]  I do I totally understand that some people love them and
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.320]  That they you know that there is like it's like a sweet spot between you know
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.680]  I don't need a tablet and a phone. I just have this one device. It's this I know it's not for me
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.520]  I've seen such similar devices. I can't imagine carrying them around carrying it around in my pocket everywhere I go
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280]  So I just don't see it. I
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.160]  Also don't I do think that also though and and with the discussions no, you know joking aside about
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080]  You know my presbyopia
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:08.120]  It does raise the question though of what is the point of getting a bigger screen?
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.760]  Is it to make everything bigger so that you see the same amount of text, but now it's bigger
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.640]  Or is it to put more on the screen and keep the text the same size?
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.680]  And now that you can have more text at the same time
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:29.080]  Yeah, I think the answer is maybe both a little bit of both right with the settings, you know liked with the
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:35.160]  What do they call it? Oh, so you could have one of the other they don't call it adaptive text
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.120]  But there's you know with iOS 7 they introduced the thing where you go into general
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:46.080]  Text size and you can make text bigger system-wide and maybe you know
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.320]  It always seems to me like when you make it bigger on
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.320]  The current iPhone it just takes up too much space maybe with a 5.5 inch phone
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.680]  that it would be a great option for people with
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.160]  a
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.120]  Failing eyesight that I could see that as a great product
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.320]  But I just I still don't see how they sell it alongside the 4.7 inch
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.880]  at least at the same year
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.000]  It just seems like a lot to sell yeah, I don't know that to me I'm
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.680]  Leaks, even though there are leaks coming out
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:21.320]  I feel like we know less about what they're going to announce iPhone wise then in years many years
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.320]  I can't even remember the last time that we that I've had so much
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.320]  Yeah, because last year about this time we had oh, oh, well, I don't know if was quite this time
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  certainly by August we had seen
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.640]  the
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.860]  5c I had already written my review
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.840]  No, no, we didn't see the 5c did we know but I thought we saw the shells
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.400]  Oh, I thought we only saw the 5s the the metal ones. I didn't think we saw the plastic ones
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  Oh, no, maybe we did neighbor. Why did me? Yeah, I think they were white
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.640]  Yeah, but we didn't see all the colors. I don't think I think we just saw like a white plastic one. Yeah
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.640]  Yeah, I do remember something like that. So we're we're in agreement. Well, I thought 5.5
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:08.320]  Yet anyway, I don't know and then there's people in the people saying the rumors saying that it's a month behind
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.740]  Or that it might come early next year. I
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.240]  Why they wouldn't announce that in September then that seems weird that they would do that
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.920]  Like if it's three or four months behind that seems to me like that's a non-starter like it should either be
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.800]  at the same time and
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.220]  Therefore in time for the holidays or like six months later
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.320]  You could you know, maybe do it in April or something like that. Like when they
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.840]  announced the first couple of events. Yeah
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.640]  But if you know the holidays, it's such a weird blip on their quarter
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.460]  I mean you can see it every time they have these, you know, like today every time they do the quarterly finance announcements
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.700]  It's such a weird blip. There's such a holiday heavily
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:56.680]  Company that it just doesn't make sense that they would have something that would debut and I don't know January or something like that
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:02.400]  And they can't announce it in September because then people would you know, it's the whole Osborne effect thing
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.700]  Like they're not gonna want to buy the 4.7 inch one
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.040]  Until they can see the 5.5 inch one and make a side-by-side comparison
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Or you know, they can't just have five point, you know, we're not gonna sell it until January
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  But we'll put them in the stores so you can see them. Well, then if people love them that you know
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.120]  What they're gonna did they wait that doesn't make any sense, you know, you don't show people something unless you can sell it to them
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.200]  Yeah, I just don't get it. Something just doesn't doesn't some of those rumors came from
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.720]  Ming Chi cool. I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.680]  who is held up as like
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.880]  one of the really good
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.480]  rumor, you know rumor sources and
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.440]  and
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.080]  used to work for digitimes and now works now works for KGI securities
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.760]  Everybody I don't even know if it's a he or she but it's a he
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.280]  All right, if he got he got fired from digitized for track record
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.680]  And he's and he's been you know, he's gotten a number of things, correct
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:07.560]  but he's also gotten a number of things completely incorrect because last year he said that the iPhones was going to be announced at
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:14.920]  WW DC right and and he's the one saying that oh the the iPhones delayed, you know
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920]  the big iPhones are delayed and
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.240]  Won't because won't be coming it might not come until next year
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.560]  I think that if the 5.5 inch iPhone is quota is delayed. Maybe they were working on it
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.560]  Maybe it is delayed for whatever reason
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.320]  That means it's pushed back a year. That's what I think
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.440]  Yeah, I would I would think so too, right? They are not going to do something like the read two three months after the initial one
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.080]  So here's the thing. Here's what I can't wait for then. Imagine this scenario September comes
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:48.080]  There's a big iPhone event that your Buena Center is rented out. They put up some kind of big colorful poster
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.760]  I fly out there where they have a big showing dog and show dog and pony show
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.200]  and the only new iPhone they announce is
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.080]  A 4.7 inch iPhone 6. It doesn't matter how awesome that phone is
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.480]  How many people are gonna say where's my 5.5 inch iPhone?
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.160]  Right, I mean that's it's like the can't win situation that Apple is in like
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.120]  It if they I I don't see how they could do this
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.840]  I still doesn't make sense to me how they would do both but if they don't do both there's gonna be some number of people
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.280]  Who are outraged?
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.960]  And are gonna say that they are out of touch. They're you know
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.960]  Gonna disappear in 60 days if they don't get a 5.5 inch phone out
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.800]  Did they did they disappear after that that 60 days I wanted to know someone would ask on the conference call
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.600]  I'm guessing I guess he tripped Chaudhary does not get on the conference call
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.800]  Trip Chaudhary does not get on the conference call. It would be great
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.800]  If he's not get to answer to ask questions on the conference. Can we kickstarter that I
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.960]  I would totally kickstarter a project to get trip Chaudhary onto the uh,
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.960]  Every conference call, you know at least for the next four, you know, we'll pay whatever it costs
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.800]  And we'll get trip Chaudhary on every he gets one question on every call
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:22.240]  He can just take gene Munster's spot right because Munster's just gonna ask about apple tv he's gonna ask you guys
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.400]  You know, he's gonna burn a question on the apple tv. Yeah
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.960]  Let's give one to trip Chaudhary
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.280]  Tim chip Chaudhary here. Are you still in business? Are you still in business? I've got you penciled in for
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.840]  Disappearing in early June when you didn't release an iwatch thing
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.280]  That guy this is Tim
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560]  I don't do him for the first time
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.680]  I don't do impressions. This is my this is my Tim Cook southern accent. I'm gonna take that question
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.640]  Uh, no, we're still here
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.080]  Talk to you next quarter. Yeah, I don't know check in in 90 days
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  Hopefully, yeah
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.560]  If we can keep the lights on the uh, the other one other thing from the
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.800]  one other thing from the uh that I
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.960]  Heard on the little bit of the conference call that I heard before we got on the air
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.400]  Was that well the ipad sales were down
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.640]  Overall, they were up about 50 percent in
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.280]  countries like china and india
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.640]  yeah, which was interesting and they were down in the
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.960]  the
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:44.080]  mature countries or developed nations, whatever they call them brick countries br ic now, what what is that brazil
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.720]  Russia india china, what's the oh, yeah brazil russia india china
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.080]  brazil russia india china sounds it sounds like
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:59.380]  Like four random countries which is yeah, although they're except that they're both all four are enormously
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.140]  Populous. Mm-hmm, right?
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  Right
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.640]  Um, yeah, so those those four countries it's way up and isn't that exactly the the
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.320]  Those are exactly the sort of countries where I feel like everybody said they would would never
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.040]  Never sell any ipads
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.160]  uh
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:27.840]  Well, and that they also are like the sort of countries where everybody was saying last year when the 5c came out and wasn't cheap
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.920]  Mm-hmm, you know that everybody's saying oh they're gonna make a cheap iphone and they came out and it wasn't it was you know
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.800]  They had nothing to do with the cost it had to do with
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:44.720]  Having the mid-tier occupied by a new device at the same price point instead of a year-old device coming down
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.280]  That's all they did. It had nothing to do with the price
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:48.960]  um
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.320]  it was about replacing the middle tier with a new phone rather than
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.000]  um
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.760]  And one that was probably cheaper to build. Yeah, I think so helped helped helped their margin, right?
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.080]  I think because yeah, I think that there's something
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.640]  Yeah, there's something to that where I think that the the the refined aluminum if you know if they had held the past
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:15.600]  Pattern instead of the 5c the 5c wouldn't exist and the the iphone 5 would still be sold at that point
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080]  Which is what the 5c is
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080]  internally
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.800]  Which also I guess if we want to speculate about iphones I I do you think there's gonna be an iphone 5cs
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.160]  5cs which would be an iphone 5s in a plastic case. No, I would
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.560]  hmm, I can't I don't know if they're gonna call it a 5cs because it's starting to get like a
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:43.840]  Mouthful to me the simplest thing is the the 5c drops down the 5s drops down and you get a 4.7 inch
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.040]  Yeah, but I kind of feel like the pattern they set last year is they don't want to sell the nice
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.360]  metal
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.320]  Case or you know exterior in the middle in the middle?
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.520]  I
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.840]  Do feel uh, I feel like I feel like that year was a setup just to get to the point where the plastic case
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.800]  Is on the bottom level? Yeah, maybe it could be it's either one or the other. That's a good that's a good point
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.960]  It could be about that. They needed to get it out one year in advance before it. Yeah, it's down
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.480]  Could be could be
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.120]  I don't know though. I'm not so sure about I don't know. I don't know either. I think it's sort of about
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:28.160]  See my my guess is that it's sort of about setting your expectations for which one will cost more before you even turn them on
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.560]  That you can look at a 5c and a 5s side-by-side while the screens are off
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.400]  And I think most people would be able to guess which one's more expensive than the other
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.480]  whereas
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.680]  my
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680]  5s the current 5s
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.200]  Pick your favorite color versus the iphone 6 this 4.7 inch iphone 6
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.080]  I don't know that you'd be able to do that
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.200]  Right if you you know, if you just purely like bigger devices, I guess you'd think this one's nicer
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.160]  But you know if you like smaller devices, you might think
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:08.160]  That the 5s is whereas if they put the 5s internals into a 5c style plastic case then it it sets that up
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.200]  I don't know. That's a good qua that's one of the things i'll be looking at
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.600]  I don't know. That's a good qua. I I that's one of the things i'll be looking forward to next month or september
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.840]  I guess right the brick countries
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.640]  Uh, no, I I think that everybody said last year that that they need to sell a cheap
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.280]  Iphone for china because people in china per capita don't have a lot of money
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.640]  Um, what do they call them emerging markets? Is that the term emerging markets, right?
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.440]  And I think I don't think apple thinks there are such things as emerging markets. I really don't I think the way they approach it
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:46.320]  Is that there's people who can afford iphones and people who can't you know, and I know I don't mean it to
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.640]  To be flippant, you know, but the fact that the average person in china
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.160]  Maybe can't afford a iphone 5c or probably can't afford an iphone c let's face
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:02.080]  it doesn't mean that there aren't millions and millions of people in china who can because there's
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.720]  You know billions of people in china
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.840]  the other thing they did in the spring was add
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.480]  An eight gigabyte iphone 5c. Yeah
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.200]  That's a little weird. I kind of
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.400]  Wonder if that had anything to you know, if that had much to do with it boy
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.640]  I just can't believe I can't believe that the difference from apple's perspective between eight and 16 gigabytes is
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120]  So is enough to warrant that
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.920]  It just seems miserly
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.000]  Yeah to give eight. Yeah
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.680]  Because it's you know and and you know and put a camera in it that can shoot high-def video and stuff
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:42.720]  It's like wow, that's it just seems miserly. I mean, I was looking I was looking at amazon had a sale on kindle fire
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.760]  last week and I was looking at them and
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.320]  it's like the price difference between the
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.560]  I think there was an eight gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte and the price difference between the two was like twenty dollars
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.880]  And even then you got to figure that's just just be you know, the cost difference can't I bet it's less than 20 bucks
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.160]  But that yeah, you can't how can you price them five dollars apart or whatever? Yeah
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.800]  You know, and I know ram is the same way and that's another
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.400]  John, syracuse a frequent complaint that apple always short changes the devices on ram, you know that the five
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.600]  I think we still only I don't know whatever we have we all wish we had more
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.240]  I think we only have one gigabyte of ram and the current I think that's that sounds right. Um
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.960]  And
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.880]  It that it it comes back to bite apple in the long run at the tail end like when somebody was
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:40.640]  Full-end like when somebody with a 4s upgrades to ios 7 and it feels like their phone is running slower
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:47.760]  Like the number one thing apple could do that would make that better. I you know, he thinks and I I agree would be if
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.080]  if they had
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.640]  Doubled the ram all along like if every single iphone had shipped maybe
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.840]  Excuse the first generation one because you know, it was a crazy. I can't believe they built this thing
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.280]  But if like the last few years of iphones had had more like if they had
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.720]  gone to a gigabyte in the years when they had 512 megabytes and if these ones now that have a gigabyte had two gigabytes
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.400]  It would I think it would give them a lot more headroom
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.560]  Down the road for like the last supported ios update they're going to give yeah
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.360]  Because it's sort of a no-win situation for them where if they cut them off earlier everybody like wow
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.160]  I just bought this phone two years ago and I already don't get the software update
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.920]  but then they get the software update and if it makes their phone feel slower because they don't have enough ram because it's optimized for the
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.640]  the brand new you know
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.160]  The you know, the first priority is to make it awesome on the top of the line iphone, which has more ram
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.960]  Then they get they get bitten
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:51.200]  I know you you get a limited edition limited edition like 256 gigabyte iphone
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.640]  But my wife and I both have the 16
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.960]  And we've been eking by on 16. So when I first when I got the first iphone, we both had four gigabyte iphones
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.880]  We were you know speaking of limited editions. Yeah
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.400]  That was a real limited limited edition phone and and I used that for two years
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.120]  And towards the end it got really painful
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.240]  And i'm at the same place now with 16 gigabytes and I was just like I can't
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.120]  I can't do it anymore and I don't know
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.720]  I just it seems it seems like at some point they I mean they got to jump up
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.520]  I could I could I think I own is 32. I could definitely get by with 32
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.560]  Uh, i'd have to I don't think I am right now. I think if I if I check I think my it's it's somewhere in the 40s
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.560]  My iphone is filled up to somewhere around 40 gigs. So i'm using
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.680]  Upwards, you know towards the 64, but I could there's a whole bunch of crap. I could delete I think yeah
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:53.200]  Well, that's how and that's I had a 32 gig 3gs and it was just like you know, I never can never even came close
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.320]  Particularly during that time period and I felt like I was you know
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.280]  I was like loading it up with movies and stuff and I was never watching them and I thought well
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.480]  Why am I why am I doing this? So I kept getting 16
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.680]  Gig phones after that and and now I finally got to the point where like, okay now I can't even get stuff on there
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.040]  You know have this all the stuff that I want that I really need on there
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.520]  I will I will point out before I take a final break for our third sponsor. I will point out
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:23.120]  The the obvious tension between the fact that half an hour ago. We were singing praises of apple's 39 profit margins
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.160]  Right, and now we're telling them that they should double they should double the ramens and flash storage
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.200]  In every single model across the board
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.920]  You know somewhere at apple there's somebody who's listening podcasting
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.440]  Somebody is listening podcasting some somebody is sitting there listening and smiling and saying yes
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.480]  You cannot have it both ways
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.640]  Um, yeah podcasting makes it easy. Just give everybody double the ram
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.240]  Double the ram. It's only it's 50 million phones
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.400]  um, you know, that's you know, there's a there is
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.760]  There is a secret to 39% profit margin, right? Sure, right, right
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:10.320]  and I but I feel like like i'm looking at a new like my wife's getting close to needing a new macbook and i'm
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  Gonna be there probably next year and
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.320]  And I just can't sanction getting a four gigabyte
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:23.360]  Four gigabytes of memory anymore. Oh, no and 128 gig drive. No, I think I I don't know
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:28.640]  I yeah, I think it's got to be more than that. Well for me. It's like I gotta go eight 256 and
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.280]  Boy, I you know, I don't know. It's like modern web pages are just like when you look in
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:41.120]  Activity monitor and you see how each tab now it gets to show you how much ram it's using. It's like right. It's crazy
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.720]  I you know not crazy, but you need more than four gigabytes and it just seems it again
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.600]  We're getting old four gigabytes of ram sounds like it still sounds to me magical
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.280]  It's that because it's the magical barrier where you need
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:02.240]  64-bit processing for one process to address that much space and I knew about that limit but like, you know
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.080]  In the 90s or even the 2000s it just seemed like some beautiful shangri-la of the future
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.760]  When you would have that much ram, you know, sure. Meanwhile, i'm i'm paying for eight megabyte
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.560]  memory chips with my last dollar
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.080]  To load up an old
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.280]  Mac lc with with 16 megabytes of ram
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:30.240]  Uh, and it just seems crazy that now we're saying I cannot get by with four gigabytes of ram, but you know
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.760]  That's how it goes like this
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.600]  Right some side some point I guess we'll be talking about terabytes of ram
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.800]  of that our kids
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:46.240]  Well, I will say this one last point though about it though, is that yes, that's obviously there's some tension there between the profit margins
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240]  and you know
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.360]  Doubling the ram and flash storage and every single device but on the other hand we do know that
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:59.460]  tim cook in particular and apple as an institution is very very fanatical about customer satisfaction
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.360]  and
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:09.120]  Again, i'm just ripping john syracuse off here, but but customer satisfaction is definitely tied to the amount of ram in your device
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.660]  especially
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:12.660]  Uh one or two years down the road
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:17.620]  So, you know, it's it's a multi. It's like one of those three-way tugs of war
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:25.220]  Like if there's one thing that maybe they would be willing to sacrifice a bit of long-term profit margin just a bit
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.860]  a bit of long-term profit margin for
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:34.040]  customer satisfaction seems like the type of trade-off that they would they would see as worth it because customer satisfaction
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.740]  Is a long-term investment
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.740]  I think right
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.740]  All right. Anyway, so
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:44.580]  Okay, right. All right. Anyway, I want to tell you about a brand new sponsor
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.420]  Um new kids on the block are called square space
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:58.740]  Uh square space can you spell that s q it's with a y okay, um, actually according to this they've been around for a while
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.900]  hmm, um
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.020]  hmm
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:07.400]  Uh seems like something I would have heard of but anyway, it sounds awesome. It's very strange. It is an all-in-one platform
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:13.660]  That makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website per for portfolio
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.640]  and or
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.280]  online store online store alone
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.080]  Makes it worth it. Anybody who's ever tried to make
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  uh
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.080]  I was going to put a curse word in there, but I probably shouldn't in a sponsor read but
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.680]  Online store

[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.640]  Do it that way. They have 24 7 support. This is a key key feature
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.320]  I think probably the key feature of squarespace is the great tech support

[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:54.360]  Uh, what were we talking about, uh, something about ipads iphones. Oh, uh, jamming more ramen for free. Yeah jamming more ramen for free
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:03.480]  But it's got to go up sometime and I feel like we're close to an inflection. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.280]  And you can you really can take use of it. I mean, I you know, I hate to say it but the you know
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  Devices still are everything is always
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  You know devices still are everything is always ram starved at this level. Oh, yeah
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.800]  you know and you know
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.560]  You don't see it as much as you used to but like you
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.280]  Switch from one app to another and then do another and then you go back to safari and your tabs have to reload
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.600]  Because safari had to give up its ram
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:34.280]  And flushed all the tabs and just remembers the urls and now you know, but you're in the supermarket and you're you get crummy
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.360]  cellular reception in the dairy aisle and now your tab doesn't reload faster, you know, it happens, you know,
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.460]  Whereas if you had double the ram your tab would still be there because you loaded it before you went to the supermarket
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:52.040]  I do a lot of my reading in the supermarket. Is there something they do in building a supermarket that shields?
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.600]  Um, like cellular connections
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.400]  I don't know because it seems like every time I go in the supermarket I get I get a worse connection than almost anywhere else
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.960]  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's those shelves that they use or something like the milk. Yeah
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.680]  all the liquids
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.120]  Yeah
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.120]  absorb absorbing the
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  signal
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.480]  Not a scientist
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400]  You're not a doctor and I'm not a scientist
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.120]  You know, there's something I wanted a customer satisfaction thing. I wanted to talk about. Oh, yeah
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.320]  I mean and he mentions that and I don't know if he said customer sat again this time. Yeah, but
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.000]  he
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.160]  They beat that drum throughout that conference call every single quarter. Yeah
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.320]  Well, I should yeah, and I think that they see it as a way of of
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:49.960]  Trying to prove scientifically, you know, however much a customer satisfaction survey can be held up as science
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.400]  But it's certainly better than just empty words, you know that
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:30:00.360]  People like apple products on average better than other people like competing products from other companies
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.160]  Right, which is a long-term advantage
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.720]  It's it's not it's a way of saying we're not in a commodity
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.800]  You know some a big portion of these markets that were in laptop computers
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.280]  tablets
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.600]  Cell phones is a commoditized market
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:25.900]  But where we're operating is not a commoditized market and that there's a sizable demand for the non commoditized
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.760]  You know products at the high end of these markets
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.520]  Do you see do you have a lot of people who are people you see with kindle fires?
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.640]  No, I don't see many kindle fires. I don't that might be a seattle area thing
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.400]  Yeah, and I wonder I always wonder if it's just it's more the area that I live in but I see and I also see just
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.400]  Like a lot of people buying them
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.040]  Uh as cheap tablets for their kids
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.520]  Like they think I think they some some people think well
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.440]  they think that I should get the cheapest one because it's just for the kid and then they also think that
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.720]  He's probably just going to drop it and yeah, I don't want him dropping an ipad. Yeah, that's interesting
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:09.160]  I wonder how the decline in year over year ipad sales already
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.120]  I mean already I mean like in the life of the product
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.120]  I I
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.120]  I think part of it is that people when they get a tablet if they if they keep using it
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:24.440]  They use it a lot longer than they use a cell phone and it's more like laptop in terms of replacement cycle
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  yeah, I guess so and
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.760]  and
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.400]  B maybe you know that it's
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.640]  This is a case where the ipad has become too expensive
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:40.200]  You know that maybe I don't know how many of these I don't know who else is selling a lot of tablets
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:45.000]  But you know if if people are buying them like you said like for kids and stuff like that
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:50.280]  That's it. You know, it's a great reason to buy a 250 device instead of a 500 device
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.360]  If you're giving it to a kid who you know, I mean, you know, look at the way
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920]  Things like a ds are constructed
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.080]  Right the the game boys, you know, they're they're made
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:05.560]  To be handled by children in ways that ipads are not
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.840]  And I don't you know, I don't think ipads are particularly fragile for tablets, but they do have a glass screen and they're not
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.240]  They don't look rugged
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:18.920]  Right. So they're just more expensive more expensive to replace right and it's not like ipad sales have collapsed
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.080]  It's just a drop but you know
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.760]  It just seems worrisome at a time when I think most of us thought that they'd still be going up
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.560]  Just because more and more people would be buying their first tablet
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.560]  Yeah
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.000]  It's hard. I mean, I you know, I always want to I always want a new one. So
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.720]  I find it. I find it odd that not everybody else does but
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520]  Here's an interesting customer satisfaction
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.160]  angle and and it's like a long-term thing is that it's
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:51.640]  A belief and I I think this applies at a consumer level and at an enterprise level like in time
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.040]  I don't want to spend a lot of time on that ibm thing but um
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.280]  that
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:02.440]  Apple has long had the knock against it that they charge per too high of prices and that they you know
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:07.080]  They're greedy and that they make these obscene profits and they charge too much for everything
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.800]  And that their stuff is just too expensive right and and some you know
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.200]  There were some times in the late 90s early 2000s where like, you know pound for pound
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:23.560]  Maybe the mac was more, you know, a comparable mac was more expensive than comparable pieces of paper
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:30.120]  A comparable mac was more expensive than comparable pc, but especially in the intel mac era, you know
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:34.840]  That's that's you know long ago been turned around where like there's been a lot of times where you know to come
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:39.800]  To to get the same spec. I remember when the mac pros came out last year the new ones
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.520]  Um, I guess that was earlier this year. Um
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.960]  You know people tried to configure the same type of thing from dell
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.740]  And it wasn't going to come in a cool case like the mac pro and it was way more expensive
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:54.780]  right and and laptops too like sure apple's starting laptop price is
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:00.700]  899 and you know, there's a lot of companies that sell, you know, 299 399 pc laptops
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:05.900]  But to get the same specs it actually would cost more and you'd get a lesser build quality
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.700]  Not really fair
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:12.140]  But people have that belief and I think that when they see little things
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:18.380]  They they're viewed through that prism. And here's an example. I was at a family thing a couple weeks ago
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.740]  and
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.020]  somebody
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:25.020]  It was you know, I outdoors everybody's barbecue and we're drinking beer, you know
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:31.820]  And somebody had mentioned and it wasn't in the context of hey, I know you you you write about apple
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:37.580]  It was just people were talking about iphones and it had nothing to do with me being present. I was just a fly on the wall
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:45.020]  Wasn't you know complain to me about it, but it was somebody a woman who was complaining because
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:48.060]  She still had an iphone 4 or 4s
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:50.460]  I don't know which one but it had the 30 pin adapter and the thing
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:56.540]  but her husband had just gotten a new iphone and his came with lightning and lightning adapter and
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.260]  She was like, why did they do that?
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:04.620]  it's you know, and she and her her perspective was that they did it only to get them to buy a whole bunch of
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.980]  $29 cables lightning cables and that it was a ripoff
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:13.100]  But her annoyance was real in terms of like now like a 7.5
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:17.260]  In terms of like now like a single charger in the kitchen doesn't work for both of them
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.140]  And it's a short-term
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:25.180]  Problem. I I just kept my mouth shut. This is one of those things where people wonder people wonder like like
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:30.060]  What does john grueber do in that situation? You know what I do. I just pick up my beer and I take a sip
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.340]  and I keep my mouth shut and I look around and
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.940]  Make sure that my dad doesn't do something stupid and be like, well, john knows everything about apple
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:45.660]  John I you know, i'm like ready to bolt from the chair and maybe go join the wiffleball game or something like that
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:51.980]  Like I do not want to get involved. I do know I can explain to you now, you know that it is you know
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:58.780]  If they don't do it then we're stuck with 30-pin adapters forever and the 30-pin adapter was actually kind of gross
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:03.020]  It was like a weirdly unhappily type port
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.940]  That's it. Yeah, I mean people complained about that adapter for years
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.740]  Yeah, but it was weird and it served them well, they replaced it
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:18.700]  Right and they replaced it with a port that is much better in every way than 30-pin and much better in every way
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:19.960]  than
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.180]  Micro-usb
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.860]  It's more sturdy. It works up and down which is amazing
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.500]  And annoys me even more when I have to deal with usb stuff now
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:34.460]  And you know, they can either make a port that's better
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:36.860]  or they can never make a new port
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.300]  And apple's way is to do something better and within a few years
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:44.620]  All the phones that are in use and all the ipads that are in use will all be on lightning and nobody will have that
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.140]  Problem, but I do understand it's annoying but she it you know
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:55.420]  Didn't it never even entered into her the discussion it never even occurred to her that the lightning adapter on her husband's phone
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.980]  Was better was better. That's the thing that she completely clearly did not see
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.740]  Just completely missed all she could see was that it was totally different
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.220]  Totally different totally incompatible and therefore obviously a money grab
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.260]  and the thing that I think
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:16.700]  Hurts apple in that regard. I don't think that's even enters apple's mind at all. I think whatever profits
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:22.460]  I think they do make nice profits on 29 lightning adapters or 19 whatever they sell them for. Um
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:28.060]  But I don't I don't think materially that they they add up to you know
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:33.660]  Any significant part of their line item? Yeah, right, but I do think there's a customer satisfaction angle
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:40.140]  On there where it makes the experience better, right? Well, but no but that it it hurts
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:42.860]  it it
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.260]  When you use a lightning adapter, it does help your customer satisfaction and I think it you know
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:53.500]  If it's the only device you have instead of them using it instead of micro usb is why apple gets better scores
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:59.260]  gets better scores, but I do think there's a negative thing where people think they did this just to
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.300]  Practically steal 29 for me
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.180]  like I feel like maybe they
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.860]  they should rethink their pricing policy on things like extra adapters and and
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:17.180]  Should destroy their margins further again. I'm giving them advice that it will hurt their profit margins
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:25.020]  but I feel like whatever damage it would do to their profit margins to sell things like lightning adapters and
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.420]  You know
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.060]  Everything that they sell for 29 dollars or less
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:36.540]  All of those things if they you know, really drop the price on a lot of those things and sold them closer to cost
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:43.180]  The goodwill would be would be more valuable than whatever it would take to their profit margins is my theory
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:49.980]  Now again, there might be some guy at apple with a spreadsheet spreadsheet that says otherwise shaking his head. He's yeah, right, right
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:51.980]  I ran the numbers you're wrong
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:57.500]  And he doesn't even have an office chair. He just sits on a throne of hundred dollar bills
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:08.780]  It's just billion dollars in cash it's that mountain of cash that the joker set fire to in the batman movie
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:13.580]  Or batman movie. He's just sitting there up top there counting counting and lightning adapter
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:16.860]  one of those green eye shade things on
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:21.740]  But I do I think people have this notion that apple is out to
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:29.260]  Out to nickel and not nickel and dime yet because it's not quite nickel and diming like I do think people know that that they don't
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.620]  You don't you know
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.980]  I think that's part of the reason
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:35.740]  People are switching to max is that you don't open your mac and get nag to buy
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.840]  Antivirus and stuff like that that you open your mac and they don't ask you to buy anything else
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.480]  so it's not nickel and diming it's it's
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.040]  something else but that it's
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.760]  You know that they're they're looking for money, right?
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  And that this stuff is way too expensive
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.880]  And I think also it's maybe partly because they know who to blame they know to blame apple whereas in the old days
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.640]  Uh, it was notorious that every brand of phone had a different custom adapter for power
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.600]  Yeah, and that if you lost it god almighty or you know
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.320]  You'd have to go into the Verizon store AT&T or everybody about your phone
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.320]  And show them your phone and be like I need a model to each model
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.960]  Yeah, you couldn't just say I got a Nokia you'd be like, here's my here is my phone
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.800]  You know and they'd be like, oh you need the uh, xl47 8. Yeah, that'll be 50
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  Yeah, it was they were crazy expensive
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.520]  Or if you wanted to do like, you know
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.280]  You'd get one if you wanted to buy a second one so you could charge your phone at work, you know
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:37.280]  And keep your other one at home or something like that. They were super expensive way more expensive than apples
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.680]  But I feel like when it's your carrier doing it you just you don't even think to complain about it because you know
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.200]  They're going to screw you
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.880]  Whereas it I think people feel like apple shouldn't be screwing them. We had
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.560]  I mean we had collected so many of those dock connector
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.400]  Cords that I just you know, I had them lying all over the house
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.040]  So you could you could power a phone anywhere
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.120]  and now we're
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.260]  At a low point again until I build up my inventory
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.440]  Yeah, and somebody the other night just like a friend who lives up the street said said
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.920]  said they wanted to borrow one of those cables like a lightning cable for a week and I was like
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  Well, they can't have one of mine
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.600]  You've got an extra one you can give them give them yours, but i'm not parting with any of mine
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.440]  I like them. I don't like them that much. I got one more thing
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.680]  uh
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.680]  Do you hear this thing that um?
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.480]  uh
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.360]  Ryan block and
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:43.600]  The comcast thing yeah where they I didn't I can't I couldn't listen to it because it just those kinds of things make me
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.320]  Cringe, I only listen to about a minute for the same reason. Yeah
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.880]  but
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.880]  Yeah
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:57.920]  So ryan block and veronica belmont who uh, they got married a couple years ago
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.880]  And they decided to cancel their comcast service
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.440]  And apparently veronica was was on the phone was gonna you know, and that's doing one for the team is calling
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.400]  you know, that's that's one of those things where where when you're a
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.240]  couple
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.840]  When one of you decides i'll call comcast, you know, you you don't have to do the dishes that night, right?
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.440]  And she called just to say we want to cancel our comcast service, I don't know but it doesn't even matter
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.480]  I don't know if they're replacing it with fios or something like that. But um,
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.160]  Number one, you know that they those two know what they're doing
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.800]  Co-founder of uh
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.800]  Engadget and the host of like more tech tv shows than anybody I know
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.480]  Probably are making an informed decision to cancel comcast and you know, I don't know
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:54.960]  She just couldn't couldn't get the guy to cancel their service and and then had to hand the phone over to ryan
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.760]  And he started recording a call and it's just absurd
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.200]  I mean if you can take things like this you should and you haven't you should just google ryan block and veronica
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.200]  belmont canceled comcast
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.440]  It went viral as they say because the guy was it was just absurd the guys the guy was like
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.120]  Why do you want slower internet and ryan block was like why won't you just cancel?
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:21.600]  My service and he's like i'm trying to understand why you want to get slower internet
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:29.200]  And he's like i'm trying to understand why you won't cancel my service just cancel it. That's all I want to do
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.200]  And it went on and on it was like 10 minutes long and and the thing that's great is it went viral and the thing
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200]  about that is uh
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:43.760]  They had to like address it like comcast chief operating officer had to address it and say that it was painful to listen to this call
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.320]  And I am not surprised that we've been criticized for it
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.720]  Respecting our customers is fundamental and we fell short in this instance
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.080]  I know these retention calls. I guess it's an internal memo. It's not really meant for public
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.780]  Distribution these retention calls are tough and I have tremendous admiration for our retention professionals
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:08.160]  Make it easy for customers to choose to stay with comcast. Oh my god. That's so awful
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:14.720]  That's so that's actually even worse a number of sites and I I forget where I read it probably the verge or someplace but
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.040]  It wrote about the economics behind these people's jobs
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:20.800]  and
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:27.520]  basically their whole incentive their whole compensation package is wrapped up in the number of people that they can convince to stay
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.200]  You know, I thought that I just thought it from listening to the part of the call
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.160]  I heard was that the guy was into it enough or he was clearly not just into it enough
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.040]  Or he was clearly not just getting an hour, you know
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.200]  You know 20 bucks an hour. It was he was invested. It was a car salesman. Yeah, it's the reverse. Yeah, it's a
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.000]  It's like it's like a car salesman. It's like selling. It's like they're selling it all over again
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:57.360]  All right, but it's weird because it's like and car salesman. I'm sure you know, it's infamous famously shady, you know operators
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.840]  and they know all sorts of tricks, but it's like
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:06.640]  And i'm sure they take advantage of some people who who come in naive or who are timid
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.880]  You know, not that you and I are, you know tough guys
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.120]  Right, but it's like if we were in a car dealer you and I are going out to buy a convertible to spend it
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.360]  you know take a summer road trip and we're gonna buy a convertible you and I go in and
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.880]  We don't like what we're hearing and we start walking out the door and the guy tries to keep us from walking out the door
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.480]  And the guy tries to keep us from walking out the door. We're still walking out the door, right?
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:34.800]  You can just walk it like, you know as shady as a car dealer, you know dealer can be you know
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.520]  You can just keep moving your feet and eventually you are out the door and you're not listening to them anymore
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.480]  Whereas if you are already hooked up, that's the thing
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.760]  You're hooked up to to auto bill comcast a hundred dollars a month
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.480]  And even if you call your credit card and say don't pay them
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.800]  They're gonna you know, they're gonna put your account in collection until they officially disconnect you
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.240]  You're you've signed a thing that you're sending them a hundred dollars or you know
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:03.200]  150 a month you need them to do this and if they won't do it, what what can you do?
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.480]  This is such rotten double-speed
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.480]  And and Jackie Chang had posted uh on twitter that a reminder that and I forget the names of these services
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.720]  But those services that where you get people to do like a task for you task. Oh, yeah
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.760]  Yeah, you can you can actually call those guys and have them like disconnect, you know disconnect
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.960]  Disconnect your call comcast and disconnect your comcast for you
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:32.560]  So if you don't want to sit on the phone with that guy this you know what and it just ties right in with me
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.120]  Lincoln to the the george orwell, uh
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:42.260]  Politics in the english language like who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with comcast
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.120]  If that's not the most
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.680]  rotten
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:54.400]  Double speak i've ever heard that is so much more evil than if he just flat out said
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.680]  Who make it difficult for customers to leave?
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880]  right
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:09.440]  Right because it's exactly what it means it is exactly it is like like three plus three on one side and six on the other
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:17.440]  Who make it difficult for customers to leave comcast we have
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.440]  You you have comcast right? I do. I live in comcast country. Yeah, i'm in cable town, right?
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.080]  And literally our skype call is getting creaky
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.080]  I swear to god you can't make this up
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.320]  You you're starting to sound
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  I
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120]  Swear to god I you know
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.880]  Kind of pat myself on the back because we have here with takoma i've said this before we have city provided
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  internet service and so
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.200]  um
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.200]  I don't have to use comcast but
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.000]  But I but I do for our we have a landline
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.560]  We we in philadelphia have a comcast provided city
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:13.040]  They told you they literally they have the tallest skyscraper in philadelphia is the comcast center
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.440]  They've just bought a plot of land a block away and they are going to build
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  a new tallest skyscraper
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.840]  Your internet should be super fast. Yes. Thanks to them building two and completely
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  Really
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:31.980]  Non-disconnectable
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:39.420]  Anyway, what a rotten what a rotten rotten company comcast is this is terrible
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.700]  I don't know. That's it for me for this week though. You got anything? Okay
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:48.940]  Uh, did you did you talk about the microsoft layoffs? Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.820]  And that's that's honed
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.900]  18 000 people over the next year
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:59.900]  But 12, although 12,000 don't count because they're fine over something is from nukya. Yeah, they don't count
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.060]  Yeah
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.940]  No, I you know, I hate to make jokes about poor finland
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:08.380]  I you know, I don't want to make jokes about layoffs because you know who i'll bet there's got to be
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:11.900]  Somebody who listens to the show is one of them. So sure
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.740]  You know i've lost jobs and it's it's not fun
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.620]  I tried to get laid off for years. It didn't work
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:20.620]  So
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:26.300]  Worse it never happens to the people who want it. No, it never happens to the people who deserve it
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:35.580]  It's like we're gonna have some layoffs here's the list and then you raise your hand and you're like what about buyouts?
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.540]  Maybe we got molds. Maybe we could have buyouts too
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:44.940]  Early retirements, they knew I was good. They knew I was gonna leave that's why they didn't lay me off
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:48.140]  Yeah, uh, it's you know, it's kind of sad
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.780]  You know, yeah, I mean, you know, they kind of need it as a business, but yeah, it's not, you know
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:59.180]  It's not you know, we're good for the people in it. No, and it's you know, it's humbling because I think
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:05.180]  It's not that many years ago when the idea of a microsoft layoff would have been unthinkable
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:12.940]  Yeah, you know and it's a reminder, you know a wake-up call to everybody else, you know for companies like google and apple who are in
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:16.140]  amazon, who are the you know, the big
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:19.100]  tech companies of the last decade
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:24.060]  And we've never had a layoff that you know if it could happen to microsoft man, it could happen to anybody
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:30.620]  I mean apple's had layoffs but never like a mass layoff and it hasn't been not in the modern era of apple. Yeah
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:37.100]  You know, you got to be careful about getting fat tell me about it
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:44.140]  Did you read uh, ben thompson's piece on breaking microsoft up yeah, uh, that was it was a good piece
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:51.100]  I don't think it's gonna happen. No, I don't think so either because I think it it if it would have
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:56.300]  If that was on the table, it would have happened instead of this and would have happened maybe coincident with
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.460]  Satya's
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:08.220]  Nadella taking over, you know, I mean, I think that's an alternate universe where what do they do post balmer?
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:13.180]  Maybe is break it up, you know, whereas now I don't I don't think that they would do that
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:21.900]  I don't know that that's I mean, so just to recap his theory. I mean his idea is that microsoft is turning into a services company so that the
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:25.500]  hardware and operating system part should be
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:33.500]  Put into a different company and run separately. Yeah, it does make sense, you know, and there's a certain there's a certain
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.540]  What's the word?
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:38.540]  It just doesn't make sense. They're at odds
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:43.180]  With each other where there's a part of microsoft that sees it as a company that provides software to oems
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:46.540]  And now there's a part of come of the company that sees itself as an oem
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:49.260]  Right, and and that's just not compatible
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.100]  and
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:58.300]  They can kind of yada yada yada it to make it seem like it's compatible because the revenue and profits are still coming in
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:05.500]  But it just does it's at a common sense level. It just doesn't make sense that they can be providing these software to companies to make
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:09.340]  Mobile devices and they're going to make their own mobile devices
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:15.260]  Without favoring one or the other, you know, and everybody who's tried it. It never works, you know, so google, you know
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:19.180]  It's provide software to oems with a mobile device and they're going to make their own mobile devices
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:23.100]  You know, it's provide software to oems with android and they make their own android devices
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.620]  But uh, very few people use google's android devices
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:32.940]  They've never really taken off, you know, and if like the nexus in some alternate world where the nexus phones are huge hits
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:34.620]  uh
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:40.300]  That you know, samsung isn't going to be using android, you know, it's just you know, it just wouldn't work
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:45.740]  uh, you know and like go back to the 90s when apple licensed the mac os it
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.780]  It you know, just doesn't it didn't work. Yeah, so it's an interesting idea, but
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:54.220]  I just there's too much institutional
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.220]  I mean, I just there's no way they could get rid of windows
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.900]  No, I think you know, I I and I don't think it needs I just think windows could be run as its own division
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:07.900]  But I think that they should stop thinking of the windows division as anything other than legacy
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.220]  Just let it be what it is and it's pc operating system in an ever-shrinking market
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:17.260]  But that is huge and is probably, you know, eventually going to level off like the shrinkage
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:22.780]  You know, if like I just said to you the idc for this past quarter is that the pc market shrank two percent year over year
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:27.840]  It seems like maybe the bleeding is over, you know, I think it's going to keep dwindling and it's going to keep dwindling
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.860]  in terms of the overall pie chart of
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:39.100]  Computing devices because it's not just that smartphones and tablets are replacing pcs is that we're adding multiple devices, you know that are
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.340]  What used to be thought of as a pc?
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:46.540]  And that the share of them that are traditional pcs is getting smaller
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.780]  In addition to the fact that people are buying fewer actual units year over year
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:56.620]  But just let it run, you know, and I think that's the problem the whole basic problem with windows 8 is trying to make this
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:02.620]  You know trying to please two groups at once whereas if they had just made a windows 8 that was like windows 7 like here
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:05.420]  if you have a traditional laptop or a
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:09.580]  Traditional laptop or a desktop pc. Here you go
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:16.460]  Here's a new version of windows better than ever and we've got this other entirely new mobile operating system
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.180]  Yeah
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:23.900]  But it's weird now it's weird now that they you know, they're his nadella's whole memo was about
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:27.420]  You know, we're now a company that helps people get things done
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:30.140]  And they still have
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.820]  All this entertainment
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:32.780]  Yeah
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:33.740]  stuff
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.940]  They did nix. They did nix making tv shows. Yeah
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.620]  They've always had they still have the xbox which does not seem that does not fit into that mandate at all
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:49.420]  Yeah, and I think you know i've had that thought too i've tossed out ideas and i've thought like hey if netflix commissions tv shows
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:55.900]  Why doesn't apple commission tv shows, you know for apple tv and have you know new kevin spacey show that's only on apple tv
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:01.980]  But you know what they're that way lies lack of focus. I'm not saying apple would never do that particular thing, but
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:03.980]  You know, they certainly can't do all of them
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:06.300]  You know
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:12.700]  And I don't know making making tv shows was you know, never what microsoft was good at i've just i've always found that this whole thing
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:14.300]  that the
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.540]  These companies think that they need to do everything to be
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.060]  Counter-productive but
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:22.620]  What do I know? Yeah. Well, I do think that there's
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:28.460]  It's always seemed that way to me like I thought it was crazy in the 90s when when microsoft started
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:33.260]  Jointly with nbc the msnbc, uh, I was like, what are you doing?
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:37.100]  Why would you why would you want to make a cnn competitor? You're microsoft, you know
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:41.900]  You know what? I mean? Like I can see why somebody would want to make a cnn competitor, right?
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:47.420]  I can see why multiple people would but why would microsoft why you know, why do you feel like you need everything including a news?
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:52.860]  You know channel and and you know and the whole thing, you know wound up not working out that well
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:59.660]  I mean msnbc is a fine network, but I mean at microsoft the the ms and in msnbc hasn't stood from microsoft for
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.620]  I don't know the better part of the decade. I mean they've been out of that forever
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:08.140]  It's very strange we should have a kickstarter for us to buy microsoft
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:15.820]  I did see that they're you know that they uh, they're stocked they they did quarterly results today too
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:19.900]  And they they missed but only missed because of uh, nokia
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:26.940]  The nokia division which did a little bit worse than expected and the stock market reacted, you know with no reaction whatsoever
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:32.540]  No, I mean, I think it's right. I don't think anybody should have been surprised by that. Right? I think common sense prevails
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:38.380]  I don't know before we started recording. It looked like after hours apple was about even too. I don't know if it's still true, but
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:46.380]  That's always kind of that's getting weird like having having the stock market not panic after hours no matter what happens with apple
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:51.020]  Right. Yeah, it seems like that the whole that whole thing has kind of turned a bit
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:56.220]  Yeah, they seem they seem to be a little bit more uh happy with what's going on despite
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:58.700]  You know
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:05.900]  I mean the usual the usual suspects are still being jerks, but yeah, it looks like it's nice and even yeah sticking around 94 bucks
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:12.700]  Uh, you know, was it bad? It was ben thompson who was on the show that you know,
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:16.540]  Was it bad? It was ben thompson who was on the show a couple weeks ago
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:20.940]  And I thought it made a very keen observation that i've never really heard before which is that the stock market rule
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.500]  rewards
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:29.180]  The the gut feeling that even if you screw up you being the company that they're evaluating in a process
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:31.660]  Even if you screw up you'll still be in business
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:40.220]  And that that's where apple got hurt for years and years where there's just there used to be this consensus that apple was
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:46.060]  Consensus that apple was always on the precipice and one slip away from you know
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:51.180]  right the whole house of cards falling under and I feel like that they've you know,
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:57.980]  None of these dire things have happened like margins collapsing or whatever and everybody's sort of gotten the idea that hey apple could screw up
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:03.180]  You know, like they could release an iphone 6 that is not that popular and they are not going to go under
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:08.220]  you know, they could have the next I, you know, the next mac cube come out and uh,
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.500]  You know wouldn't be good wouldn't be good news, but it's not going to
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:15.500]  You know, it's not a house of cards. That's going to fall down. It's a sturdy foundation
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:19.100]  And it only took them 35 years to realize that
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.100]  Right slow learners. Yeah
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.500]  All right, john molts. Thank you for joining me. Thank you
