[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  No, seriously, do you, do you wear Polaroid sunglasses?
[00:03.840 --> 00:09.760]  I have sunglasses, I don't think they're Polaroids because I buy the cheapest ones possible.
[00:09.760 --> 00:13.840]  Because I sit on them and I lose them and so I gave up buying nice ones.
[00:13.840 --> 00:17.760]  Polarization, I'm not an optician, I'm not an optics guy.
[00:17.760 --> 00:21.880]  But the basic idea that it sounds kind of crazy, do you know what, how they work, they're
[00:21.880 --> 00:27.040]  like blinds, like horizontal blinds on the lenses, they're, you know, I don't even think
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.240]  that you can see them with the naked eye.
[00:30.240 --> 00:34.560]  But the idea is that it makes your glasses like blinds and then without reducing visibility
[00:34.560 --> 00:37.120]  it reduces glare.
[00:37.120 --> 00:44.440]  So like, for example, like people who work on the water, like fishermen, love Polaroid
[00:44.440 --> 00:50.600]  sunglasses because it cuts down on the glare from the water in front of them.
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.480]  But you know if you have Polaroid sunglasses or not because if you look at your iPhone or
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.600]  any kind of like LCD, it looks different.
[00:57.600 --> 00:58.600]  It looks crazy.
[00:58.600 --> 00:59.600]  It's like all rainbows.
[00:59.600 --> 01:02.040]  So then I do, then I do, yes, I do have Polaroids.
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.280]  You do have Polaroids, is I must because my phone looks, looks freaky.
[01:06.280 --> 01:09.920]  And at first, the first time I noticed that I thought that it was something wrong with
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.520]  the phone and then I realized I had bought new sunglasses.
[01:14.520 --> 01:19.800]  Yeah, that's exactly, it's exactly how, how this came to my mind.
[01:19.800 --> 01:27.800]  I actually, what happened is I had Marco Arment on the show last week and I heard an episode
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.880]  of his show from weeks ago where he was talking about the Warby Parker glasses and sunglasses
[01:34.880 --> 01:37.080]  and said that he likes Polaroid sunglasses.
[01:37.080 --> 01:40.520]  And I thought in the middle of listening to the show, that's crazy.
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.640]  How can someone, you know, who uses an iPhone all the time as I presume Marko does use
[01:45.640 --> 01:46.640]  Polaroid sunglasses?
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.120]  Like to me, the debate between whether you get Polaroid sunglasses or not is over now that
[01:51.120 --> 01:53.520]  we carry iPhones with this all over the place.
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.480]  Because it looks bad on your iPhone.
[01:55.480 --> 01:57.000]  It makes your iPhone look crazy.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.200]  It makes it look, to me, it makes it look unreadable.
[02:00.200 --> 02:03.280]  I could not bear to use my iPhone with sunglasses on.
[02:03.280 --> 02:12.240]  And yet I have my sunglasses on and I use my phone out and what do they call that daytime?
[02:12.240 --> 02:15.960]  And I wanted to talk to Marco about it, but we ran short of time because we did a quick
[02:15.960 --> 02:16.960]  show.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.440]  So I didn't get to bring it up to him.
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.400]  Is the effect the same in the casino?
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.920]  I would bet that it is given all the video poker machines.
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.920]  I'm sure.
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.920]  I was just trying to think of where you would be most likely to be using them.
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.120]  Well, and then the further confusing it in the casino is, you know, if you start seeing
[02:36.120 --> 02:41.840]  wavy lines and stuff, you never quite sure if it's your glasses or how long have I been
[02:41.840 --> 02:42.840]  here?
[02:42.840 --> 02:47.640]  Yeah, how long last time I saw the sun, right?
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.640]  What was that guy next to me smoking?
[02:53.640 --> 02:57.920]  He just never know what it is that's causing the wavy lines and Vegas.
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.800]  But anyway, that's actually what happened to me today.
[02:59.800 --> 03:06.560]  That reminded me that to bring it up with you, because I didn't bring it up with Marco,
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.360]  is that a couple of weeks ago I had Amy's old first original iPod out, the one with
[03:12.360 --> 03:14.520]  the wheel that actually spun.
[03:14.520 --> 03:17.880]  Just I don't know, for old times sake, and I think it was because it was like some kind
[03:17.880 --> 03:18.880]  of, I don't know.
[03:18.880 --> 03:19.880]  Yeah.
[03:19.880 --> 03:20.880]  I got it.
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.600]  I got it out, posted a picture on Instagram, got, you know, a couple of hundred likes.
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.920]  What if it's a beautiful device?
[03:26.920 --> 03:27.920]  It really is.
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.840]  It looks ancient now because it's so crazy thick because it has a big hard drive in it.
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.640]  But I had it out and it was in my office here next to my desk, next to a window in
[03:38.640 --> 03:39.640]  the sunshine.
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.240]  Amy was in here telling me something before she ran out for an air and she was like, why
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.240]  did you leave this?
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.160]  Because it's hers, not mine, actually.
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  That's the other thing.
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.320]  She got mad at me when I posted the Instagram because I made it look, I didn't say anything
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.920]  on Instagram.
[03:52.920 --> 03:59.160]  She says that's mine, not yours, and there, you know, there I'm stuck.
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.160]  You jacked her image.
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.840]  Yeah, I'm sleeping on the couch for three nights.
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.640]  But then she got mad at me because I wrecked it because I left it out in the sun for a
[04:07.640 --> 04:08.640]  couple of weeks.
[04:08.640 --> 04:13.000]  And I looked at it and I didn't really look weird to me and then she goes, oh, is that
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.320]  these sunglasses?
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.720]  Because it actually made the original iPod with her polarized sunglasses.
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.440]  It made it look as though it had a color screen, like a rainbow.
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.440]  Yeah.
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.560]  I was like, well that would have, now that actually would have been, to me, if you borrow
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.360]  your wife's original 2001 iPod and literally wreck it, it was, you know, it still
[04:38.360 --> 04:39.360]  works.
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.240]  That's the thing that's amazing to me is that if you can find a firewire cable, it still
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.240]  works.
[04:43.240 --> 04:45.400]  If I had actually wrecked it, that would justify some anger.
[04:45.400 --> 04:52.040]  So you're okay going blind as long as you can continue to look at your, going blind in
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.480]  the long-term as long as you can continue to look at your iPhone with crystal-clared
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.480]  clarity right now.
[04:57.480 --> 05:03.440]  I don't think non-polarized, unpolarized, whatever the word is, normal sunglasses are driving
[05:03.440 --> 05:04.440]  me blind.
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.440]  But I think it, you know, just, you have to put up with a little bit more glare.
[05:09.440 --> 05:18.360]  I actually am, you might be in the same situation, we're of similar vintage, I actually am having
[05:18.360 --> 05:26.160]  trouble starting to get the, as biopia, whatever it's called, in my left eye, not my right
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.440]  eye though, which I don't know if it's better or worse.
[05:29.440 --> 05:32.560]  I got it, I got it all for my body.
[05:32.560 --> 05:37.360]  What's it called? Is it, I looked at it a little bit and then I got scared and stopped.
[05:37.360 --> 05:44.800]  I had to finally buy a pair of those cheaters, reading glasses, just like cheap grocery
[05:44.800 --> 05:45.800]  store ones.
[05:45.800 --> 05:47.320]  How do they work?
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.320]  What did they do?
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.560]  It just makes it easier to see things close to you.
[05:50.560 --> 05:51.560]  How?
[05:51.560 --> 05:53.640]  I thought they just magnified.
[05:53.640 --> 05:54.640]  It's good.
[05:54.640 --> 05:56.600]  Yeah, I mean, that's well, well, it's the same thing.
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.600]  Yeah, but if I can.
[05:57.600 --> 06:02.600]  That's what, that's what classes, reader classes do.
[06:02.600 --> 06:03.600]  Yeah.
[06:03.600 --> 06:08.160]  You guys, you can see I'm really well informed about it.
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.600]  Yeah, we should really be having this conversation.
[06:10.600 --> 06:12.480]  I'll put that on myology.
[06:12.480 --> 06:13.760]  So, but you wear contacts.
[06:13.760 --> 06:14.760]  I do.
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.760]  Yeah, so do I.
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.080]  And I'm like, I'm practically blind without them.
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.320]  All right, so I think that's what I think that long range, that's what I think I need to do
[06:21.320 --> 06:25.960]  is I need to get like some kind of pair of glasses that I take around with me and put
[06:25.960 --> 06:26.960]  them on to read.
[06:26.960 --> 06:27.960]  Yeah.
[06:27.960 --> 06:28.960]  Yeah.
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.640]  It's a problem in restaurants now in low light situations, trying to read a, trying to read
[06:33.640 --> 06:34.640]  a menu.
[06:34.640 --> 06:35.640]  It's like.
[06:35.640 --> 06:36.640]  Yeah, it's just like.
[06:36.640 --> 06:42.240]  And I know, I know now what my parents went through and why they, you know, so we seem
[06:42.240 --> 06:43.240]  so annoying.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.240]  Just put the damn glasses on.
[06:44.240 --> 06:49.400]  And I know simply it, I know simply for my dad when he went through it at all, not, right?
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.400]  Not at all.
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.240]  I remember when my dad got his first pair of, my dad wears glasses and it has his entire
[06:56.240 --> 06:57.240]  adult life, I believe.
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.200]  I don't, I don't, I don't think I've seen a picture of my dad without glasses on since
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.800]  he was like a teenager.
[07:03.800 --> 07:09.040]  Um, I remember when he got bifocals and he really was struggling with them because it's
[07:09.040 --> 07:10.040]  weird.
[07:10.040 --> 07:13.280]  You have to like hold things at a weird angle and stuff and see if it was like, lift them
[07:13.280 --> 07:14.280]  on, lift them off.
[07:14.280 --> 07:20.880]  And I had, I had no sympathy for them on tour making fun of them.
[07:20.880 --> 07:21.880]  Yeah.
[07:21.880 --> 07:23.360]  I gotta look this up.
[07:23.360 --> 07:26.520]  The arrogance of youth.
[07:26.520 --> 07:27.520]  What's it called?
[07:27.520 --> 07:28.520]  Like presbyopia or something?
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.000]  I don't know.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Presbyterian?
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.920]  No, I think it's presbyopia.
[07:34.920 --> 07:42.080]  Yeah, presbyopia usually occurs beginning around age 40 when people experience blurred
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.360]  vision, near vision when reading, sewing or working at the computer.
[07:46.360 --> 07:49.920]  Karen got it before I did and she started wearing, she had never worn glasses and her
[07:49.920 --> 07:53.240]  vision was perfect, which I always found.
[07:53.240 --> 07:58.360]  And then she also kept saying things like, I think it'd be kind of cool to wear glasses.
[07:58.360 --> 08:00.960]  I think I'd look good in glasses.
[08:00.960 --> 08:06.040]  You're not going out and getting like blank glasses aware just to look like, just stop
[08:06.040 --> 08:07.040]  it.
[08:07.040 --> 08:12.480]  But then she got the reader glasses and like the first time I saw her wear and I'm just
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.080]  like, I go and go in and she's she's lying a bench, she's reading a book with those glasses
[08:16.080 --> 08:17.080]  on them.
[08:17.080 --> 08:24.680]  Oh, hey, we did a librarian, we did a kid in high school, we did a kid named a high school
[08:24.680 --> 08:31.640]  I'm not going to name names, I'm 99.9% sure he does not listen to the show.
[08:31.640 --> 08:40.200]  But you know, why name and name, but he was, he came in wearing glasses one day in high
[08:40.200 --> 08:42.440]  school, I don't know, 11th grade, 12th grade.
[08:42.440 --> 08:46.640]  And you know, so you don't want to say anything, you don't want to be the guy who makes
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.160]  fun of someone because they start wearing glasses.
[08:48.160 --> 08:51.960]  I actually had to start wearing glasses in high school, I also got contacts.
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.680]  So most of the time I didn't look different, but you know, I just, you don't want to
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.680]  be mature about it.
[08:58.680 --> 09:01.320]  You don't want to act like a fifth grade.
[09:01.320 --> 09:04.640]  But like within a day or two, it turned out that he didn't have prescription glasses.
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.480]  He just said glasses and he literally said, I think they make me look smart.
[09:10.480 --> 09:11.960]  And then we just tore into it.
[09:11.960 --> 09:15.800]  I mean, of course, it's like off to the races because all of a sudden instead of making
[09:15.800 --> 09:19.920]  fun of somebody for having, you know, a legitimate problem, you can.
[09:19.920 --> 09:20.920]  Yeah.
[09:20.920 --> 09:21.920]  Well, I've had bad ice hits.
[09:21.920 --> 09:22.920]  It's fourth grade.
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.600]  So, you know, I don't want to hear it like, I, you know, I've had to live, I've had to live
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.960]  with this pain for a long time.
[09:29.960 --> 09:32.240]  You're going to just wear them because you think they look good.
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.560]  I've told this story before.
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.080]  This is one of the, this might be the funniest thing that ever happened to me in my life.
[09:37.080 --> 09:41.280]  And I, I think I've told this story on this show before, but I bet it was years ago.
[09:41.280 --> 09:42.440]  So why not rehash it?
[09:42.440 --> 09:49.120]  It was sixth grade, and this kid, Dwayne, I'll name him Dwayne, Dwayne and I got sent down
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.920]  to the nurse together for the annual kids go down two by two and you got to get your eyes
[09:53.920 --> 09:56.240]  checked, right?
[09:56.240 --> 09:58.240]  And you, I don't know why they send you two by two.
[09:58.240 --> 10:00.440]  I don't think the nurse was very good with children.
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.560]  So she couldn't handle very many at a time.
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.200]  And so the lights are real low in the room because it's set up for like eye exams and
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.200]  there's a chair to wait and it's about halfway like between there's like a piece of tape
[10:12.200 --> 10:16.640]  on the ground where you stand and then there's a standard eye chart.
[10:16.640 --> 10:19.920]  And she said, you know, who wants to go first and Dwayne went first?
[10:19.920 --> 10:20.920]  I took a seat.
[10:20.920 --> 10:21.920]  I took a seat.
[10:21.920 --> 10:24.880]  I'm halfway to the sign and I thought, well, you know what, this would be so easy to
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.800]  cheat because it means it's the way my brain works is, look, I'm halfway there.
[10:29.800 --> 10:34.800]  I can just memorize the bottom line.
[10:34.800 --> 10:35.800]  I don't know.
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.520]  So I'm thinking about, you know, how, why wouldn't they, you know, proctor to this exam
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.120]  a little bit more on the up and up?
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.120]  In the meantime, and remember how they used to do it, they'd like, have you have you
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.120]  read?
[10:47.120 --> 10:48.120]  And it was the same thing every year.
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.360]  You have, you know, see which line you can read, cover the other eye, do it with the other
[10:51.360 --> 10:52.360]  eye.
[10:52.360 --> 10:56.560]  And then they at our school, they used to give us a pair of glasses and they were like,
[10:56.560 --> 11:00.440]  they look like Warby Parker's now, they're like, I guess, you know, they're like what looks
[11:00.440 --> 11:02.400]  cool now, like black chunky glasses.
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.680]  But like in the 80s, they were the worst glasses you can imagine.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.880]  And they were real thick.
[11:06.880 --> 11:07.880]  And it was the same pair.
[11:07.880 --> 11:08.880]  They just put them on.
[11:08.880 --> 11:10.880]  And then what do you see?
[11:10.880 --> 11:12.880]  When I put them on, it's like you could almost see nothing.
[11:12.880 --> 11:16.480]  I mean, like the whole world just, it's like Vaseline on your eyes.
[11:16.480 --> 11:19.400]  And then, you know, this is the six grade, same school all six years.
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.640]  So it's like the six time I've done this.
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.360]  And I'm sitting there and I'm, you know, bored and I'm listening and she's like, what
[11:25.360 --> 11:26.360]  about this row?
[11:26.360 --> 11:27.840]  What about this row?
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.320]  And Dwayne can't see any other rows.
[11:30.320 --> 11:37.880]  He couldn't even see the big E at the top and I started giggling and then she had them cover
[11:37.880 --> 11:38.880]  his other eye.
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.440]  And it was the same thing he couldn't read a damn thing on the eye chart.
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.440]  And I was just dying.
[11:45.440 --> 11:53.680]  I was like, oh my god, this guy, he's like involved and then she goes, what if you
[11:53.680 --> 11:54.680]  try these on?
[11:54.680 --> 12:01.400]  And she gives them this pair of glasses and everybody had to try and he goes, oh, wow.
[12:01.400 --> 12:03.640]  And I just died.
[12:03.640 --> 12:09.240]  And I just like fell out of my chair laughing and Dwayne is like, no, I didn't know I was
[12:09.240 --> 12:11.600]  supposed to see like this.
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.320]  Dwayne has not seen the board in like three years.
[12:15.320 --> 12:18.120]  And then nurse turns to me and she goes, do you think something's funny?
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.120]  Yeah.
[12:19.120 --> 12:21.520]  And I said he can't see anything.
[12:21.520 --> 12:29.400]  And he had, Dwayne had good parents, you know, I think his mom was even a nurse, you know,
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.400]  a nurse's kids are always, you know, it's not like he didn't have health care or anything.
[12:33.400 --> 12:35.760]  I just like never reported it.
[12:35.760 --> 12:37.480]  He never like noticed.
[12:37.480 --> 12:41.800]  And somehow he, I don't know if he had had a really bad year between fifth and sixth grade.
[12:41.800 --> 12:46.520]  If he, you know, been absent the year before when they did the same thing.
[12:46.520 --> 12:53.160]  But lo and behold, like two days later, Dwayne comes in wearing the biggest glasses.
[12:53.160 --> 12:56.840]  Oh my god.
[12:56.840 --> 12:57.840]  Yeah.
[12:57.840 --> 12:59.920]  Hank's got glasses too.
[12:59.920 --> 13:01.400]  He doesn't have to wear him that much.
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.920]  I say it's pretty, pretty good.
[13:02.920 --> 13:04.240]  It's just mild.
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.200]  But is it distance or close distance?
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.520]  And man, the first, the first pair that he got were, was the spider man glasses.
[13:13.520 --> 13:15.760]  Oh, I remember seeing a picture of him with those.
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.760]  That's a cool.
[13:16.760 --> 13:17.760]  Yeah.
[13:17.760 --> 13:18.760]  They were, they were, and they were Oscars.
[13:18.760 --> 13:19.920]  They were very subtly spider man.
[13:19.920 --> 13:22.760]  The case was, was kind of spider man dubbed.
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.760]  But the, the glasses themselves looked like sort of Warby Parkerish, except they just
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.400]  had a little like spider web on the, on the things on the side.
[13:32.400 --> 13:34.720]  And I thought, oh man, I'd wear those.
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.640]  I see a lot more kids at Jonas' School wearing glasses than when I was a kid, when I was
[13:39.640 --> 13:42.400]  a kid, it, it, it just seemed pretty rare.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.560]  They were only a handful of kids who wore glasses.
[13:44.560 --> 13:45.560]  Yeah.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.560]  Seems pretty common now.
[13:46.560 --> 13:49.520]  I can't even wait to see what happens to these kids, you know, they say that standing,
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.480]  you know, being a foot away from a glowing computer screen for hours a day is back for
[13:54.480 --> 13:55.480]  your eyes.
[13:55.480 --> 13:57.680]  Can you even imagine how much worse it's going to be for these kids?
[13:57.680 --> 14:02.280]  I can't even imagine, you know, our kids are going to need corrective surgery because
[14:02.280 --> 14:05.480]  I feel like with us, like we were, I mean, even when we were playing video games, I
[14:05.480 --> 14:06.480]  get an arcade or something.
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.720]  I mean, the, the, the CRTs were so fuzzy, you didn't really have to focus that what that
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.720]  closely.
[14:11.720 --> 14:12.720]  Yeah.
[14:12.720 --> 14:13.720]  I think that was good for us.
[14:13.720 --> 14:18.360]  And you couldn't afford to play for, you know, as long as they can now.
[14:18.360 --> 14:23.560]  I always think that I do think of that whenever the people complain about the in-app
[14:23.560 --> 14:27.440]  purchases, it's like to realize how much money it cost me to play video games.
[14:27.440 --> 14:28.920]  I worked as a teenager.
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.760]  I worked at a video arcade and man, man, I spent, I spent everything.
[14:34.760 --> 14:35.760]  You peaked early.
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.080]  The place, the whole thing was I had the key to the place left without a paycheck every
[14:41.080 --> 14:42.080]  week.
[14:42.080 --> 14:43.080]  Yeah.
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.400]  Basically, but I had the key to the place.
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.880]  And so I like on Saturday night, I would take my friends and when it was closed, we would
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.360]  just go down and open it up and lock the door and just stand there and play video games.
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.360]  What was your favorite video game in that arcade?
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.440]  Oh, my favorite all time, I'm not sure if it was in that one or not was Tempest.
[15:00.440 --> 15:02.440]  Ooh, that's a good game.
[15:02.440 --> 15:03.440]  I love all the bonuses.
[15:03.440 --> 15:04.440]  Still love that.
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.480]  All the vector art games.
[15:06.480 --> 15:07.480]  Yeah.
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.480]  Yeah.
[15:08.480 --> 15:09.480]  Those were all good.
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.480]  Yeah.
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.480]  Star Wars.
[15:11.480 --> 15:12.480]  Yeah.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.480]  Star Wars one.
[15:13.480 --> 15:14.480]  Battlezone.
[15:14.480 --> 15:15.480]  Battlezone.
[15:15.480 --> 15:16.480]  Yeah.
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.440]  I guess asteroids was vector graphics too.
[15:18.440 --> 15:20.200]  I never really thought about that.
[15:20.200 --> 15:23.800]  But now that I think about the way that asteroids looked, I think it was.
[15:23.800 --> 15:24.800]  Yeah.
[15:24.800 --> 15:27.840]  And there were a number of asteroids rip offs that were pretty good too.
[15:27.840 --> 15:28.840]  Yeah.
[15:28.840 --> 15:37.920]  I remember my favorite neighborhood arcade growing up had spy hunter always a favorite.
[15:37.920 --> 15:44.880]  And er Kung Fu, that's that that's that I know Dan Benjamin and I talked at length
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.560]  about er Kung Fu years ago on on the show.
[15:48.560 --> 15:49.560]  He was a big fan.
[15:49.560 --> 15:50.560]  Do you remember that game?
[15:50.560 --> 15:52.240]  I don't because I missed that phase.
[15:52.240 --> 15:53.240]  Yeah.
[15:53.240 --> 15:57.040]  That whole fighter thing came a little bit after my time.
[15:57.040 --> 15:58.040]  Yeah.
[15:58.040 --> 16:02.400]  Kung Fu was like one of the first ones, Google it after the show.
[16:02.400 --> 16:09.640]  And you'll see from the graphics quality, it was it was pre like Street Fighter.
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.160]  It was a lot more like Pac-Man era graphics.
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.160]  Even had like that.
[16:16.160 --> 16:19.680]  I know it was made I might have been made by the same company as Pac-Man because I had
[16:19.680 --> 16:27.080]  that same exact same high score font same basic idea though where you fight you know two
[16:27.080 --> 16:31.440]  guys fight side by side, but it was it was an older older version of it.
[16:31.440 --> 16:32.440]  Great.
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.040]  Oh man, arcades.
[16:35.040 --> 16:38.640]  I think going on this week.
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.880]  I don't think so.
[16:39.880 --> 16:40.880]  All right.
[16:40.880 --> 16:41.880]  I'll take a break.
[16:41.880 --> 16:42.880]  Let's get it out of the way.
[16:42.880 --> 16:43.880]  Let's do a sponsor.
[16:43.880 --> 16:44.880]  Okay.
[16:44.880 --> 16:45.880]  Great friends.
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.080]  Let's let's talk about backplays.
[16:49.080 --> 16:51.560]  One time sponsor of the show.
[16:51.560 --> 16:52.560]  What do they do?
[16:52.560 --> 16:53.560]  Easy.
[16:53.560 --> 17:00.320]  Unlimited, unprodled back up for your Macintosh computers, what do you mean unlimited?
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.240]  Doesn't matter how much you have to store.
[17:02.240 --> 17:06.640]  If you can get it through the internet to their servers, you can back it up.
[17:06.640 --> 17:09.920]  Might take you a couple weeks, took me a couple weeks to get my whole thing backed up.
[17:09.920 --> 17:10.920]  It's all right.
[17:10.920 --> 17:12.120]  It'll be it for me.
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.800]  There's like a 30 day free trial, no credit card required.
[17:16.800 --> 17:19.760]  You'll probably if you have any kind of decent bandwidth, you'll get it up before the
[17:19.760 --> 17:23.840]  end of the, you'll get everything up before the end of the 30 days, it doesn't matter.
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.960]  But then once you do, once you have that first backup up, everything else is incremental,
[17:28.960 --> 17:31.120]  of course, doesn't take long.
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.320]  And while it's backing up, you can, you can even use it.
[17:35.320 --> 17:40.480]  You can start to use it with whatever it's already been backed up.
[17:40.480 --> 17:42.480]  But what about getting it back?
[17:42.480 --> 17:43.480]  Here's the thing.
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.680]  This is one of the stats that they've given me.
[17:44.680 --> 17:48.800]  They've just crossed the six billion files restored mark.
[17:48.800 --> 17:56.040]  In other words, in the aggregate, users of backplays have restored six billion files.
[17:56.040 --> 17:57.440]  It's amazing.
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.280]  They have over 100 petabytes of data backed up.
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.640]  One petabyte is a thousand terabytes and a terabyte is huge.
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.640]  So they've got tons of storage.
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.840]  They've restored tons of files and it's great software.
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.840]  You can restore one file or all your files.
[18:16.840 --> 18:18.800]  You can do it over the web.
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.400]  You can pay them to put everything onto a hard drive and ship it to you.
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.640]  Anything you'd think that an online has everything backed up system could do.
[18:29.640 --> 18:30.640]  Backplays does.
[18:30.640 --> 18:36.280]  Founded by X Apple engineers, it's really great native software for your Mac.
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.720]  There's no add-ons, no gimmicks, no additional charges.
[18:39.720 --> 18:43.240]  Five bucks a month per computer.
[18:43.240 --> 18:44.240]  Five bucks a month.
[18:44.240 --> 18:45.240]  I've been talking about this for a while.
[18:45.240 --> 18:48.400]  It's the best five bucks a month you can spend.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.560]  Great, great service.
[18:49.560 --> 18:50.960]  Here's where you go to find out more.
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.480]  Go to backblaze.com slash daringfireball.
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.440]  They'll know you came from the show and just start.
[19:00.440 --> 19:01.760]  No credit card required.
[19:01.760 --> 19:02.760]  Just go there.
[19:02.760 --> 19:03.760]  Sign up.
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.760]  Backblaze.
[19:04.760 --> 19:13.880]  What if we crossed off the list of our Polarize sunglasses and arcade games and pressed
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.040]  byopia?
[19:18.040 --> 19:18.880]  Here's the weird thing.
[19:18.880 --> 19:22.280]  I didn't know this.
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.320]  With my left eye, if I close my right eye, I actually really ought to be honest.
[19:26.320 --> 19:28.320]  I can't read my eye phone anymore.
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.800]  If it's just with my left eye.
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.720]  If I close my left eye, I can read it with my right eye, just like I've always done before.
[19:35.720 --> 19:39.120]  And for some odd reason, with both eyes open, it looks even better.
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.720]  I don't know how that works.
[19:41.720 --> 19:46.680]  Even though my left eye can't focus it, it somehow looks better in my head with both
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.760]  eyes open.
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.280]  But obviously, if it's just happened in my left eye in the past year, my right eye is
[19:53.280 --> 19:58.440]  probably whatever it is in there.
[19:58.440 --> 20:02.520]  Whatever mechanism it is in there that lets you focus both at the long distance and short
[20:02.520 --> 20:03.520]  range.
[20:03.520 --> 20:06.280]  It's probably all rusted out.
[20:06.280 --> 20:11.400]  It's like one loose screw in there.
[20:11.400 --> 20:18.880]  It's like the Millennium Falcon ever drive.
[20:18.880 --> 20:24.200]  I had no idea, but I thought, too, the thing is that at distance, my left eye was also
[20:24.200 --> 20:25.200]  a little blurry.
[20:25.200 --> 20:28.680]  And I thought, oh, I just need a new prescription.
[20:28.680 --> 20:32.120]  And so I went to the eye doctor and got in there, like, yep, your left eye got a little
[20:32.120 --> 20:33.200]  worse since last year.
[20:33.200 --> 20:34.200]  You need a new prescription.
[20:34.200 --> 20:35.200]  Here you go.
[20:35.200 --> 20:37.200]  Here's a sample contact lens.
[20:37.200 --> 20:38.200]  Try this out.
[20:38.200 --> 20:39.200]  Try it out.
[20:39.200 --> 20:42.800]  And close distance stuff got worse, like way worse.
[20:42.800 --> 20:44.720]  And I was like, uh-oh.
[20:44.720 --> 20:47.600]  So I went back and needed to take a lot for me to go back to a doctor.
[20:47.600 --> 20:51.840]  And I was like, I just thought everything was blurry and I got this new thing.
[20:51.840 --> 20:55.480]  And I have to tell you, I see great at a distance with this new contact lens.
[20:55.480 --> 20:57.000]  But like, reading is worse.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.400]  And the eye doctor looks at me and he's like, yeah, it's like, that's how it works.
[21:03.400 --> 21:10.040]  Like the stronger, the stronger the nearsighted prescription is, the worse it makes the
[21:10.040 --> 21:13.200]  the inability to focus at close levels.
[21:13.200 --> 21:14.200]  Right.
[21:14.200 --> 21:21.040]  So now I'm so old that I have to choose between what I want to be able to see.
[21:21.040 --> 21:22.040]  Yeah.
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.040]  It's pretty sad.
[21:23.040 --> 21:31.520]  I was just, at this point, and any native culture worth that salt would have just piled
[21:31.520 --> 21:36.640]  some sticks around me and just left me there, continued on without me.
[21:36.640 --> 21:43.360]  This left a little marker, just so I could pass away peacefully without being eaten
[21:43.360 --> 21:48.520]  by the animals.
[21:48.520 --> 21:49.520]  So I'm out here.
[21:49.520 --> 21:50.520]  I am.
[21:50.520 --> 21:51.520]  I'm 41.
[21:51.520 --> 21:55.240]  I think, yeah, 41.
[21:55.240 --> 21:59.360]  And I've always felt, I felt so good for years that Derek Jeter is still playing.
[21:59.360 --> 22:03.520]  Derek Jeter is one year younger than me, he's 40, but he's still the starting short stop
[22:03.520 --> 22:06.600]  for the New York Yankees and he's retiring after this year.
[22:06.600 --> 22:13.560]  I cannot, however, much better, you know, physical condition Derek Jeter has always been
[22:13.560 --> 22:24.120]  in me as him being a world-class athlete and me being a guy who sits in a chair.
[22:24.120 --> 22:27.360]  The difference at age 40, 41, is profound.
[22:27.360 --> 22:34.960]  He's still the starting short stop for the Yankees and I can't read my iPhone.
[22:34.960 --> 22:39.000]  Like I really feel like this is the beginning of the part where you just, everything,
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.080]  I just start falling apart.
[22:41.080 --> 22:42.080]  Yeah.
[22:42.080 --> 22:49.040]  I'm going to age this year, so I decided to, if I was ever going to get back and shape it,
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.040]  or get in shape.
[22:50.040 --> 22:51.040]  It was kind.
[22:51.040 --> 22:52.040]  It was 10 years ago.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.040]  I need to start.
[22:53.040 --> 22:56.640]  Yeah, so I need to start a long time ago, but now, like, that's now for sure.
[22:56.640 --> 23:01.920]  So I started exercising again and I went to the doctor and I had everything, I'm having
[23:01.920 --> 23:02.920]  everything done.
[23:02.920 --> 23:08.560]  Wait, you did have every possible, every possible test is being, is being run.
[23:08.560 --> 23:13.080]  Some of them, some of them will take, you know, months to complete.
[23:13.080 --> 23:17.280]  Can we do a special episode of the talk show with a camera for this?
[23:17.280 --> 23:20.200]  I think once that, nobody wants that.
[23:20.200 --> 23:21.680]  I think this could be a very special episode.
[23:21.680 --> 23:25.120]  The doctor doesn't want to be there.
[23:25.120 --> 23:27.320]  Nobody, I don't want to be there.
[23:27.320 --> 23:29.840]  Your listeners definitely don't want to be there.
[23:29.840 --> 23:24.200]  Did you see that, T
[23:24.200 --> 23:35.560]  I don't know how to get this year about the guy who asked his doctor if he could check
[23:35.560 --> 23:39.080]  if he has a Darth Vader up his, up his butt.
[23:39.080 --> 23:40.080]  No.
[23:40.080 --> 23:42.480]  I don't want to spoil it.
[23:42.480 --> 23:44.800]  It's, it's worth it though.
[23:44.800 --> 23:48.120]  Just, honestly, I'm just going to write down here at Google.
[23:48.120 --> 23:49.120]  Yeah.
[23:49.120 --> 23:52.520]  That's now Darth Vader up my butt.
[23:52.520 --> 23:55.160]  Speaking of Star Wars.
[23:55.160 --> 23:57.400]  Oh man, going to doctors is fun.
[23:57.400 --> 23:58.400]  Yeah.
[23:58.400 --> 24:00.520]  Yeah, speaking of Star Wars.
[24:00.520 --> 24:04.600]  New X-Wing, which is what everybody's talking about, even though the whole thing was supposed
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.600]  to be about a charity.
[24:05.600 --> 24:06.600]  Exactly.
[24:06.600 --> 24:09.400]  I thought of that, too, after I leaked it.
[24:09.400 --> 24:10.400]  Hey, look at the X-Wing.
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.160]  It really sounds like a great cause, like a truly great cause.
[24:15.160 --> 24:20.040]  I think it's awesome.
[24:20.040 --> 24:21.080]  I love it.
[24:21.080 --> 24:22.080]  Yeah.
[24:22.080 --> 24:26.240]  I think that these little teasers where they're shooting them on these practical sets.
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.680]  And I know that they said, you know, it was a thing they said when they announced they
[24:29.680 --> 24:32.360]  were going to do episode seven.
[24:32.360 --> 24:36.160]  And they were going to, you know, with JJ Abrams directing and they even said, right up front,
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.640]  we're going to, you know, we're going to dial a little back on the computer graphics
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.440]  and dial it back up a little bit on the practical special effects.
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.200]  But actions speak louder than words and just seeing something like a real full life-size
[24:48.200 --> 24:50.600]  X-Wing is awesome.
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.600]  Right.
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.680]  Cause I remember a story when we were kids.
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.320]  And I don't know if it was after all three movies or just after, you know, somewhere in
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.720]  a run when Star Wars was, you know, the original trilogy was being made.
[25:03.720 --> 25:06.680]  And I remember seeing a story in a magazine about a guy, you know, and they built, you
[25:06.680 --> 25:11.160]  know, practical sized X-Wings.
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.880]  And it might have been like like 19, you know, after the 77, 1977 original.
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.920]  And some guy in California bought one of them and put it in his backyard.
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.920]  He like, you know, he just like bought it and there was a guy who had like a life-size
[25:23.920 --> 25:26.440]  X-Wing in his backyard.
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.240]  And I, as a kid, all I could think is that is the coolest thing I've ever heard of.
[25:31.240 --> 25:35.320]  And I, if I had that, I would go in and sit in the X-Wing every day.
[25:35.320 --> 25:36.320]  Yeah.
[25:36.320 --> 25:43.440]  Now as an adult, I look back and I think I can see being stupid enough to buy it.
[25:43.440 --> 25:47.240]  If I had a backyard that could fit it and I could see being stupid enough to pay someone
[25:47.240 --> 25:48.920]  to put it there.
[25:48.920 --> 25:53.080]  And then the next day I would wake up and then what the hell am I going to do with the X-Wing
[25:53.080 --> 25:54.080]  in my backyard?
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.480]  Oh, what did I buy last night?
[25:59.480 --> 26:04.360]  So the couple of years ago, or maybe a little bit more, there was a project going on
[26:04.360 --> 26:07.440]  to build a full-size Millennium Falcon.
[26:07.440 --> 26:08.440]  Oh, I saw that.
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.880]  And they were like building it in the forest or someplace.
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.840]  I can't remember where they were doing it, but they had like, they had bought some land.
[26:15.840 --> 26:18.680]  And they were building a full-size Millennium Falcon.
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.000]  I wonder, I wonder like, what did they do with like the full-size Millennium?
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.680]  The real full-size Millennium Falcon, they built back in 77.
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.560]  I presume they kept it around for the next two movies.
[26:32.560 --> 26:35.520]  And so the one you saw in Empire was the same one.
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.520]  I'm not sure.
[26:36.520 --> 26:38.960]  Was there ever really a full-size one built?
[26:38.960 --> 26:44.880]  Because they might have just done the door and done the rest with a map painting.
[26:44.880 --> 26:46.920]  I think they're not sure.
[26:46.920 --> 26:52.000]  There's something pretty big in the scene where they're loading up.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.520]  Yeah, I don't think it's a mad painting.
[26:54.520 --> 27:00.440]  I don't know if it's truly full-size and articulated from every angle, but the one and
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.840]  most eyesly where they're getting on the ship and all of a sudden it's like a race against
[27:05.840 --> 27:14.440]  time because the stormtroopers are setting up, they come in and just set up guns.
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.920]  But that's clearly a pretty big physical thing there.
[27:19.920 --> 27:26.200]  And think about it, when they're shooting off the minox inside the dinosaur in the asteroid
[27:26.200 --> 27:27.760]  in the next movie.
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.440]  And on hot, there's a pretty big, you know, like when Chewie's up there fixing it.
[27:31.440 --> 27:33.440]  Yeah, there's a big Millennium Falcon.
[27:33.440 --> 27:34.440]  I don't know.
[27:34.440 --> 27:37.800]  It may not be articulated on all sides, I don't know.
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.720]  But visually, the Millennium Falcon was represented by several models and external and internal
[27:42.720 --> 27:43.720]  sets.
[27:43.720 --> 27:48.960]  For Star Wars, a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as docking Bay
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.960]  94 and the Death Star Hanger.
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.160]  Oh, do you think did they, were they not able to move that?
[27:57.160 --> 28:02.680]  And then they changed the most eyesly docking bay to become the Death Star?
[28:02.680 --> 28:03.680]  That would be cool.
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.680]  Oh, maybe.
[28:04.680 --> 28:05.680]  How about that?
[28:05.680 --> 28:06.680]  Maybe they did.
[28:06.680 --> 28:07.680]  Is that what that says?
[28:07.680 --> 28:08.680]  It would be because of that.
[28:08.680 --> 28:12.240]  Yeah, because docking Bay 94, that was the one, that was the most eyesly.
[28:12.240 --> 28:13.240]  Right.
[28:13.240 --> 28:14.240]  Yeah.
[28:14.240 --> 28:16.240]  But it does say partial exterior set.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.240]  Yeah.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.240]  So anyway, New Echo.
[28:18.240 --> 28:20.560]  I think it's pretty cool.
[28:20.560 --> 28:21.560]  Yeah.
[28:21.560 --> 28:24.880]  I'm kind of, I'm kind of pro these movies.
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.440]  I know some people are concerned.
[28:28.440 --> 28:36.200]  I think a lot of people are age have a subscribe to, and it's a sensible maxim.
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.600]  But the full me once, shame on you, full me twice, shame on me.
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.800]  And so they are not going to get excited about the new trilogy until after it comes out.
[28:45.800 --> 28:46.800]  No way.
[28:46.800 --> 28:47.800]  No how.
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.560]  There's no chance that it's not going to be better than the last three.
[28:52.560 --> 28:57.360]  And the last three left such a bad taste of my mouth that I'm happy to have pretty much
[28:57.360 --> 28:58.360]  anything.
[28:58.360 --> 29:03.760]  I got confused by your sentence because of the two negatives, but I, right?
[29:03.760 --> 29:08.160]  You said there's no chance that it's not going to be better, which means it has to be better.
[29:08.160 --> 29:10.440]  What you're trying to say has to be better has to be better.
[29:10.440 --> 29:11.440]  Yes.
[29:11.440 --> 29:12.920]  I think that I agree.
[29:12.920 --> 29:20.040]  I, you know, Larry Cassidy's involved on the screenplay, Abrams is good.
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.040]  Yeah.
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.680]  I think Abrams' worst movie is better than, than knows.
[29:24.680 --> 29:25.680]  Yes.
[29:25.680 --> 29:26.680]  We've said this before.
[29:26.680 --> 29:29.080]  I've said this numerous times whenever Star Wars comes up on the show though.
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.800]  You have to understand now that for like our kids generation, the, the, they're all
[29:34.800 --> 29:35.800]  blurred together.
[29:35.800 --> 29:39.240]  My son, Jonas still has no idea which ones are the old ones and the new ones.
[29:39.240 --> 29:43.400]  And I am like, how can you not tell the difference that there are three movies that are
[29:43.400 --> 29:45.000]  very, very different?
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.480]  And that when I was your age, we thought return of the Jedi was the bad one.
[29:49.480 --> 29:51.640]  And now we think, oh, that was a great movie.
[29:51.640 --> 29:52.640]  Yeah.
[29:52.640 --> 29:53.640]  Really.
[29:53.640 --> 29:54.640]  Thanks.
[29:54.640 --> 29:58.600]  Still has not seen the prequels here hardcore.
[29:58.600 --> 29:59.600]  I am.
[29:59.600 --> 30:00.600]  Yeah.
[30:00.600 --> 30:05.360]  I mean, for the, and he's not as, he, he loved the Clone Wars TV series.
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.360]  Yeah.
[30:06.360 --> 30:09.840]  And he's seen the, the first three movies.
[30:09.840 --> 30:13.080]  And then I was like, and then I was finally, I was like, okay, if you want to, we could
[30:13.080 --> 30:17.320]  watch the other movies and it's like, no, you and Siri, you and John, Siri, kiss it
[30:17.320 --> 30:18.320]  or like the founder.
[30:18.320 --> 30:19.320]  Yeah.
[30:19.320 --> 30:22.440]  But for a while, it was, it was a very, when he was really kind of into, he was into
[30:22.440 --> 30:28.000]  the movies themselves for a while before he got into the, the Clone Wars show.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.760]  And I think at that point he asked, he, it was, he asked a lot of questions about the
[30:31.760 --> 30:32.760]  other three movies.
[30:32.760 --> 30:36.280]  And I was like, like, I, they're not any good.
[30:36.280 --> 30:37.280]  Wow.
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.280]  We don't have them.
[30:38.280 --> 30:42.280]  They don't exist.
[30:42.280 --> 30:52.800]  I do, I worry, I worry about those movies because they came from the same guy.
[30:52.800 --> 30:56.960]  And it's, you know, talking about getting older and you know, and there's, there's, I don't
[30:56.960 --> 30:57.960]  even know how true this is.
[30:57.960 --> 30:58.960]  I'm not a doctor.
[30:58.960 --> 31:03.800]  But they say that like, you know, I for, within every few years, every single cell in
[31:03.800 --> 31:07.960]  your body dies and is replaced throughout the cycle of life.
[31:07.960 --> 31:12.480]  So like, I don't know, within like 10 years, every cell in your brain has died and been
[31:12.480 --> 31:13.480]  replaced.
[31:13.480 --> 31:17.160]  You know, and I, you know, I think hopefully, you know, that they, you know, the reason
[31:17.160 --> 31:21.440]  you can have any kind of memories that last longer than that is that, I don't know,
[31:21.440 --> 31:26.000]  the way shit gets stored is, you know, like, hey, I'm, I'm going out.
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.560]  I've got a memory of a dig dug in 1984.
[31:29.560 --> 31:32.160]  And then the news neuron comes in and goes, all right, got it.
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.400]  I got it, right.
[31:35.400 --> 31:36.400]  But I don't know.
[31:36.400 --> 31:38.760]  There is something, nice job enjoy your retirement.
[31:38.760 --> 31:44.040]  There is something that happened to George Lucas as he got older that is just very, I
[31:44.040 --> 31:46.720]  mean, he might be, it seems like a very nice man.
[31:46.720 --> 31:49.240]  And, you know, and I think he's had a very happy life.
[31:49.240 --> 31:56.120]  But as an artist, the guy that the guy who made THX 1138 eventually made the Phantom
[31:56.120 --> 32:01.160]  Menace is just mind-boggling and that it wasn't because it's like a work for hire, you
[32:01.160 --> 32:04.960]  know, it's like, I, you know, got to do it for the money, it's like, he funded the whole
[32:04.960 --> 32:05.960]  thing himself.
[32:05.960 --> 32:09.600]  I think he got to do it exactly as he wanted.
[32:09.600 --> 32:15.160]  Like, he, he set everything up, like, and that's what was so, that to me is, it was
[32:15.160 --> 32:19.960]  why those movies were so profoundly disappointing was that he, it, it always impressed
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.920]  me that, that in a very different way than like Stanley Kubrick, that he, he was a guy
[32:24.920 --> 32:29.360]  who wanted to do things his own way outside the studio system, you know, I always thought
[32:29.360 --> 32:33.160]  it was cool, everybody knew, you know, he wasn't Los Angeles-based, he was in Northern
[32:33.160 --> 32:36.200]  California, and nobody else was up there making movies.
[32:36.200 --> 32:43.040]  And that he, he created this amazing franchise that, and, and set up the licensing in such
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.040]  a way that he got all the money from it, so that he would never have to go to the studios
[32:47.040 --> 32:51.040]  for money to make a movie again, he could just make whatever movies he wanted to, and
[32:51.040 --> 32:55.360]  then he made, they used it to make Howard the Duckin Phantom Menace.
[32:55.360 --> 33:00.960]  Yeah, he, I mean, he had no one to answer to other than himself.
[33:00.960 --> 33:05.160]  John, it's watched Howard the Duck at his grandparents' house.
[33:05.160 --> 33:06.160]  Oh my God, really?
[33:06.160 --> 33:07.160]  A couple of months.
[33:07.160 --> 33:08.160]  How did that happen?
[33:08.160 --> 33:09.160]  I don't know.
[33:09.160 --> 33:10.160]  I asked him.
[33:10.160 --> 33:13.960]  It was like, he was there, he was being babysat for the, you know, weekend, being watched
[33:13.960 --> 33:17.000]  for the weekend while Amy and I were away, and I don't know, like, it was on Netflix
[33:17.000 --> 33:22.400]  or something like that, and they're like, well, that's watch that, it's about, and I tried
[33:22.400 --> 33:25.160]  to explain to him that it was from the guy who invented Star Wars, and he wouldn't
[33:25.160 --> 33:26.160]  believe me.
[33:26.160 --> 33:32.520]  So we're a half an hour in, we should probably talk about Apple eventually.
[33:32.520 --> 33:33.520]  Yeah.
[33:33.520 --> 33:35.720]  Hey, financial results came out today.
[33:35.720 --> 33:38.560]  Yeah, they should do.
[33:38.560 --> 33:42.120]  Well today for us, not today for the people of the suckers listening to this later in the
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.360]  week, it's probably not going to come out till Thursday or something.
[33:46.360 --> 33:47.360]  People should listen to this live.
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.120]  I mean, I don't know why they don't.
[33:49.120 --> 33:50.200]  Yeah, should I do that?
[33:50.200 --> 33:54.360]  You know, the ATP guys have that.
[33:54.360 --> 34:01.480]  And it is helpful as I'm listening to ATP, and they either make a mistake or they can't
[34:01.480 --> 34:04.520]  think of something, that they don't have to interrupt themselves and Google it.
[34:04.520 --> 34:09.600]  They just keep their eye on the chat and say, you know, it's kind of amazing.
[34:09.600 --> 34:16.440]  And it sort of reminds me of like the podcast equivalent of like on a live TV, the way
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.800]  the anchor always has earpiece and a director or somebody offstage can tell them things,
[34:21.800 --> 34:28.200]  you know, so that the person who's on air doesn't have to interrupt the show, like
[34:28.200 --> 34:29.200]  it works.
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.320]  And I remember having it with the old talk show at Dan Benjamin for a while, not a long
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.640]  stretch, but for some stretch, we had like an IRC channel or something like that.
[34:38.640 --> 34:41.280]  And it was occasionally helpful.
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.800]  I don't think I could do it though, because I think the reason it works for ATP guys is that
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.880]  they record on a very regular schedule, you know, there's like, I don't know where every Wednesday
[34:49.880 --> 34:54.040]  night at nine each turn they're on and I don't think I've ever recorded two episodes
[34:54.040 --> 34:59.000]  of the show at the same day and time, right?
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.200]  I can, I can vouch for that, like sometimes the ones that I've been on, I'm like, are you
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.200]  up at midnight?
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.400]  Because I'm a, I'm wide awake, it's 3 a.m. Easter, but it's only midnight out there.
[35:09.400 --> 35:10.400]  You're good to go.
[35:10.400 --> 35:18.400]  You're like, you're always like, yeah, remember, do you ever, do you remember being
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.760]  disappointed when I found out that like the tonight show wasn't live?
[35:22.760 --> 35:31.480]  Yeah, although, well, let's see, growing up, I mean, growing up in New York, like Saturday
[35:31.480 --> 35:32.680]  Night Live was live.
[35:32.680 --> 35:33.680]  Yes.
[35:33.680 --> 35:34.680]  Yes.
[35:34.680 --> 35:35.680]  Which was great.
[35:35.680 --> 35:41.320]  That was, that was always crazy and it was always great to see them crack up and stuff
[35:41.320 --> 35:42.320]  like that.
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.480]  Those were always the moments that you remembered, but yeah, but, but that was basically
[35:47.480 --> 35:50.320]  I mean, well, I guess no, they're all like that.
[35:50.320 --> 35:51.320]  Like, whatever it's not live.
[35:51.320 --> 35:52.600]  No, nobody's live anymore.
[35:52.600 --> 35:53.600]  Yeah.
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.560]  The tonight show used to be live and on the east coast.
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.400]  And then I think at some point in the 60s, they switched or maybe it was when they moved
[36:03.400 --> 36:07.240]  to California in the 70s, when they moved from New York to California in the 70s, maybe
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.720]  that's when they switched.
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.960]  And it just felt like a bit of a cheat, right.
[36:15.960 --> 36:20.160]  But then I started thinking of it as more like knowing like a magician's magic trick.
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.200]  Like at first, it ruins the illusion and anything.
[36:22.200 --> 36:23.200]  Hey, this is pretty cool.
[36:23.200 --> 36:24.720]  These people, they're clearly pretended.
[36:24.720 --> 36:25.720]  They don't lie.
[36:25.720 --> 36:27.320]  They don't tell you it's live.
[36:27.320 --> 36:30.320]  But they're acting as though it's late at night somehow.
[36:30.320 --> 36:31.320]  Yeah.
[36:31.320 --> 36:38.640]  But that was, we have going to, I went to a Letterman show once, went back when he was
[36:38.640 --> 36:39.640]  on NBC.
[36:39.640 --> 36:42.480]  And it's like, yeah, it was like at four o'clock in the afternoon or something.
[36:42.480 --> 36:43.640]  Right.
[36:43.640 --> 36:44.640]  Not late night at all.
[36:44.640 --> 36:48.200]  But it'd be, but it's, but they kind of, I mean, they, they tongue in cheek, he does,
[36:48.200 --> 36:51.680]  he does like a tongue in cheek thing attending that it's that it's a night, you know, but
[36:51.680 --> 36:53.720]  he has to stay up until 11 o'clock.
[36:53.720 --> 36:54.720]  Right.
[36:54.720 --> 37:01.120]  Or like, like on election night, he'll make jokes like as though he knows who won the
[37:01.120 --> 37:02.120]  election.
[37:02.120 --> 37:03.120]  Yeah.
[37:03.120 --> 37:13.480]  So financial results came in, is that where we were wrong?
[37:13.480 --> 37:14.480]  That's what we were on.
[37:14.480 --> 37:17.040]  Uh, I hardly really looked that on.
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.360]  It seemed like they were in more or less kind of sort of in line, not shocking.
[37:22.360 --> 37:23.360]  Financially good.
[37:23.360 --> 37:25.560]  iPhone's pretty good.
[37:25.560 --> 37:26.560]  A little bit.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.080]  It's like, I found a little higher than expected.
[37:29.080 --> 37:30.080]  Yeah.
[37:30.080 --> 37:32.720]  Um, margins are still great.
[37:32.720 --> 37:33.880]  Higher than expected.
[37:33.880 --> 37:39.320]  And that was, that's been the thing like that, that during the rundown of the stock,
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.560]  like the, the great 2013 Apple depression was always about the margins, that the margins
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.560]  are going to collapse.
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.440]  They can't, you know, right?
[37:48.440 --> 37:53.880]  And, and part of it was because they'd had a run for a couple of, maybe even over a year
[37:53.880 --> 37:56.120]  where they had insanely high margins.
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.400]  I think maybe, I who knows if it was, how much of it was just, remember when they
[37:59.400 --> 38:06.640]  bought all the, the LCD, LCD screens and a bunch of RAM in advance, uh, it was like somehow
[38:06.640 --> 38:11.960]  like that, that paid off huge and they had like 40 something percent margins for a while.
[38:11.960 --> 38:12.960]  Yeah.
[38:12.960 --> 38:16.520]  And part of it was just that that was a fluke in terms of being high and they kept saying
[38:16.520 --> 38:20.880]  it was a fluke, like, you know, this was all, you know, we'll take the money, but this
[38:20.880 --> 38:21.880]  is a surprise.
[38:21.880 --> 38:24.760]  They're normally that they should not be this high.
[38:24.760 --> 38:28.760]  And then part of it was, you know, just, you know, just bad luck that it, you know, went
[38:28.760 --> 38:29.760]  down a little bit.
[38:29.760 --> 38:32.400]  But then there, I know there was a lot of speculation for a while that the margins were
[38:32.400 --> 38:36.560]  going to compress, I think it's, it's what they say.
[38:36.560 --> 38:38.120]  Yeah.
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.480]  But no.
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.720]  And the only, it's like the only real question is the iPads are down again.
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.720]  Yeah.
[38:46.720 --> 38:47.720]  I've had to down Europe.
[38:47.720 --> 38:51.120]  Well, it's two things I think and I think that maybe they're related.
[38:51.120 --> 38:52.120]  I don't know.
[38:52.120 --> 38:55.160]  iPad is down 10% year over year or nine percent.
[38:55.160 --> 38:56.160]  I guess 20.
[38:56.160 --> 38:57.160]  Oh, really?
[38:57.160 --> 38:58.160]  Well, all right.
[38:58.160 --> 39:05.640]  Well, max are up 18% and the max being up 18% is even more impressive because according
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.440]  to most like IDC and other, you know, people who track the whole industry, the industry
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.680]  as a whole is still down 2% for the same quarter.
[39:14.680 --> 39:20.440]  So in an industry where like Windows PCs or I guess, including the Mac, including all
[39:20.440 --> 39:22.000]  Mac and Windows, you know, who knows?
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.840]  So Windows is, you know, all Windows PCs must be even worse if the Mac is down in the
[39:25.840 --> 39:26.840]  front of it.
[39:26.840 --> 39:27.840]  Right.
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.840]  Right.
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.640]  And I think that's kind of surprising because I feel like a couple of years ago when
[39:32.640 --> 39:40.000]  the iPad was, you know, 2011, 2012 when the iPad was early days and was clearly a hit,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.320]  I think that everybody was, including me was sort of thinking about how, how is this as
[39:45.320 --> 39:50.640]  the iPad gets more powerful and more popular and more familiar, how is that going to affect
[39:50.640 --> 39:52.040]  Mac laptop sales?
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.120]  So it's probably going to, you know, be like a sort of slow decline.
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.720]  And it seems like that's the other way around.
[39:58.720 --> 39:59.720]  I don't know.
[39:59.720 --> 40:00.720]  Yeah.
[40:00.720 --> 40:01.720]  Yeah.
[40:01.720 --> 40:02.720]  It's interesting.
[40:02.720 --> 40:03.720]  I don't know exactly.
[40:03.720 --> 40:11.160]  I mean, I think, well, I think some of the negativity about Windows machine sales is Windows
[40:11.160 --> 40:12.160]  8.
[40:12.160 --> 40:13.160]  Yeah.
[40:13.160 --> 40:18.480]  It's just not, I mean, often those kinds of upgrades drive sales and it's having almost,
[40:18.480 --> 40:21.920]  you know, it's having a negative effect this time because everybody hates it.
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.560]  I really just don't think, if you went back to like 2011 and early days, the tablets
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.800]  and, you know, mobile phones, you know, grown gangbusters, I just don't think I would
[40:30.800 --> 40:34.960]  have believed that come 2014, the Mac would still see a team.
[40:34.960 --> 40:35.960]  Yeah.
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.080]  I never thought that either does my heart well, though, because, you know, it's great
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.480]  to see the Mac doing well.
[40:42.480 --> 40:43.480]  Yeah.
[40:43.480 --> 40:45.080]  I liked that ad.
[40:45.080 --> 40:46.080]  Did you like that?
[40:46.080 --> 40:47.080]  Yeah.
[40:47.080 --> 40:48.080]  Yeah.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.080]  Yeah.
[40:49.080 --> 40:50.080]  And I liked it a lot.
[40:50.080 --> 40:51.080]  Yeah.
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.080]  And I noticed that.
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.680]  I mean, like that, that little flash of the old, I cut the old logos, great.
[40:55.680 --> 40:57.200]  The old logo came up twice.
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.040]  So this is a new commercial that Apple, they call it a short film.
[41:01.040 --> 41:07.280]  It happens to be exactly 30 seconds long, but I don't, you know, you'll see it on TV.
[41:07.280 --> 41:13.120]  They're going to pay money in between to segments of a show in between commercials.
[41:13.120 --> 41:22.840]  They're going to pay to broadcast a 30 second short film about one of their products.
[41:22.840 --> 41:26.400]  But if they're not going to do it, then who is?
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.600]  If you haven't seen it, it's just 30 seconds of almost like stop motion animation, almost.
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.280]  It's just, I don't know if they're a bunch, but it's just a whole bunch of very, very
[41:36.280 --> 41:38.320]  quick cuts.
[41:38.320 --> 41:45.360]  I think it may less than a second each of MacBook, I think mostly MacBook errors, but then
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.200]  it's all Mac, it's all MacBook errors.
[41:47.200 --> 41:49.600]  Oh, I thought at the end they switched to a bigger one.
[41:49.600 --> 41:50.600]  Really?
[41:50.600 --> 41:55.160]  Because I thought that the whole, the whole ad was about, was about the year, because it's
[41:55.160 --> 41:57.160]  like, then it's a MacBook, everybody's favorite.
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.680]  Maybe it's two different sizes of MacBook errors, but with, you know, all sorts of custom
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.800]  stickers decorating the, the outer Apple logo case.
[42:07.800 --> 42:08.880]  They never show the screen.
[42:08.880 --> 42:12.360]  It's always just the Apple logo.
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.680]  Some of them I've seen before, some of them pretty clever, but then why notice the one about
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.680]  halfway through it's, it's like a pixel art version of the old six color Apple logo that
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.800]  you put over the Apple logo on the MacBook, and then when the, when the Apple logo lights
[42:28.800 --> 42:31.880]  up, it lights up the decal.
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.160]  I saw that one at first, and I thought, oh, cool, I haven't seen, you know, that's a neat
[42:36.160 --> 42:38.480]  way to sneak the old Apple logo into an ad.
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.480]  But then at the very end of the ad, very quickly cycle through different styles of the
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.360]  Apple logo, not on a MacBook, just the Apple logo, including the old six color Apple logo.
[42:49.360 --> 42:51.600]  And I found that really interesting.
[42:51.600 --> 42:52.600]  Yeah.
[42:52.600 --> 42:55.560]  When pushed back, I wrote about it and I said something, what did I say?
[42:55.560 --> 43:01.120]  It said it pretty well, so I should probably just rip, rip myself off.
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.960]  I wrote, people have been decorating their laptops with stickers and decals ever since
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.000]  they became consumer products.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.960]  You didn't see many stickers on them when they cost $5,000.
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.640]  I think, but first time I tried to buy a power book, it was $6,000 and I was like, wow,
[43:14.640 --> 43:17.600]  that isn't going to happen.
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.040]  And I don't think we need to commission a demographic survey to state that younger people
[43:22.040 --> 43:23.920]  are more likely to do this than older people.
[43:23.920 --> 43:29.800]  It's no coincidence that the spot is debuting in back to school season.
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.160]  And the old days, Apple didn't have to worry about conformance.
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.440]  Just owning a Mac made you stand out from the crowd.
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.600]  But what happens now when everyone you know has a MacBook and every MacBook looks the
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.560]  same, something like this commercial is what happens.
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.560]  Some people push back onto it like everybody you know has a MacBook and it's like, I'm
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.320]  obviously, you can something like that doesn't literally mean everybody.
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.360]  But I'll bet it's the case in a lot of schools that there are, you know, whether it's
[43:58.360 --> 44:03.560]  high school or college where it seems like everybody you know has a MacBook.
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.520]  I don't know, I've seen those pictures, you see those pictures like lecture halls.
[44:07.520 --> 44:08.520]  Yeah.
[44:08.520 --> 44:14.080]  I mean, that's been happening for years before these market changes happened in the PC market
[44:14.080 --> 44:17.840]  where PCs started falling in Mac started rising.
[44:17.840 --> 44:18.840]  Yeah.
[44:18.840 --> 44:26.840]  And I think that among like younger teenagers and college students, it's even more profound.
[44:26.840 --> 44:30.000]  So yeah, take every word everyone with a grain of salt.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.400]  But if it seems like most of your friends all have MacBooks, all MacBooks, especially
[44:35.400 --> 44:40.720]  from the back look exactly the same, you know, the air, the pro, they're all just aluminum
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.720]  with a white logo.
[44:41.720 --> 44:48.760]  I mean, I think it's a cool look, but you know, as a kid, that's there's a sort of resistance
[44:48.760 --> 44:51.600]  to that sort of conformance.
[44:51.600 --> 44:52.600]  Yeah.
[44:52.600 --> 44:56.320]  I'm not a fan of the plastic covers.
[44:56.320 --> 44:57.320]  What plastic covers?
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.920]  Every once in a while I'll put a cover on my iPhone, but I just because I feel like I'm
[45:00.920 --> 45:01.920]  going to drop that.
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.920]  But I don't, on a MacBook, I don't, I don't like the plastic.
[45:06.920 --> 45:07.920]  Yeah.
[45:07.920 --> 45:08.920]  And I don't think you need to detect this.
[45:08.920 --> 45:10.920]  Well, the other thing is shells.
[45:10.920 --> 45:14.600]  Yeah, the other thing that's interesting about that commercial is it shows a bunch of them
[45:14.600 --> 45:21.440]  that are beaten up, that literally dented, scratched, well used.
[45:21.440 --> 45:23.200]  And that's pretty interesting because it's of my knowledge.
[45:23.200 --> 45:24.920]  I think Matthew Penzer, you don't point to this out.
[45:24.920 --> 45:31.520]  I don't think Apple's ever advertised with, you know, well worn versions of their machine.
[45:31.520 --> 45:33.680]  No, no, no.
[45:33.680 --> 45:37.720]  But they've talked about it before, like Johnny Ive at least has in those, you know, those
[45:37.720 --> 45:43.640]  videos he shoots from the, the weird white universe he lives in.
[45:43.640 --> 45:51.400]  You know, it's like where that guy who runs the matrix is, run the matrix, sure.
[45:51.400 --> 45:56.120]  You know, that, that they choose these materials for how they wear, you know, and that it
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.400]  should be like a pair, you know, good, good old pair of boots or blue jeans or something
[46:00.400 --> 46:03.600]  like that, you know, that it should look better as it ages.
[46:03.600 --> 46:05.760]  But they don't show it like that.
[46:05.760 --> 46:09.320]  But I do think there's a truth to it, you know, and I think that especially, you know,
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.200]  a phone is different because it's got glass and can, you know, that's the glass, all
[46:13.200 --> 46:14.200]  things are off with that.
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.560]  I don't use a case for my phone, but I don't blame anybody it does because glass.
[46:18.560 --> 46:24.840]  Whereas, you know, MacBooks are, in my experience, extremely rugged, yeah, especially,
[46:24.840 --> 46:31.080]  especially since they've switched to SSDs, yeah.
[46:31.080 --> 46:34.720]  I think that, you know, and the aluminum, you know, I think that it's kind of neat.
[46:34.720 --> 46:36.680]  I think Johnny, I've probably liked that ad.
[46:36.680 --> 46:41.840]  I think he'd like probably seeing him beat up and worn in an ad because I do think
[46:41.840 --> 46:43.280]  they had designed for that.
[46:43.280 --> 46:44.280]  Yeah.
[46:44.280 --> 46:46.280]  Is your kid up a MacBook?
[46:46.280 --> 46:48.880]  He uses a very old MacBook Air.
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.960]  Yeah, he's, he's got my old MacBook Pro and man, he's, he's rough on that thing.
[46:53.960 --> 46:59.760]  Like physically rough or like rough like everything.
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.640]  I mean, it's, you know, and, and, and he's, he's like, he spilled a drink on the keyboard
[47:04.640 --> 47:07.640]  and, and now I got to figure out how to get the keys off to clean because it's, they're
[47:07.640 --> 47:08.640]  sticky now.
[47:08.640 --> 47:12.840]  Well, we like underneath their sticky, the clean, you know, it's easy to clean the top
[47:12.840 --> 47:13.840]  of them.
[47:13.840 --> 47:20.440]  But now they're like, they, they, the touch that I would not type on that thing.
[47:20.440 --> 47:26.120]  Uh, John, John says a bit of a passive aggressive streak to him where he's taken now to
[47:26.120 --> 47:33.240]  showing me some, um, Minecraft mods, there's, there's, there's, they're called shaders
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.120]  and they, they totally changed the way the game is rendered.
[47:37.120 --> 47:43.240]  And, uh, and he says, look, this one is meant for, uh, MacBook, old MacBook Airs to
[47:43.240 --> 47:45.720]  make it look better and it's still laggy.
[47:45.720 --> 47:48.480]  Wow, isn't that interesting?
[47:48.480 --> 47:51.120]  And then, you know, and then he's like, but this one's actually all right, even though
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.280]  it wasn't meant for an old MacBook.
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.640]  But this one's, it, well, and he goes, well, it's laggy, but it's not as laggy.
[47:59.640 --> 48:06.840]  And I do kind of feel bad, but in the sense that somehow I'm proud that he, you know, cares
[48:06.840 --> 48:09.520]  about frame rate and right, right.
[48:09.520 --> 48:10.880]  No, I get that, I get that too.
[48:10.880 --> 48:11.880]  Right.
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.480]  Like we have got a great running gag in our house where like, because it's, well here's,
[48:15.480 --> 48:16.480]  you guys are three too.
[48:16.480 --> 48:19.000]  So it's, there's never a tie.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  Somebody's always going to win.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.680]  And so like one of ours is, um, standard deaf video on the TV.
[48:25.680 --> 48:30.360]  Amy doesn't really notice, doesn't really seem to care Jonas, Jonas acts as though he's
[48:30.360 --> 48:38.960]  been poisoned, like a spit take, like you expect me to watch this.
[48:38.960 --> 48:42.600]  I don't think he can't notice is the video quality that much.
[48:42.600 --> 48:47.960]  Maybe that's because he's not wearing his glasses, but, um, but he definitely like frame
[48:47.960 --> 48:50.960]  rates or buffering it, drive him, berserk.
[48:50.960 --> 48:57.960]  Oh, my God, you got to help you if something is buffering on like Netflix or something.
[48:57.960 --> 49:03.240]  All right, anything drops below 60 when we get a move to another country where they have
[49:03.240 --> 49:04.760]  got her 60 frames per second.
[49:04.760 --> 49:10.960]  It's like when I was a kid, we had eight pixels on the screen at a black and white TV.
[49:10.960 --> 49:17.840]  My art, our Atari 2600 literally had a switch you can flip that said you're playing
[49:17.840 --> 49:19.840]  on a black and white TV.
[49:19.840 --> 49:20.840]  Remember that?
[49:20.840 --> 49:21.840]  It was a switch.
[49:21.840 --> 49:22.840]  It was like BMW.
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.840]  And it was like, I guess it somehow would, you know, only choose shades, right, you know,
[49:28.840 --> 49:29.840]  right.
[49:29.840 --> 49:31.840]  Things that would make it.
[49:31.840 --> 49:38.840]  My first video game console had a mode for black and white TVs.
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.960]  Anything else on the quarterly finances, uh, just that they are looking forward to having
[49:44.960 --> 49:45.960]  a big fall.
[49:45.960 --> 49:46.960]  Oh, is that what they said?
[49:46.960 --> 49:47.960]  I didn't see that.
[49:47.960 --> 49:48.960]  Yeah.
[49:48.960 --> 49:55.000]  We're recording at a time where I have not seen the, uh, the conference call, which is
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.080]  usually where more information comes out.
[49:57.080 --> 49:59.960]  So they've dropped a hint that they expect to have a big fall.
[49:59.960 --> 50:00.960]  Yes.
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.160]  Oh, and the other, the other thing, which, you know, we've been hoping for and kind
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.480]  of expecting to.
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.840]  And then the other thing I thought was interesting was that Tim Cook said that the growth
[50:11.840 --> 50:16.720]  in the iPhone five, see, you know, they don't give out, they don't break out how well each
[50:16.720 --> 50:18.600]  iPhone does.
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.520]  But he said the growth this quarter and the iPhone five C tier was higher than the growth
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.840]  in either the four S or the five S tier.
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.840]  Hmm.
[50:28.840 --> 50:29.840]  So right.
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.400]  In other words, not, you know, obviously there's no, there was no previous four C to
[50:34.400 --> 50:37.440]  compare against, but it was that the pricing tiers.
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.440]  Yes.
[50:38.440 --> 50:39.440]  Yeah.
[50:39.440 --> 50:44.440]  It was compared to the four S a year ago, I guess compared to the four S a year ago, correct?
[50:44.440 --> 50:45.440]  Right.
[50:45.440 --> 50:46.440]  Yeah.
[50:46.440 --> 50:47.440]  Yeah.
[50:47.440 --> 50:48.440]  Yeah.
[50:48.440 --> 50:48.920]  I think that's interesting, especially since there were a lot of people who were sort of
[50:48.920 --> 50:54.240]  chalk in the five C up as a failure, as somehow that it was that it was, that's the
[50:54.240 --> 50:55.240]  yeah.
[50:55.240 --> 50:59.280]  And, and it's only, you know, it's a in arguably a failure in that they don't think they
[50:59.280 --> 51:03.400]  didn't sell as many as Apple thought they were going to sell or maybe they didn't sell
[51:03.400 --> 51:07.080]  them as many as they thought they would in the first quarter, but maybe for the year
[51:07.080 --> 51:08.080]  as a whole.
[51:08.080 --> 51:09.080]  Yeah.
[51:09.080 --> 51:10.080]  Right.
[51:10.080 --> 51:11.080]  I guess it's only been nine months or so.
[51:11.080 --> 51:14.840]  And it's still like it's like the fourth or fifth best selling phone.
[51:14.840 --> 51:16.440]  I, I see a lot of them.
[51:16.440 --> 51:17.440]  I really do.
[51:17.440 --> 51:18.440]  I started.
[51:18.440 --> 51:19.440]  Yeah.
[51:19.440 --> 51:20.440]  It keeps me more and more.
[51:20.440 --> 51:26.280]  Um, yeah, I think, you know, I don't think Apple, I know from talking to some people that
[51:26.280 --> 51:29.040]  Apple that they don't, they don't, they don't have a crystal ball.
[51:29.040 --> 51:32.400]  They don't, they didn't know exactly how many, like talking to them last year when
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.000]  they first announced them.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.880]  And to me, the part that stuck out right on day one was that I think it was at a hundred
[51:38.880 --> 51:43.040]  and ninety nine or was it two hundred and ninety nine, there was one price where you could
[51:43.040 --> 51:48.600]  for the exact same price, carry or subsidize you could get either the five S or the five C.
[51:48.600 --> 51:54.520]  You could get like the best five C or the worst five S at, I think, I don't know if it was
[51:54.520 --> 51:55.520]  one ninety nine or nine.
[51:55.520 --> 51:58.280]  Different just different amounts of memory.
[51:58.280 --> 51:59.280]  Yes.
[51:59.280 --> 52:00.280]  Yeah.
[52:00.280 --> 52:05.600]  I, you know, and, you know, the five S has, yeah, it was, it was like the 16 gigabyte five
[52:05.600 --> 52:09.640]  S versus the 32 gigabyte five C doesn't matter.
[52:09.640 --> 52:13.440]  I could be wrong and I don't even email me, but, you know, like something like that,
[52:13.440 --> 52:18.800]  you get a 32 gigabyte five C or 16 gigabyte five S at the exact same price.
[52:18.800 --> 52:23.200]  And I thought that was interesting because that's, it's like, for some people who
[52:23.200 --> 52:27.280]  someone who's less informed, you know, maybe that's a difficult decision.
[52:27.280 --> 52:29.360]  And how did they think that was going to break out?
[52:29.360 --> 52:32.760]  And they're like, we don't know, you know, we, you know, we really don't know.
[52:32.760 --> 52:36.680]  We have some estimates, but, you know, until we put the stuff out, you know, we're always
[52:36.680 --> 52:44.120]  a little surprised by which, which, you know, exact configuration sell better than others.
[52:44.120 --> 52:47.400]  You know, there's some consistency year over year, but sometimes, you know, you can't predict
[52:47.400 --> 52:48.400]  it.
[52:48.400 --> 52:53.560]  So I think there are probably a little surprise that the five C didn't sell great right
[52:53.560 --> 52:58.280]  off the bat and maybe they're a little surprised that it has legs as strong as it does.
[52:58.280 --> 53:03.320]  And I think, you know, there's a, there's an easy explanation, you know, that it, the one
[53:03.320 --> 53:09.000]  that people who are enthusiasts are going to buy is always going to be the top of the line.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  Brand, you know, the real new one, right, that you care about things like that the camera
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.600]  is a little better and has, you know, an extra half stop of exposure.
[53:17.600 --> 53:23.440]  And you care about the fact that the A7 is a faster, you know, CPU, I mean, every day,
[53:23.440 --> 53:27.280]  my life is better every day because my phone runs 64 bit.
[53:27.280 --> 53:33.200]  I can't believe there's people out there running in 32 bit cell phone.
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.920]  If I had a 32 bit cell phone, I probably couldn't read my phone with either I.
[53:36.920 --> 53:37.920]  I just kill myself.
[53:37.920 --> 53:38.920]  That's right.
[53:38.920 --> 53:41.800]  That's what I would do.
[53:41.800 --> 53:42.800]  But no, you know what I mean?
[53:42.800 --> 53:44.200]  We think about things like that.
[53:44.200 --> 53:48.760]  And then we do stupid things like go get in line on day one to buy one so that we can
[53:48.760 --> 53:51.520]  have it the first day that it comes out.
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.200]  Whereas people who are not like that, like just buy a phone whenever the old one breaks
[53:57.200 --> 54:00.760]  or whenever they feel like the old one, man, I'm sick of this old phone, I got to get
[54:00.760 --> 54:01.760]  a new phone.
[54:01.760 --> 54:05.560]  And then they go in and they're like, wow, I like that pink one.
[54:05.560 --> 54:06.560]  That looks cool.
[54:06.560 --> 54:08.480]  I'm going to get that one.
[54:08.480 --> 54:11.760]  And they don't care about the fact that the, you know, camera is one year old.
[54:11.760 --> 54:12.760]  Yeah.
[54:12.760 --> 54:16.240]  And so of course it makes sense that that's the one that I think in hindsight, it
[54:16.240 --> 54:22.000]  don't now is to make sense that that's the one that would do better year over year.
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.400]  Like us more of a slow burn.
[54:24.400 --> 54:25.400]  Right.
[54:25.400 --> 54:26.560]  And it still looks new.
[54:26.560 --> 54:27.960]  It looks like a new phone.
[54:27.960 --> 54:31.520]  Whereas like a year ago, if you were going to buy the mid-tier phone, you were getting
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.360]  a 4S and it kind of looked a little older and you know, just, you know, kind of looked
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.200]  like a year old phone compared to the 5S.
[54:40.200 --> 54:45.440]  Whereas the 5C looks just as new, just, you know, a different style.
[54:45.440 --> 54:48.280]  There was another, there was a rumor about, did you see this?
[54:48.280 --> 54:58.160]  I can't, was it the Wall Street Journal that Apple was ordering 60 to 80 million big phones?
[54:58.160 --> 54:59.960]  Oh, I saw something about this.
[54:59.960 --> 55:00.960]  Right.
[55:00.960 --> 55:03.200]  And some huge number of, right.
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.000]  Whereas like phones for the, you know, like, I think like last year in the fall, they sold
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.080]  like 50 million.
[55:09.080 --> 55:12.000]  And so like, something like 80 is like a huge spike.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Yeah.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  I saw some stuff on Twitter about that.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.040]  Where it's like one rogue report that they're ordering 80 million iPhones now means that,
[55:21.040 --> 55:23.800]  you know, six months from now, and they report the holiday quarter.
[55:23.800 --> 55:26.760]  It spills some cell 75 and this is just a woman.
[55:26.760 --> 55:27.760]  Yeah.
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.080]  Anything less than that is going to be a huge mess.
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.520]  No matter how much higher it is than what it actually was a year ago.
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.520]  Let's, well, hold that thought.
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.840]  Let's, I'm going to do a sponsorship and I want to hold that thought on bigger iPhones.

[56:51.360 --> 56:52.520]  You'll see how much you like it.
[56:52.520 --> 56:54.040]  You'll see how much you've learned.
[56:54.040 --> 56:59.280]  And then for one low monthly price, if you want to become a regular customer, 25 bucks,
[56:59.280 --> 57:05.720]  25 bucks a month, and you get unlimited access every month, the entire library at linda.com,
[57:05.720 --> 57:09.920]  including the new stuff that they put out on a continuous basis.
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.160]  And the thing is, this is so unlike anything that you get on YouTube or who knows what
[57:15.160 --> 57:20.680]  the quality is, everything on linda.com is really high production values, really high quality
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.680]  and great teachers, the type of people who you want to be learning from, real pros, not
[57:25.680 --> 57:32.200]  just some idiot with a webcam, real pros, great production values, and new stuff coming
[57:32.200 --> 57:33.200]  out all the time.
[57:33.200 --> 57:38.640]  It's amazing, whenever I check in and see what they've got, just how everything like,
[57:38.640 --> 57:45.480]  new versions of the Adobe CS suite come out and new linda.com courses on them come out
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.480]  immediately.
[57:46.480 --> 57:50.400]  It's amazing.
[57:50.400 --> 57:54.720]  Can't emphasize enough, just how great the quality is, and the deal, it sounds too good
[57:54.720 --> 57:55.720]  to be true.
[57:55.720 --> 57:59.680]  You go there for seven days, free trial, watch all you can eat.
[57:59.680 --> 58:02.400]  That's how confident they are that if you try it.
[58:02.400 --> 58:06.400]  You go there for seven, try the seven day thing and start watching it.
[58:06.400 --> 58:10.560]  That's how confident linda.com is that you're going to cough up the dough to sign up
[58:10.560 --> 58:12.160]  for a subscription.
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.880]  Here's where you go to find out more and get the seven days and let them know you're
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.000]  coming from this show.
[58:18.000 --> 58:28.040]  Go to linda.com with a Y slash V talk show with the the linda.com slash the talk show.
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.000]  You get seven days free trial.
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.000]  My thanks to them.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.600]  All right, big iPhone.
[58:33.600 --> 58:40.320]  I might be a week or two behind, but on the ATP, Syracuse brought up.
[58:40.320 --> 58:43.840]  I thought a great question and I was like, how come nobody's talking about this?
[58:43.840 --> 58:47.600]  They're talking about, you know, this pervasive rumors that there's going to be two big
[58:47.600 --> 58:52.440]  our iPhones, 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch.
[58:52.440 --> 58:59.960]  How come if there's going to be a 5.5 inch iPhone, that where are the component leaks?
[58:59.960 --> 59:05.000]  Because there's all sorts of component leaks purported at least for the 4.7 and they're
[59:05.000 --> 59:11.680]  from people who've had like a year ago when they had component leaks of things like the
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.440]  gold back of the 5S, you know, we're pretty much spot on.
[59:17.440 --> 59:24.800]  But there's no and there's sort of, you know, the 4, the 4.7 inch new iPhone is seems to
[59:24.800 --> 59:32.120]  be tracking exactly on pace, leak wise, as the last two or three years of iPhones, which
[59:32.120 --> 59:37.400]  to me it makes it seem like a slam dunk like unless something, you know, goes wrong or
[59:37.400 --> 59:42.680]  it's, you know, it seems like that's going to be a new product soon.
[59:42.680 --> 59:43.680]  But there's nothing.
[59:43.680 --> 59:44.680]  I haven't seen anything.
[59:44.680 --> 59:47.440]  There's, you know, like there've been screens that have come out for the 4.7.
[59:47.440 --> 59:51.080]  There've been cases, nothing for the 5.5.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.560]  And then like Reuters had a story last week.
[59:52.560 --> 59:53.560]  I think it was Reuters.
[59:53.560 --> 1:00:00.880]  Business week, but one of them had a story that said that the 4.7 inch iPhone 6 is going
[1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:06.280]  into production now, like meaning July, and that the 5.5 inch one is going into production
[1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.920]  next month, meaning August.
[1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:15.720]  But see, you might think, well, if it's a month behind then, you know, maybe the leaks
[1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:19.240]  are going to start coming soon, but the leaks for the 4.7 inch phone came more than
[1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:20.240]  a month ago.
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:21.240]  It started a long time.
[1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:24.000]  They started months, plural ago.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.520]  I mean, of course, it makes sense that they would pick up if it is, you know, entering
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:29.520]  production.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:30.520]  But I don't know.
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:35.400]  There's something about this 5.5 inch thing that to me is starting to sound like it isn't
[1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:36.400]  going to happen.
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.320]  And it seems kind of crazy to think that they would have phones and three sizes.
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:41.320]  I don't know.
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:50.000]  It just, that seems to just, I've said it before on numerous times, it seems like it's
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.320]  going to introduce two at the same time seems very odd.
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.360]  Yeah, it seems like it would make Phil Schiller's head explode, like from a marketing
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:02.960]  perspective, how do you frame it, you know, how do you frame the story, like, like with
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:09.720]  the iPads, they've got the same specs, same camera, same, you know, CPU, same pixel dimensions.
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:13.080]  It's just you want one bigger or smaller, and you have to pay, you know, extra hundred
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:16.640]  bucks or a hundred twenty nine bucks or whatever the difference is for the bigger one.
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.760]  And somehow seems to make sense in consumer minds that you pay a little more to get a bigger
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:24.720]  one, pay a little less to get a smaller one, or maybe it doesn't, maybe that's why iPad
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:25.720]  sales are down.
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:26.720]  I don't know.
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:31.520]  But, but it somehow comes across its feeling fair, whereas if they come out with two new
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:38.240]  iPhone sixes and they're like the same A8 system on a chip, the same new and improved
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:44.520]  camera, the same thinness and one cost more than the other, well, which one cost more?
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:46.440]  I'd rather have the smaller one.
[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:51.880]  So what I, right, it doesn't seem to me like you said, pay more for a bigger one.
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:54.920]  So I don't, it doesn't make any sense to me, but maybe maybe we're in luck, maybe
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:58.680]  this will be the year where I don't want to buy the most expensive, I mean, it, particularly
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:05.640]  because they've approached this so slowly and carefully to date, yeah, jumping up to 5.5 inches
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.040]  seems unnecessary.
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:10.040]  And they're still, they're still growing sales.
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.400]  I mean, it's not like, you know, if it was the iPad, maybe it didn't, we might think,
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:20.520]  okay, well, sales are falling, maybe they need to do something else, but, you know, it's
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:24.120]  not like, it's not like they have a problem, big problem selling iPhones.
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:30.360]  Yeah, these four inch iPhones are only selling in record numbers.
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:34.520]  And conversely, I don't think it makes any sense product marketing wise for, if there's
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:40.600]  two for one to be like an A tier and one to be the B tier, because there's some number
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:48.360]  of people who are going to want the other one, but want the other specs, right?
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.400]  Somebody is going to say, I want to top of the line iPhone.
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:57.000]  And if the top of the line one is the 5.5 inch and the mid tier one is 4.7 inch, like
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:02.640]  the 5C equivalent class, spec wise, well, I'm going to be upset, because I don't want
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:07.480]  a 5.5 inch iPhone, even though I'm spent half an hour being a show talking about how
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:11.440]  I can't read my iPhone.
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:12.360]  I don't want it.
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:19.040]  I don't, I've rather not be able to read my phone than carry something that big.
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:20.040]  I don't get it.
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:21.240]  I don't see how they could do it, you know?
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:25.360]  And then if, you know, like, let's say that the 5.5 inch one has a better camera than
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:30.480]  a 4.7 inch one, well, that, I mean, that's going to make me angry, right?
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:31.720]  I just don't see it.
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:34.400]  It doesn't make any, it's never made any sense to me.
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:40.880]  Like the iPhone, I don't know, I'll wait and then, and then do they sell four phones
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:45.760]  or do they sell, or does the, yes, this doesn't make any sense.
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:52.400]  If they switch to a thing where the new iPhone 6 is out and it has, now it has a 4.7 inch
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:55.400]  screen, I don't, that doesn't sound good to me.
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:59.520]  I like four inches, but I'll try it and it does sound reasonable and it just maybe, you
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:03.600]  know, as batteries get bigger, you know, you know, maybe I'd be happy with it and I'll
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.320]  think, you know what, I kind of like having a bigger phone and, you know, you know, like
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:13.280]  I said, my eyes are getting worse, maybe maybe, I mean, when the, when the five came
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:16.720]  out, it was physically smaller than the four S.
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  Right.
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:21.440]  It was a large screen, but in terms of volume, it was actually a smaller phone.
[1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:22.440]  Right.
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.440]  And so I would hope they would do something like that again.
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:26.920]  Yeah, it felt like a fair trade off.
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:27.920]  Yeah.
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:33.080]  Whereas going to 5.5 is just ridiculous, although I'm not saying no that I, I can't believe
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.520]  that other people would want a device like that.
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:40.080]  I do, I totally understand that some people love them and that they, you know, that there
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:44.120]  is like a, it's like a sweet spot between, you know, I don't need a tablet and a phone.
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:45.360]  I just have this one device.
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:47.520]  It's, it's, I know it's not for me.
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.240]  I've seen such similar devices.
[1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:53.760]  I can't imagine carrying them around, carrying it around my pocket everywhere I go.
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.560]  So I just don't see it.
[1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:59.880]  I also don't, I do think that also though, and with the discussions note, you know, joking
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:06.480]  aside about, you know, my, my press biopia, it does raise the question, no, of what is the
[1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:08.520]  point of getting a bigger screen?
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:14.680]  Is it to make everything bigger so that you see the same amount of text, but now it's bigger?
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:19.440]  Or is it to put more on the screen and keep the text the same size and now that you can
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:21.880]  have more text at the same time?
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:22.880]  Yeah.
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.640]  I think the answer is maybe both little bit of both right with the settings, you know, like
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:31.840]  with the, what do they call it?
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:33.680]  Oh, so you get one or the other?
[1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:37.960]  They don't call it adaptive text, but there's, you know, with iOS 7, they introduce the
[1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:45.040]  thing where you go into general text size and you can make text bigger system wide.
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:50.400]  And maybe, you know, it always seems to me like when you make a bigger on the current
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:52.880]  iPhone, it just takes up too much space.
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:58.640]  Maybe with a 5.5 inch phone that it would be a great option for people with a failing
[1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.640]  eyesight.
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:02.920]  I could see that as a great product, but I just, I still don't see how they sell it
[1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:09.080]  alongside the 4.7 inch, at least at the same year.
[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:10.480]  It just seems like a lot to sell.
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:11.480]  Yeah.
[1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:12.480]  I don't know.
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:16.400]  To me, I'm, the leaks, even though there are leaks coming out, I feel like we know less
[1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:22.240]  about what they're going to announce iPhone-wise than in years, many years.
[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:25.600]  I can't even remember the last time that we, that I've had so many questions.
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:29.920]  Yeah, because last year, about this time we had, oh, well, I don't know if it was quite
[1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:30.920]  this time.
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:35.720]  Certainly by August, we had seen the 5C.
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:37.840]  I had already written my review.
[1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:41.640]  No, no, we didn't see the 5C, did we?
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:43.280]  No, we, I thought we saw the shells.
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:46.160]  Oh, I thought we only saw the 5S, the metal ones.
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:47.520]  I didn't think we saw the plastic ones.
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.240]  Oh, no, maybe we did, they were white.
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:52.800]  It may, yeah, I think they were white, yeah, but we didn't see all the colors, I don't
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:53.800]  think.
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:55.760]  I think we just saw like a white plastic one.
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:06:58.680]  Yeah, I do remember something like that.
[1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:00.480]  So we're, we're in agreement.
[1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:03.800]  No, 5, 5.5, yeah, anyway.
[1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:04.800]  I don't know.
[1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:08.840]  And then there's people, the people saying, the rumors saying that it's a month behind
[1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:14.240]  or that it might come early next year, why, they wouldn't announce that in September
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:15.240]  then.
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  That seems weird that they would do that.
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:21.440]  Like, if it's three or four months behind, that seems to me like, that's a non-starter.
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:29.200]  Like, it should either be at the same time and therefore in time for the holidays or
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:33.000]  like six months later, you could, you know, maybe do it in April or something like that,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.800]  like when they announced the first couple of moments.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:36.800]  Yeah.
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:41.080]  But if, you know, the holidays, it's such a weird blip on their quarter.
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:43.920]  I mean, you can see it every time they have these, you know, like today, every time they
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:45.560]  do the quarterly finance announcements.
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.000]  It's such a weird blip.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:53.560]  There's such a holiday, heavily company that it doesn't make sense that they would have
[1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:57.400]  something that would debut in, I don't know, January or something like that.
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:01.320]  And they can't announce it in September because then people would, you know, it's the
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:05.920]  whole Osborne effect thing, like they're not going to want to buy the 4.7 inch one until
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:10.720]  they can see the 5.5 inch one and make a side-by-side comparison.
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:14.480]  Or, you know, they can't just have five point, you know, we're not going to sell it until
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:17.520]  January, but we'll put them in the stores so you can see them.
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:22.240]  Well, then if people love them, that, you know, what, they're going to, did they wait?
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:25.560]  It doesn't make any sense, you know, you don't show people something unless you can
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:26.560]  sell it to them.
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:27.560]  Yeah.
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:28.560]  I just don't get it.
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:29.560]  Something just doesn't, doesn't.
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:36.720]  Some of those rumors came from Ming-Chi Kuo, I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong, who is held
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:45.560]  up as, like, one of the really good rumor, you know, rumor sources and used to work for
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:49.280]  Digitimes and now works, now works for KGI securities.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.920]  We know everybody, I don't even know if it's a he or she, but it's a he.
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:54.920]  All right.
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:59.920]  If he got fired from Digitimes for his poor track record.
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:03.160]  And he's, and he's been, you know, he's gotten a number of things correct, but he's also
[1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:05.960]  gotten a number of things completely incorrect because last year he said that the
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:09.080]  iPhone was, was going to be announced at, at WWDC.
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.080]  Right.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:15.200]  And, and he's the one saying that the, the, the iPhone's delayed, you know, the big
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:20.440]  iPhones are delayed and won't be, won't be coming, it might not come until next year.
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:25.760]  I think that if the 5.5 inch iPhone is, quote, is delayed, maybe they were working on it,
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:28.760]  maybe it is delayed for whatever reason.
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.880]  That means it's pushed back a year.
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  That's what I think.
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:34.040]  Yeah, I would, I would think so too.
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:38.200]  Right, they are not going to do something like the three, two, three months after the initial
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:39.200]  one.
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.360]  So here's the thing, here's what I can't wait for then.
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:45.460]  Imagine this scenario, September comes, there's a big iPhone event that your Buena
[1:09:45.460 --> 1:09:47.160]  centers rented out.
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:51.280]  They put up some kind of big colorful poster.
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:57.960]  I fly out there where they have a big show, dog and show, dog and pony show.
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:04.800]  And the only new iPhone they announced is a 4.7 inch iPhone 6.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:07.760]  It doesn't matter how awesome that phone is.
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.040]  How many people are going to say, where's my 5.5 inch iPhone?
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:13.040]  Right?
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:21.080]  I mean, that's, it's like the can't win situation that Apple is in, like it, if they,
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:25.320]  I, I don't see how they could do this, it still doesn't make sense to me how they would
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:26.320]  do both.
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:30.320]  There's going to be some number of people who are outraged and are going to say that
[1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:37.400]  they are out of touch, they're, you know, going to disappear in 60 days, if they don't
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.480]  get a 5.5 inch phone out.
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:46.080]  Did they, did they disappear after that, that 60 days?
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:48.840]  I wanted to know someone would ask on the conference call.
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:50.880]  Are you still in business?
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  I'm guessing.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:56.440]  I guess he tripped, tripped Choudry does not get on the conference call because they would
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.280]  get great if it's not good to answer.
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:00.760]  That's why I'm like, can we take starter that?
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:08.800]  I, I would totally kick starter project to get tripped Choudry onto the every conference
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:09.800]  call.
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:14.280]  And at least for the next four, you know, we'll pay whatever it costs and we'll get
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:18.040]  tripped Choudry on every, he gets one question on every call.
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:22.640]  He just take Gene Munster's spot, right?
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.760]  Munster's is going to ask about Apple TV.
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:27.880]  He's going to ask you guys, you know, he's going to burn a question on the Apple TV.
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:28.880]  Yeah.
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:31.720]  Let's give one to tripped Choudry.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:32.720]  Tim Chiptry here.
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:33.720]  Are you still in business?
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.280]  Are you still in business?
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:40.760]  I've got your pencil done for disappearing in early June when you didn't release an eye
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:42.080]  watch thing.
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:44.240]  Oh, that guy.
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  This is Tim.
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.320]  I don't do impressions.
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:49.600]  This is my, this is my Tim Cooks other accent.
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:52.360]  I'm going to take that question.
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:54.640]  Now we're still here.
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:09.600]  So I see next quarter, yeah, I don't know check it at 90 days, hopefully we can keep the
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:17.080]  lights on the other one other thing from the that I heard on the
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:22.440]  like a little bit of the conference call that I heard before we got on the air was that
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:25.920]  well, the iPad sales were down.
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:32.920]  Overall, they were up about 50% in countries like China and India, which was interesting
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:40.560]  and they were down in the the mature countries, developed nations where they call them
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:41.560]  brick countries.
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:50.800]  Yeah, I see now what what is that Brazil, Russia, India, China, Brazil, Russia, India, China
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:56.640]  sounds it sounds like like four random countries, which is yeah, although they're except
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:06.760]  that they're both all four are enormously populous, right, right, yeah.
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:11.480]  So those, those four countries, it's way up and isn't that exactly the, the, those
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:16.240]  are exactly the sort of countries where I feel like everybody said they would, would
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.760]  never, would never sell any iPads.
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:25.240]  Well, and that they also are like the sort of countries where everybody was saying last
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:30.480]  year when the five C came out and wasn't cheap, you know, that everybody's saying,
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:34.000]  oh, they're going to make a cheap iPhone and they came out and it wasn't it was, you
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.360]  know, they had nothing to do with the cost, it had to do with having the mid tier occupied
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:45.400]  by a new device at the same price points instead of a year old device coming down.
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:46.400]  That's all they did.
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.720]  Had nothing to do with the price, it was about replacing the middle tier with a new phone
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:56.400]  rather than one that was probably cheaper to build.
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:59.920]  Yeah, I think so helped, helped, helped their margin, right.
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:03.960]  I think, because yeah, I think that there's something, yeah, there's something too that
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:09.000]  where I think that the, the, the refined aluminum, if, you know, if they had held the
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:15.040]  past pattern instead of the five C, the five C wouldn't exist and the, the iPhone five
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:22.160]  would still be sold at that point, which is what the five C is internally, which are also
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.560]  a, I guess if we want to speculate about iPhones, I, I do you think there's going to mean
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:31.760]  an iPhone five CS, which would be an iPhone five S in a plastic case.
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:35.720]  No, I would, hmm, I kind of, I don't know if they're going to call it a five CS because
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:38.120]  it's starting to get like a mouthful.
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:42.760]  To me, the simplest thing is the, the five C drops down, the five S drops down and you
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  get a 4.7 inch.
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:48.360]  Yeah, but I kind of feel like the pattern they set last year is they don't want to sell
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:56.440]  the nice metal case or, you know, exterior in the middle in the middle.
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:15:02.120]  I do feel like I feel like I feel like that year was a set up just to get to the point
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:04.320]  where the plastic cases on the bottom level.
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:05.720]  Yeah, maybe it could be.
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:06.880]  It's either one or the other.
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:08.280]  That's a good, that's a good point.
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:12.840]  It could be about that they needed to get it out one year in advance before it comes down.
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:19.360]  Um, could be, could be, um, I don't know though, I'm not so sure about it.
[1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  I don't know.
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:21.360]  I don't know either.
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:26.480]  I think it's sort of about, see, my, my guess is that it's sort of about setting your
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:31.480]  expectations for which one will cost more before you even turn them on.
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:36.760]  That you can look at a five C and a five S side by side while the screens are off.
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:40.960]  And I think most people would be able to guess which one's more expensive than the other,
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:49.760]  whereas my five S, the current five S, pick your favorite color versus the iPhone six,
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:52.480]  this 4.7 inch iPhone six.
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:55.040]  I don't know that you'd be able to do that, right?
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:59.840]  If you, you know, if you just purely like bigger devices, I guess you'd think this one's nicer,
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:05.120]  but, you know, if you like smaller devices, you might think that the five S is, whereas
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.360]  if they put the five S internals into a five C style plastic case, then it, it sets that
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:11.360]  up.
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:12.360]  I don't know.
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:15.720]  That's a good, I, that's one of the things I'll be looking forward to next month or September,
[1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:16.720]  I guess.
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:17.720]  Right.
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:18.720]  The brick countries.
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:23.600]  No, I, I think that everybody said last year that, that they need to sell a cheap iPhone
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:29.400]  for China, because people in China per capita don't have a lot of money, what do they call
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:30.400]  them?
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:32.480]  Emerging markets is a, the term emerging markets.
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:33.480]  Right.
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:37.560]  And I think, I don't think Apple thinks there are such things as emerging markets.
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:38.560]  I really don't.
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:44.200]  I think the way they approach it is that there's people who can afford iPhones and people
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:49.360]  who can't, you know, and I don't mean it to, to be flippant, you know, but the fact that
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:55.200]  the average person in China, maybe can't afford a iPhone five C, or probably can't afford
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:00.200]  an iPhone C, let's face it, doesn't mean that there aren't millions and millions of people
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:05.320]  in China who can, because there's, you know, billions of people in China.
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:10.920]  The other thing they did in the spring was add an eight gigabyte iPhone five C.
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:11.920]  Yeah.
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:12.920]  That's a little weird.
[1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:17.000]  I kind of wonder if that, anything did, you know, if that had much to do with it.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.360]  Boy, I just can't grow.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:23.320]  I can't believe that the difference from Apple's perspective between eight and 16 gigabytes
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:26.960]  is, is enough to warrant that.
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:30.760]  It just seems miserly to give eight.
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:32.080]  Yeah.
[1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.920]  Because it's, you know, and, you know, and to put a camera in it that can shoot high-def
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:36.920]  video and stuff.
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:39.120]  It's like, wow, that's, it just seems miserly.
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:45.600]  I mean, I was looking at Amazon had a sale on Kindle Fire last week and I was looking
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.400]  at them and it's like the price difference between the, I think there was an eight gigabyte
[1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:53.960]  and a 16 gigabyte and the price difference between the two was like $20.
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:58.480]  And even then you got to figure that's just, just be, you know, the cost difference can't,
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:00.000]  I bet it's less than $20.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:05.040]  But that, that's, you can't, how can you price them $5 apart or whatever?
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:06.040]  Yeah.
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:11.560]  You know, and I know RAM is the same way and that's another John Syracuse frequent complaint
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:18.520]  that Apple always short changes the devices on RAM, you know, that the five, I think we
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:22.360]  still only, I don't know, whatever we have, we all wish we had more than we only have
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.040]  one gigabyte of RAM in that kernel.
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:28.240]  I think that's, that sounds right.
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:33.680]  And it, that it, it comes back to bite Apple in the long run at the tail end, like when
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:40.320]  somebody with a 4S upgrades to iOS 7 and it feels like their phone is running slower.
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:41.320]  Yeah.
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.560]  Like the number one thing Apple could do that would make that better, you know, he thinks
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:53.440]  and I, I agree would be if, if they had doubled the RAM all along, like if every single
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:58.600]  iPhone had shipped, maybe excuse the first generation one because, you know, I was a crazy,
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:00.560]  I can't believe they built this thing.
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:05.560]  But if like the last few years of iPhones had had more, like if they had gone to a gigabyte
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:10.560]  in the years when they had 512 megabytes and if these ones now that have a gigabyte had
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:16.600]  two gigabytes, it would, I think it would give them a lot more headroom down the road
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:20.960]  for like the last supported iOS update they're going to give.
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:21.960]  Yeah.
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.240]  It's sort of a no win situation for them where if they cut them off earlier, everybody
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:28.000]  would be like, wow, I just bought this phone two years ago and I already don't get the
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.240]  software update.
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:32.160]  But then they get the software update and if it makes their phone feel slower because
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:38.080]  they don't have enough RAM because it's optimized for the brand new, you know, the, you
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:42.240]  know, the first priority is to make it awesome on the top of the line iPhone, which
[1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:45.800]  has more RAM than they get, they get bitten.
[1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:53.640]  I know you, you get a limited edition, limited edition like 256 gigabyte iPhone, but my
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:58.320]  wife and I both have the 16, we've been eeking by on 16.
[1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:03.640]  So when I first went, I got the first iPhone, we both had four gigabyte iPhones.
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:08.720]  We were, you know, speaking of limited editions, yeah, that was a real limited, limited
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:10.440]  edition phone.
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:15.840]  And and I use that for two years and towards the end, it got really painful.
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:21.000]  And I'm at the same place now with 16 gigabytes, I was just like, I can't, I can't do
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  it anymore.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  And I don't know.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:26.600]  I just seems, it seems like at some point, they, I mean, they got to jump up.
[1:20:26.600 --> 1:20:32.920]  I could, I could definitely get by with 32, I'd have to, I don't think I am right now.
[1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:39.360]  I think if I, if I check, I think my, it's, it's somewhere in the 40s, my iPhone is filled
[1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:41.040]  up to somewhere around 40 gigs.
[1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:45.400]  So I'm using upwards, you know, towards the 64, but I could, there's a whole bunch of crap.
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:46.400]  I could delete.
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:47.400]  I think.
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:48.400]  Yeah.
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:49.400]  Well, that's out.
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.640]  And that's, I had a 32 gig 3GS.
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:55.720]  And it was just like, you know, I never, I never even came close, particularly during that
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:56.720]  time period.
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.920]  And I felt like I was, I was like loading it up with movies and stuff.
[1:20:58.920 --> 1:20:59.920]  And I was never watching them.
[1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:02.000]  And I thought, well, why am I, why am I doing this?
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.360]  So I kept getting 16 gig phones after that.
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:08.440]  And, and now I finally got to the point where like, okay, now I can't even get stuff
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:13.160]  on there, you know, have all this, all the stuff that I want that I really need on there.
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:17.160]  I will, I will point out before I take a final break for our third sponsor, I will point
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:22.760]  out the, the obvious tension between the fact that half an hour ago, we were singing praises
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:26.680]  of apples, 39% profit margins, right?
[1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:33.400]  And now we're telling them that they should double the ramens and flash storage in every
[1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:38.360]  single model across the board, you know, somewhere at Apple, there's somebody
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:45.080]  is listening, somebody is sitting there listening and smiling and saying, yes, you cannot
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:46.640]  have it both ways.
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:49.320]  Yeah, podcasting makes it easy.
[1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:57.160]  Just give everybody double the ram, it's only it's 50 million phones, you know, that's
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:58.160]  down.
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:04.120]  There is, there is a secret to 39% profit margins, sure, right, right.
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:09.480]  And I, but I feel like I'm looking at new, like, my wife's getting close to needing a new
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:15.480]  MacBook and I'm going to be there probably next year and, and I just can't sanction getting
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:18.680]  a four gigabyte, four gigabytes of memory anymore.
[1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:19.680]  Oh, no.
[1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:21.360]  And 128 gig drive.
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:25.920]  No, I think, I don't know, I, yeah, I think it's got to be more than that.
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:30.760]  Well, yeah, for me, it's not going to go eight, two, fifty six and, well, I, you know,
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:35.680]  I don't know, it's like the modern web pages are just, like when you look in activity
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:40.440]  monitor and you see how each tab now it gets to show you how much RAM it's using.
[1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.840]  It's like, right, it's crazy.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:45.920]  I, you know, not crazy, but you need more than four gigabytes.
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:51.400]  And it just seems, again, we're getting old four gigabytes of RAM sounds like it still
[1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:53.600]  sounds to me magical.
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:58.640]  It's that, because it's the magical barrier where you need 64 bit processing for one
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:00.960]  process to address that much space.
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:06.520]  And I knew about that limit, but like, you know, in the 90s or even the 2000s, it just
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:11.960]  seemed like some beautiful Shangri-La of the future when you would have that much RAM,
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  you know.
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:20.480]  I mean, while I'm, I'm paying for eight megabyte memory chips with my last dollar, load
[1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:28.080]  up an old Mac LC with 16 megabytes of RAM.
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:31.760]  And it just seems crazy that now we're saying, I cannot get by with four gigabytes of
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:32.760]  RAM.
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:35.120]  But, you know, that's how we go with this, right?
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:40.480]  Some, some, some point, I guess we'll be talking about tarot bytes of RAM of that.
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:41.480]  Our kids.
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:46.720]  Well, I will say this, one last point though about it though is that, yes, that's obviously
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:52.320]  there's some tension there between the profit margins and, you know, doubling the RAM
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:54.480]  in flash storage and every single device.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:59.320]  But on the other hand, we do know that Tim Cook in particular and Apple is an institution
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:03.520]  is very, very fanatical about customer satisfaction.
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:09.640]  And again, I'm just ripping John Syracuse off here, but customer satisfaction is definitely
[1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:16.320]  tied to the amount of RAM in your device, especially one or two years down the road.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:22.280]  So, you know, it's, it's a multi, it's like one of those three way tugs of war.
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:27.000]  Like if there's one thing that maybe they would be willing to sacrifice a bit of long-term
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:32.960]  profit margin, just a bit, a bit of long-term profit margin for customer satisfaction
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:36.600]  seems like the type of trade off that they would, they would see as worth it because
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:41.360]  customer satisfaction is a long-term investment, I think.
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  All right.
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:47.600]  Anyway, I want to tell you about a brand new sponsor, new kids on the block, they're
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:51.280]  called Squarespace, Squarespace.
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  Squarespace.
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:53.600]  Can you spell that?
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.800]  S-Q, it's with a Y.
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:56.800]  Okay.
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:00.600]  Actually, according to this, they've been around for a while.
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  Hmm.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:02.600]  Hmm.
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  Seems like something I would have heard of.
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  But anyway, sounds awesome.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  It sounds awesome.
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:11.760]  It is an all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own professional
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:17.400]  website, portfolio, and or online store.
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:20.160]  Online store alone makes it worth it.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:25.760]  Anybody who's ever tried to make, I was going to put a curse word in there, but a
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:32.800]  price shouldn't in a sponsor read, but an online store, it's the biggest pain in the
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.600]  ass you could ever imagine.
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:36.160]  Squarespace makes it easy.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:40.600]  You get a free trial and 10% off.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:46.960]  If you visit Squarespace.com and enter the offer code, JG, just my initials, JG, shortest
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:52.680]  offer code ever at checkout.
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:55.240]  What can I tell you about Squarespace?
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:59.880]  Beautiful design, great templates, a whole bunch of them to choose from.
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:05.880]  You can just pick a template and use it, you can customize it through drag and drop.
[1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:06.880]  Really easy.
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:08.440]  No coding required.
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:14.520]  Make the components you want, drag the components you don't want off, or if you want
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:17.640]  to, get into the code, you can do that too.
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:20.760]  You can get into the code and customize it at that level if you want.
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:25.040]  If you want to stick to the drag and drop, you don't know that stuff, do it that way.
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:27.320]  They have 24.7 support.
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:34.000]  This is a key feature, probably the key feature of Squarespace is the great tech support.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:37.840]  Live chat and email 24.7, no phone.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:39.720]  Who wants to talk to somebody on the phone?
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:40.800]  Phone is terrible.
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:48.080]  You can get them 24.7 live chat and email, and they've got help, tech support locations
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:52.240]  in New York City, Dublin, Ireland, and Portland, Oregon.
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:59.560]  So it covers like the whole Western world of live tech support 24.7.
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:05.280]  Some poor sap is in there on Christmas Eve, waiting for you to build your Squarespace site.
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:06.880]  Amazing.
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.760]  And start at just eight bucks a month, eight bucks, I know I talked to you about Squarespace
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:12.760]  all the time, but think about this.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:17.240]  You get a whole website for eight bucks a month, and that includes a free domain name if
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:19.120]  you sign up for a year.
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.360]  Responsive design on all the templates, everything looks good on the phone, everything looks
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:24.680]  good on tablets.
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.440]  And like I said, an online store that you can just configure through drag and drop.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.640]  So go to squarespace.com, they even have a URL, I don't know what the difference between
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:41.240]  the URL and the code is, but you go to squarespace.com slash Gruber, GRUBER, my last name,
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:45.880]  but use the offer code at the checkout, JG, and you get 10% off whatever it is you sign
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:46.880]  up for.
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:47.880]  So my thanks to them.
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:50.720]  What were we talking about?
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:53.000]  Something about iPads, iPhones?
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.200]  Oh, jamming more ram in for free.
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:57.560]  Yeah, jamming more for free.
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:00.840]  But it's got to go up some time.
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:03.680]  And I feel like we're close to an inflection.
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:06.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:08.600]  And you really can take use of it.
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:15.200]  I mean, I hate to say it, but the device is still, everything is always ram starved at this
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:16.200]  level.
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:17.200]  Yeah.
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:20.880]  You know, you don't see it as much as you used to, but like you switch from one app to
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:24.680]  another and then do another, and then you go back to Safari and your tabs have to reload
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:29.920]  because Safari had to give up a tram and flush all the tabs and just remembers the URLs
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:35.280]  and now, you know, but you're in the supermarket and you're, you get crummy cellular
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:39.280]  reception in the dairy aisle and now your tab doesn't reload fast.
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.040]  You know, it happens, you know, whereas if you had double the ram, your tab would still
[1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:47.080]  be there because you loaded it before you went to the supermarket.
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:49.120]  I do a lot of my reading in the supermarket.
[1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:54.080]  Is there something they do in building a supermarket that shields like cellular connections?
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:55.080]  I don't know.
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:58.520]  Because it seems like every time I go to the supermarket, I get a worse connection than
[1:28:58.520 --> 1:28:59.520]  almost anywhere else.
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:00.520]  Yeah.
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:01.520]  I don't know.
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:03.520]  Maybe it's the shelves that they use or something like that.
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:04.520]  It's the milk.
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:05.520]  Yeah.
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:06.520]  All the liquids.
[1:29:06.520 --> 1:29:07.520]  Yeah.
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:14.040]  I'm absorbing the signal.
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:19.920]  Not a scientist.
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:22.400]  You're not a doctor and I'm not a scientist.
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:25.000]  You know, there's something I wanted, the customer satisfaction thing I wanted to talk
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  about.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:33.640]  He mentions that and I don't know if he said customer sat again this time, but they beat
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:37.000]  that drum throughout that conference call every single quarter.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Well, I should.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:47.480]  And I think that they see it as a way of trying to prove scientifically, you know, however
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:51.160]  much a customer satisfaction survey can be held up as science, but it's certainly better
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:58.400]  than just empty words, you know, that people like Apple products on average better than
[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:05.280]  other people like competing products from other companies, right, which is a long term advantage.
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:11.320]  It's not, it's a way of saying we're not in a commodity, you know, some, a big portion
[1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:19.840]  of these markets that were in laptop computers, tablets, cell phones is a commoditized market,
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.720]  but where we're operating is not a commoditized market and that there's a sizable demand
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:30.840]  for the non commoditized, you know, products at the high end of these markets.
[1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:36.200]  Do you see, do you have a lot of people who, or if people you see with Kindle fires?
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:38.720]  No, I don't see many Kindle fires.
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:41.160]  I don't, that might be a Seattle area thing.
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.160]  Yeah.
[1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:46.120]  I wonder, I wonder if it's just, it's more the area that I live in, but I see, and I also see
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:51.840]  just like a lot of people buying them as cheap tablets for their kids.
[1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:55.360]  Like they think, I think they, some, some people think, well, they think that I should
[1:30:55.360 --> 1:30:57.600]  get the cheapest one because it's just for the kid.
[1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:01.840]  And then they also think that he's probably just going to drop it and I don't want to
[1:31:01.840 --> 1:31:02.840]  drop it in iPad.
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:03.840]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:10.880]  I wonder how the decline in year over year iPad sales already, I mean already, I mean
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:16.040]  like in the life of the product, I, I think part of it is that people when they
[1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:20.520]  get a tablet, if they, if they keep using it, they use it a lot longer than they use
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:24.640]  a cell phone and it's more like laptop in terms of replacement cycle.
[1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:26.840]  Yeah, I guess so.
[1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:35.160]  And, and be maybe, you know, that it's, this is a case where the iPad has become too
[1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:39.200]  expensive, you know, that maybe, I don't know how many of these, I don't know who else is
[1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:43.720]  selling a lot of tablets, but you know, if, if people are buying them, like you said,
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:45.920]  like for kids and stuff like that.
[1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:50.720]  It's a, you know, it's a great reason to buy a $250 device instead of a $500 device.
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:55.440]  If you're given it to a kid who, you know, I mean, you know, look at the way things like
[1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:02.800]  a DS are constructed, right, the, the game boys, you know, they're made to be handled
[1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:08.240]  by children in ways that iPads are not, as I don't, you know, I don't think iPads are
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:12.600]  particularly fragile for tablets, but they do have a glass screen and they're not, they don't
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:13.600]  look rugged.
[1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:14.600]  Right.
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:15.600]  So, I don't know.
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:16.600]  So, I don't know.
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:17.600]  It's just more expensive, more expensive to replace.
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:18.600]  Right.
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:22.400]  And it's not like iPad sales have collapsed, it's just a drop, but, you know, it just
[1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:26.280]  seems worrisome at a time when I think most of us thought that they'd still be going up
[1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:29.400]  just because more and more people would be buying their first tablet.
[1:32:29.400 --> 1:32:30.400]  Yeah.
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:31.400]  It's hard.
[1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:34.960]  I mean, I, you know, I always want to, I always want to, I always want a new one.
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:41.680]  So, I find it, I find it odd that not everybody else does, but here's an interesting customer
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:44.040]  satisfaction angle.
[1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:50.480]  And it's like a long-term thing is that it's a belief.
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:55.560]  And I think this applies at a consumer level and at an enterprise level, like, and I don't
[1:32:55.560 --> 1:33:02.000]  know, I spent a lot of time on an IBM thing, but the Apple has long had the knock against
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:07.080]  it that they charge two higher prices and that they, you know, they're greedy and that
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:13.520]  they make these obscene profits and they charge too much for everything.
[1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:16.160]  And it, their stuff is just too expensive, right?
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:20.920]  And in some, you know, there were some times in the late 90s, early 2000s, where like, you
[1:33:20.920 --> 1:33:25.400]  know, pound for pound, maybe the Mac was more, you know, a comparable Mac was more expensive
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:27.040]  than comparable PC.
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:31.680]  But especially in the Intel Mac era, you know, that's, that's, you know, long ago
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:36.280]  been turned around, where like, there's been a lot of times where, you know, to come to,
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:40.160]  to get the same spec, I remember when the Mac Pros came out last year, the new ones.
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:45.320]  I guess that was earlier this year, you know, people tried to configure the same type of
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:48.840]  thing from Dell and it wasn't going to come in a cool case like the Mac Pro and it was
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:50.760]  way more expensive, right?
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:57.120]  And, and laptops too, like, sure, Apple starting laptop price is $8.99 and, you know,
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:02.120]  there's a lot of companies that sell, you know, $2.99, $3.99 PC laptops, but to get the same
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:09.000]  specs, it actually would cost more and you'd get a lesser build quality, not really fair.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.840]  But people have that belief and I think that when they see little things, they, they're
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:15.840]  viewed through that prism.
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:16.840]  And here's an example.
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:23.120]  I was at a family thing a couple weeks ago and somebody, it was, you know, I outdoors,
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:28.320]  everybody, somebody's barbecuing, we're drinking beer, you know, and somebody had mentioned
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:32.840]  and it wasn't in the context of, hey, I know you, you, you, you write about Apple.
[1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:36.880]  It was just people were talking about iPhones and had nothing to do with me being present.
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:42.080]  I was just flying a wall, wasn't, you know, complained to me about it.
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:49.960]  But it was somebody, a woman who was complaining because she still had an iPhone 4 or 4S,
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:52.800]  I don't know which one, but it had the 30 pin adapter and the thing.
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:57.080]  But her husband had just gotten a new iPhone and his came with lightning, and lightning
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:34:58.640]  adapter.
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:01.360]  And she was like, why did they do that?
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:05.400]  It's, you know, and she, and her, her perspective was that they did it only to get them
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:12.040]  to buy a whole bunch of $29 cables, lightning cables, and that it was a rip off.
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:16.520]  But her annoyance was real in terms of like, now like a single charger in the kitchen doesn't
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:18.960]  work for both of them.
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:20.760]  And it's a short term problem.
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.240]  I just kept my mouth shut.
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:26.600]  This is one of those things that people wonder like, like, what does John Gruber do in that
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  situation?
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:28.600]  You know what I do?
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:34.000]  I just pick up my beer and I take a sip and I keep my mouth shut and I look around and
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.440]  make sure that my dad doesn't do something stupid and be like, well, John knows everything
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:44.160]  about Apple John, you know, I'm like ready to bolt from the chair and maybe go join the
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:47.880]  Whiffleball game or something like that, like I do not want to get involved.
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:54.960]  I do know I can explain to you now that it is, you know, if they don't do it, then
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:59.560]  we're stuck with 30 pin adapters forever and the 30 pin adapter was actually kind of gross.
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:04.440]  It was like a weirdly unhappily type port.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:07.320]  I mean, people complained about that adapter for years.
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:08.320]  Yeah, but it was weird.
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:11.560]  And it served them when they replaced it, but they replaced it.
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:12.560]  Right.
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:17.520]  And they replaced it with a port that is much better in every way than 30 pin and much
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:21.400]  better in every way than micro USB.
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:23.000]  It's more sturdy.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.840]  It works up and down, which is amazing.
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:32.480]  And noise me even more when I have to deal with USB stuff now.
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:37.200]  And you know, they can either make a port that's better or they can never make a new
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:38.520]  port.
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:40.240]  And Apple's way is to do something better.
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:43.640]  And within a few years, all the phones that are in use and all the iPads that are in use
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:46.400]  will all be on lightning and nobody will have that problem.
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:47.400]  But I do understand it's annoying.
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:53.480]  But she, you know, did never even entered into the discussion and never even occurred
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.240]  to her that the lightning adapter on her husband's phone was better.
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:36:58.240]  Was better.
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:02.480]  That's the thing that she completely clearly did not see, completely missed.
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:07.600]  All she could see was that it was totally different, totally incompatible and therefore obviously
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.560]  a money grab.
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:14.080]  And the thing that I think hurts Apple on that regard, I don't think that's even enters
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:15.600]  Apple's mind at all.
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:20.360]  I think whatever profits, I think they do make nice profits on $29 lightning adapters
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:24.400]  or $19 whatever they sell them for.
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:30.080]  But I don't, I don't think materially that they, they add up to, you know, any significance
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:31.080]  part of their.
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:32.080]  Right.
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  But I do think there's a customer satisfaction angle on there where it makes the experience
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:38.080]  better.
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:39.080]  Right.
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:45.840]  Well, no, but that it, it hurts, sir, it, it, when you use a lightning adapter, it does help
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:47.200]  your customer satisfaction.
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:51.320]  And I think it, you know, if it's the only device you have instead of them using it instead
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.720]  of micro USB is why Apple gets better scores.
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:38:00.760]  But I do think there's a negative thing where people think, ah, they did this just to practically
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:03.400]  steal $29 for me.
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:09.160]  Like I feel like maybe they, they should rethink their pricing policy on things like extra
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:15.640]  adapters and, and, and, and straighter margins further again, I'm giving them advice that
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:17.920]  it will hurt their profit margins.
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:23.800]  But I feel like whatever damage it would do to their profit margins to sell things like
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:31.400]  lightning adapters and, you know, everything that they sell for $29 or less.
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:35.560]  All of those things, if they, you know, really drop the price on a lot of those things
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:40.960]  and sold them closer to cost, the goodwill would be, would be more valuable than whatever
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:44.320]  it would, it would take to their profit margins is my theory.
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:48.600]  Now again, there might be some guy at Apple with a spread sheet that says otherwise
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:49.760]  shaking his head.
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:50.760]  Yeah, right.
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:51.760]  I ran the numbers.
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:53.880]  You're wrong.
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:55.640]  And he doesn't even have an office chair.
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.280]  He just sits on a throne of $100 bills.
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:05.560]  It's just billion dollars in cash.
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.560]  It's that that mountain of cash for that the Joker set fire to in the back end of
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  the year.
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:12.040]  He's just sitting there up top there.
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:15.240]  I'm counting on lightning adapter.
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:18.760]  This green I shade things on.
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:19.760]  But I do.
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:23.760]  I think people have this notion that Apple is out to, out to nickel and done, not nickel
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:24.760]  and diamond.
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:26.680]  Because it's not quite nickel and diamond.
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:31.480]  Like, I do think people know that that they don't, you know, I think that's part of
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:35.560]  the reason people are switching to max is that you don't open your Mac and get nagged
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:37.680]  to buy antivirus and stuff like that.
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.520]  You open your Mac and they don't ask you to buy anything else.
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:46.360]  So it's not nickel and diamond, it's something else, but that it's, you know, that they're
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.800]  looking for money.
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:52.200]  And that the stuff is way too expensive.
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:56.080]  And I think also it's maybe partly because they know who to blame, they know to blame Apple.
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:01.680]  Whereas in the old days, it was notorious that every brand of phone had a different custom
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:03.280]  adapter for power.
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:07.560]  And that if you lost it, God Almighty, you'd have to go into the Verizon store, AT&T
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:11.880]  or everybody, your phone, and show them your phone and be like, I need to model too.
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:16.400]  Each model, yeah, you couldn't just say, I got a Nokia, you'd be like, here's my, here
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:22.560]  is my phone, you know, and they'd be like, oh, you need the XL 47, eight, that'll be
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:28.280]  $50, you know, it was, they were crazy expensive.
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:31.720]  Or if you wanted to do, you know, you'd get one, if you wanted to buy a second one so you
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:34.760]  could charge your phone at work, you know, and keep your other one at home or something
[1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:35.760]  like that.
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:37.760]  It's expensive, way more expensive than Apple's.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.000]  But I feel like when it's your carrier doing it, you just, you don't even think to complain
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.440]  about it, because you know they're going to screw you.
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:46.720]  Whereas I think people feel like Apple shouldn't be screwing them.
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:52.960]  We had, I mean, we had collected so many of those dock connector cords that, you know,
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:57.720]  I had them lying all over the house so you could, you could power a phone anywhere.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:04.680]  And now we're at a low point again until I build up my inventory and somebody the other
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:09.240]  night, just like a friend who lives up the streets that said, so they wanted to borrow
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:13.120]  one of those cables for like a lightning cable for a week and I was like, I can't have
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  one of mine.
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:19.320]  No, you've got an extra one, you can give them yours, but I'm not farting with any of
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:20.320]  mine.
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:24.600]  I don't like them, I don't like them that much.
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:38.280]  I got one more thing, do you hear the thing that Ryan Block and, uh, the Comcast thing?
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:43.200]  Yeah, where they, I didn't, I couldn't listen to it because it just, those kinds of things
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:45.480]  make me cringe.
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:53.160]  I haven't listened to about a minute for the same reason, yeah, but yeah.
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:59.600]  So Ryan Block and Veronica Belmont, who, who, they got married a couple of years ago and
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:06.840]  they decided to cancel their Comcast service and apparently Veronica was, was on the phone
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:10.800]  is going to, you know, and that's still one for the team is calling, you know, that's,
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:15.400]  that's one of those things where, where when you're a couple, when one of you decides,
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:22.440]  I'll call Comcast, you know, you, you don't have to do the dishes that night, right?
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:26.400]  And she called just to say, we want to cancel our Comcast service.
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:27.400]  I don't know, but it doesn't even matter.
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:31.760]  I don't know if they're replacing it with files or something like that, but, um, number
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:40.680]  one, you know that those two know what they're doing, uh, co-founder of, uh, in gadget and
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:47.040]  the host of like more tech TV shows than anybody I know, uh, probably we are making an
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:52.160]  informed decision to cancel Comcast and it, she just couldn't, couldn't get the guide
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:57.280]  to cancel their service and, and then had to hand the phone over to Ryan and he started
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:42:59.640]  recording the call and it's just absurd.
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:03.360]  I mean, if you can take things like this, you should, and you have it, you should just Google
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:10.400]  Ryan Block and Veronica Belmont canceled Comcast, um, it went viral as they say, because
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:12.000]  the guy was, it was just absurd.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.800]  The guy was like, why do you want slower internet and Ryan Block was like, why won't
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:22.800]  you just cancel my service? And he's like, I'm trying to understand why you want to get
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:29.840]  slower internet. And he's like, I'm trying to understand why you won't cancel my service.
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:30.840]  Just cancel.
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:31.840]  That's all I want to do.
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:36.280]  Uh, and it went on and on. It was like 10 minutes long. And, and the thing that's great
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:41.480]  is it went viral and the thing about that is, um, the guy had to like address it, like
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:45.680]  Comcast chief operating officer had to address it and say that it was painful to listen
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:50.920]  to this call. And I am not surprised that we've been criticized for it, respecting our
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:56.440]  customers is fundamental and we fell short in this instance. I know these retention calls
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:00.840]  are, I guess it's an internal memo. It's not really meant for public distribution. These
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:05.560]  retention calls are tough. And I have tremendous admiration for our retention professionals
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:08.840]  who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast.
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.040]  Oh my God. That's so awful. That's so, that's actually even worse.
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:18.560]  A number of sites, and I forget where I read it, probably the verge or someplace, but
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:25.720]  didn't wrote about the economics behind these people's jobs. And basically their whole incentive
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:30.000]  their whole compensation package is wrapped up in the number of people that they can convince
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  to stay.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.760]  You know, I thought that I just thought it from listening to the part of the call I heard
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:39.560]  was that the guy was into it enough or it was clearly not just getting an hour, you know,
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:44.680]  a ton of bucks an hour. It was, he was invested. It was a car salesman title.
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:48.480]  Yeah, it's the reverse. Yeah, it's the, it's like it's like a car salesman. It's like
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:49.480]  selling.
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:50.920]  It's like they're selling it all over again.
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:51.920]  Right.
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:56.280]  But it's weird because it's like, and car salesman, I'm sure, you know, it's in famous, famously
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:45:02.720]  shady, you know, operators and they know all sorts of tricks, but it's like, and I'm sure
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:11.200]  they take advantage of some people who come in naive or who are timid, you know, not
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:16.920]  that you and I are, you know, tough guys. Right. But it's like, if we were in a car dealer,
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:20.600]  you and I are going out to buy a convertible to spend, you know, take a summer road trip
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.480]  and we're going to buy a convertible, you and I go in and we don't like what we're hearing
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:29.040]  and we start walking out the door and the guy tries to keep us from walking out the door.
[1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:32.640]  We're still walking out the door, right? You can just walk it like, you know, as shady
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:36.480]  as a car dealer, you know, dealer can be, you know, you can just keep moving your feet
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:40.160]  and eventually you are out the door and you're not listening to them anymore. Whereas
[1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:47.440]  if you are already hooked up, that's the thing, you're hooked up to auto bill Comcast, $100
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:51.280]  a month. And even if you call your credit card and say, don't pay them, they're going to,
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:54.720]  you know, they're going to put your accountant collection until they officially disconnect
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:46:00.800]  you. You've signed a thing that you're sending them $100 or, you know, $150 a month.
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:06.800]  You need them to do this. And if they won't do it, what can you do? This is such rotten
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:12.560]  double-speed. And Jackie Chang had posted on Twitter a reminder that, and I forget the
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:16.280]  names of these services, but those services that where you get people to do like a task
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:20.480]  for you, task for them. Oh, yeah, yeah. You can, you can actually call those guys and
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:26.120]  have them go like this, you know, disconnect your case. Call Comcast and disconnect your
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:31.240]  Comcast for you. So if you don't want to sit on the phone with that guy, this, you know,
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:36.880]  and it just ties right in with me, Lincoln to the, the George Orwell politics in the English
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:43.720]  language, like who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast. If that's
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:53.040]  not the most rotten double-speed, I've ever heard, that is so much more evil than if he
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:47:03.240]  just flat out said who make it difficult for customers to leave. Right. Right. Because it's
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:08.720]  exactly what it means. It is exactly, it is like like three plus three on one side and
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:19.880]  six on the other who make it difficult for customers to leave Comcast. We have, you, you
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:26.200]  have Comcast, right? I do. I live in Comcast country. Yeah. I'm in cable town. Right. And
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:32.960]  it literally our Skype call is getting crick, creaky. I swear to God, you can't make this
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:47.920]  up. You're starting to say, you know, I kind of pat myself in the back because we have
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:55.640]  here to come. I've said this before, we have city provided internet service. And so I don't
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:02.280]  have to use Comcast, but, but I, but I do for our, we have a landline. We didn't fill it out
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:10.440]  if you have a Comcast provided city. I've told you they literally, they have the tallest
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:15.680]  skyscraper in Philadelphia. It is the Comcast center. They have just bought a plot of land,
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:22.880]  a block away, and they are going to build a new tallest skyscraper. You're an internet
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:35.640]  should be super fast. Thanks to them building two and completely non disconnectable. Anyway,
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:41.280]  what a rotten, rotten, rotten company. This is terrible. I don't know. That's it for me
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.040]  for this week though. You got anything? Okay. Did you, did you talk about the Microsoft
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:52.600]  playoffs? Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. And that's how it's home. 18,000 people
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:58.760]  over the next year. But 12,000 don't count because they're fine, or something is from
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:04.360]  New Kia. Yeah, they don't count. Yeah. No, I, you know, I hate to make jokes about
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:07.520]  or Finland. I, you know, I don't want to make jokes about layoffs because, you know, who,
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.600]  I'll bet there's got to be somebody who just listens to the show who's one of them.
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:17.440]  So I'm sure it's that, you know, I've lost jobs and it's, it's not fun. I tried to get laid
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:24.680]  off for years. It didn't work. It's the worst. It never happens to the people who want
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:31.480]  it. No, I never happens to the people deserve it. It's like, we're going to have some
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.880]  layouts. Here's the list and then you raise your hand and you're like, what about buyouts?
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:44.080]  Maybe we're going to buyouts too early retirement. They knew I was going to leave. That's
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:51.920]  why they didn't lay me off. Yeah, it's, you know, it's kind of sad. You know, I mean, you
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.160]  know, they kind of need it as a business. But yeah, it's not, you know, it's not never good
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:03.000]  for the people in it. No. And it's, you know, it's humbling because I think it's not that
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:08.280]  many years ago when the idea of a Microsoft layoff would have been unthinkable. Yeah, you
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:12.800]  know, and it's a reminder, you know, a wake up called everybody else, you know, for companies
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:19.320]  like Google and Apple who are in Amazon, who are the, you know, the big tech companies
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:24.000]  of the last decade. And who've never had a layoff that, you know, if it could happen to
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.320]  Microsoft, man, it could happen to anybody. I mean, Apple's had layoffs, but never like
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:35.800]  a mass layoff. And it hasn't been not in the modern era of Apple. Yeah. Um, you know,
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:46.760]  you got to be careful about getting fat. Tell me about it. Did you read Ben Thompson's
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:53.480]  piece on breaking Microsoft up? Yeah. That was, it was a good piece. I don't think it's
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:59.280]  going to happen. No, I don't think so either because I think it, if it would have, if
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:02.920]  that was on the table, it would have happened instead of this. And it would have happened
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:09.320]  maybe coincident with, uh, Satya, Nadella taking over. You know, I mean, I think that's
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:14.000]  an alternate universe where the, what do they do post bomber? Maybe is break it up, you
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:18.600]  know, whereas now I don't, I don't think that they would do that. I don't know that
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:24.000]  that is. I mean, so just to recap his theory. I mean, his idea is that Microsoft is
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:29.040]  turning into a services company so that the hardware and operating system part should
[1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:37.240]  be put into a different company and run separately. Yeah, it does make sense. You know,
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:42.840]  and there's a certain, there's a certain, uh, what's the word? It just doesn't make sense
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:46.880]  there at odds with each other where there's a part of Microsoft that sees it as a company
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:51.000]  that provides software to OEMs. And now there's a part of the company that sees itself
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:57.120]  as an OEM. Right. And, and that's just not compatible. And they can kind of yada yada
[1:51:57.120 --> 1:52:02.400]  yada to make it seem like it's compatible because the revenue and profits are still coming
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:06.880]  in. But it just does, it's at a common sense level. It just doesn't make sense that
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:12.120]  they can be providing these software to companies to make mobile devices and they're
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:16.480]  going to make their own mobile devices without favoring one or the other. You know, and
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:20.160]  everybody who's tried it, it never works. You know, so Google, you know, it's provide
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:25.040]  software to OEMs with Android and they make their own Android devices, but very few people
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:29.040]  use Google's Android devices. They've never really taken off, you know, and if like the
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:35.640]  Nexus in some alternate world where the Nexus phones are huge hits, uh, that, you know,
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:40.080]  Samsung isn't going to be using Android, you know, it's just, you know, it just wouldn't
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:47.480]  work. Uh, you know, and like go back to the 90s when Apple licensed the Mac OS, it, you
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:53.840]  know, just doesn't, it didn't work. Yeah. So it's an interesting idea, but I just, there's
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:59.880]  too much institutional, I mean, there's, there's no way they could get rid of Windows.
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:03.920]  No, I think, you know, I, I, and I don't think it needs, I just think Windows could be
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:07.640]  run as its own division, but I think that they should stop thinking of the Windows division
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:12.000]  as anything other than legacy. Just let it be what it is. And it's PC operating system
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:16.560]  in an ever shrinking market, but that is huge. And it's probably, you know, eventually
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  going to level off like the shrinkage. You know, if, like I just said to you, the IDC
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:24.520]  for this past quarter is at the PC market, trying 2% year over a year. It seems like maybe
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:27.840]  the bleeding is over, you know, I think it's going to keep dwindling and it's going
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:34.680]  to keep dwindling in terms of the overall pie chart of computing devices, because it's not
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:38.760]  just that smartphones and tablets are replacing PCs is that we're adding multiple
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:45.680]  devices, you know, that are what used to be thought of as a PC. And that the share of them
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  that are traditional PCs is getting smaller, in addition to the fact that people are buying
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:55.080]  fewer actual units year over year. But just let it run, you know, and I think that's
[1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:59.080]  the problem, the whole base of problem with Windows 8 is trying to make this, you know,
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:03.280]  trying to please two groups at once, whereas if they had just made a Windows 8 that was
[1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:10.400]  like Windows 7, like here, if you have a traditional laptop or a desktop PC, here you go,
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:15.760]  here's a new version of Windows better than ever. And we've got this other entirely new mobile
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:21.040]  operating system. Yeah. But it's weird now, it's weird now that they, you
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:26.720]  know, his Nadella's old memo was about, you know, we're now a company that helps people
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:34.880]  get things done. And they still have all this entertainment stuff. Nick's, they did
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:40.560]  Nick's making TV shows. Yeah. They've always had, they still have the Xbox, which does not
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:44.880]  seem to have, that does not fit into that mandate at all. Yeah. And I think, you know,
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:48.560]  I've had that thought too. I've tossed out ideas and I've thought like, hey, if Netflix
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:53.200]  commissions TV shows, why does an Apple commission TV shows, you know, for Apple TV and have,
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:58.560]  you know, new Kevin Spacey show that's only on Apple TV. But you know what, that way lies
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.040]  lack of focus. I'm not saying Apple would never do that particular thing, but, you know,
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:09.360]  they certainly can't do all of them. You know, and I don't know, making, making TV shows was,
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:13.200]  you know, never would Microsoft was good at. I've just, I've always found that this whole
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:19.600]  thing that the, these companies think that they need to do everything to be counterproductive,
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:25.680]  but what do I know? Yeah. Well, I do think that there's, it's always seen that way to me.
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:31.200]  Like, I thought it was crazy in the 90s when, when Microsoft started jointly with NBC, the
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:36.960]  MSNBC, I was like, what are you doing? Why would you, why would you want to make a CNN competitor?
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:41.360]  You're Microsoft, you know, you know what I mean? Like, I can see why somebody would want to make
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:45.840]  a CNN competitor, right? I can see why multiple people would, but why would Microsoft, why,
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:50.320]  you know, why do you feel like you need everything, including a news, you know, channel and,
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.760]  and, you know, and the whole thing, you know, wound up not working out that well.
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:00.880]  I mean, MSNBC is a fine network, but I mean, I'm at Microsoft, the, the MS in, in MSNBC,
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:04.240]  hasn't stood for Microsoft for, I don't know, better part of the decade. I mean, they've been
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:10.720]  out of that forever. It was very strange. We should have a Kickstarter for us to buy Microsoft.
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:18.080]  I did see that they're, you know, that they, they're stocked. They did quarterly results today,
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:23.840]  too. And they, they missed, but only missed because of Nokia, the Nokia division, which
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:29.200]  did a little bit worse than expected. And the stock market reacted, you know, with no reaction,
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.520]  whatsoever. No, I mean, I think it's right. I don't think anybody should have been surprised by
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:37.200]  that, right? I think common sense prevails. I don't know. Before we started recording, it looked
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:42.960]  like after hours Apple was about even two. I don't know if it's still true, but that's always
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.760]  kind of, that's getting weird, like having, having the stock market not panic after hours
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:54.640]  at no matter what happens with Apple. Yeah, it seems like that, the whole, that whole thing
[1:56:54.640 --> 1:57:00.240]  is kind of turned a bit. Yeah, they seem to be a little bit more happy with what's going on
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:06.720]  despite, you know, I mean, the usual, the usual suspects are still being jerks, but yeah, it looks
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:15.520]  like it's nice and even. It's taken around 94 bucks. You know, was it bad? He was Ben Thompson
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.760]  who was on the show a couple weeks ago. And I thought he made a very keen observation that I've
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:27.040]  never really heard before, which is that the stock market rewards the gut feeling that even if you
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:31.520]  screw up, you being the company that they're evaluating in a process. Even if you screw up,
[1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:38.160]  you'll still be in business. And that that's where Apple got hurt for years and years, where
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:44.640]  there's just, there used to be this consensus that Apple was always on the precipice and one slip
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:50.880]  away from, you know, the whole house of cards falling under. And I feel like that they've,
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:55.120]  you know, none of these dire things have happened, like margins collapsing or whatever, and
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:58.880]  everybody's sort of got in the idea that, hey, Apple could screw up, you know, like they could
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:04.720]  release an iPhone 6 that is not that popular and they are not going to go under. You know, they
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:10.880]  could have the next, you know, the next Mac cube come out and, you know, wouldn't be good, wouldn't
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:15.520]  be good news, but it's not going to, you know, it's not a house of cards that's going to fall down to
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:19.920]  sturdy foundation. And I'd only take them 35 years to realize that.
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:28.560]  Right, slow learners. Yeah. All right, John Moltz, thank you for joining me. Thank you.

[1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:40.560]  want to see you as John M. You're not John M. You're Moltz. Yeah. I'm right there. And I'm Moltz
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:44.320]  to everybody basically. But it's got to be the same for me with you. Like if I text you,
[1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:47.840]  you don't want to see John Chi. You don't like who the hell is that? Right. Right.
[1:59:47.840 --> 2:00:07.680]  That we call me John G. That's in the first grade. Right. The curse of the John's. Yeah.
