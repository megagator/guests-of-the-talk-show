[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  I've got too many iPads
[00:02.600 --> 00:08.520]  I've got way too many iPads. I I don't just have too many iPads. I have too many iPad keyboards
[00:09.600 --> 00:11.840]  so many iPad keyboards
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.860]  and as
[00:13.860 --> 00:15.860]  Do you hear that as I'm sitting here?
[00:16.440 --> 00:18.640]  They're all falling apart as I try to
[00:19.160 --> 00:22.400]  Prop them open in a space that is not meant for
[00:23.320 --> 00:25.320]  having
[00:25.320 --> 00:31.080]  Multiple iPads configured. Jason, how you doing? Doing great. How are you? I'm discombobulated
[00:31.480 --> 00:35.000]  honestly, but I'm used to Apple product announcements having clarity and
[00:38.400 --> 00:46.560]  Yeah, what a week it's been my theory is that this is pandemic and supply chain related because you got to think
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.000]  This is not how they drew it up
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.320]  I think that Apple took the iPad Pro and was like we can't update it right now and they just punted on that
[00:53.320 --> 00:59.440]  Let's just stick an M2 in it and be done because they would probably rather introduce new features at the high end of the product
[00:59.440 --> 01:00.000]  line, right
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.320]  But they didn't and so we end up in in a weird situation where two features that I think
[01:06.760 --> 01:10.560]  suggest Apple changing its mind about what an iPad should have
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.280]  appearing on the
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.480]  Low cost although not lowest cost because there's still the other one iPad in the line
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.920]  I think it's great that Apple has made those changes, but if you've got an iPad Air or an iPad Pro or want to buy
[01:23.920 --> 01:27.560]  A new one that they're not there yet and maybe they'll be there in 18 months. I don't know
[01:27.560 --> 01:30.000]  Yeah, it's sort of like we're starting with
[01:30.560 --> 01:37.720]  starting with our conclusion, but I am in complete agreement where I think that if you want to make sense out of the
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.400]  Aspects of this week's iPad news that don't make sense it all comes
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.560]  I think it all comes down to this is in the fall of
[01:47.560 --> 01:49.560]  2022
[01:49.600 --> 01:52.640]  We're starting to see more fallout from
[01:53.880 --> 01:56.360]  spring 2020 onward of
[01:57.320 --> 01:59.320]  remote work of
[01:59.640 --> 02:02.920]  inability for people from Apple to travel to China or a
[02:03.440 --> 02:11.040]  Significant reduction for obvious reasons over that time period and given the time frames that hardware gets developed on I don't think it's a stretch
[02:12.480 --> 02:14.960]  Priority wise let's face it iPhone is
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.440]  The top priority of the company for obvious reasons. It's the most popular product. It makes the most money and
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.280]  The I or I foot did I say iPhone? Yeah. Yeah for a second there
[02:28.280 --> 02:34.640]  I thought I said iPad which is the opposite point. Anyway, iPhone is number one and iPhone has
[02:35.880 --> 02:37.960]  admirably seemingly not
[02:37.960 --> 02:45.480]  Slipped at all even in 2020. It was only arguably weeks late weeks behind
[02:45.600 --> 02:52.440]  Which is just a phenomenal achievement for the company and it makes sense that if you're going to put things in a certain order
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.080]  That would be the order you put them
[02:54.080 --> 03:00.280]  But I think that sort of why did the camera move on this iPad in a way that everybody wanted but didn't move on this
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.920]  Other one that people actually use in a laptop configuration more
[03:03.920 --> 03:10.200]  I have a little bit of a theory which is the theory of Apple's product cycles where they use the same enclosure for a few
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.800]  Years, right because you're not going to introduce people always forget this when this happens
[03:13.800 --> 03:19.800]  But like Apple doesn't introduce a brand new industrial design for every device they introduce, right?
[03:19.800 --> 03:25.920]  they cycle it two or three or four times and I do think that part of having that strategy is
[03:26.040 --> 03:30.200]  that if you've got a product that you're targeting for let's say 2022 and
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.960]  Then at some point in the year leading up to that you realize it's not gonna make it
[03:36.400 --> 03:43.880]  You have a fallback which is we're going to rev the existing product another year and push that off a year, right?
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.360]  So who's to say I mean maybe Mark Gurman knows or Ming Chi Kuo knows or something
[03:48.360 --> 03:53.120]  Somebody else might know but like who's to say that the 2023 iPhone
[03:54.280 --> 03:56.880]  Wasn't and I don't know this either. I'm just saying as an example
[03:56.880 --> 04:04.040]  Wasn't originally targeted for 22 and then in the midst of everything in 2020 and 21
[04:04.360 --> 04:07.440]  At some point they said we can't make that at that point
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.040]  We got a third year of the previous design and they pushed it off
[04:12.200 --> 04:18.080]  It gives you the trapdoor and I look at the iPad Pro now and I think that's basically what they did is they've got
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.280]  Clearly they know what the next iPad Pro is going to be but for whatever reason
[04:22.280 --> 04:28.920]  They looked at this time frame and they're like we can't do it. And so instead we get the fourth go-round
[04:29.360 --> 04:31.640]  essentially of the same industrial design and
[04:32.160 --> 04:38.880]  I think the display analyst Ross Young was saying that you can look for some OLED iPad pros in early
[04:39.320 --> 04:46.360]  24 so it's another 18 month wait for that. Yeah, I again I'm in complete agreement and I do think it's fascinating
[04:46.520 --> 04:48.520]  I think Apple's
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.480]  Hardware
[04:50.480 --> 04:57.200]  Planning and engineering schedule is one of the great untold stories of the company
[04:57.560 --> 04:59.600]  I've always thought this I mean and
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.900]  Apple loves to brag that there and rightfully so very rightfully so I think it is the key
[05:05.900 --> 05:10.700]  It's why you and I have devoted our careers to covering the company. What's it to me?
[05:10.700 --> 05:14.480]  It's what makes them the most interesting is that they're the one company that is
[05:15.520 --> 05:20.320]  Like an optical illusion they do the hardware and the software and you can look at them and say they're a hardware company
[05:20.320 --> 05:26.040]  That does software or they're a software company that follows the Alan Kay axiom
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.980]  That if you really care about software you do your own hardware and at their best. It's truly 50-50 and it
[05:32.600 --> 05:38.840]  Fears but as much as they are both very much both and you can look at them through either prism
[05:39.680 --> 05:40.600]  the
[05:40.600 --> 05:47.800]  The nature of hardware and software is such it that it's profoundly different so that you can do things like cut features
[05:47.800 --> 05:50.800]  from an operating system that were promised and
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.800]  Just deliver them in point one point two point three point four all the way
[05:55.800 --> 05:58.680]  I mean, what are we up to iOS fifteen fifteen point six?
[05:58.680 --> 06:04.740]  I think they got to fourteen point eight last year almost monthly closer to monthly and at least by monthly
[06:04.880 --> 06:11.320]  Dot releases that tend to add these new features and they can adjust that plan on the fly
[06:11.320 --> 06:17.680]  I don't think it was their plan all along for iPad OS not to ship until the end of October
[06:17.680 --> 06:24.720]  I think I ideally it would have like previous years shipped at the same time iOS did for iPhones
[06:24.880 --> 06:28.720]  But they can do things like that hardware. You don't get to do stuff like that
[06:29.640 --> 06:32.200]  You know, you can make you can bail out on something
[06:32.200 --> 06:36.000]  But nobody knows and it happened a year before or it's the whole thing, right?
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.320]  You don't just get to say oh we were kind of gonna do a 48 megapixel
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.560]  Sensor for the main camera, but it's not quite ready
[06:45.560 --> 06:49.560]  So we'll just put another sensor in there and it's like no you don't get to do that at the last minute
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.620]  so I would suspect that if the if there is some truth to that and maybe
[06:55.360 --> 07:02.980]  At the end of 2019 or January and February right before March of 2020 if the idea was for
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.480]  the
[07:04.480 --> 07:10.760]  2022 iPhones to be called the 14 and 14 Pro to be different than what we actually saw
[07:10.760 --> 07:15.800]  That decision to postpone came very early in kovat, right?
[07:15.800 --> 07:20.160]  like yeah, the shutdown happens and that time and I think
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  Tim Cook is seems
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.560]  Wise in such ways right where when the shutdown first happened?
[07:27.560 --> 07:31.680]  I mean remember it was like I have we better you know, we're shut everything down for a couple of weeks
[07:33.720 --> 07:34.840]  And
[07:34.840 --> 07:38.400]  I've I of course thought that I think most people did like yeah
[07:38.400 --> 07:45.280]  This is radical and like a four week five week shutdown of life as we know it to let this pass
[07:45.640 --> 07:49.400]  Seemed radical right that would have that was the most crazy thing
[07:49.760 --> 07:51.920]  disease wise pandemic wise that
[07:52.620 --> 07:56.400]  anybody who's alive has ever experienced right you'd have to go back to the
[07:57.040 --> 08:01.440]  Spanish flu from literally a hundred bizarrely almost exactly a hundred years ago
[08:01.440 --> 08:04.600]  And I remember I think I've told this story on the show
[08:04.600 --> 08:09.840]  but when they first sent the kids home from school the very first day, I think it was a Friday or
[08:10.440 --> 08:14.360]  maybe the Friday was the last day and they're like no more school for a month and
[08:15.800 --> 08:19.600]  Jonas came home and said yeah, we were talking in class with her
[08:19.600 --> 08:24.280]  I forget what class the teacher taught but it wasn't the science teacher which was interesting
[08:24.280 --> 08:30.600]  But the teacher was saying how we'll see in a month and we'll be on zoom and the kids were all like thinking it through
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.320]  And they were like, yeah, we're not coming back this year, you know, and I forget how they thought about it
[08:35.320 --> 08:41.440]  But they've kind of figured it out and their intuitive sense that no if it's bad enough to do this isn't going this isn't gonna
[08:41.440 --> 08:43.960]  Go away in a month and they kind of talked their teacher into it
[08:43.960 --> 08:48.600]  And I was like, you know that that's really insightful because you kids don't have
[08:50.120 --> 08:52.840]  Decades of this is what normal life is like
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.920]  Preconceptions which
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.240]  Overriding your your you've got your priors that you're taking into account that they don't have to take into account and say no
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.640]  Why wouldn't it just take us out for the whole year? Yeah, and he talked me into it
[09:06.640 --> 09:07.920]  I was like damn you're right
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.880]  this is gonna this is gonna be longer and I wouldn't be surprised if Tim Cook sort of had that foresight and Jeff Williams and
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.320]  The other big planners in that very early by let's say the end of April
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.720]  They were like we need to
[09:19.720 --> 09:27.480]  conservatism our plans and make sure that we've got a 2022 iPhone and this that the other whatever products we
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.160]  Absolutely need to ship that we know that we can do even if we're severely
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.400]  Restricted in these ways so I wouldn't be surprised because that would have been and that timeline would work
[09:37.400 --> 09:43.400]  Right, like I think and you could certainly and I don't have any information like that's just pure theory
[09:43.400 --> 09:45.720]  But I think that is always part of their
[09:45.720 --> 09:51.840]  Planning because once you have that situation where you keep a piece of hardware and just do some basic updates
[09:51.840 --> 09:54.800]  And then you you revise it every two three four years
[09:55.320 --> 10:00.920]  It gives you the luxury to say let's do one more cycle before we get that new thing
[10:00.920 --> 10:06.200]  right, and I don't know whether they did that in the iPhone because they have done three year cycles before the
[10:07.080 --> 10:09.680]  iPad Pro I'm gonna say it's possible
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.600]  That was one of those ideas where they're just like look not now is not the time and you end up with everything kind of
[10:14.600 --> 10:18.760]  Out-of-sync like it is I would say the other one that I'll throw it out
[10:18.760 --> 10:24.400]  There is the iMac right where it seems kind of weird that there's only the one iMac and that according to Mark Gurman
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.600]  There's not even gonna be an m2 iMac and they're gonna just leave it for m3 and like that feels like another one of those
[10:31.600 --> 10:40.280]  Things where they probably had a nice chart in 2020 or 2019 that said here is our rolling out of all of our products and
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.600]  Some of that stuff got taken off the board because of kovat and not like we're not gonna do that product
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.920]  But more like that product needs to wait a year or two. And so when you look at these products individually
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.080]  You're like, oh that's a perfectly reasonable product the iPads I'm talking about
[10:53.080 --> 10:59.080]  But then you look at the iPad as a product line and you go. Well, wait a second. Yeah, why I mean
[10:59.080 --> 11:04.280]  There are some weird choices in the individual products that I'm sure we're gonna talk about but like that's the big picture thing
[11:04.280 --> 11:09.080]  It's like why over here and not over there and they're never gonna say but I suspect the answer is
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.600]  Because we didn't revise that product for reasons and so you get to see it here first
[11:14.600 --> 11:18.360]  Yeah, my gut feeling is the iPad Pro definitely or not definitely
[11:18.360 --> 11:23.120]  But it would be the most likely to have suffered such a fate that these new iPad pros
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.800]  I kind of suspect that this year's iPhones probably are exactly as they were planned all along and there are some
[11:29.800 --> 11:35.680]  You know like the dynamic island and that the hole punch cut out the pros getting the a16 the 48 megapixel sensor
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.280]  There's a lot in there. So I kind of think
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.280]  strategically the fact that the iPhone 14 non pro is
[11:45.960 --> 11:52.640]  Much more it truly an incremental up update could be called the 14 s or 13 s
[11:52.760 --> 11:58.840]  Yes for it in previous terms where it really just sort of got what an extra GPU
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.120]  Core didn't even get a new chip, right? And I think strategically that's something they wanted
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.120]  They've been moving towards
[12:06.520 --> 12:13.080]  For a decade trying to get a new super tier and a new phones every year
[12:13.400 --> 12:16.440]  that aren't called Pro, but that are new and
[12:17.440 --> 12:20.760]  But the iPads, I don't know also about the phone
[12:20.760 --> 12:22.760]  I think the most likely thing and we have
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.200]  Occasionally seen something like this is like there are a lot of rumors out there about the next iPhone, right?
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.960]  The iPhone 15 which is ridiculous you often last year. I think it actually lapped to the iPhone 14
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.680]  Yeah, 13 they were talking about the 14 the 13 wasn't out yet, but it you know, and again
[12:37.680 --> 12:41.200]  I'm not saying that it's gonna happen. I don't have any inside information, but like
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.840]  Any time between now and like January there could be a report. That's that says
[12:48.920 --> 12:56.640]  Actually, the iPhone 15 isn't gonna have that periscope camera system and all of that and I would read that as being that
[12:56.640 --> 13:02.320]  Same kind of recalibration which is it's if you have an issue and you're like we can't do it in this time frame and your
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.320]  Apple well, you're not gonna not do an iPhone. So the answer is gonna be what's the fallback?
[13:06.320 --> 13:08.720]  the fallback is another iteration of
[13:09.520 --> 13:12.360]  The 14 hardware and I don't think that's their plan
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.440]  They have been on the last couple of cycles a three year cycle for this stuff
[13:17.720 --> 13:20.800]  But if I'm Apple and if I'm Tim Cook, I want to be prudent
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.280]  You can't not do a phone
[13:22.280 --> 13:28.400]  So you gotta have a fallback and that's the nice thing about this approach of having the same body get reused for a few years
[13:28.640 --> 13:34.300]  It's like the MacBook Air at m2 like it's taken care of there'll be an m3 MacBook Air almost certainly
[13:34.300 --> 13:36.580]  But it's not gonna look any different because they just did that
[13:36.580 --> 13:41.880]  It's good to go for a while and the iPad Pro is is old and it's fine
[13:41.880 --> 13:47.920]  It was so far ahead when it came out. That's fine. But it is for four cycles through now, I think so
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.360]  Yeah, yeah 2018 right the Brooklyn event right is when they introduced it, right?
[13:52.440 --> 13:58.960]  Which was the same one that had the first retina MacBook Air which was the MacBook Air that?
[13:59.240 --> 14:06.360]  Just got replaced exactly. So the MacBook Air got new hardware. I iPad Pro did not did not
[14:06.800 --> 14:10.620]  Alright, let me start by taking a break here and I will get into the details
[14:10.620 --> 14:13.680]  But I want to talk about our good friends at back blaze
[14:13.680 --> 14:18.400]  Back blaze one of my favorite companies one of my most recommended services
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.400]  they honestly they shouldn't be sponsoring the show because I would tell everybody to
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.600]  Use them anyway
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.260]  But they are sponsoring the show and I'm telling you I use it. I recommend you use it
[14:30.260 --> 14:34.780]  I would recommend you using it. Even if they weren't paying to sponsor the show
[14:34.780 --> 14:40.640]  It is unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs. It costs just seven dollars a month
[14:40.640 --> 14:46.600]  It backs up your documents your music your photos your videos drawings projects all of your data
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.240]  backs it up to their
[14:49.280 --> 14:56.240]  Servers in the cloud off-site out of your facility out of your house. Now. You're backed up files are
[14:56.880 --> 15:00.040]  Available you can get them from iOS and Android apps
[15:00.040 --> 15:05.560]  You can just get like one file like if you're just out and about and you need to get one of your files from your phone
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.160]  Just go to their app. You can get anything that's been backed up right from your phone
[15:09.160 --> 15:16.080]  You want to restore you can do it over the internet if you want, but if catastrophe strikes
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.280]  Computer just absolutely breaks spill water all over it
[15:20.280 --> 15:26.840]  It's shorted out your macbook gets stolen you're lost or something terrible like that happens and you need
[15:27.240 --> 15:32.200]  All of your data back fast. You can get restored by mail not email real mail
[15:32.200 --> 15:37.800]  They'll send you like a flash key or a hard drive with all of your data shipped here
[15:37.800 --> 15:43.560]  door next day delivery, and you can restore from the drive put it on a new machine
[15:44.200 --> 15:47.920]  Copy it over and then you can just send that drive back to them
[15:47.920 --> 15:50.600]  So you're not like on the hook for buying a hard drive
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.400]  You don't need you just send it right back to them within 30 days
[15:53.400 --> 15:57.800]  You get a full refund get your money back for the drive so you can get your data back the next morning
[15:58.520 --> 16:06.520]  Send the drive back and it's just all part of the back play service. That's really just unbelievable now for an extra two bucks
[16:06.520 --> 16:14.280]  A month you can increase your retention history to an entire year so that you can recover files that you've deleted
[16:16.280 --> 16:19.480]  Emptied your trash months go by and
[16:20.040 --> 16:25.560]  Oh my god that file. I deleted a while ago three four months ago. I need to get that file back
[16:25.560 --> 16:30.920]  You can do it for just two more bucks a month to get one year of retention history for your account
[16:30.920 --> 16:36.600]  They have restored over 55 billion files over the years to their customers
[16:36.600 --> 16:43.640]  And you can get a full featured no credit card required trial at backblaze.com
[16:44.840 --> 16:49.320]  The talk show that's backblaze.com the talk show
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.840]  They'll know you came from the show you get that free trial with no credit card required
[16:54.840 --> 17:00.680]  And it's just great also. I would just add it is absolutely terrific mac software
[17:00.680 --> 17:03.960]  Just you install it it brought you don't even know it's running
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.840]  It's never like oh all of a sudden backblaze is doing a backup and everything grinds to a halt on your machine now
[17:08.840 --> 17:12.680]  You just you have no idea that it's running it just boom it's in the cloud
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.760]  You never know it's there. Hopefully you'll never need it, but man you'll even sleep better knowing that your stuff's backed up
[17:18.760 --> 17:20.760]  So my thanks to backblaze
[17:21.240 --> 17:23.240]  One of my favorite sponsors
[17:23.240 --> 17:29.000]  All right, where do we start should we talk apple tv first or do we save it? I mean, that's what everybody's talking about
[17:30.360 --> 17:35.320]  Apple tv 4k maybe we should talk about apple tv 4k first just this is knock it out of the park
[17:35.320 --> 17:41.320]  I will say i'm actually very very happy with all but one aspect of this week's apple tv hardware
[17:42.120 --> 17:48.360]  Number one they have simplified the lineup completely they stopped selling the completely outdated ridiculous
[17:48.360 --> 17:53.720]  1080 version which makes me wonder why they're still calling it apple tv 4k, I guess
[17:54.360 --> 17:59.160]  Because once they started calling the one that does 4k the apple tv 4k
[17:59.800 --> 18:07.160]  And then maybe by calling it apple tv 4k it helps to differentiate it from apple tv the service maybe so yeah
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.480]  And the app that's something
[18:10.600 --> 18:17.000]  So at least for this show I will refer to the hardware as apple tv 4k and they got rid of the other ones right now
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.080]  They're only selling two models. There's a 64 gigabyte model. That is a hundred and thirty dollars
[18:23.720 --> 18:30.200]  129 in apple's parlance i'm rounding up and then for 150 bucks you can get a 128 gigabyte version
[18:30.840 --> 18:31.960]  that
[18:31.960 --> 18:33.080]  adds
[18:33.080 --> 18:38.200]  An ethernet port and this is the part. This is my gripe. It is also the
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.280]  Only the 150 version includes support for the new thread
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.440]  Home automation. I don't know. Would you call it home smart home standard? It's a thread radio
[18:48.440 --> 18:56.360]  So it's part of the it's a thread smart home networking standard basically and i'm i don't know what i'm looking forward
[18:56.360 --> 18:59.720]  To that and this is where I get confused because and I tried to look into it
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.080]  Thread is
[19:03.080 --> 19:06.680]  I don't know what the difference between thread and matter are matter is
[19:07.400 --> 19:12.360]  Do you understand yeah, so some matter is basically a new standard for
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.560]  Device intercommunication that's agreed. It's based on homekit actually, but it's it's an open thing. It's supported by
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.800]  Google and amazon and apple and everybody and the idea is we're not gonna have those wars anymore where it's like
[19:23.800 --> 19:29.080]  Oh, I bought a fan but it only works with alexa and so now I can't use it with my homekit stuff and like
[19:29.080 --> 19:31.080]  That's all gonna go away
[19:31.080 --> 19:36.120]  Thread is a very particular thing thread is a radio and it is
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.840]  Used because not every device wants to be on or needs to be on
[19:40.840 --> 19:58.840]  Wi-Fi, but they do need to talk right if it's a smart home device and you see this a lot historically in all the devices you would buy where you'd have to buy like a little box that you attach to your network via ethernet and plug in and then like I like phillips hugh has those and the lutron casita has one of those
[19:58.840 --> 20:05.880]  Yep, and the idea there is that it's not on your wi-fi network, right? It's got its own little radio network that it's using often more
[20:05.880 --> 20:13.880]  Reliable than your wi-fi to talk to its little devices and go back and forth and act as the middleman with your actual like IP network
[20:14.760 --> 20:24.360]  So thread some of those devices are thread radios like it's and there's like zigbee and there's like a bunch of different things and so thread I believe is the
[20:24.920 --> 20:33.240]  One that everybody sort of agreed is going to be the standard that is used by in the matter world that we're about to enter into for these
[20:33.240 --> 20:49.240]  Communications that are not happening on wi-fi and so that's the idea is you build thread into stuff and it allows you don't have to have a hub with like a thread radio in it, it will do the talking for you and the home pod mini has a thread radio
[20:49.240 --> 20:55.640]  Right, which is kind of interesting. So this is in the and actually the old apple tv 4k hardware had it in it
[20:55.640 --> 21:05.560]  So what really is happening here is they've pulled thread and ethernet out of the apple tv 4k for the lower priced model that 129 model
[21:06.440 --> 21:13.240]  So matter is like the consortium and thread is the wireless protocol from matter
[21:13.240 --> 21:23.000]  A well it's not from matter but it's the one matter uses and it's a wireless protocol right because wi-fi is also a wireless protocol but yeah the idea there is that
[21:23.000 --> 21:41.000]  You have a bunch of devices that I think it's lower power I think it's more reliable I think it might have even have longer range I don't actually know all the details of thread versus wi-fi but that's the idea is they can talk to each other on this thread system
[21:41.000 --> 21:51.000]  And you've got a bunch of devices out there that already support thread radios and so you can talk to them and they don't have to get an ip address and be on your wi-fi instead they kind of like radio back and just say here I am using thread
[21:51.000 --> 22:05.000]  So I have the lutron stuff I think it's caseta because I have the little repeaters I have like two of them I think in the house and we have our lights on lutron and our shades and they work great
[22:05.000 --> 22:31.000]  I would say as a wireless standard it is the most reliable wireless technology I've ever used in my life of and I've got a Euro home network here that I'm very happy with and actually just found out that my original two of my Euro stations are the originals from like when there was only one one Euro base station and they just finally dropped software support for it
[22:31.000 --> 22:49.000]  And you're not going to get software updates so I guess I got to update my network my wi-fi is great and it's really this the having heroes that I have plugged in ethernet around the house have made the group the most reliable wi-fi I've ever had with great performance throughout the house
[22:49.000 --> 23:17.000]  Some bluetooth stuff that I have is starting to get pretty good like my air pods are have been air pods work over bluetooth and have been very reliable for me and I love them they're one of my favorite products that I own period but none of them work as reliably as the lutron stuff I mean I never I've never have rebooted the little repeaters for my stuff ever I've never I don't it's they just run and run and
[23:17.000 --> 23:37.000]  I hate having to install little plastic boxes that use power and are attached to ethernet but I can't argue with the results. So the idea the dream here so I think thread evolved out of Zigbee, which was one of these radio standards but I think that's the idea is you want a more kind of rock solid
[23:37.000 --> 24:06.000]  smart device backhaul that isn't reliant on wi-fi where all your computers are using it something that doesn't need to have that much overhead and that I think thread will also do mesh networking and the idea is that the thread stuff can be put into all sorts of devices like an Apple TV like an Eero I think Eero has that like the home pod mini so that you can talk to all of these devices and they're not hanging around on your wi-fi if they don't have to which is I think actually good for your wi-fi too
[24:06.000 --> 24:30.000]  And you run into problems with these devices as we add more and more devices where it's like how well how do you even get the damn thing on your wi-fi if your wi-fi has a password and I guess thread in addition to just being meant for these small low power devices gets around that too I don't know what the security at you know how do you keep people who walk by your house from screwing around with your thread stuff I don't know but
[24:30.000 --> 24:59.000]  Just like with bluetooth I think there's like some validation that goes into that because right now a lot of these smart home devices get on by bluetooth basically you stand there with your device and running their app and you it says or the bluetooth or wi-fi they make their own like temporary wi-fi network one of those and you basically say here's what my wi-fi network is and here's the password and you send it to it and it says thank you and then it basically reboots attaches to your wi-fi and the setup process continues so I'd imagine it would be pretty similar here but
[24:59.000 --> 25:28.000]  I mean the good news after all this and it's going to be I think it's going to be shaky for a year or more and there's a lot of products that are going to be not quite compatible that are going to be interesting but in the long run I'm so glad that arms race is over right where it's literally like Apple doesn't want to play with Google who doesn't want to play with Amazon and so everybody's products are kind of a Swiss cheese kind of like oh I support this one but not that one and I support this one but not that one it's so frustrating and I think they realize that they were actually going to not be able
[25:28.000 --> 25:44.000]  to sell some of our home products because people got fed up with the incompatibility stuff so I hope that this is all kind of worked out now but it is interesting that then and Apple turns around and says well you don't really need a thread radio in this cheap Apple TV it's fine
[25:44.000 --> 26:13.000]  Well you know it wouldn't be a Jason Snell appearance on the talk show if we don't throw on our old man hats and talk about the 90s but it does remind me of computer networking pre TCP IP taking the title wave that just wiped everything out but this will be bizarre to people who are younger than us but there was a time
[26:13.000 --> 26:36.000]  when all computer networking was proprietary and nothing talked to each other and and the Apple advantage was the same as you'd think it was where it was the easiest where it was local talk and you could just buy things and connect Max together and they saw each other pretty automatically
[26:36.000 --> 26:48.000]  and would show up and would have like normal looking names like your computer Max would have names that had spaces in them and capital letters, and as many characters as you wanted.
[26:48.000 --> 27:02.000]  You know you could set up like a network like at the student newspaper, or something like that and give every Mac, a sensible name, or you could give them playful names like Spock and Kirk and or go Star Wars or something like that, and they just show up but of course
[27:02.000 --> 27:17.000]  if you put a PC on the network had no chance of talking to anything, and vice versa. You couldn't just bring a Mac into a PC environment and there were things like what Nobel, I mean geez there's a company that went away but that was like a career track
[27:17.000 --> 27:33.000]  where you could become a Nobel certified network engineer, and you'd look in the mid 90s you'd look in the one ads, which is how you'd find a job, you'd get the Sunday newspaper.
[27:33.000 --> 27:47.000]  The way you'd find a job is you'd find you'd buy the Sunday newspaper for a new town, which is super thick and would have an entire section that was just not just classified ads but the help wanted ads.
[27:47.000 --> 27:57.000]  And you'd go to the, you're a computer nerd technology section and there'd be all sorts of ads that were required to be a Nobel network certified engineer to take the job.
[27:57.000 --> 28:08.000]  And all of that just, it was a nightmare and there are all sorts of things, other standards remember token ring, there were all these terms and never understood any of that stuff I never understood it either.
[28:08.000 --> 28:20.000]  And then at some point they're like, everybody's doing IP networking, that's what we're doing now, but yeah the my first job at Mac user magazine back in the day we had it was all local talk, we didn't have with file servers and there was Ethernet and all of that
[28:20.000 --> 28:38.000]  but when I started, none of the computers were on the internet, right? You couldn't get to the internet. There was a WAN connection, a wide area network connection, but it was like for our email with the other branches of Ziff Davis.
[28:38.000 --> 28:58.000]  But it was all like they had a line, they probably had like a digital line that went to New York or something, but there was no, there was no internet and I remember when they put in the gateway but like when I started I was still finishing up my grad school at Cal and so I had a dial-up account and I remember very distinctly bringing in my PowerBook and dialing into the internet
[28:58.000 --> 29:12.000]  from my laptop next to my Mac user computer that was not on the internet. That's what it was like. So anyway, are you saying that hopefully when we get through this matter thing everything's going to make more sense and what it's like for the last few years?
[29:12.000 --> 29:30.000]  Yeah, that the interop layer should be open and everybody should just agree to it and it should be good, right? I mean that is a, that sounds obvious but it's a big but, right? I mean there's all sorts of, there have been all sorts of floated standards that are no good
[29:30.000 --> 29:42.000]  and so should be and typically Apple is one of the companies that wouldn't, doesn't want to participate just because it's there and it's a standard and has lots of adherence if it's no good they don't want any part of it. But the way that
[29:42.000 --> 30:00.000]  getting, Wi-Fi is the perfect example, right? The Wi-Fi is just Wi-Fi and yes, it keeps moving forward and there's Wi-Fi 6 and now there's Wi-Fi 6E which only certain devices participate in but on the large part, overall Wi-Fi has been an exemplary open standard, right?
[30:00.000 --> 30:21.000]  Where it keeps evolving, it keeps getting better and if you have a thing, no matter what it is, a computer, a phone, a set-top box that you plug into your TV or a set of lights from Elgato to become a YouTuber and they want to get on your network, it's all just Wi-Fi, right?
[30:21.000 --> 30:45.000]  Your Wi-Fi is my Wi-Fi and as long as the number of your Wi-Fi is compatible, stuff just works, right? Something like that for home networking seems just what the doctor ordered and I guess it's, hopefully it was inevitable but yeah, you're right though that like when you're like buying, oh, I just want to buy, we bought them a couple years ago because as people may know who follow me and my wife on Twitter, my wife likes to have multiple Christmas trees, God help me.
[30:45.000 --> 31:12.000]  So a smart socket for Christmas tree lights so you can just tell one of your dinguses to turn on all the Christmas tree lights or turn them off as you're leaving the house or going to bed is an enormous convenience and it used to be you'd go shopping and you'd see this one works with Alexa, this one works with Apple HomeKit but you can't find one that works with both and it's like, why? This is ridiculous so hopefully that's over.
[31:12.000 --> 31:26.000]  And theoretically, I had Mike Hurley on upgrade a couple weeks ago walk me through a nice explainer article actually that I think The Verge did about Matter but one of the things that there's stuff in there that is if it works is even better, right?
[31:26.000 --> 31:44.000]  Like it's the idea that you can use the app that comes with it or you can use your preference preferential app and then you can sort of like pick and also they have the idea that there are like matter clients and matter controllers and some of the stuff this is all supposed to not be things that regular people need to work but on the back end.
[31:44.000 --> 32:11.000]  It has things like the idea that they did the devices matter devices can talk to each other which really opens a lot of potential because for example, the dream is if you have a if you have a device that like when this device gets activated do something on another device with HomeKit the HomeKit hub sits there sees that the status of one device has changed and then tells the other device to change in the ideal matter set up.
[32:11.000 --> 32:29.000]  The one device either sees that the other devices change directly or the that first device tells the other device because it knows it's watching I just changed and then it changes and there's no middleman required for that sort of thing all the devices sort of know to talk to each other.
[32:29.000 --> 32:42.000]  And again, how will this work in practice who knows but it sounds like it could be really cool and like a much better system of managing these things then we've had up to now so I hope that's what happens.
[32:42.000 --> 32:59.000]  What do you think can you explain why you would want to have a home hub like a hundred fifty dollar Apple TV 4K or a HomePod mini that has thread support what is the advantage of having such a thing in your house.
[32:59.000 --> 33:13.000]  Yeah, I think the idea is that you need something with a thread radio to get that stuff on the to talk to it from your other devices whether they're on your local network or whether you're over the internet somewhere so somebody has to channel between them.
[33:13.000 --> 33:35.000]  So ideally if you've got some device in your home that is a thread radio in it that's also on Wi-Fi it can be the one to channel that stuff and if you don't have that then you probably have to buy one of those little dinguses that that talks that's like a standalone thing but that's why they want to embed thread radios in a bunch of stuff like your hero or your HomePod or your Apple TV so that it can be the guiding light there.
[33:35.000 --> 33:54.000]  But yeah that's the idea is that ideally you wouldn't I think the ideal is that you wouldn't have a single point of failure so that if your Apple TV gets in a weird state your because this has happened to me Apple TV gets in a weird state and suddenly none of my smart home stuff works because it was acting as the hub and like that's no good right.
[33:54.000 --> 34:13.000]  So in theory they're talking to each other there there there's redundancy there and things don't all fall apart if your hub dies but again this is all like matter doesn't launch for another couple of weeks and then there's going to be a process after that but I'm at least optimistic that it's going to be a better situation than we're in now.
[34:13.000 --> 34:37.000]  Right it's like it's not a bad thing to get a 5G compatible device before 5G is totally rolled out because 5G's got legs and two years down the road it's better off like for example our home security panel the thing that you type the numbers on when we first got the house it was it was I think it was 3G.
[34:37.000 --> 35:01.000]  It has anyway it has cellular backup just in case like the Wi-Fi goes out so we can still communicate and we had to forget I don't even think we had to pay but they had to come and replace it last summer because the 3G network was going going away so they updated it to a new thing so it's always better to get something with the future ahead of it even if it's not there's not a compelling story now.
[35:01.000 --> 35:30.000]  I just think overall though it's the Ethernet port that seems like something you pay 20 bucks for thread support boy I mean if it's real I mean if it's really in a $5 component or something I guess it makes sense that it's part of the $20 upgrade but I don't know that just seems really annoying to me it just seems like if you like if the story was if you have a product called Apple TV 4k you've got a thread compatible home hub that is so much simpler than.
[35:30.000 --> 35:50.000]  Did you buy the more expensive one right right or do you have another do you have another do you have a home pod mini do you have any Euro do you have some other thread radio somewhere and then you have to walk through that whole thing and then if you find out you don't and you bought the 129 Apple TV like oh man what do you what do I do now do I buy some other.
[35:50.000 --> 36:05.000]  Well especially said and and again the Ethernet could be I think for a lot of people I have Ethernet throughout my house but I actually don't have my Apple TV on Ethernet because I have terrific Wi-Fi in the living room and it's actually I don't have the Ethernet in the.
[36:05.000 --> 36:21.000]  The place where I hide all the boxes like the TiVo and the Apple TV and I'm sure a lot of people are like that too if you have really solid Wi-Fi where you're going to put your Apple TV why wire it if it's or if you don't have an Ethernet Jack where you want to put it even if your Wi-Fi is not ideal.
[36:21.000 --> 36:36.000]  A lot of people might look at it and say well I definitely I don't need the storage I have no I don't I never store anything on my Apple TV and I don't use Ethernet so why not save 20 bucks and I could see that and I don't know what threat is I've never heard of it.
[36:36.000 --> 36:54.000]  So I could see people buying the $130 one for very reasonable reasons and coming to regret it a year or two and from now when thread is more of a big deal and they're like ah crap I don't have anything else I don't know so that's the one thing I'm a little annoyed by.
[36:54.000 --> 37:06.000]  And of course I saved the best for last. The remote control now has USB-C instead of lightning.
[37:06.000 --> 37:19.000]  This to me is big news not because it is a particularly big deal how one charges a remote control that me as a daily user of Apple TV seemingly only charges like once a year.
[37:19.000 --> 37:30.000]  I think weeks go by it's definitely several months and I use it every day as well it's my primary device is an Apple TV for all my entertainment and weeks if not months go by.
[37:30.000 --> 37:47.000]  Definitely months, months for me. So it's not that it needs to charge at a particularly high rate of speed but it is the fact that switching something like that from lightning to USB-C has been the canary in the coal mine I've been waiting for as the okay
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  for sure iPhone is going to USB-C.
[37:52.000 --> 38:01.000]  All lightning stuff is leaving. This is one of the first indications this and that iPad really are good indications that lightning is being beaten out of the product line.
[38:01.000 --> 38:29.000]  And the one that had me going hmm maybe not was last month with the new AirPods Pro 2 the case was still lightning and that was it the ones that to me were are going to be the tell are the not the computers but the peripherals things like the remote control for Apple TV.
[38:29.000 --> 38:46.000]  AirPods cases trackpad and mouse right trackpad and mouse trying to think what else there is that Apple has that charges by lightning the trackpad mouse and keyboard the AirPods cases control and waiting for them to change to me was a tell.
[38:46.000 --> 39:02.000]  So I think that the reason the AirPods case didn't but the remote did is that Apple doesn't update the Apple TV every year. And so this is going to be the Apple TV for I would guess at least two years, possibly three.
[39:02.000 --> 39:31.000]  And so they want that this is a remote control that's going to be on sale for years to come. I think that with AirPods they see obviously AirPods work with all of your Apple devices and in fact as Bluetooth headphones they work with other devices to you compare them with an Android phone or a PC or anything that could use Bluetooth headphones, but I think that Apple sees the iPhone as the primary.
[39:31.000 --> 39:47.000]  Server of audio to AirPods and I don't think it's a coincidence that it was the iPhone event where they unveiled the AirPods 2 Pro 2 and as so I think so long as the iPhones are on lightning.
[39:47.000 --> 40:10.000]  They want to keep the AirPod cases on lightning and if let's just say as a lot of people expect including me next September the iPhones 15 have light or USB C ports or maybe just the 15 Pro as lightning or I mean USB C and the regular 15 still has lightning.
[40:10.000 --> 40:27.000]  Then they'll just silently start shipping AirPods 2 cases that have a USB C port instead of lightning, even though they're still the AirPods Pro second generation, they'll just change the case without changing the AirPods.
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  And those of us who bought them a year early can either curse ourselves or just charge them with MagSafe if they don't want to carry lightning cables around.
[40:36.000 --> 40:45.000]  Exactly right and it'll all turn over. Yeah, also that's an easy one, right? Because it's not even the product that you have to modify. It's the case and they already did that when they add a wireless charging to the AirPods case.
[40:45.000 --> 40:56.000]  They can take keep AirPods Pro 2 exactly as they are and just drop into the production line a new version of the case that has USB C instead and no one will even notice.
[40:56.000 --> 41:08.000]  No, I'd say the only disappointing thing I have about that the remote is that I really was hoping that they would put one wideband thing in there like it's in the AirPods case so that you can find it.
[41:08.000 --> 41:20.000]  Or maybe even a speaker like in the AirPods case. I'm sure it's an issue of battery life and the thinness of that little aluminum thing and that like the AirPods Pro, they didn't really want to redesign the whole enclosure.
[41:20.000 --> 41:30.000]  They just did as little as they possibly could, but that's the thing that I lose. I just typed in our shared note, remote colon USB C and no Find My.
[41:30.000 --> 41:41.000]  Yeah, and it was funny because over the weekend, Amy and I, I don't know whose fault it was, although it wasn't mine, but the remote control got lost.
[41:41.000 --> 41:52.000]  And I said to her, you know, I don't think this will be a problem starting next week because they're coming out with a new Apple TV and I'll bet that the remote has Find My support.
[41:52.000 --> 41:58.000]  And she was like, why didn't they do that last time? And I said, I can tell you don't listen to my podcast.
[41:58.000 --> 42:17.000]  I've been asking that ever since it came out and yet here we are and still no Find My. And it's very strange, especially since they make the damn thing as small and thin and you can have a sofa with the tightest tolerance between the cushions that a comfortable sofa can have.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  And the Apple TV is seemingly designed to slip right through them.
[42:23.000 --> 42:36.000]  Yep. Slide right in there. That's another, I guess, annoyance. But because I boy that really seems it just seems like it is the one thing that I misplaced the most, you know, and because every once in a while it's not in a sofa cushion.
[42:36.000 --> 42:44.000]  It's like and this was my move. I will admit my move is to just have it in hand as I get up and go to the kitchen to get some snacks or something.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  That's my number one move is like where where is it? Where is it? Oh, it's laying on the counter in the kitchen.
[42:49.000 --> 43:03.000]  Right. Because I took it out in one hand and then realized I was doing something that, you know, like getting a bottle that needs to be opened with two hands and put it down and poured a thing and brought some pirate booty out or whatever the snack the evening is.
[43:03.000 --> 43:15.000]  And where the hell's the remote? I left it in the other room. Would boy that would be nice to have, but we don't. Otherwise, though, I don't really have any complaints about the remote. It's I'm used to it. I like it.
[43:15.000 --> 43:32.000]  Still not sure I would have put the buttons in the order that they put them. But yeah, but I've gotten acclimated to it overall. I know some people complain about the side button that they hit the site, the one that you do to talk to the to the device, but I don't hit it accidentally.
[43:32.000 --> 43:46.000]  So I do sometimes, but it's not enough again. I don't love my big problem with it is that although I really do like having that touch surface on the button, there are times when I just try to press the button and it thinks that I'm swiping.
[43:46.000 --> 43:55.000]  And so I end up in a different clicking the wrong thing that that it's a tricky thing. And then also they introduce that whole idea of like touching and holding on the ring and doing like a scrub.
[43:55.000 --> 44:08.000]  And that seems to be something that everybody's just given up on that they're gonna do that gesture at all. So it's but it's usable in a way that the old one was less usable. And while I think that they could probably do an even better one.
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  At some point, it sure doesn't with this USB C change. It sure doesn't seem like they're gonna anytime soon.
[44:14.000 --> 44:28.000]  Yeah, what do you think about the pricing? I know that's been a years long source of complaint, right? These other companies sell these fire sticks and Roku's is how you pronounce it that are I don't know 60 bucks or something like that or less.
[44:28.000 --> 44:36.000]  But you know, let's say for decent 4k support half the price. I think these prices are much more in line with what Apple TV should be.
[44:36.000 --> 44:49.000]  Yeah, yeah, it's funny. A lot of it because there was a market share argument, right, which is never what you should really make with Apple, which is there's a $50 $30 4k stick so Apple should do that.
[44:49.000 --> 45:03.000]  But the thing about their sort of years long process of getting Apple TV stuff into TVs and onto streaming boxes, and it's basically everywhere if you buy a new something, it will almost certainly support Apple's TV stuff.
[45:03.000 --> 45:17.000]  Well, that eliminates it as an issue. So all you're left with is the Apple TV is more expensive because it's a better if not premium a better experience than a low end streaming stick.
[45:17.000 --> 45:25.000]  The interface is nicer, and it's faster and more responsive. And I think both of those are true to a point like I think it should be better.
[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  I don't think Apple TV is good enough. I think that it has some serious interface problems in some areas and the fact that tv OS just got updated and nothing changed gives me some hesitation.
[45:35.000 --> 45:50.000]  Amazon recently did a UI refresh that is is it really nice but also having I've got a Roku a low end Roku box a low end fire stick about a low end Roku box for my mom I can tell you those cheap boxes are bad.
[45:50.000 --> 45:59.000]  They work, but they are slow the interfaces are clunky, but they work right. And when I use my Apple TV I'm like, it's really nice.
[45:59.000 --> 46:11.000]  And that's that. Again, I think Apple has a lot more work to do on the interface Joe Rosen steel has written about it at length on his own blog and on six colors and like all over the place like, and he's right.
[46:11.000 --> 46:24.000]  There are lots of things that Apple is not doing well enough and Apple's entry into sports I think might be the thing that finally spurs them to do better because they don't handle a lot of stuff like what's on right now what can I watch right now.
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.000]  They have some of that but it's not really well designed and I think that they're a little still a little too app centric.
[46:30.000 --> 46:56.000]  But all that said I can see the Apple TV hardware now in a way that it makes more sense as an Apple product which is it's nicer like in the end you're paying more because it's nicer because it's got a faster processor and a nicer remote and everything is smooth and you don't have to wait every time you click for another thing to load which is what happens on my mom's Roku because it was 20 bucks at Walmart.
[46:56.000 --> 47:07.000]  And the great thing about it. It was 20 bucks at Walmart. The bad thing about it is it's not very good and the Amazon stuff is nice, but it's also full of commercial garbage because it's Amazon and they're trying to sell you stuff.
[47:07.000 --> 47:31.000]  So it is a much better argument to make that yes Apple TV cost more not as much as it did but still cost more than the competition but you get something that's nicer and a lot of people will point out also that Apple is not as likely to be tracking your movements and habits as something like Roku or even Amazon or Google.
[47:31.000 --> 47:42.000]  So like that that right that feels a lot better to say at what's Apple TV doing at 129 and the answer is it you pay more but it's nicer like that's a very Apple approach.
[47:42.000 --> 47:59.000]  I think yeah, I agree and as much you know, you probably are getting tracked in a lot. In fact, I know you're getting tracked a lot of ways within the apps you use right and that you go into Hulu and Hulu is tracking whatever you've watched and I'm sure they're taking all the
[47:59.000 --> 48:09.000]  metrics you want but at least you know, you're only doing that because you're choosing to use Hulu at the system at the system level. There's no tracking and I don't think anybody else can say that right.
[48:09.000 --> 48:22.000]  I mean you can I have I mean I have a Roku TV and you can opt out of a bunch of stuff and people have done network traffic analysis and I think that some of that like it's all spying on you is a little overblown but not entirely overblown right.
[48:22.000 --> 48:32.000]  This is one of those cases where if you're like, I don't like the idea that I'm buying a cheap box that's being subsidized by either Amazon's commercial efforts or having something that's running all the time.
[48:32.000 --> 48:41.000]  It's analyzing everything I do and that makes me uncomfortable put that on the pile of reasons to get an Apple TV, but it is but you're not going to you're not going to get an Apple TV for 20 bucks at Walmart.
[48:41.000 --> 48:59.000]  You're not well and I think you're and I but I think you're exactly right to that the lower end sub hundred dollar things that you plug in whether they're a stick or a box. They're all getting eaten by the built-in stuff that's built into TVs and as slow as the upgrade cycle is for replacing actual TVs.
[48:59.000 --> 49:20.000]  It's at the point now where it you can definitely see I see from extended family members how it's eaten into it where it five six seven eight year even a 10-year upgrade cycle for TVs is a long period of time, but it does happen and there I don't see the room for $50.
[49:20.000 --> 49:36.000]  This is the plug in the TV when the it they're no better than the one that's built in and you already you know, so why do it so I have a TCL 4K HDR TV. It's great and it's a Roku TV and you know it you buy you buy any of these things.
[49:36.000 --> 50:03.000]  You're going to get something that is yes. It is a cut above like my mom's Roku box for 25 bucks. Whatever it was at Walmart like the one embedded in my TV is way better like so so yes, and then it's I'm going to have it for whatever five or 10 years and and and it'll get older but like so many people are going to buy a new TV and then throw their box away because those cheap cheap streamer boxes aren't or they're there just to enable my mom's got a plasma TV.
[50:03.000 --> 50:26.000]  It doesn't have any streaming support whatever. So that's why I bought her that Roku box and everybody out there is now going to say Jason. Why aren't you giving her an Apple TV and it's like all right. You're probably right. I probably should I'm going to have to find a spare Apple TV and and give it to her but but yeah that that is that that stuff's all going away right because if she got another TV today, she wouldn't need a box.
[50:26.000 --> 50:38.000]  It would be the TV's the TV's got it and that and that may leaves once again leaves Apple in this position is the sort of like but if you want something nicer, which you know is quintessential Apple right?
[50:38.000 --> 50:56.000]  All right, let's take a break here and I'm going to tell you about another great company one that is fueled this podcast to some extent it's trade coffee. Look whether if you make coffee at home and you've been getting your coffee from the grocery store and drinking the exact same coffee every day.
[50:56.000 --> 51:08.000]  You could try something much better with trade coffee. It is so easy to get fresh roasted coffee. It's delivered right to your doorstep from local Roasters all around the United States.
[51:08.000 --> 51:30.000]  That's what trade does they are a coffee subscription service and they make it so simple for you to discover new coffees and get it delivered at the pace and quantity that you want for how much coffee you and your family or your colleagues if it's for work drink and make great cups of coffee great pots of coffee at home at work every day.
[51:30.000 --> 51:53.000]  No fancy equipment. It is just coffee. I drink I make coffee every day that I'm home for myself whole bean coffee. I grind it fresh right before I make it but having different coffee slightly different coffee in a flavor profile that you like every two weeks is great because I taste the difference and it doesn't get so monotonous where you get like some variety into your coffee.
[51:53.000 --> 52:02.000]  But the main thing the main reason to sign up for a subscription service from trade and get this fresh coffee is that coffee is a produce it goes bad.
[52:02.000 --> 52:25.000]  So when you buy it at like a grocery store off the shelf it is already probably stale or on its way to being stale whereas when you get coffee through trade it gets roasted fresh at local Roasters all around the country and packaged sealed and sent to you and you've got it within days just a handful of days of when it was roasted.
[52:25.000 --> 52:48.000]  That's when you get it you open it up and it is fresh and once you know this and once you start tasting it is the single biggest difference in coffee that you can make not like what country the beans are from or which Roaster or how even how much it's roasted but fresh coffee versus stale coffee is the biggest difference that that you know that I can taste for sure and trade coffee is just terrific for it.
[52:48.000 --> 53:07.000]  They have so many Roasters so many varieties and it's just a great service and you really can you you can just dial in the exact amount of coffee that you want and just take a guess if you're just getting started and haven't done it before if you just say every two weeks and then you find out that like after 10 days you're out of coffee.
[53:07.000 --> 53:29.000]  You can just adjust it and get it every week or you can get it every week and a half or something like that you're going away you're going on vacation you just go to the website and click a thing and just skip a shipment or you can pause it for an extended period of time if you want to and then restore so that you don't come home from vacation and have three packages of coffee just sitting there waiting for you with a new one on its way.
[53:29.000 --> 53:45.000]  It is so super convenient and they really really help you find the type of coffee that you like and once you start getting coffee that you like and you rate it on their site you start getting more coffee it's like a recommendation profile and you it really does work the coffee I'm getting from trade now.
[53:45.000 --> 53:53.000]  I enjoy more than what I started months ago and I like the coffee I got at the start it's really just a great service.
[53:53.000 --> 54:08.000]  I highly recommend it I drank it today as I've been doing for months you can upgrade your coffee right now with trade and they are offering listeners of this show a total of $30 off your subscription plus free shipping.
[54:08.000 --> 54:31.000]  By going to drink trade.com slash the talk show that's drink trade.com slash the talk show for $30 off your subscription to the best coffees in the country drink trade.com slash the talk show alright time for iPads I guess we'll go from the bottom sorry Apple TV fans were done.
[54:31.000 --> 54:51.000]  So the 10th generation iPad does the new one does not replace the 9th generation because the price is higher right you can get a 9th generation one that starts at 329 and the new one starts at 449 that's it that's not a minor difference that's a worth keeping the old one around difference.
[54:51.000 --> 55:04.000]  That's over a hundred bucks yeah and like the MacBook Air it feel keeping the M1 MacBook Air around it feels very much like they know that they've got not only generally in public but probably institutionally in especially education but maybe even in businesses too.
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.000]  They've got customers who will not accept 1199 MacBook Air will not accept 449 iPad.
[55:10.000 --> 55:21.000]  So what do you do well your modern Apple you just keep the old one around and introduce your new one at a higher price point which is why I've been thinking of this 10th generation iPad as.
[55:21.000 --> 55:37.000]  The education iPad of 2024 right like it'll get there it'll come down in price eventually but right now the education iPad is the iPad 9 because it's still in the line at 329 and it's $120 cheaper.
[55:37.000 --> 56:00.000]  In a way I'm thinking of the iPad 9 as the iPad se without ever actually calling anything the iPad se but it actually fits the exact role that the Apple watch se has fit and of course more the best known se the iPhone se models where it's old hardware design.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  But good enough to recommend to people it's a fine product.
[56:04.000 --> 56:15.000]  It's not like Apple watch series 3 was for the last year where everybody who kind of had any kind of formed opinion about Apple watch would tell people don't buy that.
[56:15.000 --> 56:24.000]  Yes I know that price tag is appealing and you may not understand the differences but you should buy the Apple watch se for more money instead of buying that series 3.
[56:24.000 --> 56:32.000]  The iPad 9th generation isn't like that at all you know if you think of it as the iPad se then I think the lineup makes total sense.
[56:32.000 --> 56:47.000]  Well in the iPad 10th generation what's interesting is if you were to envision a product that was between the 9th generation and the Air it would be the iPad 10th generation.
[56:47.000 --> 56:58.000]  What's interesting about it is like what they chose to upgrade and what they chose to not upgrade I think that's kind of fascinating because it's got it doesn't have a laminated screen like the iPad Air.
[56:58.000 --> 57:10.000]  It doesn't support the pencil to like the iPad Air like it's got a bunch of things about it doesn't support the smart keyboard it doesn't do windowing on display right using stage manager it can't do that.
[57:10.000 --> 57:25.000]  There are all sorts of things that the iPad Air still does but the iPad 10th generation has evolved over the 9th generation in moving touch ID to the sleep button and having a keyboard that has a trackpad on it.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  And getting away from the home button.
[57:29.000 --> 57:51.000]  Which I think makes it feel much more modern even though like the Air right it doesn't have face ID but just having it be Apple calls it like borderless or full screen or whatever is still quite a large border around it but it's consistent around the whole thing and there isn't a big space at the bottom where there's a home button so it feels more like a modern iPad by putting it in the button.
[57:51.000 --> 58:16.000]  Yeah it just looks more modern I mean we've been moving towards this ever since the iPhone 10 which first introduced this new design language where coincident with getting rid of a chin and a forehead and a square cornered rectangular screen and a home button whether or not the home button has touch ID or not but just that classic iPhone from 2007 fundamental design.
[58:16.000 --> 58:30.000]  It's I you know it shows how long these transitions can be right because the iPhone 10 was like 2017 right at my right or is it 2016 I don't know it's at least five or six years I guess five years ago yeah.
[58:30.000 --> 58:54.000]  So now it's finally trickled down throughout the whole iPad lineup to I mean there still is the iPad 9th generation and there still is the iPhone SE so that we're not totally out of it yet as relevant products that Apple continues to sell but the light at the end of the tunnel of okay the home button is gone is clearly on the horizon.
[58:54.000 --> 59:23.000]  Yeah yeah for sure so it's a modernization of the iPad and that's great but they have had to keep the old one around because this is obviously not a product that is targeted at 329 but it's curious because among its upgrades is not just it's such a weird product because like there's this new case that is using the smart connector on the side and unlike they didn't upgrade the smart connector to the back like the air which means that they can't use the magic keyboard that they make that's the cantilevered thing.
[59:23.000 --> 59:38.000]  That's got the trackpad and the keyboard they kept the smart connector on the side that used to be remember it was originally the iPad Pro smart connector and it came down to all models and this is the last one other than the iPad 9 that still has it on the side.
[59:38.000 --> 59:55.000]  But as a result they've got a two-piece keyboard thing that's very different from the magic keyboard and it's got a kickstand and it isn't backlit but it does have the same key switches and it's got a function row which everybody complained that the magic keyboard for iPad Pro did not have.
[59:55.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's got it that's another great sign and they moved the FaceTime camera so that it's in the center that's great and then they moved it to USB-C because that's the way things are going that's great and then they said yeah we can't find a place for the Apple Pencil 2 so we made this plastic tonkle you can use with the original Apple Pencil.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  It's like what huh like the choices I'm sure there's a whole story there that we'll never hear about why they made that choice but it's so strange right so it's like they're advancing the platform over here and then it's like not you Apple Pencil not you.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  So you went to I presume Cupertino for briefings I went to New York last week and we have the hardware we've been testing you know by the time this podcast airs the embargo will be up so we can talk about it.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I've got these things this is what I was joking about at the outset of the show in front of me and you go to get these briefings you get the chance to ask questions you don't necessarily get the chance to get answers to your questions.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  No, but this was a briefing where there were a lot of questions.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Yeah, and the why does it still use Apple Pencil 1 question I was anticipating getting a total non answer from and my guess was and I do think this is a factor that the connector technology inside the iPads for Pencil 2 is expensive or expensive enough that
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  for these, you know what, why is this iPad $150 less than the same amount of storage in an iPad Air, which does support pencil to that's part of the explanation, right, m one versus an a 14 chip is certainly part of it.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  The laminated screen, this that the other thing does add up and you can say side by side at a glance, this looks just like the iPad Air so I don't see why anybody would spend $150 more on the iPad Air, but you don't have to spend long looking at the comparison
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  aspects to see Oh well there's this and there's this and there's this, and the pencil to support hardware inside the iPad Air and the iPad pros is harder to see than things like Oh laminated screen once you look for it you can I can definitely see it, you can definitely
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  see that the screen isn't as nice, and that you can see that there's like a gap there under the pixels or further from the surface, it's thicker, it's a slightly thicker device, and when they're side by side you can definitely tell that hardware
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  for. It's not just magnets to snap, snap, I'm sure the magnets are the cheapest part of it, but the actual technology that wirelessly pairs and charges. The pencil to when it's attached to an iPad Air or iPad Pro that has a cost, and presumably this device
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  is eventually going to cost 329 right they're going to eventually that iPad ninth gen is going to go away and this will be the entry level iPad at 330 price or something like that or 350 maybe with inflation I don't know, but, you know, they're going to knock
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  $100 off this at some point so it's been I think it's built for that going forward. I think that's a reason maybe it is the reason. But the other answer I got I don't know, did you get any answers from this the other answer I got is that there are zillion
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Apple pencil ones out there in institutions in education, especially in education, especially, and that those institutions that bought and still have been buying the lightning, like nine, the iPad ninth gen that use those pencils are doing it for
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  cost reasons that education famously needs the budgets aren't great and schools.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  And so the, if they're buying 300 $400 let's just say $400 iPads $99 pencils, that's a 25% that's the combined cost is now $500 right and 20% of the cost of the device is the pencil.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  That's a significant investment to them. And those are the people who are going to buy this iPad because the budget still matters. And if they can reuse the pencils they already have that's a significant part of the expenditure for buying these iPads,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  compared to people who have, let's say $1,000 $1,100 $1,200 $900 budget for an iPad Pro or a high end iPad Air. If you need to buy a new $99 pencil, sure it's still 100 bucks but you're in a you're in a stratosphere where your overall budget can absorb
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  an extra $99 in a way that someone whose budget $400 is grit your teeth, just for the 400 bucks. It makes a big difference.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  Yeah, I understand that I think that I was thinking this week about the EMAC Do you remember the EMAC, it was a, they didn't make a G4 iMac it with a CRT, but they made this thing called the EMAC that was basically a G4 iMac with a CRT.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  The reason they made it was education, it's because the edge, it's the same reason why there was an iMac for years that was like $1,000 that had a spinning disk and an optical drive and like all these things that Apple had given up on, but they made.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  What I'm saying is Apple makes a lot of weird decisions, because we aren't in touch with who the institutional buyers are and what they want. And there's somebody inside Apple who says, you can't do this, because you don't understand how many people buy this.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  And so Pencil One, I get it. I think that's not a bad excuse. I wonder if there might have been other ways to mitigate that, but that they would have been too, in the end, I think the answer is they would have been too expensive to put in this low end iPad hardware.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Like you could be compatible with both, but they chose not to do that. So we end up in the situation where lightning.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Also, I gotta say, this is like the chickens coming home to roost, right? The design decision Apple made in 2018 with the iPad Pro having the magnetic attachment, which is so great for the Pencil Two. Love that Pencil Two.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  But that means that if you want to make an iPad that supports Pencil Two, you have to do the magnetic with the induction charging. You gotta do it. Otherwise, you can't support that one.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  And the design decision they made with the original Pencil, which I think at the time we all scratched our heads about a little bit, which is, well, there's a little plastic cap, and then there's like a lightning nub underneath.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  And you can plug it into the bottom of an iPad, which is super awkward and weird, but you can do it. It always felt like it was going to break off when I would do it. Like, maybe very uncomfortable.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Well, now they're in a situation where they're like, well, what do we do? We can't use that. And we can't really use that. And somebody was like, well, okay, let's make a $9 adapter that you plug a pencil in on one side and a USB cable in on another because it's too long.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  There's too much torque. There's too long. You would literally snap it off if you had a USB-C sticking out of it. So instead, it's just a receptacle for a cable to get plugged in.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  And Apple knew going in that everybody was going to laugh at it. And it is kind of embarrassing. Like, I totally get why they might want to do it. But it is a logical progression when you consider all the other decisions they made.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  But really, they painted themselves in a corner where they're like, I guess this is what we have to do now because they didn't want to do it. But I think whatever in-device option they might have had in that iPad, all their choices were probably pushed the price up or the margins down, depending on how you want to look at it. And they decided, nope, $9 adapter it is.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Right. And it's like, why do you have paint all over the skin of your feet? And it's because, well, I painted myself in a corner and I figured out the best solution was to take off my shoes and socks and just walk across the floor with my bare feet because I can wash those.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  And I thought if I got paint on the bottoms of my shoes, I'd never get it off. And so now my shoes are fine, but I just need to take a shower and scrub my feet. And it was the best I could do.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  I also think that we talk about their future plans. I suspect there's a Pencil 3 in the works. And when they looked at this, they're like, we're not going to put any effort into doing a new pencil right now because we're already working on a new pencil.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  Because they could have made a Pencil 1.5 that uses USB-C. They could have knocked off or even bought or worked with Logitech because Logitech has that product that they've had since the very beginning of the Apple Pencil called the Crayon.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  They've been working with them since 2018, since that Chicago event. So it doesn't do the pressure sensitivity, but it's proximity based. You just bring it near an iPad and it works and you can draw on it.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  And they made a new USB-C version, but it doesn't really matter. You can use either version. And there are lots of things they could have done to make this easier.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  But I think in the end, they looked at it and said, we're not investing more time in old pencil, low-end pencil compatibility. We're just not going to do it. You can have a little plastic thing.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Yeah, I never bought the Logitech Crayon, but I'm thinking about buying the new one. So the new one that they announced coincident with last week's announcement is USB-C for charging.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  But because I don't have one, I don't know how you pair it. Do you pair it with a cable or do you pair it wirelessly?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  It's adorable. Think, believe it or not, and it's been a little while. I don't know where mine is. I need to fish it out. Mine is the original, so it's like orange.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Battery's probably dead. It probably doesn't work anymore. But I believe you don't pair it. I believe that it works entirely based on proximity.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  You just bring it near an iPad and it starts working.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  And then it starts to work with that iPad.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  And then if you turn and use a different iPad, it just works with that one.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Yeah, it's a really interesting product, and I think people don't know about it. But again, not as capable as an Apple Pencil, but I think the whole idea there was to make a more affordable stylus for iPads for education.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  And if you think about it in an educational context, you could have a bunch of those Crayons and a bunch of iPads and you don't have to worry about pairing or anything because it's all proximity-based.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Right. And as easy as it is to repair a pencil from iPad A to iPad B, so long as the two iPads share Pencil 1 or Pencil 2 compatibility, just by attaching Pencil 2 magnetically, it suddenly changes from being paired with A to B or just plugging the lightning plug into the socket on a home button iPad just pairs the iPad or the pencil with it.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Not having to pair at all is even easier, right? And again, like you said, in a classroom situation where everybody picks up an iPad and you don't have to worry that you've got iPad A37 with Pencil A37 because they're the ones that are paired together.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  Especially now that if you want to pair that Pencil 1, you've got to get the adapter and the cable and the whole thing to do that.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  The adapter is $9, which is Apple's price for shit that they wish they could just give away, right? I forget what else has cost $9 over the years.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I think the AirPods ear tips cost $9.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  The headphone to lightning adapter, when they first got rid of the headphone jack, was $9. I'm not sure if it still is.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  The USB headphone adapter, I think, is that too. $9 is the, like, I can't charge any less than this price.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Good for them.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  My understanding is they're going to put it in the box of all new Apple Pencil 1s that are being sold.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  Right. I asked because in our review kit, or at least my review kit, they gave me a new Pencil 1, which is, I don't know how many of them now are floating around my house.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  My old one battery died, so I was glad they sent one this time.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Oh, like it wouldn't even take a charge.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  It won't charge. I left it dead for too long, I think, and it won't charge now.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  They sent me a Pencil 1 and the standalone little adorable little box for the adapter.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  And so I asked, because they did tell me at the briefing that going forward, all Pencil 1 purchases included.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  I was like, is it always going to be two separate boxes? And they're like, no, it will eventually be in the box with the pencil.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  It's just that the, you know, right now to give us stuff, they don't have those yet. So they just gave us the two boxes.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  The adapter, it is awkward. I mean, the biggest problem to me isn't the $9 if you need to buy it.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  It's the loseability. And to me, that's the single biggest design mistake with Pencil 1 is the cap, because the caps are so easily loseable.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  There's nowhere to put it when you take it off. While it was my Apple Pencil, I lost the cap.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  I did lose, and I don't lose things typically. I'm pretty good at not losing like even fiddly little things, but I lost the caps.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And I also thought, what the hell? Why do I even care about the cap?
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  The lightning, the male lightning jack at the end of the pencil, I guess it looks better with the cap on, but I think the design would have been better.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  I don't know. I'm sure they considered it, but I think it would have been better if it was retractable, if it was like the way that a click pen goes in and out.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  What if the lightning clicked in and out so that you could tuck it away so it's not sticking out, but it went away?
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  The cap was a terrible idea. It really, in my opinion.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Yeah, and I totally get why they had it be jack, because it is such a, even though it's awkward and weird, you don't need to find a cable, right?
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  You just plug it into the bottom of your iPad, and it pairs and it charges, and you've got it going.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Well, and the other problem with lightning is there's never been such a thing as a lightning to lightning cable with male lightning on both ends.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  Right. Well, they actually had a little adapter in the box to do that, I think, because I had one.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  So you could charge it independently, but it was not meant to do that.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  I mean, because the counterargument could be maybe they could have just made a lightning port on it.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  Right. But then you'd need a cable every time.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Now, ironically, now with this new iPad, the result of that design decision is now you do need a cable and an adapter in order to get it to work.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  It's so funny. The adapter, if you didn't notice, I'll put a link in the show notes to it, I promise, but if you look at the little picture,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  they show the picture on the lightning side, so it's female to female.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  It is a female USB on one side, female lightning on the other.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  And you can tell which is which if you know that USB-C sockets are actually the male part of USB-C.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  There's like a little thing that sticks out in the center.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  You can just look in the USB-C port and you can see what I'm talking about.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  So you can tell, but they also put just a little circle on the lightning end on the one side.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Like there is no logo for lightning.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And what would the logo be? It would be a lightning bolt, I guess, which is already used for Thunderbolt.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Yeah. So it's the I guess that circle means stick your pencil here.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Yeah, I guess. I don't know. It's like for lack of a better icon, they just use the circle.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  So you can kind of tell without peering into the slot, but it's very subtle.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  It is so super lightweight. It is so loseable.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  But I don't like you said they painted themselves in a corner.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  And what do you do? You can see something's going to get paint all over it or you're going to sit there forever.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  Yeah. I mean, my argument would be if you're going to the trouble of going this far and upgrading this thing,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  you should bite the bullet and make the new one pencil to compatible,
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  even if it's also pencil one compatible, which I don't know what is involved there.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  And you sell these adapters for your institutions that are desperate to hold on to their pencil ones.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  But now this thing only uses the pencil one. So you got to keep making them.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  And like the pencil two came out four years ago and they're like, nope, we're still doing pencil one.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  And that's going to keep on going into the future.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  So they could have mitigated this in a bunch of ways and they just decided not to because it might have cost them an extra.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  I mean, either either maybe the space isn't there or it cost them an extra 15 bucks that they don't want to give away on every sale.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  And so here we are.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Things I've tried with this since I've gotten the kit I have tried because I thought, well, wait,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  what if I put the adapter on the pencil one and then plug the US a USBC cable into an iPad Pro?
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Can I then pair a pencil one with is the reason that the iPad Pro has never supported pencil one,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  because it doesn't have lightning. So thus couldn't pair. Is that the only thing?
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  But when you try it, you get accessory not supported. This accessory is not supported by this device.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  OK, well, I tried. I asked Apple in a follow up question because I'm thinking what happens if you lose your.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Adapter, which I think is definitely it's 100 percent certain to happen to some people.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  Right. What do you do while you're waiting to either find it or buy a new one with a pencil that needs a charge?
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  And you've got a pencil one. It has a male lightning port sticking out of it.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  And how do you charge it if you don't have an iPad with a lightning port?
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  So I ask, can you charge it by plugging it into an iPhone? And I was told the answer is yes, it will charge plugged into.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Now, you obviously can't draw or pair it with an iPhone, but it will at least give it a charge.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  So that to me is actually pretty interesting. I mean, I don't know how many people would think to try that.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  But in a pinch, I can see how.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  So anybody out there who's going to be in this situation, if you file that away in your head, that in a pinch,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  if you have an Apple pencil one that needs a charge and you don't have the adapter,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  then you could plug it into an iPhone and charge it that way or at least get it enough charge to use it for a bit.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Right. What else? I'm trying to think what else I tried. I guess that's it. Anything else on the pencil?
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  No, it's just you think it's a good opportunity for people to point and laugh.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  I mean, I mean, Apple does need to live it down. But I think as we've described,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  like I get why they're at this point and I get that they maybe felt like they just had to choose.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  Do we do this kind of embarrassing thing or do we reduce our margins on this iPad?
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  And they're like, well, we're not reducing our margins. So we'll be we'll just handle the embarrassment and we'll move on.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  But it's not a great experience. I mean, I've seriously if you're somebody who ends up with this,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  look at that Logitech crayon because it's just going to be a way better experience all around,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  unless you absolutely need the pressure sensitivity stuff and you know if you are.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  But for most people, I feel like the crayon is not only will it work better with this iPad, but it'll also work with all the other ones.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  Right. That's the other. Yeah. For institution, like education buyers who might have might be thinking,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  well, we'll buy some of these iPads, but we might also have some other ones. iPad Airs or Pros or Minis, right?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  Even the mini and don't invest in the Apple Pencil one. Buy a crayon instead.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  Right. Buy the crayons instead. And because then you'll be able to keep using them going forward.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. And it is our good friends, my good friends, at least at Linode.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  They've got a new product released this year. Databases. They've got MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, I guess MySQL.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  I always say it that way. I guess the people who know what the hell they're talking about say MySQL.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  But whatever, however you pronounce it, they've got it. What they are are fully managed database services for those databases.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  It's simple and reliable. It is managed and you can easily deploy high performance database clusters.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  They allow you to quickly deploy a new database and defer management tasks like configurations, managing high availability.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  They've got disaster recovery, backups, data replications. You get all of that stuff, including secure access and very flexible plans.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  They've got award winning technical support that is offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to every level of user.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  Thanksgiving's coming up. You need technical support for your hosted managed servers on Thanksgiving.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Guess what? You can get it from Linode. That's the commitment they have to service.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  They're there all day, every day with really just terrific technical support.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  And they really do. They've got plans. It's really unbelievable.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  They've got plans from that that go from hobbyists, five dollar, ten dollar a month plans for just having like a server,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  like a Minecraft server or something like that that you want to run for your kids or just a hobbyist website or something like that,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  all the way up to genuine enterprise level support and massive server buys for truly professional needs.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  And it just scales right up and you get the same great tech support no matter which level you're at.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  They have the best price to performance value for all compute instances, including GPUs and block storage.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  Kubernetes bear their bare metal release. All that stuff may make cloud computing fast, simple and affordable.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  This is where I host during Fireball. I've been there for years.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  I expect to be there for many years to come. It is really it's just a terrific company and a terrific product.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  I could not be happier as a paying customer for my stuff. I just love it.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Go to Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E, linode.com slash the talk show and create a free account.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  You can use your Google or GitHub accounts to do that or just sign up with email, which is what I would do, honestly.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  And by going to linode.com slash the talk show, you get a hundred bucks in credit, a hundred dollars.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  You're getting paid just to sign up and being a listener of this show.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  So my thanks to Linode for hosting during Fireball and for sponsoring the show.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  All right. The big change that that is the most notable change,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  I think, bigger than going from lightning to USB-C, honestly, because USB-C is sort of like the iPad catching up to the rest of the iPad lineup.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  The one that now puts the just plain no adjective, low priced iPad ahead of all other iPads is that front facing camera moving to the long side or as Apple calls it, the landscape side.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Sure. And it's everybody's been clamoring for it. I've wanted it. I actually because my kitchen laptop is my iPad.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And so like when Amy and I like we FaceTime family or anybody else like our school stuff now that the kids in college, we don't really parents aren't really involved, thankfully.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  But I like when Jonas was in high school and there'd be stuff and during COVID for sure with school stuff, we did the Zoom stuff together with an iPad.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  And it's just a constant irritation to me that in a laptop configuration, the camera is wrong.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  It makes it look it's too it's even lower than at the top.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  And everybody knows that desk height laptop front facing camera is unflattering looking up at your face and your nose.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  But putting it even lower makes it even worse. And putting it on the side when you're looking at the people on screen,
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  the camera on the side makes it look like you're looking off screen, like you're not paying attention to the call.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And if you stare at the camera so that you look like you're paying attention, you can't see the people's faces.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  It is it is the wrong orientation if you're using it in a laptop configuration.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  And the first iPad to move it is the just plain iPad.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  And I have to say, as soon as I fired it up and used it, I was like, oh, my God, this is weird.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  I look right in FaceTime on an iPad. Yeah, no, it's huge.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  I did the same thing. I was like, oh, now it's right.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Now it's but it also felt weird because I'm so used to looking wrong on the iPad.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  And at the exact event, but on the exact same announcement,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  they released brand new iPad pros that don't move the camera at all.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Yeah, because as we said, I think this is I take this as a sign that Apple has realized that that's the right orientation,
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  that that people are FaceTiming and people are using their iPads in the landscape orientation,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  which I've always been a landscape primary iPad user.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  So it's always been funny to me that, you know, originally when it booted up, the Apple was sideways.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  They fixed that. They changed that. The logo on the back is still that direction.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  But they could fix that at a future time and that the camera was on essentially the side.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  And so this is a sign, I think I choose to take it as a sign that Apple has realized that that iPads are more often used horizontally than vertically.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  And that's where the camera should go. That's a great sign.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  But they haven't put it out in any of their other products. That is back to our previous conversation about why is the iPad Pro the way it is.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  I think the answer is they, for whatever reason, decided they weren't going to change the hardware,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  the external hardware design of the iPad Pro this year, probably because they have another design in the works
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  and they weren't ready to bring it out now and they did not.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  They were not interested in doing some sort of interim thing,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  because if you change where the camera is, that is a major relaying out of the internals of that device
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  and they decided they weren't going to do it. So here we are.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  And I think that in years past, they might have just not upgraded the iPads Pro this year
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  and just let them go two years between updates, right?
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  A lot of Apple products have not, over the years, been updated on a consistent schedule
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  and some products have gone an almost bizarre number of years between updates.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  To me, the biggest and best example there probably ever will be, or hopefully ever will be, would be the non-Retina MacBook Airs.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  The rest of the MacBook lineup had moved to Retina displays and the MacBook Air didn't
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  and they were just stuck on what was clearly an old design with a now crappy looking screen.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  You know, and maybe there were speed bumps in there from Intel, but nothing that you...
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  And now I feel like with Apple Silicon, and now that the iPad Pros are on the M series and they're numbering them,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  I think they want to keep, every year there's going to be an M number plus one
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  and I think they want to put the M number plus one in the iPad Pro every year.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  And I think they're going to try to put these iPads on an annual update schedule like the iPhone.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  Yeah, maybe. I mean, it's been 18 months since the M1 Air, so it could be that 18 months is what they would end up wanting to do.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  And I think it's unclear to me still about the A series and the M series,
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  whether they're going to stay in perfect sync or if they might skip an A series.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Every so often with the M, so that the M3 is not based on the A17 or whatever it is, but is on the 18.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  They could do something like that at some point.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  But regardless, yeah, I take your point, which is they're making these chips.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Like you make an M2, why would you not update your iPad Pro to be an M2 iPad Pro?
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Even if you're not changing the hardware in many other cases, why would you not take the opportunity to just refresh?
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Because it's your chip and why not put it the more of them you make, the more of them you sell, the cheaper it is to make it.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  So why would you not push ahead? Right.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  And you get like a 15 to 20 percent increase in performance, depending how you matter.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  And it doesn't really matter if it's closer to 15 for your needs or 20.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  If that's for a year over year speed bump chip upgrade, 15 to 20 percent is terrific.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  And if they can keep that going for a decade or more to come, that's that sort of compound interest that really can,
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  in the same way that 15 to 20 percent growth in an investment can really create wealth over time.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  15 to 20 percent performance improvements aren't that big for one year, but compounded add up tremendously.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And if they want to keep moving them out every year, I think we're going to see years like this
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  where really the only news is, oh, it went from the MX to the MX plus one.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I would guess, for example, that come next summer or maybe sooner, maybe like in May or something like that or April,
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  there will be a new MacBook Air with the M3 and it's going to look exactly like this year's brand new MacBook Airs,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  maybe just different colors to refresh per year.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  But otherwise, exactly the same and just goes to the M3.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  If we assume that the M3 is based on the A16, yes.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  The only question there in my mind is, given what's going on at TSMC, do they hold out for next fall's A series?
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Are they kind of like, we're going to jump over that one and make the next one the basis of the M3?
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  That's the only question.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  But otherwise, yes, I think you're right.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  There's going to be an M3 MacBook Air at some point and it will be as soon as the M3 is available,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  they'll just start rolling it out.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Again, it's not like Intel.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  They control the rollout and why would you not want that chip everywhere?
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  Especially since most people aren't upgrading from the previous model.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  They're upgrading from two or three models past, so that compound interest.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Again, if you've got a 2018 iPad Pro, you probably don't need to update to the M2 version,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  but if you do, you're going from an A12X to an M2.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  That is a substantial, in my tests, for single processors especially, but the A12Z and the A12X,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  the A14 iPad is basically as fast as they are, if not a little bit faster at some things.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  So you could get a big update that way, but you're probably not coming from the M1 to the M2
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  unless you're an artist who really wants the new hover feature for Apple Pencil.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  Unless you're editing high-end video or something, that speed boost is not going to really matter to you.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  Yeah, the hover feature is really interesting to me.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  I really wonder if they've artificially gated this.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  They claim that it requires the M2.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Maybe there's something involved with the M2, this proximity detection,
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  but I'm a little suspicious that it was gated just so they could have a feature to say this feature is new on the new iPad Pros.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  It might have required a radio update or a little bit of an update to the digitizer or something like that.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  It's possible that to get the extra precision, they had to update a part.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  That might not even be a very expensive part, who knows, but it was enough that they said,
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  let's do this. It's like the Apple TV 4K where they were saying that HDR10 Plus was going to be a feature of tvOS,
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  and then they said, no, no, no, it's just on the new hardware.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  It might just be that they looked at it on the old hardware and it wasn't quite great,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  and they're like, let's pull it because the new hardware can do it and this one, it's a little iffy.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  It might be that simple that they looked at this and were like, this feature is not good enough on the current hardware,
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  so when we do the next iPad Pro, let's do a little bit more so that we can roll this feature out.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  That's my guess.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  But other than the hover, the only real difference from the previous generation of iPad Pros to this generation,
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  the only difference is the M1 to M2 transition and the performance increase it does.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  It's that and hover, and I think that's it.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  Or is there Wi-Fi 6E?
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  Wi-Fi 6E.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  Which again is like, it's a pretty esoteric list of items.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  It's a speed bump, what we always called the speed bump.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  It is faster and slightly better, but otherwise it's a very familiar product.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  It's not like going to the 10th generation iPad.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  It's not like going from the M1 Air to the M2 Air.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  It's not that kind of a thing.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  No, and the hover thing though is really neat.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  I don't know what, we probably saw the same demos from Apple.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  Yeah, like Procreate was the big one that I saw,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  and I was sitting with somebody who's a Procreate professional basically,
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  was the other person at my briefing, and she was levitating during that part.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  And I know for a lot of people it's going to be a nothing feature,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  because what it really is doing is showing you a preview
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  of what you're going to do when you put your pencil down.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  So when you're hovering over it, and it's using a lot of the stuff
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  that is involved in the iOS or iPad OS pointer,
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  so like it'll make icons bigger when you hover over them
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  before you tap on them, and there's some stuff.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  There's an API to do more.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  For me, the moment where I thought, okay, that is interesting,
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  and not just kind of a nice like a preview for artists to like,
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  oh, that's not what my setting should be, and I'm going to fix it,
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  is the idea that you're adding another state, right?
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  Like there used to be two pencil states, which was
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  the pencil's not down, and the pencil is down.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  And now there's three pencil states.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  There's the pencil's nowhere, the pencil's down,
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  and the pencil is hovering close, but not there.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  And as a developer, you can use that to either infer things,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  the state changes, infer things about them.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  So Apple's doing that with Scribble, where Apple can,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  they can infer that you're done writing faster
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  because you leave the focus state,
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  and they know that the pencil has left.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  And so it can like process it faster because it's able to tell
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  is the pencil still hovering or is it gone,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  which it couldn't do before.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  So that's interesting.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  But the Procreate stuff is where it really blew me away
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  because that's where they're saying,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  oh, well, when you're hovering and you double tap,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  it does something different.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  Or if you're hovering and you move your finger on the screen,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  you slide or you pinch, it does a completely different thing
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  than if you were to slide or pinch with the pencil not present.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  It does a, you know, you're changing the opacity
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  or you're changing the size of the brush.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Right.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  And that was that moment where I thought, okay,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  that, for people who use the Apple Pencil,
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  especially in artistic areas,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  the ability to add a second level of gestures
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  based on a hover state versus a pen down state
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  is a place where like the Procreate demo was the perfect one.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Like that's really good because you can preview,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  see what you're doing, not like it,
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  use your double tap or use your fingers on the iPad
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  to change what is going to be put down
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  when you put the pencil down and then put the pencil down.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  I know it's a little esoteric and it's only going to work
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  for very specific kind of pencil oriented workflows on the iPad,
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  but that was my moment where I said, okay,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  this isn't just kind of a novelty and a preview
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  because all of a sudden you can have a whole second set of gestures
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  based on where the pencil is.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  That's cool.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Yeah.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  The one that really got me and I could really see,
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  I'm not a serious artist at all, even an unserious artist,
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  but I love watching good artists, talented artists work digitally.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  I love watching anybody who's good at their job work,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  but anybody who's ever done that,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  or if you're out there listening
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  and you are like a serious Photoshop jockey or something like that,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  everybody I know who's like that works with two hands
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  where they've got their dominant hand on the drawing thing,
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  but a stylus or their trackpad or the mouse or whatever,
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  and their other hand on the keyboard, like in Photoshop,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  and Photoshop has long had these like single character keystrokes
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  where you just hit, I don't know,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  I actually don't have them memorized,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  but you hit like E to get the eraser.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  So you don't have to go click a palette tool over there.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  You just have the mouse right here and you hit a button
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  and it instantly changes from the paintbrush to the eraser
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  and you erase and then you just hit another button.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  You watch somebody and they have these things memorized
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  the way that like a touch typist knows how to type
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  or a pianist knows how to play the piano
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  without thinking about where these things are
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  and that pinching with your off hand to change the brush size
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  as you hover close to the iPad surface
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  to go from a fine point to a broader point
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  and without having to look off to the side
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  to where there's a dial to adjust the brush size,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  that seems like something that's not a minor update
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  but a major one because it keeps you in the flow
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  and you're just flying through your work like that.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  I think it's really cool.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  It also plays off all of the stuff that they did
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  for the trackpad support in iOS.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  So like when you're on a web page now,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  you finally for the first time in iOS without the trackpad,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  you can get hover effects.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  So if you hover the pencil over a link on a web page,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  the link lights up before you tap it.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  And that's all lifted from the pointer support.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  And same thing with like all the little buttons,
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  the way buttons get like a hover effect with the mouse pointer,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  they get it with a pencil now too
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  throughout the whole user interface.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  And hovering has been a lost, for lack of a better word,
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  dimension in user interface on touch screens
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  ever since the iPhone came out, right?
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  And as much as touch screens have proven to be
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  the most popular way of doing personal computing
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  ever since the iPhone came out,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  losing hover has been a loss, right?
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  It's many steps forward, but one step back
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  with the loss of hover, which is a useful dimension
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  in user interface.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Just one example would be
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  somebody who makes poor choices in their color and decoration
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  for their web page to highlight a link.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  If you have black text on a white background
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  and your links are navy blue,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  but aren't even underlined,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  visually it's hard to see.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  And somebody who maybe doesn't pick up color that well
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  may not see it.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  So you could always on a Mac or a Windows machine
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  just hover the mouse over something if you think it's a link
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  and it will hopefully have a hover effect that lights up
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  and you're like, oh, yes.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  So without clicking it or right-clicking it or anything,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  you can just tell, okay, that's a link.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Well, you get that with a pencil now.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  Now, is that a reason to buy a new iPad Pro
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  just to have, I mean, how many people
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  are surfing with their pencil as opposed to their finger?
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  No, but it's a nice use.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And it shows that they are trying to align
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  work that they've done before, right?
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  It's like, well, we already did this work for a hover state
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  for the Magic Keyboard and for any external pointing devices.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Why would we not use that for this state too?
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  And that's nice.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  Yeah, I write my Mac roll column every week.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  I need to put in IDG system and they have,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  like to create a new entry is a menu with a hover state.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  And I often write those on the iPad.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  And then when I started doing this,
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  it was like you had to tap and it didn't open the menu.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  It just took you to a second screen
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  and then you load that screen and then you could press new.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  And I still am delighted by the fact
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  that I can now move my pointer over that menu.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  It drops down the dropdown menu
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  and I can click new directly from there.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  And that's because there's a hover state on iPad OS now,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  and it's a good thing.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  But otherwise it's pretty pedestrian.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  And I will say here,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  so I got a really interesting email
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  from a Daring Fireball reader after Monday's
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  or Tuesday's announcement.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  And this is a fellow who works at a very large corporation.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  Probably, I think he might've even said Fortune 500
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  and they have to my ears, draconian IT requirements.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  And the nature of his job is he travels a lot
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  and he flies all the time.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  And his colleagues are in the same boat there.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  I don't know what they do.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  It doesn't matter, but he's always traveling.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  And his go-to machine for years now
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  has been an iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  because primarily, his primary reason
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  is that the IT department mandates
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  that if you're using a Mac or Windows laptop,
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  you can only use the apps, their enterprise apps
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  within the company when you're connected to the VPN
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  for security reasons.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  But with iPads, they let you use the apps
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  installed locally on the device.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  That sounds draconian to me that they don't let you use it.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  But like he said, therefore it's the choice.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  With the iPad, for all the reasons
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  he might prefer using a MacBook to an iPad for productivity,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  the fact that he can just use his software
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  when he's on a plane and couldn't with the VPN
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  or can't reliably.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  And he said, a bunch of my colleagues
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  are in the same boat.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  So him and his colleagues are largely
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  iPad Pro users for this reason.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  And that makes all the sense in the world to me,
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  given those restrictions.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  And he said the single biggest complaint
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  that he and all of his colleagues
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  have had all along is the placement of the camera
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  because they're also, the nature of their work
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  as corporate employees who travel a lot,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  they're on Zoom or whatever else,
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Webex, whatever their company uses,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  all the time for meetings.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  And they've got a camera that is wrongly placed.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  So if he were buying a new iPad right now,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  he'd insta-buy the regular iPad,
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  downgrading from an iPad Pros just for the camera.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  And because he knows that the A14 is good enough,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  none of the apps he uses need an M1.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  That type of app, he knows it would run just fine.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  The camera alone would make him upgrade.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  I thought that was very interesting.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  I'm sure he's not alone.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  I was flying a little bit recently.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  I've noticed, I do see more and more people
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  with iPads in airports.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  It is slowly a growing trend, in my opinion.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I see them on a plane.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  I mean, that's like my favorite thing to do
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  as I wander up and down the aisle
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  to go pee as I inevitably do every flight.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  I like to see what devices are people using
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  and what are they doing on them?
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  Are they watching movies?
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Are they doing spreadsheets?
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  What are people doing?
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  Definitely more iPads.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  I have bad news for this fellow, though,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  or anybody else who was thinking similarly
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  that I'll just buy an iPad
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  because I want the camera in the right place.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  If you're a frequent traveler is, to me,
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  one of the biggest downsides
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  of this new magic keyboard folio
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  is because it uses a kickstand to support the screen,
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  it has an enormous footprint on the desk,
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  and there's no way that it would fit
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  on an airplane tray.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  No, or in your lap, really.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  Right, it needs a tabletop, right?
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  And it's a $250 product.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  It is the 11-inch magic keyboard
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  for the 11-inch Pro and the iPad Air is $299,
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  so it's $50 different.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  So it's in the ballpark.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  I find this keyboard for the regular iPad
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  to be a very curious design.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  Especially for that reason,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  the footprint, to me, is significant.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  I was just on the train
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  because I went to New York for the briefing,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  and on the train, I like to get the seats
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  that have on the Acela,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  or even the non-Acelas have them.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  There's fewer of them, though,
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  but you can sit at a table and you face.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  There's four people, two on each side of the table,
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  and you're half of the table
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  if you draw the invisible border
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  that's between your side and the person facing you
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  is certainly deeper than an airplane tray,
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  but I don't think that this would fit.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  I think you could fit it on the table,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  but you'd have to extend the kickstand
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  past your I'm going to be polite to my fellow traveler
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  and not cross the 50-yard line.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  Yeah, there's a lot of depth there.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  You need a lot of space.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  Again, I kind of get why they did it,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  which is I think they decided, honestly,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  I think they decided that they don't want to make
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  a new keyboard without a trackpad.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  They've got the ones that they've put out before
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  that are still out there that are those smart keyboards
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  that are only keyboards and no trackpads,
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  but I feel like they've decided,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  no, we're going to move,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  really want everything to be kind of like this,
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  but the problem is that in this case,
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  it's attaching to the smart connector on the side,
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  not the back, and then how do you keep it upright?
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  And short of building a cantilevered magic keyboard style
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  for this, which would require them to move
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  where the smart connector is and all of that,
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  they fell back on something that actually third-party iPad cases
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  have been doing for a long time,
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  which is this kickstand approach.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  And of course, Microsoft does this.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  They put a kickstand in their surfaces and things like that,
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  and I feel like the message is very much like,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  we know it's not as good, but this is the low-end iPad,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  so what do you want?
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  I will point out that it's 249.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  It is not cheap.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  This keyboard case is 249.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  It is in two pieces.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  They don't attach to each other.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  There's a magnetic attach on the back
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  that's much thicker than you think it's going to be
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  because it's got the kickstand built into it,
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  and then there's the part that magnetic attaches on the side
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  to the smart connector,
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  and that's got the trackpad and the keyboard.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  So I would not choose to use this,
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  mostly because I do use my iPad in my lap all the time
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  when I'm in keyboard mode, and this doesn't work that way.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  That said, I'm really happy that it's got function keys at the top
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  because that's the thing that's missing
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  from the existing iPad Magic Keyboard,
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  and I assume you can't never say never,
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  but I assume this is Apple admitting
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  that it's better with them than without them.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  I wonder on that point because all along,
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  ever since the first Magic Keyboard,
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  and again, for anybody who's confused, I keep messing it up.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  Magic Keyboard is the cantilevered 300,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  and it's 350 for the 12.9-inch.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  It's the one for the iPad Pros and the iPad Air,
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  and it's a one-piece thing that has a stiff cantilevered hinge.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  The new thing for the iPad is the smart key...
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  No, it's the smart...
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Yes, no. Jesus.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  It's the Magic Keyboard Folio.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  Magic means trackpad.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  So the one that doesn't...
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  The one that doesn't have a trackpad
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  is just called the Smart Keyboard Folio,
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  and that's only for the same models
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  that take the Magic Keyboard.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  To me, I don't know who's buying that product.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  I can only imagine it's only being bought
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  by someone who's never really tried the trackpad
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  with their iPad because if you've tried it,
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  I can't imagine why you would want it without the trackpad.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  I mean, I really can't because the trackpad support
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  is so game-changing when you're using an iPad
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  in one of these products.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  Before they came out with trackpad support,
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  every time we'd talk about iPads on any podcast,
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  everybody would say,
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  boy, I sure wish you could have a trackpad
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  when you're using it as a laptop.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  And now that you can, it is great.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  They came up with it, truly knocked it out of the park
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  with the implementation in a way that fits with the iPad OS
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  without taking anything away from touch
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  and not just mimicking the Mac
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  and having an arrow pointer and stuff like that.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  It's all great.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  I don't know why anybody would want it,
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  but apparently they do because they're still selling it.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  And even that's not cheap.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  That's 180 bucks for the 11-inch
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  and $200 for the 12.9-inch.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  It's mind-boggling to me that someone would spend $200
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  and get one without a trackpad, but there it is.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  I thought ever since the Magic Keyboard came out,
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  the one for the iPad Pros,
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  that the reason they didn't have function keys
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  wasn't so much they didn't think iPad needed them,
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  but because those keys would be underneath the iPad
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  in the design.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  But I sort of feel like people,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  especially just to have an escape key,
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and again, this is one of those nerd things
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  where the nerdier people who are more likely to have an iPad Pro
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  are the ones who really want an escape key.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  I think over the last few years,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  there's been more discussion of escape keys
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  in our commentariat crowd
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  than some people at Apple could ever believe.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  Whoever the pro,
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  ah, we don't need escape keys on iPads.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  People are.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  I think that they've been surprised by how much,
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  yes, some people really do need the escape key on the keyboard.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  So I think it's weird that the people
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  who are more likely to need an escape key
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  are more likely to own the iPad Pros
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  that come with $300 keyboards that don't have it.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  And if they had to reach under the iPad to get to it,
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  it would still be better than not having it.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  Yeah, what it really does is put the lie to the argument
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  that you don't need them
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  because they're all in control center, right?
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Which is a dumb argument,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  but I definitely heard people say,
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  well, you can just use those in control center, it's fine.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  I don't know if people from Apple told that to me
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  or it was just people on the internet,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  but that was like, oh, well, you don't really need it.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  But here it is, right?
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Like, here it is.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  They obviously, Apple has endorsed the idea
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  and they have managed to fill up every single F key
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  with a function, right?
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  But it's so much better to change your brightness
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  from the keyboard when you're working on a keyboard
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  or change the volume.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  It's so much better.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  And so to see Apple put it on one of these magic keyboards,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  even if it's not the one that I use,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  I feel like is Apple saying, okay, we get it.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  There is actually value in having that escape key
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  and all of those hardware control keys.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  And I would be surprised
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  if we didn't see this layout going forward, right?
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  It's unfortunate it's not there today,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  but I would be surprised if this is in the future,
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  like the center on the horizontal side camera.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  These feel like iPad product line decisions
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  that have just come here first.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  We often talk about the ways,
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  the subtle ways that the Mac,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  subtle and sometimes not subtle ways
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  that the Mac interface has been sort of iOS-ified
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  in recent years,
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  but it works both ways
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  where there are habits from using a MacBook
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  that you wanna carry forward.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  If you just want it all to be a seamless,
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  you're in the Apple ecosystem
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  and obviously Apple would like it
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  if you're the sort of person who owns both an iPad
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  and a MacBook and to have those habits.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Part of the habit of using a MacBook
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  is that you just reach up to that function key row.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  And I think it's also part of the reason
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  that the Touch Bar had so many people
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  who actually outright despised it
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  is that it just broke a habit in that way
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  and replaced it with solutions
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  that weren't as good for adjusting brightness.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  As clever as it was
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  that you could just touch it and slide it,
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  people didn't know that you could do it.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  It wasn't obvious that you could just touch it yet.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  People thought you had to tap it and then tap again.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  And you can't feel those buttons and click them.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  And people just wanna whack,
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  just tap a button to silence it.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  All of a sudden a video starts playing sound.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Just reach up with your finger
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  and tap the button to silence it instantly.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  People want to do that.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  And not being able to do it with your iPad Pros
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  continues to be frustrating.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  So the question is,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  why not have new keyboard for the iPad Pro?
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  And I think the answer is
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  that they've got a lot of these keyboards out there already.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  And I again suspect that there is a new keyboard
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  coming for a new set of iPad Pro models
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  and that's for later.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  And so you just have to use,
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  because let's be honest,
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  they would sell a bunch of these 300 and up keyboards
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  if they added the function row.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  A bunch of people would buy it just to get the function row,
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  but they're not prepared to do that
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  because that's obviously a 2023 or beyond sort of thing.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  That's just the decision they made,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  not to turn over those.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  I mean, on one level it's good, right?
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  Because like, don't make me buy another one of those.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  But on another level, it's sad
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  because I would love a function row on my keyboard.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  I would too.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  And I also think most people would under,
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  it'd be better to have one
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  that you have to reach under the iPad to get to
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  than not have it at all.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  So hopefully Apple has taken that to heart.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  I know that these briefings that we get are off the record
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  and I agree, I always agree.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  And I'm gonna risk Apple PR's ire
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  by subtly breaking this and quoting somebody from Apple.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  But one of the people I was in the briefing with
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  asked whether the new iPad,
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  regular iPad's magic keyboard folio comes in other colors
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  and the person from Apple said, yes.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  You can get it in any color you want as long as it's white.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Which I thought was, and we all laughed,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  but it is, it's only,
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  so if you thought that the pro magic keyboard's
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  only being available in a white and black
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  or space gray or whatever they call it, graphite,
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  whatever it's called, it's limiting.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  This one's only white.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  It carries forward one of the least favorite
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  and to me baffling and least Apple-like decisions
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  Apple has ever made in my lifetime,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  which is the fact that the right,
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  the left bracket key is a full size key
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  and the right bracket key is a half size key.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  So that's the key, that's a square bracket
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  or with shift a curly bracket,
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  curly brace or whatever you wanna call it.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Left one full size, right one half size.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  That's the same as with the 11 inch magic keyboard
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  for the pros or the air.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  I find this decision to be so baffling
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  and on Apple-like that clearly these two keys
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  are siblings that should be given equal weight
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  because anytime you use one,
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  you eventually need to use the other.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  And so, and I get to that on this form factor,
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  numerous keys need to be smaller than they would be
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  because it is a compressed,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  because of the aspect ratio of the screen,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  it's actually a smaller, significantly smaller keyboard
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  than even a 13 inch MacBook Air.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  And they're committed to keeping the letter,
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  the letters and numbers to be full sized,
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  which means everything else has to shrink.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  So why in the world they wouldn't just make
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  both of those keys three quarter size, right?
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  And there are three quarter size keys on this,
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  like the option key instead of being,
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  it's not half size, it's not full size,
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  it's three quarter size.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  The tab key is slightly different than the option key.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Well, and there's the backslash bar key there too.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  They could take all three of those and make them
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  essentially fit in the two space as all the same size
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  and they didn't do that.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  But at the very least,
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  the two brace keys should be the same width,
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  whether they each be two thirds or each be three quarters,
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  or even if they were both half,
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  even if they were both the smallest size,
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  but they should be the same size.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  The asymmetry of those two keys for a company
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  that is obsessed with symmetry,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  that I just can't believe it.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  I honestly find that to be the most surprising,
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  one of the most surprising design decisions
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  they've ever made.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  And I can't believe they didn't take a chance
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  to correct it here, but they didn't.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  Yeah, maybe next time.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  All right, I've got one more sponsor to thank
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  and then we'll hit the home stretch.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  Third base heading home.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  And I want to thank our good friends at Indochino.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  Indochino, finding the perfect suit
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  for everyone is impossible,
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  but finding a suit that's perfect for you is simple,
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  thanks to Indochino.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  You just choose your favorite fabric
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  and customize every detail to find the look
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  that's perfect for you.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  Now, if you want to, you can submit your measurements
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  if you know them online.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Order a whole suit online at Indochino's website,

[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  which is great if it's nearby you
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  or you don't know your measurements
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  or perhaps your measurements have changed.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Get a custom made-for-you fit at an incredible price.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  They've got a new fall collection featuring new colors

[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  the lapels, the linings, monograms, and more.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  Get one that is exactly the way you want it,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  and you can get a premium personalized wardrobe.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  They've got more than suits.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  They've got custom fitted shirts.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  They've got casual wear, outerwear, and more.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  They're always adding new designs, fabric options,
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  including all the stuff in their latest fall collection.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Indochino lets you make any suit a tux,
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  if that's what you need.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  You want to own a tuxedo?
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  You can do it.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  I've been there.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  I have got a couple of their shirts.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  They are terrific.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  They look great.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Everybody, my wife says they're very stylish.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  They say they're very flattering to me.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  They fit great.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  I love them.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  They're very comfortable.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Really, it's a great place.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  I like shopping there in person.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  It's really great if you have one nearby.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  I recommend you check them out in person if you can,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  but their online shopping is as good as any other place I've seen, too.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  So, what do you do?

[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  Your prize is in the mail.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  Okay, great.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  Is it a suit?
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  It's a pencil one.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  Oh, no.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Tucked into the lapel of a suit.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  With a dead battery.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  Anything else on the iPads,
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  we could homestretch it and just talk about iPadOS,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  but if you have any other things about the hardware.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  I don't think so.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  I think the overview is that, taken on their own,
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  they all are kind of reasonable,
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  and then you look at the big picture and you're like,
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  why did that happen?
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  But that's other than the pencil adapter,
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  which is just a weird thing that happened.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  I guess this will be my wrap-up.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  I think the 10th generation iPad is great.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  I think that A14 processor, you can do anything.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  Unless you're a high-end video person or something,
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  you can do anything with that thing.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  If you're looking for a compact writing device
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  or something like that,
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  you don't really need an iPad Pro for that,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  or even an iPad Air.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  You could be out there with this thing that's fairly small.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  You get the keyboard thing, and I don't love the kickstand,
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  but $700, that's your low-cost Apple laptop that's an iPad.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  And it includes the trackpad.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  It's a really nice device.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  The only thing I would say that makes me sad about it
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  is that keyboard does require the kickstand,
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  which means if you want something lappable,
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  you do have to spend a couple hundred dollars more
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  to get that iPad Air with the keyboard.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  Yeah, I really do wish that it somehow
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  they'd been able to make it work with the Magic Keyboard
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  and let you choose which one you wanted
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  if you'd rather have this or not.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  And one of the reasons they made it two pieces,
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  it clearly didn't have to be two pieces,
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  but they did it on purpose
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  so that you can just use the back as a kickstand
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  if you don't need the keyboard.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000]  So there's definitely use,
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  and there it'll fit better on an airplane tray table
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000]  than a Magic Keyboard would, right?
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  If you just leave the keyboard in your bag
[01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  and just put the back on,
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  and you've got a terrific kickstand
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  just for watching a movie or something like that.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  And it folds all the way around.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  You can put the keyboard on the other way backwards
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  and it'll reject the keys,
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  but then you can fold the keyboard over
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  and just use it to draw and stuff like that.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  There's flexibility there,
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  but I do wish it worked with both
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  because if you really want a laptop
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  that you can use on your actual lap
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  or like my son does everywhere he goes,
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  it's just walk around with it open
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  as he continues to watch movies with his AirPods in.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  You can't do that with this.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  Oh, the other thing,
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  I guess we didn't talk about the colors.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  I think the colors are terrific.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  They look great.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  They did a good job.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  Yeah, they sent me yellow,
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  but I saw all of them in person in New York,
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  and I thought they were all terrific.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  I thought it was a great blue, great pink.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  I love the yellow.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  Yellow, I think, is the...
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  And I would not have expected it.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  If you just told me yellow would be my favorite,
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  I would have thought, that's weird,
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  but I really like it.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  Yeah, it's super yellowy gold, basically.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  It's really nice there.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  The blue is gorgeous,
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  and the pink, which seemed pretty red to me,
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  but it's like they're eye-popping colors.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  They're really good.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  Apple has this tendency to come out with colors
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  on their products sometimes that are a little too subtle.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  Even the iPad Air is like that,
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  and these are not subtle, and I love it.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  I wish that Apple would have a broader color palette
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  for all of its products,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  where it accepts that some people want them to be subtle
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  and some people don't,
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  and instead they seem to have just decided
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  higher-end products can't be colored anything but subtly,
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  and low-end products can be bright and exciting,
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  which I think is too bad.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  But yeah, they look great.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  You will not be sad if you buy a blue iPad 10th generation.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  It's going to stand out and be a nice little iPad.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  So iPadOS is shipping...
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  Well, it'll be out by the time this podcast is out.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  So along with iOS 16.1,
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  but that's nowhere near as big a deal.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  I mean, this is the first iPads are getting
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  to the iOS 16 train.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  I've been using it for months on my iPad,
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  and they've relented.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  I don't know if I've mentioned this on any recent episode.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  I know everybody listening probably does know
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  that Stage Manager is no longer limited
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  only to the M1 iPads.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  It's like all iPad pros from 2018 onward.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  Let's just say I've got popcorn in the house ready to pop
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  for when this hits everybody who's been reluctant
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  to try the betas, you know,
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  and people get their first taste of Stage Manager on iPadOS,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  and not because I think it's a disaster.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  I actually...
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  To me, it's what's interesting is
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  I think there are clearly problems with it.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  I don't think it's been...
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  I don't think it's really ready.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  Hopefully, they keep cooking how it works,
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  but it's not like this terrible...
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  Like if they had shipped the redesigned Safari tabs
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  from last year,
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  the ones that I spent thousands of words disparaging,
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  and then they relented and said,
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  you know what? Never mind. We're not going to do it.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  I think that was an unmitigated disaster,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  which is why I wrote about it as...
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  Fearsomely? I don't know what word to describe it as I did,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  because I really thought it was a disaster if they shipped it.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  I did not do that with Stage Manager for iPad
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  because I have very mixed feelings about it,
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  and I think the fact that there was so much demand for it
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  from users whose iPad pros weren't yet M1s
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  shows that people want to try it or like the idea of it,
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  and I think some people might be very happy.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  I think it's going to be very bifurcating when it comes out.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  I think there's going to be some people who get it,
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  and they're like, I love it. This is great.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  I can't believe all of you people who've been complaining about it
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  for months about the betas.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  You're just a bunch of grumpy grippers looking to complain.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  This is terrific,
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  and then I think there's going to be other people who are like,
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  I can't believe Apple shipped this.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  Yeah, I agree. It's definitely going to be split.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  The nice thing is it's a mode,
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  so if you don't like it, you can just turn it off and not use it,
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  and the old split-screen multitasking thing is still there.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  They didn't take it away, which they could have done, right?
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  They could have been like, everything's got Windows now.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  Good luck, everybody, and they didn't do that,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  but it feels like a work in progress.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  I think that you got that exactly right.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  There's more that needs to be done,
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  and it feels like they just ran out of time,
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  and they're shipping it, and I think the key,
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  and I was thinking about this as I wrote my Mac OS review, too,
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  but I think it's true about iOS as well, or iPad OS,
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  is Apple in the past has had this tendency to ship features
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  and then forget them, right?
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Like, here it is, and then even the original iPad multitasking,
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  everybody's like, but what about this and this?
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  Very obvious things that you need to fix,
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  and silence for two years, and then they fix them.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  And there's a bunch of stuff in Mac OS and iPad OS,
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  and Stage Manager is one of them,
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  where it's, you guys are on the path to something here,
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  but you're not there yet, and if you abandon this now
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  and say, see you in a year or two,
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  you are doing every user a huge disservice.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  More, I feel like a teacher.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  That's sort of where I ended up with my Mac OS review, too,
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  is like, see me after class.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  It's like, this is an incomplete.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  You need to keep working on it.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  You're not done with your job.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  So I hope that Apple is looking at Stage Manager
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  and the system settings in Mac OS
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  and a bunch of these kind of features and being like,
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  okay, we have to ship this,
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  but we are going to keep iterating on it
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  throughout the year.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  You're not going to have to wait until the next version of the OS.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  We're going to keep on plugging here,
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  because we know that we have more work to do.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  And if that's what they do with Stage Manager,
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  I think Stage Manager has a future.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  If they let it sit there for a year or two,
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  everybody's just going to turn it off and forget that it existed,
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  or at least a lot of people are.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  And there is a way forward here.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  Like, I saw a tweet today that I put the link in for you.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000]  Maybe you can put it in the show notes.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  It's from Steve Trotton Smith, the developer.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  And he has a lot of experience with Windows systems as well.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  So he knows how the tiling works on Windows,
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  and he says the iPad doesn't really match up.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  And I don't love tiling, but it's true.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  It's way easier and more intuitive to do that sort of thing on Windows.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  But he made a bulleted list that I think is really good,
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  which is, here's what you could do.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  Make stage creation manual so it isn't creating stages all the time.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  Let you move the windows around per pixel,
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  even if it's not the default, so they don't all auto-rearrange,
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  which is one of my great frustrations,
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  is you gave us arbitrary windows and then said they can't be arbitrary.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  Why make that decision?
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  It's like one or the other, but to be in the middle is so strange.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  Steve says, new windows should always be created by default
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  in the current stage, not spawning a new stage.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  Never kick back to the springboard.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  Let the stage be empty if it needs to be.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  And he says, remove the four-window limit, which, sure,
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  and then put together an API package supporting Stage Manager.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  But his list there, I mean, it really goes to the heart
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  of what I find frustrating about Stage Manager,
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  is I can't get the windows where I want to be.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  When I click on links, they open, or tap on app icons,
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  they open in weird places that take me away from my work,
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  and then I have to spend time dragging everything back around.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  Like, all the pieces are there,
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  but there's just a bunch of detail work that needs to be done.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  And I really hope that Apple is going to spend the next six months
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  doing the detail work, because that's my overall feeling
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  about Stage Manager, is I don't think it's fundamentally a bad idea.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  I just think it's not done, and if Apple thinks it's done,
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  we have a problem.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  If Apple thinks that they can go a year without fixing it,
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  we have a problem.
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  But if Apple is going to keep working on it,
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000]  all right, then that's fine.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  Let's do that.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  It's a very ambitious feature,
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  and I really am understanding of that.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  You have to invent windowing on iPadOS, right?
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  Mac Stage Manager has some issues,
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  but they have decades of windowing, right?
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  Whereas the iPad has none, none.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  They have to invent all windowing to do this feature.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  Which is a lot of just pure programming work, right?
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  Like, just to do it is a lot of work for the programmers to actually just,
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  even if they know, if you have a surefire,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  this specification for how it should work is set in stone.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  It's a lot of work.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  Sure.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  And then there's the philosophical part of it, right,
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  which is like, I feel like every time you say,
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  well, what should happen in this case?
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  On the Mac, you're like, well, we already know the answer.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  And on the iPad, it's like, all right,
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  I guess we need to have a meeting and talk through all the possibilities
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  because we don't know.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  And that happens for like every single use case of windowing on iPadOS
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  because there are no answers because it never existed before.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  Right.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  But then the other aspect is that playtesting aspect,
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  which is I think what you're getting at,
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  which is that you kind of have to try it when you have a new idea like this.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  And it applies, it's not just for games,
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  but if you're inventing a new game,
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  whether it's a video game or a real game,
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  I don't think there's, I'm quite certain there's never been a game
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  that's been invented purely just by writing the rules
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  and then releasing it and it takes off and it's instantly popular.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  You've got to play it and then, oh, you know what,
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  it would be better if we did blank.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  Like, we don't have time to get into baseball
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  and who knows where my Yankees are going to be
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  by the time this podcast comes out on Monday.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  But for example, I was just reading about the history of baseball
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  and Aaron Judge and the home run record
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  and strikeout records and stuff like that.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  And like in the 1870s, you got five balls instead of four balls
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  and the pitcher's mound was only 50 feet away instead of 60 feet away.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  And it's like they figured things out like, oh, that's way too close,
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  because once we found people who really can pitch, that's too close.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  We've got to move that back.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  And five balls is too many, we'll make it four.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  You need to adjust rules for a game or a card game
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  or a board game or a video game.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  You've got to start playing it and then you figure out what's wrong.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  And when you're designing an interface system like this,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  you've got to come up with a good idea, implement it,
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  and no matter how fast the programmers are to implement the features,
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  even if you could snap your fingers and make them happen,
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  you have to kind of live with it and let many people live with it
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  and then sort of figure out where the leaks are
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  and pour water all over the roof and see what leaks
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  and then patch it and adjust it and tweak the rules.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  I really still can't help but think that ideally Stage Manager
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  would have been a 2023 thing and that secretly within Apple,
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  they'd be doing all this work right now as they've done,
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  or at least on iPad, because I do think it's more cohesive on Mac.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  It's not for me on Mac because I'm very happy with tradition.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  You know, the Federighi line, I forget if it was in the keynote
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  or on my talk show, but that basically they're not saying to anybody
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  who's perfectly happy with the way Mac windowing works now
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  that you have to change anything at all or even know that it exists.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  But if you find that you get too much windowing clutter,
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  Stage Manager might be for you and that's what it's designed for.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  But on iPad, it's going the other way, right?
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  On the Mac, it's like a simplified decluttering way of using your Mac.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  On the iPad, it's intended to be a complexifying,
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  complicating, do more, see more at once feature.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  And that's more ambitious and I just feel just what it should be.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  I don't think anybody really quite knows what it should be.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  That list that you just read from Steven is one way that it could be improved,
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  but it just shows how much, through no fault of their own, I don't think,
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  except for their decision that it was going to ship this fall,
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  which they are responsible for and here it is,
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  but hopefully they don't stop pushing the idea forward
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  just because it's officially out.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Yeah, if I have, like I like having new features, they're great,
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  but if I had a trouble point that I wanted to cite
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  about what Apple's been doing the last few years in software,
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  thinking about that Safari thing, thinking about Stage Manager,
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  it's whatever the filter is for stuff that's going to get in the new OS release
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  and is going to be on stage at WWDC,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  it sure feels like they're more confident in their ability to ship a feature
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  and have people like it and have it be good than they actually are.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  Because ideally, and again, it's great that they listen to people, right?
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  I think the Safari URL bar changed, I think,
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  but shouldn't they have had that happen inside, right?
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  Shouldn't there be enough of a filter on the inside for the people who say,
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  oh, this is a bad idea, we shouldn't do this?
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  They're like, okay, well, let's not announce it and we'll work on it some more.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  For Stage Manager, what was their confidence level that like,
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  oh, we've got this solved, we've totally got this figured out,
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  we're going to ship it this fall, it's going to be great?
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  Because whoever had that confidence, I think it was misplaced
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  and I don't know whether it's about issues with the work environment,
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  I don't know whether it's somebody making decisions who's not listening to other people on their staff
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  or people are telling them what they want to hear,
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  but that troubles me a little bit that Apple is making these events in June,
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  I think with some degree of confidence that they're going to be ready
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  and then discovering that it's way more complicated than they thought
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  and that troubles me a little bit, like they should have a better filter up front to say,
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  this isn't going to be ready, so let's not announce it
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  and they haven't done that two years in a row now with a major feature.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  Yeah, the other thing, and I know I saw some other tweets from Stephen Trout and Smith over the weekend
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  where he had like animated or I don't know if they're movies or GIFs or what,
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  but just comparing moving three windows around on iPad with Stage Manager versus Windows 11.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  Yeah. And I know enough about Windows, modern Windows to know this,
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  that the one thing that Windows I think is clearly better than iPad at in this regard
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  is that the difference between arranged windows that are arbitrarily sized versus tiled windows
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  that expand to the borders of the screen, so like are much, they're completely cohesive within Windows.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  It's the same thing, just you just sort of drag it to the edge
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  and it snaps to become panel that's the full height and sticks to the borders
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  and drag it towards the middle to untile it and make it a thing,
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  whereas Split View and Stage Manager and iPadOS are completely different
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  and that to me is a real problem in the overall design
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  where you've got two entirely different modes of putting content
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  from two different windows side by side or on the same screen
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  and that there's no cohesive way to just, it's very stilted and unnatural to me
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  and I feel like if you described what they want iPadOS 16 to be with Stage Manager
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  and that was, what it is was the first version of iPadOS that you were going to make,
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  there wouldn't be split screen, it's somehow now they've incurred, I'll call it technical debt
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  but it's like technical user interface debt by having had this split screen mode
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  that they actually can't get rid of because there are, including the brand new regular iPad,
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  there's so many iPads that aren't going to support Stage Manager
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  so split screen still has to be there for those iPads
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  but it's very unnatural to me and I don't know how to explain to somebody
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  when they would want to use Split View and when they should be using Stage Manager.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  Well right, and you go to all this effort to have two windows be side by side
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  and it's like, well wait a second, that's just Split View and in fact if you turn off,
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  if you're in that mode and you turn off Stage Manager, it just goes into Split View
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  so it's like it's actually Split View behind the scenes
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  and yeah, it comes back to my big complaint which I think is going to even be more
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  when they turn on external display support which is I think fundamentally
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  they're trying to have it both ways where they want, it's like well we're going to give you Mac style windows
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  but we're going to control where they go.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  And what sizes they can be.
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  And what sizes they can be and like I try to make a window half height size
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  and it's like no, it has to be the full height size.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  I'm like why? Why does it have to be that way?
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  It's because the system says it has to be.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  And this is like I understand what they're doing here and I want to be sympathetic to them on one level.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  This is very hard. All of this is hard.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  But on a higher philosophical level I have to say, if you're going to make Mac style windows,
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  you don't get to play iPad games and say we actually tell you how big your windows are.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  Like if you're going to make Mac style windows, you got to let me make them whatever size I want
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  and put them wherever I want.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  You have to do that otherwise what are we even doing here?
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  Like why didn't you just do tiling like windows at that point?
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  Because the beauty of Mac windowing, I think,
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  and everybody windows different, everybody handles their windowing different,
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  but I find the beauty of it is you put a big pile of windows on your screen
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  and you can see them usually and there's a gesture if you can't.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  And when you want to use one of them, you click on it.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  And you can move it where you want and you use it and then you say,
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  oh now I want to be in that window and you click on it.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  It's not that hard. I know it's not neat, but it's like it works really well and has worked really well for decades.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  To have it be that you get windows but you can't make them the size you want or put them where you want.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  The system just won't allow you.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  I don't know what we're doing here, right?
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  It's like why would you go to this trouble of making windows and then say,
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  oh but you can't control them.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Like why would you do that?
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  And yet that's where we are with stage manager on the iPad.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  I don't get it. It seems poorly thought out.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  It seems like a compromise is what it feels like.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  It seems like somebody convinced them that they could do windowing on the iPad after a long argument.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  And then after they agreed, they immediately said, but you can't control them.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  That's our compromise.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  It's like I don't know why we're what we're even doing here.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Well, I always like to say it's one of my favorite recurring things that I like to hammer is that it's not just what your top priorities are.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  It's the exact order of them matters significantly.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  If you have three priorities for any project or endeavor, which one's first, which one's second, which one's third can have profound differences,
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  even if all three of them seem like they go together and aren't in conflict with each other.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  And I feel like where they're out of whack with stage manager for iPad is they've it feels to me and I sort of feel this comes directly from Federighi.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  I mean, I don't know this, but I'll throw Craig Federighi under the bus.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  And I kind of because it just feels like like he's come out and almost said it, that it's the option to avoid clutter.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  And the it's such a high priority that that option.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  But there's no option.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  Well, by turning on stage manager.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Right. That using stage manager is optional on both Mac and iPad.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  That's true. One of the goals should be to avoid clutter.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  And I think that's truly an admirable idea for this feature on both platforms.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  But I feel like it's such a high priority on iPad that it's what makes these awkward restrictions that they won't.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  There's no possible way to get cluttered.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  And therefore, there's all sorts of things you'd like to do that you can't.
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:13.000]  I linked to a video that a guy named Jeff Holbrook made the other day where he was trying to figure it out on his iPad.
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  And the one scenario he got into, he had like a window on the left and he had a picture in picture video up in the top right.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000]  And then there's like this two thirds height gap on the right side of the screen.
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  And he wanted to make this other window fill that.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  And there was no way to make it fill the whole space.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  It's like an obvious space to be filled to have three windows and three windows.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  It wasn't like a contrived arrangement.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  I don't know what they were, but let's say it was like a web browser on the left, a video playing in the top right.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  And you'd want notes in that two thirds height gap in the lower right corner to take notes of the stuff that's in the email on the left as you watch this video.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  And there was no way to make the window fill the gap.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  And it's obvious that it should be.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  I'll point out that on the Mac, if you do picture in picture, if you hold down, here's a little tip for everybody out there.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  If you hold down, I believe it's the command key.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  You can drag the picture in picture window anywhere you want.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  Position it anywhere you want.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  On the iPad, you can't. It has to be in a corner.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  And I feel like this is a similar thing, which is like I'm kind of okay with the system trying to keep my windows tidy to a certain point.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  But like it is my device.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  And if I want it in that corner and if I want it to be this size, there's got to be a way for me to do that.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  And right. I think it comes back to the fact that this is a feature that is introducing windowing to an entire platform for the first time.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  That is like you said, priority wise, but it is a tidying and focusing feature, right?
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  It's go back to 1984 with the original Mac and why they called it the desktop and why they called it a desktop metaphor and use actual folders for what were previously and still technically known as directories in the file system.
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  And the documents files actually looked like pieces of paper with dog eared corner to show that it's a document.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  But when you had these windows and that they could overlap and you could make them whatever size you wanted to and position them wherever you wanted to on screen right down to and wherever you let go of the mouse as you moved it, it just stayed right there.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  And I it was revolutionary at the time that there were certainly like word processors that could open three documents at a time, but you couldn't see all three at the same time.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  And how you switched was different between each one. And here you could arrange your windows so that you could see each one tile down into the left and you could see them and click them.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  And you couldn't magically show on a tiny nine inch Mac display.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  You couldn't see the full width of multiple ones at the same time, but you could see the windows and how they were ordered.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  And if you kept opening windows, yes, you'd have too many and it would be tough to manage them.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  But that was because you opened them, but everything was where you put it with stage manager on iPad.
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  It's like as if the papers somehow magnetic and there's magnets on your desk and you're trying to move the paper. You want a piece of paper or an index card right here.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  And every time you put it where you want it, the magnet in your desk slides it over to the right more.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  And it's always over on the edge of your desk. And you're like, no, I just want to put this index card where I've got these phone numbers.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  I just want it right here. And every time you let go of it, it just flies over to the side of your desk. It's maddening.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  And it's like it like you said, it'd be great if it's optional and there was like a button you could press so that you could snap it over to the side if that's what you want.
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  But if you are a button you could press so that you could just put it wherever you want.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  I don't know. It's for lack of a better word, it's too un-Mac like on iPad.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  And I don't want iPad to become Mac OS. It's absolutely its own character.
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  But the restrictions of Stage Manager on iPad OS should be more Mac like in terms of giving you some way to get precision control.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  To say, I know what I'm doing. I want this window exactly here.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  Right. It's like they're giving you, they say, congratulations, we're giving you absolute freedom.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  And then with their next breath, they're like, but you can't have it. You actually can't.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  And like I said, I don't understand the point if you're not going to let, you got to give people, if you're going to grant free will, you need to live it down, right?
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  You need to let them make bad decisions because it turns out that a mess of windows on your screen is actually, it's messy, I know, but it's actually kind of productive.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  It's a good productivity tool for a lot of people. And then if they want to tidy it up and put it in different spaces and all of that, great.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  Let them do that. But you got to give people the freedom to do that.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  And right now Stage Manager feels like a, yeah, it's a feature where they wanted to be sort of Mac like,
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  but then the iPad desire to override and control everything kind of came back in and you end up with a feature that's just, it's neither phish nor foul right now.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  It needs more freedom, at least optionally. And to go back to my original point, I really hope they keep working on it and keep trying to figure it out.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  Because the worst thing for the platform as a whole would be for Apple to act like they had solved it and walk away.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  And then it's just this forgotten button in Control Center that's off by default and people toggle it and they're like, why would I do this?
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  And nothing happens. Hopefully not. I hope. And again, I think one of the best reasons for them to pursue it isn't just that it's the right thing to do in the abstract,
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  but that there's clearly so much enthusiasm in the user base for the basic idea of the feature.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  There's so much enthusiasm for it. Yes. So hopefully they listen.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  All right. I'm going to call it a wrap. I have one last thing I want to mention.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  I got to say it while you're on the show. Have you seen the other Letterman show on Netflix?
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  Yes, we discovered it last weekend.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  That's my time with David Letterman and it is fantastic. I'm so glad.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  It is.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  And I but yet as a huge Letterman fan, somehow I did. We did the same thing where I even saw it there in the Netflix suggestions and I was like, I don't know what that is.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  I don't know. And we even like Amy and I like watching stand up comedy together.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  But basically, what are they like 20 minutes?
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  It is, you know, how they make like deconstructed meals where they take all the ingredients and they put them out separately and all that.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  I feel like Letterman is essentially deconstructing his show into other shows on Netflix.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  So, you know, there's the main interview show. My next guest needs no introduction.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  That's the big star who comes on your talk show and you talk to them.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  But this is literally him taking obviously inspired, I think, by his experience with Johnny Carson and then doing it on his show.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  He's taking the stand up comedian segment from a late night show where they come out and do the so he comes out and does his monologue.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  They come out and do their stand up and then he invites them over to the couch and they have a little bit of chat and it's like 20 minutes long.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  And he did this. I mean, they recorded these at the at the Netflix Comedy Festival.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  So they obviously recorded these over a very short period of time. One night, two nights.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  I don't know. Not too much, but they're great. I've only watched a couple of them.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  They're really good because he gets to show off a comedian that he thinks is worth hearing from and he gets to chat with them after they do a little set.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  I love it. I love it. It's such a great idea. It's like, how do you do?
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  How do you get comedians on Netflix without the overhead of them having to do a whole Netflix special?
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  And the answer is David Letterman asked them to come on and do five minutes.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  Yeah, it's it's really terrific. I also really love his monologues, which to me have much more of an old 80s late night with David Letterman feel.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  There is something to it that I don't know how he's dialed it back, but he every one to me each.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  I forget how many of them we watch. We're like five or six into it.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  But I was like, this is really more like old young Dave is humor in the style and the pace.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  And it's like, man, he's still got it. He is very comfortable up there, in my opinion.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  Yeah. Oh, I agree. Also, I like to think that even though Dave Letterman was so influential in our lives and he's so much older than we are,
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  I enjoy the fact that all three of us have a son who just went off to college.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  That just I think that's hilarious that David Letterman's son is like yours and mine.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  A freshman in college this fall. That's amazing. That's bizarre.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  I never would have expected it when I first became a Letterman fan.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  But here we are. Yeah, you go to your go to the if you pick your college right, you go to the parents weekend.
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  Letterman's here. I figured you'd seen it. I'm actually I feel good that you're not like, oh, yeah, I watched it three months ago and ditched it.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  So I'm glad that we're on the same footing. But I figured while you're on, I would toss it to you in case you hadn't seen it.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  And as a suggestion out there for everybody to watch, it is it's good and short.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  That's like if you don't need a lot of time, you just pop it on for 20 minutes.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  And when you got some time to watch it. Yeah. Or like, I'm not quite ready for bed, but don't want to come in.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  It's like 20 minutes. If that's what you're looking for. And which I love.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  I love just playing with the form of how long a show can be and 18, 19, 20 minutes.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  And then you can then you're like, yeah, that was funny. And I'll go to bed.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  And also, so far, every single one of the comedians has been terrific.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  Yeah. When I was in high school, I taped late night with David Letterman and watched a lot of it.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  I would watch actually the next morning before I went to school. I just wake up at like six thirty in the morning and watch it.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  And I wasn't interested in all the celebrity guests. So often what I would end up doing is watch the Letterman monologue.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  And if I didn't like the celebrity guests, I would usually watch the comedian. Right.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  And it's that's exactly what this show is. What if it was just monologue?
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  I mean, he used to do a comedy bit at the desk afterward, but it's like monologue, comedian, chat with comedian and you're out.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.000]  And it takes 20 minutes. Yeah. It was a real throwback. Yeah. So anyway, that's my recommendation.
