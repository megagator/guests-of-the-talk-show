[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  Oh, this is gonna be a good one cuz I've been sick all week
[00:02.600 --> 00:07.060]  So I'm gonna sound great ladies and gentlemen my my guest this week is Matt Lauer
[00:07.920 --> 00:09.920]  formerly
[00:11.040 --> 00:14.060]  Let me close let me close the door click I
[00:21.800 --> 00:27.600]  Can't help but laugh and I know it's that the issue is is not not yeah, it's not funny
[00:27.600 --> 00:33.120]  But if you can't laugh at it, I mean, I think it's a good thing. We're going on and I think it's so fascinating
[00:33.680 --> 00:35.400]  the way that
[00:35.400 --> 00:39.560]  This can go on for you know things that we can agree have not been
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.080]  if you describe these actions like for example inviting a
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.060]  Man inviting a female colleague into his office where he then pulls his pants down exposing his penis
[00:54.060 --> 01:00.980]  In a you think that would be enough right there, but you you you could think you I think we could agree instance
[01:00.980 --> 01:07.540]  I think we could agree that that that has never been appropriate right that now a hundred years ago
[01:07.540 --> 01:13.620]  That would be inappropriate and it would be inappropriate 10 years ago 20 years ago. It was inappropriate yesterday. I
[01:14.220 --> 01:16.220]  Think it's so interesting
[01:16.540 --> 01:18.540]  the way that that
[01:18.860 --> 01:22.060]  And it really seems like it was triggered by this Harvey Weinstein
[01:22.060 --> 01:24.060]  Outing
[01:25.700 --> 01:32.060]  In in the New York Times where you know all these women came out against this guy who isn't even that well-known
[01:32.100 --> 01:34.860]  You know he's sort of a I mean he's well known
[01:34.860 --> 01:40.900]  But it's sort of like not like Matt Lauer or or the or the president of the United States, right?
[01:43.260 --> 01:48.800]  Right I mean Matt Lauer literally is is one of the most you know it's the nature of being a
[01:49.660 --> 01:51.300]  mega TV
[01:51.300 --> 01:58.020]  Star that you're one of you know his job title or his job effectively was being one of the most famous people in the country
[01:58.020 --> 02:00.020]  I mean, that's really literally what he was
[02:00.580 --> 02:01.980]  Yeah
[02:01.980 --> 02:06.940]  but that it all of a sudden this behavior that everybody in a Greek can agree is is
[02:08.060 --> 02:10.060]  unacceptable
[02:10.460 --> 02:12.460]  But was you know
[02:13.020 --> 02:18.940]  Kept under wraps for so long that all of it once like the dam just breaks and it all just comes out at once
[02:18.940 --> 02:23.980]  It's just fascinating to me the way that this is unfolding. Yeah, it's it's a
[02:24.940 --> 02:29.080]  Well, so I mean snowballed. I mean, it's it's for I mean, it's not really the right metaphor, but
[02:30.500 --> 02:32.700]  The floodgates have opened and yeah
[02:33.580 --> 02:38.820]  Like all it takes it. It's like one. You know it really is like you know
[02:39.700 --> 02:47.100]  It the analogy to a dam breaking. I guess is exactly right like once yeah a little fissure happens the whole thing just collapses
[02:47.100 --> 02:49.100]  right
[02:49.420 --> 02:52.860]  It's very bizarre I do feel and I'll say this
[02:54.780 --> 03:00.900]  You know and for me personally it's I just stand back and watch I mean I've linked to some of it
[03:00.900 --> 03:02.900]  I don't even know how much of it to
[03:03.620 --> 03:05.620]  publicize myself, but I
[03:06.500 --> 03:08.500]  There is a certain
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.500]  To me a deep satisfaction in
[03:11.500 --> 03:18.620]  In watching these people who've done these took these men. Let's just face it. It's all men who've done these terrible things
[03:19.780 --> 03:24.900]  Be humiliated in public. It is, you know, I get yes, you know and and mm-hmm
[03:26.860 --> 03:33.940]  But some lose their lose their livelihoods really I mean, I mean you're got like like Kevin Spacey, I mean I
[03:34.500 --> 03:40.860]  Was thinking about this today. Like what does he do after this? I mean, he's pretty much, you know
[03:40.860 --> 03:46.900]  He's been booted from everything that he was involved in currently and it seems like I mean
[03:46.900 --> 03:50.940]  Maybe he just he just appears in Woody Allen movies after this. I don't know. I don't know
[03:51.260 --> 03:55.500]  It's it it is interesting. I mean, well, yeah, what does Matt Lauer deal? They all go and join
[03:56.300 --> 03:58.620]  join their own like club and
[04:00.780 --> 04:05.700]  Right now like I could start I mean, he's you know, he's got he's got plenty of money
[04:05.700 --> 04:07.700]  so he could probably just not work and
[04:07.940 --> 04:09.940]  still live comfortably I
[04:09.940 --> 04:13.220]  Would imagine I don't know. I mean maybe unless he's pissed it all away already
[04:13.220 --> 04:17.460]  but you think I mean all these guys who have been accused of this stuff are
[04:18.540 --> 04:25.620]  Independently wealthy anyway, so I'm not I'm not shitting any tears from them. I just wonder what what happens like
[04:26.140 --> 04:28.140]  in this instance, I
[04:28.580 --> 04:30.580]  Don't know
[04:30.740 --> 04:32.180]  You know and and again, you know
[04:32.180 --> 04:37.380]  The money isn't hopefully is you would think isn't an issue like Matt Lauer by what I read was making
[04:37.380 --> 04:42.540]  25 million dollars a year as the host of The Today Show, so I don't think that right presumably
[04:42.540 --> 04:45.440]  He wasn't he wasn't spending it all as he went
[04:46.380 --> 04:48.380]  Right, but pretty hard
[04:49.300 --> 04:53.620]  But I don't feel you know, like if money was all that mattered he would have quit, you know
[04:53.620 --> 04:58.860]  he would have already quit you know what I mean like doing the show was and being that Lauer was was the
[05:00.020 --> 05:02.980]  you know and you can see it with Bill O'Reilly from Fox that he's
[05:02.980 --> 05:07.860]  He's angling in certain ways, you know, seemingly to try to get back on TV somehow
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.620]  Yeah
[05:10.780 --> 05:14.380]  Know what I mean, I mean and that's happened that kind of thing has happened in the past
[05:14.380 --> 05:17.020]  I mean some of these guys they do get back
[05:17.820 --> 05:19.820]  You know
[05:20.380 --> 05:23.460]  And I don't know it's so much about the sexual harassment
[05:23.460 --> 05:27.960]  but I know the you know people who have certainly people who have said made racist remarks in the past have
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.240]  gotten released and then you know, they lay low for a few years and then they come back and
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Yeah, but then there's some we never come back like remember Jimmy the Greek
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.840]  Yeah
[05:40.960 --> 05:42.960]  Where's Jimmy now
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.880]  He's got to be dead, right? I do believe Jimmy the Greek is dead for those who don't know when I when we were kids
[05:49.520 --> 05:51.040]  CBS
[05:51.040 --> 05:53.040]  the National Football League
[05:53.040 --> 06:00.000]  And FC rights were on CBS in the late 70s in the early 80s and they had a before the game started
[06:00.000 --> 06:01.640]  They'd have a pregame show
[06:01.640 --> 06:06.680]  hosted by Brent Musburger forget who else was on Irv Cross Irv Cross was was
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.600]  Was there and and one of the other people at their roundtable was Jimmy the Greek?
[06:12.600 --> 06:16.920]  I mean I can I'll put a link in the show nuts as Wikipedia, but he was literally a
[06:16.920 --> 06:22.280]  Like a professional gambler from Las Vegas, yeah, right, right
[06:22.280 --> 06:28.400]  I mean, it's that's his claim to fame and that was literally like the name like when they put him on screen
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.400]  It would just say Jimmy the Greek
[06:32.360 --> 06:37.280]  He would give you like gambling tips for the week's NFL games right there
[06:37.280 --> 06:43.280]  Yeah, right. It was he was talking odds and stuff basically, right? I mean, right, but I mean he was
[06:43.280 --> 06:46.560]  It's recommending wagers prefer. Yeah, but he was
[06:46.960 --> 06:52.400]  He was effectively there for people who were waiting to put in their their bets for the games right at the last minute
[06:52.400 --> 06:58.560]  You know, what does the Greek say and then anyway, he blew it by by making some racist really terribly racist comments
[06:59.840 --> 07:06.000]  About black athletes and then they had a fire him and then you know never came back. Yeah. Yeah
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.880]  I it does raise a question. So I'm read. I'm reading his comment right now. What did he say? Oh, yeah
[07:15.880 --> 07:21.280]  It's just about like blacks being bred better to be
[07:22.400 --> 07:24.160]  athletes
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.800]  Yeah, that's how I run this and it's very it's very loaded
[07:28.480 --> 07:31.240]  It's a lot of talk about the Civil War and yeah
[07:31.240 --> 07:38.880]  I tell a trade right but it was and and the defense was something to the effect of it wasn't racist because I'm explaining why
[07:39.640 --> 07:43.480]  Blacks are superior athletes and it's like dude
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.860]  Just stop his last name was Schneider. Yeah Snyder
[07:54.720 --> 07:58.040]  Did not only think I ever even knew that I don't think so either
[07:58.040 --> 08:04.080]  I guess I did but I never never never went into long-term memory. He was just Jimmy the kid
[08:04.080 --> 08:06.080]  He had a cameo in cannonball run. I
[08:06.800 --> 08:08.800]  Remember that I do remember that
[08:14.980 --> 08:16.980]  It's a serious question on this front though
[08:17.680 --> 08:19.480]  with these
[08:19.480 --> 08:21.880]  So like with Matt Lauer like the news guys
[08:21.960 --> 08:27.200]  It's sort of like they're just done because it's like nobody goes back and like watches old episodes of The Today Show
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.880]  right, but right, right, but with like like a Kevin Spacey or
[08:35.320 --> 08:38.860]  Louis ck. Mm-hmm, you know that
[08:40.320 --> 08:47.760]  This does something like that make you less likely to watch a Kevin Spacey movie or to watch a Louis ck stand-up special from years
[08:47.760 --> 08:49.680]  ago
[08:49.680 --> 08:52.080]  Yeah, it does me anyway
[08:53.400 --> 08:54.760]  and
[08:54.760 --> 08:58.980]  I'm not sure if I have I like I'm not I mean, maybe I should have a hard and fast rule about it
[08:58.980 --> 09:00.980]  But I don't think that I do
[09:01.160 --> 09:03.400]  I I have a much
[09:04.400 --> 09:09.520]  And maybe maybe it will come around to that because I know that I've not and I won't go
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.200]  I certainly wouldn't go to a Woody Allen movie anymore. I mean the guy's still making movies somehow
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.160]  despite all the things that he's been accused of and
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.880]  And I don't even I can't even I find it hard to enjoy
[09:21.880 --> 09:24.740]  The movies of his that I've loved in the past
[09:26.980 --> 09:32.340]  See which is my sad yeah, I'm I'm afraid I'm a
[09:33.400 --> 09:36.500]  I'm on the other side here. I like I completely
[09:37.580 --> 09:44.660]  disassociate the work from the artist and so the re I actually haven't watched a Woody Allen a recent
[09:44.660 --> 09:46.540]  You know a new Woody Allen movie in a couple of years
[09:46.540 --> 09:52.700]  But that's mainly because I sort of have I I don't know. I think he's sort of lost it, you know
[09:52.700 --> 09:54.700]  like I haven't enjoyed I
[09:55.300 --> 09:58.640]  haven't really enjoyed a new Woody Allen movie since the one with
[09:59.720 --> 10:04.180]  Jude Law a couple years ago. It was like a nice murder mystery a tennis caper. Oh
[10:04.740 --> 10:09.660]  Yeah, I didn't see that one by then. I was already I checked out so my okay
[10:09.660 --> 10:13.020]  Let me let me clarify my thing because now I'm thinking about it
[10:13.020 --> 10:17.940]  I'm reminded of what my my actual philosophy is and that is that I don't want them to get any money
[10:18.780 --> 10:20.380]  That's the baseline
[10:20.380 --> 10:23.060]  So I'm not gonna pay I'm not gonna go
[10:23.060 --> 10:25.860]  I'm not gonna go to the movies to see it and I you know
[10:25.940 --> 10:28.860]  Don't want us, you know, I'm not gonna buy it on iTunes or anything like that
[10:29.580 --> 10:36.020]  If I happen to have it lying around that I've already purchased from years ago. I'm might still watch it. Hmm
[10:36.020 --> 10:41.180]  I understand the print but it does it still it still taints my view my enjoyment
[10:41.180 --> 10:42.660]  just
[10:42.660 --> 10:44.660]  Like, you know seeing what he on
[10:45.220 --> 10:47.620]  On the screen is this kind of gross now?
[10:51.020 --> 10:57.660]  Yeah, I don't know like and so for example like to have you do you watch would you not watch Roman Polanski movies I
[10:58.820 --> 11:01.900]  Know the plants key for those of you who don't know. I mean I write
[11:02.740 --> 11:08.700]  Director of Chinatown and a whole bunch of great Chinatown's his masterpiece, but at some point in the 70s
[11:08.700 --> 11:10.700]  Was
[11:10.780 --> 11:16.220]  Accused and by all appearances as certainly his behavior since did
[11:17.420 --> 11:22.700]  Like drug and rape what 13 or 14 year old girl. I think she was 13. I think I was 13
[11:22.700 --> 11:28.780]  Yeah, well, let's let's just say 13 because let's that you know, it doesn't yeah. Yeah, right and
[11:30.260 --> 11:35.500]  You know went on the lam and has you know stayed outside the United States since
[11:35.500 --> 11:42.440]  You know lived living in France where they couldn't extradite him for years and continued but continued to make movies
[11:44.020 --> 11:46.020]  Like I I
[11:46.420 --> 11:50.820]  Don't know I feel guilty saying it but I've never had a problem watching his movies
[11:50.820 --> 11:53.380]  Even though I think that what he did was a terrible crime
[11:54.780 --> 12:02.100]  But you know the movies there why not watch it, but I totally get your point about well me going to buy tickets
[12:02.100 --> 12:04.100]  Yes, see to see his movies
[12:04.100 --> 12:06.980]  And put money in his pocket, you know, I get it
[12:06.980 --> 12:10.140]  I actually feel guilty admitting it, but I don't have any problem with it
[12:10.140 --> 12:14.580]  So like with Louis ck Louis ck had a new movie set to come out. It was like it's like done
[12:14.580 --> 12:18.700]  It's in the can it was like he was like two days before his scandal broke
[12:18.700 --> 12:22.300]  he was already booked on the Colbert show to promote his new baby and
[12:24.140 --> 12:27.260]  This thing came out that he had this habit of
[12:27.260 --> 12:33.440]  He you know, his mo was he didn't touch women. He would had you know and asked them if he could
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.660]  masturbate in front of them and
[12:37.340 --> 12:43.340]  And then would just the most well, yeah, go also like do it. So apparently doing it on phone calls. Yeah
[12:44.860 --> 12:51.780]  Without asking yeah a lot of really just weird stuff that I didn't realize was even like a thing
[12:51.780 --> 12:53.780]  But
[12:57.500 --> 13:01.660]  Like the company Purdue, I don't know, you know the studio whatever you want to call it
[13:01.660 --> 13:04.740]  You know in charge of his movie literally just yanked the movie, you know
[13:04.740 --> 13:11.260]  Like a movie that they had paid for was was literally like days away from world premiere just sitting there ready to go
[13:11.260 --> 13:13.260]  so somewhere, you know, there's a
[13:13.700 --> 13:18.620]  Shelf full of prints of or maybe if it's digital, you know, maybe it's just on a hard drive
[13:18.620 --> 13:21.980]  But anyway, there's a Louis ck written and directed movie
[13:23.940 --> 13:29.800]  Ready to go that is not going to be released or I guess maybe that won't be released until
[13:30.220 --> 13:32.300]  The heat cools off on Louis ck
[13:32.300 --> 13:37.620]  But I I hate to admit it and a weird thing about this movie is that the written and directed by him?
[13:37.620 --> 13:41.020]  The movie is about like a guy with yes
[13:41.020 --> 13:48.860]  Some it's very weird. Yeah, it's about a woody Allen like character played by John
[13:48.860 --> 13:51.580]  Malkovich who has a thing for young girls and
[13:52.460 --> 13:55.380]  develops a thing for Louis ck's teenage daughter
[13:57.260 --> 14:00.700]  Or I don't know if she's teenage maybe she's you know 20 or something
[14:00.700 --> 14:07.780]  I'm very she certainly looks like she's teenaged but from the I would say like college-aged that's describe her as college-aged
[14:08.300 --> 14:10.300]  Yeah, perhaps
[14:10.300 --> 14:13.700]  Which is a you almost can't make it up
[14:13.700 --> 14:18.700]  you know what I mean like it's almost like you want to go to the next you almost want to go to the next level and
[14:18.700 --> 14:26.260]  Have somebody write a movie about a guy a guy like Louis ck who made a movie about a guy like Woody Allen
[14:26.580 --> 14:30.840]  Who on the cusp of releasing his movie had his own weird?
[14:30.840 --> 14:39.340]  Inappropriate sexual harassment behavior exposed and couldn't release the movie right you almost want to make a movie about that sting Inception, right?
[14:41.480 --> 14:46.760]  That could be the name of the movie it certainly should be the name of this episode of the
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.600]  Yeah, and I think I mean yeah, you know if it had been something more benign just like a like a buddy movie or something
[14:56.600 --> 14:58.600]  like that I
[14:58.600 --> 15:04.280]  I wonder if they probably would have still released it and it's just the combination of
[15:05.080 --> 15:11.360]  The accusations against him in the subject matter of the movie. Somebody said this is not a good idea
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.640]  It's just bizarre. It makes me wondering although I guess like I've been having him having him go on tour to though
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.640]  I mean having him like appear
[15:20.200 --> 15:26.100]  On talk shows and things like that that I this I think they still would have stopped that I don't know
[15:26.100 --> 15:30.700]  I do wonder if the movie had an entirely like you said if it was just a buddy movie
[15:31.040 --> 15:37.040]  Would them would they have pulled it? Is it how much of the fact that the the nature of the movie itself played?
[15:37.840 --> 15:39.600]  directly into
[15:39.600 --> 15:45.340]  This whole yeah, and I don't know like if he's not gonna tour and people aren't gonna like go around, you know
[15:45.340 --> 15:49.980]  They're not gonna do the talk show circuit and stuff like that. Is it worth it to release the movie at all?
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.400]  right and I
[15:52.400 --> 15:55.560]  Know you're gonna take a bath on it. Either way might as well look better
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.160]  Right because like if you want to release the movie
[16:00.160 --> 16:06.800]  It's it you need to do that promotion and go on the talk shows etc to drum up interest in the movie
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.700]  Otherwise you're doing a disservice to the movie and to the investors behind the movie
[16:10.700 --> 16:17.260]  But on the other hand you there's not a single credible show that you could go on where they're gonna want to talk about the movie
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.760]  Right, right
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.040]  In just the movie right like you're not gonna show up on Stephen Colbert and Colbert is just gonna be like, you know
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.320]  Yeah, let's just forget that thing. No, let's talk about this great movie
[16:30.120 --> 16:31.920]  That isn't gonna happen
[16:31.920 --> 16:33.920]  It's so bizarre
[16:34.620 --> 16:41.200]  Anyway, the one thing I have learned and I'm among other things like and I'm following this and I am listening to
[16:43.700 --> 16:48.240]  Women talk about it and I I am learning, you know
[16:48.240 --> 16:54.880]  I I feel like I'm on the good side of this because I there's I don't do stuff like that
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.560]  I mean, I feel like I'm I
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.280]  for lack of a better term one of the good ones and
[17:03.600 --> 17:04.700]  I'm
[17:04.700 --> 17:08.120]  Doing as much listening as opposed to talking as I can about it
[17:08.200 --> 17:11.400]  but the one thing one of the things I've definitely learned is
[17:12.400 --> 17:15.000]  Like here we are two white men who are talking about it
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  I
[17:17.280 --> 17:25.200]  Want to note that because very true it's the elephant in the room but but like the Harvey Weinstein ad
[17:26.320 --> 17:29.680]  Thing was had a similar thing where one of the women was
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.800]  Confronted by him back. I was gonna say backstage
[17:33.800 --> 17:38.160]  but whatever you call it behind the kitchen of a restaurant that Weinstein was an investor and
[17:38.160 --> 17:45.840]  just the two of them alone in a hallway and he was physically blocking her from getting past him to get out and
[17:46.860 --> 17:49.500]  You know just horrible horrible, you know
[17:50.040 --> 17:55.280]  terrifying really a description and that when she rebuffed him he
[17:56.160 --> 18:01.680]  Eventually gave up but his way of you know, rather than like physically accosting her raping her
[18:01.680 --> 18:07.640]  He just turned and in front of her masturbated into a plant
[18:11.840 --> 18:14.520]  Like a like a potted plant in the hallway and
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.040]  You know and then there's the Louis ck stuff and this thing with Matt Lauer
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.080]  It literally I apparently like in the middle of the day like in his office at NBC
[18:25.080 --> 18:28.720]  just pulling his pants down in front of a colleague who he wanted to
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.460]  You
[18:30.460 --> 18:33.700]  Know have a thing with and and all of these things
[18:34.260 --> 18:38.800]  I'm just I read these things and I think I cannot believe that this is a thing
[18:38.800 --> 18:43.540]  I didn't know this is a thing and if you listen to women, it's like yeah, this has been a thing forever
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.460]  like men doing really
[18:48.100 --> 18:52.420]  Really anything you can imagine with their penises in front of women
[18:52.420 --> 18:58.260]  That's the thing. There's a whole dick pic thing. I mean just sending taking up. I mean, I can't I
[18:59.700 --> 19:03.460]  Don't think there's anything wrong with mine, but I'm not like showing it
[19:07.940 --> 19:11.500]  No mailing it to anybody you're DMing it to anybody what
[19:12.220 --> 19:17.580]  Has has never asked to see that it has never occurred to me. Genitals are gross
[19:17.580 --> 19:19.580]  I
[19:22.180 --> 19:27.940]  Just didn't know and you know, it turns out and you know, this is one, you know, and I mean it
[19:27.940 --> 19:29.940]  I don't crusade about this stuff
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.700]  but but
[19:31.700 --> 19:33.700]  And I know that some people
[19:33.860 --> 19:35.140]  object to
[19:35.140 --> 19:36.460]  the
[19:36.460 --> 19:41.380]  Go not objective, but they just they they start rolling their eyes at the terms like male privilege and stuff like that
[19:41.380 --> 19:49.500]  but it absolutely exists and and I I would define like and then this is for me learning like here is a perfect example of
[19:50.580 --> 19:56.700]  The male privilege that I've had for 44 years and counting is that I was completely unaware
[19:57.060 --> 19:59.060]  That it was it's completely
[19:59.780 --> 20:01.780]  common and every woman
[20:02.140 --> 20:07.860]  Almost every woman has stories to tell along these lines of men doing weird things with their dicks in front of them
[20:07.860 --> 20:09.860]  The
[20:10.140 --> 20:14.060]  Fact that I didn't know that that was like, oh yeah, that's happened to everybody common
[20:14.940 --> 20:20.960]  Mm-hmm. I I did not know and feel like a fool. I actually feel like a fool for not
[20:22.580 --> 20:24.580]  Yeah, I
[20:24.900 --> 20:28.380]  Was like that thing with the button it closed his door
[20:28.860 --> 20:33.700]  Remember like they did for the few years that I had an office with a door and it in a corporate environment
[20:33.700 --> 20:38.140]  It was like I I always used to just to keep people out like everybody
[20:38.140 --> 20:43.080]  I wasn't keeping anybody in I closed the door because I didn't want anybody to bother me
[20:44.100 --> 20:45.380]  And that's a Matt Lauer
[20:45.380 --> 20:48.980]  So the store one of the things with the Matt Lauer story was that he had a button installed
[20:49.260 --> 20:52.920]  Underneath his desk like a like a James Bond villain where he could
[20:54.140 --> 20:57.980]  And it would lock his door remotely close and lock his door
[20:57.980 --> 21:03.980]  So I I heard from somebody yesterday after I linked to that and just was like, you know
[21:03.980 --> 21:05.780]  He had to install that and get permission
[21:05.780 --> 21:07.420]  I actually heard from somebody a
[21:07.420 --> 21:15.460]  Daring fireball reader who works in some kind of corporate environment who said that that's actually not that uncommon a request that
[21:17.860 --> 21:24.040]  Like executives who people have their executives who have their own office and typically leave their door open so that
[21:24.040 --> 21:31.160]  Colleagues or whoever can can stroll in or you know pop their head in the door that when they get like an important
[21:31.760 --> 21:39.040]  Confidential phone call that they can immediately close the door without having to tell the person on the phone. Hey, hold on one second
[21:42.440 --> 21:47.800]  It's an executive perks those sort of thing, you know, it's like my office is so nice the door closes and locks
[21:47.800 --> 21:50.320]  Well, well, I so I here's the thing about that
[21:50.320 --> 21:55.640]  The thing that I get is I get the close the door button. I don't get the lock the door button
[21:56.040 --> 21:59.280]  You know what? I mean? Like let's say I work for you and
[21:59.920 --> 22:04.840]  I know that your office door is often open meaning like, you know
[22:04.840 --> 22:09.720]  I not not unlocked but open and I come by and I see that your door is
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.440]  Closed now if you certainly if you have like a glass wall and I can see that you're on the phone
[22:15.440 --> 22:17.040]  There's no way I'm not even gonna knock
[22:17.040 --> 22:22.520]  But even if you don't have glass and I can't see the most I'm gonna do is knock and if I don't hear anything
[22:22.960 --> 22:27.600]  Then um, you know, I'm not gonna open it. I don't know. I don't see the
[22:28.240 --> 22:35.360]  I think the thing the one thing you're not considering is assistance and in I've never had one but it's
[22:35.840 --> 22:37.940]  Viewing people who had assistance
[22:38.280 --> 22:43.720]  the assistant often feels like even if the person's on the phone I can walk in and like deliver them papers or stuff like that because
[22:43.720 --> 22:47.480]  Often they have to do that. I got they need something while they're on the phone, right?
[22:47.480 --> 22:53.320]  So I think there's a there are different circumstances where maybe that comes into play, but right so anyway bottom line
[22:53.320 --> 22:58.360]  Maybe it's not that weird that he had a bucket locks to the door, but it's really weird. He chose to use it
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.960]  Yes, and that's completely wrong. I
[23:02.280 --> 23:10.640]  Have some terrible news to report. I just I brought with me a bottle of my my home home fizzy SodaStream water
[23:10.640 --> 23:16.440]  Mm-hmm wet my whistle during the show, you know, because I especially necessary because I've been under the weather
[23:17.080 --> 23:20.520]  Yeah, well, it turns out I never carbonated it. It's flat. That's a
[23:21.240 --> 23:23.240]  flat water John
[23:23.560 --> 23:26.680]  And I'm not gonna interrupt the show to go get a bottle of fizzy water
[23:27.900 --> 23:33.340]  Because that's how this is where your assistant your assistant would come in and yeah, where's John? Where's Jonas?
[23:33.340 --> 23:39.120]  Go go go carbonate my water. Yeah
[23:41.540 --> 23:46.340]  All right, we're gonna get a new SodaStream ours ours broke. Oh, that's a bad one. Yeah
[23:49.700 --> 23:53.100]  Christmas present. Oh, that's a good one. I don't know if they have new technology
[23:53.100 --> 23:55.100]  I don't know if they have a new model yet or what?
[23:55.320 --> 23:58.780]  The thing that I want to do is get the get the co2 pumped into the house
[23:58.780 --> 24:04.300]  Because they hate dealing with the canisters yeah, I did too I
[24:05.620 --> 24:09.180]  Thought I was pretty it's not that I mean like you go to the grocery store and they swap them out
[24:09.180 --> 24:12.420]  It's not really not that hard but I but I always feel like I get to the grocery store
[24:12.420 --> 24:16.300]  I realize I left in the car and just you know, I I do a huge problem
[24:16.300 --> 24:18.140]  I don't have to drive to do it
[24:18.140 --> 24:23.040]  I can walk here in the city, but it's like taking a bag with these three big clanking
[24:23.040 --> 24:31.080]  canisters like, you know, I don't know it's I feel very conspicuous walking down the city with these with these very loud
[24:31.240 --> 24:36.120]  clanking metal cylinders and it's it's not you need like a backpack like a like a
[24:36.520 --> 24:41.000]  Thing that looks like a like a jetpack. Yeah, just fit them right in there and go
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.280]  This is probably this you know what Amazon
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.520]  I don't know how you send them back like the key with these canisters for those of you who don't know the SodaStream is
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.920]  Is a product a wonderful wonderful product where you can turn your own tap water into?
[24:57.640 --> 24:59.000]  Carbonated water
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.080]  And it gives you control over how much carbonation to put in so I I carbonate the hell out of mine like so like
[25:05.280 --> 25:10.440]  You know like commercial like San Pellegrino or whatever. It's it's barely bubbly to me anymore
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.280]  But yeah, yeah and it's good because you don't throw the canisters away you you take them back to the store and they take the
[25:18.280 --> 25:21.180]  Empty ones and then they sell you know, like it's not like Keurig
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.760]  Right, right. It's coffee things. Yeah, right only thing that you're actually
[25:27.200 --> 25:30.000]  exchanging is empty air for
[25:32.600 --> 25:36.240]  Carbon dioxide right canisters full of carbon dioxide
[25:37.640 --> 25:39.640]  So that you know, I feel very
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.700]  You know, I feel very good about that. I feel like, you know, there's no guilt involved
[25:44.700 --> 25:47.580]  But it is a pain in the butt. I thought I'd be smart
[25:47.580 --> 25:50.760]  I used to have three and then when they were empty I would go
[25:51.900 --> 25:55.620]  And the one time I just bought two more so I'd have five
[25:55.620 --> 26:01.380]  And I somehow thought that then when I'd have three empties then I would take them but I'd still have two
[26:02.020 --> 26:06.700]  That are full so that I wouldn't have to go the same day. I could do it at my you know, guess what?
[26:06.700 --> 26:12.740]  I go I go right all fire. Yeah, because you know, that's the problem, you know
[26:16.740 --> 26:23.260]  And there's also a very sad thing as you're pumping the carbonation I get it doesn't just like run out it sort of tapers off
[26:23.260 --> 26:28.300]  And so like instead of like struggling to try and get that last little bit out
[26:29.260 --> 26:34.140]  Right, like maybe like when the canisters full it takes like I don't know 10 10 pumps of the thing
[26:34.140 --> 26:37.460]  You know pump pump pump 10 times and then you got like a nicely carbonated
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.660]  thing
[26:39.660 --> 26:42.140]  It's squeaks mine it mother the penguin model
[26:42.140 --> 26:48.380]  I have squeaks when it's when it's ready and they tell you like, you know, one is good to two or three squeaks is
[26:49.380 --> 26:52.060]  Very strongly carbonated I go six or seven squeaks
[26:52.060 --> 27:02.740]  But but what happens when I think we've had this conversation before but like I'm surprised that you're that the thing isn't shot off though. I
[27:04.500 --> 27:09.060]  Saw a thing one time a reader do we talk about this there's somebody sent me a thing one time
[27:09.860 --> 27:13.140]  because they I they know that I have one of these things and they know I like to
[27:13.500 --> 27:15.580]  overcarbonate it where some guy open up is
[27:16.340 --> 27:21.180]  He opened it up and some piece of it shot up and hit him in the eye and he really yeah
[27:21.180 --> 27:24.460]  He was all right, like it wasn't I don't think he like lost his vision or anything
[27:24.460 --> 27:28.660]  But he really looked like he'd been beaten up. I mean, I mean, it was like a real shiner
[27:29.220 --> 27:31.700]  You got to be careful. You got to like turn your head away from it
[27:33.180 --> 27:34.700]  Well, you need a you need a helmet
[27:34.700 --> 27:35.180]  Yeah
[27:35.180 --> 27:36.780]  But when it when it runs low
[27:36.780 --> 27:40.700]  It takes you know instead of like 10 10 pumps to get to the point where it squeaks
[27:40.780 --> 27:45.540]  It might take like 15 or 16 and you and you can feel there's less resistance
[27:45.540 --> 27:52.660]  And when it's your last canister in the house, that's just like the worst feeling. Ah, mmm-hmm. It's just terrible
[27:56.100 --> 27:58.100]  Good show folks so far
[27:58.860 --> 28:00.860]  Not a sponsor read no
[28:01.060 --> 28:03.060]  Well, we could think it might be but it's not
[28:03.860 --> 28:05.860]  They should they should be advertising
[28:05.860 --> 28:09.860]  We
[28:12.460 --> 28:15.980]  Could take a break I should take a break right here and thank our good friends. It's every space

[30:51.140 --> 30:52.380]  Right
[30:52.380 --> 30:53.580]  Yeah
[30:53.580 --> 30:59.180]  And and people when it when it first broke people were confused because they were like you may need to hit the button a few
[30:59.180 --> 31:01.180]  Times and I'm like that doesn't make any sense
[31:01.660 --> 31:06.380]  Why would you have to why would it work if you hit the button a few times and then the more we learn about it?
[31:06.380 --> 31:13.100]  It makes sense. I mean it still seems crazy, but the reason you had to it wasn't a few times. It was two the
[31:14.260 --> 31:17.760]  Basic gist of the bug was so it was I was categorically two
[31:18.020 --> 31:18.540]  Yeah
[31:18.540 --> 31:24.660]  Because it was okay the basic gist of the bug wasn't that you could log in as root with an empty
[31:24.740 --> 31:29.820]  Password the gist was that if you tried to log in as root with an empty password
[31:30.380 --> 31:33.940]  It would create or or enable the root account
[31:34.580 --> 31:35.740]  on
[31:35.740 --> 31:38.620]  the first attempt because the way that it
[31:39.820 --> 31:42.740]  It checks it. It was like the logic that
[31:43.740 --> 31:44.820]  This is mine
[31:44.820 --> 31:50.860]  The register had a good story about about the somebody tracking this pseudo could like somebody who went into the bugger
[31:50.860 --> 31:56.120]  Yeah, sort of did it tried to read that and I couldn't quite understand it the gist of it is that
[31:56.900 --> 32:03.500]  When you tried to log in it checks something system like you say if your name is molts and the password
[32:03.500 --> 32:09.700]  It'll say okay. Is there a username molts? Here's the password. They just typed in. Let's salt it
[32:10.300 --> 32:16.420]  You know meaning turn it into an obfuscated version of it and compare it to the salted version of the password
[32:16.420 --> 32:19.340]  That's stored on disk. Do they match? Okay, log them in and
[32:20.180 --> 32:22.060]  I
[32:22.060 --> 32:25.460]  Did part of the gist of it is that you couldn't just create any new account
[32:25.460 --> 32:32.380]  It's specific to root which is this magic constant the root user is a magic concept in Unix and it's so dangerous and so unnecessary
[32:32.380 --> 32:35.580]  For a consumer to know anything about that
[32:35.580 --> 32:42.180]  I I think for as long as I can remember on Mac OS X by default the root user is not even enabled
[32:42.180 --> 32:47.220]  But there it's it's there though. It's not exactly it's not the same thing as not existing
[32:47.220 --> 32:52.020]  It's that the root user isn't enabled and the bug was if you tried logging in as root
[32:52.700 --> 32:56.740]  It would enable the account to check the password
[32:56.740 --> 33:02.500]  And it wouldn't that it wouldn't get you in because it wasn't enabled previously
[33:02.500 --> 33:05.440]  But then the second time you tried like immediately afterwards
[33:05.580 --> 33:10.600]  It would let you in because the root user had been enabled by the first attempt to to do it
[33:10.600 --> 33:16.020]  And when it was enabled it was enabled with the empty string password empty string password
[33:16.780 --> 33:18.260]  which is
[33:18.260 --> 33:19.860]  not
[33:19.860 --> 33:22.740]  absolutely positively not now the good news is
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.660]  it
[33:25.660 --> 33:33.140]  Effectively from for most users required physical access to the machine to take advantage of because
[33:35.140 --> 33:40.300]  Every the ways that you could do use it remotely like through remote login and
[33:40.580 --> 33:46.980]  I forget what other things you could turn on but if you haven't liked the feature turned on where you can SSH into your Mac
[33:48.300 --> 33:52.140]  You know, you could be vulnerable to it by anybody who tried it over the network
[33:53.020 --> 33:54.420]  right
[33:54.420 --> 33:58.340]  But those things aren't on by default. So that's the good news. Yeah
[33:59.220 --> 34:03.840]  Screen sharing is not on by default, right? No, none of that's on by default. Yeah. Yeah
[34:05.500 --> 34:12.620]  VNC I know that over VNC you could that's the what's that virtual network computing what a VNC is
[34:12.620 --> 34:17.700]  That is screen sharing. I think that's I think that's the same thing. I think when you turn on the green sharing too
[34:17.700 --> 34:20.940]  Yeah, it's actually right behind the scenes. It's the VNC protocol
[34:20.940 --> 34:27.660]  So if you have that turned on you you were vulnerable to it by somebody who could reach your machine over the network by VNC
[34:27.660 --> 34:29.480]  So I'm not trying to downplay it
[34:29.480 --> 34:34.560]  I mean you can it it's an officially supported feature of Mac OS 10 that you're allowed to turn on so it's not like your
[34:34.560 --> 34:38.240]  Fault if you're using it, I'm just saying in terms of how
[34:38.820 --> 34:42.440]  Catastrophically bad this could have been it wasn't something that most people had on by default
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.420]  But still that's it's yeah and it's a big it's a bigger even though you know
[34:49.420 --> 34:52.980]  You have to have physical access physical access is a lot easier in
[34:53.820 --> 34:55.520]  Certain environments like for you and me
[34:55.520 --> 34:59.700]  It's not that big a deal because the only people who have physical access to our machines are people in our family, right?
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.360]  but if you work at a you know school or a
[35:03.220 --> 35:07.700]  Company where the machines are just sitting there on desks, right?
[35:08.300 --> 35:11.780]  Yeah, particularly a school. I think kids have kids like I
[35:12.580 --> 35:17.000]  Know that if Hank had learned of this thing, yeah, and he was in a school that had that had max
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.920]  He would have been all over them. I would and when I was in school, I would have I absolutely would have I mean
[35:23.360 --> 35:29.880]  Well, here's any I got an interesting email last night from a reader and and it's a definite blind spot for me
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.520]  because I
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.680]  Don't work I in fact have never worked at an environment where my work machine was locked down
[35:39.680 --> 35:47.040]  Actually, I did I had like a consulting a few consulting jobs like temporary ones that lasted weeks when I used to do stuff like that
[35:48.040 --> 35:51.320]  But any job that I've had for a significant amount of time
[35:51.480 --> 35:58.400]  I've just had like a regular Mac that isn't under any kind of IT control or something like that
[35:59.320 --> 36:01.320]  Mm-hmm, and I certainly don't at
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.120]  the different fireball company
[36:04.120 --> 36:10.600]  But I got an email from a DF reader, you know who I was I was like, but you know
[36:10.600 --> 36:12.600]  It seems as though nobody, you know
[36:13.080 --> 36:19.160]  As far as we could tell it just hasn't really been widely exploded exploited and he said he works in IT at a large company
[36:19.600 --> 36:20.400]  mostly windows
[36:20.400 --> 36:22.720]  But they have a fair number of Macs and that this is you know
[36:22.960 --> 36:27.060]  Terrifying because and I really just said this this is just a blind spot for me
[36:27.060 --> 36:30.400]  It's not that they were worried about like attackers attacking their computer
[36:30.400 --> 36:36.920]  it's it's what about the employees who aren't supposed to have administrator access on their Macs who found out about this bug and
[36:37.720 --> 36:40.300]  Took control of it and gave themselves admin access
[36:40.580 --> 36:47.080]  Like you could use this bug to create the root user login is root turn your user account into an admin account
[36:48.040 --> 36:50.040]  and
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.580]  Then even when the bug fix came out your your account is still you're still admin, right?
[36:55.580 --> 37:01.260]  Let's it's not really an attacker taking advantage of it. It's like the user themselves taking advantage of it to
[37:02.140 --> 37:06.300]  Circumvent, you know, the IT departments. Yes, same thing in a school, right?
[37:06.300 --> 37:11.540]  I mean, it's exact same thing. You can imagine happening in a school is in a workplace and that just hadn't occurred to me
[37:11.540 --> 37:14.980]  it's just a total blind spot for me and I can totally see how that's sort of a I
[37:15.860 --> 37:19.980]  Wouldn't say nightmare scenario, but it's it's a huge problem because I don't even know
[37:21.020 --> 37:22.620]  I
[37:22.620 --> 37:30.060]  Like do the tools that I IT sis admins have I just don't even imagine that they have like a tool to check
[37:30.060 --> 37:35.240]  Hey, this it's check all thousand Mac users in our company. Make sure nobody accidentally became an admin
[37:37.140 --> 37:42.900]  Maybe I don't I never used I've never used those but I wouldn't be surprised if they are able to cheat to change that though
[37:42.960 --> 37:47.900]  Yeah, they might but I I guess but I don't know if they could do it in an automated fashion
[37:47.900 --> 37:49.500]  Like you have to go through
[37:49.500 --> 37:51.500]  You know a machine by you
[37:51.500 --> 37:56.500]  Well, yeah, I don't know. I mean because it just seems like there's probably there is probably a window
[37:56.500 --> 37:58.500]  I mean, there's probably a window that lists like
[37:58.780 --> 38:03.540]  Users across machines. I wouldn't I would imagine they can probably think there's got to be an audit
[38:03.540 --> 38:09.100]  There's because they probably need to audit that right for like Sarbanes-Oxley and stuff like that. So there must be
[38:09.180 --> 38:13.880]  I've just never used those tools on I guess but it's just on a Mac. I
[38:13.880 --> 38:21.640]  I you know, I guess it's yeah, but it's a pain in the ass and I mean in the thing in the meantime before
[38:21.640 --> 38:27.840]  I mean Apple was you know, once it was well, at least once we all knew about it. They were pretty quick in
[38:28.440 --> 38:30.440]  Fixing it, right?
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.140]  but I think in the even that interim like 24 hours if you were
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.920]  assist admin someplace and had a whole bunch of Macs that you were in charge of you probably wanted to try and go around and
[38:40.920 --> 38:47.040]  Set that password and you had to do it on every machine. Yeah. Yeah the temporary work
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.920]  I'm not sure if you could do I mean you might be able to do even you could yeah
[38:50.920 --> 38:52.920]  I mean, you know, I guess you could be and see and
[38:56.320 --> 39:02.640]  To do every machine individually, right? There was nothing you could push out. Yeah to every device
[39:03.200 --> 39:10.080]  automatically right the workaround in between when it became publicized and when Apple issued the
[39:10.080 --> 39:17.120]  The fix at 8 a.m. Pacific the next day, which truly is a remarkable turnaround time. I saw people on Twitter
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.800]  I I mean, you'll see people complaining about anything
[39:19.800 --> 39:20.200]  I mean
[39:20.200 --> 39:27.000]  There's nothing that that people won't throw a fit about but I mean I literally saw people who thought that it was shameful
[39:27.520 --> 39:35.480]  Like I swear to God somebody asking, you know saying why aren't why is why isn't Craig Federighi issuing a letter of apology?
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.920]  Why hasn't he resigned or been fired because it took 20 hours to fix, you know
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.480]  Like I I honestly I mean the only thing the only thing that I mean they did you notice this as well
[39:45.480 --> 39:50.380]  I saw but like that this had come up on a on the Apple's forums like weeks ago
[39:50.900 --> 39:53.040]  Right, and I don't know
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.160]  I mean that you know, it's easy for stuff to get posted in the forums and Apple not
[39:57.620 --> 40:04.880]  Actually see it or at least somebody, you know high enough high up enough to know that it's something needs to be done about it
[40:04.880 --> 40:11.560]  You know recognize the bug and diagnose it and say oh my god, that's really bad and we need to do something about it immediately
[40:13.240 --> 40:17.600]  So it might not have gotten no it it's understandable that it might not have gotten noticed that way
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.920]  But it's also unclear as to whether or not anybody who was in that thread
[40:22.640 --> 40:24.640]  filed a bug report I
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.120]  Don't think they did it just seemed it that whole I linked to that thread yesterday because it was so bizarre
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.360]  that because the the the person who
[40:35.080 --> 40:37.080]  Reported it two weeks ago
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.320]  Here I've got it here it was you know, and again, I you know the Apple forums
[40:44.320 --> 40:47.880]  Everybody has like a nickname instead of a real name. So his name was
[40:48.660 --> 40:50.120]  Chethin
[40:50.120 --> 40:52.160]  177 I can't can you believe I?
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Chethin 176 was taken
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  But
[40:58.600 --> 41:01.500]  He's I guess it's a he I'm assuming it's a he
[41:03.680 --> 41:05.680]  I'll just say they but they
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.520]  They do not seem like an advanced user and it does not they don't seem like they're being quoted
[41:11.520 --> 41:18.640]  It really doesn't seem if you read the the reports that it doesn't seem like they're being coy about it at all
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.440]  Like trying to you know play coy and and put this, you know
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.880]  Release this truly significant exploit into the wild
[41:27.040 --> 41:34.540]  They were just genuinely trying to help somebody who had the problem where when they upgraded the High Sierra their admin account
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.120]  Had been turned into a lot of it. Yeah, they got no they got turned into a non admin account
[41:40.120 --> 41:45.160]  Oh, okay leaving their machine with no admin account. No admin and
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.880]  So anything you'd need to do on the system where it asks for admin
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.440]  authentication they couldn't do
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.760]  There is a way to fix it
[41:53.760 --> 41:59.440]  it's in the thread and it was issued months ago where you log in and the single user mode when you hold command s as
[41:59.440 --> 42:01.440]  the Mac starts up and
[42:01.640 --> 42:03.640]  There's some you know
[42:04.120 --> 42:05.480]  You know command-line
[42:05.480 --> 42:08.640]  incarnation you can do to to create an admin account or
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.120]  bless an account as an admin account from there and then restart and it fixes it but
[42:15.840 --> 42:20.360]  This guy posted well, you could just use this root empty password trick and
[42:20.360 --> 42:22.320]  And then go, you know
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.960]  Once you're logged in as root turn the guy into turn an account into an admin account or create a new admin account
[42:29.400 --> 42:35.440]  restart log into that new admin account use that admin account to turn your old account back into an admin account and then delete the
[42:35.440 --> 42:41.000]  Admin account you temporarily created blah blah blah, but how and then his explanation and then you know
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  This was there for two weeks and then all of a sudden
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.180]  After this came out on Twitter it
[42:49.220 --> 42:54.860]  It became publicized again this two-week-old version because the the guy who reported, you know, who?
[42:56.180 --> 42:57.780]  made this a
[42:57.780 --> 43:01.540]  Explosive post on Twitter that brought this to light said that you know
[43:01.700 --> 43:02.660]  they you know
[43:02.660 --> 43:09.120]  He and his colleagues had found this a few this whole a few days ago and even they when they googled around found this two-week
[43:09.120 --> 43:10.860]  old Apple support thing
[43:10.860 --> 43:13.800]  So people chime back in and they're like, hey, dude, you have to tell us
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.920]  How did you find out about this and he it really does seem genuine his answer was yeah
[43:18.920 --> 43:23.620]  I don't know. I was you know, googling around and I found I found it on a four found it someplace
[43:23.620 --> 43:28.580]  Yeah, you can't remember where but he can't remember where and I of course tried searching too
[43:28.580 --> 43:34.100]  But everything you tried searching for yesterday was all you know hours old stuff bonds, right?
[43:34.100 --> 43:37.680]  There's absolutely it, you know, no way to find it. You can't get past it
[43:37.680 --> 43:43.380]  Yeah, right, right, which is the problem with the foot right, but it really does make you wonder, you know
[43:44.220 --> 43:46.960]  What that forum was and whether it was you know?
[43:47.540 --> 43:53.220]  As harmless as this guy's intentions were or whether it was, you know something where it was being kept
[43:53.900 --> 43:56.740]  You know trying to be kept under wraps to be used
[43:57.380 --> 44:01.580]  maliciously and so I get after so I changed the password
[44:02.140 --> 44:06.280]  When I found out about it as soon as soon as I could and then now we have the patch
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.280]  which I
[44:08.840 --> 44:11.320]  Updated manually, but now has been pushed out
[44:12.080 --> 44:18.000]  Automatically and so that's another thing that caused some confusion too, right? Cuz I got some people, right?
[44:18.920 --> 44:21.600]  Yeah, people got it twice. But also I think a lot of people were
[44:23.560 --> 44:30.660]  Seemingly surprised that they could do that that they can push it out automatically, right? Even though it's not new
[44:30.660 --> 44:36.420]  Right, which I didn't really I didn't really know that it wasn't I couldn't remember
[44:36.420 --> 44:40.820]  I mean, I think I learned about this previously, but I think it's something that goes back to like 2014 or something
[44:40.820 --> 44:44.160]  Yeah, well, that was the last time or the only other time it was used. I
[44:44.580 --> 44:47.620]  yeah, I when I wrote about the fix being out I
[44:49.460 --> 44:52.740]  Said what I say him on during fireball to my memory
[44:52.740 --> 44:59.420]  This is only the second time Apple has used Mac OS's automatic that is to say non optional update mechanism
[44:59.420 --> 45:02.340]  The other was the NTP security update in 2014
[45:04.980 --> 45:12.100]  And I after writing that got confirmation from somebody at Apple who said yeah that this is only the second time we've used this
[45:13.460 --> 45:19.020]  And it's weird because it gave you know, like you said it gave some people the heebie-jeebies that Apple even has that ability
[45:20.940 --> 45:26.860]  And I get it I get why you might you know, you might have the heebie-jeebies over it but I
[45:26.860 --> 45:29.980]  I would think that in this instance, it's
[45:31.060 --> 45:37.940]  Definitely warranted, right? I mean, it's there's a certain point where you really do have to it's the nature of the
[45:38.920 --> 45:40.500]  the nature of
[45:40.500 --> 45:45.620]  Being in the Apple ecosystem is at a certain level. You have to trust Apple, right?
[45:45.620 --> 45:50.580]  This is not an open source operating system, you know that yeah
[45:50.580 --> 45:56.780]  That you could you know assume, you know that you that you see'd all control from from Apple over I
[45:57.060 --> 46:00.020]  Get it. Yeah, and I get that in the old days, you know
[46:00.740 --> 46:03.020]  that it was it's sort of a
[46:04.020 --> 46:06.860]  It wasn't like a black-and-white switch. It's like it went from
[46:08.460 --> 46:12.300]  You know in 1984 when you bought a Mac, yeah, you know what I mean?
[46:12.300 --> 46:14.540]  It never had contact from Apple again
[46:14.540 --> 46:20.540]  like the only way you'd get any kind of update if you is if you chose to put a new floppy disk into the machine, yeah, right go
[46:20.540 --> 46:27.140]  By new floppy disks, right? Yeah, I was thinking about that. I was thinking about that today or today and yesterday, but
[46:28.020 --> 46:34.420]  I've got this so I you know, I have a collection of older Macs and my this perform a 6400 and a few years ago
[46:35.420 --> 46:40.580]  I was playing around with it with Hank and like setting them up to play some old games and stuff like that and he
[46:40.580 --> 46:45.060]  And then there was only one user and he changed the password while he was playing
[46:45.060 --> 46:47.140]  I was playing with it for like a couple hours or something
[46:47.140 --> 46:51.700]  He changed the password while I was there and then and then we walked away from it and didn't think about it
[46:51.700 --> 46:55.260]  And then a few days later he wanted to play with again. We he had forgotten the password of course
[46:56.060 --> 46:58.060]  and so
[46:58.220 --> 47:00.620]  And I was like, I don't know what to do
[47:00.620 --> 47:06.460]  I don't know what to do here and and because there was only that one user account and I didn't want to lose everything that
[47:06.460 --> 47:10.980]  I had it on there. I mean I could have reinstalled everything but I just didn't didn't really want to do that and
[47:11.620 --> 47:13.300]  and apparently
[47:13.300 --> 47:19.380]  The trick was I actually I took if you take the hard drive and or you or you can access it from another Mac somehow
[47:19.380 --> 47:24.260]  I ended up actually just taking the hard drive out and putting it in an enclosure and booting it up on you know
[47:24.620 --> 47:30.420]  Accessing it connecting it to another Mac and going in but there's there's there was a there was a system extension
[47:30.420 --> 47:32.580]  If you just drag the system extension out
[47:32.580 --> 47:38.220]  It just restarts and in like in open mode. Wait, what what version of the system was it?
[47:38.220 --> 47:42.820]  There was like like because like it was system. I think it was nine. I
[47:43.580 --> 47:48.860]  Don't know. He's nine one. I don't even remember having a login for system nine. I just yeah
[47:48.860 --> 47:51.340]  Yeah, they came in like eight or something like that
[47:51.340 --> 47:56.100]  I want to say but I don't think regardless it was it was the funny thing was just like it's it was just a it
[47:56.100 --> 47:58.460]  Was just a system extension you couldn't even you know
[47:58.460 --> 48:04.940]  You couldn't just restart with the shift key down to get around it. No, that didn't work for some reason. I'm not sure why
[48:06.780 --> 48:10.060]  You had to drag you had to actually drag the thing out of the huh
[48:10.060 --> 48:14.260]  Like maybe it was no maybe it was deleting or maybe it was deleting a preference file. I can't remember now
[48:14.260 --> 48:16.900]  I can't remember but it was but I remember that it was you know
[48:16.900 --> 48:20.500]  All I had to do was take the hard drive and connect it to something else and remove a file and then I was able
[48:20.500 --> 48:22.500]  to to get in
[48:22.500 --> 48:26.660]  That was the level of security you had back then
[48:26.660 --> 48:32.260]  So I get it like if your vision of computing was formed in the era when you'd you know
[48:32.260 --> 48:38.100]  Literally have to put a disk in your computer to get a software update on to it that there I get it
[48:38.100 --> 48:41.940]  I get it that it can seem like a violation that Apple can just force this
[48:42.500 --> 48:48.740]  Merely by your computer being connected to the internet, you know can force an update on you, but I don't think it's going to work
[48:48.740 --> 48:54.500]  I totally get why Apple built that mechanism and this is to me a completely appropriate use of it
[48:54.500 --> 48:57.380]  Yeah, I mean, yeah the fact that they've used it only for
[48:58.820 --> 49:03.220]  Dire security patches and you know, I've only used it twice in the last
[49:03.860 --> 49:07.220]  Twice years twice in the entire existence of the feature. I don't even know
[49:07.220 --> 49:12.900]  I don't even know how long it existed before they used it the first time in 2014. That's actually right. I don't even yeah
[49:13.860 --> 49:15.380]  so I
[49:15.380 --> 49:19.780]  Give Apple a pass on that
[49:21.460 --> 49:26.620]  There is the question of how in the world did this bug ever get past QA testing
[49:26.620 --> 49:30.020]  I think that's the big question really right and I
[49:31.260 --> 49:35.620]  Don't know. I it's almost I I I would love to hear the backstory of it
[49:36.020 --> 49:40.980]  You know, I would love to know more about that and I don't expect to hear that from now
[49:42.660 --> 49:44.660]  Somebody may leave
[49:44.660 --> 49:45.820]  I
[49:45.820 --> 49:49.300]  But it's almost so it's so preposterously
[49:50.340 --> 49:56.020]  Stupid that I can kind of see how it you know, I you know what I mean?
[49:56.020 --> 50:01.820]  like it seems it's more likely that something like this would slip through the cracks than something like
[50:05.100 --> 50:09.620]  You know like the empty string getting you into a regular user account
[50:09.620 --> 50:15.920]  You know like the idea that that root and an empty password would get you in is so ridiculous that I could see why
[50:15.920 --> 50:18.500]  It wasn't even like on the list of things to test for
[50:19.460 --> 50:21.460]  You know what? I mean?
[50:21.900 --> 50:25.740]  Yeah, and it wasn't it was
[50:26.860 --> 50:34.180]  I don't know and and testing testing is hard. I mean having done some testing in the past. It's hard to think of
[50:34.700 --> 50:36.540]  every single
[50:36.540 --> 50:38.540]  scenario
[50:38.540 --> 50:40.580]  However, this should have been one of them
[50:41.220 --> 50:45.420]  yeah, you would think so or I I would I still think that the I
[50:47.220 --> 50:49.220]  Think that the I
[50:50.420 --> 50:56.420]  I think that the writing the bug in the first place was more of a crime even though I'm very very
[50:56.940 --> 51:00.460]  sympathetic to the fact that bugs are inevitable, you know, and
[51:01.180 --> 51:07.340]  And I I know how the enough about how the sausage is made with making software that it
[51:07.340 --> 51:09.340]  You know bugs just happen
[51:10.060 --> 51:12.060]  right, but when you were
[51:14.140 --> 51:21.020]  When you're writing code that affects login and can possibly affect the logging in as an
[51:21.500 --> 51:23.700]  administrator it's like you need to be like
[51:24.580 --> 51:31.540]  In a mental model where you're you're programming so defensive. It's not like programming other features
[51:31.540 --> 51:33.540]  You know what? I mean, right? It's like
[51:34.020 --> 51:36.020]  you know
[51:36.020 --> 51:38.540]  It's really the crime you go to security
[51:39.220 --> 51:41.780]  when you go to visit the doctor and and
[51:42.260 --> 51:47.340]  the doctor is you know, putting the stethoscope on your back and telling you to breathe and and
[51:47.780 --> 51:53.020]  You know shining a light inside your ears, you know, you expect them to be careful and be paying attention
[51:53.540 --> 51:57.020]  but when you're having open-heart surgery and they're like
[51:58.940 --> 52:00.940]  Actually, oh, you know
[52:01.160 --> 52:03.160]  performing surgery on your aortic valve
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.760]  You expect a different level of concentration and precision, right? You know what I mean?
[52:09.280 --> 52:15.520]  You know, I mean you you you you want good doctoring when you're in for an ear infection
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.120]  checkup
[52:19.040 --> 52:20.320]  But
[52:20.320 --> 52:22.320]  You know writing
[52:22.360 --> 52:26.840]  Changing something in the code and this is obviously new because it only affected 10.13 high Sierra
[52:26.840 --> 52:31.440]  It was not a bug in you know, 10 any previous version of Mac OS 10
[52:31.440 --> 52:37.480]  Apparently so it's new. So somebody run in and change something or added something like
[52:38.640 --> 52:40.820]  When you're in that section of the code
[52:41.320 --> 52:48.600]  It just seems to me like you should be in heart surgeon mode in terms of your concentration and care and your is
[52:48.840 --> 52:54.560]  There any way that I'm that what I'm doing here that this if statement or this else statement
[52:54.560 --> 52:58.080]  Are there any assumptions I'm making here that are bad assumptions?
[52:58.080 --> 53:00.840]  Yeah, like I don't know
[53:00.840 --> 53:06.200]  I just don't see how hey check if you can log in as root with an empty password and to hit the button a couple
[53:06.200 --> 53:07.960]  times I
[53:07.960 --> 53:15.480]  Don't see how that would is a reasonable. I mean, I'm sure it's a reasonable test case. I'm sure it's added to the test cases now
[53:16.000 --> 53:22.920]  Yeah, I just don't know. I really I really just don't I really don't see how that was not caught by QA
[53:22.920 --> 53:27.160]  I really do. It's the bug in the first place that to me seems so baffling
[53:27.160 --> 53:29.760]  Yeah, I mean I can see I can see I can see me doing it
[53:30.720 --> 53:33.880]  It's like I would think I would think for five minutes
[53:33.880 --> 53:37.960]  I'm gonna change this little thing because it's gonna make it so much easier to test this other thing
[53:37.960 --> 53:42.980]  And then I would forget to go back and change the original, you know, the thing that I did to enable that test
[53:43.480 --> 53:46.840]  Or whatever or make the deal make a change or something like that. That was
[53:47.360 --> 53:52.280]  We know I did sequel stuff and like that was I was famous for that. I
[53:52.280 --> 53:55.880]  Oh, I forgot to change that thing. I
[54:00.320 --> 54:05.600]  Don't know that is why I do not I don't do deep level that's also it's what well it's why I don't program anymore
[54:05.600 --> 54:07.600]  Really? It's also why I don't do people
[54:09.920 --> 54:11.920]  Yeah, I
[54:13.600 --> 54:16.680]  You know in some other universe maybe I spent my career programming
[54:16.680 --> 54:23.120]  But I don't I don't think in any universe was I allowed near the code that lets you log in to a system
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.480]  hundred million users
[54:27.480 --> 54:33.920]  Backed by the most successful company in the world. Yeah, right, right who prides itself on its
[54:34.560 --> 54:36.560]  security security
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.720]  Uh-huh. I mean, you know, it wasn't it wasn't iOS which is I
[54:42.600 --> 54:44.000]  think
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.560]  Limits, I mean we would just look at it from a business perspective for Apple
[54:49.200 --> 54:52.780]  I'm not trying to I'm not trying to whitewash this book as I think it was really bad. But
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.520]  It didn't affect iOS and so
[54:57.480 --> 55:02.180]  You know if you're a business and you're looking to purchase a bunch of iOS devices or something like that
[55:02.180 --> 55:03.640]  You could probably still say well, okay
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.200]  I guess they didn't you know, I don't care about the Mac as much because I'm mostly interested in these other things
[55:08.200 --> 55:14.320]  Yeah, I doubt that. I just I doubt that it's gonna make that much of a difference in their business
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.080]  Yeah, I don't think there's any long-term. I don't think there's any long-term
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.680]  I mean, I would think you know, like if you if you are in a business and you were looking to buy a bunch of
[55:22.680 --> 55:23.680]  Macs
[55:23.680 --> 55:25.160]  and
[55:25.160 --> 55:32.360]  You suddenly had to go up against some sort of committee and suggest buying them right now. I mean you probably get asked some
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.560]  Well, it's somebody the Mac is so big now
[55:37.560 --> 55:41.200]  I mean I even you know and the it
[55:42.680 --> 55:48.520]  The trend of you know corporate IT places opening themselves up to the Mac
[55:48.520 --> 55:51.480]  I mean didn't Walmart just wasn't Walmart just in the news for you
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.520]  Like you're doing pretty much the same thing IBM did where if you work for the Walmart, you know
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.640]  Not like in the store, I guess but you know in the corporation corporate you get to pick now
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.120]  You you know you come in and they're like, well, what type of computer do you want?
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.440]  Do you want to think pad or do you want a Mac book?
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.520]  You could just pick a Mac book and they're officially supported and they expect, you know
[56:13.880 --> 56:19.520]  Thousands tens of thousands even of people to be doing it. The IBM thing is apparently a huge success
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.580]  Van very popular and and has employees very, you know, please are very happy about it
[56:25.580 --> 56:27.580]  And
[56:27.740 --> 56:33.660]  And so since that's going on and since that's an actual area of growth for the Mac you got it and it's so common you
[56:33.660 --> 56:38.180]  Got a figure that every week of the year. There's somebody at some company
[56:38.820 --> 56:42.820]  Who's petitioning higher, you know to make a move like that, right?
[56:43.420 --> 56:45.980]  Yeah, yeah every week of every year
[56:45.980 --> 56:51.940]  there's at least you know, probably multiple cases of somebody who's gonna stick their neck out and say I think that you know,
[56:51.940 --> 56:53.940]  I think we should you know
[56:53.940 --> 56:58.300]  And allow people to I think we should officially support the Mac in our IT environment
[56:58.300 --> 57:04.180]  Well, imagine being the poor the poor son of a bitch who was doing it this week, right, right?
[57:08.660 --> 57:10.900]  Just made a whole bunch of extra work for somebody or
[57:11.660 --> 57:14.980]  Screwed up screwed up their business your business case again
[57:14.980 --> 57:20.100]  It really does seem like something out of like if Woody Allen made a movie for nerds really does seem like it like
[57:20.100 --> 57:21.780]  like
[57:21.780 --> 57:26.140]  Two days ago like you just put together this big proposal and send it up the chain
[57:26.140 --> 57:32.200]  You know your company should do the IBM thing and then all of a sudden it hits Twitter that you can log in
[57:35.300 --> 57:38.540]  Empty string and you're you're the root
[57:38.540 --> 57:47.720]  You're like desperately trying to unsend an email
[57:53.620 --> 57:55.780]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our
[57:56.540 --> 57:58.540]  our good friends at audible

[59:46.700 --> 59:51.740]  When I was younger of I used to finish every book I started and then I realized how stupid that was
[59:51.740 --> 59:56.860]  Hey, if you're if you're really miserable in a book, why I don't know. I don't know where this idea came from. I
[59:56.860 --> 59:58.220]  I
[59:58.220 --> 59:59.780]  Spent I don't know
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.740]  Log through this painful experience. I was like in my it probably came from school
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.560]  I had to finish the book for school
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.980]  I was in my 30s before I gave that up literally and I remember that what it was as I was like in my 30s
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:17.100]  And I was reading some book and and I realized that I was halfway through this book for like the last two months
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:17.700]  and
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:22.660]  I also have a thing where I don't like to start a second book until I finish the one I'm on and I realized I
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.820]  Was like I'm an impasse where I'm either never gonna read a book again for the rest of my life
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.980]  Or I'm gonna finish this terrible book
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:36.020]  Which had hundreds of pages left or I'm gonna just throw this book in the garbage and I decided to do that and change it
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.840]  Well anyway with audible you don't have to do that. It's hey, well, don't be stubborn just stop
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.220]  But you don't have to feel like you wasted your money on it because they have the great listen guarantee
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:52.340]  Anyway, it's so great. It's a great service and I've always said it there are in my opinion
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.100]  the ideal sponsor for a podcast
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:03.380]  Because the only people who are hearing me talk about audible are people who by definition are already into spoken word audio content
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.460]  so if you feel like you don't have enough if you don't have enough stuff to listen to if you've got a long commute if
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:14.980]  You just like listening to spoken word stuff while you're doing chores and stuff like that audible is something you really ought to check out

[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:40.240]  They also do a thing that they ask if you want to recommend a book I would like to
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.840]  To recommend a book that I'm about halfway through but really really
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:54.360]  Really really enjoying they've got the unabridged version on audible and it's a book by a guy named Tom Nichols
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.600]  Who's a professor at the US War College?
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.720]  And he's written a book called the death of expertise and it's more or less. Yeah. Yeah, it is
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.000]  That's just on my wish list for a long time
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.540]  it's it's really good and really satisfying but I feel I feel like maybe I
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.960]  The people who want to read this book aren't the people who need to read this book
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700]  course
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.700]  But it's more or less an entire book
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.620]  addressing
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.620]  the the notion that
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:32.260]  you know somebody who believes and a lot of people in America do that their opinion is as good as your facts in an
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.260]  argument for the fact
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.380]  and
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.460]  dismissing
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:42.740]  Experts opinion as mere opinion when it's and a bunch of eggheads. Yeah, exactly
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:47.360]  In fact word is used several times in the book. I gave the the audiobook
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.700]  I'm reading the book on a Kindle, but they have the audiobook at audible and it sounds really good
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:55.260]  I listen to the preview and it it sounds terrific. So that's my recommendation
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.740]  I feel like people who like this show would absolutely love this book
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:05.420]  You're gonna listen to it and you're gonna be like nodding your head the whole time like yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:11.420]  So anyway, that's my recommendation the death of expertise by Tom Nichols and I CH o LS
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.740]  Anything else on the root login bug I mean it's
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.500]  One of the things that's interesting about is it's just so simple, right? It's like it's like, okay
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.080]  It was a terrible bug now. It's over. Yeah, it's it's a quick cycle to though
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:35.960]  Like it came out Tuesday afternoon. Yeah, and here it is Thursday afternoon and it's basically it's
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.480]  Well over now. Yeah
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.480]  I guess I'm I don't know if I'm a very good podcasters. I do things out of order. I do have some follow-up previous episodes. I
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.620]  Mentioned an app I forget if it was last week or when
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.080]  But it was an app that I knew that I'd heard about from Jason Snell
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.880]  And it was a thing for the Mac that would let you control your bandwidth
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.640]  Usage like so for example, if you're tethering from your phone and your phone has you know
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.180]  Let's say only five gigabytes a month of bandwidth
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.160]  You don't want your Mac to use it all up because the Mac, you know
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.060]  Sort of assumes that when it has a Wi-Fi connection, it can just do whatever it wants. That app is called trip mode
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.560]  I will put a link in the show notes to it
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.720]  It's pretty interesting I've since installed it it still is kind of hard
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  like I still feel like even with trip mode the Mac is
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.400]  just make certain assumptions that
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  iOS doesn't so that when you're on a
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.080]  Slurping bandwidth from you know, something that's limited
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.520]  iOS is better in so many ways like I
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.500]  Was using trip mode just to try it out and like I checked email
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.600]  I swear to God and it tells you how much app how much?
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.680]  You know has a really nice interface. It's like one of those little menu bar apps and it'll tell you when you turn it on
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.120]  It's very easy. You'd open it up and typically it's off and then when you need it
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:03.320]  You just go to the menu turn it on and then while you're turning it on you can limit which apps
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.680]  Get bandwidth at all and it tells you how much they use I check the email once and it used 35 megabytes
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.880]  I guess what I should do if I really want you know was going to be
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.200]  Limiting my bandwidth on my Mac extensively as I go into mail and turn off the preference to download
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.200]  attachments and and
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.440]  Images and stuff like that, I guess no but iOS does that automatically when you're on cellular?
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.400]  At least it does for me at least the preference is on by default for me where?
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:39.440]  Image, you know, you have to hit a little button at the top of the email that says load all images before the image is
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440]  load
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  But anyway, that's the name of the app. I will put it in the show now. It's true
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.560]  The other one when I was on with serenity a couple of episodes ago
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:53.880]  I was talking about this weird bug that I ran into where I use the mail VIPs feature
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.400]  Like this so that you use that feature
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.680]  I love it where you can set like yes set somebody as a VIP and then set custom
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:07.600]  Notification settings just for VIPs. So the way I get email notifications is I have them off by default
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.680]  But on for anybody who's in my VIP list and I ran into a bug or not a bug but a weird bizarre
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.720]  Limitation where once you get to a hundred, it won't let you add anymore. Uh-huh
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.440]  and
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:26.600]  the first issue and I did follow up on a subsequent show was how do you edit your list of VIPs and you can do that I
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.540]  couldn't figure it out but on the Mac in mail you go to the VIPs mailbox and there's a
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:41.760]  Disclosure triangle next on on the mailbox and it lists all of your VIPs and
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:49.280]  So you could just see your emails from one of your VIPs in there. Well, what you could also do is delete somebody
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.960]  From that list in that in there and then that's takes them out of your VIPs
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  And then on I always have almost you have almost a hundred
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.240]  I had exactly 100 because it told me it wouldn't let me out. Yeah, right. Yeah
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.760]  Wow, and you know some of them build up over time like eight
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:14.160]  No, well, here's an example. So for example, whenever I have an interaction with somebody from Apple PR, I add them as a VIP
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:21.120]  Yeah, okay, and there's not a lot of turnover at Apple via PR, but there is some you know, it's it's a good
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.320]  You know, it's a launching pad and and you know
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.760]  There's people who have left Apple PR to go to places like Tesla and and you know other companies
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.600]  And so there's some of the you know
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.400]  A lot of you know, I've years worth of Apple PR people in my VIPs some of them no longer work at Apple
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.960]  And so I would no longer consider a VIP so you could go in there do it on iOS
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.920]  You can edit your VIPs by hitting the little eye and a circle button
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:52.020]  Anyway, I said that before the new bit of information I've gotten from somebody who I didn't know their name so I
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:59.280]  Apologize and I can't give you credit but that limit of a hundred is only on the Mac version of mail
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.960]  So on the Mac, if you try to add your hundred and first VIP, it just gives you an error
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.640]  That says sorry, you've got a hundred, you know, you can't add anymore. But on iOS there is no limit
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.760]  So if you want to add more than a hundred VIPs, just do it on your iPhone or iPad
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:18.720]  And hopefully somebody at Apple is listening to this and it's gonna go into mail and edit that
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.280]  Yeah under to like, you know, make it a thousand or something. I don't know or just get rid of the limit
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.120]  Why why have a limit on how many I know I don't understand why there would be a limit
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.660]  I don't know and it's the fact that it's exactly a hundred, you know as opposed to like
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  256 or something like that
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.300]  You know like some kind of or 255, you know
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:43.140]  Like some kind of magic computer integer the fact that it's a hundred just tells me it was just arbitrary that you know
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.480]  Somebody coding the feature was like I better make sure that this works with a big number of these first
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.160]  So in the meantime, I'll put in the limit of a hundred, you know to make sure and then never got back to actually
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.200]  Taking out the limit
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.480]  Yeah, I don't use it for mail very much
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.500]  but I mostly I use it for the the phone to make sure that I like so overnight I can
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.080]  Turn off notifications for everybody other than my VIPs. Ah, which is why my list is very small, right?
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.280]  basically, so
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.280]  You know, I don't get
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.480]  texts from guy
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:25.000]  At 2 in the morning and I don't get texts from from Dan at 6 in the morning. That's
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  It for my follow-up
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.760]  App the human story is out. This is a long in the works documentary
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  About
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:47.280]  God, I don't even know when they first started shooting it at least three or four years ago, but it's finally out in final version. I
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.560]  Have a link already in the show notes, but it's an app documentary calm. I
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.960]  Saw a rough cut or near final cut at it was at WWDC back in June
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Actually haven't watched again
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  So, I don't know what's changed from the WWDC version of it, but it was very very good. I love that this movie exists. I
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.120]  Have a small part in it, I'm glad that my part of it is small
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.640]  I love the people who have the bigger parts in it
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.720]  I feel like they chose some really interesting people including my good friend our good friend Brent Simmons plays a pretty significant role in it
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.320]  I
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.100]  Don't know. I really recommend it. I really hope the fact so it was a Kickstarter project where they raised like
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.160]  $167,000 to make the movie
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:42.400]  For a movie that's four years in the work and in the works and that it is as truly as professionally
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:50.360]  Shot and edited as this movie and it's it's truly as good-looking a documentary as you're gonna find
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360]  It's truly a professional looking movie
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.800]  One hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars is not a lot of money. Yeah looks like the trailer looks great
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:02.640]  That's all I've seen so far. Yeah, just honestly if you haven't seen us over just there's a trailer. I mean, it's lonely sandwich
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.120]  Yeah, you know, he's the executive producer on the movie
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.200]  Well, that's unfair what was that were they saying I've lost my train of thought I
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.720]  Know what I wanted to say is that I first got introduced to them
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.720]  This is a true story. It was a couple years ago at WWDC and
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.520]  they were just beginning to make the movie and they wanted to
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:34.000]  Get like a half-hour interview with me on on video while I was at WWDC and
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.720]  It was Adam Lisa Gore
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.280]  aka lonely sandwich on Twitter
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  aka the guy behind the sandwich videos
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.520]  Friend of the show, you know the the guy who got Ryan star wars
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.720]  The last Jedi director ryan johnson on this show just a couple years ago to talk about his movie looper
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.840]  Yeah, when are you gonna do something like that for me malts
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.200]  I would say dear dear friend of the show Adam Lisa Gore
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.200]  It said to me. Hey these two guys. I know these two guys. They're gonna make this documentary. I think their idea is great
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.200]  They want to make an idea about the the app
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.480]  Community the Apple developer community the indie community
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.440]  They want to talk to you, you know, and I said, well, you know what we could maybe do it on Tuesday
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.960]  At
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.120]  mezzanine where I had the live episode of the talk show, you know in the afternoon while I'm you know
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:39.400]  Rather than just sit there and be nervous about the talk show. I could I could give them a half-hour back, you know with me backstage
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080]  And of course I forgot about it I
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.600]  Said yeah, just send them over. I
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:53.600]  Completely forgot about it. And then it's like Tuesday and I'm there and they they they come by and
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.640]  I'm like, oh, yeah, I forgot about that
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.120]  You know what? Can we do this another day?
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.760]  And they're like sure, you know and they're like, you know, they were like gonna be there all week
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.720]  Where this is a trap I ever told you this story
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.360]  Ah
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.720]  so the only thing we had arranged for the show was and and I think this is the
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.520]  You know was to record the audio, you know that there'd be a live show with you know
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.960]  I don't know three four hundred people at the event
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.160]  but then the only thing that everybody else would get would be the audio and
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:35.040]  But they showed up with all these cameras and stuff to to to to to record me and I said well
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.720]  um, what what if what if I paid you guys to video the show and then we could have a video of the show and
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.720]  They're like we could do that
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.040]  We would like to do that and I was like you sure cuz I know I'm putting this to you like 90 minutes before
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.320]  before the show starts
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:57.200]  And and my wife is there with me and she's like John you cannot ask these guys to do this and I like well
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.960]  if they want to do it and they're like, no, no, we want to do it and
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.440]  And and so they shot it they did and it was turned out terrific
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.360]  And they shot the crowd at lining up outside the doors and they edited the whole thing together
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:17.080]  So whatever whatever year it was that they're the first ever video of the live talk show from WWDC
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.160]  was
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.840]  The year that this this happened and I got them to do it after meeting them 90 minutes before the show
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:32.120]  And was that the first time Schiller was on I think I think it might be or
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.220]  Think it might have or was it the year that the ATP guys were on you should know this
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.600]  well, I should remember but I don't I
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.600]  Remember the first time Schiller was on the show and I remember the time that the ATP guys were on the show
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.720]  But I don't remember if it would years. Yeah
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:57.400]  It was probably then it was probably the other way. It was probably the other way around ATP was probably first, right?
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:01.780]  Yes, I don't think he was first ATP was the last episode the last live show
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.400]  before
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.200]  The one was Schiller
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.920]  Yeah
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.520]  Is there a video there might be a video? No, there is no video. So I believe it was the episode with Schiller
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]  Okay, okay
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:24.240]  I don't know video of the event is now available. So no, it was the ATP one in 2014
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.280]  Yeah, I will put a link to that in the show notes
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.120]  So the first one with video was the year before Phil Schiller's surprise
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.200]  Appearance. Yeah. Yeah
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  I
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.640]  Will send a link to you as well. But anyway, that's the story. It was these guys
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.800]  That's how long the movie's been in their works where they started. Yeah shooting the footage in June
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.800]  2014
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.480]  They assembled a bunch of the interviews from the movie come from that June 2014
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.240]  and here we are in
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.260]  By the time most of you listen to this December of 2017 and the movie is finally done
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.080]  but anyway
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.160]  Jake and Jed are both great guys. Jake has continued to
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.640]  Spearhead the live video of the talk show
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.160]  Ever since he's he's you know, including this year's at the California theater in San Jose
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.440]  And he you know continues he does a better job every time so I consider him a friend
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.640]  He does terrific work
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.400]  But I'm not telling you to go spend 15 bucks at Vimeo on this movie just because he's my friend
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.560]  Then he does the live talk show
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.080]  I'm saying that he does the live talk show because he's so good and talented and this movie is
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.600]  it the biggest thing he's ever done and it really
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:49.120]  If you listen to this show, this is something that you're gonna be interested in. Yep, and the fact that it cost
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.120]  Yeah, you know if you're a Kickstarter backer you get it for free. I mean you're already in and if you're not
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:04.000]  It's he's using Vimeo's on-demand service and you could get it for 15 bucks and I realized that there's some people out there who?
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.720]  don't like to
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:11.800]  Spend money on video that you you know, you like to use the Netflix you like to pick up videos that fall off trucks
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.320]  stuff like that
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.240]  I'm telling you if there's a movie where you where your $15 is really gonna go to somebody who?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.520]  Deserves it. This is it. You know, I mean like if you're reluctant in general to spend 15 bucks on you know
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.860]  90 minute documentary or something or any kind of movie
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:36.280]  But you're thinking hmm, maybe I'm telling you this is the one because it's it's gonna go
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.860]  You know, most of it's gonna go to to the team that made the movie
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.260]  Mm-hmm, and they could use it, you know, I don't think that the Kickstarter funds
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.940]  Covered the production of the movie
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:53.060]  And if you've if you've watched a video of the talk show live you already owe these guys like a buck 50
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:57.580]  Yeah, exactly. I would say that's actually true. So, you know, you're probably on the own like nine bucks
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:01.580]  So go go cough up the 15 bucks. I'm telling you it is well worth it. I
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.220]  Did the Vimeo on-demand thing is pretty cool
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:11.220]  I think that's pretty cool than an end of you know, an independent production like this can you know?
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:16.540]  Can you don't hear much about I mean Vinnie Vimeo is not as big a name as other?
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:24.780]  Tector, you know, whatever you want to call them media sites that came out around the same time, right?
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:29.500]  I mean, maybe it's been around longer than Twitter. I guess it probably has but
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.100]  It it's still chugging along and seems to be doing well
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:39.860]  Well, I think the better comparison always the better comparison is better than like YouTube. Yeah, absolutely
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:47.220]  And there's a lot of a lot of articles coming in later read some of these articles about these things that are aimed at kids
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.380]  Unbelievable, it's sick, right?
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.380]  Yeah
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.580]  How would you even start to describe it
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.140]  Well, some of it's just like
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:09.300]  It's algorithmically generated. Well, I think is by accident or I mean is weird by accident
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.660]  But then there's a lot of stuff. That's just that's just downright
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.060]  gross
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:21.900]  Well, and it started is not but doesn't but doesn't catch the attention of like their their filtering system
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.220]  it starts it starts with the fact that
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.860]  YouTube is very popular with like toddlers
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.660]  that you could you know
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:34.580]  Take any tablet you want and set up set a toddler in front of it with with YouTube
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:38.380]  and they can watch they can watch video forever, right and
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.180]  So it's very popular it is
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:50.300]  For a lot of people most people many people certainly many many many millions gazillions of people around the world
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:54.540]  It has replaced than the idea of broadcast TV is something
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:20:00.420]  you know that even if you're being a responsible parent and saying a lot of them watch video and and really put a time limit on
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.760]  it and say, you know, here's you know, you can have an hour of TV or 90 minutes of
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:09.980]  TV that TV now means a tablet and the tablet is probably running like
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.560]  YouTube or you know, well YouTube or Netflix, I don't know
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.180]  But stuff like that
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:19.060]  So it's super popular. And so there's money to be made
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:24.860]  From the ads and like you said it's it's like where there's money to be made
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:29.380]  Algar, you know people and and algorithms that are determining what is being shown next
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:33.180]  there are going to be people who try to exploit the algorithm and
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:41.180]  They're doing it with like the weirdest videos and not weird like they're showing inappropriate stuff per se but just stuff that is like
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:47.140]  Mind-numbing right like right? Yeah, you know that you you worry
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.540]  It's like sort of like an infinite jest scenario, you know, we're like, oh my god
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.860]  If your kid watches ten minutes of this, it's gonna their brains gonna turn to mashed potatoes
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:04.340]  Splits the banana splits, but the banana splits was only on for like 20 minutes or something
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:20.020]  Right, and the fact that it's infinite is is I don't know it's working
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:25.940]  Anyway, I there's a link somebody there was a good post on medium that delineated a whole bunch of this stuff
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.740]  Right, and it's just weird weird stuff. There was like and some of the stuff if that's not weird some of the stuff
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.300]  That's like wow, they're really putting money into it. Did you did Hank when he was younger? Did he watch the Wiggles?
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.180]  No, do you ever hear the Wiggles ever watch the Wiggles? I've heard of the Wiggles. Yes
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.900]  There's like a new YouTube musical
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:48.700]  yeah, it was like it was like a show with these four guys and and
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.140]  Jonas watched it somewhat. I mean, you know
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.020]  They sort of had like Star Trek
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:01.740]  Old-fashioned Star Trek jerseys on where the one guy always wear a red red shirt a blue shirt a yellow shirt and a purple shirt
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.440]  And like the purple shirt guy had like narcolepsy
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:19.220]  It was like an Australian show but this they called the Wiggles and these four guys lived in the clubhouse and the
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.380]  Guy who wore a purple shirt would just fall fall asleep at random time
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:28.500]  I was like the running gag every episode is he he could just he would just fall asleep at a moment's notice
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.900]  And that was treated as his humorous
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:35.320]  Yeah, right humorous actually, you know if you're gonna have you know
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.860]  I'm sure there's somebody out there listening who might suffer from narcolepsy and I'm not trying to make fun of you
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.500]  But it was funny on the show. Anyway, they'd always break into song and they and they
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:49.180]  Were fabulously popular and then they would tour we didn't Jonas wasn't yeah, they were yeah
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:54.160]  Yeah, but they remember a friend a friend was like tweeting it was like I'm at the Wiggles show
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.060]  Yeah, but they would get kid but I I don't know if they still tour but they at least when Jonas was younger
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.060]  They played like the big
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:06.540]  18,000 seat arenas, you know what I mean? Like the you know, like one week. It's Bruce Springsteen
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:11.840]  It was think it was the Tacoma Dome here, which is not small like one week at Springsteen in the next week
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.380]  It's the Wiggles. Yeah, right. Anyway, there's like a YouTube only Wiggles
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.940]  I'm not gonna call it a ripoff but it's like obviously the same sort of premise where there's like a regular cast and they
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.140]  Sing a bunch of you know
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.500]  Silly easily understood by toddler songs and stuff like that
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.860]  Here let me do I got one last sponsor to thank
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:35.740]  And it's it's a very near and dear friend to the show
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.500]  Casper Casper is the sleep brand that continues to revolutionize
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:45.740]  Their line of products to create exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time. Ah
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:54.020]  Look we've got Casper mattresses here at the house. They're very very popular with the family. They're really great products
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.020]  And
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:03.140]  They're so easy to buy you just go to the website and you pick the one you want and the size you want and it
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.140]  shows up in a I
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.380]  I forget what they call it, but it's like a too-good-to-be-true box
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.780]  Like you just cannot believe that there's a mattress in this box
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:16.620]  It's heavy enough that you think that that could be a mattress, but it's it's remarkable how small the box is
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:21.200]  It's because they these the mattresses are made out of some kind of magical foam type stuff
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:26.680]  So you take the box you take it to the bedroom where you're gonna use it and you follow the instructions on the box
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.900]  And then it sucks all the air out of the room
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:34.020]  So you got to be careful because it'll suck all the air out and it fills the mattress with air and then it just grows
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.300]  from this
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.620]  Thing you're like, what have I done you buy this thing?
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:43.340]  And you're like, what have I done this cannot possibly be a mattress and then it's a good use for the SodaStream canisters. Yeah
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.940]  exactly
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.780]  And then
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.660]  Sucks all the air out of the room and fills it fills the mattress with the air
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.780]  Inside the foam and then all of a sudden you've got a mattress
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.940]  They've got they used to only have one kind and it's the original Casper mattress
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.600]  That's the one we have in the house. It's a terrific mattress
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.240]  Really really great
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:18.980]  And they're designed and made right here in the United States of America, they've they've literally got a team
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:25.700]  Of it's not like a white label thing where Casper is buying these foam mattresses from some you know
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.780]  No name company elsewhere in the world and putting a Casper sticker on it
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.140]  They literally have like an engineering and design team making mattresses
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:36.840]  I mean, it's it's they're very serious about this and they do it right here in the United States
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:43.980]  They've got over 20,000 reviews and an average of 4.8 stars across their own website Amazon and Google and
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.460]  As they say it they're fast becoming the Internet's favorite mattress

[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:49.120]  Reluctant to buy a mattress without actually trying it over the web that they have like a hundred day
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.040]  Guaranteed thing where like it you get like three months with it
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:53.900]  If you don't like it
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:58.700]  You just go to the website click a couple buttons and they send people to your house to just take it away and give you
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.820]  All your money back so you really can't lose
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.560]  Can't lose my thanks to Casper
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.560]  All right, we got to wrap up. This is the we're coming down the home stretch here
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.040]  What else is there on you on the agenda this week? Do you want to talk about the guy who deleted Trump's account or?
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.120]  You know what? I'm glad that he got his
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.680]  Time in the spotlight, but it's it wasn't that interesting. I think it's
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:29.120]  Kind of risky of him to come out and a little bit. I talked to people I guess though because he's now living in Germany
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.720]  It's probably not I don't really okay. I didn't notice that part. No
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.200]  Then that's that's better. Yeah
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.120]  Because I think a lot of people here would probably you know
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:46.000]  Some we've got we've got some nut cases here. Yeah, and and who like to do nutty things
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  right
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.600]  The people are nuts on both sides though Ben Thompson friend of the show had a piece this week on his trajectory
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.560]  Did you see with about net neutrality and the gist of his piece?
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:03.980]  I thought was very persuasive and it's it's not that net neutrality is a bad idea
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:10.420]  and and as he said almost nobody is opposed to the precepts of net neutrality the argument is whether
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:14.980]  The best way to enforce it here in the United States is specifically through this
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.700]  title to
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.700]  designation for these companies
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.980]  You know basically is the exact way that the Obama administration had the FCC
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:33.700]  He changed some regulations the best way to do it and hit Ben made a case that no it's not you know that the you know
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.100]  more or less that you're you're
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:43.820]  Regulating about a bunch of what bad things that could happen as opposed to issuing regulations after actual bad things happen to to solve them
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.220]  You may disagree
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:53.820]  Yeah, I found it persuasive it made me think about changing my mind on this and anyway, I do think it's important
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.100]  I think it's I think it's worthwhile to separate
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:00.360]  The concepts of net neutrality the advantages of it why it's important
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.020]  from the specific
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:06.980]  Regulations that they're not the same thing that you can be in favor of net neutrality
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:13.540]  But opposed to these specific regulations anyway, it was all very reasonable as you might expect from Ben who's a very reasonable person
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:20.260]  Yeah, he sent me a showed me a bunch of the tweets. He was getting because eventually what happened was a Jeep I the FCC
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.820]  a commissioner retweeted it Ben's story
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.020]  No, oh
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:32.780]  My god John, I mean honestly and you know that I've I've gotten caught up in in some of this
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:41.460]  Truly widespread political stuff because there's an economist at MIT who's considered the architect of Obamacare. His name is Jonathan Gruber
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:48.260]  He's widely considered and and talk about the death of expertise. He's Jen, you know, he by all accounts
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.620]  He's an expert on health care
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:57.380]  Legislation around the world. Yeah and helped set up the very successful decade-long
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:03.180]  Romneycare program in Massachusetts. That was the foundation for Obamacare
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:10.960]  But his name is Jonathan Gruber, he does not a bio from what I've seen have a Twitter presence so a lot of people
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.020]  Whenever he's in the news assume
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:19.980]  His Twitter account might be at Gruber, especially since if you check out at Gruber
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.580]  It's somebody named John Gruber close enough
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:30.420]  Right, and these people are not really necessarily the kinds that are gonna go and do a lot of work and figure out if something
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.420]  Is correct in the first place, right?
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:36.240]  So I've gotten caught up in that and I've gotten a lot of hateful stuff in my Twitter
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:39.580]  Replies from people who assume that I might be that John
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:44.800]  Jonathan Gruber, I've you know, my you know, JOHN nobody who's a J as you well know
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.900]  Nobody who's a JOHN is a Jonathan. I mean, come on. Yeah, right
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:54.820]  You might be a Jonathan and go by John, but then you you're one of the goofy jailer jail and right which is let's face
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.820]  it goofy
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.540]  You're a lesser John you're a lesser John I mean, you know, I
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:09.180]  I think we can all agree on that. I think even the John's the JOHN's agree that that they're the lesser John's
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:13.100]  But they don't but okay. Let's just say that they do
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:21.420]  You know, but I I never got tweets like what Ben got this week from this I just the violent, you know
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:28.180]  I hope you die. I hope you you know, I hope you die slowly and I mean, it's just crazy stuff
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:30.980]  I mean who the hell would write something like that over a
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.980]  reason, you know
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:38.140]  Questioning the regulatory structure of net neutrality and it led to people saying I hope you die
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:44.420]  Right, very strange stuff. The only time I've never had it. I don't think I've ever had anybody threatened to kill me
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:49.700]  The only thing I remember is something like years ago when I wrote a crazy Apple rumor
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.380]  it was like it was when Gore got elected to the
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.180]  Apple board
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:01.640]  and I and when Bush was president and I just wrote a stupid story saying that Bush demanded a recount of
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:09.740]  Gore's board election, which is you know, it's mildly amusing at best and some guy sent me some
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:15.100]  Sent me an email. We got into this back and forth and he threatened to punch me in the face. That was
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:23.220]  Some Bush supporter and you think I'll bet at the time you were like wow this guy this is nuts and you probably showed
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:25.220]  It to your wife and you're like, this is nuts, right?
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:29.340]  And now in hindsight you think well that was reasonable political discourse
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.040]  There two things now remember the good old days
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.780]  Right. That was chose a charming exchange. We had
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:42.040]  Such a witty repartee two fellow citizens could could have a
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:47.540]  Reasonable discussion and a threat to punch the other one in a face. That's all
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:55.160]  Oh, it's really were the good old days. Oh, well, thank you John with an H
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.060]  As always you John with an H for appearing on the show
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840]  Everybody can enjoy your work
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.540]  Well, you got podcast. What do you want to what do you want to pitch? I've got
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.860]  turning this car around podcast with a lesser John and and this other guy and
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:20.660]  And and then the rebound with Dan Warren and the same other guy. Yeah, so that's a good one
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:25.900]  Yeah, that's a good. There's still money in podcasting. Oh, yeah. There's no money. There's no money in blogging anymore. He took
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:35.380]  My thanks also to our three sponsors of this episode Squarespace audible and Casper
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:41.940]  My thanks to them John as always it was a pleasure. Thank you
