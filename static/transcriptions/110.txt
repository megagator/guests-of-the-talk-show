[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  You still there?
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  Oh yeah.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.000]  You know what it did?
[00:03.000 --> 00:05.000]  Oh, you sound so much better.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.000]  You know what it did?
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  I plugged it into a different USB port.
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  I think this is probably the last episode of a cord using this old air.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  Oh, are you going to go to the new iMac?
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  No.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  I guess I should.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  I don't know why.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  I don't record using the iMac.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  I don't know.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  Yeah.
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  The air is powerful enough to do that?
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  It's probably why the show sounds like shit.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  No.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  No.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  You know what?
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  And I actually know that this old MacBook Air that I've used, I do it because in some ways
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm a sentimental idiot.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  And I think I've recorded like every episode of the talk show for, I don't know,
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  at least the last three or four years using that air.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  So I want to keep doing it.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  Yeah.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  I mean, you said...
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  It makes no technical sense.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  No, not at all.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  But you said not too long ago how in baseball fans there are people who are into the numbers
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  and people who are into the story and that you're a story guy.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Right.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  And, you know, the MacBook Air has got a story.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  When I stopped using my road, I was pretty nervous because I was like, I've been using
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  this since 43 folders.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  Break weekly.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Like, you know, it's so dumb.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  I'm just changing to a better mic.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  Why would that matter?
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.000]  It shouldn't.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  But I felt like a little bit this loyal.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  What did you switch to?
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Well, I tried a couple of things.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  I'm using a sure SM7B.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  No, it's got a... it's super annoying because I got to go through a...
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  this pre-sonus thing.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  Oh, I don't want that.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  I think Marco was telling me about that.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  You know, I think I just listened to too much rock music.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  When people have these conversations about stuff, I just...
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  I just don't hear it.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  I don't hear what they're talking about.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  It makes me feel like a charlatan.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  I mean, I can notice in production values,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  like when like the public radio show with a budget sounds
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  different than three guys talking about Linux.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  But like, I don't notice that much about mics and stuff to you.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  No, I don't.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  Yeah, you're gonna listen to a lot of podcasts though.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  Oh, I... I mean, I don't listen to a lot,
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  but I listen to enough.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  But when I do, I'm listening with earbuds.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  So, you know, I don't think...
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  And a lot of times, I would say,
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  easily 85% of the time I'm listening to podcasts,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I'm walking through the city.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  So, there's so much noise.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  You know, it's the quality of the mic.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  I mean, you know, I understand why people make it sound as good as they can,
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  but I could never hear the difference between microphones.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  Did you...
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  Did you ever get your driver's license back?
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I didn't lose my driver's license back.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  You probably don't remember.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  It was on an episode of the talk show with Dan,
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  and you had the holiday party.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's my favorite episode of the talk show.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  And he talked about how they took your license away.
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  You probably don't remember that.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  It was the holiday season.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's a lot to remember.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  Why did they take my license away?
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Oh, I made it out.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  I made it out.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  That's right.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  Now I remember.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  Oh, God, now I remember.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  Because you had so many points.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  Right.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  And you refused to go to traffic school.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  And Dan, you know, to Dan's credit,
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  he played the entire episode straight.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  It was really funny.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  Oh, that was a good...
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  That was HR, HR, fluffy puff.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah, and I got...
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  Oh, I should write that down for the show notes.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  I got...
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  I think most people got it,
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  but I definitely got a fair amount of email
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  from listeners who were telling me,
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  hey, you know, you got a...
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  Maybe you ought to get some help.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  That's so...
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  You know, that's not funny.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  It's not funny racking up all those points, you know.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  You know how that hurts the government?
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  Well, you know, you're going to learn a lesson in it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  When you hit a kid, you know, crossing the streets or something.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  Christ saves John, you got a kid.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  Jesus Christ.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  You know, I'm so tired of words.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  I'm just going to stop saying things.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  It's just...
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  I give up.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  I give up.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  I'm just going to make grunts,
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  and maybe like sing a little hum a little tune.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  But you know, no matter what you say,
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  I mean, a crack last night on the Twitter
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  about how I wish Netflix in streaming
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  five seasons of mesh, the five good seasons of mesh,
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  how I wish they would have it without the left track.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  Oh, my God.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  I got so many responses from people on the one hand
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  telling me how that's physically impossible
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  since it's hard-coded.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  And then other people going,
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  Sir, did you know that's your code?
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  The DVD tracks.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  I was like, yeah, you know what?
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  I know all of that.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  I know all of that.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  I was just making a joke.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  It's just...
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  It's an ephemeral comment.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's okay.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  Everything's going to be fine.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  You must get that to the 10th power,
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  especially when you're being jokey about
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  whatever sports or technology.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  You must...
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  You must get so many wackadoodle responses
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  from people.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Yeah.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  It goes and flows.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  I can never predict, though.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  Like, I'll post some kind of, you know,
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  absurd tweet and I think, oh, God,
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  I'm going to get so many people who take this seriously
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  and then there's nothing.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  And then I throw one out
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  but I'm not even worried about
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  and everybody, you know.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  John, there is absolutely no way to know.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  I make a lot of news related to your mother jokes.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  And every time I expect incredible blowback,
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  nothing.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  That's fine.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  That's awesome.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.000]  I make one crack about mesh having a left track
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  and like the entire peanut gallery rises as one.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  But, you know, it's good.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  I'm just tired of words.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  What was the deal with mesh's left track?
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  The way I recall it is season one,
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  there was no left track.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  And it was a ratings...
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  It was precipitous that it was like,
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  the ratings were so bad that it was on a border
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  of not coming back for another season
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  and that one of the changes they made
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  between season one, season two,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  is they added a left track.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Yeah, I remember having read,
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  because amongst people who have enjoyed the mesh show,
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  it's a pretty hot topic.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Because you can, on the DVDs,
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  I don't own the DVDs.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  I hate DVDs.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  I hate physical media.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  I don't want to miss my house.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  I mean, that's three.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  That's my quarter of a last resort.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  Like, I've got all the James Bond films
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  like everybody.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  You know, I bought that $100 Blu-ray package.
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.000]  I got that.
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  I got the Godfather and then I think I got a Dora
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000]  or something like that.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.000]  But that's about it.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  But yeah, they had an alternate track
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  where you could have the audio
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  without the left track.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  I don't remember exactly how it happened,
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  except, I mean, think about the time.
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  What is that, 72, 73?
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.000]  Something like that.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  Where every, every like three camera sitcom
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  had a live audience.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  Like, you got your own, the families and stuff.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  And I think, you know,
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  it probably seemed a little dead to people.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  And some of the humor is probably a little bit dry.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  It's just, it suddenly became not very dry,
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  when there's a very obvious laugh on it.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  I just, I really hate laugh tracks.
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  They just, they drive me crazy.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  And you can actually go and, you know,
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  if you know where to go,
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  I know you don't do these things,
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  but you can find copies of it.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  And it is actually a pretty different experience.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  So you go watch my favorite episode,
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  Abyssinia Henry,
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  the one where Henry leaves.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  Do you remember that episode?
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  It's the end of season three.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  I'm just going through this.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  I'm sure he dies.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  He gets shot out of the air.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  And it's the episode right before Trapper leaves.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  It was the end of the season.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  And it's got that amazing scene at the end
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  where radar walks into the operating room
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  and reads the notice that Henry's dead.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  It's incredibly moving.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  And watching that episode without the laugh track
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.000]  is a real different thing.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Cause it's one of the great episodes of TV.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  And, you know, you know it's good.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  Maybe in a way that people at that time wouldn't know it's good.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  So it feels a little insulting, you know,
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  to have to put all of that on.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  And it's not super loud like on some shows,
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  like 90 shows where the laugh track got so loud.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  Yeah, but it always felt to me,
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  even as a kid and growing up in an era
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  when all sitcoms had laugh tracks
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  or it's live studio audience.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.000]  And even though it's a live studio audience,
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  you know that they laughed pretty loud sometimes.
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.000]  Yeah.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  It always seemed incongruous
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  because it clearly was not shot
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  in front of a live studio audience.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  It was shot on real, you know.
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  Like a sound state.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  Yeah.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Like, you know, in that case of mash,
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  it's like the shooting at outdoors.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  There's not people on bleachers there.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  Right.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  And the production values were always such.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  I mean, clearly in hindsight,
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  I mean, everybody knew it was a smash hit.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  Eventually it became a smash hit, you know,
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  after a couple of seasons.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  And it was, you know, like,
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.000]  it was always like,
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  I think it was always like number one or number two
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  was 60 minutes.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.000]  You know, it was always like a fight
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  which was going to be the top rated show of the week
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  and at a time.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.000]  60 minutes, man.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  That was a juggernaut.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  Remember that was just like almost always.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  It was it was 60 minutes
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  or something else for a little while.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  It was always 60 minutes.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  It was always number one or number two.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  It felt like your civic obligation as an American
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  was Sunday night at seven.
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  Everybody, you know,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  from seven to 70 would sit down and watch 60 minutes.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  Mm-hmm.
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  Yeah.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  The other thing that's funny about mash is,
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  you know, it sounds nasty.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  I don't mean it to be,
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  but it's funny the, you know,
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  like three of the stars of that show left
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  because they wanted a better deal
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  or they wanted more attention.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  You know, Wayne Rogers as Trapper,
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  McLean Stevenson, you know,
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  he was done with it and later on Larry Linville
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  had decided he was done with the Frank Burns character
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  and, you know,
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  none of them ever found anything approaching that again.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's such a bummer.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Oh, what was the guy who replaced Frank Burns?
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  Winchester, right?
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  Oh, yeah, right.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Yeah.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  He was it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  Yeah, and he was, there was stuff.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  It was a tough one because
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  you could tell Winchester was actually a good surgeon.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Yeah.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  Frank was a, you know,
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  yeah.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  It was a good show.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  It was good.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  That is interesting.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  It's interesting in so many ways.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  It was a good movie that started it
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  and then they, you know, didn't have any of the characters,
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  you know, any of the same actors from the movie.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  He had, uh, Gary Burgoff was in the movie.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  Oh, right.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  Radar.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Radar.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  Yeah.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  And the first season is much closer
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  in the kind of anarchic spirit.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Yeah.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  It was much closer to the first to the film.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  But yeah, it got, you know, like anything
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  though, I think they kind of, they started,
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  you know, this great thing that was a great episode
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  where Hawkeye writes to his dad.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  It was an episode called Dear Dad.
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  I remember that one.
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  I remember this.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  It was really good.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  It's from like, I don't know, for a second season.
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  And, but then they did like,
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  remember then they had like, dear peg,
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  and then they had dear, um,
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000]  Father Mookay.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  He writes in eventually, um,
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  Alan Arbus, remember the psychiatrist?
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  He's writing to Sigmund Freud
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  at some point, like, like an open letter or something.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  It got really bananas.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  But it was a good show.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  I mean, it was, it was really of its time.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  But by the end, it was just, it was so insufferable.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  Even as a flaming liberal,
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  I can't watch that show.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  It's, it's such a pan of mine of, you know, politics.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  I haven't seen it in a long time.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  I don't, I don't, I remember it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  It peedering out at toward the end.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  And I remember the last episode was,
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  it was the back.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.000]  With the chicken.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  Oh, I just, and Hawkeye still haunts me.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Still haunts me.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  Committed or something.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  And yeah, because of the chicken.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  I was no chicken.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  I don't know.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  I was always obsessed.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  That's another like lifelong obsession of session for me.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  Like a minor one is final episodes of shows.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  I'll watch the last episode of a show that I've never even watched
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  just to see how, you know, I like a last episode.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  Yeah.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  And I, I watched Mash.
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  I, you know, I watched it.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  I watched the reruns, you know, it was a staple in our household.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  Like flipping through the stations, like waiting for dinner
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  to be ready.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Everybody could agree we'd watch Mash, you know,
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  and the reruns were, you know, like five or 30 or something like that.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  So it was, you know, and the reruns were on while the show was still
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  wrapping up, I think.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  Absolutely.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  Yeah.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I think their last episode for a long time was the
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  highest rated like non-superbowl type.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  Yeah.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  Definitely was.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  Yeah.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  Yeah.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.000]  It was like a national event.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  And everybody was like, what the hell was that?
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  It kind of went on.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  Yeah.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  Was it played now like watching any of those episodes with
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  Jamie Far's character?
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  What was his name?
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  Clinger.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  Clinger.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  Clinger.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  How could I forget that?
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  So Clinger, for anybody who's in familiar,
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  Clinger was played by Jamie Far and he did not want to serve in the army.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  Yeah.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  He was drafted.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  He was drafted.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  He never knew what these kids.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  And he knew that there was something that you could get if you were
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  mentally unsound to serve in the army.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  He didn't get a section eight or something.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  Section eight.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  So he's always angling for a section eight.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  So how do you convince the army that you're crazy?
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  You dress like Carmen Miranda.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  You wear women's clothes.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  Right.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  So he wore women's clothing all the time and didn't work.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Everybody knew what his stick was.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  But he'd never let up on it.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  He stole it.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  He stole it his job.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  He showed up dressed like a nurse.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  But then he was a pretty good nurse.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  That's part of the problem.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  I think you should undermine the basic task that you're
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  doing or do them in such a banana's way that it's clear that
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  you're crazy.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Right.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  You know, it's OK.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  The earlier seasons are better.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  You know, it's so funny with TV shows.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  It always takes them a few episodes or a season to find their legs
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  and then, you know, things kind of seem to go for a while.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  I can't imagine doing a TV show.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  It just seems so exhausting.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  Oh, totally.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  Of any kind.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Yeah.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  Whether it's, you know, like, like,
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  like, well, like, this very day, like, yes, last night was,
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  as we record yesterday was the day John Stewart announced
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  that he was going to step down from the daily show.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  And then it's like, he said something during the show.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  Did you watch?
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  I watched and it was like, no.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  What do you say?
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  I think he said he's been doing it for 17 years.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  And I looked at it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  I was watching with Amy and I was like,
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  well, that can't be.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  And then I was like, think of him.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  I was like, oh, shit.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And then I'm like, well, of course he's going to step down.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  He's been doing this show four days a week for 17 years.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Yeah.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And I know, I mean, talking to in particular,
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Hodgman and Rob Cordry about it,
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  people I know who've been on that show and worked with him
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  all say the same thing, which is that the first of all,
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  he's a very nice guy.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  And, you know, he's a good guy,
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  but also that he is one of the hard,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  he's the hardest working person in the building.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  So when Hodgman will go on there,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  he would have like kind of a prepared bit.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  And then I mean, you know, he's,
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  I don't think he was the show runner,
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  but he, he was involved in like,
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  every rewrite up until, I mean,
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  he was making everybody in the room better on every episode.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  Can you imagine doing that for over 15 years,
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  like what that would take out of you?
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  No.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And I think that I have trouble ordering groceries.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And this guy is doing that every single night,
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  unbelievable.
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  I think it's very clear too that he, you know,
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  and it put it in sports ball terms.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  He's a good, he was like a good passer in basketball.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  Like he was not concerned.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  Obviously he's the host of the show.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  He's, you know, the one who does the whole,
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  first half single handedly on on air at least.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  Obviously with the help of writers.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  But as soon as anybody else is on,
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  whether it's a bit at the desk, like a Hodgman thing
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  or anything else,
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  he is so 100% concentrated on making that other person
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  look as good as they possibly can.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  And make sure that they get as many of the laughs
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  as they possibly can.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  I totally agree.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  And I mean, you can look to our hero.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  And it's like the paragon of that.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  Carson was so good.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  Whoever that was.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  Like whether that was burr Reynolds
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  or whether that was some grandmother
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  that had done something crazy.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  He was so generous.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  I mean, I think even if he wasn't loving,
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  I think Fred Decortova would be the one
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  who kind of step in and go,
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  okay, we're ready to go to commercial.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Carson was sometimes, you know,
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  given the hand signal.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  But he was, I mean, he was there
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  and fully committed to whatever was happening
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  and wanted to make that person look good
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  and it made everybody look good.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  So I was surprised.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  I have to say like just to commit
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  to about the whole late night shuffling.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  I was a little surprised when Letterman
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  announced his retirement that John Stewart
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  didn't get that or maybe he didn't want it.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  I, you know, if he was thinking
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  about stepping down from this, you know,
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  on a daily basis,
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  maybe that's just it he didn't want to, you know,
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  he just didn't want to do a daily show anymore.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  I always thought that John Stewart
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  would be an excellent, you know,
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  like Letterman's style show host.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  I agree.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  And, you know, it's funny to think about like
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  what the world was like when Letterman started
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  and it would be impossible to explain to somebody today
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  probably in the same way that Steve Allen
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  like to us, Steve Allen seems like an old guy.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  But Steve Allen's show broke the mold.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  I mean, there'd never been anybody on TV
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  quite like Steve Allen who was so kind of, you know,
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  cultural and witty and smart, but also so
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  would do such crazy stunts
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  and that had a huge influence on Letterman.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  And then Letterman comes along and, you know,
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  they had that crazy deal with Carson, you know,
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  about all this, right?
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  Like there was, they had a very,
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  they had a guy from Carson's production team there
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  who basically made sure that he's like,
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  okay, here's your show.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  Here's the rules.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  Like you can't book anybody who's like
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.000]  one of Johnny's regulars.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  You know, Johnny gets the first bite
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  of any of these particular apples.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  All kinds of rules.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  But that was a constraint that he worked
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  and brought in Larry Bud Millman
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  or he brought in Chris Elliott
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  and that made the show so much more fun
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  and so much weirder than if that
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  awkward young David Letterman was trying
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  to interview, you know, Madonna at that.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  Yeah, I think most famously
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  there were restrictions on the length of the monologue.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  Oh, really?
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.000]  Oh, because that's Johnny's thing.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  Yeah, it was Johnny's thing.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  And so like on the old Letterman show,
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  Letterman would come out and do three jokes
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  and they were so perfunctory.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Like the bit was almost like his complete
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  disdain for the monologue.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  He would just come out and do three really
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  clipped perfunctory jokes
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  and then it was on to the desk and the rest.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  And you know, the part that made it
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  the part that made it funny every night
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  was how terrible he made it
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  seen like he thought it was.
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  Like that was a terrible joke.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  And him adjusting his tie and like
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  the kind of face, you know, that's what made it funny.
[17:48.000 --> 17:48.000]  Right.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  So like they took the restrictions from
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Carson Productions on the monologue
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  and I think eventually like I think once
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  it settled in and it was very clear.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  I don't think it took long for Carson
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  and his people to realize that Letterman
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  was no threat to Carson.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  Like there was no way that that Letterman
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  was ever going to steal his job.
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  Right.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  Right.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  He's just not that type of person.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  And you know, he was fine.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  You know, I think, you know, famously he
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  wanted it when the time came
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  and when Johnny retired.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  But he was never going to backstab him
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  if his ratings had, you know,
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  if he's never seen anything like
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  completely grateful.
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  Like he tells the story.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  I guess the first time he was on
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  and got called over to the couch.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  Like he honestly, he still sounds like a kid.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  Like what a, what a moving moment that
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  was for him to get to do that.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  Yeah.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  So I think that eventually I don't think
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  it took long where if he had wanted
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  to do longer monologues,
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  I don't really think that the phone
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  is going to ring in the Carson people.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  We're going to say, hey, you know,
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  you know, you're, you know,
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  you're only supposed to do two minutes
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  of monologue and you did two thirty last night.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  But I think that they just embraced
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  that anti monologue, you know,
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  that that just became part of the
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  signature of the show.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  Well, yeah.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  And I mean, that's a beat.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  It's a death.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  But I think about the stuff that I remember
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  when I would hear somebody was going to be on,
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  I would get so excited.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  And certainly there's famous scenes
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  where like Drew Barry Moore acted all crazy
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  or Crispin Glover was all, you know,
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  nuts that one time and tried to,
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  because I was going to kick him.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  Those are famous.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  But what do you really remember
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  from the first three years?
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  I mean, you, you remember people like Harvey
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Peacar, you remember people like Charles Grodon.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  You remember, you remember people being
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.000]  on there who, or like Jeff Altman.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  I love Jeff Altman.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  Like he would be so very 20 pound butt stake.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  You know, and that's what made the show.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  And then like the prancing fluids
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  and all that stuff that was the product
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  of that probation, like is what made the show good.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  It would not have lasted as long
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  if it had been just another show.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Harvey Peacar, I haven't thought about him
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  in maybe 20 years.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  So Charles Grodon, it was a bit like Jeff.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  Whenever Charles Grodon was on Carson or Letterin,
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  you got that it was kind of a bit.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  But Harvey Peacar genuinely seemed to hate Dave
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  and hate the idea of being on the show at all.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Right.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  And it was just a miserable person.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  Quite frankly, it was not very attractive either.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  So it wasn't really like, you know,
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  people like looking at him.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  And so I think any normal talk show would be like,
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  I don't know who booked him, but they're fired
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  and make sure we never have him back again.
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  Whereas the Letterin people are like,
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  let's have this guy back on every couple months.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  And it was true for, I mean, I think Jeff Altman
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  is, you know, one of his great repeat guests.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  I mean, he would, he loved having Jeff Altman on,
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  partly because I think, you know, I have to tell you
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  if you don't already know about this.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  I'm cribbing some of this from a podcast.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  Have you heard the podcast, the Carson podcast?
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  No.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  Oh, you should know about this.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  There's a show this guy in LA does, this comedian in LA.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  I think it's called the Carson podcast.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  And the whole podcast is him interviewing people
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  who have some kind of an interesting relationship
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  with the Carson show.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  So yeah, it was great.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  So people like Jeff Altman, people like, you know,
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  Bob Einstein, you know, Super Dave.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  Yeah.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.000]  Like just all kinds of people.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  And then, and then like George Carlin's daughter was on.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  But it's, it's a great insight into what you
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  and I know, which is like what an inscrutable person
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  he was.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  Everybody says the same thing.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  It was great.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  It was the greatest honor you ever have.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  But nobody is like two or three people
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  who ever felt like they legitimately knew Johnny Carson.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Yeah.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  Did you read the biography?
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  No, I saw that we talked about that.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  I think one time we talked about that PBS show.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  Oh, that was great.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  The PBS Masters episode.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  That was terrific.
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  Yeah.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  That was the best thing.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  And they didn't really try to get to the person.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  You know, I mean, they acknowledged it.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  And they talked to so many, so many people.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  It was such a great thing, the PBS Masters thing.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  But it was kind of like, almost like Citizen Kane
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  where everybody like knew of, you know, had the same regard
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  for this person, but never really felt like they knew
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  that they made him tick.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  You know?
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  So anyway, you might want to check out that podcast.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  It's pretty good.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  The book, I forget this, Lord.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  Henry, something.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.000]  Yeah.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  Let me look it up here.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  Carson biography.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  Carson bio.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  Henry.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  Let's see.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  Sounds like he'd wrap the show.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Henry Borschkin.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  Henry Borschkin.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  OK, there we go.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.000]  And it's good.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  So he would never talk before the show.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  There would be just a little bit, right?
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  And he would not talk to the guests.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  I mean, he would get in the car and drive away.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Yeah.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  The Henry Borschkin book is uncomfortable to me
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  because clearly it's a betrayal of trust.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Like, there's no way he should be telling his story.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  I mean, it's unauthorized.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  Oh, yeah.
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  Definitely.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  I mean, how could it be authorized?
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  I mean, Carson's dead.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  But I mean, I don't think his family would have wanted it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  And I think if you would ask Johnny while he was alive,
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  would you like Henry Borschkin to write a book about?
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Oh, certainly not.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  Right.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  But on the other hand, he did write it.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  So I read it.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  But I kind of felt, I did.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  I felt a little icky the whole time.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  But there's some crazy stories in there.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  There's one story where I forget if it was his wife
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  or it was just a girlfriend.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  But I think it might have been his wife.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  And he, Johnny thought is one of his, you know, earlier wives.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  This is when the show was still in New York and he lived in New York.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  He figured out his wife was running around on him.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And he wanted to break into the apartment.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  It was her apartment.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  But he was paying for it.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  So he said it's got to be, I'm paying for it.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  So it's legal.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  We're breaking in.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  And he got Henry Bush, he took his lawyer with him.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  And like two guys who could only really be described as toughs.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Thugs.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Yeah.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  And like Henry Bushkin says in the book that the one guy
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  even had a gun tucked in his belt.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  And they go over there and like break into the place
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  and find, you know, find evidence that she was running around on him.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  Oh, God.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  But you know, it's like stories that, you know,
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  you don't expect your lawyer to write a book about that.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  That's why you take your lawyer.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Wait, wait, it's his lawyer that wrote the book?
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Yeah, it's his lawyer.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Oh, my God.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  That's, that's not cricket, man.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  No, it's a good read.
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  It's a good, good read.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  But it's requesting for the library right now.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Yeah, this is a guy, you know, who needed some money, I think.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  Sure.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  But it was, you know, but he, but I guess the thing I,
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  it made me think about it is that he was obviously,
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  he was more than just his lawyer though.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  He became as close a friend as anybody could to him.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  They played tennis together.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  They were both tennis nuts.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  And they used to travel to, I remember that Johnny did this,
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  because I remember I used to watch tennis on TV sometimes,
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  but Johnny would always like for years had an annual trip
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  where he would go to Wimbledon and Henry Bushkin and his wife
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  went with him.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  It was like Johnny and his wife and Henry Bushkin and his wife
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  every year for like 15 years.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  They went to England for like two or three weeks.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  So I mean, they were definitely close,
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  but even then, even being that close that you vacationed
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  with Johnny Carson for a couple of weeks every year.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's like he still clearly didn't really know him that well.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Yeah, totally.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  I think Pat McCormick, the comic, Pat McCormick, who I think
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  had worked on the show and was on a lot.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  Also was another one, but even in interviews,
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  I think Pat McCormick, I think was on that podcast.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  But it's a lot like when you hear people talk about Sinatra,
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  you know, where they're all talking about Mr. Sinatra
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  and like this deference, like he'll come back from the grave
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  and get you whacked.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  Like there's still a lot of deference to Johnny.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  And it's a desire to keep his legacy, you know,
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  clean to the extent possible.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Yeah, I almost feel, I mean, you know,
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  not having ever seen the guy in person.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  But my impression is maybe that like he just was like a one in a
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  1 in a billion freak where the real Johnny Carson was the one
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  who was on for 60 minutes in front of a camera sitting at a desk.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Like that really was him.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  And that it was the other 23 hours of his life where there was,
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  if it's just nothing.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  Oh, yeah. I mean, he's like, he's like a comic book character.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  I mean, you know, where it's almost like Bruce Wayne is the secret.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  You know what I mean?
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  It's like Batman is the real guy in some ways.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Right. And I feel like that might have been Johnny Carson.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  And I feel like, you know, that's what made him so inscrutable
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  and off, you know, off camera.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  Yeah.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Let's take a break.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  I'll take a break.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  And I'm going to tell you about sponsor.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  I'm very excited about the sponsor.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  I think I mentioned it the last time need sponsored,
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  but this is a new company.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  It's a sibling to our good friends at need called foremost.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  Foremost is a small batch American made clothing line for men and women.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  Each month, foremost designs and produces limited collections of men
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  and women's clothing, roughly four or five items per gender each month.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  Alongside an interview series with some of the world's most inspiring creators.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  Most importantly, the average price of foremost products is under 50 bucks.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  So, you know, shirt, pair of pants, something you want to get from average price under 50 bucks.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  Foremost launched today.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  I think today's the official launched February 11th.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  And their first collection is comprised of one full outfit per gender.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  Their inaugural interviewees include Amber Venn's box,
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  a remarkable young executive supporting thousands of independent writers around the world,
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  and Austin Mann.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  No relation, I presume?
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  No, not that I'm aware.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  Founder of Weld and Gentlemen behind a great deal of Apple's photography.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  Mr. Mann currently has work featured in every single Apple store in the world right now.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  So they have a special deal.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  It's totally worth checking out.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  Really cool stuff. Very affordable prices.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  American made.

[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  It's a great website.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  It's really, really cool.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  I'm really proud of that guy.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  And Envious, and I kind of hate him a little bit.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  Our friend Matt Alexander.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  But what he's doing is amazing.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  Like what he's done in such a short period of time.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  I think he's about 14 years old.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  And he's half-English.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  So he's gotten past that.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  And it's still astonishing to me like what that guy has managed to do.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  That when he first described these projects to me,
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  and it just seems like there's more and more coming out all the time.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  You know, I was like, no, that's kind of cool.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  That kind of sounds like a store, like a small store.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  But it's been a big hit.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  It's really frustrating.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  Yeah.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  What you wish you could do something like that?
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  I do.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  I do.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  Because I feel like I don't know.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  I like it because it's real.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  I feel the things that impressed me is people come up with new ideas
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  for businesses and you know.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  Right.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  I like the ones that have something that you can touch.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  Where you got to buy a, by film for your virtual camera.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  No.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  No.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  I don't know.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  I think it drives you nuts, though.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  Right?
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Like that's not really, that's not really a company.
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  I would say that the spectrum of the things that I tend to be most interested in are on the one side
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  are real physical things.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  Like somebody who's making iPhone docs out of blocks of wood.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  Right.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  I mean, not all of them.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  I don't like them all.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  But I mean, you know, something like that.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  Where you're making a real thing and you're doing it real way.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  And then the ones I like least would have to be the virtual fake real world constraints.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  You know, the...
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.000]  Some of the kinds of services that are out there are so weird.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  As I get more and more cynical about everything,
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  and a little bit more frisky about things like privacy.
[29:58.000 --> 30:00.000]  You just see stuff coming down the lane.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  You're like, really?
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  That's...
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  There's this thing.
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  You remember every block?
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  Did you get that?
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Sure.
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.000]  Steven Johnson.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  And Wilson...
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  I think Wilson Minor worked on that, but it was a really amazing service.
[30:11.000 --> 30:17.000]  Super clean, beautiful website that would basically aggregate all kinds of mostly public information
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  about things like police activity, safety.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  I mean, anything that you couldn't care less for any neighborhood except your own.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  But in your neighborhood, you really care.
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  And it's incredible.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  I went in and I saw one time I called the cops about something and I could find that on the website.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  It was really, really cool.
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  But I think they contracted to be an only a few contract that has been kind of sucked down to be just in a few cities.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Now, these other ones cropping up my wife got me to get on this one in our neighborhood.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  It's just...
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  It's so annoying.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's one of those things where you sign up and you gotta like give them tons of information.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  They want your phone number.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  They want to send a postcard to your house to verify that you're fine.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  And then they automatically put your address on the website and then every page you're on.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  There are call to actions and pop-ups telling you to go invite more people.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  It asks you to, like, you know, bring in all of your...
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  On the one hand, they're real careful about making sure who you are.
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  But then it's one of those, remember like path kind of thing where they're like,
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.000]  now don't you want to...
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  And bring in all of your contacts and your Facebook people?
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  And it's like, I am increasingly super uncomfortable with that as a business model.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  It's gross.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  As soon as they ask me for it, I had to close the window.
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  I immediately think, well, that's your business model and then I'm grossed out.
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, there's some kinds of things, like say what you will about Google.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  I mean, like opening that Google app, especially like when I'm out of town.
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.000]  I was out of town last week.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  It still kind of blows my mind to how smart Google is.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  I know they're Google.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  But like, if there's anybody out there who is providing some value for the nonsense they do,
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  you gotta give them credit.
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  Like, here's what you're traveling to.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  There's the temperature.
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  Hey, here's your flight that just came in via this via email.
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  Like, that kind of stuff, you know, I wish they were better with the privacy stuff in some ways.
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  But that's a real value.
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  They've done something very innovative to be able to do that at scale.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  But you can just feel on some of these websites where you just tell that they're young.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  It's a new company.
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  And it's all about building the user base.
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  And then leveraging as much personal information as possible.
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.000]  I don't know.
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  It's kind of a boring thing to get into.
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  But I find that I find that really kind of gross and frustrating.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  I feel like enough of my stuff is out there.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  I don't need to go sign up for free services that are going to do that.
[32:20.000 --> 32:34.000]  Did you see there was an article I forget the guy's name a couple of weeks ago on Google.
[32:34.000 --> 32:42.000]  The trade-off between, if you give Google everything they want to know about you and buy into their stuff,
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  you get a tremendous experience out of it.
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.000]  Like, if you've got an Android phone and you use the whole ecosystem and the apps, that kind of thing.
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  Right.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  And like you said, and it definitely works.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  I mean, I don't buy into this.
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  It certainly come a long way.
[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  Right.
[33:02.000 --> 33:09.000]  But it's cool stuff like if you're using Gmail and you let, you know, then you get your flight stuff into your Gmail.
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  And then they already know you have a flight because they've already parsed the email from your airline that says you're doing it.
[33:15.000 --> 33:21.000]  And then your today view already has, like you said, has the weather for San Francisco because that's where I'm flying.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.000]  Right.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  Or like I just got a pop up yesterday.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's like this shirt that you ordered for, a short order for my kid.
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  They're like, it just shipped.
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  Here's a FedEx number.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  Like that's actually pretty useful.
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
[33:33.000 --> 33:41.000]  So I mean, but it's, it's like you said though, like, I'm, you know, a little wary of it.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  But at least with Google, the exchange is very clear.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  It's okay, you're going to give up some of your privacy and they're going to, they're going to send you targeted ads.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  And that makes me a little uncomfortable.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  But in exchange, there's, there's a very clear value proposition though.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  It's, you know, we know, we're going to give you stuff that you need to know, like your weather and reminders of things that you didn't even
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  ask to be reminded of, but that you would need to.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  And I think that's pretty interesting.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Whereas with a lot of these startups, it's like,
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  they want the information and you know, they're going to sell it out.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  And it's like, I have no idea, you know, why would I, why would I give this to you?
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  Right, right, right, right.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  And yeah, anyway, it's, it's probably kind of a thistle to get into it.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  But you know, then you look at something like Uber, where did you see the thing where they,
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  they're lost and found database was like an unprotected spreadsheet on the internet with people's names and phone numbers in it?
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  No, I did not.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  It's like, wow, that's, that's pretty rough.
[34:38.000 --> 34:43.000]  So the sharing economy thing is, is super interesting to me because I, I,
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  I'm kind of surprised really, especially in San Francisco, I am very surprised this stuff has gotten as far as it has.
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.000]  You know, you asked me 10 years ago, I mean, I live in a neighborhood where it's very difficult to get the cab any time.
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  And I've cursed the cab companies forever because they don't give a fig.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  They don't need to.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  They can just drive, you know, up and down Polk Street and make all the money in the world, drive to the airport.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  There's, you know, you know what I mean?
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  That's how it works in a city.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  But I never would have guessed that they would get away with that here.
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  You know what I mean?
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's such a strong kind of union town in some ways.
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  It's such a strong town for like people who are protected, you know, interest, like with the medallions and stuff.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  Kind of amazed that stuff has gotten as far as it has.
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  I am too.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  I didn't know.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  I didn't realize that.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  I don't know if you saw my tweet.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  I don't know, a week or two ago.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  There was an article like, like lift start just started here in Philly.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  And the article about lift was about how the whole thing like all the Uber, all the
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  Uber's in Philly are illegal.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  There's, they're not supposed to be operating in Philly.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  Well, it's like news to me.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  I've been using Uber in Philly for like two years.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  I had no idea.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  That's, that's, isn't that kind of mind blowing?
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  It just seems like like one low level government functioner.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  I could walk into that office to shut off the lights.
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  But like, so they, I mean, black cars are obviously legal, but not based on, you know, not through the Uber.
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  But they're regulated.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  I mean, I guess.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  I don't know what it is, but there's something like, and we have Uber X now too.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  So we have the, you know, amateur cab driver version.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  You meet some very interesting people with Uber X.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  And the whole thing was about how lift, you know, lift's got the, the pink mustaches on the cars, which makes them so easy to identify.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  So they're like, because they're illegal, like the, but it's not enforced by the police.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  It's enforced by the parking authority.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  The long arm of the parking authority.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  Right.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  But I've heard stories.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  I don't know if these are true, but I've heard anecdotes where people are like,
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  okay, fist bump, get in.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Now, put your, put your bag on the trunk.
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  We're friends.
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  We've known each other since college.
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  Like we're, you know, because the lift experience is still a little, a little, on the bubble.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Yeah, I'm not comfortable with it really.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  Yeah.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  Yeah.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  Yeah.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  I'm not either.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  But, you know, out here, there's an article in the paper,
[36:53.000 --> 37:03.000]  which a week or two ago about how, I mean, I find this totally plausible, Uber drivers are making like something like on average $10 an hour more than taxi drivers.
[37:03.000 --> 37:11.000]  There's been a utter diaspora of people leaving these taxi companies to go work for Uber because it's just a smart deal in it.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  Yeah.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  I've done that.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  And when I first started using Uber, it was in San Francisco because, you know, it was early days when Uber was new.
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  And I don't know where that, I don't know, maybe that was the only place where they were operating at first.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  I remember thinking, well, this sounds weird.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Right.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  This sounds weird.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  But I'll try it.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  And I remember like, first couple of times I got in the Uber, I would be asked the driver.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  I was like, so how do you like this?
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  Do you like this?
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  And two have never, never was the answer.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  Anything other than I love it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  This is, you know, this is great.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  And whereas if I get a cab ride, I've said this story elsewhere.
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  But every last month, I got a cab ride home from a gig.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  And the entire time, the guy had his right arm on the seat,
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  turning around, facing me, the entire trip, screaming.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  He's like an Uber, anti-uber activist.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Like the entire ride.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  Like I'm, you know, three sheets to the wind and just trying to put my headphones on and on.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  And he really wasn't talking about Uber.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  And it's, it's, that's the battle lines have been drawn.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  I tried using that app.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  But, you know, curb, do you have that there?
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  No, I don't think we do.
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  There's an app, at least in San Francisco, that is the go-to app for ordering a cab in an Uber-like way.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  I've tried it three times and waiting 10 minutes.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  I've never even gotten a response that a cab would even be available.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  But just because I live out in kind of a crazy part of town.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  So I mean, it's, it's, I don't love using it either.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  And they kind of seem like dicks.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  I mean, no offense to do, but there's some pretty crazy decisions going on.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  Yeah, I'll send you a link.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  Here's what we've got.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  Okay.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  This is our new thing is two, one, five, get a cab.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  Okay.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  It's, it's clearly like, like the,
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  the various cab companies have colluded together.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  I mean, I'm not colluded in an illegal way, but it's got to point it.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's in response to Uber.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  It's just no doubt about it.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  It is, it is in response to Uber.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  And they've got it plastered all over all of their,
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  Oh, that.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  All of the vehicles two or five.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  Remember that time?
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  And so I feel like the thing that's funny to me though,
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  is they want you to get the app, right?
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Yep.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Get the app.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  Have the app, have the app before it occurs to you that you need a cab.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  Right.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Because you're drunk in, in an alley somewhere, like what are you going to do?
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Download an app, like you need to have it on your phone.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  All right.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  And it's a new thing, but they've come up with the name is a phone number.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Like it's still the 80s and you've got to go over, you know,
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  does anybody have a quarter?
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  Give me a quarter.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  I got a call to get a cab.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  Right.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  You know, you can just imagine the meeting with like, all right,
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  we'll do the, we'll do the app, but it's got to be the phone number.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Right.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  And so their, their, their website is two, one, five,
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  get a cab.com.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  For some reason, I'm reminded of, I want to see like in the early 2000s,
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  when, you know, the dot coms have already started the dot com like retail.com's
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  the pest.com and all those clearly, like things were a little rocky,
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  but there were more and more places that wanted to look like an e-business.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  And I think a lot of them were basically just like a CGI or a pearl script
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  that sent something to a fax machine.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  You go in and you fill out a form.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  You do not have any sense that anything electronic was happening at all.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  You know what I mean?
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  Not like today where you can like track things and stuff like that.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  I think it used to be pretty root goldberg to start a company like that.
[40:20.000 --> 40:20.000]  Right.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  Yeah.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  I like the idea that I think it was probably what's true that a lot of places
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  where you could order online, it would generate a fax or.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  Oh, that's how it works now.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  If you order a lot of food online, all it does is print something out.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  I mean, obviously that's, that's the installed base.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  You know, it just, it just prints something out next to the cash register.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  I don't know, man.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  Yeah.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  Should we talk about vaccines?
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  Oh, come on.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Oh, man.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  Ah.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Well, if we talk, if we end up, I was telling a friend of mine,
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  what our nominal topic for today was, which I'm very excited about.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  And my friend responded, I say, you were going to get so much email.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  So we might as well jam an all into one episode.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  So that's a lot of vaccines.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  So the thing that got me about the vaccines with it being back in the news again is,
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  is like, it's everywhere now.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  Right.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's all, it's percolated up to like the national consciousness.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  And it's on the news every day now and also.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  And I was like, why all of a sudden, I mean, this is not a new thing.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  I mean, this is a thing.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  It's only a story if there's a controversy, right?
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  That's the thing.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  I couldn't just go.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  These people are dumbasses.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  I would have to say, well, there's still a couple of scientists that haven't definitely
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  decided on this.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  It's, and I realized it's obvious.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's all because actual people got actual measles at Disneyland.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  And I didn't really put, I saw that story and I thought, well, of course they are
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  dead because there's a bunch of dope who aren't getting it.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  There's so many people who aren't getting their kids.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  I mean, I said, of course there's an outbreak.
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  I wasn't, I was so unsurprised that there was an outbreak of measles at Disneyland.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  That it seems like a perfect place for there to be a measles outbreak given the conditions.
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.000]  I couldn't believe that it was news, you know, whereas it clearly is like the eye opener
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  for a lot of people.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  Like, oh my God, you know, if you don't get your kid into it.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  It just seems like that's a big part of the conversation is holy shit.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  If millions of people don't immunize their kids, these kids could get measles.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  Like that seems to be our national conversation.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Yeah, it's really frustrating.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  It's, yeah.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  I don't know what to say.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  So I saw an interesting poll on, by age, whether you support mandatory immunization.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  And it drops off so precipitously.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  It's like 70 year olds.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It's like almost universal support.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  60 year olds, very high, 50, 40 kind of high.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  And once you get in your 40s and 30s, it's lower.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  And then you talk to kids in their 20s.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  And it's like, you know, it's like 15% support mandatory.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  That doesn't mean that they don't think people should do it.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  They're just saying it shouldn't be mandatory.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  But I think that the reason that it's eight.
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  It's like, it's like reading to your kid.
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  That's what I was saying.
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  It's a good idea.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  But yeah, I don't really technically have to do that.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  That's the idea.
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  Like, yeah, I don't have to do that.
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  I don't have to give my kid a measles shot.
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  Well, the reason it's eight specific though is so obvious.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's because older people remember what it's like when your neighbor had polio.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  Right?
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  Are there many parents age who made it through the depression
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  and watched a neighbor on one side of them lose three kids.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  Or a sibling even, right?
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  My grandmother lost a sibling to it flew in the,
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  I think, you know, right around World War I.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Right.
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  So they've saw it.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  And then all of a sudden, scientists come out with just a shot
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  that makes your arms sore for a day.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  And then you'll never get polio.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  Of course, they support it.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  Uh, yeah, I don't know.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  I'm trying so hard to grow as a person, John.
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  I'm trying really hard to be sympathetic
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  and understand everybody's position, but it's one of the things
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  that I think we talked years ago about the thing.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  Remember the, you told me this.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  Remember that there was that poll that something was,
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  what was the percentage of people who were thoroughly convinced
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  that Obama is not eligible to be president?
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  Oh, I see.
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  Even late, late late in that, in that rumor.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  It was still like 40% or something ridiculous of people.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  And it's like there's, the thing is there's, you know,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  there's, there's, there's a, I've been reading this book
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  that I'll apparently mention on every podcast called,
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  The Wisdom of Insecurity by Owen Watts.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  And he makes a distinction in that book that really,
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  it really hit me.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  He makes a distinction between faith and belief,
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  which I found very persuasive.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  With the idea that, you know, faith is a thing that we all have.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  Yeah, there are sight unseen things that we,
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  there's some part of us that has faith that these kinds of things
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  could happen that there might be a heaven or whatever,
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  which is really different from belief.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  Because belief is a kind of a more dangerous thing.
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  Because belief is where, you know,
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  there's not really that much to even discuss.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  Like I've decided that this is how things are.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  And nothing is going to talk me out of this,
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  because now it's become part of who I am.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Now I am a person who believes this about vaccines,
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  or believes this about Obama.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  And, you know, I think that can become very internalized.
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  You and I probably have things like that.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  There's not even aware of.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  But, you know, that's the dangerous part.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  And there's no, what, what, what we dumb liberals don't understand,
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  is there's no way there are never going to be enough infographics,
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  then diagrams, or horrifying maps,
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  to convince people of anything different.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  I mean, Jesus Christ, we had George W. Bush
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  in the White House for eight years.
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  People will believe anything.
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Well, one of the things that's interesting about the,
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  I think the whole immunization thing is very sad.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  And for anybody who's listening,
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  I do have enough listeners.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  I'm sure that there's got to be some of you who.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  You should stick to computers.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  Yeah, stick to computers who have children.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  You've chosen not to immunize.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  I do, I think one of the things that's,
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  I want to, I want to be a big person.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  I want to be, as, I don't want to be insulting.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  But, I think one of the things that's fascinating about it
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  is that it has no traditional political divide.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's not a liberal thing or a Republican thing
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  or a conservative thing or a rural thing.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  It's like all over the map.
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  It's, you know, it's like when they pull,
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  I saw one poll that was like exactly 50-50,
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  where like, they talked to, I don't know.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  However, poll sample size number of parents
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  who chose not to immunize their children.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  And who did you vote for in the last election
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  and it was like 50-50 split.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  Really? Yeah.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  Do you think the reasons why they differ are different?
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  Would they agree on the reason why they decide not to do that?
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  I, you know, I don't know.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  But I remember one of the big reasons that it really caught on
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  was I remember reading the article.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  It was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  wrote like a feature magazine-length article.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  I don't know if it was for the Atlantic
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  or one of those magazines like that.
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  You know, back when there was that one ingredient
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  in the, you know, that they were-
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  Yeah.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  They thought-
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  We worried about that.
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  I'll be honest with you.
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  Well, Jonas was around that age.
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  I mean, it was at the height of it.
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  It was, I think when Jonas was, he just turned 11.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  So I think when Jonas was getting that's like,
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.000]  his first year immunizations was,
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.000]  I think it was before that one paper in Britain
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  had been debunked.
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.000]  Oh, the Lancet article.
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  Right.
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  I think it was before it was debunked.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  So it was definitely, you know, it was a thing.
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  I don't know.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  We were little, you know, I didn't really put creams into it,
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  but I, you know, I was, it was,
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  I just remember it being that thing.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  We talked about it.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  Mm-hmm.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  We asked, we asked a lot of questions for sure.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  And they, you know, they were very sober about it
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  and actually, you know, like oddly patient,
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  like you have to be with a new parent.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Because, you know, we pretty much knew we were just going to have
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  the one kid.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  It's like we don't get a lot of shots at this.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  So speak.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  And we, it was important to us to know that kind of stuff.
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  I don't feel dumb for asking those questions
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  because they were very, they were,
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  the doctor was very straightforward about it.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  It's the same thing that, hmm,
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  a lot of sensible people understand,
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  which is like there's risks to everything in life.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  But what we can tell you is the risks associated
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  with vaccination are nothing compared
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  with the very demonstrable risks of not vaccinating.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  Yeah.
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.000]  As an individual, I think.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  In terms of risk analysis or cost benefit,
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  it's not even, it's not even a comparison.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  Right.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  And then I, you know, especially when it comes to your kid,
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  I think it's, it's almost human instinct,
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  at least in our modern world,
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  where, where we're very, as parents,
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  we're very selfish about our children,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  that we want, we'll do anything for our kids.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  And, you know, if you could prove
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  that your kid might be better off without,
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  as an individual would be better off without immunizations
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  versus the whole civic responsibility,
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  the herd, you know, the herd, the herd advantage
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  of getting everybody immunized,
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  I can see it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  And I think that's the basic thinking that's going on
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  behind the people who chose not to immunize their children,
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  that they value, you know, that they believe
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  some kind of bad thing can happen from the immunizations.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  Right.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  And regardless of what it means for her.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  But that's a sticky idea.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  That's a very durable idea, whether or not it's true or accurate.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  I can certainly understand why it's something that,
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  I mean, I don't agree with it, but I get why that's something
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  that people feel is a big risk.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  Right.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  You know, but think about this.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  I mean, this is something where I think we all have,
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  I feel like I have a lot in common with other people,
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  which is, you know, I have grown so,
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  I'm skeptical, so cynical about all the turns out
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  announcements about what's dangerous.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  And, you know, there's been numerous, you know,
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  articles over the years talking about the crazy history of stuff
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  like the food pyramid.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  Right.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  The USDA's food pyramid.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  You're not USDA.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Is that what it is?
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  What's the one that puts out the food pyramid like in the 70s?
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  We'd like, make sure you have tons and tons of bread.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  And, you know what I mean?
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  And then it was so USDA.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  But it was very much, apparently very much formed
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  by these different industries.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  Not to be like a nut or something.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  But your body was never meant to handle this much corn.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  My God.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  No one's supposed to jam this much corn into their hole.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's nuts.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  And then what happens?
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  And we go, well, that's the enemy.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  Okay, so, quitting eggs.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  All right.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  So, now, that's the enemy.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  So, let's have snack wells.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  So, everyone sits around and eats fat-free brownies with
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  three cups of sugar in it.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  Oh, wait a minute.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  No, it turns out sugar is actually the enemy and so forth.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Look, no further back than in the last decade.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Look at fucking water bottles.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  Do you follow this at all?
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  No.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  Like, what used to be, you're like, oh, you're killing the
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  environment with all of these cups.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  So, for God's sake, go out and buy a nudging bottle.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  And you had to have a nudging bottle.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  Where's your nudging bottle?
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  Those stupid plastic bottles.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Oh, no, guess what?
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  Turns out, phthalates.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  Oh, my gosh, you're going to die because you're doing the right
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  thing.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  So, now you should go and buy this kind of, and now people are saying
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  maybe there's aluminum ones that we used to replace the
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  nudging bottles you're about.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  You know, and the trouble is it doesn't, it kind of doesn't
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  matter what is actually true, accurate, accurate, or known.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  What matters is we are scared to hurt ourselves and our kids
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and we're always going to try and have the most recent
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  information that we can find about what we should do about it.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  I mean, you're not even supposed to put plastic in the microwave
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  anymore.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  Like, what do you put in the microwave?
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  You know, like, throw the goddamn thing out if you can't
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  put plastic in it.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  It's useless.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  Who does?
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  I'm not going to make a bowl to warm something up.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  I'm not a fucking monster.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  I remember coaching Little League a couple of years ago.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  I am familiar with the whole water bottle thing now.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  And I had something to do with...
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  I think it was phthalates.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  I don't know.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  I know, baby bottles and phthalates.
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  It's like, it made me feel like time traveling dad from the
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  1950s.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  You know, like, I'm just trying to make sure none of these kids
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  get hit in the mouth with a baseball.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  Right?
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  Number one, I don't want anybody getting to hit in the head
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  with a baseball.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  It's a constant fear.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  You've got 12 kids.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  And at some point, at least two of the 12 invariably are not
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  paying attention to the game.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  And therefore, at risk of getting hit in the head with a baseball,
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  which is bad.
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  So it's...
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  We can all agree on that.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  Every game is two hours of nonstop.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  Ninety-five percent of my attention is don't let any of these kids
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  get hit by a baseball.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  And then five percent of my attention is let's, you know,
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  try to score some runs and get some outs and maybe win the game.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  And in the meantime, there's this whole thing with all the other...
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Not just moms, either.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  It's moms and dads and they're all talking about like,
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  oh, you got to get rid of that bottle.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  That bottle that you can't drink out of that.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  Everybody's an expert.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  And I'm just like, just give the kids some damn water.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  I don't know.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.000]  When I was a kid, we just...
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  We just had...
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.000]  We just had a lot of machines game with like 50 of those little
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  comic book boxes.
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  Oh, sure.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  The paper like the water cups.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  Yeah.
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  The conical paper cups.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  You just leave them on the field.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  Put the Indian clean them up.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  Exactly.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  You didn't even have to clean them up.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  Yeah, totally.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  Totally.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  And I mean, you know, it is funny given like how you and I already
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  come from kind of a paper generation.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  It's so many ways.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  We're probably the last generation that has a chance of doing
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  better than our parents in life.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  Um, for a while anyway.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  But you know, I mentioned this a lot.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  But like some of my...
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  I'm not...
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Okay, guys, I'm not advocating for this.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  But I have such...
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  I wrote a thing about this one time.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  Just having this memory of our old green Pontiac, my dad
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  driving around smoking a butt with the windows down.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  It means like standing on the seat.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  Like, or you can just stick your head out the window.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  You just do all this crazy stuff.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Seat belts you've got to be kidding me.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  Do we even have seat belts?
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  You know, and now today my daughter doesn't do anything
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  without a helmet.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  I mean, that's...
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  Like, I want to protect our head.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  But it is...
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.000]  It is pretty...
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  It is pretty wild how many people manage to survive that.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Now, at the same time,
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  I was trying to explain to the best of my amateur ability
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  how the world population is and how it works.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  I was saying to my kid, like, okay, I think there's like
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  what, coming up on 7 billion people, something like that.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  I was like, can you guess why that keeps going up?
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  And my hints were, well, you know, one of them is,
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  when mommy and daddy's get together, what happens?
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  Well, they have babies.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  I'm like, yeah, and when those babies grow up
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  and they become mommy's and daddy's, what happens?
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  And they have like three kids.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  And I was just like, oh, I said more kids.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  And I was like, but the other thing is, like,
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  then to our credit, I think people die
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  of less completely preventable random shit
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  than when I was a kid.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  I've got to stipulate.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Thank God for seat belts.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  They've made the road safe for the cars or safer.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  It's all safer.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Everybody knew somebody that had died in a car accident
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.000]  when I was a kid.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  It was just a thing.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  It was the cancer and car accidents killed and lung disease.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  Like, killed everybody when I was a kid.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  And they're all at least partially preventable.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  All right.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  A huge swath of car accidents are preventable.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  Well, in addition to seat belts, there's the whole,
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  maybe you've seen the footage you had to.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  The difference in the crumple zones of like an old car
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  and a new car.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  It's almost forcicle.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Yeah.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  Oh, man.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  This driver's head movies.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  I still think about him.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  I've never unbuckled a dead man.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  My mom took our Pontiac to, I don't think they should
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  take the dealership.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  She took a due mechanic and said, look, we bought this $8,000 car
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  and it beeps when we sit in it.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  If we don't put on the seat belts, can you turn that off?
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  And he said, yes.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  I will turn that off for you.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  All right.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  I, or you just leave it, you leave it like,
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  fastened all the time.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  My sister and I were not allowed to use the seat belts
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  because we would mess them up.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  Like, you know what I mean?
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  You know what I mean?
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  Like, they wouldn't retract right anymore
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  or you know, you get them twisted around.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  You used to be pretty basic the way that it would retract.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Yeah.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  You could like get it off the runner, like off the spool
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  and it wouldn't go back in, right?
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  All right.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  So at some point, one of us had gotten one of the ones
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  in the back seat twisted in the, you know,
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  the actual belt was twisted in the, what would you call it?
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  That little cartridge kind of thing.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  Yeah.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  The cartridge that would slide to make a disaster.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  Exactly what you mean.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  They were really primitive.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  They didn't snap into place very well and it was very
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  easy when feeding it back.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  It would be like a, like a, like a, like a roller blind
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  getting slightly off track at the beginning of the mean
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  way off track by the, to the end.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  Yeah.
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  It's a lot.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  The only thing that someone or to it anymore are airplane
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  seat belts, but it was a lot, the buckling connection
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  was a lot more primitive.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  Yeah.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  But the way that you could slide it on the belt,
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  well, we'd gotten it twisted up and it took my mom a long time
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  to fix it.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  And so from then on, we weren't allowed to use seat belts.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Just let them go.
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.000]  It took her 15 minutes to get them untangled.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  So then that was it.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  No more seat belts.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  What do you, what do you think's going to happen with the
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  vaccine stuff?
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Do you think it'll take a generation?
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Or does it take event generation or does it take a measles
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  911?
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  Like what, what do you think will change and how in the
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  next however many end years?
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  I've been thinking about, I don't think, I don't
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  think there's any way to go back on it.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  And, you know, part of it is what we were saying a couple
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  of months ago where you can't come out of them.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Like they've done studies that you go at them with the
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  most factual statistical approach of this relative safety
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  of immunizations and the fact that, you know, how
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  horrible it is.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  You know, measles can make you blind.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  Killed people.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  I think they said, I'm just 46 people a day,
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  die from measles around the world.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  What?
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Something like that around the world.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  And you give them these facts and the people who don't
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  want to vaccinate their kids, get the facts and they come
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  out of it more convinced.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  I heard this.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  I did hear that.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  But, you know, facts are slippery things.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  And I mean, if somebody that you didn't trust, let's be
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  honest, if somebody you didn't trust that you considered to
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  be a mouthpiece for an organization, some kind of like,
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  like the Laramie cigarettes guys on the Simpsons, if
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  somebody came to you with some information and you knew
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  that they were compromised, even if they gave you what
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  they presented as facts, you wouldn't listen to them.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Or you probably wouldn't go look at the primary
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  research, right?
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  I'm, you know, I'm the same way.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  I know what I believe.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I know what I think is BS.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  It's just that it's right back to that.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  I think we've talked about this every time that
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Lake Off Book don't think of an elephant.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  If you have a certain mental model for how reality
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  works and what relationships are and how you determine
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  what's real and that overrides or supersedes new
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  information, like by order of magnitude, right?
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  I mean, it's gotta.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  I mean, the way that you have conducted yourself
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  in the world for however many n 30 some years, whatever,
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  is likely to have such, I totally buy that, you know,
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  and what your family believes and what the people around
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  you believe, what the people your church believe.
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  It's constantly being reinforced because that's part of your
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  tribe.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  That's what your tribe believes.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  And there's no reason not to.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  I mean, we've all got tribal things like that, right?
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  And you like the stupid, you like the Dallas Cowboys.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  You've got problems of your own.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  That's part of the problem though, is that there is a sort
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.000]  of tribal behavior where the kids who are not immunized
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  tend to be clustered because it spreads and you become friend.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  You know, I mean, we're not like super buddy buddy with
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  any other parents at school, but you talk to them and, you know,
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  and it's like, it becomes like a thing where like now,
[58:39.000 --> 58:42.000]  like I forget what the percentages in Marin County,
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  but it's just ridiculous.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  Marin's got a lot of weird outliers.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  Marin also has a used to have as far as I know, like a
[58:48.000 --> 58:52.000]  probably high rate of breast cancer.
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  And I imagine there's ways to come up with, with why that is
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  that don't involve, you know, high power lines or something.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  It could be that they're getting detection better or something.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  I don't know.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  But yeah, yeah, Marin.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  Yeah, Marin's a thing.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  I remember Scott Simpson said something made me laugh a
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  long time ago when he had a kid and I didn't have the time
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  to have a kid.
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  I think it was a two.
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  He had back in the, in the Favard days.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  And he said something like there's two kinds of parents,
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  like there's the helicopter parents that are, you know,
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  more protective than me and I hate them.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  And then there's the parents who are totally curious
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  with their kids and I hate them too.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Like the way you evaluate everything is based on what you
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  think.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  Everybody else is either too permissive or too strict.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  It's true.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's true.
[59:36.000 --> 59:37.000]  They're just a bunch of assholes.
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.000]  Right.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  All right.
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.000]  That kid's an asshole.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  He doesn't even have the time to choose it.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  And then there's the other kid is, you know,
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.000]  look at that guy.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  What's wrong with these parents?
[59:46.000 --> 59:47.000]  They're maniacs.
[59:47.000 --> 59:48.000]  They're kids of men.
[59:48.000 --> 59:49.000]  She needs to come on kid.
[59:49.000 --> 59:50.000]  It's a juggle gym.
[59:50.000 --> 59:51.000]  Let the kid play.
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.000]  Oh, my God.
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  I can't believe you let him get on the juggle gym.
[59:54.000 --> 59:57.000]  All right.
[59:57.000 --> 59:58.000]  All right.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Or even with what we want to talk about later,
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  like with movies.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Like I cannot believe they let their kid watch that.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Or I can't believe that they don't want us to let him watch
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Harry Potter, you know.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Oh, oh, this is, this is what makes it.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  I texted you about this this morning.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  I know we're not getting into it just now.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  But you know, the way I tried to phrase this to my daughter
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  and we'll come back to this was like, you know,
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  it's not just a matter of like, you know me.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  I like, I like facet.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I like as they say it academics.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  I like problematizing.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  I like taking something that seems obvious
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  and figuring out how it's actually a mess.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And so like with kids in media,
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  it's not just like, what do you show your kids?
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  It's like, hmm.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  It's like, well, what kinds of stuff do you show your
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  particular kid at what point in their life
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  in what context, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Because we all know every kid's really different.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I mean, anybody with two kids,
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  just kind of people who say,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Google's this kind of company.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Apple's this kind of company.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  If you said to them,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  you're three kids are identical.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  They'd hit you in the face.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  You're okay.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Because all their kids are special flowers.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  So I know we'll come back to that,
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  but oh, we're gonna get so much email.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  We're gonna get a lot of email.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Let me take a break.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Let's take a break and thank another one of our sponsors.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Good friends at Harry's.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Now you guys know Harry's.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  They're the people who make top notch men's.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Shaving stuff.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  They've got razors.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  They've got razor handles.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  They've got product.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  You know, like shaving cream, shaving gel,
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  after shave, that kind of stuff.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And the basic just behind their story is that they looked
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  at the market for razors and shaving stuff
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  and saw that it was a mess.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  It's stuff that's ugly.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  It's stuff that's overpriced.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  It's stuff that's a pain and he asked to buy.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  She got to go hit a button and ask somebody to come over with a key
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  to let you please if I could.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Could I please have some razor blades?
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  It's like when you remember when the compact disc stores
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  used a lot, the CDs.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  We know what I love.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I go to my Walgreens seven times a day.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  And when I go there to buy some goddamn razor blades
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  and I am a Harry's user now, to be honest.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  But when I go in there to get like if I'm traveling
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  and I want to bring this particular razor with me,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I go there and it's the same dingus kid that I see
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  seven times a day and I say,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  oh, could I please have the, that's in such, you know,
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  $75 worth of blades please?
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Is it going to root a trick out?
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  No.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I'm like, no, I want to walk around the store
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  and steal stuff for a while.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  No, he's got to walk me.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Right.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  The system manager was to walk me to the counter
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  so that I don't steal his precious Gillette's.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  No.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  I,
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  I,
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I one time I had to,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  I was at your neck or the woods.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  I was in San Francisco for one of these Apple events
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  or something like that.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Oh, I forgot my toothbrush.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  That's the sort of thing I,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I cannot,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  I think not brushing your teeth for two or three days.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Your mouth would feel hard,
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  but you got to take care of it.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  I guess I probably should have just called down the front desk
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  at the hotel and seen if they could do it,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  but I thought, well, I got to go out anyway
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  and I went on right there on Market Street to,
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  I don't know, what is it?
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Is it a, is it a,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  you know, like a CVS or Walgreens?
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Yeah, I forget what they get,
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  what, you know, but I go in there
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  and the goddamn toothbrushes were locked behind us.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  What?
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Yeah, because I guess people steal toothbrushes.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  I ran out of deodorant.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  I went to buy deodorant yesterday.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  All of the deodorant was under lock and key.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  So I got to call some kids to come over
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  and unlock a little deodorant jail
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  to open up for me and then walk me
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  to the counter like an animal.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Right, and they wonder why we're buying all our stuff for me.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Well, anyway, Harry's has this fixed.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  It's great stuff.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  They keep expanding their line.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  They've got new stuff.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  So if you haven't checked them out in a while,
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  go there.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  They have a new line limited edition razors,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  the Jimmy Chin line.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  They're inspired by Jimmy Chin,
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  I've never heard of them before,
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  but he's an explorer and photographer.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  They have some pretty cool photos from them.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  But it's a new limited edition line of razors
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  really, really cool looking.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  They have great stuff.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  They also have.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  They have these subscriptions.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I don't know.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  They call them shave plan.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  You go there and you tell them how often you shave.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Do you shave every day?
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Do you shave once a week?
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Tell them how often you shave.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And then you get a plan
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  that will just have new stuff show up
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  on a regular basis right when you need it.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And you can cancel any time.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  You want to grow a beard.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  You want to stop shaving.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  You want to switch to another brand.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  You can just cancel at any time.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  It's like taunts for razors, really.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  So I mean, for example,
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  I bought coffee once in the last year
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  because there was like one stretch
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  where I'd gotten ahead of my taunts
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  and needed to go buy it.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  I don't buy razors anymore.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  I don't have to buy shaving cream anymore.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  It just shows up on a regular basis from Harry's.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Really great stuff.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And they have a special deal
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  for listeners of the show.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  The code is talkshow,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  And that will save you five bucks
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  on your first order.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  So it's only good for people
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  who are making their first order.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  If you're already a Harry's customer,
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  just go and renew and sign up for a plan.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Sorry.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  But if you're new,
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  you can use the yet, use the code talkshow,
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  know the, and you'll save five bucks.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  And you can get a kit for like 15 bucks,
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  so you can only cost you like 10.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  So for 10 bucks, you can totally upgrade your shave.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  Good people at Harry's.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  Yeah, great service.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  You know what would make a great code, good offer code?
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  What would make a good offer?
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  I will never buy anything from assholes
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  who pay John Gruber for sponsorships.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  That was, that was from our friend Dave over at Matt.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  He was looking through his, his refers,
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  his refers over at mad.com.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  They sponsored a whole slew.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  I love their sponsorships.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Oh my God.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  That was the best sponsors ever.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  I still blows me away with what they did
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  with the Darren Farber sponsorships.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  What's like the four,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  didn't they do like a,
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  was like a 404 page or something?
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  They won to the one,
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  they did like three straight weeks
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  and the one was a,
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  it was a typo.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  They wanted a typo into URLs.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  So it went to a 404 page.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  And so they got one referral.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  It's like a Google analytics screenshot they posted.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Right.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  They had one that was just the title of the link
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  was an ellipse.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  It was just three dots.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  And then it just said,
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  the message that only went in the feed.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  It just said,
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  in this week before Christmas,
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  we thought it'd be nice to take our
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  during fireball sponsorship
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  and not pitch you on anything.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  Enjoy the holidays, Matt.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  And they didn't have a link.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  It didn't,
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  they signed it, Matt,
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  but they didn't link to their website.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  There was no,
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  there was no URL.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  It just went nowhere.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  And then the week before was the one
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  where they had the,
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  the ASCII art of a guy flipping a table.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Right.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Right.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  That set Amazon upside down,
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  like with those crazy
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Unicode characters.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Happy holidays.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Right.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Which only made sense,
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  which was cool because it only made sense
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  if you knew the back story.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  The relationship.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Yeah.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  That they had started Woot.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  This is the same guys who did Woot.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  And they sold the Amazon.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And you ever read that story?
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Like Paul,
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  I think I did.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  It sounds like it was not ideal.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Yeah.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  It was like Amazon bought them.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  And they didn't do well.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  They weren't happy.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  It didn't seem like Amazon cared.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  And the founder had like a breakfast
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  with Jeff Bezos.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Bezos.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Bezos.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Whatever.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  And you know,
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Bezos is going on and on about whatever.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And he's like,
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  well, look, can I ask you a question?
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  He was like, why did you buy Woot?
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  And it was like,
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  he just like stared at his like breakfast.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  And there was like this one weird thing on his,
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  you know, breakfast platter.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Oh, right.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  Like a some weird vegetable.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  He was like,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  your thing was like this,
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  this piece of weird lettuce.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  I didn't understand it.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  So I wanted to buy it.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  I didn't get it.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  So I just wanted to buy it.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  What a psycho.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  It seems like a real nut shop.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  He does.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  He seems,
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  and like the whole story of like the Amazon,
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  the fire phone,
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  it just sounds nuts.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  That was,
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  that was some great reporting.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  I forget if I talked about this on the show
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  or if I just linked it up on Darren Fireball,
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  but Austin Carr wrote that for a fast company.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  And really,
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  really top-notch.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Like if you want to be moan the lack of
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  actual reporting that goes on today,
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  man,
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  that's a great counter example.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Cause he really did the legwork.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  He clearly got people
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  who worked on that phone to talk.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  And Bezos sounds like basically Bezos,
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  like it was his passion project.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  He dove in with both feet.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  And I don't say micromanaged,
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  but he like,
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  he had would not,
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  he would not go off his decisions at any point.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Right?
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Like he was very decisive
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  about exactly how this thing was going to work.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  It wasn't listening to anybody.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  I think long story short,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  well,
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  how did the fire phone come to be?
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  I would say long story short,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  based on Austin Carr's reporting,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  it was something to the effect
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  of we should do a phone.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  If we do a phone,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  it should either be really cheap
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  or it should be asked to,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  if it's not really cheap,
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  then it has to compete with the iPhone.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Oh, and then the 3D,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  it's got to do 3D, right?
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  Well, it would become like a thing.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  That was the thing.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  So then the next step,
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  Bezos was like,
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  well,
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  I want to compete with the iPhone.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Cause I think he wanted to make a phone
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  that he would actually use, right?
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  So like,
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  what's the point of like,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  them making a cheap phone
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  if they themselves are also going to use iPhone?
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  So they wanted to,
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  they're going to go high end.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Then the next step
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  in the logical chain is,
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  well, then we have to have a hook, right?
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  There has to be something.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  If we're going to sell a phone
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  that's like 4,500 bucks,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  there has to be something that is compelling about it.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And Bezos latched onto this 3D thing,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  you know, everybody knows the basic,
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  there's 3D interface that using accelerometers
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and the four cameras on the front,
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  you know, that it can,
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  without any special glasses,
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  it makes like a fake 3D effect
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  on the flat surface of the phone.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And there was like no budging him off that that's,
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  you know, that's like our Siri.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  That's our hook that we can advertise.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Everybody's going to go nuts for it.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And there was apparently a lot of internal skepticism
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  that this would have any actual appeal.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Like, well, what's the point?
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  It's a niche,
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  that just a lot of the people seem to think,
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  well, it is a neat trick,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  but what is the point?
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And then the phone shipped
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  and everybody said,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  well, it's a neat trick,
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  but what's the point?
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  But he stuck with it.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Right.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Well, he printed up a lot of cardboard boxes
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  that said by a fire phone.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  That was so weird.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  The first time I got an Amazon box with that,
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  that on the tape,
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  I was like, what?
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Somebody sent me an Amazon fire phone?
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  I thought the same thing.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  I thought the same thing.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Because every, you know,
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  and I thought it was believable for me
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  because nobody's ever sent me a phone,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  like no company,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  but like I do get some equipment to try.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  You weren't in that sprint program back of the day?
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  No.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  I was in some,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I got the G1 from Google.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  HTC was nice enough to send me that.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  I remember that.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  That was fun.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  But I was in this thing
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  where Sprint would just,
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  they were sending bloggers like new phones
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  every few months,
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  like in the days before.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  I remember it was around the time of the iPhone.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And I finally got this totally crazy looking one
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  where it had screens on both sides
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  and it was kind of meant to look like an iPhone.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  But you would do stuff,
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  you would need to flip the phone around
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  and use different keyboards
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  and a touchscreen was totally crazy.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Well, but it's not outlandish to know
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  that somebody would send me a fire phone.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And that's what I thought it was.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  And it was a box,
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  it was a box that was about the size
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  that a phone might come in.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  I was like,
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I cannot believe somebody sent me a fire phone.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  And I opened it up and it was,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  I don't know, toothpaste.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  So great.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  All right.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Should we do it?
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Well, let's do one more thing
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  and then we'll do it.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Here's the other thing.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  I want to circle back on the vaccination.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Oh, Jesus.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  Well, not the vaccinations in particular,
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  but to me it's a product of the internet age.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  This is why I'm a little pessimistic about it getting fixed
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  because I think pre-internet,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  it just wasn't enough information for people to do that.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Like, you know,
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  your best source of information on the health of your kid
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  was what your pediatrician told you.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  And if your pediatrician said,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  we recommend these immunizations on this schedule.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Well, you know,
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  and maybe you might rely on your family too.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Right. Yeah.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Think about like the things you hear about brand loyalty
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  and how people who are pampers,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  you know, the mom used pampers.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  So they use pampers and we're a Heinz ketchup family
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  and so forth.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Like, you know, I think a lot of people,
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  especially at a young and impressionable age,
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  having a kid take a lot of that from what their family would say.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  They'd be like, are you kidding me?
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  You know, and Linda died because she wasn't vaccinated.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Of course you're going to vaccinate your kids.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  And it's, you know, that now though,
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  I'm not trying to say that pre internet that nobody questioned their doctor.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Of course. I mean, you know, the second opinion is part of our vernacular.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  You know, of course people might question their doctor,
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  especially if, you know, the recommendation was surgery or something like that.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  But now it's so easy for people to just find what they want to find
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  whereas you couldn't do that before.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And there's that stencil.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  It's a spray painted stencil.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  It's all, you know, you can't go anywhere that's seeing it,
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  where the saying stop making stupid people famous, right?
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Which is trite, but it's true.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  It is absolutely the problem of the modern age is that we've made a lot of stupid people very famous.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  But we also feel like, think about something like WebMD.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  And I don't think any of us can say we've never looked at WebMD
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  or pretty sure we have cancer.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Like, you know, there is also the internet has empowered us to believe
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  that we can learn a lot on our own.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  I guess this is kind of what you're already saying.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  But, you know, now we feel like there's this resource
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  in the same way that we might not go spend several weeks at the library,
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  you know, looking up carcinoma.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Now, today, like we'll keep looking until we find the thing that makes sense to us.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And it's, you know, yeah, the worst thing you can possibly do
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  when you have some kind of health problem is Google it.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  And it's, of course, the first thing that we all do.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I mean, you can't help but do it.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  But it's the worst thing you can do.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Totally.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Because it's just going to, it now you have whatever your problem is
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  and now you've got terrible anxiety about it.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Because you've proven that you have, you know, something incurable.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  Have you ever gone into a doctor's office with a printout?
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  No, I have not.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  They do not like that.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Nope.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  But I'm not saying I wouldn't, though.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Right.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I'm not saying I wouldn't.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I'm just saying I haven't.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  See Amy doing a lot of research.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  I could see her being a very well-informed, you know, with kids stuff.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I could see her being a very well-informed parent, all that stuff.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Yeah, I think she's very serious, hyperinformed, you know.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And hyper vigilant, right?
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Like, she's got that, she's got that epipen, like, you know,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  she's like martial dealing with that thing, right?
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  Yeah, and she does.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  She really does know an awful lot about it.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Again, I think she'd be the first to tell you that she does not know more
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  than our Jonas' allergist does.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  But she certainly knows a lot more than she used to.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  But I do think that that's, I don't know, I feel like that's a big part
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  of the problem of the modern age is that you're going to be, you know,
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  there's a, it's easy for anybody to have a soap box and get, you know,
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  more than just the people who can, you know,
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  and the old days if you're a lunatic, only the people within your shot
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  could hear you now, anybody can listen.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Yeah, it's funny.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  There's all these little, setting aside the dark web or the dark
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  nut or whatever.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  There's this one funny, sort of source of information for me.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  So, you know, I think that's what I think that's what I think.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  There's this one funny sort of source of information that's been around
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  for a long time, but still remains largely hidden from plain sight,
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  which is forums or for, I guess.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  There are so many places with you, Google for certain kinds of information,
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  all kinds of certain kinds of information.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  You are very likely to, and I just, somebody suggested, for example,
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  yesterday I was talking, I think yesterday I'm back to work, talking about how I'm trying
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  much coffee, you know, I don't want to be too spazzy, and somebody had recommended this stuff
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  called L Theanamine or something like that, which is like a green tea extract or something.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And so I went in, and I Googled it, and like so many results on forums
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  where people are like saying the most outlandish things, but like I kept reading it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  I immediately felt like, you know, I got to take all this with a grain of salt,
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  but I still kept reading looking for somebody who sounded like they knew what they were talking about.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  And I have no way of knowing if anybody knows what they're talking about.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  I think it's a very common thing.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  I find that as I'm getting older, and I find that I'm getting a lot more sensitive to things like having drunk too much coffee.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  And I don't think it's like, I think it's actually more of like a self-awareness though than like,
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  not that I used to be able to metabolize more, it's that I would drink too much coffee and wouldn't even notice.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Whereas now I'm like, wow, my brain is bananas right now.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Oh yeah, I talk about this a lot on the show with Dan.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  I mean, I have to be very circumspect about something that sounds unbelievable to me now,
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  which is that I have to be very careful about how much caffeine or stimulants in general I put in my body after about 12 or 1.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Because they say the half life, or like mostly out of your body in like 8 hours, and that's not true for me.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I'll just be laying, if I have a coffee at 2, I'll just be laying there in bed with my heart beating.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  And also, the thing I said, other places, is I feel like I don't always get the same positive effects that I used to get, but I definitely still get all the negative effects.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  You know what I mean? Where I don't used to be where I was like, oh, I'm young and virile, and I can have Thai food and coffee at 11 at night.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  And now today, that's just a terrible idea for me.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  So yeah, the sensitivity for real. Yeah, there's lots of stuff like that. Food's too. I mean, anyway.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  I make the same amount of coffee every day. And I think it's, you know, it's like the right dose for me.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  But then like, I use, I don't really do anymore. Like sometimes I just get bored at 4 in the afternoon and think, well, I'll have another, I'll, you know, go make one.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  I don't know my whole life. That's exactly what I would do.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  I'll support people eat at 3 o'clock, and I'm like, I want to have a coffee.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  I'll go make one, I'll make one cup with the AeroPress, and then I'll, you know, taste a little better.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  And, and then I'm, you know, at like 6 p.m. I'm like, wait, I've been trying to read this 800 word article for half an hour.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  And instead I've got 20 other tabs here. I won't really wanted to read this article. What happened to it?
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  I totally had that this morning. I had to do that. And then I'm like, good.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Well, and then I'm like, that's a freaking coffee. I should not have had that extra coffee.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  I did that this morning. I had two cups of coffee, and I sat down to read the entire Wikipedia page on the history of the MPAA rating system, which doesn't seem that hard.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  You know, it's pretty standard English. I got like, I got like two headings in and I was like, let's ride bikes. I couldn't even concentrate.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  So I'm slightly prepped, but.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  All right, let me do one more sponsor. Okay. And that is our good friends at Fracture. And you guys know Fracture. Fracture is a place you send them your photos, your images.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  They print those photos directly onto glass. And then they put them in a really cool cardboard package that serves after you open the package as the thing that you can use to hang it on a wall or the thing you can fold out to prop it up on your desk or your mantle or wherever you want to put it.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  All self contained right there and your photos printed beautifully directly on glass.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  It's the same analogy that it comes across like the way when they started laminating the LCDs to the iPhone displays and makes the pixels look like they're right on the glass.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Well, that's what your printed photos look like when you get them from Fracture. Really beautiful.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  I just can't emphasize how easy it is once you get them in your house, it's ready to be hung. You don't have to take it and go get the frames that IKEA or wherever and then put the photo in the frame.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  It is a frame. It's right there. It has no border. It's beautiful. Great, great gift idea. Probably too late I guess for you guys for Valentine's Day, but I don't know. Mother's Day is coming up.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  That's for sure. Great gift idea. Just go there. Check them out. And they have great prices. They have all sorts of sizes from really small to really, really big.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  There's the square ones so you can print your Instagrams, whatever you want to do. Really great stuff. I cannot emphasize enough. If you have any reason that you want to print a photo, take a good photo of your kid.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  I should get this one hanging on the wall. Go to Fracture. Do it there. You will not regret it.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  There are websites. FractureMe.com. FractureMe.com and they have a code, Daring Fireball, all one word, and you'll save 15% on any order. That's real cash. Go to FractureMe.com. Get a photo printed out and use that code Daring Fireball. You'll save some money.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  All right. Here's the idea. What do you want to do? You mentioned it because it was actually your idea at first. Well, the basic idea. I'm not to turn it into a parenting podcast, but it's the overarching dilemma of what movies do you let your kids watch when?
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  What age? Where do you balance this? I have found it to be from the get-go from when he was Jonas was old enough to just sit in front of a TV. It's a vexing dilemma.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  I never anticipated it. I never anticipated it being difficult. I just always thought before I had a kid that at any given moment you could give me any movie or TV show.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  I could instantly tell you whether it was age-appropriate or not, but it ends up being, I think, devilishly tricky.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Well, exactly right. The only thing I would want to establish is that we went to college and stuff. We understand that there are things like ratings.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  I think the part that makes this so challenging is how different every kid is in terms of what they are sensitive to what's likely to be problematic or cause troubles and nightmares.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  It's not as simple. I would postulate. It's not nearly as simple as just saying, I'm going to trust the MPAA.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  Because there are plenty of g-rated movies with stuff in it that a three-year-old, some three-year-olds, right? A given three-year-old, should not see.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And if the parents know that, it's really good to avoid that.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  One that comes up a lot is scary music, a genre of what's just called scary music.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  We're going into the woods. Some kids that could watch somebody be decapitated, freak out. My daughter thinks jumping into an out of frame. Completely freak her out.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Oh, yeah. You know, like in a horror movie kind of thing.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  Like in the background pops up. Even in any kind of a movie, no matter how innocuous, it can kind of freak her out.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  So yeah, exactly. It's not, the thing is, and then on the other hand, there are some kids where like if you fast forward through this one scene or this other scene, they would be totally fine watching some PG-13 movies.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  And it's just, I think it's, I'm sure we both have some horror stories about terrible decisions.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  But also just, I think it's interesting to talk about because I think everybody wants to look like they're real smart about it.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  And I think almost everybody who lets their kid watch movies worries about it.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Where's about getting the mix wrong? Yeah. And I'll give you one example from Jonas when he was young.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  And we, I would say on the grand scheme of things, we are relatively permissive. And we always have been.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  But I think, I do. And, but also because I used to shake my head when you would tell me things that you would let him do. And now I do the same stuff.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  But also, I really feel like a big part of that, though, was knowing what he was good with. And he was good.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  I think with relatively advanced like violence and movies, you know, he watched Star Wars very, very young.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And, you know, I don't think that they're, I watched them when I was in kindergarten too. I was my thinking. I don't know. I was in kindergarten when I came out and I turned out all right.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  But I remember, but you never know, though, there's always little things. So one of the, we, we let him watch the Pirates of the Caribbean movies at a very early age.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And I think that those are PG, I don't think they're PG 13. I don't know man, they got some pretty spooky stuff.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  But he didn't, but the point is he didn't mind it. No, not at all, except for one scene, which is, and I don't remember which one of them it's in.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  But there's one scene where, I must have been the first one where they were going after the gold that if you stole the gold, you became a ghost or whatever, and you had to drop a piece of blood.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  And they cut somebody, somebody takes a knife and just puts like a little like a PG rated cut on the palm of somebody's hand.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  And he, it just flipped him out and I had like a fit and he was like, we're like, what's wrong? What's wrong? And he just was holding his hand and he said, like, I can feel it. I can feel it. And he's just screaming like it made him feel as though his hand had been cut.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  I kid will come compulsively. I was the word I'm looking for will like automatically like violently turn away from the screen whenever there's blood like, you know, like a cut or something like that or like a wound and it's, it's she absolutely turns away. Yeah. And so we just like, you know, it's like, you know, middle of the day noon, you know, me working at home, you know,
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  which I was probably, you know, five, six years ago. And we both looked at each other like we just gave each other this look like, oh my God, what have we done, we've, we've wrecked this poor child's mind by letting him watch this movie that we should have known he was too young to watch.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  But you just never know. And then, and he would be good. He wouldn't refuse to watch that movie, but I'll tell you what, he had it down stone, he knew exactly when that scene was coming up and he would run out and he would say, what he used to say, he'd call it past, past forward.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  If I thought I would say fast over Pat, you said that any fast over that anytime when they got to the point where in Toy Story 2 when Buzz has to the beginning in the video game when he has to walk out across the floating discs. Oh, yeah.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  She would I say daddy fast over fast over. I like that one too. They're both good. Pass forward. Oh my God. It's a Jonas's list included the Wampa, no Wampa. Oh, and that's a good. That's another example of a jumping into frame thing. Yeah, you know what? That's it. Yeah.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Because you know, and they, and the suspense, right? It's because the Wampa, at the first time you see him, it's the shocker, right? Like Luke is like looking for comments or whatever to hit the, you know, hit the ground and all of a sudden boom, the Wampa jumps into frame and makes a terrible noise.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  So you've got that, right? And yeah, that Jonas didn't like that. And Jonas wanted that whole, the whole thing skipped though because he also could not bear the suspense of Luke.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Hang in there like a side of beef. Yeah, and not, you know, it's like the first time he's ever even tried to use the force to get a lightsaber and it's just sitting there jiggling, you know, it's like, you know, it's like film school 101, you know, like how to build a little suspense.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  You know, jiggle the lightsaber, do this, the mute, you know, a perfect, of course, John Williams score for the moment, which furthers the, the suspense couldn't take it.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  It just is, it would just happen.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  What about, um, one that I was scared of and my kid was scared of, what about when, in episode four, when Luke's looking through the binoculars and the Tuscan Raider was, no, not at all.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  Even though, to me, it's actually just the, it's the same thing, right? Yeah, totally.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Yeah, didn't bother him. Nope. That's so weird. See, this is what I'm talking about. All right, the Wampa terrifying, the Tuscan Raider who does the exact same thing.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  You know, but, you know, here's, but you get, I remember talking about how about this and about how his daughter, he felt like his daughter was, you know, very sensitive to certain kinds of things.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  She's a really sweet kid and like relationship things and some people are very sensitive to almost everything and other people, it's virtually impossible to tell.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  My daughter has seen some really grizzly shit in movies. Like she saw Deadpool putting her head, putting his head back on at the end of an XM.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  I didn't show her the whole movie. I was just like, you got to see the scene where Deadpool puts his head back on. It's pretty great. A terrible movie.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  But, but there are some things where I can't guess. Okay. So for example, she's watched a ton of Doctor Who, little scared by the Daleks.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  She's watched, uh, pretty much almost every Marvel movie except for a few and all the Star Wars movies, numerous times.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  But then, you know what we watch? Did you ever see that that show on Cartoon Network from last year called Over the Garden Wall?
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  No, it's kind of like it's an adventure time thing about these two little boys who are brothers having these like kind of fairy tale adventures combined with like a silly symphony's cartoon feel.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  It's a really great show, but it is like a fairy tale kind of show where there's scary stuff that's not exactly explained.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  It's a, but it's a kids show. It's like it is in the same ways adventure time kind of, it's kind of a kids show.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  And that is the one stuck with her, this creature on there called the Beast. And I didn't find out for weeks that like she thought the Beast was under her bed.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  She was scared to even say anything. And I was like, oh honey, I am so sorry. And mom of course gives me the eyes. It's like, see, see, see. I knew this was going to happen.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  But again, would you guess I mean like she didn't mind people's faces melting off and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the idea of like a black beat this kind of cartoon bear in the forest is terrifying.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Who knows?
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Yeah, I remember I had a friend growing up who I miss. I don't know how, but I missed Raiders of the Lost Ark when it was in the theaters. So I didn't see it.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  But it always bothered me. I was, I was about 1314. I was, I was eight. Okay. So, you know, I are nine eight. I think it was 1981. So I was eight.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  But I desperately wanted to see it. Couldn't understand how I missed it. You know, seemed like something I could have got my dad to take me to. Somehow I missed it.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  But then, you know, of course, once it was out of theaters, there was no chance to see it. But I knew the basic story.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  And I just knew that there was something about it at the end. Everybody's faces melted. And my one friend growing up was like completely freaked out about it.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  Like he had gone to see it and came out like crying, like embarrassed himself like his mom, you know, came out of the movie theater.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Oh, no.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  It wasn't the type of kid.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Because it isn't just that like, haha, little skin melts off. It's like a full on Ray Harry housing thing where like their entire head like it's a horrifying, really effective effect.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  Yeah. Yeah. But he was freaked out. And he was the type of kid who just would not, you know, he wasn't like a sense. He wouldn't call him a sensitive kid. You really wouldn't.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  You know, it's just a normal boy who's going to see what should be.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  And that just was something to be his thing. Yeah. Like it just touched a nerve.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  What about, um, have you seen either the trailer or the movie for Paddington?
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  That's probably a little young for Jonas. Yeah.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  We're seeing the trailer, right? I've seen the trailer.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Okay. The trailer I have heard from friends that the movie is, well, it's one of those movies.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  One of those rare movies where the movie is actually way better than the trailer looks, which I'm very glad to hear.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  But you've seen the trailer. There's a scene where he's in the bathroom. I don't know. I'm going to someday my daughter's going to hear this. I'm going to be in so much trouble.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  There's a scene in the bathroom where he's like interacting with what it is to be a bear using the bathroom.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  And he takes a toothbrush and sticks it in his ear and pulls out this giant wad of totally disgusting looking earwax.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  It's a dumb shot. It's about three seconds.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  And if I say the word Paddington, my key gets freaked out. She cannot stop thinking about the disgusting earwax.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  She will hear nothing about going to see that movie because of this one scene with earwax.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Remember, she's seen Deadpool put his head back on. But the earwax thing put her off her beer.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  Yeah. It's inexplicable.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  Here's the, if I kind of toss out one more axis in bad parenting is the balance weighing the balance.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  Okay, so let's take an extreme example.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Like, would you hesitate a kid who's like a classic introduction to movies age of like five?
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  Like, would you show your kid the third X-Men movie if they're five years old?
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  See, now me, I'm going to go, you know what? I'm not.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Because it's not a very good movie.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  There is a lot of inside words in it as we say in our house.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  There is some violence in it, but you know what? It's just not worth it because whatever she sees it,
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  it's not worth it because the movie's not that good.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Would you hesitate to show your kid Toy Story 2? Oh my gosh, no.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  It's got scary things in it a little bit, but it's so worth it, right?
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  So isn't that part of the balance though?
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  It isn't like you're making your kids sit there and watch Castle Freak or something.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  Like you're thinking like, oh, this is a perfect, is this the perfect age to introduce this wonderful story to this kid?
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Yeah, that's a very good point.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  It has to be, you know, the quality of the movie factors in it.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  I mean, in my own defense, I'm sitting there with her watching the movie, like,
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  you know, except in the case of Mulan 2, one of my iPad, like I am there watching the movie with her.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  We're talking about the movie, not that it's like, you know, frickin' Harvard or something.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  But just to be clear, like, it's got to be a movie I like, it's got to be good,
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  and it's got to be appropriate given what I can know or guess.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  I totally agree with that. I think, you know, what else had Jonas seen early.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  I mean, he saw the Bond movies back when Dan and I were talking about them.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  I mean, I don't know if you watched all of them with me, but he sat through a bunch of them with me.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  And that was weird on two levels, because it also, in addition to the fact that it's kind of violent for a kid who's probably six or seven at the time,
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  there's the anachronisms, right?
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  I mean, none of, you know, I think Dan and I spent like half an hour just talking about that.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  Got you on the pacing.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  And this is one that blew me out of the water.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  Essentially that picture of my kid punching gold finger in the face at a casino.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Here's the thing, I was, I knew this one was going to be a long time.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  People are going to think that that, yeah, that was like a total Merlin euphemism,
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  but that you literally sent me a text with a picture of your daughter next to a picture of gold finger.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  This is mural of James Bond characters punching gold finger in the face.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Okay, so, okay, and this one I barely barely barely got this one past the sensors.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  My wife was pretty iffy about this.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Because if it's one where we're really worried, I will watch the entire movie through again to be sure.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  I definitely, we have to find time to talk about 80s movies and how what completely weird animals 80s movies are.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Because you never know when some boobies are going to show up in 80s movie.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  It's crazy.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  But, gold finger, I was like, oh, it really is the best James Bond movie.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  And it's kind of a silly plot, but it's not that hard to follow.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  But, you know what my main thing was?
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  I was like, she is going to watch.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  She'll watch up to when he takes off the scuba thing and have his talks on.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  That's pretty funny.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  But I was like the pacing of this movie by her standards is so glacial.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  There's no way she's going to watch more than 20 minutes.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  And then it became the movie that she demanded to watch.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  It was completely perplexing.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  She's watching a thing where people are sitting drinking mint julips and Kentucky
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  and talking about contaminating gold.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  I was blown away.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  So again, man, I had no idea.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  The end of being one that she really likes.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  And also when the laser almost cuts him in the penis,
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  she turns it goes, it's going to cut him in the penis.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  We did it in 2011.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  So Jonas was seven.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  And when I let him watch same hair with her.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Yeah, seven.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  Seven here.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  I don't think I watched it when I was seven.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  It was on TV once a year.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I think the same way.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  I don't know.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  I mean, you know, one thing too with the violence.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I know.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  And I know a lot of the, you know, there's,
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  what are the big three?
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  There's violence, language, and sex.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  I mean, that's the big three like concerns.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  You got smoky.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  You got sass mouth.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  But I would say violence.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  And scariness.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Scariness is, I would say scariness is probably the top issue.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Because I really do think that the, you know, like a truly scary movie,
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  you know, can upset a kid for days.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  I do realize I absolutely realized that there are some kids,
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  a lot of times boys, who if they see like a movie
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  where there's a lot of like shooting action,
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  even in a sort of cartoony way, like Star Wars,
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  that it gets the kid all amped up
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  and then the kid starts jumping around the house,
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  smashing things.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Right.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Right.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Or like, like I've shown her bits.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  I've shown her YouTube videos of Bruce Lee,
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  like a best of Bruce Lee or something like that.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And she just wants to kick everything after that.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Well, or worse that you want a kid to want to kick other kids
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  or something like that.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  Well, Jonas has never, ever been like to.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Jonas is a very gentle kid.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  And it's anything that he sees in a movie
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  does not alter his behavior, you know, in the real world.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  So I mean, I think it allowed us to be a little permissive,
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  you know, in that way.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  But I think most kids are actually pretty good that way.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  I think it's kind of rare, you know.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  So the violence we've always, you know,
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  I don't know, been a little liberal on.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  It depends on the violence.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  It depends on, I mean, you know,
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  the thing is there are phrases that I would hear people use
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  before I had a child and I would just,
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  I would want to strangle the person.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  The phrase, a phrase I used to this sneer at,
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  imitative behavior, you know,
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  that's sometimes in these reviews.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  You'll see, well, it contains, you know,
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  sass mouth and imitative behavior.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Meaning, you know, the three stooges, right?
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  That's a good example.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Like if you watch enough three stooges,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  you're probably going to want to hit somebody on the head,
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  you know, Maggie Simpson with the mallet or whatever.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  But I think, I think there's also,
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  I have a poem, this is really where I don't know.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I'm out on a limb, but I think there are differences.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  There's different kinds of violence.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  I think stormtroopers, getting bloodlessly shot
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  with comic book violence, is really different from hell raiser.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Or like saw.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  I think there is a really big difference in degree
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  and the personalness of it.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  So like there are some things, and again,
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  we gotta talk about 70s and 80s movies.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  There is so much completely random,
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  weird nudity and sex in 70s and 80s movies,
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  especially 80s movies.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  But there's also some like extremely personal violence
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  in those kinds of movies.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  So like the idea of like holding somebody
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  with a knife to their throat and cutting them,
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  I think of that as a different kind of animal
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  than a stormtrooper getting shot personally.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Yeah, I do too.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Or even with just sticking to guns with,
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  like when bond, especially in the older ones,
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  when bond shoots somebody,
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  it's practically like shooting a stormtrooper.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  I mean, it's like, you know, like the squib,
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  the squib in the chest was just like a puff of smoke
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  and the guy just, you know, falls into,
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  you know, sharks with lasers pit.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Whereas I think the more visceral violence
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  and the more recent ones, like the crag ones,
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  you know, is a little different.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Oh my gosh.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Oh, no, no, no.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  I mean, no, a lot different.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Yeah, I mean,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  I'm sorry to give you some beef jerky.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  I thought I could pull it off.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Hmm.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  How's it going?
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  What do you think about,
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  what do you think about the actual ratings?
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I still think it was a mistake
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  to introduce the rating PG-13.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  I find it, well,
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  it certainly was easier at one time
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  to understand everybody knew what our rated meant.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Our rated meant you could expect some,
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  some serious nudity and simulated sex.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  You could expect some shits and fucks
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  and you could expect smoking and drugs
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  and, you know, French connection.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  That's an R-rated movie.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  That was easy to understand.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Now, when, like per that article,
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  I won 10th read today, 1984 comes along.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  You've got, was it Temple of Doom?
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  No.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Temple of Doom and Gremlins.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  We're two movies that people were just like,
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  this is just,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  now Gremlins, I think I could see Gremlins
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  freaking my kid out, personally.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  And so it's kind of a weird movie.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Yeah, it is a weird movie.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  We just re-watched it, not recently,
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  but maybe like last Christmas,
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  because it's sort of a Christmas movie.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Yeah, it is.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  So like a year ago.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  But even something like a movie we all love,
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  it's, they take a movie like Groundhog Day.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  If Groundhog Day had just the smallest bit of editing,
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  it would be maybe a canonical family movie.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  It's so close to being a Ghostbusters.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  You know how much nookie there is in Ghostbusters?
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  You had a fake blowjob?
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  You got, remember that?
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Remember that? And where Dan Echroy gets the ghost blowjob?
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I do.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  And it's like, what's this doing in this movie?
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  It's just a movie for kids.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  Or just, you know, there's all these movies.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  This is still true today.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  I know with the Marvel movies,
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  they're usually pretty good with the salty language
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  until like the last act.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  And that's when all the Shitson fucks come out.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  It's always like, what is the rule?
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Isn't there kind of like a standard for how many
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  you're allowed in a PG-13 movie?
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Yeah, I think there's some kind of.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And I think they like to really load them up in the back
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  for when the closing action.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  And I'm just saying, like, that's the part that's perplexing.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Is there like, are you going to tell me Ghostbusters
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  is not right for kids?
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Oh, here we go, back to the future.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Like there's some stuff back to the future is a great
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  great family movie that still has some stuff in it.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  That's a little edgy.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  I mean, you know, he's in his underwear.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  I guess that's not a big deal.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  But you know, it's straight home alone.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  I mean, would you, home alone?
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  That's a kid's movie, right?
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Yeah, we've watched him.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Yeah, it's an iron in the face.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  That's, that's worse than Wolverine.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  I don't know.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  I don't know.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  I don't know.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  I don't know.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  The violence in home alone is kind of weird because it's,
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and on one hand, it's like they're kind of going for that
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  three-stuages thing.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  And on the other hand, there's like actual acid, like,
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  what about when you're walking up the steps in bare feet
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  and you see the nail sticking out of the step.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And you're like, this is the most horrific thing
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  that I've ever seen.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Because every kid's terrified, your parents
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  could be terrified about getting tetanus from a nail, right?
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  And he steps on in like a three-inch exposed like nail.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Right.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  And it's, it's an interesting movie because it,
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  it does though, but like his, what's it in Kevin?
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Young Kevin's mastery of these two buffoon criminals
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  is established cinematically such that you kind of get the sense
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  that the kid's going to come out on top.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And that he's, you know, and that therefore his,
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  his mastery of, of these two criminals,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  the way that he prolongs their stuff,
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  it really does kind of in a, in a sense,
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  it's a little bit more like torture than it's self-defense.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  No, it's, it's like grandgienial.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  It's, like, he's deliberately making this as awful as he can.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Yeah, it's less self-defense and more torture.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  He's kind of a joy.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  Oh, man.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Actually, I think there's a couple of scenes where, like,
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  one of his, you know, traps works,
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  and he just flat out like high fives himself.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  That's, that's what I gotta pick that up,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  which does the, like, or fist out and pumps it in.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Yes.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Fuller, go easy on the Pepsi.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  I love that movie.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  But I don't know.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  I'm just saying, okay, no, how about this?
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  PG-13.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  So they, they, I think it was a mistake,
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  because I think that the old way was G,
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  that's a kid's movie.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  That's for everybody.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  PG is, it's in between and R is for adults.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  And it doesn't matter why.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It doesn't matter if it's violent.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  PG says it all.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  PG says, like, your mileage may vary.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Like, yeah.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  You know, it, it basically, it almost kind of says,
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  like, you need to, like, watch this before your kids do.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  Practically.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Or like, be advised, right?
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Yeah, be advised.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  Think about it.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  You know, if your kid is younger,
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  and if your kid is over 10, it's probably,
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  probably good.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Yeah.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  You know.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  Yeah, I don't know, but it's, again,
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  to me, the hard part is this sense.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  I said you're linked to this website
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  that I look at a lot.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  And I, I, I'm somewhat ambivalent about it.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  And yet I find it extremely useful.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  I cannot believe I'm saying this.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  Have you seen that?
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  You just look at that link, kids in mind.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  Yeah.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  It's a very interesting idea,
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  because they go out and they review these movies.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  But it's very funny.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  So the, the, the, the, not if it is,
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  they come up with these, these three, like,
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  woo, three numbers.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  Not numerals, because there's a 10.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  But how much sex and nudity, nudity is there,
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  from zero to 10.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  How much violence and gore from zero to 10?
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  How much profanity from zero to 10?
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  Which I think it's, it's a great, like, you know,
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  at least a fast glance, where, I mean,
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  sometimes I use this to go like,
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  okay, we're thinking about these two different movies,
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  like which one of these looks better on the face of it?
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  And it's sometimes, you know what I mean?
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  It's a quick sniff test.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  Pretend that you go in and look at the actual page
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  at like how it's like porn,
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  where they describe all the stuff that's actually in it.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  No, I didn't.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  I'm looking at it now.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  It's a sponge sponge.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  And the way they describe it is hilarious.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  I want to meet the person who writes this.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  SpongeBob movie, which I absolutely do not want to see.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  Sex and nudity, you get it too.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  We see many human men on the beach with bare chests.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  Many women wear skimpy bikinis and reveal cleavage.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  A sponge accidentally pulls the shorts
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  partially down from a starfish's waist.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  And we see the upper buttocks and buttock cleavage.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  I've got one there for Mordecai, a husband and his wife
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  attempt to kiss several times in different scenes,
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  but his moustache makes her gag.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  And he gags and reflex.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  Oh my god.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Please see the violence and gore category
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  for more details on the gag.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  But it doesn't read like something like a Japanese man would buy for porn.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  American Sniper, profanity gets a 10.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  About 115 F words and its derivatives,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  10 sexual references, 32,
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  got a logical terms, 20 anatomical terms, 12 mild obscenities,
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  name calling, including sunshine,
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  quitter, nuts, old man, hot box,
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  arrogant self-centered sitting ducks legend.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  See, why can't somebody run all of those down, John?
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Why count all 115 fucks?
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Because clearly, I mean, how long is the movie?
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  Even if it's three hours.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  You're on the two hours or two hours and 12 minutes.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  So it's roughly one a minute.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  You fucking minute.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  Right.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  Unless there's like a burst at the end.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  It's, you know, I think you only have to go
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  about two or three movies or minutes into this movie.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  And you can just check off 10 on a profanity.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  Some of these.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Oh my God.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  All right.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  It's like this.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  If you're like the inspector for a hotel,
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  like you don't have to count the bus.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  Oh, like once you see five rats in the lobby.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  Yeah.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  New Dealers, check that off.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  You just check it off.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  You don't have to count them.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Right.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  You don't have to count them.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  1998 film, a lot of people,
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  a lot of families have enjoyed,
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  called the Big Lebowski.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  Profanity, they give it a 10.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  About 240 F words.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  Oh my God.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  Many eschatological references.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  Many anatomical references.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  Many mild obscenities.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  Hate to fix dine a cobble.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  This is great.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  I love this,
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  but I know that I'm going to lose a lot of time on this site.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  Like,
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  Oh, I know.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  But the things I can't show it to my wife.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  I mean, I can't.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  She's a greenhouse woman.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  But, you know,
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  it makes it's when you read it in this clinical way.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  It makes it sound so much worse.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  When they say a starfish's swimsuit is pulled down
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  and reveals buttocks,
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  guys, that's Patrick.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  It's Patrick's butt.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  He's a goddamn cartoon character.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  It's okay if we see his butt.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  All right.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  I looked up a fantastic Mr. Fox,
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  which is actually,
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  I was just talking,
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  I just watched it.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  I love it so much.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  I love it.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  I caught Keith called it.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  When I linked to a picture from it
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  and he said it's underrated.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  I think it's my favorite West Anderson.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  It's one of my all time favorite movies.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  Let alone one of our families.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  There's two movies.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  If we can't decide on anything
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  and it comes to blows,
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  it's either the Incredibles or Mr. Fox.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  That's it.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  I love it.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Those are,
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  those are two good ones to leave at the top of the queue.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  All right.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  So,
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  for sex and nudity,
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  it's only ranked a one out of ten,
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  which meshes with my memory.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Here's what we've got.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  We've got.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  Is it Chris Jefferson in a swimsuit?
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  It has been in a wife,
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  kissing Fox, kissing hug, a teen boy and a teen girl,
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  Fox flirt in a couple of scenes.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  I do remember that.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  You're supposed to be my lab partner.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  I know.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  That you're not your disloyal.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Number two.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  A rat refers to a fox's wife as the,
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  quote,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  town tart.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  Right.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  I never.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  A fox wife tells her
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  fox husband that she is pregnant.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  So that gets counts for a one
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  on the sex nudity skin while you're in a cage.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Oh man.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  But again, you know what this is though.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Okay.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  So I just got to say,
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  this is actually really helpful though,
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  because like you say,
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  this is the rats in the lobby title.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  It's like you can see like,
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  no, no, no, no, no.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Big Lebowski is not going to be great
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  to watch with the kids.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  Am I wrong?
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  No, we're going to skip this one.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  But it is also good that you can go through
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  and look for like the trigger,
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  stuff like a trigger for your kids.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  27 exclamate.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  This is for profanity.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  27 exclamations.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  What the cuss.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  Cuss words.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  What the cuss.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  They count that as a cuss word.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Cuss is a cuss word.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  Clustor cuss.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  They have a
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  scatological terms glossary.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  You get f-word derivatives,
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  which all have little asterisks in them.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Scatological terms, religious profanities.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  Friggan would be counted as a mild obscenity.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Derogatory terms.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Wow.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  But you know, I still,
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  I gotta say, no, let me ask you if you remember this.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Do you remember?
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  I'm going to say circa mid to late 90s.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  Do you remember a service that was actually kind of like
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  what became Netflix where you could get edited movies?
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  I think it might have been a somewhat overtly Christian place,
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  but you could get like a PG movie
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  that had all of the stuff a certain kind of really just person
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  would find offensive cutouts.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  I remember that at all.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  I do remember hearing about it.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  I don't know where it went or what it did,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  but isn't that, especially on the digital age,
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  it's a very interesting idea.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Yeah, because it would be, you know,
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  you could do it without losing fidelity.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  I mean, just some basic metadata on like,
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  well, you know, you could go in and be so great.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  Because if you could go in and say,
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  you know what my family is observant,
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  and we don't want any god dams.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Could you adjust with audio blip out the god dams
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  but leave in the horrific violence or whatever?
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Let's say you want to show your kids passion of the Christ.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  Let's go see what passion of the Christ looks like.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  But you know what I mean?
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  Because I got to say, I might find that,
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  it kind of goes against some of my values
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  about censorship or something,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  but that's what I'm asking for.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  There are some movies I am much more likely
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  that I have my daughter watch in a hotel room
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  because I know they've been edited down.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  They've taken out the really cool.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  We watched Highlander in a hotel room.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  And she thought it was a riot.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  I would never show that to her at home, unedited.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  I never thought about that,
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  but I'm not looking for a hotel at it.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  The director's cut,
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  and then there's Hilton's cut.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Wow, this is an unusual, unusual statistical spread
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  on passion of the Christ.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Sex and nudity, it gets a one.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Profanity, it gets a one.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Found some gore, full ten.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Oh my goo.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Letter dance, dance, letter dance, dance.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  I've been now looking for movies
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  that I have let Jonah see
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  that they don't even bother to list
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  because I'm so inappropriate.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  The shining is not listed.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Oh, come on.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Are you kidding me?
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  That I've let him see it?
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Wow.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  I think that's the only Kubrick movies.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  You're Batman.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Wow.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  She's never seen any Kubrick.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  That was recent, though.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  That was within the case.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  Oh, okay.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  Well, I think it was like last year.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  You're going to say popcorn.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  It's totally like 12 probably, right?
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  Clockwork Orange is going to have to wait.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Mm-hmm.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Because, yeah.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  But there are some things.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  I got, you know what?
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  I'm not going to tell you.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  I'll tell you when we're offline.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  But there's a movie that she has been dying
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  to see for like a year.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  And we've read some of the book.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  We've told her the entire story.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  She really wants to see Hunger Games.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  And I'm like, it's, she's seven.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Like that's, and again, why?
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  Too much personal violence.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Like the violence in Hunger Games.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  I'm going to tell you.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  I don't care.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  I'm 48 year old man.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  I'm going to say it.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  I love the Hunger Games.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  I thought it was a great movie.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  I thought it was a lot of fun.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  I thought it was very well done.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  And I just, I really liked it.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  And I cannot wait.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  It's one of those movies that I'm constantly saying to her,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  oh honey, I cannot wait until you're old enough to watch this with me.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Like that one.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  Blade Runner.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  What about Blade Runner?
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Is he a Blade Runner?
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  No.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  That's pretty.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  I think about that.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  Huh.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  There's the, the Darryl Hannah.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  Got the eye.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  You got the, you got the replicas doing some pretty bad.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Oh, you got Leon.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  You got Leon.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  There's some pretty bad stuff in that.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  I would probably let him watch it now though.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  He's 11.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  I would probably let him watch it.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  I'm worried how much, how much do they play up that Darryl Hannah is a prostitute?
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  That worries you.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  A little.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Okay.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  You afraid it's going to be imitated behavior?
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  Well, I don't know.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  I would probably want to get a skin job if you know what I mean.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  But I just say only, only within like the last year or so.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Oh sure sure sure.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  Probably.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Well, this Blade Runner rated.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  I must have been rated awesome.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  I think it's got to be rated R.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  Some of them are amazing though.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  I'm telling you.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  There's something about 80s movies that seems completely random.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Movies that in my head.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  I think of as being like maybe because I saw them when I was a young teenager.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  I'm like, I'm so blown away.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  There's just be boobs out of nowhere in the movie.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  Whoa.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Where did that be?
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  We just watched over Christmas.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  We watched weekend at Burnies.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  And how'd that go?
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  And he loved it.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  He absolutely loved it.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  But there were a couple of surprising 80s sort of boobies.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  I don't know how else to describe.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Well, and the thing was that it was so egregious.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  I think a lot of the movies I'm thinking of.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  It was by the time you had the actual, you know, VHS or beta cable.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  And certainly get it ready for distribution on TV.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  And if you think about something like Caddy Shack,
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  or you think about, you know, Caddy Shack, obviously way too much.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  But I can't wait till I can watch that with her.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  But we thought about it.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  We thought about it.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  And then we were like running it through our heads.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  And there's so much of it that's good.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  But you know, I appreciate it more later.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  I showed her some scenes.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  I showed her Carl finding the candy bar in the pool.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  I don't know when we're going to have the talk about what abortion is.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  But it's not going to be an actual Caddy Shack.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  So that waitress has a baby.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  But what was I going to say about that?
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  Oh, so but it was funny though.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  Because like I think about like how like egregious and unnecessary.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  So many of the boobies are where like you could tell they made it to be easy to cut out.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  We're just going to like, hey, it's a shot of a girl taking her shirt off me.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  Like what was that?
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  But like you had to have that in every 80s movie, early 80s movie.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  Think about like stripes, you know.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  I mean, these movies that are like kind of mostly okay in some ways,
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  but then are like super inappropriate in other ways.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  But yeah, there's got to be it.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  There's had to be like a scene where there were 23 year old.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  You're like having a pillow fight in a party.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Yeah, with feathered hair and they were either getting a hose down
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  or having a pillow fight.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Well, excuse me.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And off a lot of actresses got hose down or it suds out in completely mainstream Hollywood movies in the 1980s.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Let's have a car wash to save the orphanage.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  But there's no orphanage in the plot.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Sponges are soft.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Right.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  So what are we going to tell people?
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  How do we help people with this?
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  John, there are new parents out there.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  People were having babies like crazy people.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  How do we help people with this?
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  I don't know. I feel like you got to have faith in your kid.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  I feel like because I don't know.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  I just remember when I was a kid, when I was not allowed to watch certain movies,
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  it was a constant source of frustration for me.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And you felt, did you feel like a pariah?
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I did.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  And we had a neighborhood movie theater.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And it was so great.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  I think I had to have talked about this on the show at some point,
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  but it was probably years ago, probably with like Dan.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  But I didn't even have to cross the street.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  It was catacorn or like up and around the block from my parents' house.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  So I didn't even have to cross the street.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And it was called the Majestic.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  And it was an old time like Vaudeville theater.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  At some point in the 40s or 50s was turned into a movie theater.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  And it was connected to the fire company.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  So half the building was fire trucks.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  The other half was a movie theater.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  And it was just right out of central casting of like old time matinee movie theater.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  Velvet seats.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  Wow.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  Had a balcony, a big balcony.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Like you would go around the side.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And it was run by a family.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  The guy who owned it was Mr. Dieter.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Dieter or Dieter, I think.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  And he was probably around 50.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  And his dad was the projectionist and the ticket taker at the front door.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  And his dad, he must have been 75.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  But to our eyes as like eight, nine year olds, he was ancient.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  He was like older than God.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  He was older than the earth.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  And then the kids, his like,
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Nair do well, teenage son would sometimes be working.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  And it was such a great place.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Oh my God.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  Could you sometimes get away with it?
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Well, what you could sometimes get away with is if the kid was behind,
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  he had great popcorn.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Like the best popcorn in the universe.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  And they had, because it was like a little movie theater,
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  they never got movies when they were new.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  They got movies right after they were new.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  So like Empire Strikes Back would come out
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  and it would play for three months at the multiplex.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  And then the majestic would get it.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  For like, you know, however many weeks they wanted.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  And they would sometimes have like two movies at the same time.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  Even though it was just, you know, wasn't a multiplex.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  One screen.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  But like in the afternoon,
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  they might show like a kid's movie like Peter Pan.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  And then at nighttime, there was a, you know,
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  John Travolta movie or something.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  I don't know.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  And they would also show rock movies, like concert films
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  from the Stone movies kind of things.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  Yeah.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  Well, like just concert movies of like the Stones and Led Zeppelin
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  and stuff like that.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  And my parents always get mad because when they showed those,
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  like our backyard would get trash.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Kids coming out of the movie,
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  they would like cut through like,
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  and, you know, leave beer cans and stuff.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  It was such a great place.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  But I remember we used to go as a kid any Saturday
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  where it was, if it was winter,
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  or if it was rainy or whatever.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  We would just go to the majestic.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  We would just go that because it was like a dollar.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  A dollar matinee.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  Your parent, your mom wouldn't mind giving you the money.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  You'd be out of their hair.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  But every once in a while,
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  I remember one time specifically.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  I wasn't allowed,
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  all my friends were going.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  And they didn't give it.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Like one thing about Mr. Dieter is he didn't give two shits
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  how old you were.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  If you had your dollar, you could go see anything.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  So the Saturday matinee was Cujo.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  This whole story is my opinion.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  I was not allowed.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  My mom checked,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  and I knew she wouldn't let me see it.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  So I hope I just said,
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  can I go to the majestic?
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  And she said, what's playing?
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  I said, I don't know.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  She goes, well, let me look.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  She looks, you know,
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  in the newspaper, of course.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  And there it is.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  Cujo rated R.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  And now she can tell you,
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  you fit.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  And, well,
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  I don't know.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  I can't remember if I got comfortable.
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Because you would just sometimes go and see what's there.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  Yeah.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  And we would often go,
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  if they had the same movie two weeks ago,
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  we'd go see it twice in a row.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  And if we sat in the balcony last time,
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  we'll sit up in the front row this time.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  And, you know,
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  half the time when the balcony,
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  we would just sit up there and throw popcorn on teenagers
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  who were making out down below, you know, in the back.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  They're like little kids up in the front row,
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  little kids on the balcony,
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  and then like teenagers making out in like the back row.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  And we would like try to throw popcorn on them.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  Oh, the great thing,
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  they had video games in the lobby.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  I'm going to coin up.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  There's like a little mini arcade in the lobby.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  And you could play them.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  So I said that the old man's dad was the projectionist,
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  where the projection booth was up in the balcony.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  And it took him.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  I swear,
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  no joke,
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  like five minutes to walk up the steps.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  Like he was seriously old.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  And he would,
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  he was so old that he would take the steps like left foot
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  and then the right foot would be in the same step.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Oh, no.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  Left foot, right foot.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  So it was like a last call for video games.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  Like when his dad started going up the steps,
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  you knew you had time for,
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  you could still get one more game in.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  Without visiting.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  Without what a place.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  But I couldn't get into, I couldn't get into see Koojo.
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  And I remember, uh, blue lagoon.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  I remember missing out on the blue lagoon.
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  Oh, blue lagoon.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  Oh, blue lagoon.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  I remember seeing that on cable.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  Oh, brother.
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  But all my friends,
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  my friend's parents just didn't check.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  I think I don't think anybody's,
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  I was probably around eight or nine at the time.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  I don't think anybody in the right mind would let their
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  eight or nine year old see Koojo.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  Um,
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  but here's the thing too.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  I remember thinking I would be fine.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  I was not,
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I never once was upset by a movie in my entire life as a kid.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  I was, you know,
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  I think preternaturally mature.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  I could have,
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  and my friend saw Koojo and they were fine.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  Including my friend Dave,
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  who was the kid who got freaked out by Raiders of the Lost Star.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  He went to see Koojo.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  Thought it was a cool movie.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  If you know what you're in for, you know.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  I've never seen my Blade Runner story.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  I hung out with older kids a lot of the time.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  And I went back from Florida to visit my friends in Ohio.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  Whatever that summer was.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  Some Blade Runner was out.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  And they were all older than me.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  And they could pass.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  And I look like I was four.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  Oh, I'm just,
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  I'll never forget.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  We walk up there and they buy their tickets.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  In my hand of God,
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  I walked up to the counter.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  I think I was holding an unlit cigarette.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Maybe they'd give them me.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  I walked up to the counter and I go,
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  want a doll for Blade Runner.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  How old are you?
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  It was 13.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And like really want a doll.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Yeah.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Oh,
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Superman too.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Did you ever do that as a teenager?
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Like in your, in your,
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  like teenage years.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  Did you ever do the thing where you'd buy a ticket for one
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  that you know they'd sell you and then try to sneak in to.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  I never, that never occurred to me.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  It's such,
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  that's such a smart trick.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  I was scared to do anything.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  I was always scared to buy beer.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  I was scared to go to already movies.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  I was,
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  I was so,
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  I was such a good kid.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  You know,
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  like a good kid.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Like I did not want to disappoint anybody in authority.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  I was scared.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  I was scared.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  No,
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  I was a scammer.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  Like the rise of the multiplex.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  And then like,
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  once I was old enough.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  And those things,
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  the whole point is those things make money
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  because they're so understaffed.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  They got like one kid that walks around
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  and sweeps up popcorn.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  Once they know what he's paying attention to
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  who's going in this theaters,
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  you go and sit somewhere near an adult,
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  you're good to go.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  Like,
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  I think a bunch of Schwarzenegger's 80s movies
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  were R rated.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  You know,
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  all those,
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  it's just always shooting people up and blowing things up.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  But we'd go,
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  you know,
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  we would just go and buy tickets for,
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  I don't know,
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  whatever we thought we could get into it.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  And you could always sneak in.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  There was just always one guy,
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  like who would make sure you had a ticket.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  There is no money in pursuing that.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  No.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  I mean, there's money in running and selling,
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  you know,
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  Goobers in popcorn.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  There's no money in monitoring those theaters.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  I remember one time my friend Ethan and I went
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  to a multiplex to,
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  I forget,
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  was there girls involved?
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  It wasn't a date because I wasn't lucky enough to have dates,
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  but it might have been like,
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  it was like a teenage situation over there were girls involved.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And so I could kind of pretend like maybe it would be a date.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  And we wanted to see an R rated movie,
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  but we weren't like 13 anymore.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  We were maybe more like 15 or 16.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  And so we didn't think it would be a problem.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  And we asked for the R rated movie
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  and she said, no, you know,
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  do you have ID?
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  And we're like, no,
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  and she was like,
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  17.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  We're like, of course.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  And she's like, no,
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  you're not.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  And then we're like,
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  well, give us two tickets for, you know,
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  whatever it was PG.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  And she was like, no.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  Oh, no.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  Shit.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  And with my friend Ethan's brother had,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  had driven us and dropped us off.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Nice enough.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  He was like two or three years older.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  So he was like 17 or 18.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  And he hadn't gone yet.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  He was still,
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  you know,
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  we ran and got him.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And he bought us our ticket.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  Oh, you're kidding.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  Yeah, he bought us to,
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  but it was like,
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  but I still don't know how that got around the world.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  I have no respect
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  for people who buy beer for underage kids,
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  but people who buy,
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  I said the guy drinks a lot,
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  but somebody buy a movie tickets for kids.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  That's pretty cool.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  Yeah.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  But I don't know why she fell for that.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  She wouldn't fall for our,
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  we'll just buy the PG,
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  but she somehow fell for,
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  apparently once there's a 17 year old involved,
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  you can get anybody in there.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  Yeah.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  Show the ID.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  They can't say anything.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  That's the law.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  Right.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  I want to don't.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  I think we told her to do that.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  He was our parent.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  It's two years old.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  Well,
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  I'm not holding a finger under your nose.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Hello.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Right.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  My dad says it's okay.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Uh,
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  playrunner.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  I'll tell you what,
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  playrunner is a damn
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  borderline movie for 10,
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  10,
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  11 year old.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  You know,
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  there's, again,
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  there's that,
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  that Hunger Games die hard.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  There's so many movies
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  where I'm like,
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  you so can't see this yet,
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  but I really,
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  you know,
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  wait,
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  so my kid can see die hard.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Yeah.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  I remember,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  um,
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  my was not allowed to read,
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  um,
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  the catcher in the rye.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  And I don't even know why I wanted to.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  At some point,
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  I'd,
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  you know,
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  I'd become,
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  you know,
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  fairly avid reader
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  and,
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  my mom,
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  you know,
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  definitely my mom encouraged it
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  and, you know,
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  would,
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  I could buy books,
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  we'd get books at library.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  And at some point,
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  I wanted to read the catcher in the rye
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  because I'd heard it was a cool book or whatever.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  She thought about it.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  I could tell she was really thoughtful.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  And she was like,
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  you know,
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  it's a great book.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  I can't wait for you to read it,
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  but you're not,
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  you're not old enough yet.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  And,
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  and I,
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  I would ask like every six months,
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  can I read catcher in rye?
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  Can I read catcher in rye?
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  And eventually she let me,
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  and I forget,
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  I don't know how old I was,
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  but,
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  you know,
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  maybe like 12 or 13.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  And I read it.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  And,
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  I was expecting it
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  because it'd been so set up
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  by her not allowing me to read it.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  Yeah,
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  I thought be like
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Lolita or something.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  Yeah,
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  I thought it was going to be like,
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  you know,
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  I was like,
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  what the hell?
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  It's just a kid walking around.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  I appreciated that
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  both so much more when I got older.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  And you know what?
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  And I wish that's what my mom had said to me.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  I wish she hadn't made,
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  she was thinking too much
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  about some of the content
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  and some of the ideas.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  And I really,
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  really fundamentally,
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  it was more like,
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  you're,
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  you,
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  you shouldn't bother reading it now.
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  You won't appreciate it.
[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  Right.
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  Okay.
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Now in her case,
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  that's the trade off.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  That's kind of the trade off
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  we were talking about.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  It's a truly great book,
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  but you're not ready for it yet.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  And I'll tell you where I'm going with this,
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  is movie wise.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  It's actually rated G.
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  Content wise is not that bad.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  But I won't let
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  Jonas watch 2001.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  Right.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  Because I strongly suspect he'll be bored to tears
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  and I don't want him to get it
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  instead of this movie is bored.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  I tell,
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  or like,
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  or I mean,
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  watching the,
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  the ape stuff at the beginning
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  going like,
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  oh,
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  that is so fake.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  I wonder if you would think it's fake.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Some of it,
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  some of the back,
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  the,
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  the staging looks fake.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  I think the ape
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  stuff.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  I think it's better than you'd expect.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  That's,
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  that's for sure.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  But no,
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  I'm with you.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  That would be something that's kind of like
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  me with James Bond and her.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  Like,
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  I was amazed that she could tolerate the
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  pacing to watch gold finger
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  like three times now.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  It's,
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  it's crazy.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  There really is a
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  seated gold finger.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Are they just sit on a porch
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  and drink ventula?
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  Just,
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  it goes on and on.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  And then they have some discussions
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  about whether they should go in
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  or let James Bond keep doing
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  his thing.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  James Bond's in the cell.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  He's out of the cell.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  He's in the,
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  he's in the world's craziest.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  He's hiding under the world's
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  in the world.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  My God.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  What's the guy's name?
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Can I add him?
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  Oh my God.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  That,
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  that room.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  I love that room so much.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  And then every time,
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  every time we watch it,
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  when gold finger leaves to go
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  make his deal with the guy
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  who wants his money back,
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  I always do the same
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  stupid joke.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  Hey,
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  we wanted to play billiards.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  She's absolutely.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Hey,
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  I,
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  I should go.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  I got to try to get
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  to the strike cleaner.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  What are we going to do
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  to help people here?
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  I mean,
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  what do you,
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  your mileage may vary.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  What do we say?
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  What do people who think we're nuts?
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  But like,
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  well,
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  what would you say as a good piece
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  of advice?
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  I would say one is,
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  if it's a movie,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  you consider a classic.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  You think your kid is almost
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  ready for,
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  watch it yourself.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  With them not there.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  And also,
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  I would not be afraid
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  to fast over.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  Pass,
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  pass forward,
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  fast over.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  You got to watch it with them.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  Yeah.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  That's what I think.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  Still got to hold off on
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  die hard though,
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  I think.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  We just got
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  into die hard this year.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  This is a beautiful Christmas movie.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  10 years old.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  That's just about a perfect movie.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  Yeah.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  I don't know.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  I don't know why.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  I had it filed away
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  as something he could watch when he was 10.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  Yeah.
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  Well, thanks.
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Thanks for having me on,
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  man.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  It's always a pleasure.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  Oh.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  It is.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  We should just do this every
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  week and not put it out.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  No.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  I'd be good for us
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  to be good for us.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  I think we should
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  start our own version
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  of this kids in mind
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  and we'll do our own,
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  we'll do our own version.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  We're not going to count
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  the efforts.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  We'll just tell you
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  that.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Our site's going to be
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  called rats in the lobby
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  and we're just going to let you know
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  if your kids are real punk
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  or pussy.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  Just skip it.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  Rats in the lobby.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  Oh, God.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  That's the head.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  But that's it.
