[00:00.000 --> 00:04.520]  Still there. Oh, yeah, you know what it did it. Oh, you sound so much better
[00:04.520 --> 00:09.560]  You know what? I did I plugged it into a different USB port. Hmm. I got I think this is probably the last episode
[00:09.560 --> 00:11.560]  I'll record using this old
[00:11.600 --> 00:13.600]  air oh
[00:14.200 --> 00:20.300]  Are you gonna go to the new iMac now? Well, yeah, I guess I should I shouldn't why I don't record using the iMac
[00:20.300 --> 00:21.480]  I don't know
[00:21.480 --> 00:26.800]  Yeah, the air is powerful enough to do that. It's probably why the show sounds like shit
[00:26.800 --> 00:28.800]  Oh
[00:28.980 --> 00:35.900]  No, you know what and I actually know that this this old macbook air that I've used I I do it because I'm in some
[00:35.900 --> 00:38.220]  Ways, I'm a sentimental idiot and I think I've recorded
[00:38.900 --> 00:44.340]  Like every episode of the talk show for I don't know at least the last three four years using that air
[00:44.340 --> 00:48.520]  So I want to keep doing it. Yeah, I mean you said it makes no
[00:49.220 --> 00:50.180]  No, none at all
[00:50.180 --> 00:53.500]  But but you said not too long ago how in baseball as baseball fans
[00:53.500 --> 00:57.580]  There are people who are into the numbers and people who are into the story and that you're a story guy
[00:57.940 --> 01:02.900]  Right, right and yeah, you know the macbook air has got us got a story when I stopped using my road
[01:02.900 --> 01:07.660]  I was I was pretty nervous cuz I was like I've been using this since 43 folders Mac break weekly
[01:07.660 --> 01:12.860]  Like, you know, it's so dumb. It's I'm just changing to a better mic. Why would that matter?
[01:12.860 --> 01:17.380]  It shouldn't but I felt like a little bit disloyal. What did you switch to?
[01:18.020 --> 01:20.460]  Well, I tried a couple things. I'm using a sure
[01:20.460 --> 01:25.900]  SM 7b. No, it's got a it's super annoying cuz I got to go through a
[01:26.540 --> 01:28.580]  this pre-sonus
[01:28.580 --> 01:33.680]  Thing. Oh, I don't want that I dad that I think Marco was telling me about that. Yeah, I don't want to do that
[01:34.900 --> 01:39.980]  You know, I think I just listen to too much rock music. Hi when people have these conversations about stuff
[01:39.980 --> 01:45.220]  I just I just don't hear it. I don't hear what they're talking about. It makes me feel like a charlatan
[01:45.220 --> 01:53.220]  Okay, I don't I I mean I can notice in production values like when like the public radio show with a budget sounds different
[01:53.260 --> 01:59.820]  Than three guys talking about Linux, but like I don't notice that much about mics and stuff to you. No, I don't
[02:00.260 --> 02:02.260]  Yeah, you don't listen to a lot of podcasts though. Oh
[02:02.780 --> 02:07.800]  I mean, I don't listen to a lot, but I wasn't to enough but when I do I'm listening with earbuds
[02:07.820 --> 02:11.860]  So I you know, I don't think and a lot of times I would say
[02:11.860 --> 02:13.860]  easily
[02:16.260 --> 02:22.000]  85% of the time I'm listening to podcasts. I'm walking through the city. So there's so much noise
[02:22.840 --> 02:25.500]  You know, it's it's the quality of the mic
[02:25.500 --> 02:31.220]  I mean, you know, I I understand why people make it sound as good as they can but I could never hear the difference between
[02:32.580 --> 02:36.420]  Microphones did you uh, never get your driver's license back? I
[02:37.940 --> 02:39.940]  Didn't lose my driver's license today
[02:39.940 --> 02:45.780]  You probably don't remember it was on an episode of the talk show with Dan and you had the holiday party
[02:47.660 --> 02:50.100]  It's my favorite episode of the talk show and
[02:51.140 --> 02:55.820]  How they took your license away, you don't remember you probably don't remember that it was the holiday season. It's a lot to remember
[02:56.140 --> 03:00.580]  Yeah, I don't remember why they take my license away. Oh, I made it up
[03:00.580 --> 03:05.060]  I remember oh god now I remember
[03:05.940 --> 03:11.180]  Because you had so many points, right? I mean you refused to go to traffic school and Dan, you know the dance credit
[03:11.180 --> 03:16.420]  He played the entire episode straight. Yeah, really funny. Oh, that was a good that was HR HR
[03:17.060 --> 03:20.060]  Fluffy Puff. Yeah, and I got I
[03:20.700 --> 03:23.100]  Should write that down for the show notes. I got I
[03:23.100 --> 03:29.660]  Think most people got it, but I definitely got a fair amount of email from listeners who were telling me. Hey, you know
[03:31.260 --> 03:33.260]  Maybe you ought to get some help
[03:33.900 --> 03:38.560]  So, you know, that's not funny. It's not funny racking up all those points, you know
[03:41.020 --> 03:43.580]  Well that there was there they're like, you know, you're gonna learn
[03:44.100 --> 03:47.860]  When you hit a kid, you know crossing the street, right? Thanks, John. You got a kid
[03:48.540 --> 03:52.040]  Jesus Christ, you know, I I'm so tired of words
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.600]  I'm just gonna stop saying things. It's just I I give up I give up
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.360]  I'm just gonna make grunts and maybe like like sing a little humble little tune, but you know
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.320]  No matter what you say
[04:01.320 --> 04:05.840]  I mean a crack last night on the Twitter about how I wish Netflix in
[04:06.200 --> 04:12.200]  Streaming five seasons of mash the five good seasons of mash how I wish they would have it without the left track
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.720]  Mmm, oh my god
[04:13.720 --> 04:20.000]  I got so many responses from people on the one hand telling me how that's physically impossible since it's hard-coded
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.240]  and
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.280]  Then other people going sir. Did you know that you're good or the DVD tracks? I was like, yeah, you know what?
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.960]  I know all of that. I know all of that. I was just making a joke. It's it's just it's an ephemeral comment
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.600]  It's it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine. You must get that like to the 10th power, especially like when you're being jokey about
[04:37.520 --> 04:40.720]  Whatever sports. Yeah technology you must you must get so many
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.440]  Whackadoodle responses from people. Yeah
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.100]  It goes and flows I can never predict though
[04:46.100 --> 04:50.920]  Like I'll post some kind of you know, absurd tweet and I think oh god
[04:50.920 --> 04:56.080]  I'm gonna get so many people who take this seriously and then there's nothing and then I throw one out that I'm not even worried about
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.640]  And everybody, you know, John there is absolutely no way to know
[05:00.640 --> 05:07.080]  I make I make a lot of news related your mother jokes and every time I expect incredible blowback
[05:07.600 --> 05:14.320]  Nothing, that's fine. That's awesome. I make one crack about mash having a laugh track and like the entire peanut gallery rises as one
[05:14.320 --> 05:16.120]  But you know
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.120]  It's it's good. I'm just tired of words
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.360]  What was the deal with mash his laugh track the way I recall it is season one
[05:22.360 --> 05:25.840]  There was no laugh track and it was a ratings
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.580]  it was it was
[05:27.580 --> 05:33.520]  precipitous that it was like the ratings were so bad that it was on the border of not coming back for another season and that
[05:33.520 --> 05:38.320]  They one of the one of the changes they made between season one season two was they added a laugh track
[05:39.120 --> 05:41.120]  Yeah, I don't I remember
[05:41.120 --> 05:47.440]  Having read because you know, it most people who enjoy the mass show. It's a pretty hot topic
[05:48.400 --> 05:54.520]  Because you can on the DVDs. I don't own the DVDs. I hate DVDs. I hate physical media. I don't want them in my house
[05:54.520 --> 05:56.720]  I mean, that's me. That's my quarter of last resort
[05:56.720 --> 06:01.720]  Like I've got I've got all the James Bond films like everybody, you know, I bought about that hundred dollar blu-ray package
[06:01.720 --> 06:07.080]  I got that I got the Godfather and then I think I got a Dora or something like that, but that's about it
[06:07.080 --> 06:12.840]  And but yeah, they had an alternate track where you could have the audio without the laugh track
[06:12.840 --> 06:19.880]  I don't remember exactly how it happened except I mean think about the time. What is that? 72 73 something like that where every
[06:21.080 --> 06:27.860]  Every like three camera sitcom had a live audience. Like you got your all in the families and stuff and I think you know
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.960]  It probably seemed a little dead to people and some of the humor is prob was probably a little bit dry
[06:33.960 --> 06:40.600]  It's just it suddenly became not very dry when there's a very obvious laugh on it. I just I really hate laugh tracks
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.240]  No, they just they drive me crazy and you can actually go and you know
[06:44.240 --> 06:45.800]  If you know where to go, I know you don't do these things
[06:45.800 --> 06:51.920]  But you can find copies of it and it is actually a pretty different experience. You go watch my favorite episode
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.060]  Abyssinia Henry the one where Henry leaves you remember that episode
[06:57.320 --> 06:59.320]  It's the end of season three
[06:59.320 --> 07:06.160]  I'm sure I'm sure he dies. He gets shot out of the air and it's the episode right before trap trapper leaves
[07:06.160 --> 07:09.880]  It was the end of the season and it's got that amazing scene at the end where?
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.640]  Radar walks into the operating room and and reads the notice that Henry's dead
[07:14.840 --> 07:22.000]  it's incredibly moving and watching that episode without the laugh track is a real different thing because it's one of the great episodes of TV and
[07:22.520 --> 07:28.160]  You know, you know, it's good maybe in a way that people at that time wouldn't know. It's good. So it feels a little
[07:28.160 --> 07:31.280]  Insulting, you know to have to put all of that on
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.680]  It's not super loud like on some shows like 90 shows where the left track got so loud
[07:35.680 --> 07:36.360]  But yeah
[07:36.360 --> 07:43.320]  But it always felt to me even as a kid and and growing up in an era when all sitcoms had
[07:43.920 --> 07:50.520]  Laugh tracks or as live studio audience and even the ones at live studio audience, you know that they the laughter pretty loud sometimes
[07:50.520 --> 07:51.960]  Yeah
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.960]  It always seemed incongruous because it clearly was not shot in front of the live studio audience
[07:56.960 --> 08:00.280]  It was shot on real, you know, like a soundstage. Yeah
[08:01.880 --> 08:04.640]  You know like, you know in the case of mash it's like they're shooting it outdoors
[08:04.640 --> 08:10.280]  There's not people on bleachers there, right and the production values were always such I mean clearly in hindsight
[08:10.280 --> 08:13.720]  I mean everybody knew it was a smash hit eventually it became a smash hit, you know
[08:13.720 --> 08:15.720]  after a couple seasons and it was you know, like
[08:17.440 --> 08:21.240]  It was always like I think it was always like number one or number two was 60 minutes, you know
[08:21.240 --> 08:25.400]  It was always like a fight which was gonna be the top-rated show of the week and minutes man
[08:25.400 --> 08:30.800]  That was a juggernaut. Remember that was just like almost always it was it was 60 minutes or something else for a little while
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.520]  It was always 60 minutes. Yeah, it was always number one or number two
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.360]  It felt like your civic obligation as an American was some Sunday night at 7
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.400]  Yeah, everybody, you know from 7 to 70 would sit down and watch 60 minutes. Mm-hmm
[08:42.440 --> 08:46.320]  Yeah, and the other thing that's funny about mash is and this is you know
[08:47.040 --> 08:50.960]  It sounds nasty. I don't mean it to be but it's funny the that you know
[08:50.960 --> 08:57.520]  Like three of the stars of that show left because they wanted a better deal or they wanted more attention
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.920]  You know Wayne Rogers as Trapper McLean Stevenson, you know
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.940]  He was done with it and later on Larry Linville had decided he was done with the Frank Burns character and you know
[09:07.560 --> 09:11.560]  None of them ever found anything approaching that again. It's it's such a bummer. Oh
[09:12.400 --> 09:15.560]  Who's the guy who replaced Frank Burns Winchester, right?
[09:15.560 --> 09:19.680]  Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, he was yeah, and he was there was tough
[09:19.680 --> 09:24.860]  It was a tough one cuz what you could tell Winchester was actually a good surgeon. Yes. We knew Frank was uh, you know
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.740]  Yeah, it was a good show it was good yeah, you're it is interesting it's interesting in so many ways
[09:33.740 --> 09:38.880]  It was a good movie that started it and then they you know didn't have any of the character
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.880]  You know any of the same actors from the movie?
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.880]  Come had Gary Burghoff was from in the movie Oh radar radar
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.160]  Yeah, and the first season is much closer in the kind of anarchic spirit
[09:52.160 --> 09:57.720]  Yeah much closer to the first to the film. But yeah, it got you know, like anything though
[09:57.720 --> 10:01.120]  I think they kind of they started, you know, this great thing. There was a great episode
[10:01.640 --> 10:06.400]  Where Hawkeye writes to his dad there's an episode called dear dad. I remember that one. I remember it was really good
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.360]  It's from like I don't know for a second season and but then they did like remember then they had like
[10:10.360 --> 10:13.160]  Dear peg and then they had dear
[10:14.120 --> 10:16.120]  father mokay, he writes and eventually
[10:17.800 --> 10:24.120]  Alan Arbus remember the psychiatrist he's writing to Sigmund Freud at some point like like an open letter or something
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.460]  He got really bananas, but it was a good show
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.280]  I mean it was it was really of its time
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.040]  But by the end it was just it was so insufferable even as a flaming liberal. I can't watch that show
[10:33.040 --> 10:37.200]  It's it's such a pantomime of you know politics. I haven't seen it in a long time
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.720]  I don't remember it it petering out at toward the end. And I remember the last episode was oh man
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.840]  I was a tobacco with the chicken. Oh, I just and Hawkeye still haunts me still haunts me committed or something
[10:48.840 --> 10:53.400]  And yeah, cuz the chicken chicken, I don't know. I was always obsessed
[10:53.400 --> 10:57.280]  that's another like lifelong obsession obsession for me and like a minor one is
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.040]  Final episodes of shows I'll watch the last episode of a show that I've never even watched just to see how they you know
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.680]  I like a last episode
[11:04.680 --> 11:10.420]  Yeah, and I I watched mash. I you know, I watched it. I watched the reruns, you know
[11:10.420 --> 11:15.940]  It was a staple in our household like flipping through the stations like waiting for dinner to be ready
[11:16.320 --> 11:21.680]  Everybody could agree we'd watch mash, you know, and the reruns were you know, like 530 or something like that. So it was
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.880]  You know and the reruns were still were on while the show was still wrapping up I think and absolutely
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.520]  Yeah, and I think their last episode
[11:30.520 --> 11:37.400]  For a long time was the highest rated like non Super Bowl type. Yeah, definitely was. Oh, yeah
[11:37.680 --> 11:40.980]  Yeah, it was like a national event and everybody was like what the hell was that?
[11:43.640 --> 11:51.240]  Kind of went on yeah, how does it play now like watching any of those episodes with Jamie far's character?
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.400]  What was his name?
[11:54.400 --> 12:01.760]  clinger clinger clinger, how could I forget that so clear for anybody who isn't familiar clinger was played by Jamie far and he
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.800]  Did not want to serve in the army. This is
[12:06.360 --> 12:12.800]  Drafted he was drafted with these kids and he knew that there was something that you could get if you were mentally unsound to serve
[12:12.800 --> 12:18.640]  In the army, you could get a dis get a section 8 or something section 8. So he's always angling for a section 8
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.640]  So, how do you convince the army that you're crazy?
[12:21.160 --> 12:23.360]  You dress like Carmen Miranda women's clothes
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.560]  all right, so he wore a woman's women's clothing all the time and
[12:28.440 --> 12:34.600]  You know, it didn't work. Everybody knew what his stick was, but he never let up on it. So he still he still did his job
[12:34.600 --> 12:37.960]  That's right. He showed up dressed like a nurse, but then he was a pretty good nurse
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.040]  That's part of the problem you got I think you should undermine the basic task that you're doing or do them in it's such a bananas
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.520]  Way that it's clear that you're crazy. You know what I'm saying, right?
[12:47.520 --> 12:53.640]  You know, it's it's okay I think the earlier seasons are better, you know, it's so funny with TV shows
[12:53.640 --> 12:58.040]  It always takes them a few episodes or a season to find their legs and then you know
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.960]  Things kind of seem to go for a while. I can't imagine doing a TV show. It just seems so exhausting
[13:02.960 --> 13:06.540]  Oh totally of any kind. Yeah, whether it's you know, like
[13:08.440 --> 13:16.240]  Like like well like the this very day like yes last night was as we record yesterday was the day John Stewart announced it
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.120]  he was going to
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.200]  Step down from The Daily Show and then it's like he said something during the show. Did you watch I watch and it was like
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.000]  No, what'd you say?
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.360]  I think he said he's been doing it for 17 years and I looked at I was watching with Amy and I was like well that
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.840]  Can't be and then I was like thinking about I was like, holy shit
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.440]  And I know and then I'm like, well, of course, he's gonna step down
[13:34.440 --> 13:37.080]  He's been doing this show four days a week for 17 years
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.480]  Yeah, and I know I mean talking to in particular Hodgeman and Rob Corddry about it people
[13:43.480 --> 13:46.200]  I know who've been on that show and work with him all say the same thing
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.560]  Which is that the first of all, he's a very nice guy and you know
[13:50.120 --> 13:56.080]  He's a good guy. But also that he is one of the hard. He's he's the hardest working person in the building
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.680]  So when Hajme won't go on there, he would have like kind of a prepared bit and then I mean, you know
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.680]  He's I don't think he was the showrunner, but he he was involved in like every rewrite up until camp
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.440]  I mean like he was making everybody in the room better on every episode
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.520]  Can you imagine doing that for over 15 years like what that would take out of you?
[14:13.520 --> 14:13.840]  No
[14:13.840 --> 14:17.920]  And I think that I have trouble ordering groceries and and this guy is doing that every single night
[14:18.480 --> 14:19.880]  I
[14:19.880 --> 14:24.000]  think it's very clear to that he you know, and
[14:25.680 --> 14:31.480]  It put it in sports ball terms, he's a good he was like a good passer in basketball like he was not concerned
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.920]  Obviously, he's the host of the show. He's you know, the one who does the whole first half single-handedly on on air at least
[14:37.920 --> 14:39.920]  Obviously with the help of writers
[14:40.020 --> 14:45.980]  but as soon as anybody else is on whether it's a bit at the desk like a Hodgman thing or
[14:46.500 --> 14:49.020]  anything else it's he is so a
[14:49.580 --> 14:55.620]  hundred percent concentrated on making that other person look as good as they possibly can and make sure that
[14:55.780 --> 14:59.980]  They get as many of the laughs as they possibly can. I totally agree
[14:59.980 --> 15:03.920]  And I mean you can look to our hero and it's like the paragon of that. I mean
[15:03.920 --> 15:11.120]  Carson was so good whoever that was like whether that was Burt Reynolds or whether that was
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.040]  Some grandmother that had done something crazy. He was so generous
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.640]  I mean, I think even if he wasn't loving I think Fred de Cordova would be the one who kind of stepped in and go
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.600]  Okay, we're ready to go to commercial Carson was sometimes, you know, give him the hand signal
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.680]  But but he was I mean he was there and fully
[15:27.960 --> 15:32.720]  Committed to whatever was happening and wanted to make that person look good and it made everybody look good
[15:32.720 --> 15:39.480]  Yeah, exactly. All right, so I I was surprised I have to say like just two bits about the whole late-night shuffling
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.640]  I was a little surprised when Letterman announced his
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.920]  Retirement that Jon Stewart didn't get that or maybe he didn't want it
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.040]  I you know, you know if he if he was thinking about stepping down from this
[15:52.640 --> 15:56.740]  You know on a daily basis, maybe that's just that he didn't want to you know
[15:56.740 --> 16:00.320]  He just didn't want to do a daily show anymore. I always thought that the Jon Stewart would be an
[16:00.320 --> 16:02.280]  excellent
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.380]  You know like Letterman style show host
[16:06.120 --> 16:11.640]  Yeah. Yeah, I agree. And you know, it's funny to think about like what the world was like when Letterman started and
[16:12.280 --> 16:14.640]  It would be impossible to explain to somebody today
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.360]  Probably in the same way that Steve Allen like to us Steve Allen seems like an old guy, but Steve Allen's show
[16:21.360 --> 16:26.660]  Broke the mold. I mean, there'd never been anybody on TV quite like Steve Allen who was so kind of you know
[16:26.660 --> 16:34.180]  Cultural and and witty and smart but also so would do such crazy stunts and that had a huge influence on Letterman
[16:34.620 --> 16:39.220]  And then Letterman comes along and you know, they had that crazy deal with Carson, you know about all this right?
[16:39.220 --> 16:44.620]  Like there was they had a very they had a guy from Carson's production team there
[16:44.940 --> 16:49.660]  Who basically made sure that he's like, okay. Here's your show. Here's the rules like you can't book anybody
[16:50.060 --> 16:55.380]  Who's like one of Johnny's regulars, you know, Johnny gets the first bite of any of these particular apples
[16:55.380 --> 16:56.660]  There's all kinds of rules
[16:56.660 --> 17:02.500]  But that was a constraint that he worked and brought in Larry Budd Millman or he brought in Chris Elliott and that made the show
[17:02.820 --> 17:09.460]  So much more fun and so much weirder than if that awkward young David Letterman was trying to interview, you know Madonna
[17:09.460 --> 17:16.180]  Yeah, I think most famously there were restrictions on the length of the monologue. And so oh because that's Johnny's thing
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.340]  Yeah, it was Johnny's thing
[17:17.340 --> 17:19.540]  and so like on the old Letterman show
[17:19.540 --> 17:27.420]  Letterman would come out and do three jokes and they were so perfunctory like the the bit was almost like his complete disdain for
[17:27.420 --> 17:29.820]  The monologue he would just come out and do three
[17:30.540 --> 17:35.660]  Really clipped perfunctory jokes and then it was on to the desk and the rest
[17:35.660 --> 17:41.100]  And you know the part that made it the part that made it funny every night was how terrible he made it seem like he
[17:41.100 --> 17:46.500]  Thought it was like that was a terrible joke and him adjusting his tie and like the kind of face, you know
[17:46.500 --> 17:51.860]  Yeah, that's what made it funny, right? So like they took the restrictions from Carson productions on the monologue and
[17:52.260 --> 17:56.420]  And I think eventually like I think once it settled in and it was very clear
[17:56.420 --> 18:02.720]  I didn't I don't think it took long for Carson and his people to realize that Letterman was no threat to Carson
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.500]  Like there was no way that that Letterman was ever going to steal his job, right?
[18:08.500 --> 18:11.940]  Right, like it's just not that type of person and you know, he was fine
[18:11.940 --> 18:17.020]  You know, I think you know famously he wanted it and when when the time came in when Johnny retired
[18:17.180 --> 18:21.200]  But he was never going to backstab him if his ratings had you know
[18:21.460 --> 18:24.900]  If I never seen he's never seen anything like completely grateful
[18:24.900 --> 18:29.300]  Like when he tells the story and I guess the first time he was on and got called over to the couch
[18:29.420 --> 18:35.180]  Like he honestly he still sounds like a kid like what what a moving moment that was for him to get to do that
[18:35.180 --> 18:40.540]  Yeah, so I think that eventually I don't think it took long where if if he had wanted to do longer monologues
[18:40.540 --> 18:44.820]  I don't really think that the phone was gonna ring and the Carson people were gonna say hey, you know
[18:44.820 --> 18:48.780]  You were you know, you know, you're only supposed to do two minutes a monologue and you did 230 last night
[18:48.820 --> 18:51.020]  But I think that they just embraced to that
[18:51.820 --> 18:55.420]  Anti monologue, you know that that just became part of the signature of the show
[18:55.420 --> 18:57.420]  Oh, yeah, and I mean that's a beat it to death
[18:57.420 --> 19:03.460]  but I think about the stuff that I remember when I would hear somebody was gonna be on I would get so excited and
[19:03.860 --> 19:09.260]  Certainly, there's famous scenes where like Drew Barrymore acted all crazy or Crispin Glover was all you know
[19:09.260 --> 19:11.380]  Nuts that one time I tried to do but like it's gonna kick him
[19:11.380 --> 19:14.820]  Those are famous but what do you really remember from the first three years?
[19:14.820 --> 19:19.380]  I mean you you remember people like Harvey P car you remember people like Charles Grodin
[19:19.380 --> 19:23.180]  I remember you remember people being on there who or like
[19:23.940 --> 19:29.780]  Jeff Jeff Altman, I love Jeff Altman like he would be so very 20-pound butt steak, you know
[19:30.700 --> 19:31.820]  and
[19:31.820 --> 19:35.740]  That's what made the show and then like the prancing fluids and all that stuff
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.100]  That was the product of that privation like is what made the show good
[19:40.100 --> 19:43.600]  It would not have lasted as long if it had been just another show Harvey P car
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.100]  I haven't thought about him in maybe 20 years. So Charles Grodin it was a bit
[19:48.140 --> 19:51.380]  Yeah, whenever Charles Grodin was on Carson or lettering you got that
[19:51.380 --> 19:56.020]  It was kind of a bit but Harvey P car genuinely seemed to hate Dave and hate the idea of being on the show
[19:56.700 --> 20:02.140]  Right and was just a miserable person quite frankly. It was not very attractive either
[20:02.140 --> 20:07.940]  So it wasn't really like, you know people like looking at him. And so I think any normal talk show would be like
[20:07.940 --> 20:12.180]  I don't know who booked him, but they're fired and make sure we never have him back again
[20:12.180 --> 20:17.660]  Where's the letterman people like let's have this guy back on every couple months. Oh, absolutely and it was true for I mean
[20:17.660 --> 20:21.900]  I think Jeff Altman is you know, one of his great repeat guests
[20:21.900 --> 20:25.260]  I mean he would he loved having Jeff Altman on partly because I think I
[20:25.420 --> 20:27.580]  You know, I have to tell you if you don't already know about this
[20:27.580 --> 20:33.580]  I'm cribbing some of this from a podcast. Have you heard the podcast the Carson podcast? No, you should know about this
[20:33.580 --> 20:35.920]  There's a show this guy in LA does this comedian in LA?
[20:35.920 --> 20:39.340]  I think it's called the Carson podcast and the whole podcast is him
[20:39.540 --> 20:45.580]  Interviewing people who have some kind of an interesting relationship with the Carson show. No show. Yeah, it was great
[20:45.580 --> 20:49.900]  So people like Jeff Altman people like, you know, Bob Einstein, you know super Dave
[20:49.940 --> 20:56.580]  Yeah, like just all kinds of people and then and then like George Carlin's daughter was on but it's it's a great insight into
[20:56.580 --> 21:03.140]  What you and I know which is like what an inscrutable person he was. Everybody says the same thing. It was great
[21:03.140 --> 21:09.140]  It was the greatest honor you ever have but nobody is like two or three people who ever felt like they legitimately knew Johnny Carson
[21:09.140 --> 21:12.700]  Yeah, did you read the biography? That is no I saw that we talked about that
[21:12.700 --> 21:18.060]  I think one time we talked about that PBS show. Oh, that was great the PBS Masters episode. Oh, that was terrific
[21:18.820 --> 21:24.180]  That was the best thing and and they didn't really try to get to the person, you know
[21:24.180 --> 21:26.460]  I mean they acknowledged it and they talked to so many
[21:27.860 --> 21:32.600]  So many people it was such a great thing the PBS Masters thing, but it was kind of like
[21:33.300 --> 21:38.140]  Almost like Citizen Kane where everybody like knew of you know had the same regard for this purse
[21:38.140 --> 21:43.720]  But never really felt like they knew what made him tick, you know, and so anyway, you might check out that podcast. It's
[21:44.500 --> 21:47.340]  It's pretty good. The book I forget is
[21:48.180 --> 21:49.940]  Henry something
[21:49.940 --> 21:52.000]  Let me look it up here Carson biography
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.600]  Carson by
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.320]  Henry
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.080]  Let's see. Sounds like he'd you know, he'd wrap the show. He Henry Bushkin
[21:59.760 --> 22:01.080]  Okay, there we go
[22:01.080 --> 22:03.400]  And it's not like he would never talk before the show
[22:03.480 --> 22:07.240]  There would be just a little bit right and was just nobody he would not talk to the guests
[22:07.240 --> 22:09.720]  I mean he would get in the car and drive away and that was it. Yeah
[22:13.400 --> 22:14.800]  The
[22:14.800 --> 22:18.800]  Henry Bushkin book is uncomfortable to me because clearly it's a betrayal of
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.720]  Of trust like there's no way he should be telling the story. I mean, it's unauthorized. Oh, yeah, definitely
[22:25.040 --> 22:27.440]  It's you know, I mean, how could it be authorized?
[22:27.440 --> 22:28.720]  I mean Carson's dead, but I mean
[22:28.720 --> 22:32.020]  I don't think his family would have wanted it and I think if you had asked Johnny while he was alive
[22:32.320 --> 22:38.400]  Would you like Henry Bushkin to you know, write a book about certainly not right, but on the other hand he did write it
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.100]  So I read it, you know, but I kind of felt I did I felt a little icky the whole time
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.760]  but there's some crazy stories in there and there's one story where I
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.320]  I
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.720]  Forget if it was his wife or it was just a girlfriend
[22:50.720 --> 22:54.840]  But I think I might have been his wife and he Johnny thought is one of his you know earlier wives
[22:54.840 --> 22:57.000]  This is when the show was still in New York and he lived in New York
[22:57.560 --> 23:01.840]  He figured out his wife was running around on him and he wanted to break into the
[23:02.920 --> 23:06.940]  Apartment it was her apartment, but he was paying for it. So he said it so it's got to be Lee
[23:06.940 --> 23:08.200]  I'm paying for it. So it's legal
[23:08.200 --> 23:15.240]  we're breaking in and he got Henry but his took his lawyer with him and like two guys who could only really be described as
[23:15.240 --> 23:16.560]  toughs
[23:16.560 --> 23:22.760]  thugs, yeah, and like and Henry Bushkin says in the book that the one guy even had a gun tucked in his belt and
[23:23.440 --> 23:28.520]  They go over there and like break into the place and find, you know find evidence that she was running around on him
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.840]  But you know, it's like stories that you know, you you don't expect your lawyer to write a book about that
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.520]  That's why you take your look. It's his lawyer that wrote the book. Yeah, it's his law. Oh my god
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.360]  That's that's not cricket man
[23:43.360 --> 23:48.940]  No, it's a good read. It's a good quick read, but it's I'm requesting from the library right now
[23:48.940 --> 23:51.580]  Yeah, this is a guy, you know who needed some money, I think
[23:52.460 --> 23:53.580]  sure
[23:53.580 --> 23:57.160]  But he was you know, but he but I guess the thing I would that made me think about it is that
[23:57.860 --> 24:03.160]  He was obvious. He was more than just his lawyer though. He became as close a friend as anybody could to him
[24:03.160 --> 24:05.460]  They played tennis together. They were both tennis nuts
[24:06.140 --> 24:12.300]  And they used to travel to I remember that Johnny did this because I remember I used to watch tennis on TV sometimes
[24:12.300 --> 24:16.420]  but Johnny would always like for years had an annual trip where he would go to Wimbledon and
[24:16.740 --> 24:18.900]  Henry Bushkin and his wife went with him
[24:18.900 --> 24:24.260]  It was like Johnny and his wife and his Henry Bushkin and his wife every year for like 15 years
[24:24.260 --> 24:26.620]  They went to England for like two or three weeks
[24:27.460 --> 24:32.220]  So I mean they were definitely close but even then even being that close that you vacationed with Johnny Carson
[24:32.620 --> 24:37.020]  For a couple of weeks every year. It's like he still clearly didn't really know him that well
[24:37.020 --> 24:42.940]  Yeah, totally. I think Pat McCormick the comic Pat McCormick who I think had worked on the show and was on a lot also
[24:42.940 --> 24:46.780]  Was another one but even in interviews, I think Pat McCormick I think was on that podcast
[24:47.020 --> 24:51.620]  But it's a lot like when you hear people talk about Sinatra, you know where they're all talking about mr
[24:51.620 --> 24:55.380]  Sinatra and like this deference like he'll come back from the grave and get you whacked like this
[24:55.380 --> 25:02.060]  There's still a lot of deference to Johnny and a desire to keep his legacy, you know clean to the extent possible
[25:02.340 --> 25:06.340]  Yeah, I almost feel I mean, you know not having ever seen the guy in person
[25:06.340 --> 25:11.160]  But my impression is maybe that like he just had was like a one in a one in a billion
[25:12.660 --> 25:19.860]  Freak where the real Johnny Carson was the one who was on for 60 minutes in front of a camera sitting at a desk like
[25:19.860 --> 25:23.900]  that really was him and that it was the other 23 hours of his life where
[25:24.420 --> 25:29.020]  There was it was just nothing. Oh, yeah. I mean, he's like he's like a comic book character, right?
[25:29.020 --> 25:33.660]  I mean, you know where it's almost like Bruce Wayne is the secret. I you know what I mean?
[25:33.660 --> 25:37.820]  It's like Batman is the real guy in some ways and breathing is that yeah, exactly, right?
[25:37.820 --> 25:40.740]  and I feel like that might have been Johnny Carson and I feel like
[25:41.220 --> 25:46.340]  You know, that's what made him so inscrutable and off, you know off-camera. Yeah
[25:47.900 --> 25:52.880]  Let's take a break I'll take a break and I'm gonna tell you about a sponsor. I'm very excited about this sponsor

[28:05.040 --> 28:07.040]  That's a lot of percent. Yeah
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.520]  So go check them out. It's really cool. Very and very very beautiful. It's a great website really really cool
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.240]  I'm really proud of that guy and envious and I kind of hate him a little bit
[28:17.160 --> 28:19.940]  Our friend Matt Alexander. Yeah, what he's what he's doing is
[28:19.940 --> 28:21.260]  amazing
[28:21.260 --> 28:25.660]  Like what he's done in such a short period of time is I think he's about 14 years old
[28:26.100 --> 28:27.740]  And he's half English
[28:27.740 --> 28:31.700]  So he's gotten past that and it's it's still astonishing to me
[28:31.700 --> 28:34.940]  Like what that guy has managed to do that, you know
[28:34.940 --> 28:39.260]  He when he's first described these projects to me and it just seems like there's more and more coming out all the time
[28:39.680 --> 28:42.100]  You know, I was like, well, that's you know, it's kind of cool
[28:42.100 --> 28:49.020]  It kind of sounds like a store like a small store, but it's been a big hit. It's it's really frustrating
[28:49.020 --> 28:55.060]  Yeah, and don't you wish you could do something like that? I do I do because I feel like I
[28:56.380 --> 28:58.500]  Don't know. I like it cuz it's real
[28:58.500 --> 29:04.980]  I feel I the things that impress me is people come up with new ideas for businesses and and you know, I
[29:06.100 --> 29:10.900]  Like the ones to have something that you can touch the like where you got to buy a buy film for your virtual camera
[29:10.900 --> 29:17.960]  I think it drives you nuts though, right? Like that's not really that's not really a company
[29:17.960 --> 29:25.060]  I would say I would to actually say that the spectrum of the things that I tend to be most interested in are on the one
[29:25.060 --> 29:27.060]  side are real physical things like
[29:27.900 --> 29:33.180]  Somebody who's making iPhone docks out of blocks of wood, right? I mean not all of them
[29:33.180 --> 29:35.460]  I don't like them all but I mean, you know
[29:36.300 --> 29:40.780]  Something like that where you're making a real thing and you're doing it real way and then the ones I like least would have
[29:40.780 --> 29:42.780]  to be the virtual fake
[29:43.100 --> 29:45.260]  real world constraints, you know the
[29:46.460 --> 29:49.580]  some of the some of the kinds of services that are out there are
[29:50.700 --> 29:57.700]  So weird as I get more and more cynical about everything and a little bit more frisky about things like privacy
[29:57.700 --> 30:02.260]  Like I you just see stuff coming down the lane. You're like really like that's there's this thing
[30:02.260 --> 30:07.300]  You remember every block remember? Did you get that? Sure. That was Steven Johnson and Wilson
[30:07.300 --> 30:12.560]  I think Wilson minor worked on that but it was a really amazing service super clean beautiful website
[30:12.660 --> 30:17.980]  That would basically aggregate all kinds of mostly public information about things like police activity
[30:18.540 --> 30:26.340]  Safety, I mean anything that you you couldn't care less for any neighborhood except your own but in your neighborhood you really care and it's incredible
[30:26.340 --> 30:29.940]  Like I went in and I saw one time I called the cops about something and I could find that on the website
[30:29.940 --> 30:31.420]  It was really really cool
[30:31.420 --> 30:37.500]  But I think they contracted to be in only a few contracted as in like kind of sucked down to be just in a few cities
[30:37.660 --> 30:44.640]  Now these other ones cropping up my wife got me to get on this one in our neighborhood. It's just it's it's so annoying
[30:44.900 --> 30:49.500]  It's one of those things where you you sign up and you got to like give them tons of information
[30:49.500 --> 30:50.340]  They want your phone number
[30:50.340 --> 30:53.880]  They want to send a postcard to your house to verify that you you're you fine
[30:53.880 --> 31:01.020]  And then they automatically put your address on the website and then every page you're on there are call to actions and pop-ups
[31:01.020 --> 31:06.380]  Telling you to go invite more people it asks you to like, you know, bring in all of your on the one hand
[31:06.380 --> 31:08.180]  They're real careful about making sure who you are
[31:08.180 --> 31:12.860]  but then it's one of those remember like path kind of thing where they're like now don't you want it and start and bring in all
[31:12.860 --> 31:14.980]  of your contacts and your Facebook people and it's like I
[31:15.780 --> 31:22.220]  Am increasingly super uncomfortable with that as a business model. It's gross as soon as they asked me for it
[31:22.220 --> 31:26.380]  I had just closed the window. I immediately think well, that's your business model and then I'm grossed out
[31:26.980 --> 31:30.120]  Yeah, yeah, and I mean there's some kinds of things like say what you will about Google
[31:30.120 --> 31:34.420]  I mean like opening that Google app, especially like when I'm out of town. I was out of town last week
[31:34.420 --> 31:37.300]  It still kind of blows my mind how smart Google is
[31:37.300 --> 31:42.940]  I know they're Google but but like they if there's anybody out there who is providing some value for the nonsense
[31:42.940 --> 31:46.480]  They do you got to give them credit like here's the city you're traveling to there's the temperature
[31:46.480 --> 31:50.660]  Hey, here's your flight that just came in via this by email like that kind of stuff
[31:50.780 --> 31:55.460]  You know, I wish they were better with the privacy stuff in some ways, but that's a real value
[31:55.460 --> 31:58.460]  They've done something very innovative to be able to do that at scale
[31:58.460 --> 32:02.560]  But you can just feel on some of these websites where you just tell that they're young
[32:02.560 --> 32:05.980]  it's a new company and it's all about building the user base and
[32:06.740 --> 32:09.920]  Then leveraging as much personal information as possible
[32:09.920 --> 32:14.980]  I don't know. It's kind of a boring thing to get into but I find that I find that really kind of gross and frustrating
[32:14.980 --> 32:19.520]  I feel like enough of my stuff is out there. I don't I don't need to go sign up for free services
[32:19.520 --> 32:21.520]  That are gonna do that
[32:21.640 --> 32:23.640]  Did you see?
[32:23.640 --> 32:28.640]  There was an article I forget the guy's name a couple of weeks ago on
[32:32.640 --> 32:38.180]  On Google the the the trade-off between if you if you give Google
[32:38.700 --> 32:44.260]  Everything they want to know about you and buy into their stuff you get a tremendous
[32:44.880 --> 32:50.640]  Experience out of it. Like if you've got an Android phone and you use the whole ecosystem and the apps
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.620]  Right that kind of thing right like, you know, and like you said like and it definitely works
[32:55.620 --> 32:59.100]  I mean, I don't buy into this. It's certainly come a long way, right?
[33:02.180 --> 33:06.300]  But it's cool stuff like if you're using Gmail and you let you know
[33:06.300 --> 33:12.500]  then then you get your flight stuff into your Gmail and then they already know you have a flight because they've already parsed the
[33:12.500 --> 33:18.800]  Email from your airline that says you're doing it and then your today view already has like you said has the weather for
[33:18.800 --> 33:23.900]  San Francisco because that's where I'm flying right or like I just got a pop-up yesterday
[33:23.900 --> 33:27.480]  It's like this shirt that you ordered for a short order for my kid. They're like it just shipped
[33:27.480 --> 33:29.560]  Here's the FedEx number like that's actually pretty useful
[33:31.360 --> 33:37.040]  Yeah, that's pretty awesome so I mean but it's it it's like you said though like I'm
[33:38.020 --> 33:39.900]  You know a little
[33:39.900 --> 33:46.760]  Wary of it, but at least with Google you the exchange is very clear. It's okay
[33:46.760 --> 33:51.000]  you're gonna give up some of your privacy and they're going to they're gonna send you targeted ads and
[33:51.680 --> 33:56.400]  That makes me a little uncomfortable. But in exchange there's there's a very clear value proposition though
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.560]  it's you know, we know so, you know, we're gonna give you stuff that you need to know like your weather and
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.260]  Reminders of things that you didn't even ask to be reminded of but that you would need to
[34:06.440 --> 34:09.480]  And I think that's pretty interesting. Whereas with a lot of these startups
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.120]  It's like they want the information and you know, they're gonna sell it out and it's like I have no idea
[34:14.120 --> 34:18.440]  You know, why would I why would I give this to you? Right, right, right, right. Yeah, absolutely
[34:18.440 --> 34:23.160]  And yeah, anyway, it's probably kind of a thistle to get into but you know, then you look at something like uber
[34:23.880 --> 34:26.960]  Where did you see the thing where they're lost and found?
[34:27.880 --> 34:34.640]  Database was like an unprotected spreadsheet on the internet with people's names and phone numbers in it. No, I did not it's like wow
[34:34.640 --> 34:36.640]  That's that's pretty rough
[34:38.540 --> 34:40.720]  The sharing economy thing is is
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.760]  Super interesting to me because I I'm kind of surprised really especially in San Francisco
[34:45.760 --> 34:49.560]  I am very surprised this stuff has gotten as far as it has, you know, you asked me ten years ago
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.040]  I mean I live in a neighborhood where it's very difficult to get a cab anytime and
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.680]  I've cursed the cab companies forever because they don't give a fig they don't need to they can just drive
[34:57.680 --> 35:01.520]  You know up and down Polk Street and make all the money in the world drive to the airport
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.820]  There's you know, you know what? I mean? That's how it works in a city
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  But I never would have guessed that they would get away with that here. You know what I mean?
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.660]  It's such a strong kind of Uniontown in some ways. It's such a strong town for like people who are protected
[35:14.760 --> 35:20.480]  You know interests like with the medallions and stuff kind of amazed that stuff has gotten as far as it has I am too
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.480]  I didn't know I didn't realize that I
[35:23.320 --> 35:25.320]  Don't know if you saw my tweet. I
[35:25.360 --> 35:26.920]  Don't know a week or two ago
[35:26.920 --> 35:32.020]  There was an article like like lyft start just started here in Philly and the article about lyft
[35:32.020 --> 35:37.700]  Was about how the whole thing like all the uber all the uber's in Philly are illegal
[35:38.260 --> 35:43.460]  There's they're not supposed to be operating in Philly. Well, it's like news to me. I've been using uber in Philly for like two years
[35:43.460 --> 35:46.080]  I had no idea. That's that's isn't that kind of mind-blowing
[35:46.460 --> 35:51.860]  It just seems like like one low-level government functionary could walk into that office to shut off the lights
[35:51.860 --> 35:58.420]  But like so they I mean black cars are obviously legal but not based on you know, not through the uber
[35:58.420 --> 36:04.180]  They're regulated. I mean, I guess I don't know what it is, but there's something like and you we have uber X now, too
[36:04.180 --> 36:06.180]  So we have the the you know
[36:06.460 --> 36:09.980]  Amateur cab driver version you meet some very interesting people with uber X
[36:10.500 --> 36:15.820]  And the whole thing was about how lyft, you know lyfts got the the pink mustaches on the cars
[36:15.820 --> 36:19.060]  Which makes them so easy to identify so that because they're illegal
[36:19.700 --> 36:23.740]  Like the but it's not enforced by the police. It's enforced by the parking authority
[36:23.740 --> 36:29.820]  The long arm of the parking authority, right, but I've heard stories
[36:29.820 --> 36:33.820]  I don't know if these are true, but I've heard anecdotes where people are like, okay fist bump get in now
[36:33.820 --> 36:36.860]  Put your put your bag in the trunk. We're friends. We've known each other since college like we're
[36:38.020 --> 36:41.100]  You know cuz the lyft experience is still a little
[36:41.940 --> 36:43.940]  little on the bubble
[36:44.620 --> 36:47.620]  Yeah, I'm not comfortable with it. Really. Yeah. Yeah
[36:48.540 --> 36:51.260]  Yeah, I'm not either but you know out here
[36:51.260 --> 36:56.380]  There's an article in the paper week or two ago about how I mean
[36:56.380 --> 37:02.820]  I find this totally plausible uber drivers are making like something like on average ten dollars an hour more than taxi drivers
[37:02.820 --> 37:04.020]  there's been a
[37:04.020 --> 37:05.860]  utter diaspora
[37:05.860 --> 37:11.100]  Of people leaving these taxi companies to go work for uber because it's just smart dell in it. Yeah
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.020]  I I've done that and when I first started using uber it was in San Francisco because you know
[37:16.020 --> 37:20.740]  It was early days when when uber was new and I don't know where that I don't maybe that was the only place where they were
[37:20.740 --> 37:22.180]  operating at first but
[37:22.180 --> 37:25.500]  I remember thinking well this sounds weird, right?
[37:25.500 --> 37:29.640]  This sounds weird, but I'll try it and I remember like the first couple of times I got in an uber
[37:29.640 --> 37:31.900]  I would be asked the driver. I was like, so do you how do you like this?
[37:31.900 --> 37:36.420]  Do you like this and to have never never was the answer anything other than I love it
[37:36.420 --> 37:39.300]  This is you know, this is great. Oh, absolutely
[37:39.820 --> 37:44.180]  And whereas if I get a cab ride, I've said this story elsewhere, but I recently last month
[37:44.180 --> 37:49.500]  I got a cab ride home from a gig and the entire time the guy had his right arm on the seat
[37:49.500 --> 37:52.860]  Turning around facing me the entire trip screaming
[37:52.860 --> 37:57.700]  He's like an uber anti uber activist, but the entire ride like I'm you know
[37:57.700 --> 38:02.340]  three sheets to the wind and just trying to put my headphones on and nod and he really wants to talk about uber and and
[38:02.420 --> 38:08.540]  It's it's it's the battle lines have been drawn. I tried using that app, but you know curb. Do you have that there?
[38:08.540 --> 38:11.580]  No, I don't think we do. There's an app at least in San Francisco
[38:12.100 --> 38:18.420]  That is the go-to app for ordering a cab in an uber like way. I've tried it three times and
[38:18.420 --> 38:20.140]  I'm waiting ten minutes
[38:20.140 --> 38:22.580]  I've never even gotten a response that a cab would even be available
[38:22.940 --> 38:25.580]  But just because I live out in kind of a crazy part of town
[38:25.780 --> 38:29.860]  So, I mean it's it's I don't love using it either and they kind of seem like dicks. I
[38:30.620 --> 38:35.060]  Mean no offense to duper, but there's some pretty crazy
[38:36.220 --> 38:40.500]  Decisions going on here. I'll send you a link. Here's what we've got. Okay. This is our new thing is
[38:41.140 --> 38:45.660]  215 get a cab. Okay, and all it's it's clearly like
[38:45.660 --> 38:47.660]  Like
[38:48.500 --> 38:50.020]  Like the
[38:50.020 --> 38:56.340]  The various cab companies have colluded to get I mean, I'm not colluded in any legal way, but it's not related. Yeah, it's
[38:58.260 --> 39:01.900]  It's it's it's in response to uber it's just no doubt about it
[39:01.900 --> 39:07.100]  It is it is in response to uber and they've got it plastered all over all of their I'll bet
[39:08.940 --> 39:14.140]  All of their vehicles to a five remember that time and so I feel like the thing that's funny to me though is they want
[39:14.140 --> 39:18.780]  Me to get the app, right? Yep, get the app and have the app have the app before it occurs
[39:18.780 --> 39:21.940]  Do you that you need a cab because you're drunk in an alley somewhere?
[39:21.940 --> 39:23.900]  Like what are you gonna do a downloader an app?
[39:23.900 --> 39:26.820]  Like you need to have it on your phone already probably and it's a new thing
[39:26.820 --> 39:32.460]  But they've come up with the name is a phone number like it's still the 80s and you've got to go
[39:32.460 --> 39:36.020]  You know, does everybody have a quarter give me a quarter. I got a call to get a cab
[39:36.540 --> 39:39.980]  Right, you know, you can just imagine the meeting with like, alright, we'll do the we'll do the app
[39:39.980 --> 39:41.980]  But it's got to be the phone number
[39:41.980 --> 39:46.900]  Right, and so they're there their website is two one five get a cab.com
[39:48.820 --> 39:52.380]  For some reason I'm reminded of I want to see like in the early 2000s when
[39:52.860 --> 39:58.460]  You know the dot-coms had already started the dot-com like retail comms the pets comm and all is clearly like things were a little rocky
[39:58.540 --> 40:04.220]  but there are more and more places that wanted to look like an e-business and I think a lot of them were basically just
[40:04.660 --> 40:09.360]  Like a CGI or a pearl script that sent something to a fax machine you go in and you fill out a form
[40:09.360 --> 40:12.960]  You do not have any sense that anything electronic was happening at all
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.560]  You know what? I mean not like today where you can like track things and stuff like that
[40:16.560 --> 40:20.280]  I think it used to be pretty Rube Goldberg to start a company like that, right? Yeah
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.600]  I like the idea though that I think it was probably was true though that a lot of places where you could order
[40:24.800 --> 40:27.760]  Online it would generate a fax or oh, that's how it works
[40:27.760 --> 40:30.760]  Now if you order a lot of food online, all it does is print something out
[40:30.760 --> 40:36.120]  I mean, obviously that's that's the installed base, you know, it just it just prints something out next to the cash register. I
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.120]  Don't know man
[40:40.280 --> 40:42.280]  Yeah
[40:42.880 --> 40:44.880]  Should we talk about vaccines? Oh
[40:48.200 --> 40:50.200]  Man ah
[40:50.520 --> 40:56.720]  Well, if we talk if we end up I was telling a friend of mine what our nominal topic for today was which I'm very excited
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.520]  About right and my friend responded by saying you were gonna get so much email
[41:02.560 --> 41:04.560]  We might as well jam it all into one episode
[41:04.560 --> 41:11.520]  Yeah vaccines. So the thing that got me about the vaccines is that with it being back in the news again is
[41:12.160 --> 41:13.320]  is
[41:13.320 --> 41:15.160]  like
[41:15.160 --> 41:16.640]  It's everywhere now, right?
[41:16.640 --> 41:19.280]  It's all it's percolated up to like the national
[41:19.600 --> 41:23.920]  Consciousness and it's on the news every day now and also and I was like why why all of us?
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.560]  I mean, this is not a new thing. I mean this is it's only a story if there's a controversy, right?
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.520]  That's that's the thing. I couldn't just go these people are dumbasses
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.280]  I will have to say well, there's still a couple scientists that haven't definitely decided on this
[41:36.280 --> 41:43.200]  It's and I realized it's obvious it's all because actual people got actual measles at Disneyland
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.800]  And I didn't really put I saw this story and I thought well
[41:47.800 --> 41:51.140]  Of course they are did because there's a bunch of dopes who aren't getting there
[41:51.140 --> 41:55.400]  There's so many people who aren't getting their kids immunized. Of course, there's an outbreak of me
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.720]  I wasn't I was so unsurprised right that there was an outbreak of measles at Disneyland that
[41:59.720 --> 42:04.440]  That I it seems like a perfect place for there to be a measles outbreak given the conditions
[42:04.440 --> 42:07.440]  I I couldn't believe that it was news, you know
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.080]  Whereas it's clearly is like the eye-opener for a lot of people like oh my god
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.080]  You know if you don't get your kid it just seems like that's a big part of the conversation is
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.840]  Holy shit, if millions of people don't immunize their kids these kids can get measles
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.640]  Like that seems to be our national conversation, yeah, it's really frustrating
[42:27.640 --> 42:29.640]  It's um
[42:30.240 --> 42:34.880]  Yeah, I don't know what to say. I also saw I saw an interesting poll on on
[42:35.360 --> 42:38.480]  By by age whether you support mandatory
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.760]  Immunization and it drops off so precipitously. It's like 70 year olds
[42:43.760 --> 42:49.800]  It's like almost universal support 60 year olds very high 50 40 kind of high and then when you all like once you get in
[42:49.800 --> 42:55.240]  Your 40s and 30s, it's lower and then you talk to kids in their 20s and it's like they you know
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.640]  It's like 15% support mandatory. That doesn't mean that they don't think people should do it. They're just saying it shouldn't be mandatory
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.240]  But I think that the reason that it's age it's like it's like reading to your kid
[43:05.240 --> 43:08.540]  That's one of those things. It's a good idea. But yeah, I don't really technically have to do that
[43:08.800 --> 43:12.460]  That's the idea like yeah, you don't have to do that. I don't have to give my kid a measles shot
[43:12.600 --> 43:15.400]  Well, the reason it's age-specific though is so obvious
[43:15.400 --> 43:19.320]  It's because older people remember what it's like when your neighbor had polio
[43:19.320 --> 43:26.240]  Right or they remember parents age who made it through the depression and watched a neighbor on one side of them lose three kids
[43:26.240 --> 43:28.320]  Right or a sibling even right?
[43:28.840 --> 43:36.480]  100% my grandmother lost a sibling to it flew in the I think, you know, right around World War one
[43:37.160 --> 43:39.880]  All right, so they've saw and then all of a sudden big
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.200]  Scientists come out with just a shot that makes your arms sore for a day and then you'll never get polio
[43:46.200 --> 43:48.200]  Oh, of course, they support it
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.200]  uh
[43:50.640 --> 43:55.960]  Yeah, I I don't know I I'm trying so hard to grow as a person John I'm trying really hard to
[43:56.640 --> 44:03.320]  Be sympathetic and understand everybody's position, but it it's one of the things that I think we talked years ago about the thing
[44:03.320 --> 44:05.320]  Remember the you told me this remember that there was a poll
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.000]  That something was what was the percentage of people who were thoroughly convinced that Obama is not
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.760]  Eligible to be president even late late late in that Lynn that in that rumor
[44:16.760 --> 44:22.840]  it was still like whether 40% or something ridiculous of people and it's like there's the thing is there's uh,
[44:23.360 --> 44:24.840]  you know
[44:24.840 --> 44:26.480]  there's there's a
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.040]  I've been reading this book
[44:28.040 --> 44:30.040]  That I'll apparently mention on every podcast
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.200]  Called the wisdom of insecurity by Alan Watts and he makes a distinction in that book that really knit and really hit me
[44:35.240 --> 44:38.200]  It's a distinction between faith and belief which I found
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.920]  Very persuasive with the idea that you know faith is a thing that we all have. Yeah
[44:42.920 --> 44:48.720]  There are sight unseen things that we there's some part of us that has faith that these kinds of things could happen that there
[44:48.720 --> 44:54.400]  might be a heaven or whatever which is really different from belief because belief is a kind of a more dangerous thing because belief is
[44:54.400 --> 44:58.160]  Where you know, there's not really that much to even discuss
[44:58.200 --> 45:04.080]  Like I've decided that this is how things are and nothing is gonna talk me out of this because now it's become part of who?
[45:04.080 --> 45:04.880]  I am now
[45:04.880 --> 45:08.440]  I am a person who believes this about vaccines or I believe this about Obama and
[45:08.440 --> 45:12.600]  You know, I think that that can become very internalized you and I probably have things like that
[45:12.600 --> 45:15.000]  There was not not even aware of but you know
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.800]  That's the dangerous part and there's no what we dumb liberals don't understand is there's no way there are never going to be enough
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.160]  Infographics Venn diagrams or horrifying maps to convince people of anything different. I mean Jesus Christ
[45:27.160 --> 45:30.320]  We had George W Bush in the White House for eight years people will believe anything
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.840]  Well, one of the things that's interesting about the I think the whole immunization thing is very sad and for anybody who's listening
[45:37.840 --> 45:42.800]  I do have enough listeners. I'm sure that there's got to be some of you who should stick to computers
[45:42.800 --> 45:48.440]  Yeah, stick to computers who have children. You've chosen not to immunize. I do I think one of the things that's
[45:49.640 --> 45:51.360]  So I wanted to I want to be a big person
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.120]  I want to be as I don't want to be insulting but I
[45:55.760 --> 46:01.840]  Think one of the things that's fascinating about it is that it has no traditional political divide. It's not a liberal thing or a
[46:02.680 --> 46:05.400]  Republican thing or a conservative thing or a rural thing
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.960]  It's like all over the map. It's you know, it's like when they pull I saw one poll
[46:10.960 --> 46:14.840]  That was like exactly 50-50 where like they talked to I don't know
[46:15.200 --> 46:19.960]  however, poll sample size number of parents who chose not to immunize their children and
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.120]  Who did you vote for in the last election and it was like 50-50 split really? Yeah
[46:25.120 --> 46:28.480]  I know do you think the reasons why they differ are different?
[46:29.800 --> 46:32.440]  Would they agree on the reason why they decide not to do that? I
[46:32.440 --> 46:34.480]  I you know
[46:34.480 --> 46:40.560]  I don't know but I remember one of the big reasons that it really caught on was I remember reading the article it was
[46:41.440 --> 46:48.640]  Robert F Kennedy jr. Wrote like a feature magazine length article. I don't know if it was for the Atlantic or one of those magazines like that
[46:50.440 --> 46:51.720]  You know
[46:51.720 --> 46:57.680]  Back when there was that one ingredient in the I mean, you know that they were they thought we worried
[46:57.680 --> 47:01.480]  We worried about that obvious with you. Yeah. Well Jonas was around that age
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.160]  I mean it was at the height of it. It was I think when Jonas was
[47:05.600 --> 47:10.080]  He just turned 11. So I think when Jonas was getting that's like his first year
[47:10.880 --> 47:12.880]  immunizations was
[47:12.920 --> 47:20.240]  But I think it was before that one paper in Britain had been debunked. Oh the Lancet article, right?
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.440]  I think it was before it was debunked. So it was definitely, you know, it was a thing
[47:24.440 --> 47:29.560]  I don't know. We were a little you know, I I didn't really put credence into it. But I you know, I was
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.160]  It was I just remember it being a thing. We talked about it. Mm-hmm
[47:34.160 --> 47:38.200]  We asked we asked a lot of questions for sure and they you know
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.040]  They were very sober about it and actually like oddly patient like you have to be with a new parent
[47:42.280 --> 47:44.880]  Because you know, we pretty much knew we were just gonna have the one kid
[47:44.880 --> 47:47.640]  it's like we don't get a lot of shots at this so to speak and
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.200]  We it was important to us to know that kind of stuff
[47:52.200 --> 47:57.800]  I don't feel dumb for asking those questions because they were very they were the doctor was very straightforward about it
[47:57.800 --> 48:03.640]  It's the same thing that hmm a lot of sensible people understand which is like there's risks to everything in life
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.400]  but what we can tell you is the risks associated with
[48:07.400 --> 48:12.920]  Vaccination are nothing compared with the very demonstrable risks of not vaccinating
[48:13.160 --> 48:19.240]  Yeah as an individual I think there's a risk analysis or cost-benefit. It's it's it's not even it's not even a comparison
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.240]  All right, and then I and I you know
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.680]  Especially when it comes to your kid, I think it's it's almost human instinct at least in our modern world
[48:26.680 --> 48:33.280]  we're where we're very as parents were very selfish about our children that we want will do anything for our kids and
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.340]  You know if you could prove that your kid might be better off without
[48:39.680 --> 48:46.980]  As an individual would be better off without immunizations versus the whole civic responsibility the herd, you know, the herd meant the herd
[48:47.960 --> 48:49.960]  advantage of getting everybody
[48:49.960 --> 48:56.960]  immunized I can see it and I think that's the basic thinking that's going on behind the people who chose not to immunize their children that
[48:56.960 --> 49:04.040]  They're they value, you know that they believe some kind of bad thing can happen from the immunization right and regardless of what it means
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.520]  But that's a sticky idea. That's a very durable idea whether or not it's true or accurate
[49:09.520 --> 49:13.840]  I can certainly understand why it's something that that I mean, I don't agree with it
[49:13.840 --> 49:16.680]  But I get why that's something that people feel is a big risk
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.120]  You know, but think about this. I mean, this is something where I think we all have
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.720]  I feel like I have a lot in common with other people which is you know, I've grown so
[49:26.520 --> 49:33.000]  I'm skeptical so cynical about all the turns out announcements about what's dangerous and and you know, there's been numerous
[49:33.320 --> 49:39.260]  You know articles over the years talking about the crazy history of stuff like the the food pyramid, right?
[49:39.260 --> 49:42.260]  The USDA's food pyramid, you know USDA. So what it is
[49:42.260 --> 49:44.320]  What's the one that puts out the food pyramid like in the 70s?
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.080]  we'd like make sure you have tons and tons of bread and you know what I mean, and
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.840]  But it was so USDA you I but it was very much apparently very much formed by these different
[49:54.280 --> 50:00.280]  Industries not to be like a nut or something, but your body was never meant to handle this much corn my god
[50:00.480 --> 50:05.920]  No one's supposed to jam this much corn into their hole. It's nuts. And then what happens if we go fats the enemy
[50:05.920 --> 50:09.700]  Okay, so quit eating eggs. All right, so now fast the enemy. So let's have snack wells
[50:09.700 --> 50:13.240]  So everyone sits around and eats fat-free brownies with three cups of sugar in it. Oh, wait a minute
[50:13.240 --> 50:18.480]  No, it turns out sugar is actually the enemy and so forth. Look no further back that in the last decade
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.480]  Look at fucking water bottles
[50:21.440 --> 50:26.440]  Do you follow this at all? No, what used to be you're like, oh you're killing the environment with all these cups
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.040]  So for God's sakes go out and buy a Nalgene bottle and you had to have a Nalgene bottle
[50:30.040 --> 50:35.960]  Where's your Nalgene bottle those stupid plastic bottles? Oh, no, guess what turns out phthalates. Oh my gosh
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.640]  You're gonna die because you're doing the right thing
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.080]  so now you should go and buy this kind of and now people are saying maybe those aluminum ones that we used to replace the
[50:42.080 --> 50:46.440]  Nalgene bottles are bad. You know, and the trouble is it doesn't it kind of doesn't matter
[50:46.440 --> 50:52.840]  What is actually true accurate accurate or known what matters is we are scared to hurt ourselves and our kids
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.680]  And we're always gonna try and have the most recent information that we can find about what we should do about it
[50:57.680 --> 51:00.880]  I mean, you're not even supposed to put plastic in the microwave anymore
[51:00.880 --> 51:02.720]  Like what do you put in the microwave, you know?
[51:02.720 --> 51:05.720]  Like I throw the goddamn thing out if you can't put plastic in it, it's useless
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.480]  Who who does I'm not gonna make a bowl to warm something up. I'm not a fucking monster. I
[51:10.480 --> 51:11.720]  I
[51:11.720 --> 51:14.880]  Remember coaching Little League a couple years ago
[51:14.880 --> 51:20.520]  I do I am familiar with the whole water bottle thing now and it had something to do with I think was phthalates
[51:20.520 --> 51:23.600]  I don't know. I know baby remember baby bottles and phthalates. I
[51:24.360 --> 51:30.120]  It's like it made me feel like time-traveling dad from the 1950s
[51:30.120 --> 51:35.700]  You know, like I'm just trying to make sure none of these kids get hit in the mouth with a baseball, right?
[51:35.700 --> 51:40.780]  The number one, I don't want anybody getting hit in the head with a baseball. It's a constant fear
[51:40.780 --> 51:46.780]  You've got 12 kids and at some point at least two of the 12 invariably are not paying attention to the game
[51:46.780 --> 51:51.020]  And therefore are at risk of getting hit in the head with a baseball which is bad
[51:51.340 --> 51:54.020]  So it's you know, every don't agree. We can all agree on that
[51:54.180 --> 51:56.180]  Every game is two hours of non-stop
[51:57.260 --> 52:02.780]  95% of my attention is don't let any of these kids get hit by a baseball and then 5% of my attention is let's you
[52:02.780 --> 52:07.000]  Know try to score some runs and get some outs and maybe win the game and in the meantime
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.820]  There's this whole thing with the other all the other. I'm not just moms either
[52:10.820 --> 52:14.560]  It's moms and dads and they're all talking about like oh you got to get rid of that bottle that bottles
[52:14.560 --> 52:19.900]  You can't drink out of that. Everybody's an expert and I'm just like just give the kids some damn water
[52:19.900 --> 52:25.140]  I don't know when I was a kid. We just we just said we'd finish each game with like 50 of those little
[52:25.140 --> 52:31.180]  Kind of like little juice boxes or oh sure the paper like the water cups. Yeah, the conical paper cup
[52:31.180 --> 52:33.680]  You just leave them on the field. Let the Indian clean them up
[52:34.820 --> 52:36.820]  You didn't even have to clean them up
[52:37.620 --> 52:40.300]  Yeah, totally totally and I mean, you know
[52:40.300 --> 52:45.360]  It is funny given like how you and I already come from kind of a pampered generation in so many ways
[52:45.900 --> 52:49.700]  We're probably the last generation that has a chance of doing better than our parents in life
[52:50.060 --> 52:51.180]  but
[52:51.180 --> 52:53.180]  for a while anyway, but you know, I
[52:53.180 --> 52:56.500]  I mentioned this a lot but like some of my I'm not okay guys
[52:56.500 --> 53:02.420]  I'm not advocating for this but I have such I wrote a thing about this one time just having this memory of our
[53:02.780 --> 53:04.100]  old green Pontiac
[53:04.100 --> 53:09.800]  My dad driving around smoking a butt with the windows down and me like standing on the seat
[53:09.980 --> 53:13.500]  Like or you can just stick your head out the window. You just do all this crazy stuff seat belts
[53:13.500 --> 53:18.620]  You've got to be kidding me. Do we even have seat belts, you know, and now today my daughter doesn't do anything without a helmet
[53:18.620 --> 53:21.420]  I mean that's that's on me like I want to protect her head
[53:21.420 --> 53:27.300]  But it is it is pretty it is pretty wild how many people manage to survive that now at the same time
[53:27.300 --> 53:29.300]  I was trying to explain
[53:29.380 --> 53:33.560]  To the best of my amateur ability how the what the world population is and how it works
[53:33.560 --> 53:35.660]  I was saying to my kid like, okay
[53:35.660 --> 53:40.700]  I think there's like what coming up on seven billion people something like that. I was like, can you guess why that keeps going up and
[53:41.420 --> 53:45.300]  My hints were well, you know, one of them is when mommy's and daddy's get together. What happens?
[53:45.300 --> 53:46.700]  She's well, they have their babies
[53:46.700 --> 53:47.140]  I don't like yeah
[53:47.140 --> 53:51.820]  and when those babies grow up and they become mommy's and daddy's what happens and they have like three kids and now she's like
[53:51.820 --> 53:54.920]  Oh, I said more kids and I was like, but the other thing is like then
[53:55.460 --> 54:02.260]  To our credit. I think people die of less completely preventable random shit than when I was a kid. I
[54:02.940 --> 54:08.780]  I've got to stipulate thank God for seat belts. They've made the road safer. The cars are safer. It's all safer
[54:09.060 --> 54:12.260]  Everybody knew somebody that had died in a car accident when I was a kid
[54:12.260 --> 54:18.380]  It was just the thing it was the cancer and car accidents killed and lung disease like killed everybody when I was a kid and they're
[54:18.380 --> 54:20.380]  All at least partially preventable
[54:21.060 --> 54:26.740]  Right a huge to a huge swath of car accidents are preventable. Well in addition to seat belts. There's the whole
[54:27.580 --> 54:32.700]  Have you seen the footage you had to that the difference in the crumple zones of like an old car in a new car?
[54:33.180 --> 54:35.180]  It's it's almost farcical
[54:35.180 --> 54:43.180]  Uh, yeah, oh man those driver's ed movies. I still think about him. I've never unbuckled a dead man. My
[54:43.460 --> 54:47.220]  Mom, my mom took our Pontiac to I don't even think she took to the dealership
[54:47.220 --> 54:49.820]  She took it to a mechanic and said look we bought this
[54:50.100 --> 54:53.420]  $8,000 car and it beeps when we sit in it if we don't put on the seat belt
[54:53.420 --> 54:57.100]  Can you turn that off and he said yes, I will turn that off for you. All right, I
[54:57.700 --> 54:59.700]  Or you just leave it so you leave it like
[55:00.260 --> 55:01.420]  Fastened all the time
[55:01.420 --> 55:05.940]  My sister and I were not allowed to use the seat belts because we would mess them up
[55:07.900 --> 55:12.580]  Like as you know, I mean like they wouldn't retract right anymore or that, you know, you get them twisted around
[55:12.580 --> 55:15.000]  It used to be pretty basic the way that it would retract
[55:15.340 --> 55:19.740]  Yeah, you could like get it off the runner like off the spool and it wouldn't go back in right?
[55:19.740 --> 55:20.260]  All right
[55:20.260 --> 55:27.000]  so at some point one of us had gotten one of the ones in the backseat twisted in the you know that the actual belt was
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.660]  Twisted in the what would you call that little cartridge kind of thing? Yeah the cartridge that would slide to make exactly what you mean
[55:33.660 --> 55:38.300]  They were really primitive. They didn't snap into place very well, and it was very easy when feeding it back
[55:38.300 --> 55:43.380]  It would be like a like a like a roller blind getting slightly off track at the beginning
[55:43.380 --> 55:44.580]  They being way off track by the day
[55:44.580 --> 55:48.600]  Yeah, it's a lot the only thing that's similar to it anymore are airplane seat belts
[55:48.620 --> 55:52.620]  But it was a lot of the buckling connection was a lot more primitive
[55:52.620 --> 55:54.740]  But the way that you could slide it on the belt
[55:54.740 --> 55:58.780]  Well, we'd gotten it twisted up and it took my mom a long time to unfix it
[55:58.780 --> 56:01.140]  And so from then on we weren't allowed to use seat belts
[56:02.060 --> 56:04.060]  Just let him go
[56:05.940 --> 56:11.060]  Took her 15 minutes to get him untangled. So then that was it no more seat belts. What do you um,
[56:11.540 --> 56:14.740]  What do you think's gonna happen with the vaccine stuff? Do you think it'll take a generation?
[56:15.700 --> 56:19.740]  Or does it take event generation or does it take a measles 9-11 like?
[56:19.740 --> 56:24.220]  What what do you think will change and how in the next however many end years?
[56:24.220 --> 56:27.620]  I've been thinking about I don't think I don't think there's any way to go back on it
[56:27.620 --> 56:33.300]  And and you know it part of it is what we were saying a couple minutes ago where you can't you come at them
[56:33.300 --> 56:36.260]  Like they've done studies said that you go at them with the most factual
[56:37.140 --> 56:43.820]  statistical approach of this relative safety of immunizations and the fact that you know, the the
[56:44.580 --> 56:47.820]  How horrible it is, you know measles can can make you blind
[56:47.820 --> 56:56.380]  Killed people. I think they said I'm just 40 46 people a day die from measles around what something like that around the world
[56:57.300 --> 57:03.740]  And you give them these facts and the people who don't want to vaccinate their kids get the facts and they come out of it
[57:03.780 --> 57:08.360]  More can I heard this I did hear that but you know facts are slippery things
[57:08.820 --> 57:11.500]  And I mean if somebody that you didn't trust
[57:11.580 --> 57:16.580]  Let's be honest if somebody you didn't trust that you considered to be a mouthpiece for an organization
[57:16.580 --> 57:23.300]  some kind of like like the Laramie cigarettes guys on the Simpsons if somebody came to came to you with some information and you knew
[57:23.300 --> 57:24.980]  That they were compromised
[57:24.980 --> 57:31.280]  Even if they gave you what they presented as facts you wouldn't listen to them or you probably wouldn't go look at the primary research
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.540]  Right. I'm you know, I'm the same way. I know what I believe. I know what I think is BS
[57:35.780 --> 57:37.660]  It's just that it's right back to that
[57:37.660 --> 57:43.060]  I think we've talked about this every time that Lakoff book don't think of an elephant if you have you have a certain mental model
[57:43.060 --> 57:49.300]  For how reality works and what relationships are and how you determine what's real and that that overrides or supersedes
[57:49.660 --> 57:52.740]  New information like by an order of magnitude, right?
[57:52.740 --> 57:58.580]  I mean, it's gotta I mean the way that you have conducted yourself in the world for however many n30 some years
[57:58.580 --> 58:02.340]  Whatever is likely to have such I totally buy that
[58:02.380 --> 58:07.780]  You know and what your family believes and what the people around you believe what the people your church believe it's constantly being
[58:08.060 --> 58:10.060]  Reinforced because that's part of your tribe
[58:10.060 --> 58:15.060]  That's what your tribe believes and there's no reason not to I mean, we've all got tribal things like that, right?
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.340]  Yeah, and you like the stupid that you like the Dallas Cowboys. You've got problems of your own
[58:19.020 --> 58:24.060]  that's part of the problem though is that there's there is a sort of tribal behavior where the the
[58:24.980 --> 58:31.460]  Kids who are not immunized tend to be clustered because it spreads and you become friend, you know
[58:31.460 --> 58:34.340]  I mean, we're not like super buddy buddy with any of the other parents at school
[58:34.340 --> 58:36.340]  but you talk to them and you know and it's like
[58:36.340 --> 58:42.340]  You it becomes like a thing where like now like I forget what it the the percentages in Marin County
[58:42.340 --> 58:43.540]  But it's just ridiculous
[58:43.540 --> 58:47.780]  Marin's got a lot of weird outliers Marin also has a used to have as far as I know like a
[58:48.460 --> 58:50.460]  improbably high rate of
[58:51.220 --> 58:55.740]  Breast cancer and I imagine there's ways that you could come up with with why that is that don't involve
[58:55.780 --> 59:00.220]  You know high power lines or something. It could be that they're getting detection better or something
[59:00.220 --> 59:02.620]  I don't I don't know but but yeah, yeah Marin
[59:03.140 --> 59:05.140]  Yeah, Marin's a thing. I
[59:05.140 --> 59:10.180]  I remember Scott Simpson said something made me laugh a long time ago when he had a kid and I didn't at the time have
[59:10.180 --> 59:14.260]  A kid and there was a toot he had back back in the in the Favard days
[59:14.620 --> 59:21.780]  He said something like there's two kinds. There's like, you know, two kinds of parents like there's the helicopter parents that are you know
[59:21.780 --> 59:26.500]  More protective than me and I hate them and then there's the the parents who are totally careless with their hit kids and I hate
[59:26.500 --> 59:27.940]  them too, like
[59:27.940 --> 59:33.280]  The way you evaluate everything is based on what you think everybody else is either too permissive or too strict
[59:33.280 --> 59:36.200]  It's so totally true. It's true. They're just a bunch of assholes
[59:38.600 --> 59:44.000]  Their kids and assholies doesn't even know how to tie his shoes and then there's the other kid is, you know, right
[59:44.000 --> 59:49.040]  Look at that guy. What's wrong with these parents? They're maniacs. They're kids a minute. She's come on kid
[59:49.040 --> 59:53.400]  It's it's a jungle gym. Let the kid play. Oh my god. I can't believe you let him get on the job
[59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.880]  Or even with what we want to talk about later like with movies
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.160]  Like I cannot believe they let their kid watch that or I can't believe that they don't want us to let him watch Harry Potter
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.640]  You know, oh, oh, this is this is what makes it. I texted you about this this morning
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.180]  I know we're not getting into it just now but not you know
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.180]  The way I tried to phrase this to my daughter and we'll come back to this was like, you know
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.920]  It's it's not just a matter of like, you know me. I like I like facet. I like as they say in academics
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.900]  I like problematizing I like taking something that seems obvious and figuring out how it's actually a mess and so like with kids and media
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.920]  It's not just like what do you show your kids? It's like hmm. It's like well, what kinds of stuff?
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:40.560]  Do you show your particular kid at what point in their life in what context etc, etc, etc?
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.120]  Because we all know every kids really different
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.680]  I mean anybody with two kids
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.480]  The kind of people who say Google's this kind of company apples this kind of company if you said to them your three kids are
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480]  Identical they'd hit you in the face
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.680]  Because all their kids are special flowers. So I know we'll come back to that. But oh, we're gonna get so much email
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.320]  We're gonna get a lot of you. Let me take a break. Let's take a break and thank
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:08.040]  another one of our sponsors good friends at Harry's now you guys know Harry's they're the people who make
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.640]  Top-notch men's shaving stuff. They've got razors. They've got razor handles
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.920]  They've got product, you know, like shaving cream shaving gel aftershave that kind of stuff
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.560]  And the basic gist behind their story is
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.240]  That they looked at the market for razors and shaving stuff and saw that it was a mess. It's stuff
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.360]  That's ugly. It's stuff that's overpriced
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.600]  It's stuff that's a pain in the ass to buy because you gotta go hit a button and ask somebody to come over with a key
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.440]  To let you please if I could could I please have some razor blades?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.920]  It's like when you remember remember when the compact disc stores used to lock the CD
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.480]  you know what I love I go to my Walgreens seven times a day and when I go there to buy some goddamn razor blades and
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.960]  I am a Harry's user now to be honest
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.280]  But when I go in there to get like if it's I'm traveling and I want to bring this particular razor with me
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.800]  I go there and it's the same
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.920]  Dingus kid that I see seven times a day and I say oh could I please have the lesson such, you know?
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.320]  $75 worth of blades, please. He's like are you ready to check out now? I'm like, no
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.640]  I want to walk around the store and steal stuff for a while. No, he's got to walk me
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:21.600]  All right, the assistant manager wants to walk me to the counter so that I don't steal his precious Gillette's no
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.680]  Worst I one time I had to I was at your neck of the woods
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.640]  I was in San Francisco for one of these Apple events or something like that. And I forgot my toothbrush. Well
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.840]  that's the sort of thing I
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.240]  Cannot I think not brushing your teeth for two or three days your mouth would feel hard
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.080]  But you got to take care of it
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.080]  I guess I probably should have just called down the front desk at the hotel and seeing if they could do it
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.520]  But I thought well I got to go out anyway, and I went on right there on Market Street, too
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.840]  I don't know. What is it? Is it a yeah like a CVS or Walgreens?
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.040]  Yeah, I forget what I get what you know, but I go in there and the goddamn toothbrushes were locked behind those what yeah
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.560]  Because I guess people steal toothbrushes. I don't know I ran out of deodorant
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.800]  I went to buy deodorant yesterday all the deodorant was under lock and key
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.840]  So I got to call some kid to come over and unlock a little deodorant jail to open up for me
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.360]  And then walk me to the counter like an animal right and they wonder why we're buying all our stuff for me
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:22.520]  Well, anyway, Harry's has this fixed. It's great stuff. They keep expanding their line. They've got new stuff
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.520]  So if you haven't checked them out in a while
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.000]  Go there. They have a new line limited edition razors the Jimmy chin line. They're inspired by
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.160]  Jimmy chin who's a I'd never heard him before but he's an explorer and photographer
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  There's some pretty cool photos from them
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.720]  But it's a new limited edition line of razors really really cool-looking
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.080]  They have great stuff. They also have they have these subscriptions
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.440]  I don't know if they calm shave plant you go there and you tell them how often you shave
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.840]  Do you shave every day? Do you shave once a week?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.380]  Tell them how often you shave and then you get a plan that will just have new stuff show up on a regular basis
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.440]  Right when you need it and you can cancel anytime you want to grow a beard you want to stop shaving you want to switch?
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.600]  To another brand you can just cancel at any time. It's like Tonks for for razors
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.040]  Really? So I mean like for example, I I've bought coffee like once in the last
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.560]  Year because there was like one stretch where I'd gotten ahead of my talks and needed to go
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.200]  Buy it. I don't buy razors anymore. I don't have to buy shaving cream anymore
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.720]  It just shows up on a regular basis from Harry's really great stuff and they have a special deal
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.440]  For listeners of the show the code is

[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.400]  What would make a good I will never buy anything from assholes who paid John Gruber for sponsorships
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960]  That was
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.840]  That was from our friend Dave over at math. He was looking through his
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:35.720]  He was looking through his his refers his refers over at mad.com. They sponsored a whole slew
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.760]  I love their sponsorships. Oh my god. That was the best sponsors ever
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.480]  I said still blows me away what they did with the Darren fireballs like the four
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.960]  Oh, did they do like a was like a 404 page or something?
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.800]  They once the one they did like three straight weeks and the water is a was a it was a typo
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.440]  And they wanted a typo at the URL. So it went to a 404 page
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:01.200]  And so they got one referral it's like a Google Analytics screenshot they posted right they had one
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.880]  That was just the title of the link was an ellipse
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.480]  It's just three dots and then it just said the message that only went in the feed
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.320]  It just said in this week before Christmas
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.120]  We thought it'd be nice to take our daring fireball sponsorship and not pitch you on anything
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.520]  Enjoy the holidays math and they didn't have a link it didn't it they signed it math
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.240]  But they didn't link to their website. There was no there was no URL. It just went nowhere
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:32.080]  And then the week before was the one where they had the the ASCII art of a guy flipping a table
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280]  That said Amazon
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.800]  Upside down like with those crazy Unicode characters that were happy holidays
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:44.780]  Right, which only made sense which was cool because it only made sense if you knew the backstory
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:52.720]  Yeah, that relationship. Yeah that they had started woot. That's the same guys who did woot and they sold the Amazon and
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:58.540]  Did you ever read that story like Paul kafasa sleep? Oh, yeah, I think I think I did it
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:04.100]  It sounds like it was not ideal. Yeah, it was like Amazon bought them and they didn't do well. They weren't happy
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.420]  it didn't seem like Amazon cared and and
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.620]  the founder had
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:17.940]  Like a breakfast with Jeff Bezos Bezos. Yeah, whatever and you know basis is going on and on about whatever and he's like
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.100]  Well, look, can I ask you a question? He was like, why did you buy woot?
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:27.840]  And it was like he just like stared at his like breakfast and there was like this one weird thing on his you know
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.180]  Breakfast platter, right like a some weird vegetable
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.380]  he was like
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:40.540]  Your thing was like this this piece of weird lettuce. I didn't understand it. So I wanted to buy it. I didn't get it
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:45.340]  So I just wanted to buy it. What a psycho. Yeah, it seems like a real nut job
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:51.580]  He does he seems easy and like the whole story of like the Amazon the fire phone. It just sounds nuts
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.660]  Yeah, that was some great reporting
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.980]  I forget if I talked about this on the show or if I just linked it up on during fireball
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.580]  but Austin Carr wrote that for a fast company and
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.980]  and really really top-notch like if you want to bemoan the lack of
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.860]  Actual reporting that goes on today, man
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.420]  That's a great counterexample because he really did the legwork
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:18.660]  He clearly got people who worked on that phone to talk and Bezos sounds like basically Bezos like it was his passion project
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:22.220]  He dove in with both feet and I don't say micromanaged
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:27.620]  But he like he had would not he would not go off his decisions at any point, right?
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:32.540]  Like he was very decisive about exactly how this thing was gonna work and wasn't listening to anybody. Yeah
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.280]  Yeah, I think long story short. Well, how did the fire phone come to be?
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.140]  I would say long story short based on Austin Carr's reporting
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.500]  It was something to the effect of we should do a phone if we do a phone
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:51.260]  Should it it should either be really cheap or it should be asked if it's not really cheap
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.320]  Then it has to compete with the iPhone. Oh in the 3d. It's got to do 3d, right?
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.060]  Well, it become like a thing. That was the thing like so then the next step Bezos was like, well
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:03.620]  I want to compete with the iPhone and because I think he wanted to make a phone that he would actually use right so like
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.820]  What's the point of like them making a cheap phone if they themselves are also gonna use iPhone?
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.300]  So they wanted to they're gonna go high-end then then the next step in the logical chain is well
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.980]  Then we have to have a hook right there has to be something if we're gonna sell a phone
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:20.780]  that's like four or five hundred bucks there has to be something that is compelling about it and
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:26.020]  Bezos latched on to this 3d thing, you know, everybody knows the basic, you know
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:33.800]  That there's 3d interface that using accelerometers and the four cameras on the front, you know that it can it without any special glasses
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:39.420]  it makes like a fake 3d effect on the flat surface of the phone and
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.620]  It there was like no budging him off that that's you know, that's like our Siri
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.060]  that's our hook that we can advertise everybody's gonna go nuts for it and
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:54.300]  There was apparently a lot of internal skepticism that this would have any actual appeal like well, what's the point?
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.900]  It's a neat the gist of a lot of the people seem to think well, it is a neat trick
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:03.460]  But what is the point and then the phone shipped and everybody said well, it's a neat trick, but what's the point?
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.080]  But he stuck with it
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.740]  Right. Well, he printed up a lot of cardboard boxes that said buy a fire phone
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.880]  That was so weird the first time I got an Amazon box with that that on the tape
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.900]  I was like what I was like somebody sent me an Amazon fire phone. I thought the same thing
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.500]  I thought the same thing cuz every you know, and I thought it was be believable for me because
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.740]  Nobody's ever sent me a phone like no company, but like I do get some equipment to try
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.060]  You weren't in that Sprint program back in the day
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.900]  No, I was in some I well
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:41.100]  I've gotten I got the g1 from Google HTC was nice enough to send me that I remember that that was fun
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:47.660]  And but I was in this thing where Sprint would just they were sending bloggers like new phones every few months like in the days
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.220]  Before I remember cuz it was around the time of the iPhone and I finally got this
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:57.900]  Totally crazy looking one where it had screens on both sides and it was kind of meant to look like an iPhone
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:03.140]  But you would do stuff you would need to flip the phone around and use different keyboards and a touchscreen was totally crazy
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.500]  Well, but it's not outlandish to know that somebody would send me a fire phone
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.140]  And that's what I thought it was and it was a box
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.700]  It was a box that was about the size that a phone might come in
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.020]  I was like, I cannot believe somebody sent me a fire phone
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.140]  And I opened it up and it was I don't know toothpaste so great
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.580]  All right
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:27.500]  Should we do it? Well, let's do one more thing and then we'll do it. Here's the other thing
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.180]  I want to go circle back on the on the vaccination. Oh Jesus
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:36.380]  Well, not vaccinations in particular, but to me it's it's a product of the internet age
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:42.540]  this is why I'm a little pessimistic about it getting fixed because I think pre-internet you
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.020]  There just wasn't enough
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.860]  information for people to do that like
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.220]  You know your best source of information on the health of your kid was what your pediatrician told you and if your pediatrician said
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.760]  We recommend these immunizations on this schedule
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:01.620]  Well, you know your way and maybe you might rely on your family, too, right?
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:05.620]  Yeah, think about like the things you hear about brand loyalty and how people who are pampers
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:10.980]  You know the mom used pampers so they use pampers and we're Heinz ketchup family and so forth
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.380]  Like, you know
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.740]  I think a lot of people especially at a young and impressionable age
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.280]  Having a kid take a lot of that from from what their family would say they'd be like, are you kidding me?
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:23.020]  You know, you know aunt Linda died because she wasn't vaccinated. Of course, you're gonna vaccinate your kids
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.260]  And it's you know that now though, you know
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.500]  I'm not that I'm not trying to say that pre-internet that nobody questioned their doctor. Of course
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.800]  I mean, you know the second opinion is part of our vernacular, you know
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.580]  Of course people might question their doctor, especially if you know
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.680]  The recommendation was surgery or something like that
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.580]  But now it's so easy for people to just find what they want to find
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.580]  Whereas you couldn't do that before and there's that stencil. It's a spray-painted stencil
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:56.240]  It's all you know, you can't go anywhere without seeing it, but you see it everywhere this the saying stop making stupid people famous
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.640]  Right, which is trite, but it's true
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.100]  It is absolutely the problem of the modern age is that we've made a lot of stupid people
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.960]  Very famous and not but we also feel like think about something like web MD
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.520]  And I don't think any of us can say we've never looked at web MD
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.240]  Well, we're pretty sure we have cancer like, you know
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:22.400]  There is also the the internet has empowered us to believe that we we can learn a lot on our own
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.920]  I guess this is kind of what you're already saying
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.900]  But you know now we feel like there's this resource in the same way that we might not go spend several weeks at the library
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:35.060]  You know looking up carcinoma now today, like we'll keep fun. Let's keep looking until we find the thing that makes sense to us
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.240]  Yeah, and it's you know
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:37.620]  Yeah
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.660]  Again, the worst thing you can possibly do when you have some kind of health problem is Google it and it's of course the first
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:47.580]  Thing that we all do I mean you can't help but do it, but it's the worst thing you can do totally
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.140]  It's because it's just gonna it now you have whatever your problem is and now you've got terrible anxiety about it
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.660]  Because you've proven that you have you know
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.120]  Something incurable. Have you ever gone into a doctor's office with the printout?
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:06.360]  No, I have not. Mmm. They do not like that. Nope, but I'm not saying I wouldn't though, right?
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.720]  I'm not saying I wouldn't I'm just saying I haven't see Amy doing a
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.720]  Lot of research I could see her being a very well-informed, you know with the kid stuff
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.200]  I could see her being a very well-informed parent all that stuff. Yeah, I think she's very she's hyper informed
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.660]  You know, I'd you know hyper vigilant right like she's got him
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.220]  She's got that EpiPen like, you know, she's like Marshall Dillon with that thing, right?
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.540]  Yeah, and she does she really does know an awful lot about it. I'm again
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.500]  I don't I think she'd be the first to tell you that she does not know more than
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:41.200]  Our Jonas's allergist does but she certainly knows a lot more than she used to yeah
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.100]  But I do think that that's I don't know
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:48.220]  I feel like that's a big part of the problem of the modern age is that you're gonna be you know
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:53.940]  there's a there's a it's easy for anybody to have a a
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:01.300]  Soap box and get you know more than just the people who can you know in the old days if you're a lunatic
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:07.580]  Only the people within your earshot could hear you now anybody can can listen. Yeah, it's funny
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.020]  There's all these little setting aside the dark web or the darknet or whatever
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.780]  there's this one funny sort of
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:18.140]  Source of information that's been around for a long time, but still remains
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:22.720]  Largely hidden from plain sight which is forums or fora I guess
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.180]  Yeah
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:29.340]  There are so many places with you Google for certain kinds of information all kinds of certain kinds of information
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.080]  You are very likely to and and I just somebody suggested for example yesterday
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.300]  I was talking I think yesterday on back to work talking about how I'm trying not to drink too much coffee
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.240]  You know
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.220]  I don't want to be too spazzy and somebody had recommended this stuff called L
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:47.500]  thea mean or something like that which is like a green tea extract or something and so I went in and I googled it and
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:54.100]  Like so many results on forums where people are like saying the most outlandish things
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.020]  But like I kept reading it
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.860]  I I immediately felt like
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.500]  You know
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.420]  I gotta take all this with a grain of salt
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:05.260]  But I still kept reading looking for somebody who sounded like they knew what they were talking about and I have no way of knowing
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.220]  If anybody's knows what they're talking about. I think it's a very common thing
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:14.860]  Do you find I find that as I'm getting older and if I find that I'm getting a lot more sensitive to things like
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500]  Having drunk too much coffee
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.540]  And I don't think it's I don't think it's like I think it's actually more of like a self-awareness
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:27.900]  though then like not that I used to be able to metabolize more it's that I would drink too much coffee and
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:33.780]  Wouldn't even notice whereas now I'm like, wow, my brain is bananas right now. Oh, yeah
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:39.860]  I yeah, I talk about this a lot on the show with Dan. I I mean I have to be very circumspect about
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.620]  Something that sounds I'm unbelievable to me now
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:48.380]  Which is that I have to be very careful about how much caffeine or stimulants in general
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.380]  I put in my body after about 12 for one
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:55.500]  Because they say the half-life or like that's mostly out of your body in like eight hours and that's not true for me
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.180]  I'll just be laying if I have a coffee at two
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.180]  I'll just be laying there in bed with my heart beating and
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:04.700]  So and and also the nothing I said other places is I feel like I don't always get the same positive
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:08.300]  Effects that I used to get but I definitely still get all the negative effects
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.380]  You know what?
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:09.980]  I mean
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.100]  where I don't used to be where I was like
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.700]  I'm young and virile and I can have Thai food and coffee at 11 at night
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:22.840]  And now today like that's just that's a terrible idea for me. So yeah the sensitivity for real. Yeah, there's lots of stuff like that
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.460]  Foods too. I mean
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:31.040]  Anyway, I make the same amount of coffee every day and I think it's you know, it's like the right dose for me
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.240]  But then like I used to I don't really do anymore like sometimes I just get bored at 4 in the afternoon and think well
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.860]  I'll have another I'll you know, go make my whole life. That's exactly what I would do
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:44.140]  So people eat at 3 o'clock and I'm like, I want to have a coffee. I'll go make one
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:52.060]  I'll make one cup with the Aeropress and then I'll you know taste a little better and and then I'm you know at like 6 p.m
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:59.740]  I'm like wait, I've been trying to read this 800 word article for half an hour and instead I've got 20 other tabs here
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:03.780]  I won't really wanted to read this article. What happened? I totally had that this morning. I think then I'm like
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:10.020]  Yeah, well and then I'm like, oh, that's a freaking coffee. I should not have had that extra coffee
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.060]  I did that this morning
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:17.100]  I had two cups of coffee and I sat down to read the entire Wikipedia page on the history of the MPAA
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.980]  Rating system which doesn't seem that hard, you know, it's pretty standard English
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.980]  I got like I got like two headings in and I was like, let's ride bikes. I you know, I couldn't even concentrate
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.860]  So I'm slightly prepped but
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100]  Alright, let me do one more
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.740]  Sponsor. Okay, and that is our good friends at
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.020]  fracture and you guys know fracture fracture is
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:44.400]  A place you send them your photos your images they print those photos
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.540]  Directly onto glass and then they put them in a really cool
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:53.100]  cardboard package that serves after you open the package as
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:19:00.420]  The thing that you can use to hang it on the wall or the thing you can fold out to prop it up on your
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.460]  Desk or your mantle or wherever you want to put it
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.300]  all self-contained
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:10.700]  Right there and your photos printed beautifully directly on glass. I
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:18.080]  Always use the same analogy that it comes across like the way when they started laminating the LCDs to the iPhone displays
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.460]  And makes the pixels look like they're right on the glass
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:25.460]  Well, that's what your printed photos look like when you get them from fracture really beautiful
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:31.220]  I just can't emphasize how easy it is. Once you get them in your house. It's ready to be hung
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:36.940]  You don't have to take it and go get the frames at IKEA or wherever and then put the photo in a frame
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.680]  That it is a frame. It's right there has no border. It's beautiful
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.780]  great great gift idea
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.940]  Probably too late, I guess for you guys for Valentine's Day, but I don't know Mother's Day is coming up
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.980]  That's for sure great gift idea
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:56.880]  Just go there check them out and they have great prices. They have all sorts of sizes
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.940]  From really small to really really big
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:08.320]  There's the square ones so you can print your instagrams whatever you want to do really great stuff
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.840]  I cannot emphasize enough if you have any reason that you want to print a photo take a good photo of your kid
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.500]  I should I should get this one. Hang on on the wall. Go to fracture do it there. You will not regret it
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:24.580]  Their website fracture me calm fracture me calm and they have a code
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:30.980]  Daring fireball all one word and you'll save 15% on any order. That's real cash
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:36.980]  So go to fracture me calm get a photo printed out and use that code during fireball. You'll save some money
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.140]  All right, here's the idea
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.760]  What do you want to do out you you you mentioned it because it was actually your idea at first
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:50.120]  No, you know, you can go ahead. Well the basic idea not to turn it into a parenting podcast, but it's it's
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.720]  the
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.360]  overarching dilemma of what movies
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.200]  Do you let your kids watch when?
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.120]  Like what age like where do you balance this and I have found it to be Oh
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.600]  For the you know from the get-go right from when he was Jonas was old enough to just sit in front of a TV
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.640]  It's a vexing dilemma, and I never totally a moving target. I
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.000]  Totally and I never anticipated it being difficult. I
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.320]  Just always thought before I had a kid that at any given moment
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:28.160]  You could give me any movie or TV show and I could instantly tell you whether it was age-appropriate or not
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.520]  But it ends up being I think devilishly tricky. Well exactly right
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.400]  So, I mean the only thing I would want to establish is that you know, we went to college and stuff
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:42.800]  We understand that there are things like ratings. I think that the part that makes this so challenging is how different every kid is in
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  terms of what they are sensitive to
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:51.460]  What's likely to be problematic or you know to cause troubles and nightmares?
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:57.640]  It's it's not as simple I would I would I would postulate it's not nearly as simple as just saying I'm gonna trust the MPAA
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.320]  Because there are plenty of g-rated movies with stuff in it that a three-year-old some three-year-olds
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.840]  Right a given three-year-old should not see and if the parents know that
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.960]  Like, you know, it's really good to avoid that. I mean one that comes up a lot
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.520]  It's like scary music a genre of what's just called scary music like boom cellos
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.720]  We're going into the woods some kids that could watch somebody be decapitated
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:25.000]  Freak out my daughter things jumping into and out of frame completely freak her out real
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.600]  Oh, yeah, you know like in like a horror movie kind of thing like where somebody I know you yeah
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.560]  They're like in the background pops up
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.800]  Even in in any kind of a movie no matter how innocuous it can kind of freak her out
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.600]  So yeah, exactly
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.280]  It's it's not the thing is it's and then on the other hand
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.960]  There are some kids we're like if you fast forward through this one scene or this other scene
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:51.320]  They would be totally fine watching some pg-13 movies and it's just it's I I think it's I'm sure we both have some horror
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.800]  stories about terrible decisions
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:58.200]  But also just I think it's interesting to talk about because I think everybody wants to look like they're real smart about it
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.960]  And I think almost everybody who less their kid watch movies
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.880]  Worries about it. We're worried about getting the mix wrong. Yeah, and
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.560]  I'll give you one example from from Jonas
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:16.360]  When he was young and we I would say on the grand scheme of things. We are relatively permissive and I always have been
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.280]  but I don't think I do and
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.100]  Because I used to shake my head when you would tell me things that you
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.760]  would let him do and now I do the same stuff I
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:34.560]  But also I really feel like a big part of that though was knowing what he was good with and he was good
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.120]  Well, I think with relatively advanced
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:43.400]  Like violence in movies, you know, he watched Star Wars very very young and you know
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:47.200]  I don't think that there I watched it when I was in kindergarten too. That was my thinking
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.520]  I don't know. I was in kindergarten when I came out and I turned out alright
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.580]  But I remember but it you never know though there's always a little thing
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:58.360]  So one of the we let him watch the Pirates of the Caribbean movies at a very early age
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.040]  And I think that those are PG I don't think they're pg-13, I don't know man, they got some pretty spooky stuff
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.200]  Well, he didn't but the point is he didn't mind it
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:14.800]  No, not at all except for one scene which is and I don't remember which one of them it's in but there's one scene where?
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.360]  I must have been the first one where they're going after the gold that if you stole the gold you became a ghost or whatever
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.000]  And he had a drop a piece of blood and they cut
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.320]  Somebody somebody takes a knife and just puts like a little like a PG rated cut on the palm of somebody's hand
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.920]  oh, yeah, and
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.520]  He it just flipped him out and he had like a fit and he was like we're like, what's wrong?
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.080]  What's wrong? And he just was holding his hand and he said like I can feel it
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:48.300]  I can feel it and he's just screaming like it made him feel as though his hand had been cut but my kid will come
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:51.260]  Compulsively and I was the word I'm looking for
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.580]  Well, like automatically like violently turn away from the screen whenever there's blood like, you know
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:00.500]  Like a cut or something like that or like a wound. It's it's she absolutely turns away. Yeah, and so we
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.620]  You know, it was like, you know middle of the day noon, you know me working at home, you know
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.540]  You know five six years ago
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:15.300]  And we both looked at each other like we just gave each other this look like oh my god
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.340]  What if we don't we've we've wrecked this poor child's mind by letting him watch this movie that we should have known
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.340]  He was too young to watch
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.940]  But you just never know and then and he would be good
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:30.800]  He wouldn't refuse to watch that movie, but I'll tell you what he had it down stone
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.160]  He knew exactly when that scene was coming up and he would run out and he would say what he used to say
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.220]  He'd call it past past forward
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:41.420]  My daughter would say fast over
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.060]  fast over that
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.020]  anytime when they got to the point
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:51.700]  Where in Toy Story 2 when buzz has to at the beginning in the video game when he has to walk out across the floating
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.980]  Discs. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Should I say daddy fast over?
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.780]  Fast over. I like that one too. They're both good pass forward. Oh my god. It's
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580]  Jonas's list included
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:10.180]  The Wampa no Wampa. Oh, and that's a good that's another example of it of a jumping into frame thing
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.700]  Yeah, you know what? That's it
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:18.020]  Yeah, because you know and and they and the suspense right it's because the the Wampa
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.340]  The first time you see him
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:22.740]  It's the shock here
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.660]  Right, like Luke is like looking for comments or whatever to hit the you know
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:31.500]  Hit the ground and all of a sudden boom the Wampa jumps into frame. Yep, and may and makes a terrible noise
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:38.060]  So you've got that right that in the ad that Jonas didn't like that and Jonas wanted that whole the whole thing
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:43.900]  Skip though because he also could not bear the suspense of Luke. I think hang in there like a side of beef
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.780]  Yeah, and not you know, it's like the first time he's ever even tried to use the force to get a lightsaber
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:53.500]  And it's just sitting there jiggling, you know, it's it's like, you know, it's like film school 101, you know
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:57.740]  Like how to build a little suspense, you know, jiggle the lightsaber do this the mute, you know
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:04.160]  Perfect, of course John Williams score for the moment which furthers the the suspense couldn't take it
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.180]  It would just is it would just what about one that I was scared of and my kid was scared of what about when?
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.420]  in episode four when Luke's looking through the binoculars and the Tusken Raider
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:22.300]  No, not at all, even though to me it's actually just it's the same thing right? Yeah. No. Yeah, it didn't bother him. Nope
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:30.140]  That's so weird. See this is what I'm talking about. All right, the Wampa terrifying the Tusken Raider who does the exact same thing
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:36.740]  Thing you know, but you know here's but you get I remember talking about how I about this and about how his daughter
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.180]  He felt like his daughter was, you know, very sensitive to certain kinds of thing
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:46.500]  She's a really sweet kid and it's like relationship things and some people are very sensitive to almost everything and other people it's virtually impossible
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:50.060]  To tell my daughter has seen some really grizzly shit in movies
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:53.740]  Like she saw Deadpool putting her head putting his head back on at the end of the next time
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.820]  I didn't show her the whole movie
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.660]  I just like you got to see the scene where they put his head back on. It's pretty great a
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:04.380]  Terrible movie but but there are some things where I can't guess. Okay. So for example, she's watched a ton of Doctor Who little scared
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.380]  by the Daleks she's watched
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:13.660]  Pretty much almost every Marvel movie except for a few and all the Star Wars movies numerous times
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.780]  But then you know we watch turn out
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:21.300]  Did you ever see that that show on Cartoon Network from last year called over the garden wall? No, never
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:24.840]  It's kind of like it's an adventure time II thing about these two little boys who are brothers
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:31.240]  Having these like kind of fairy tale adventures combined with like a silly symphonies cartoon feel it's a really great show
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:38.240]  But it is like a fairy tale kind of show where there's scary stuff. That's not exactly explained
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.040]  There's this it's but it's a kids show
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.360]  it's like it is in the same way as adventure time kind of it's kind of a kids show and
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.460]  That is the one stuck with her this creature on there called the Beast and I didn't find out for weeks that like she thought
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:54.640]  The Beast was under her bed. She was scared to even say anything and I was like, oh, honey, I am so sorry
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.960]  And mom, of course gives me the eyes. It's like see see see I knew this was gonna happen
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.840]  But again, would you guess I mean like she didn't mind people's faces melting off and Raiders of the Lost Ark
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:11.600]  But the idea of like a black beat this this kind of cartoon bear in the forest is terrifying. Who knows?
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.000]  Yeah, I remember I had a friend growing up who I
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.800]  I missed I don't know how but I missed Raiders of the Lost Ark when it was in the theaters, so I didn't see it. Mm-hmm
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.000]  But it always bothered me. How old were you? I was I was about 13 14. I was I was eight
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.700]  Okay, so, you know, I are nine eight. I think with 90 in 1981. So I was eight
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.480]  But I desperately wanted to see it couldn't understand how I missed it, you know
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.080]  It seemed like something I could have got my dad to take me to it somehow I missed it
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.160]  But then you know, of course once it was out of theaters, there was no chance to see it
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:49.760]  But I knew the basic story and I just knew that there was something about at the end
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.200]  everybody's faces melted and my one friend growing up was like
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.960]  Completely freaked out about it
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:01.440]  Like he had gone to see it and came out like crying like embarrassed himself like his mom, you know came out of the movie theater
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.440]  He wasn't scary because it isn't just that like haha little skin melts off
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.640]  It's like a full-on Ray Harry housing thing where like their entire head like it's a horrifying
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360]  really effective effect
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.880]  yeah, yeah, but he was freaked out and he was the type of kid who just would not, you know, he wasn't like a
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.520]  Sense, you wouldn't call him a sensitive kid. You really wouldn't know
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.880]  It's just a normal boy who's going to see what should be and that just was happened to be his thing
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.360]  Yeah, like it just touched a nerve. What about
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:38.400]  Have you seen either the trailer or the movie for Paddington? That's probably a little young for Jonas. Yeah
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:44.200]  See the trailer, right? I've seen the trailer. Okay, the trailer I have heard from friends that the movie is
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.880]  What's one of those movies one of those rare movies with the movies actually way better than the trailer looks which I'm very glad to
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.840]  Hear but you've seen the trailer. There's a scene where he's in the bathroom
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:56.120]  I don't I guess I'm gonna someday my daughter's gonna hear this. I'm gonna be in so much trouble
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:02.520]  There's a scene in the bathroom where he's like interacting with what it is to be a bear using the bathroom and he takes a toothbrush
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:08.360]  And sticks it in his ear and pulls out this giant wad of totally disgusting looking earwax
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:16.080]  It's a dumb shot. It's about three seconds. And if I say the word Paddington, my kid gets freaked out
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.320]  She cannot stop thinking about the disgusting earwax
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.680]  She will hear nothing about going to see that movie because of this one scene with earwax
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:28.040]  Remember she's seen Deadpool put his head back on but the earwax thing put her off her beer. Yeah, it's
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.280]  Inexplicable. Here's here's the if I can I toss out one more axis in bad parenting is
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.720]  the
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.480]  Balance weighing weighing the balance. Okay, so let's let's take an extreme example
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:47.180]  Like would you has it let's take a kid who's like a classic introduction to movies age of like five
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.960]  Like would you show your kid the third
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:58.600]  X-men movie if they're five years old see now me I'm gonna go. You know what? I'm not
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:04.760]  Because it's not a very good movie. There is a lot of inside words in it as we say in our house
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.080]  There is some violence in it, but you know what? It's just not worth it because whatever she sees it
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.280]  It's not worth it cuz the movies not that good. Would you hesitate to show your kid Toy Story 2? Oh my gosh
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:21.240]  No, it's got scary things in it a little bit, but it's so worth it. Right? So isn't that part of the balance though?
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.400]  It isn't like you're making your kids sit there and watch castle freak or something
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:30.780]  Like you're thinking like oh, this is a perfect. Is this the perfect age to introduce this wonderful story to this kid
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360]  Yeah, that's a very good point
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.360]  It has to be you know, the quality of the movie factors
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.640]  I mean in my own defense
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.000]  I'm sitting there with her watching the movie like what you know
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.660]  Except in the case of Mulan to when I'm on my iPad like I am there watching the movie with her
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:49.840]  We're talking about the movie not that it's like, you know, freaking Harvard or something
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.880]  But just to be clear like I it's got to be a movie
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:56.080]  I like it's got to be good and it's got to be appropriate given what I can know or guess. I
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:04.600]  Totally agree with that. I think you know what else had Jonas seen early
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.480]  I mean he saw the Bond movies back when Dan and I were talking about him
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.240]  I mean, you know, I don't know if you watched all of them with me
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.320]  but he sat through a bunch of them with me and
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:17.520]  that was weird on two levels because it also in addition to the fact that it's kind of violent for a
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.320]  A kid who was probably six or seven at the time
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.320]  There's the anachronisms
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.720]  Right. I mean, you know, I think Dan and I spent like half an hour just got you on the pacing
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.720]  And this is this is one that blew me out of the water
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.240]  I sent you that picture of my kid punching goldfinger in the face at a casino
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.920]  Here's the thing. I was I knew this one was gonna be a lot
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.480]  People are gonna think that that yeah, that was like a total Merlin euphemism
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:48.400]  But that you literally sent me a text with a picture of your daughter. Yeah next to a picture of gold
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.400]  unlicensed mural of James Bond characters
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.960]  Gold finger in the face
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.240]  Okay, so
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.840]  Okay, and this one I barely barely barely got this one past the censors
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.640]  My wife was pretty iffy about this because if it's one where we're really worried
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.880]  I will watch the entire movie through again to be sure I definitely we have to find time to talk about 80s movies and how
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.160]  What completely weird animals 80s movies are because you never know when some boobies are gonna show up in an 80s movie
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.160]  It's crazy. But
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.880]  Goldfinger I was like, oh, it's it really is the best James Bond movie and it's got us kind of a silly plot
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:31.640]  But it's not that hard to follow. But you know what? My main thing was I was like she is going to watch
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:36.160]  She'll watch up to when he takes off the scuba thing and have his tux on that's pretty funny
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.320]  But I was like the pacing of this movie by her standards is so glacial. There's no way
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:46.480]  She's gonna watch more than 20 minutes and then it became the movie that she demanded to watch. It was completely perplexing
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.320]  She's watching a thing where people are sitting and drinking mint juleps and Kentucky and talking about contaminating gold. I was blown away
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.280]  So again bad
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.440]  I'm I had no idea that end up being one that she really likes and also when the laser almost cuts him in the penis
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.440]  She turns because it's gonna cut him in the penis
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.640]  We did it in
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.220]  11 so Jonas was seven and when I let him that's that watch the same here with her. Yeah, right
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.600]  Seven I don't think I watched it when I was seven. It was on TV once a year. I
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.160]  Think the same way, I don't know. I mean, you know one thing too with the violence
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.680]  I know and and I know a lot of the you know, there's
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.520]  One of the big three there's violence
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:30.200]  Language and sex right? I mean, that's it's the big three like concerns
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:37.560]  Yeah, it's smoking got sass mouth, but I would say violence scariness scariness is I would say scariness is probably the top issue
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.880]  Because I really do think that the you know, like a truly scary movie, you know can upset a kid for days
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.760]  I do realize I absolutely
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:53.640]  Realized that there are some kids a lot of times boys who if they see like a movie where there's a lot of like
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:36:01.480]  shooting action even in a sort of cartoony way like Star Wars that it gets the kid all amped up and then the kid starts
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.480]  Jumping around the house smashing things, right?
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.240]  Like, you know, they're like like I've shown her bits
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.000]  I've shown her YouTube videos of Bruce Lee like a best of Bruce Lee or something like that
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.440]  And she just wants to kick everything after that
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  Well and or worse that you wanted kids want to kick other kids. Yeah, right
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.760]  well Jonas has never ever been like to Jonas is a very gentle kid and it's
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.280]  Anything that he sees in the movie does not alter his behavior, you know in the real world
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.620]  So, I mean, I think it allowed us to be a little permissive, you know in that way
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.640]  But I think most kids are actually pretty good that way. I think it's kind of rare, you know
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.520]  So the violence we've always you know, I don't know been a little liberal on it depends on the violence
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.380]  It depends on I mean, you know
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.520]  The thing is there are phrases that I would hear people use before I had a child and I would I would just I would want
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.640]  To strangle the person the phrase a phrase I used to sneer at imitative behavior
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.440]  You know, that's sometimes in these reviews. You'll see well, it contains, you know, sass mouth and imitative behavior meaning
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.840]  You know the Three Stooges, right? That's a good example
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.800]  Like if you watch enough Three Stooges, you're probably gonna want to hit somebody on the head
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.000]  You know Maggie Simpson with the mallet or whatever
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.600]  But I think I think there's also I have fun. This is really where I don't know
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.220]  I'm out on a limb, but I think there are differences. There's different kinds of violence
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:21.420]  I think stormtroopers getting bloodlessly shot with comic book violence is really different from Hellraiser
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.320]  Or or like this like saw I think there is a really big difference in degree and the personal miss of it
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.880]  So like there are some things and again, we got to talk about 70s and 80s movies. There is so much
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.260]  Completely random weird nudity and sex in 70s and 80s movies, especially 80s movies
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.780]  But there's also some like extremely personal violence in in those kinds of movies
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.420]  So like the idea of like holding somebody with a knife to their throat and cutting them
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:50.420]  I think of that as a different kind of animal than a stormtrooper getting shot personally
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.860]  yeah, I do too or even with just sticking to guns with
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:38:00.780]  Like when Bond especially in the older ones when Bond shoots somebody it's practically like shooting a stormtrooper
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.740]  I mean, it's like, you know, like the squib
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:07.220]  the squib in the chest was just like a puff of smoke and the guy just you know falls into
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:11.380]  You know sharks with lasers pit
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:22.260]  Whereas I think the more visceral violence in the more recent ones like the Craig ones, you know is a little different. Oh
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:27.700]  My gosh. Oh, no. No. No, I mean a lot different. Yeah. Yeah, I mean
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.580]  I'm starting if it's a beef jerky. I thought I could pull it off. Um
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:32.580]  Hmm
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:38.260]  How's it going what do you think about what do you think about the actual ratings
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:42.340]  I I still think it was a mistake to introduce the rating pg-13
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:44.740]  um, I
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.780]  Find it
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:51.820]  Well, it certainly was easier at one time to understand everybody knew what our rated meant our rate event
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.540]  You could expect some some serious nudity and simulated sex
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:03.260]  You could expect some shits and fucks and you could expect real smoking and drugs and you know French connection
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.740]  That's an R-rated movie. That was easy to understand now when I'd like to per that article I
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:09.940]  110th read today
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:13.100]  1984 comes along you've got was a Temple of Doom. No
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:18.600]  Yep, Temple of Doom and gremlins were two movies that people were just like this is just now gremlins
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.440]  I think I could see gremlins freaking my kid out personally. It's so it's kind of a weird movie
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:30.120]  Yeah, it is a weird movie. We just rewatched it and not recently but maybe like last Christmas cuz it's sort of a Christmas movie
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.160]  Yeah, like about a year ago, but even even something like a movie we all love
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:41.520]  It's they take a movie like Groundhog Day if Groundhog Day had just the smallest bit of editing
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.180]  It would be maybe a canonical family movie
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.900]  It's so close to being a Ghostbusters. You know how much nookie there is in Ghostbusters. You got a fake blowjob
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.900]  You got remember that
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.900]  Remember that where Dan Aykroyd gets the ghost blowjob
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:00.380]  And it's like what's this doing in this movie?
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:07.820]  It's a movie for kids or just you know, and there's all these movies. This is still true today
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:09.300]  I know with the Marvel movies
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:15.180]  They're usually pretty good with the salty language until like the last act and that's when all the the shits and fucks come out is
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:20.220]  Always like the what is the rule isn't there kind of like a standard for how many you're allowed in a pg-13 movie?
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:25.400]  Yeah, I think there's some kind of and I think they'd like to really load them up in the back tip for when the closing
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.180]  Action, but I'm just saying like that's the part that's perplexing
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:31.940]  Is there like are you gonna tell me Ghostbusters is not right for kids? Oh, here we go back to the future
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:38.240]  Like there's some stuff in back back to the future is a great a great family movie that still has some stuff in it
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.240]  That's a little edgy. I
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.260]  Mean, you know, he's in his underwear. I guess that's not a big deal. But you know, it's straight Oh home alone
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:49.140]  I mean, would you come on? That's a kid's movie, right? Yeah, we've watched him
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:51.140]  Yeah, he gets an iron in the face
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.980]  That's that's worse than Wolverine, I don't know I
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.220]  Don't know I don't know the violence and home alone is kind of weird because it's on the one hand
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:07.820]  It's like they're kind of going for that Three Stooges thing. And on the other hand, there's like actual acid like
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:12.200]  Walking up the steps in bare feet and you see the nail
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:16.900]  Sticking out of the step and you're like, this is the most horrific thing that I've ever seen
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:20.820]  He's because every kid's terrified your parents get you terrified about getting tetanus from a nail, right?
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:25.200]  And he steps on in like a three inch exposed like nail
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.980]  right it in us
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.480]  it's an interesting movie because it
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.220]  it does though, but like his
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.500]  What's his name Kevin young Kevin's mastery of these two buffoon?
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.620]  criminals is
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:45.660]  Established cinematically such that you kind of get the sense that the kids gonna come out on top
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:52.940]  That he's you know, and that therefore his his mastery of of these two criminals the way that he prolongs their stuff
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:58.500]  It really does kind of in a sense. It's a little bit more like torture than it is. It's like grand guignol
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:05.860]  It's it's like he's deliberately making this as awful as he can. Yeah, it's less self-defense and more torture. He's kind of enjoy. Oh
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:11.660]  Man actually, I think there's a couple of scenes where like one of his you know
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:16.500]  Traps works and he just flat-out like high-fives himself. Yes, that's right
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:20.460]  Gotta pick that up which does the like her fist out and pumps it in good. Yes
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.660]  Fuller go easy on the Pepsi. I
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:26.500]  love
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.660]  But I don't know. I'm just saying okay. Now, how about this? All right PG 13
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:37.620]  So they I think it was a mistake because I think that the old way was G. That's a kids movie. That's for everybody
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.300]  PG is
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.100]  it's
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.300]  in between and R is for adults and doesn't matter why it doesn't matter if it's
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:51.100]  PG says it all PG PG says like your mileage may vary like yeah, you know
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:55.140]  it basically it almost kind of says like you need to
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.140]  Like watch this before your kids do
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:02.300]  Practical or like or like be advised right? Yeah be advised think about it
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:08.820]  You know if your kid is younger and if your kid is over 10, it's probably probably good. Yeah, you know, yeah
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:11.500]  I don't know but it's again that could to me the hard part is this sensitive
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:14.380]  I sent you a link to this website that I look at a lot and I
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:19.580]  I'm somewhat ambivalent about it. And yet I find it extremely useful. I cannot believe I'm saying this
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.820]  Have you seen that I said you should look at that link kids kids in mind
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:26.420]  Yeah, it's a very interesting idea because they go out and they review these movies, but it's very funny
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.620]  so the none of it is they come up with this these three like
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:39.820]  Mmm, three numbers not numerals because there's a ten but how much sex and nudity nudity is there from zero to ten?
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:43.620]  How much violence and gore from zero to ten how much profanity from zero to ten?
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.340]  Which I think it's it's a great like, you know, at least a fast glance where I mean
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:49.500]  Sometimes I use this to go like, okay
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:54.620]  We're thinking about these two different movies like which one of these looks better on the face of it and sometimes you know
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.180]  What I mean, it's a quick sniff test
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:59.100]  But then did you go in and look at the actual page?
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:01.260]  at like how
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.620]  It's like porn where they describe all the stuff that's actually in it
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:10.700]  No, I didn't I'm looking at sponge sponge and the way they describe it. It's hilarious. I want to meet the person who writes this
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:16.220]  Sponge Bob movie which I absolutely do not want to see sex and nudity you get it, too
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:21.340]  we see many human men on the beach with bare chests many women wear skimpy bikinis and reveal cleavage a
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:27.300]  Sponge accidentally pulls the shorts partially down from a starfish is waste and we see the upper buttocks and buttock cleavage
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:33.940]  I've got one here from Mordecai a husband and his wife attempt to kiss several times in different scenes
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.900]  but his moustache makes her gag and
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:44.980]  He gags in reflex. Oh my god, please see the violence and gore category for more details on the gagging
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.100]  It's but it doesn't it read like something like a Japanese man would buy for porn
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:56.940]  American sniper profanity gets a 10 about a hundred and fifteen f-words and its derivatives 10 sexual references 32 scatological terms
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:04.760]  20 anatomical terms 12 mild obscenities name-calling including sunshine quitter nuts old man hotbox arrogant self-centered sitting ducks legend
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:10.260]  See why why can't somebody wrote all those down John? Why count all?
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:12.740]  115 fucks, you know because
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.420]  Clearly, I mean, how long is the movie it even if it's three hours, right?
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:19.500]  Right, you're you're on the two hours two hours and 12 minutes
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.020]  So it's roughly one a minute
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:28.460]  Yeah, fuck a minute, right? And unless there's like a burst at
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.960]  Had the end it's you know
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.320]  I think you only have to go about two or three movies or minutes into this movie and you can just check off 10 on
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.520]  The profanity some of these. Oh my god
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.740]  All right, it's like this like you're if you're like the inspector for a hotel
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:47.460]  Like you don't have to count the bug like once you see five rats in the lobby
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:52.580]  Yeah, new dealers check that off. You just check it off. You don't have to count them, right?
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:54.540]  You don't have to count them
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:57.400]  1998 film a lot of people a lot of families have enjoyed called The Big Lebowski
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:01.980]  Profanity they give it a 10 about 240 f-words
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:10.160]  Many scatological references many anatomical references many mild obscenities here to fix Dinah Kabul
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:17.100]  This is great. I I I love this but I know that I'm gonna lose a lot of time on this site
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:20.220]  Like oh, I know and but the things I can't show it to my wife
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.820]  Oh, I mean, I'm gonna say can't she's a grown-ass woman
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:26.700]  But you know, it makes it when you read when you read it in this clinical way
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.120]  It makes it sound so much worse when they say a starfish is
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:38.160]  Swimsuit is pulled down and reveals buttocks guys. That's Patrick. It's Patrick's but he's a goddamn cartoon character. It's okay if we see his butt
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.580]  All right. I looked up
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:44.980]  Fantastic. Mr. Fox which is actually I was just talking to do I just watched it. I love it so much
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:46.860]  I
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:51.220]  Cut key called it. Oh, I when I linked to a picture from it and he said it's underrated
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.820]  I think it's my favorite Wes Anderson
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:58.020]  It's it's it's one of my all-time favorite movies let alone one of our families like there's two movies
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.440]  Yeah, if we can't decide on anything and it comes to blows it's either The Incredibles or mr. Fox. That's it. Yeah, that's
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.740]  Those are yeah, those are two good ones to leave at the top of the queue. All right, so
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:17.120]  For sex and nudity, it's only ranked a one out of ten which meshes with my memory
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:21.180]  Here's what we've got. We've got Christopher sin in a swimsuit
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.680]  Husband and a wife kissing Fox kissing hug a teen boy and a teen girl
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:33.560]  Fox flirt in a couple of scenes. I do remember that you're supposed to be my lab partner. I know it number
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.560]  No, you're not you're disloyal
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:41.340]  Or number two a rat refers to a fox's wife as the quote town tart
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:49.600]  Right, I yeah, I never off a fox wife tells her Fox husband that she is pregnant
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.780]  So that gets counts for a one on the sex nudity skin while they're in a cage. Oh
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.420]  Man
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.020]  Yeah, but again, you know what this is though
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:47:59.260]  Okay
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:04.500]  So I just gotta say this is this is actually really helpful though because like you say this is the rats in the lobby title
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.740]  It's like you can see like oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no big Lebowski's not gonna be great to watch with the kids
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.740]  Am I wrong? No, we're gonna skip this one
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:16.940]  But it is also good that you can go through and look for like the truth is like a trigger for your kids
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:23.240]  27 exclamation. This is for profanity 27 exclamations. What the cuss cuss words
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.060]  What the cuss?
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.420]  They count that as a cuss word. Yeah cuss is a cuss word
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:34.420]  cluster cuss
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:37.780]  Mmm, they have a
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.740]  scatological terms
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.180]  glossary
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:47.020]  You get f-word derivatives, which all have little asterisks in them scatological terms religious profanities
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.660]  Mild obscenities friggin would be would be counted as a mild obscenity. All right derogatory terms
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:58.620]  Wow, but you know, I still I gotta say no. No, let me ask you if you remember this. Do you remember?
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:06.940]  I'm gonna say circa mid to late 90s. Do you remember a service that was actually kind of like what became Netflix?
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:14.180]  Where you could get edited movies, I think it might have been a somewhat overtly Christian place
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:20.100]  But you could get like a PG movie that had all of the stuff a certain kind of religious person would find offensive cut out
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.660]  I remember that I do. I do remember hearing about I remember hearing about it
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:27.420]  I don't I don't know where it went or what it did. But isn't that especially on the digital age?
[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:29.220]  It's a very interesting idea
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:31.980]  Yeah, cuz it would be you know, you could do it without losing fidelity
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.500]  Just you need just some basic metadata on like well, you know, you could go in
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500]  It'd be so great because if you could go in and say
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:42.860]  You know what? My family is observant and we don't want any god-dams. Could you
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:48.540]  Adjust with audio blip out the god-dams but leave in the horrific violence or whatever
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:52.160]  Let's say you want to show your kids passion of the Christ. Let's go see my passion of the Christ looks like
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.620]  But you know what? I mean because I gotta say I might find that
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:02.460]  It kind of goes against my some of my values about you know censorship or something, but that's what I'm asking for
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:06.780]  You know, there are some movies. I am much more likely to have my daughter watching a hotel room
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:11.260]  Because I know they've been you know edited down they've taken out the really cool
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:18.620]  We watched Highlander in a hotel room and she thought was a riot. I would never show that to her at home unedited. I
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:21.960]  Never thought about that about looking for a hotel edit
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:28.580]  The director's cut and then there's Hilton's cut. Wow. This is an unusual
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:34.140]  Unusual statistical spread on passion of the Christ sex and nudity. It gets a one
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.300]  Profanity it gets a one balance and gore
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:40.540]  Full ten. Oh my good
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.660]  Let her dance dance let her dance dance
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:54.900]  I've been now I'm looking for movies that I have let Jonas see that they don't even bother to list because it'd be so inappropriate
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:02.660]  Right. The Shining is not listed. Oh, come on. Are you kidding me that I've let him see it? Yeah. Yeah
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:06.020]  I think that's the only Kubrick movie. He's here Batman
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.020]  Wow
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.400]  She's never seen any
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.360]  Kubrick that was recent though. That was within okay. Yeah. Well, I think it was like less
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.580]  You're gonna say the clockwork orange till he's like 12 probably right?
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:24.080]  Yeah, a clockwork orange is gonna have to wait. Mm-hmm. Cuz yeah, but there are some things. Oh, I got oh, you know what?
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:25.640]  I'm gonna tell you I'll tell you more offline
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:31.960]  But there's a movie that she has been dying to see for like a year and we've read some of the book
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.080]  We've taught I've told her the entire story
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:35.800]  She
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.800]  really wants to see Hunger Games and I'm like
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:46.240]  It's seven like that's it just and again why too much personal violence like that the violence in Hunger Games
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.040]  I I'm gonna tell you I don't care. I'm 48 year old man. I'm gonna say it. I love the Hunger Games
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.320]  I thought it was a great movie. I thought it was a lot of fun
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:57.800]  I thought was very well done and I I just I really liked it and I cannot wait
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.400]  It's one of those movies like that. I'm constantly saying to her. Oh, honey
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.080]  I cannot wait until you're old enough to watch this with me like that one Blade Runner
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.720]  What about Blade Runner he's in Blade Runner
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:12.500]  No, yeah, that's pretty about that. Yeah
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:19.560]  Huh? There's the the Daryl Hannah got the I you got the you got the replicants doing some pretty bad
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.880]  Oh, you got Leon you got Leon
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:27.320]  There's some pretty bad stuff in that. I would probably let him watch it now though. He's 11. I would probably let him
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.120]  Yeah, I'm worried. How much how much did they play up that Daryl Hannah is a prostitute?
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:39.160]  Little okay, you afraid it's gonna be imitated behavior. Well, I don't know
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:41.360]  He's gonna want to go and get a skin job if you know what I mean
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:46.400]  Yeah, but I just say only only within like the last year or so. Oh sure. Sure. Sure. It's probably yeah
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.500]  That's what was Blade Runner rated. I must have been right. I think it's got to be rated R. Yeah
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.720]  Yeah, some of them are amazing. I'm telling you
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:57.600]  There's something about 80s movies that seems completely random movies that in my head
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:03.640]  I think of as being like maybe because I saw them when I was a young teenager like I'm so blown away
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:06.320]  There's just be boobs out of nowhere in the movie. Whoa
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.180]  We just watched over Christmas. We watched weekend at Bernie's
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:22.140]  And he loved it he absolutely loved it, but there were a couple of surprising 80s sort of boobies
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.780]  Yeah, I don't know how else to describe
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:29.540]  Well in those and the thing was that it was so egregious. I think a lot of the movies I'm thinking of it was by
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.540]  the time you had
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:34.340]  Theatrical
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.340]  You know VHS or beta
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:42.980]  cable and certainly get it ready for distribution on TV and if you think about something like caddyshack or you think about
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:45.180]  cash like obviously way too much but
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.940]  Can't wait till I can watch that with her but same here. Oh my god
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.900]  I love it. We thought about it
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:53.700]  We thought about it and then we were like running it through our heads and there's so much of it
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:59.240]  That's good. But that you know, I appreciate it more later. I should have seen I showed her Carl finding the candy bar in the pool
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:04.100]  I I don't know what we're gonna have to talk about what abortion is, but it's not gonna be
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.620]  Okay, so that waitress has a baby
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:16.460]  But wasn't gonna say about oh so so but it was funny though cuz like I think about like how like egregious and
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:20.860]  Unnecessary so many of the boobies are where like you could tell they made it to be easy to cut out
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.900]  We're just like hey, it's a shot of a girl taking her shirt off
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.100]  You're like, what was that?
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.400]  But like you had to have that in every 80s movie early 80s movie think about like stripes, you know
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.260]  I mean there's these movies that are like kind of mostly okay in some ways but then are like super inappropriate in other ways
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:39.820]  But yeah, there's got to be there's had to be like a scene where there were
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:46.740]  23 year old like having a pillow fight at a party. Yeah with feathered hair and they were either getting a hose down or having a
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.740]  pillow fight
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.660]  Well
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:57.740]  An awful lot of actresses got hosed down or suds up in in
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:59.700]  in completely
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:04.300]  Mainstream Hollywood movies in the 1980s. Let's have a car wash to save the orphanage
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:09.140]  But there's no orphanage in the plot. Sponges are soft, right?
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.820]  So what are we gonna tell people? How do we help people with this John?
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:17.820]  There are new parents out there people are having babies like crazy people. How do we help people with this? I
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:23.140]  Don't know I feel like you I feel like you got to have faith in your kid
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:28.860]  I feel like because I don't know I just remember when I was a kid when I was not allowed to watch certain movies
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:35.460]  It was a constant source of frustration for me. And you felt didn't you feel like a pariah? I did and we had
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:39.380]  A neighborhood movie theater and it was so great
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:42.220]  I think I had to have talked about this on the show at some point
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:47.260]  But it's probably years ago probably with like Dan but and it was I didn't even have to cross the street
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:51.420]  It was cata corner like a dad like up and around the block from my parents house
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.420]  so I didn't even have to cross the street and
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:59.260]  it was called the Majestic and it was an old time like vaudeville theater that at some point in the
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.460]  40s or 50s was turned into a movie theater and
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.060]  It was like connected to the fire company
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:10.360]  so like half the building was fire trucks the other half was a movie theater and it was just right out of
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:15.660]  Central casting of like old time matinee movie theater
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:21.020]  Velvet seats Wow had a balcony a big balcony
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:27.500]  Like you would go around the side and it was run by a family the guy who owned it was mr
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:32.540]  Dieter Dieter Dietrich Dieter, I think and he is probably around 50 and
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:38.000]  His dad was the projectionist and the ticket taker at the front door his dad
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:40.460]  He must have been
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:45.940]  75 but in it to our eyes as like eight nine-year-olds. He was ancient. He was like older than God
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:48.500]  You know, he was he was he was older than the earth
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:51.820]  And
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:57.420]  Then the kids his like ne'er-do-well teenage son would sometimes be working and it was such a great place
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.780]  Oh, how could you could you sometimes get away with it?
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:00.540]  well
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:05.960]  What you could sometimes get away with is if the kid was behind hit they had great popcorn like the best popcorn in the universe
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:11.180]  And they had because it was like a little, you know a little movie theater
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:15.960]  They never got movies when they were new they got movies right after they were new. So like
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:20.700]  Empire Strikes Back would come out and it would play for three months at the multiplex
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:25.760]  All right, and then the majestic would get it for like, you know, however many weeks they wanted
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:31.540]  And they would sometimes have like two movies at the same time even though that was just you know
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:36.580]  It wasn't a multiplex one screen but like in the afternoon, they might show like a kids movie like Peter Pan
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:40.500]  And then at nighttime there was a you know, John Travolta movie or something, right? I don't know
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:44.140]  And they would also show
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:47.860]  Rock movies like concert films from like movies kind of things
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.100]  Yeah
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:53.180]  like though I like just concert movies of like the stones and Led Zeppelin and stuff like that and my parents always get mad cuz
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:57.860]  When they showed those like our backyard would get trashed like it's like kids coming out of movie
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:04.340]  They were like cut through like and and you know leave beer cans and stuff, but it was such a great place
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:06.340]  But I remember we used to go as a kid any
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:12.820]  Saturday where it was if it was winter or if it was rainy or whatever we would just go to the majestic
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:16.060]  We would just go that because it was like a dollar a dollar matinee your parent
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:19.780]  My mom wouldn't mind giving you the money you'd be out of their hair, but every once in a while
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:25.500]  I remember one time specifically I wasn't allowed all my friends were going and they didn't give it like one thing about mr
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.760]  Dieters, he didn't give two shits how old you were if you had your dollar you could go see
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.860]  So that the Saturday matinee was kujo
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:37.060]  This is my this whole story is my I was saying I was not allowed my mom checked and I knew she wouldn't let me
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:40.820]  See it. So I hope I just said can I go to the majestic and she said what's playing?
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:42.820]  I said, I don't know she goes. Well, let me look
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:48.840]  And she looks you know in the newspaper, of course, and there it is kujo rated R and now she could tell you
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:53.820]  Well, I don't know. I can't remember if I got because you would just sometimes go and see what's there
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:57.940]  Yeah, and we would often go if they had the same movie two weeks in a row
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:01.020]  We'd go see it twice in a row and if we if we sat in the balcony last time
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:04.620]  We'll sit up in the front row this time and you know half the time on the balcony
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:09.500]  We would just sit up there and throw popcorn on teenagers who were making out down below, you know in the back
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:16.300]  They're like little kids up in the front row little kids on the balcony and then like teenagers making out and like the back row
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:18.300]  We would like try to throw popcorn on them. Oh
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:23.140]  Oh the great thing they had video games in the lobby, you know coin up
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:27.200]  Like a little mini arcade in the lobby and you could play them
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.340]  And you know, so I said that the old man's dad was the projectionist
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:36.740]  Well, the projection booth was up in the balcony and it took him I swear no joke like five minutes to walk up the steps
[01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:42.300]  Like he was seriously all and he would he was so old that he would take the steps like left foot
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.940]  And then the right foot would be in the same step. Oh, no, but right foot
[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.660]  So it was like a last call for video games
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:53.940]  Like when his dad started going up the steps, you knew you had time for you could you could still get one more game in
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:01.420]  Without missing what a place but I couldn't get into I couldn't get in to see Kujo and I remember Blue Lagoon
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:03.420]  I remember missing out on the Blue Lagoon
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.540]  I remember seeing that on cable Oh brother
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:12.260]  But all my friends my friends parents just did my they just didn't check. I think I don't think anybody's I
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:16.900]  I was probably around eight or nine at the time. I don't think anybody in their right mind would let their eight or nine year
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.900]  old see Kujo
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:22.860]  But here's the thing too, I remember thinking I would be fine
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:28.880]  I was not I've never once was upset by a movie in my entire life as a kid. I was you know, I think
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:35.220]  Pretty naturally mature I could have I and my friends saw Kujo and they were fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:40.980]  Including my friend Dave who is the kid who got freaked out by Raiders of the Lost Ark
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:46.860]  He went to see Kujo thought it was a cool movie. Yeah, if you know what you're in for, you know, yeah
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:52.940]  Never tell my Blade Runner story. No, I hung out with older kids a lot of the time and I went back
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.900]  From Florida to visit my friends in Ohio
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:01.980]  Whatever that summer was some Blade Runner was out and they were all older than me and they could pass and I look like I
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:07.300]  Was four and I'm just never forget we walk up there and they buy their tickets in my hand of God
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:11.380]  I walked up to the counter. I think I was holding an unlit cigarette. Maybe they'd given me
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.500]  I woke up to the counter and I go one adult for Blade Runner
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.300]  How old are you I was 13 and like really one adult
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:26.260]  Superman to
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:32.900]  Did you ever do that as a teenager like like in your in your like teenage years
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:36.340]  Did you ever do the thing where you'd buy a ticket for one that you know?
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:42.060]  They'd sell you and then try to sneak in to I never that never occurred to me. It's such that's such a smart trick
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:46.500]  I was scared to do anything. I was always scared to buy beer. I was scared to go to R-rated movies
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:49.300]  I was just I was so I was such a good kid
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:56.780]  I you know like a good kid like I did not want to disappoint anybody in authority. I was scared. I was scared now
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:00.420]  I was a scammer like the rise of the multiplex and then like
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:05.460]  Once I was old enough those things that the whole point is those things make money because they're so understaffed
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.240]  They got like one kid that walks around and sweeps up popcorn once a day
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.140]  No one's paying the attention to who's going in those theaters you go and sit somewhere near an adult. You're good to go
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:17.980]  Yeah, like I think a bunch of Schwarzenegger's 80s movies for R-rated. Oh, yeah
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:23.340]  You know, it's all those. It's just always shooting people up and blowing things up
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:24.260]  But we'd go you know
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:28.540]  We would just go and buy tickets for I don't know whatever we thought we could get into and you can always sneak in
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:32.400]  There was just always one guy like who would make sure you had a ticket
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:39.060]  There is no money in pursuing that no, I mean there's money in running and selling, you know goobers and popcorn
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:48.020]  There's no money in monitoring those theaters. I remember one time my friend Ethan and I went to a multiplex to I
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:52.500]  Forget was there girls involved there might have it might it wasn't a date because I
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.220]  Wasn't you know wasn't lucky enough to have dates, but it might have been like us
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:58.520]  It was like a teenage situation over there were girls
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.260]  involved and so I could kind of pretend like maybe it would be a day and
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:08.260]  We wanted to see an R-rated movie, but we were it was we weren't like 13 anymore. We were maybe more like
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.860]  15 or 16 and so we didn't think it'd be a problem
[02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:17.940]  and we asked for the R-rated movie and she said no, you know do you have ID and we're like
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:20.940]  No, and she was and she's like a 17th and we're like, of course
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:25.340]  And she's like, no you're not and then we're like, well give us two tickets for you know
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:31.740]  Whatever it was PG and she's like no. Oh no shit and with my friend. Ethan's brother had
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:36.420]  Had driven us and dropped us off nice enough. He was like two or three years older
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:39.140]  So he was like 17 or 18 and he hadn't gone yet
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:44.180]  He was still was there, you know, we ran and got him and he he bought us our ticket. Oh, you're kidding
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:47.880]  Yeah, he bought us to it, but it was like but I still don't know how that got around
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:51.700]  I have no I have no respect for people who buy beer for underage kids
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:57.940]  But people who buy I said the guy who drinks a lot but but but somebody buying movie tickets for kids. That's pretty cool
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:04.700]  Yeah, but I don't know why she fell for that. She wouldn't fall for our will just buy the PG but she somehow fell for
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:11.420]  I apparently once there's a 17 year old involved you can get anybody in there show the ID they they can't say anything
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:13.420]  That's the law, right?
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:19.220]  One adult I think we told her do that he was our parent
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:23.500]  Two years old walking in my dad holding holding a finger under your nose
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:27.180]  My dad says it's okay
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:32.140]  Blade Runner, I'll tell you what Blade Runner is a damn borderline movie for
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:37.980]  10 10 11, you know, there's again that that Hunger Games Die Hard
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.840]  There's so many movies where I'm like you so can't see this yet
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.660]  But I really I cannot wait till my kid can see Die Hard. Yeah, I remember
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:48.940]  My was not allowed to read
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:53.940]  The Catcher in the Rye and I don't even know why I wanted to at some point
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:56.740]  I'd you know, I had become a you know, a fairly
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:59.540]  avid reader and
[02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:05.740]  My mom, you know, definitely my mom encouraged it and you know would would I could buy books?
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:07.380]  We get books at library and at some point
[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:10.340]  I wanted to read The Catcher in the Rye because I'd heard it was a cool book or whatever and
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:14.620]  She thought about I could tell she was really thoughtful and she was like, you know, it's a great book
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:17.220]  I can't wait for you to read it, but you're not you're not old enough yet. And
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.460]  And I would ask like every six months. Can I read Catcher in the Rye?
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.940]  Can I read Catcher in the Rye and eventually she let me and I forget I don't know how old I was
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:28.380]  but you know, maybe like 12 or 13 and I read it and
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:34.740]  I was expecting it because it'd been so set up by her not allowing me to be like Lolita or something
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:39.900]  Yeah, I thought it was gonna be like and this is gonna be some great stuff. And I just remember being bored to tears
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:42.460]  I was like what the hell it's just a kid walking around
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:47.900]  So much more when I got older. Oh, yeah, you know what and I wish that's what my mom had said to me
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:53.260]  I wish she hadn't made she was thinking too much about some of the content and some of the ideas and I really really
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:55.020]  fundamentally it was more like
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:59.100]  You're you you shouldn't bother reading it. Now. You won't appreciate it, right?
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:05.700]  That's kind of the trade-off we were talking about it's a truly great book, but you're not ready for it yet
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:08.500]  Well, I'll give you and I'll tell you where I'm going with this is
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:13.260]  Movie wise it's actually rated G content wise. It's not that bad
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:18.060]  but I won't let Jonas watch 2001 right because I
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:21.980]  Strongly suspect he'll be bored to tears and I don't want him to get it
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:28.260]  I thought that this movie is polite or like or I mean watching the the ape stuff at the beginning going like oh that is so
[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:30.060]  fake I
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:34.660]  Wonder if you would think it's fake some of it some of the bag the the the staging that looks fake
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:39.540]  I think the apes themselves are still better than you'd expect. That's that's for sure. But no, I'm with you
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:44.380]  That would be something is kind of like me with James Bond and her like I was amazed that she could tolerate the pacing to
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:46.700]  Watch Goldfinger like three times now. It's it's crazy
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:54.660]  There really is a seat at Goldfinger where they just sit on a porch and drink mint julep just it goes on and on and
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:59.500]  Then they have some discussions about whether they should go in or let James Bond keep doing his thing James Bond's in the cell
[02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:00.780]  He's out of the cell
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:05.780]  He's in that he's in that he's in the world's craziest. He's hiding under the world's craziest rec room. My god
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:11.180]  What's the guy's name Kent not Ken Curtis? What's the guy's name Ken Adams? Oh my god that that room?
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:18.820]  I love that room so much and every time every time we watch it when Goldfinger leaves to go make his deal with the guy
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:22.980]  Who wants his money back? I always do the same stupid joke ago. Hey, we wanted to play billiards
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:28.500]  She laughs a little hey, I I should go I got to try to get to the strike cleaner
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:32.620]  But what are we gonna do to help people here? I I mean, what do you your mileage may vary? What do we say?
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:34.820]  What do we say? I don't I don't care about the people who think we're nuts
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:37.020]  But like well, what would you say as a good piece of advice?
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:42.980]  I would say one is if it's a movie you consider a classic you think your kid is almost ready for watch it yourself
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:47.780]  Yeah with them not there. Yeah, and also I would not be afraid to fast over
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:55.920]  Yeah, yeah pass pass forward fast over. Yeah. Yeah, you got to watch it with them. Yeah. Yeah
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:58.300]  That's what I think still gonna hold off on Die Hard though, I think
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:06.060]  We just got into Die Hard this year. We have this is the first year. This is a beautiful Christmas movie 10 10 years
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:08.560]  That's just about a perfect movie. Yeah, I don't know
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:12.860]  I don't know why I had it filed away as something he could watch when he was 10. Yeah. Yeah
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:16.260]  Well, thanks. Thanks for having me on man. It's always a pleasure. Oh
[02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:20.380]  It is we should just do this every week and not put it out
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:22.640]  No, when they'd be good for us to be good for us
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.120]  I think we should start our own version of this kids in mind and we'll do our own
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:31.480]  We'll do our own version. We're not gonna count the f-words. Yeah, just tell you if they swear. No, no, no
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.020]  We'll make love it
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:32.140]  No
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:36.020]  ours is our sites gonna be called rats in the lobby and we're just gonna let you know if you're if your kids
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.020]  Are real punk or pussy? Just skip it skip it
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:09:03.980]  Oh god, that's the end that's it
