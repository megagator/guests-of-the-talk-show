[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  Fashionably late as always. It's pretty good for me. Yeah eight minutes
[00:08.800 --> 00:11.140]  Because you guys do the live thing on ATP
[00:11.140 --> 00:15.680]  So you've got to be on time because people are sitting there and refresh on that on the website
[00:16.320 --> 00:18.320]  That's not why we're on time
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.800]  Why are you on time
[00:22.800 --> 00:24.800]  Self-respect, I guess
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.600]  Standards, right? We're East Coast people your East Coast person to be supposed to be representing for us instead
[00:30.600 --> 00:33.800]  You're you going to Las Vegas mode. I
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.640]  Don't think it's that bad, but it is sort of a West Coast personality trait
[00:39.160 --> 00:42.800]  now the West Coast move which is also your move is like
[00:43.960 --> 00:48.720]  Nine o'clock rolls around or whatever time we're doing and you realize oh, I forgot about that and you immediately
[00:48.720 --> 00:54.720]  A petition for a 15-minute delay and then you have a five-minute delay after the 15-minute delay
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.960]  Sorry
[00:58.960 --> 01:02.000]  Makes you endearing. Oh, you sound like you're in a good mood
[01:03.160 --> 01:05.800]  Yeah, sure. Sure. Why not busy week?
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.880]  So I finished listening to now probably an episode behind though because you guys probably recorded last night
[01:13.880 --> 01:19.280]  The context we we are recording right now. It's Thursday, October 23rd
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.840]  You guys probably did an ATP last night, but it's not out yet
[01:22.840 --> 01:28.160]  So I might be behind but I did listen to last week's show where you talked about your Yosemite review
[01:28.820 --> 01:36.140]  We talked more about it yesterday and yesterday's episode as well. So well, I'll try not to well if if we venture into
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.860]  Duplicating the same story territory. You can just interrupt me and say, you know what listen to ATP because I want to do
[01:40.860 --> 01:45.360]  You know, it's no use wasting people's time. I'll say the same things twice. I don't care like
[01:45.960 --> 01:48.900]  the thing with all podcasts is and you know, this is kind of like
[01:49.680 --> 01:54.540]  It's like a first draft over your thoughts are and you just kind of on the spot and then you start thinking about it
[01:54.540 --> 01:58.280]  and you start talking about it and you you know, at least I do I kind of ramble and it's like
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.700]  Given time to think about that like I think I could say that again better and then obviously the ultimate is you like
[02:03.700 --> 02:07.640]  Oh, if I'm actually gonna write it, I gotta actually figure out what I really think but just sort of you know
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.760]  Anyway, I'd duplication. I don't mind give me a second chance to get it right. Yeah, totally
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.600]  And in a big picture I was thinking about this
[02:16.600 --> 02:20.440]  I don't know why because I guess it's it's just the way that human mind works, but somehow
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.300]  10.10 feels like a milestone, you know, it's like 10 even though it's not you know
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.880]  It's actually the 11th major version and it's the 12th
[02:29.880 --> 02:35.100]  I guess that you've reviewed because you did the public beta how many how many Mac OS 10 reviews have you done?
[02:35.100 --> 02:42.340]  So so I did developer preview to develop a preview three developer preview for public beta and then all the releases and it was also
[02:42.340 --> 02:46.780]  One or two thrown in there. They weren't really reviews. They were just like random like hey
[02:46.780 --> 02:48.780]  I just went to Mac world and here's some more stuff
[02:48.780 --> 02:51.380]  You might want to know about aqua and you know
[02:51.380 --> 02:55.380]  But if you wanted to go by the releases, I started a DB too because uh, yeah
[02:55.380 --> 02:59.740]  And I don't remember what I think I played with DB one, but I definitely didn't write it up. Hmm
[03:01.620 --> 03:04.120]  So I've been thinking about this and you mentioned this on ATP
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.860]  I don't want to get all maudlin but there's a chance you're thinking that maybe this last one that you just published last week might
[03:08.860 --> 03:11.620]  Be the last one you're gonna do you may not do next year's
[03:12.340 --> 03:14.140]  yeah, I
[03:14.140 --> 03:15.940]  You know we can get into that a little bit later
[03:15.940 --> 03:21.260]  But you know just thinking and this nice even round ten number. I do think the
[03:22.020 --> 03:27.420]  podcasts in general and you having been doing one regularly either ATP or
[03:27.420 --> 03:32.620]  What was your old show called hypercritical
[03:36.660 --> 03:42.160]  It seems like forever but it's not like when did hypercritical start I think like 2011
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.920]  Yeah, so it's only a handful of years
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.540]  But to me there's this huge difference as you know, and you and I got to know each other
[03:48.540 --> 03:52.620]  I don't even know when we first started emailing but it was a long time before we met but we are at least
[03:53.060 --> 03:55.100]  Email before during fireball started
[03:55.100 --> 03:58.600]  Because you were working at you were still working. I've told this story in ATP
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.300]  You gave me my first copy of BB edit or whatever the current version
[04:03.300 --> 04:06.820]  It was out then like it previously I had convinced work to buy it for my work
[04:06.820 --> 04:11.020]  But you worked at bare-bones that here you go. Here's a free copy of BB edit. I was like, oh awesome
[04:12.060 --> 04:14.060]  No wonder I lasted there so long
[04:14.660 --> 04:16.660]  He's given away their software
[04:18.220 --> 04:20.220]  Surefire customers
[04:20.220 --> 04:26.380]  Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, we've known each other since before there was even during fireball and and it's you know
[04:26.860 --> 04:28.860]  our interests are
[04:29.540 --> 04:31.540]  common first name are
[04:32.100 --> 04:39.560]  You know the fact that we're I think we're exactly the same age even 1973 close. You're a year older. I don't look older though
[04:42.220 --> 04:46.340]  But I feel like the universe was that it was destined for us to know each other somehow
[04:46.340 --> 04:51.780]  Like it just seems like it it just seems like no matter what, you know how the dice had been rolled somewhere
[04:51.780 --> 04:54.900]  You know in the intervening years we were gonna get to know each other
[04:55.420 --> 04:59.540]  It was a small world back then like for the the Mac nerds on the web
[04:59.540 --> 05:02.660]  it was just like it was we were all using the ie5 and
[05:03.380 --> 05:05.740]  experimenting with CSS and reading Zeldman and
[05:06.220 --> 05:10.720]  Like hoping Apple doesn't go out of business and before that we're all reading, you know Mac week
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.140]  Which you talked about on the last podcast and and Mac user Mac world
[05:15.140 --> 05:16.780]  Like it was such a small world
[05:16.780 --> 05:21.260]  Like if we had if we'd both gone to the same Mac world conference, we probably would have bumped into yeah
[05:21.260 --> 05:26.100]  I think that's almost certain because it was it it was they were small back then or it was you know
[05:26.100 --> 05:31.020]  You you would inevitably meet everybody you wouldn't have that. Yeah, you would you would see the same people year after year
[05:31.700 --> 05:38.100]  It's not like WWDC where now it's like so crazy and you go and it's like some of your best friends
[05:38.100 --> 05:41.340]  you don't even see them you're like I didn't even I didn't even run into so-and-so and
[05:41.340 --> 05:44.260]  And it's just a very different world
[05:45.580 --> 05:51.900]  But as someone who's always been a huge fan of your work at ours these these massive book length reviews
[05:52.180 --> 05:54.180]  It's such a profound change
[05:55.380 --> 06:02.580]  Now that you're podcasting because it used to be that John Siracusa as a brand was something you got
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.180]  sporadically
[06:05.180 --> 06:08.540]  Almost like on an annual schedule you had to wait like a year in between
[06:08.540 --> 06:11.660]  But when you did it would be like a massive mainline dose
[06:13.820 --> 06:20.140]  And how different it is now that you have a weekly outlet and we all get plenty of John Siracusa
[06:20.580 --> 06:24.940]  It's so different. Yeah, and it's it's it's hard to imagine going back to that
[06:25.540 --> 06:29.580]  Yeah, I had for a while at ours when they were doing like staff blogs or whatever
[06:29.580 --> 06:34.260]  there was a period and I'm always surprised when I go back and look at it like there was a period where I was
[06:34.260 --> 06:38.980]  Blogging as if you want to call it that pretty regularly on the staff blog
[06:38.980 --> 06:41.940]  Like I'm amazed at the number of things I wrote there. I forget what I even wrote
[06:41.940 --> 06:45.380]  It's like, you know, it's not that the volume that you put out right on a regular basis
[06:45.380 --> 06:48.500]  But you know how it is where you can't remember what the hell you wrote because it's just too much, right?
[06:48.500 --> 06:54.300]  And I of course I remember all my reviews because those are big punctuated things and there's a few special stories in between there
[06:54.300 --> 06:57.740]  And retrospectives and I did like a game review and it's all sorts of crap, you know
[06:57.740 --> 07:03.340]  But I can remember those but then there was just like at one point I was doing one or two pagers every couple of weeks
[07:03.340 --> 07:08.860]  For ours and I look back on that body of work and I'm happy with it and I like it
[07:08.860 --> 07:13.380]  It's just that like it was never it was it wasn't it was neither fish nor fowl
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.940]  It wasn't what I do now
[07:14.940 --> 07:20.500]  Which is just sort of ramble on a weekly basis where it's just off the cuff or whatever and it certainly wasn't the big long
[07:20.500 --> 07:24.580]  Lead-up to a giant, you know review. It was kind of in between II and
[07:25.100 --> 07:31.260]  I guess podcasting has totally filled that role now because I don't have you know Twitter and plus podcasting have
[07:31.260 --> 07:36.020]  Destroyed my ability to blog not that I had much of an ability to do it to begin with
[07:36.020 --> 07:41.860]  But I I may get back into it if I don't do these big reviews anymore. Yeah, I'm not sure that you're meant for it
[07:41.860 --> 07:45.620]  I don't know. I feel like you've found your thing. That is more
[07:45.620 --> 07:50.580]  It's it's like I always say like to me in everything in life. It is a general rule
[07:50.580 --> 07:54.940]  It's the extremes where things are most interesting like to me like it daring fireball
[07:54.940 --> 07:59.780]  The best posts are my link list ones where I think of just one word to add or two words
[07:59.780 --> 08:01.780]  You know, good luck with that or something like that
[08:03.620 --> 08:10.420]  Or the big long ones the thousand multi-thousand word pieces it's when I have a post that's like
[08:11.260 --> 08:14.660]  300 words then I know I'm in trouble that I've you know
[08:14.660 --> 08:21.700]  I either should be able to make this point much more succinctly or I'm being lazy and I need to go deeper and I feel
[08:21.700 --> 08:25.500]  like with you it's it's you know, you've found your your your
[08:25.500 --> 08:30.180]  I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this format and it's podcasting
[08:31.060 --> 08:35.020]  It's not even that I could spend all the time where it's just sort of more like less prepared
[08:35.020 --> 08:40.020]  It's like more more thinking out loud and you know going back and forth and the the blog format
[08:40.020 --> 08:43.100]  Like if I didn't have an actual regular day job that took my time
[08:43.100 --> 08:47.820]  I think I the thing I like about that is not so much that any individual post is anything special
[08:47.820 --> 08:53.760]  But that you sort of build up a body of work with like little reference points like very frequently. I find myself
[08:53.760 --> 08:56.480]  thinking back that you know, I
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.240]  Wish I had something that I could point to about this and podcasting as you know
[09:01.240 --> 09:04.120]  It's harder to like it's harder to ask people to go
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.040]  Oh go back to this thing and like you have to give them a time stamp and you have to look it up and find
[09:08.040 --> 09:10.240]  Out where everything is. Whereas if I could just point to a blog post
[09:10.240 --> 09:16.460]  Oh, I talked about this specific issue in a one-pager and you can get my take on it there and individual one-pagers
[09:16.460 --> 09:21.540]  Yeah, not a big deal one or two pages. But now that there's you know, I have a few of them on hypercritical.co. I
[09:21.540 --> 09:26.500]  I I refer to them frequently and a lot of times I wish the things I had said and worked out on a podcast
[09:26.500 --> 09:29.580]  Like I mean you do the same thing and so does Marco depend, you know, you either
[09:30.340 --> 09:35.540]  write about it first and talk about it on a podcast or talk about it first and that becomes a post for your websites and
[09:35.940 --> 09:38.400]  I find it frustrating that I can't
[09:39.220 --> 09:45.380]  Point that like that podcasts are so invisible like they're they're ephemeral and you can't like point people into them
[09:45.380 --> 09:47.380]  It seems like asking more than just having them
[09:47.380 --> 09:51.500]  Read a paragraph or two on a web page that you send them. So I do wish I had
[09:52.140 --> 09:54.900]  More time to blog who knows if I even well, I don't know
[09:54.900 --> 09:59.400]  like I'm not not forcing myself to do it or whatever, but I think a lot of the reason that
[10:00.020 --> 10:04.780]  You know, this is kind of where the blogging tailed off once that the OS 10 releases started coming out yearly
[10:05.220 --> 10:09.980]  At first it was like there would just be a quiet period where I wouldn't write anything because I'm just doing the review and then
[10:09.980 --> 10:12.880]  That quiet period expanded to like fill the whole year and so it's like well
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.900]  I guess all I'm doing now is Twitter and worrying about writing my reviews. Yeah
[10:19.860 --> 10:21.860]  Well said
[10:23.780 --> 10:29.260]  How do you have you how many words was your Yosemite review I think I asked you this last year, too
[10:29.940 --> 10:34.060]  It's like the same you didn't read my about post because you follow too many people on Twitter
[10:34.060 --> 10:38.820]  It's like the same like this. It was last year. I can't look at the number. It's on like
[10:38.820 --> 10:42.600]  26 K 27 K something like that hyper. Is that a hyper critical?
[10:43.140 --> 10:48.200]  Yeah, is that a co co the calm guy wants too much money, man
[10:49.740 --> 10:57.020]  Well, so we get for the Vesper we got the dot-co somehow it reads right I like somehow there's top-level domains
[10:57.020 --> 11:02.640]  Are such a weird thing because a the whole thing is so gross and never should have been exposed to end users
[11:02.640 --> 11:04.640]  Anyway, it's like file name extensions
[11:05.420 --> 11:07.420]  but they've become part of
[11:07.420 --> 11:09.840]  You know are the world we live in
[11:11.180 --> 11:19.140]  Dot-com is just invisible right as somebody has whatever dot-com and you just it's like the the nothing domain even though getting a dot-com is
[11:19.540 --> 11:25.420]  Incredible incredibly difficult because everything I mean everything was taken by like the end of the 90s let alone in the intervening years
[11:25.940 --> 11:29.420]  something about dot-co which is for people who don't know it's
[11:30.180 --> 11:36.720]  The the nation Columbia's top-level domain it reads like dot-com and it's like you notice it
[11:36.720 --> 11:38.480]  I always notice it I always you know
[11:38.480 --> 11:44.780]  But it has that same effect of like you just accept it like that's why I couldn't even remember the hypercritical TLD
[11:45.340 --> 11:47.860]  It's kind of like a you know web 2.0
[11:47.860 --> 11:52.680]  We like flicker where you leave off the are kind of like calm where you leave off the M kind of
[11:53.220 --> 12:00.460]  Twee sort of precious. It's that version making it really. I just got it because you know all the other extensions for worse
[12:00.460 --> 12:06.700]  I'm gonna get that us you know dot business
[12:07.420 --> 12:12.780]  But plumbing whatever. They're so bad. I just I can't I can't believe some of those
[12:13.300 --> 12:18.020]  But anyway if you went to the site you'll see that this it's my like the format
[12:18.020 --> 12:21.280]  I've done for the past three years. It's just like a template and I just changed the numbers like mad libs
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.820]  And at the bottom their stats right so
[12:24.580 --> 12:28.940]  27,000 words what's the I think that it's like the average size of a
[12:28.940 --> 12:34.780]  novel is somewhere around 60,000 words give or take so it's you know it's truly book length and
[12:35.660 --> 12:40.060]  Yeah, the weird thing to me. Is that that my review settled in around this
[12:40.580 --> 12:45.540]  25 27 case size for the past like three or four not through any conscious effort of my own
[12:45.540 --> 12:47.260]  But it's just that's how it worked out. You know right
[12:47.260 --> 12:53.340]  it's you know like that's about how much work they can do on an annual basis on Mac OS 10 and
[12:53.340 --> 12:59.780]  It's like it's more like that's how much I feel like I can or should write because there's more
[12:59.780 --> 13:02.940]  I could write about and every time I always feel like I basically ran out of time
[13:02.940 --> 13:07.680]  And I would like to have whole giant sections, but I always like I prioritize them
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.720]  I say well yeah, I'm interested in that and I think I could write another few thousand words about it
[13:12.820 --> 13:17.700]  But would the value it adds to the review and the interested as you you'd be worth the time I put in
[13:18.180 --> 13:22.500]  You know and how much time I've got scheduled for this because really even though I have so much lead-up time to it
[13:22.500 --> 13:24.260]  It's still kind of compresses at the end
[13:24.260 --> 13:29.260]  There's only so much you can write about when things don't work and they're and they're broken in a beta and Apple hasn't made final
[13:29.260 --> 13:33.380]  Decisions you got a you know the final bits have to come down, and then you have to scramble hmm
[13:38.460 --> 13:40.700]  So if we added them all together
[13:41.580 --> 13:45.220]  What is it and I know that the sizes are different for some of the old ones?
[13:45.220 --> 13:50.340]  But it's it's about 15 reviews right if we're talking about this is the 11th numbered version
[13:50.340 --> 13:55.140]  And you did said you did dp2 dp3 dp4 so it's 14 or 15
[13:55.700 --> 13:57.700]  It's an enormous body of work
[13:57.700 --> 14:03.820]  It really truly is and I know that it's not one single piece of work that if you read them all back-to-back
[14:03.820 --> 14:05.820]  There's some sort of
[14:05.820 --> 14:08.860]  Repetition that would be going on because they follow a certain formula
[14:10.900 --> 14:13.860]  But I do think I think it's such as it's such an interesting
[14:14.500 --> 14:19.100]  Testimony to have and that like 20 years from now when when the youngins take over
[14:19.100 --> 14:24.620]  That they'll be out there for them to to look at and remember you know where things are
[14:25.100 --> 14:29.460]  That's what hope people like to think but young people won't give it to him. They already don't
[14:30.340 --> 14:37.860]  They'll look back on our great works and tremble right how often would we refer to a similarly detailed review of system?
[14:37.860 --> 14:39.860]  too from 1985 right or
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.740]  You know the Apple to OS or anything like that or you know yeah somewhere somebody would need it though
[14:45.740 --> 14:49.260]  Oh the thing that's brutal for me though is if I ever go back and look at those old ones
[14:49.260 --> 14:51.780]  I just I can't stand it. Just like it's terrible
[14:51.780 --> 14:54.340]  I mean, I don't know if you feel the same way, but like I go look at my early writing
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.500]  I'm like holy cow
[14:55.500 --> 15:01.900]  This is bad like just in bed in all ways like I guess I knew like it was it was certainly more casual back then
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.780]  and I was a worse writer and
[15:03.780 --> 15:09.580]  The combination of the two was just and really I don't know like you didn't know what was important
[15:09.580 --> 15:12.700]  and what wasn't the things I focused on or just seemed inane and I
[15:12.700 --> 15:17.500]  I have a lot of difficult a lot of people ask like oh you're gonna go back and collect all these together into one big
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.060]  Thing the most painful part of it would be that if I was to do that and you start reading it
[15:21.060 --> 15:26.820]  You're gonna start reading and from stuff. I wrote in 1999 that I think is not good. It's just not good I
[15:28.980 --> 15:32.300]  Mean like I hope I always feel that way I kind of you know I kind of feel that way like
[15:32.520 --> 15:34.580]  You know you get to a certain point
[15:34.580 --> 15:37.660]  And I just think everything I write is crap as soon as I write it and this you know
[15:37.660 --> 15:42.340]  I just make it as good as I can in time allotted and move on but it's like programming like if I don't if I
[15:42.340 --> 15:44.700]  Don't look back at the code. I'm writing this year like ten years from now
[15:44.700 --> 15:47.980]  If I don't look back at the code and writing this year and think it sucks. I have that means I'm not improved right
[15:47.980 --> 15:49.980]  I can totally see that I
[15:51.300 --> 15:54.020]  Look back I I did learn this and there's a
[15:54.620 --> 15:57.460]  I'm gonna I'm gonna get it wrong. I think it was
[15:58.700 --> 16:04.820]  It was one of the great Titans of modern computer science either Kern again or Richie or one of those you know Bell Labs guys
[16:04.820 --> 16:09.060]  who said something about the debugging is twice as hard as programming and
[16:09.060 --> 16:14.180]  So if you write code as cleverly as you possibly can
[16:14.700 --> 16:19.740]  You'll never be able to debug it because you'll need and then you know you need an intellect twice as great
[16:19.740 --> 16:23.120]  You need to you need to write your own code like like you're a halfwit
[16:23.340 --> 16:27.060]  So that when you debug it or when you write for me personally
[16:27.060 --> 16:30.260]  It's when I return to it that I can understand what the hell is going on
[16:30.740 --> 16:33.740]  Yeah, I know I know that saying and I understand the sentiment behind it
[16:33.740 --> 16:37.100]  But the logic in the same makes no sense and it's mostly BS in the details
[16:37.100 --> 16:42.020]  But in broad strokes trying to say the idea is that you know later
[16:42.020 --> 16:45.820]  You will come back to your own code and not understand it, and that is entirely true
[16:45.820 --> 16:52.660]  And so that what he's trying to say is to mitigate that don't try to don't make your life harder by doing things that are
[16:53.420 --> 17:01.020]  Difficult to understand even now when you're in the midst of right and it totally informed my use of comments is my comments
[17:01.020 --> 17:07.940]  I used to I used to only wrap course because I was a teenager and early 20s
[17:07.940 --> 17:10.300]  And so of course I didn't want to write any comments at all
[17:10.300 --> 17:13.820]  And I only did it because when like my CS professors
[17:13.820 --> 17:19.500]  You know you had to if you submitted your work without comments. It was something. You know you automatically lose like 10 points
[17:20.900 --> 17:27.580]  So I just the comments were stupid. I would just write you know the the the smartass teenagers comments, which is just
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.300]  restating the logic of each line and add one to write exactly
[17:33.020 --> 17:34.300]  whereas
[17:34.300 --> 17:40.420]  What like the light that went on even though I don't write much code anymore, but the the light that went on eventually was
[17:41.180 --> 17:48.840]  Comments are like time travel you're talking to your future self who is utterly confused as to why you would do this seeming
[17:49.060 --> 17:51.380]  There's this doesn't seem like it's necessary
[17:51.980 --> 17:53.220]  Tell your future self
[17:53.220 --> 17:58.820]  Here's why you're doing this and why you want to keep doing it, and it's made my code at least for my own self-maintenance
[17:58.820 --> 18:00.820]  It's made it all the difference in the world
[18:01.380 --> 18:04.680]  Yeah, there's a couple phases of that like the early phases everyone thinks
[18:04.680 --> 18:06.360]  I don't need comments because I'm writing this now
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.420]  And I understand and I understand in the future and the second phase is realizing
[18:09.460 --> 18:12.280]  That's not the case and you start trying to write comments
[18:12.280 --> 18:15.500]  But you don't know what good comments are and I think the third phase is
[18:15.960 --> 18:18.500]  Finally realizing that if you write the code in a sensible way
[18:18.500 --> 18:23.580]  You only need comments on the tricky parts and you should minimize that and when you do need a comment on the tricky part
[18:24.060 --> 18:27.700]  You know like how to write it in a way that will be illuminating rather than yeah
[18:27.700 --> 18:33.580]  Either the tricky part where you're doing something pretty clever and that it's it's you know a month goes by
[18:33.580 --> 18:37.940]  It's gonna be out of your head how you pulled that off because you're in the zone or for me a lot of times
[18:37.940 --> 18:39.580]  it's the
[18:39.580 --> 18:45.180]  You're working around something stupid and the workaround makes if you didn't know about the stupid thing
[18:45.180 --> 18:50.320]  The workaround looks like it's what you know, why would you ever do this? This is dumb. Just you know
[18:51.020 --> 18:52.620]  don't do that and
[18:52.620 --> 18:57.380]  Writing for your future self is easier than writing for other people because if you're in an organization where you're programming there's lots of
[18:57.380 --> 19:00.540]  Other programmers at the very least when you're writing for yourself
[19:00.540 --> 19:05.060]  You can you you can retrace your steps and you will arrive at the same conclusion again
[19:05.060 --> 19:09.800]  But other people won't do that because they react differently to the same stimulus basically
[19:09.800 --> 19:15.440]  So for other people what you're trying to do is you have ears as the one where you put the wise but also like
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.200]  What is the broader context of this whole thing? What is even going on here?
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.480]  Are there any assumptions that are unstated because you assume there are they're obvious to everybody but won't be obvious
[19:24.600 --> 19:29.640]  To someone a year from now and yeah, there's like writing comments is basically it's just basically writing
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.000]  Like it's the same you have to communicate to people in plain language with the reduced ambiguity
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.640]  Like it's different. It's a different goal a different purpose a different audience
[19:36.640 --> 19:40.680]  But it is writing and that's why programmers are so bad at it because those skill sets tend to
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.720]  Not cluster frequently where people who are happy and comfortable programming are not happy and comfortable writing prose
[19:47.280 --> 19:53.200]  Yeah, I guess it's true that a lot of times they're not but Sarah there seems to be I know I know it because we
[19:53.200 --> 19:55.880]  Have with Mac nerds worthy or the intersection of liberalize
[19:55.880 --> 20:02.160]  We know all the right, you know all the programmers who are good writers like Brett. Yeah, I mean Brent's a great example rich
[20:02.200 --> 20:05.520]  Yeah, no, I know. I mean do we all know we know people because you read their blog
[20:05.520 --> 20:08.120]  That's how we know Rich Segal is another great example, man
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.280]  when he doesn't write much but when he does it is so succinct and to the point and
[20:13.720 --> 20:17.320]  It's it's exquisite. Like I I often refer back
[20:17.320 --> 20:23.000]  I have a copy of the the BB edit 2.2 manual like the first public version of BB edit
[20:23.720 --> 20:30.640]  And it's it's just like a model of clarity. It is such a good piece of technical writing
[20:30.640 --> 20:36.440]  Did he write that one pretty? Well, I know he wrote parts and there was a couple of other credits up front
[20:36.440 --> 20:38.440]  But there's it and there's like a little
[20:38.680 --> 20:43.280]  What would you would call a blog post now? I sort of like why does BB edit exist?
[20:43.360 --> 20:47.960]  Why why why on the Mac would you you know want a programmer's text editor?
[20:48.720 --> 20:51.040]  Who would ever want to edit more than 32 K of text?
[20:52.760 --> 20:57.240]  It's more it's a more of like a personal statement like a mission statement for BB edit and
[20:57.240 --> 21:03.200]  It's just terrific I should actually see if he'd let me maybe I'd see if I can
[21:04.380 --> 21:08.640]  Rerun it or something. I think it would be an interesting especially now that BB at Eleven's out. Maybe I should
[21:09.200 --> 21:12.400]  See about getting it on the internet somewhere because I think it stands up
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.560]  Low these yeah, oh these many years in
[21:17.480 --> 21:19.480]  operating systems later
[21:19.960 --> 21:21.960]  All the stuff he writes if you've met him
[21:21.960 --> 21:28.520]  You can't help but read it always because very it's such a person the mannerisms and the pacing of the way
[21:28.520 --> 21:33.680]  He would say those things it comes through in the writing. I just saw somebody tweeted tweeted tweeted that the other day
[21:33.680 --> 21:37.200]  I don't know if it was to both me and you but to a couple of us where they were like now that we all
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.360]  Have podcasts they can't help but read everything we write in our own voices
[21:41.800 --> 21:46.400]  And I always hear that and I it's kind of nice because it means they're like listening to a lot of our podcast
[21:46.400 --> 21:49.520]  But I also kind of cringe because it's like God writing is where I get to be better
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.880]  And what the hell I speak I want to sound way smarter when I write because I got all this runway, and I could you know
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.400]  Speaking who knows what the hell comes out, but writing like that's my chance right and so it's almost a shame
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.400]  They know you know the the stumbling idiots that are behind the words like writing is a secret weapon
[22:05.400 --> 22:07.920]  I got all the time in the world to figure out what this sentence is gonna be yeah
[22:07.920 --> 22:12.840]  And there's no wasted words and no stupid yeah, well ideally I mean obviously like again
[22:12.840 --> 22:14.560]  That's the thing with longer views at a certain point
[22:14.560 --> 22:17.960]  I just got to be like that's that's the thing about these long reviews and all this stuff like
[22:17.960 --> 22:21.240]  Early on and still to this day in my OS 10 reviews
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.520]  I'm a slave to getting out whatever idea. It is in my head
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.960]  I have a point to make or something to say about something
[22:28.960 --> 22:32.480]  And I have like 17 points to make and 17 things to say about it
[22:32.480 --> 22:37.120]  And I want to get them all out and I sacrifice the quality of the writing many times
[22:37.440 --> 22:42.160]  Because I'm like this this could be said more elegantly in a different way
[22:42.160 --> 22:47.320]  But it wouldn't have this one extra little bit of nuance, and I talked to myself like what are you talking about?
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.560]  I'm like what do you care that that one like this point is sufficient?
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.080]  You don't need to go into this other detail
[22:52.080 --> 22:54.360]  I was like no I want it and so I make some awkward sentence
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.760]  and I put that other point in there, and it's I
[22:57.480 --> 22:59.720]  hate myself for doing it, but a lot of times. It's like
[23:00.520 --> 23:02.520]  the overriding thing is
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.700]  Say what I wanted to say and then secondarily try to say it in a reasonable way
[23:07.080 --> 23:11.680]  And that's not that's not the way to make good writing, but that's a lot of times what I do in my OS 10 reviews
[23:12.600 --> 23:16.120]  Let's take a break. I am going to thank our first sponsor
[23:16.120 --> 23:19.120]  Back for a second time. It's our good friends at
[23:20.200 --> 23:22.760]  Casper now you guys might remember from a
[23:23.680 --> 23:25.680]  few episodes ago, I think it was the one with
[23:26.360 --> 23:29.760]  Chockenberry, but Casper was a sponsor and had a great response
[23:30.720 --> 23:37.000]  Craziest idea I when I first heard this craziest idea in the world. It's you go online. It's high quality
[23:37.640 --> 23:41.320]  Mattresses like the ones you put on your bed at really really good prices
[23:41.320 --> 23:47.400]  Seems like a crazy thing to buy on the internet like but in terms eventually we're gonna buy everything on the internet
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.400]  We're gonna buy cars on the internet
[23:50.220 --> 23:56.000]  You go there they have it's it's two technologies they call it just the right sink just the right bounce
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.360]  It's two different technologies latex foam and memory foam that they put together. It's like a special combination
[24:03.960 --> 24:06.140]  That they've done just right you don't have to sit there
[24:06.140 --> 24:10.240]  There's not a whole bunch of different things you have to choose from they they they did it for us
[24:10.240 --> 24:13.760]  They're the mattress experts. They've designed a really good mattress
[24:14.600 --> 24:17.520]  I've had regular I've tried not I don't own one
[24:17.520 --> 24:23.580]  but I've tried a regular memory foam mattress before and I found them way too like weird the way that they they make an
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.520]  Indentation perfect for your body. It feels like I'm making a crime scene or something
[24:27.560 --> 24:31.640]  Their mattress isn't like that at all is just enough of that memory stuff that it's comfortable
[24:31.640 --> 24:34.160]  But it doesn't you don't feel like you're sinking into it
[24:34.160 --> 24:41.320]  Um, it's it's crazy. Did you get one of these John or did was it Casey who got it for ATP?
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.000]  Okay, so you got what we were thinking of getting one just because we know mattress period so they sent me one
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.100]  This is what they do when they sponsor a show they send one to you and it's like well, how does a mattress show up?
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.480]  Well, it shows up in like a little dorm room fridge style box very small
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.080]  You can't believe it, but it's because it's like two kinds of foam
[24:59.080 --> 25:05.280]  They like vacuum seal the mattress and it ships in what is still decidedly a very large package
[25:05.280 --> 25:07.920]  it is way smaller than a
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.960]  Mattress so put it in the room when you're gonna sleep in it then open the box
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.680]  They've got instructions that tell you exactly how to do it and let let it let it expand but it works
[25:19.680 --> 25:21.760]  It is absolutely amazing. It works. It's
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.720]  Feels like a great mattress. I really like it
[25:24.720 --> 25:30.200]  and the prices are so much less than the prices you pay for
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.240]  Mattresses out in the real world. It's ridiculous because the whole mattress industry is
[25:35.920 --> 25:41.760]  It's just that it's just like the Warby Park your story all over again where it's like it's like a cartel that come
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.660]  You know controls the whole industry
[25:43.660 --> 25:51.660]  They deliberately make it very very difficult to comparison shop across stores because each store even if it's from the same brand like Sealy
[25:51.660 --> 25:56.900]  They have like six different Sealy's the next store you go to has six different Sealy's and they all have different names
[25:57.220 --> 26:01.540]  even though they're technically the same mattress because they do this to make it really hard for you to
[26:01.740 --> 26:04.940]  Comparison shop and know whether you're paying a good price or not
[26:05.340 --> 26:09.700]  Casper cuts out all that crap and they just sell you great mattresses at a good price
[26:10.860 --> 26:13.720]  Typical price for a new mattress is well over 1,500 bucks
[26:14.240 --> 26:17.740]  Casper mattresses cost between 500. That's the twin size and
[26:17.740 --> 26:23.780]  nine hundred fifty for a king-size mattress nine hundred fifty bucks under a thousand dollars for a
[26:24.460 --> 26:27.580]  Top tier mattress you save hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[26:28.300 --> 26:32.020]  And it's completely risk-free. They have free delivery and
[26:32.740 --> 26:38.960]  Returns within a hundred day period so three months to sleep on the thing and if you don't like it
[26:39.300 --> 26:41.300]  They'll pay to send it back
[26:41.980 --> 26:43.980]  No idea how that works. I kept mine
[26:43.980 --> 26:50.620]  I'm not quite sure how how of sending the full-size mattress works, but they take care of it for you, and I believe it
[26:54.340 --> 27:00.100]  Risk-free. Oh and the last point I want to make I think this is great made in America made in America mattresses. So
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.500]  Where do you go to find out more apparently a whole bunch of you guys bought mattresses the last time their sponsorship brand?
[27:05.980 --> 27:09.100]  Totally encourage you if you need a new mattress check them out go to
[27:09.100 --> 27:12.740]  WWW dot Casper CASP ER
[27:13.460 --> 27:16.700]  sleep calm Casper sleep calm
[27:17.340 --> 27:19.340]  slash talk show
[27:20.620 --> 27:26.060]  Now use that code that talk show code and you will save 50 bucks off
[27:26.060 --> 27:31.340]  there are already low prices on any mattress that you buy so you'll save an extra 50 bucks and
[27:32.420 --> 27:38.700]  They're going to donate 50 bucks to a charity of my choice and that's I'll do the same charity
[27:38.700 --> 27:40.700]  I did the last time the food and allergy
[27:41.420 --> 27:43.260]  anaphylactic network
[27:43.260 --> 27:47.100]  That my son and wife raised a lot of money for food allergies for kids
[27:48.540 --> 27:56.460]  Great charity, that's all on them. Great mattresses go check them out at Casper sleep calm slash talk show
[27:59.060 --> 28:01.060]  Mattresses on the internet what the hell is next
[28:02.220 --> 28:05.980]  You know what else people are ready already buying cars in the internet. Yeah, I guess so
[28:05.980 --> 28:08.820]  I knew you can't buy new cars on the internet though. Can you I
[28:09.620 --> 28:11.620]  Think so, I don't know
[28:12.620 --> 28:17.360]  Speaking of big boxes showing up my iMac showed up today. So I started I ordered it
[28:18.300 --> 28:22.500]  Day one, so it must have been a week ago. Of course. I got a build to order
[28:23.020 --> 28:28.780]  and it said three to five days and they had a target ship date of the
[28:29.260 --> 28:34.660]  October 24th to 28 and I think it was a wide range because it was over a weekend
[28:34.660 --> 28:38.600]  I did pay I think it was like 30 bucks for expedited shipping
[28:38.700 --> 28:41.940]  So I checked last night before I went to bed and it said
[28:42.520 --> 28:47.220]  you know, I got a notice that my iMac was ready and it was in China and
[28:47.820 --> 28:51.900]  Then at 10 o'clock in the morning today my doorbell rang and it was here
[28:51.900 --> 28:57.860]  So from when I went to bed last night, it was in China and at 10 a.m. It was at my door, which is crazy
[28:57.860 --> 29:03.580]  I the magic of air trap. I can't help but think that when they told me it was in China
[29:03.580 --> 29:09.900]  It was already really over the Pacific but still it's kind of kind of astounding and a lot of people again
[29:09.900 --> 29:14.100]  There's I'm seeing everybody tweeting pictures of their boxes arriving. So first batch came quickly
[29:17.780 --> 29:20.220]  Everybody wants to know I guess I could talk about it. It's sort of thing
[29:20.220 --> 29:26.500]  I guess I would write a review eventually, but I don't buy Macs very often and then you even mention this on ATP
[29:26.500 --> 29:31.580]  like I just just now replaced a 2008 MacBook Pro that I had
[29:32.380 --> 29:37.500]  Upgraded to an SSD at some point which which gave it a couple more years of life, but it was really really
[29:38.260 --> 29:40.060]  aging
[29:40.060 --> 29:47.760]  And my desktop display as you know, it's it's it's like a 2004 20 inch cinema display
[29:48.460 --> 29:54.460]  Yeah, this is a serious, you know for as reckless as I am buying a new iPhone every single year
[29:54.460 --> 30:02.280]  I'm the opposite with Macs. I'd like to get one max it out and then use it until it's until it's ridiculously old
[30:02.940 --> 30:07.660]  now you're gonna find out if you have any glare in that room because I'm looking at the 23 inch version of that and
[30:07.660 --> 30:08.780]  It's matte and you know
[30:08.780 --> 30:12.900]  But you don't know if you have any serious glare issues if you've been using a matte screen for the past
[30:13.140 --> 30:17.460]  However, many years you'll find out now if you see your face when you sit down in front of you right now Mac
[30:17.460 --> 30:21.300]  Yeah, that was that's one of those things where I think they've gotten better at it
[30:21.300 --> 30:26.700]  And I know that it's and it's the sort of thing you can write about and they can advertise but you really have to see
[30:26.700 --> 30:31.580]  It the anti glare the thing that they've done with the new iPad air is pretty interesting
[30:31.580 --> 30:35.780]  But I want to know why didn't they do it to the new iMac too? Yeah, it's not it's not laminated
[30:35.780 --> 30:37.860]  Well, I think I think the reason that in laminate is you know
[30:37.860 --> 30:41.180]  I assume is maybe it's just too hard to laminate some of that big but you know
[30:41.180 --> 30:45.180]  You know how it is you take the glass off and then the screen is behind it if they laminated them together
[30:45.180 --> 30:50.640]  I guess you would like take the screen off when you opened it up and then you'd have to like disconnect the ribbon cables
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.820]  Or whatever it just maybe it would make it weird to disassemble. I don't know. But anyway, yeah
[30:54.820 --> 30:55.980]  It's definitely not laminated together
[30:55.980 --> 31:01.140]  And so you've got that air gap pushing increases the glare and also that's where the dust gets caught if you ever have to bring
[31:01.140 --> 31:05.620]  Another thing to get service. Yeah, those are two of two two pet peeves that you and I share together
[31:05.620 --> 31:09.300]  I do not like glare on my displays and I do not like
[31:09.940 --> 31:11.940]  machine noise
[31:12.500 --> 31:17.780]  So, I'm pretty pretty pretty satisfied that I'm pretty sure that it's gonna be I didn't take it out of the box yet
[31:17.780 --> 31:20.340]  I had too much to do today. So I did I wasn't even ready for it
[31:20.340 --> 31:25.740]  But I'm pretty pretty excited that it's not gonna be noisy. I'm a little worried about the glare
[31:26.180 --> 31:31.580]  I've kind of made my piece with the glare because I have the Apple 24 inch display at work
[31:31.580 --> 31:37.280]  You know the first one that was kind of like the iMac type screen where it's that that it looks like the Thunderbolt display
[31:37.280 --> 31:41.280]  But 24 inches and it was it predates it but it's got the same thing air gap
[31:41.700 --> 31:47.260]  And the screen and I'm in an office with you know fluorescent lights and also other things and there are reflection things
[31:47.260 --> 31:51.420]  But the compared to all of my co-workers displays which are like these Dell or Viewsonic
[31:52.140 --> 31:55.460]  Things or even like their their laptop displays and stuff
[31:55.860 --> 32:01.540]  Just the brightness and viewing angle like that the ridiculous brightness that these things have the LED backlit screens
[32:01.580 --> 32:03.900]  You never crank them up to the brightness in a regular house
[32:03.900 --> 32:06.140]  But in an office setting where just you know
[32:06.140 --> 32:11.620]  The fluorescent lights are everywhere and it's all super bright the ability to crank your screen up can really power through any other
[32:11.620 --> 32:17.380]  Sort of glare and it's just it's so much easier to see things in my screen than anybody who is around me
[32:17.380 --> 32:21.940]  I look at their screen so you can't see a thing because I mean because the viewing angles are bad because everything is so dim
[32:21.940 --> 32:23.940]  and muddy so
[32:24.180 --> 32:30.580]  There are advantages to this this type of design where it's just crystal clear piece of glass and a super bright screen behind it
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.860]  Worst case you can just crank it up again
[32:32.860 --> 32:33.060]  Of course
[32:33.060 --> 32:36.860]  My wife has a thunderbolt display right behind me and I look at that all the time that looks really nice, too
[32:36.860 --> 32:41.860]  So I'm I think I'm gonna be okay with the screen like the one you've got on your iMac if I ever get yeah
[32:41.860 --> 32:47.140]  And the other thing that makes me feel pretty good about it is I I'm okay with the glare on the current Mac books
[32:48.180 --> 32:53.220]  Like that least the retina one that I have now those are those are laminated to the are the most recent, right?
[32:53.220 --> 32:55.220]  I don't know. Maybe they are Oh
[32:55.420 --> 33:01.420]  Hmm, I think they are I think because I think that my first impression when they first had the retina 15-inch like back at
[33:01.500 --> 33:03.380]  WWC and we're looking to Jason snails or whatever
[33:03.380 --> 33:07.980]  It was like the colors were like up on the surface of the screen the same type of thing you got with the iPhone 4
[33:07.980 --> 33:11.060]  Right. Yeah, that's my game. Maybe maybe that's how they keep the
[33:11.820 --> 33:13.820]  whole lid so thin
[33:14.460 --> 33:17.040]  It's you know, seriously seriously thin
[33:17.780 --> 33:19.420]  Well, I still feel like that though
[33:19.420 --> 33:23.940]  I I remember when it was sort of a I don't know how many years it was
[33:23.940 --> 33:28.480]  I would say maybe in my mind it was around a three or four year period where
[33:28.480 --> 33:30.480]  There
[33:31.840 --> 33:35.320]  Was like this great divide between for laptops at least
[33:36.440 --> 33:42.640]  glossy and matte displays and Apple stuck with matte and the whole PC industry went glossy and
[33:43.440 --> 33:49.000]  Every time I go like in a Starbucks or something and I'd see people using, you know, Windows PCs
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.680]  I would just be flabbergasted at the how
[33:51.680 --> 33:58.840]  Like reflective their displays are and then Apple started offering. It was like a choice. I know
[33:59.840 --> 34:04.640]  Maybe the two or three years where we you'd when you'd buy a new, you know, it's probably the PowerBook era
[34:04.640 --> 34:06.440]  I guess there wasn't even MacBooks yet
[34:06.440 --> 34:12.840]  But you get a choice between matte and glossy and that's one of those things where I never hesitated for a second
[34:12.840 --> 34:14.840]  It was of course. I want Matt. I
[34:15.160 --> 34:16.780]  Think I question can remember this
[34:16.780 --> 34:22.440]  I know what the PC people did for their glossy ones is they didn't do what Apple has come to do now
[34:22.440 --> 34:23.800]  which is have a
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.320]  Clear piece of glass on top of an LCD screen
[34:28.320 --> 34:30.960]  I think maybe Apple's first glossy screens
[34:30.960 --> 34:37.880]  But certainly also the the PC glossy screens that sort of kicked off the thing were plasticky, but it was like super shiny plastic
[34:37.880 --> 34:41.440]  I don't know if was polycarbonate or something like that, but it had kind of like a
[34:41.440 --> 34:48.440]  Sticky wavy kind of look instead of what you get from a piece of glass, which is you know dead flat and like stiff
[34:48.440 --> 34:50.040]  you know what I mean and
[34:50.040 --> 34:56.840]  That made the screens look not only shiny but also cheap and I seem to recall Apple's first glossy displays being like that too
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.520]  And that's why it was like who in the world would ever want that
[34:59.520 --> 35:05.680]  It just looks awful when they switch to the big piece of glass a big heavy piece of glass and it made the lids heavier
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.640]  And it wasn't great and it was a huge air gap. At least that looked a little bit classier to me like more
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.840]  Johnny I would say more honest materials, you know, like when they finally sort of honed in. Oh, yeah aluminum and glass
[35:16.840 --> 35:18.760]  We're gonna do that for a few years
[35:18.760 --> 35:20.880]  That that settled things down a little bit
[35:20.880 --> 35:25.020]  But but even then and a lot of people who got the matte display just just for reflection reasons
[35:26.240 --> 35:28.240]  Yeah, I totally did
[35:29.680 --> 35:33.700]  It's just funny though that's that that used to be a thing and I'm still you know
[35:33.700 --> 35:38.320]  Because my display my desktop display is so ancient. I think it's literally 10 years old
[35:38.320 --> 35:45.960]  If I didn't buy it in 2004 it was soon after it's you know, it's like a relic I
[35:47.800 --> 35:49.800]  Have to say it was money well spent I
[35:50.920 --> 35:54.260]  Don't know how you stayed with 20 inch resolution for all because I die
[35:54.260 --> 35:59.160]  I feel myself just I wish I could get out of this 23 inch like 1920 by 1200
[35:59.160 --> 36:05.220]  I that's just like barely big enough to contain me, but I feel boxed in the I always I thought it was too small whole time
[36:05.220 --> 36:11.100]  But eventually eventually I got used to it and it you know
[36:12.820 --> 36:14.820]  It I don't know
[36:15.260 --> 36:20.180]  Did you pare down like your work environment where you like you don't have as many windows open as you would normally have and just
[36:20.180 --> 36:24.260]  Kind of try to go into like I'm just gonna have one central window with a text editor and then off to the sidewalk
[36:24.260 --> 36:29.100]  No web browser with a bunch of tabs and that's now I you know effectively I wrote it's with a 20 inch display
[36:29.100 --> 36:32.700]  It's a lot like using just a super size like the lunch tray
[36:32.700 --> 36:37.880]  Macbook, you know the seven city like you full screen not full screen
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.300]  But for the most part everything I'm working on is just in a stack of windows and they have to command tab between them
[36:42.300 --> 36:47.520]  There's not you know, it's not big enough to do a lot of side-by-side. So I'm really looking forward to the 27 inch
[36:48.040 --> 36:48.520]  Yeah
[36:48.520 --> 36:48.700]  No
[36:48.700 --> 36:49.260]  I have
[36:49.260 --> 36:55.000]  Over the many years honed by sort of like layering and positioning system for my windows which other people look at can make heads
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.240]  Or tails off but when I'm constrained and I start to have a lot of windows
[36:58.240 --> 37:01.920]  I start running out of places places for the corners to poke out like that's you know
[37:01.920 --> 37:04.600]  the system is like I've got I've got things in corners and
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.480]  Windows sized and shapes so that I can find a clickable region. That's just the way I work with max
[37:10.480 --> 37:12.480]  You know starting from the 80s
[37:12.800 --> 37:15.240]  But when I just have too many damn windows
[37:15.240 --> 37:20.560]  I run out of places to have clickable stuff and if I ever find myself I can do command tilde not command tab
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.160]  But command tilde within an app to cycle through the windows. I feel like I've been defeated by the lack of space
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.560]  So I really I really can't wait to get a 27 inch
[37:28.560 --> 37:31.160]  equivalent point resolution screen
[37:32.160 --> 37:33.440]  So I can't review it yet
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.880]  I literally didn't even take it out of the box but having seen it at first hand last week and I know a lot
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.800]  They're in the stores now too, and I've seen a lot of people who are at least going in to look at them. It's
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.160]  It's gorgeous. It really is. It's it's it. I I don't rush into it
[37:48.160 --> 37:55.040]  Like I said, I'm replacing at my desk at least six year old computer and a ten year old display, but it's it
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.080]  I didn't hesitate to buy it buy it on day one and I know you guys talked on ATP that it's risky because you know
[38:01.080 --> 38:02.560]  There's a lot of times
[38:02.560 --> 38:09.920]  First-generation stuff from Apple has kinks to be worked out image retention. Of course is a huge question mark at this point. I
[38:10.440 --> 38:16.600]  Think Jason said Jason Snell did Marco's little image retention test and said that his iMac
[38:16.600 --> 38:18.720]  Which he got already as well pass with flying color
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.080]  So seems clear on that front unless they're using two manufacturers and he got the right and it's in theory
[38:24.080 --> 38:30.560]  That's possible because Snell's is a review unit and they you know, I'm almost I don't know for a fact, but I'm
[38:31.440 --> 38:38.080]  99.99% sure that they sanity check the review units, you know that they they're they're not like factory sealed
[38:38.080 --> 38:41.940]  You know that there's a white glove guy who makes sure that everything that this is a good, you know
[38:41.940 --> 38:44.480]  There's no yours aren't factory sealed because I just got
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.360]  For the first time I got a bunch of loaner Apple hardware for the Yosemite review and it looked pretty darn fact
[38:50.360 --> 38:54.120]  Well, they're down to the little static link. I think they were I think they rewrap them back up
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.960]  How can you do that? Like that was that was a game, you know again
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.540]  It's a novelty for me to be getting review hardware and part of the game
[39:02.540 --> 39:05.840]  I played was I'm going to rewrap these things so they look like I didn't take them out
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.800]  So I saved all the static link stuff and I put it back on and putting it back on is super hard
[39:09.800 --> 39:11.800]  Like you can't get it lined up, right?
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.880]  Can you wrap a gift?
[39:13.880 --> 39:20.200]  And not great it doesn't look it looks when I wrap a gift it looks like dad wrote wrapped it
[39:20.520 --> 39:27.200]  It does not look like nice and even no matter how much I try I can't I know how to do it now
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.000]  And now I've reached the age where I know what I need to do to make it look good
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.720]  But at a certain point I just don't care anymore
[39:31.720 --> 39:34.480]  Like it all comes down to having the right length overhangs
[39:34.480 --> 39:34.800]  Yeah
[39:34.800 --> 39:39.120]  if you don't have the right length overhangs no amount of skill and folding is gonna save you and then you realize you don't have
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.320]  The right overhangs and you try to like trim it while it's wrapped around the thing to make the over and then that just gets
[39:43.320 --> 39:45.760]  A ragged edge and you just like you know what screw it fold fold fold, right?
[39:45.760 --> 39:46.160]  Good
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.280]  There comes a point where you're you set out to make it like I want to wrap one as good as my wife can wrap
[39:51.280 --> 39:58.560]  A present but eventually I run into that situation and I think wait, this is just gonna be garbage ten seconds after I give it
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.040]  Yeah, you don't try to think don't try to think about it while you're doing it like what am I doing here?
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.680]  Especially when you're wrapping something and it's like a gift for your wife and she already knows what it is
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.000]  It's like what have we even doing here? But like you just got it. It's gonna plow ahead bravely, right?
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  I should just wrap it in the receipt
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.400]  Remember wrapping things in the the funny pages that come yeah, that was the newspaper was a huge thing when we were kids
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.520]  Nobody does that anymore probably because no one gets new specs
[40:24.520 --> 40:28.120]  They would like leave it would leave newsprint all over everything and it was like who does it?
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.560]  I guess it was just like our parents saving money on wrapping paper
[40:30.720 --> 40:33.800]  Yeah, I guess or maybe you know
[40:33.800 --> 40:40.880]  Maybe a little bit of column a saving money and a little bit column B where all of a sudden it's Saturday
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.480]  I forgot I forgot it was the bird. Yeah, it's well
[40:43.480 --> 40:49.960]  It's Saturday morning and the party is at noon and you remember you have the gift you bought the gift at you know
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.080]  Target the other day, but you didn't buy wrapping paper because you thought you still had a closet full of it
[40:54.080 --> 40:56.600]  And you don't and well, we'll just use the Sunday paper
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.240]  Yeah, but that was definitely I would I would say when I was a kid like lower grade school
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.360]  I would say probably about a third of all the gifts that I got were wrapped in the Sunday paper Sunday
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.680]  Well, I I wonder how long we have to go with the schoolbooks being wrapped in
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.400]  Grocery bags. Oh, I remember that for the covers, right?
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.400]  so I think they still do that, but now the big thing and all of the you know, the
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.000]  Fancy stores like Whole Foods and everything is to have cloth reusable cloth bags
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.520]  You don't make all that paper waste. So I wonder how long those things will be around. Yeah, how long can you get a paper bag?
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.900]  Whole Foods gives out paper bags because oh, yeah
[41:35.900 --> 41:39.860]  If you don't if you don't have the little cloth bag because you forgot to put them in the trunk of your car
[41:39.860 --> 41:41.860]  They give you a dirty look and they put your stuff in a paper bag
[41:42.800 --> 41:46.600]  Yeah, there's like a passive-aggressive. Oh, you didn't bring a bag. Oh
[41:48.560 --> 41:51.640]  You don't care about the penguins who are gonna choke to death on the bag
[41:51.640 --> 41:54.480]  I'm gonna put your stuff in well, enjoy your $5 avocados
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.120]  Organic I've heard that if I've heard that if you eat organic produce you cannot get Ebola
[42:02.120 --> 42:09.600]  Yeah, so there finally is an advantage there's a reason to buy the 89 cents a pound organic bananas instead of the
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.360]  69 cents a pound regular bananas because it'll yeah, it'll immunize you against Ebola
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.640]  And they all they come with organic fruit flies that will invade your house if you leave them on your counter too long. They're adorable
[42:20.160 --> 42:22.160]  They're absolutely adorable fruit flies
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.480]  I might as well just take a break and I'll do a second sponsor because it seems like a good a good time to break
[42:29.200 --> 42:34.760]  But then we'll go back. I want to let's talk about next last week's event a little bit too before we get into Yosemite
[42:35.880 --> 42:37.880]  But I want to take a break and thank
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.120]  One well, I love all sponsors but I love I love this one a little more than most our good friends at backblaze
[42:45.120 --> 42:52.640]  unlimited un-throttled backup for your Mac
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.520]  They've been here for so long they've sponsored this show so many times and I always think well everybody's got to be signed up for
[43:01.520 --> 43:02.920]  But people keep signing up
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.120]  So there must be a bunch of you out here who are listening to me right now
[43:06.120 --> 43:11.000]  And you've heard me talk about backblaze before and you've thought that sounds good. I should get that
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.600]  But you haven't done it yet. Well do it. I honestly I don't even mean to run them out as a sponsor
[43:16.600 --> 43:23.080]  But I I love this product and I love this company so much and it's it makes your data safer
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.280]  You install their software on your Mac you sign up for an account
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.680]  You can try it risk-free. No credit card to get your trial period going
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.080]  And then everything on your Mac everything even if you're not a good person
[43:37.080 --> 43:41.240]  You have you know, I don't know the three terabyte external drive and it's all filled up
[43:41.240 --> 43:44.360]  It might take a while for that first backup to get everything up there
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.200]  Depending on your internet connection at home, but just wait it will
[43:49.080 --> 43:56.680]  And once it is then from that point forward everything on that Mac stays in sync backed up to their servers
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.000]  They have over 100 petabytes of total data backed up
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.880]  And the users have just crossed the six billion files restored mark
[44:06.520 --> 44:09.480]  so when you restore let's say a catastrophe hits and
[44:10.600 --> 44:16.280]  You lose your whole startup drive and you don't have a backup near local. You don't have a local backup
[44:17.240 --> 44:19.240]  Well, how you're gonna get your whole, you know
[44:20.360 --> 44:24.360]  One terabyte drive back what you can just tell them they'll put it on a USB drive
[44:24.360 --> 44:30.680]  For you, and then FedEx the drive to you and then ding-dong the UPS guy is there and you've got a hard drive
[44:31.080 --> 44:33.400]  From them with all of your stuff on it
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.200]  Let's say you just need one file what you can log in on the web go to your backup
[44:38.600 --> 44:45.320]  Go, you know through the hierarchy find that file and restore it right there put it in a zip file and you can download it
[44:45.320 --> 44:46.760]  Right there
[44:46.760 --> 44:53.640]  So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good
[44:53.640 --> 44:55.640]  So good, so easy
[44:56.200 --> 44:59.240]  Super reliable cannot recommend them strongly enough
[44:59.920 --> 45:01.920]  So here's what you do. Go to back blaze
[45:02.560 --> 45:09.320]  Com slash daring fireball back blaze comm slash during fireball. Don't know you came from the show and
[45:10.120 --> 45:16.160]  Like I said, it's free to get started free. No risk. No credit card. Just do it. So my thanks to them
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.800]  works great with Yosemite, too
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.360]  So last week's event I
[45:24.720 --> 45:26.440]  Thought it was
[45:26.440 --> 45:29.920]  It was a little weird and I you guys touched on this on ATP
[45:30.600 --> 45:33.560]  With Phil Schiller and was he flat or not?
[45:34.200 --> 45:37.960]  And I got a bunch of emails and tweets from people who are like, hey, what's up with Phil?
[45:37.960 --> 45:43.520]  Was he like, you know something seemed wrong with Phil. You see him distracted is the word I yes
[45:43.520 --> 45:50.280]  That's I I didn't notice this during the event. I thought Phil was just Phil. It's sort of
[45:51.160 --> 45:57.600]  Downbeat Phil not not, you know, just like this is not a big deal Phil and I think it was very deliberate. I
[45:58.440 --> 46:01.040]  Think it was sort of low-key. Maybe I would say I
[46:01.680 --> 46:06.400]  Wouldn't say distracted. Well, but he's always like that to some degree, right? He's
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.740]  The pace of his speaking and his presenting style is always a little bit weird like that
[46:11.740 --> 46:16.700]  Maybe he was up next to people who are doing more fake
[46:17.020 --> 46:22.120]  Enthusiasm about things or being but I just he occasionally does seem distracted about stuff
[46:22.120 --> 46:24.460]  Sometimes I feel like he's distracted because he's thinking about the next thing
[46:24.460 --> 46:27.820]  He's gonna present even though he's been doing this for so long like that. He's
[46:28.420 --> 46:33.900]  thinking about the next thing he's gonna present trying to remember the things he's gonna do in the demo or whatever and he'll get
[46:33.940 --> 46:36.300]  he'll get inside his own head about that and like
[46:36.880 --> 46:40.540]  Forget to fake enthusiasm about something that he's seen a million times before
[46:40.540 --> 46:44.620]  But it did not stick out to me much
[46:44.620 --> 46:49.140]  like I mostly just thought was let's just you know Phil's a low-key kind of guy and this is the way he presents and
[46:49.140 --> 46:51.340]  You've seen it so much that kind of fades into the wallpaper
[46:51.340 --> 46:58.100]  But I always occasionally see him kind of be distracting me for all we maybe he was I forget if the timing of thing
[46:58.100 --> 47:00.100]  Was this before or after?
[47:00.340 --> 47:02.640]  The road trip title thing
[47:03.140 --> 47:08.740]  No, the demo of the guys who like did a typo during the thing and they fixed it in post remember that. Oh, yeah
[47:08.740 --> 47:10.740]  Yeah, yeah
[47:11.100 --> 47:15.460]  Who made the video video editing thing I forget at the time if it was after that
[47:15.460 --> 47:18.700]  It's like he could have been thinking about that, but he's like we rehearsed it so many times
[47:18.700 --> 47:22.700]  How did we screw up this demo? You know, but if it was before that I don't have an explanation
[47:22.820 --> 47:25.980]  Yeah, what was the deal with that? I didn't know that they fixed it in post
[47:25.980 --> 47:28.260]  I remember I didn't notice it during the event and a lot of people
[47:28.700 --> 47:32.660]  Pointed it out was it was it a Federighi demo where he'd mistyped road trip
[47:32.660 --> 47:36.100]  No, it was it was like people who a third-party software developers
[47:36.100 --> 47:39.620]  I don't forget who they are and they were showing their video and they were yeah
[47:39.620 --> 47:44.480]  Yeah, and they were not native English speakers and the guy who was who's are running the demo machine
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.380]  He fell victim to autocorrect that I think it caught a corrected Utah to it instead of Utah road trip
[47:50.380 --> 47:52.980]  It was its road trip and the guy shook his head
[47:53.620 --> 47:58.560]  It was pissed at himself for like falling victim to autocorrect and then just plowed forward with the demo
[47:58.560 --> 48:03.140]  But then in post they they have somewhat a good YouTube clip of an out analyzing this in post
[48:03.140 --> 48:06.060]  they risk re-screen capture the screen image and
[48:06.740 --> 48:08.740]  Froze his image of himself
[48:08.980 --> 48:12.820]  Before he does the head shake and then transition to him at post head shake
[48:12.820 --> 48:13.780]  It was pretty good at it
[48:13.780 --> 48:18.460]  Like was it side by side you see the person you see the screen and they more or less seamlessly made it seem like that
[48:18.460 --> 48:24.620]  Did not happen, but just fine. Okay, that's pretty cool. It is shows you that Apple sweats the detail
[48:24.620 --> 48:29.580]  Oh, yeah, no, like they rehearse it so many times. It's like you could see the autocorrect bubble like we all know autocorrect
[48:29.580 --> 48:32.980]  Oh, don't hit spacebar. It's going to complete the ish
[48:35.340 --> 48:39.760]  My favorite little detail I I'm actually it's like to get the iPad review out
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.900]  I had to shelve it but I still want to write my write a daring fireball piece on my thoughts on last week's event
[48:46.220 --> 48:50.500]  And my favorite little thing and I'm not surprised and you won't be surprised
[48:50.500 --> 48:56.380]  But I had to double-check is that image that they used a couple of times showing a you know
[48:56.380 --> 49:04.140]  a watch a phone an iPad a Mac book and now the iMac like that's you know, I
[49:04.660 --> 49:08.100]  Thought clearly like an homage to like that that evolution image
[49:08.980 --> 49:13.900]  Even though it sort of goes the other way where the Mac was first and these other products, you know came later
[49:13.900 --> 49:16.320]  it's sort of left to right newest to oldest but
[49:16.860 --> 49:18.140]  I
[49:18.140 --> 49:19.760]  Thought that was a really telling image
[49:19.760 --> 49:26.080]  I thought it was especially telling that they used it multiple times early on with Tim Cook and then like in the wrap-up
[49:26.980 --> 49:33.220]  But I checked and of course they made two versions of it. Well, the first one was with an iPad Air
[49:34.420 --> 49:40.000]  Original iPad Air and the one they used at the end when Tim Cook closed the iPad is thinner
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.880]  And it's no yeah, if you look at him side by side
[49:42.880 --> 49:45.980]  It's very noticeable that they made a second version with a thinner iPad
[49:45.980 --> 49:50.040]  Even though they're only showing them from the side and it at any given moment. It was it was
[49:50.540 --> 49:53.420]  Impossible to tell which generation iPad it was because it was from the side
[49:53.980 --> 49:58.340]  Did they make to the iPad the iMac external case proportions change at all?
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.360]  With the retina
[50:01.360 --> 50:05.180]  Yeah, I can't tell it because that's the one I would look for replacement
[50:05.180 --> 50:07.420]  But if they're exactly the same you'll be able to tell like from the side
[50:07.420 --> 50:11.620]  Yeah, like if they had slimmed it down or maybe you can't tell from that angle. But yeah
[50:12.300 --> 50:14.060]  And they were obviously very proud of the thing
[50:14.060 --> 50:19.380]  Although when it first came up I read it is like I know they weren't trying to make it text
[50:19.380 --> 50:23.460]  But but it kind of looked like I guess elo had been on my mind that weird social network thing or whatever
[50:23.460 --> 50:25.120]  It's like this kind of looks like it could be letters
[50:25.120 --> 50:27.940]  They could spell things out with that if they wanted but that's not what it was
[50:27.940 --> 50:33.700]  The evolution thing is much closer analogy because it's from you have a hunch thing to the standing up thing
[50:33.700 --> 50:36.020]  So you got up at the tallest one on the right even if it's you know, yeah
[50:36.460 --> 50:38.740]  Yeah, I'm looking at him now side by side it
[50:38.740 --> 50:46.680]  They changed the lighting on the iMac in the between the two slides and it makes the the app that the after one
[50:46.680 --> 50:47.780]  It looks a little thinner
[50:47.780 --> 50:52.420]  but I it looks to me though that it's just that they that they change the lighting and there's
[50:53.020 --> 50:55.220]  Less of it and more of it's in shadow
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.420]  It's just a different product like that
[50:57.420 --> 50:59.040]  It's a different product shot like, you know
[50:59.040 --> 51:01.180]  When they when they brought up the new iMac to take a shot of it
[51:01.180 --> 51:03.740]  The lighting wasn't the same as when they have that older iMac take a shot of it
[51:03.740 --> 51:07.740]  So it shows up differently like I I think you link to a few people talking about this and I mostly agree with
[51:07.740 --> 51:10.420]  whatever person you link to that was taught saying like
[51:11.020 --> 51:16.260]  this is cute and all but it doesn't communicate to people who aren't already on board much of anything because
[51:17.100 --> 51:23.740]  Regular people might not even understand what they're looking at let alone which devices which like Apple was clearly
[51:24.100 --> 51:28.420]  excited and proud of it and we Apple followers and nerds thought it was clever and interesting and
[51:28.540 --> 51:33.240]  Novel because you have to find some interesting way to show these things instead of just like here's all the screens with black borders
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.540]  That Apple makes they come in different sizes, right? And you know, one of them has a little stand to the end
[51:37.540 --> 51:41.580]  so coming up with new and interesting ways to photograph Apple's product line is a
[51:42.260 --> 51:44.260]  challenge that is mostly
[51:44.900 --> 51:48.340]  Relevant to people who either work at Apple or have been following Apple for a long time
[51:48.340 --> 51:51.260]  Whereas if you throw that image up in front of regular people
[51:51.260 --> 51:54.300]  I'm not sure how well it will communicate anything or read to them at all
[51:54.300 --> 51:58.380]  But I you know the audience for this Apple event anyone. This is not the iPhone event
[51:58.380 --> 52:02.260]  This is the the lesser event in was in a town hall or whatever
[52:03.540 --> 52:05.260]  small room
[52:05.260 --> 52:10.180]  Mostly of interest to Apple follower. So it was the appropriate venue for that image, but I'm not sure how well it reads
[52:10.180 --> 52:12.180]  Yeah, I don't think it
[52:12.260 --> 52:16.740]  That's why I found it interesting because there's two parts to the to the Apple
[52:17.740 --> 52:21.220]  Presentations not necessarily two halves, but there's two types of messages
[52:21.220 --> 52:28.420]  They seek to convey some are for the mass market and they sometimes even showed that actual commercials that they're going to put on real TV
[52:28.460 --> 52:30.460]  They'll just show the commercial
[52:30.460 --> 52:35.160]  Right there. So it's exactly what they're going to be pushing in their marketing to
[52:36.340 --> 52:43.980]  hundreds of millions of real people through advertising but then other parts are the as close as Apple will get to inside baseball and
[52:44.700 --> 52:49.260]  that's meant for like us in the media who are
[52:49.860 --> 52:51.860]  then going to
[52:52.100 --> 52:54.820]  You know, it's it's it's like they're playing a bank shot
[52:54.820 --> 53:02.060]  They're trying to get us to understand them so that when we write about them to the mass market that we're going to
[53:02.420 --> 53:05.620]  Have it right that we we see what Apple is seeing
[53:06.100 --> 53:09.860]  yeah, they're gonna emphasize the parts that they think will tickle our
[53:10.380 --> 53:14.480]  the fancy of the the Apple fans like they're gonna show you the video about the
[53:14.620 --> 53:20.860]  manufacturing process and emphasize the beauty of one particular physical feature so that in the hopes that when you write you review that feature that
[53:20.860 --> 53:22.240]  You might have overlooked you'll say well
[53:22.240 --> 53:27.420]  I just they showed this whole five-minute video of a factory and and Johnny I've in his white world talking about it and
[53:27.780 --> 53:32.660]  Suddenly that's more prominent in your mind. It's just basically basic, you know talking to the press type of things
[53:32.660 --> 53:37.540]  But they will they're never gonna show that video of the Mac Pro factory to regular people
[53:37.540 --> 53:42.020]  We don't care about the macro at all period and and certainly not how or where it's built
[53:42.020 --> 53:43.980]  They're all the things they did about the unibody or whatever
[53:43.980 --> 53:46.980]  Like they can say it's unibody and they can give the thing out or whatever
[53:46.980 --> 53:48.340]  But they're gonna show those, you know
[53:48.340 --> 53:53.980]  computer controlled milling machines with the water going over them and just talk about it forever like when they came out with the MacBook Air and
[53:53.980 --> 53:55.140]  Then so the subsequent unit bodies
[53:55.140 --> 54:00.380]  They really hammered on that to try to get the message across to the press who would then get the message across that
[54:00.380 --> 54:04.980]  Hey, I know you understand what unibody is and I know you're gonna see it's one piece and blah blah
[54:04.980 --> 54:08.900]  But it actually makes a difference and it's a big deal and that's that's the bank shot
[54:08.900 --> 54:11.820]  you know five minute video on CNC milling machines and
[54:11.820 --> 54:19.140]  that hopefully translates to a little bit extra emphasis when the first unibody product got in the consumer facing product reviews
[54:21.020 --> 54:25.180]  Another I just I love this image and I think another answer somebody compared it somebody on Twitter
[54:25.340 --> 54:29.660]  Compared it to one from one of the recent events that Microsoft had
[54:31.180 --> 54:37.760]  For like the surface probably the surface pro 3 event and they had a table lined up in their hands-on area with
[54:37.760 --> 54:41.300]  Nokia phones and surface pros and
[54:42.540 --> 54:48.160]  Some of them on the table and some of them in a laptop stand and desktop computers and laptop computers
[54:48.480 --> 54:52.660]  You know up to the you know, whatever the HP equivalent of an iMac is
[54:53.160 --> 54:55.480]  All of them running exactly the same
[54:56.120 --> 55:02.400]  Start screen, you know this blue, you know blue colored whatever the whatever they renamed Metro
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.280]  Interface, you know and that what a country, you know
[55:05.280 --> 55:11.120]  It's a philosophical contrast where you know, Microsoft went in this direction where you get the exact same interface across
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.120]  phone from phone to you know, 30-inch desktop display and
[55:17.460 --> 55:21.520]  Apple, you know when it and as you know reiterated this year
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.960]  you know that each each of these devices gets an interface that is just for that form factor and
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.600]  Include, you know making them very different
[55:29.600 --> 55:36.320]  and you know, we can even talk about when we still move get into your Yosemite review the way that Yosemite is
[55:36.880 --> 55:40.320]  clearly inspired by the direction that iOS 7 went but it's
[55:41.120 --> 55:42.080]  even at a
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.280]  Glance just if you've been tuned out for six months and still haven't even seen Yosemite and you took a look at it right now
[55:48.280 --> 55:54.140]  You wouldn't think oh they copied iOS 7 that it's you know, the exact same thing. It's different
[55:54.140 --> 55:59.980]  Yeah, it's a family resemblance, but it's like a brother or a cousin. It is not an identical twin exactly. Yeah
[55:59.980 --> 56:02.440]  Yeah, like a sibling not a twin
[56:04.060 --> 56:07.900]  And I think showing these devices in this promotional image for us, you know
[56:07.900 --> 56:12.260]  This press image where you don't even see the display is in a in a strange way
[56:12.580 --> 56:16.580]  Emphasizes that that what you would see on the displays are very different across them
[56:18.460 --> 56:23.020]  And also think and I think this is always interesting to me and I try to think about it is
[56:23.020 --> 56:30.180]  What are the things that Apple is trying to convey to us that they can't bring themselves to say?
[56:30.460 --> 56:33.100]  For various reasons because it's you know
[56:33.180 --> 56:38.820]  They just couldn't say that and to me this one of the things with this image in a way that they spoke about it is
[56:41.820 --> 56:43.660]  That they don't expect
[56:43.660 --> 56:46.220]  Or even want everybody to buy everything
[56:46.380 --> 56:51.100]  you're not supposed to have an iMac and a MacBook and an iPad and an iPad mini and
[56:51.100 --> 56:53.680]  You know a phone and a watch
[56:54.520 --> 57:00.280]  If you do great, you know, you're a great customer. But if you just have two of them, that's great
[57:00.280 --> 57:02.800]  You know, maybe you have this, you know
[57:02.800 --> 57:08.560]  like the I iPhone 6 plus and because it's a huge phone you feel like now I don't need an iPad and
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.560]  Your only other product is a MacBook and you just use that MacBook everywhere use it at your desk
[57:14.560 --> 57:21.760]  You use it when you travel and that's it. You're a that's a perfect. You're a perfectly encouraged
[57:22.080 --> 57:27.360]  That's it. That's that's absolutely encouraged, but they can't say that they can't say it's okay if you don't buy this
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.480]  You know what? I mean? It's you you can't get on stage and say, you know, there's cool new iMac that we just showed you
[57:32.560 --> 57:35.120]  It's totally fine. If you don't buy it and just use a MacBook
[57:35.640 --> 57:40.560]  Yeah, we talked about this on an ATP a little while ago about how they even just within the iOS device range
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.880]  But anyway, you need all of them if you see them head-on or whatever again
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.980]  They all just look like a black border around a color LCD screen of various sizes
[57:48.400 --> 57:54.560]  but now they really fleshed out the range especially with the watch being a little tiny thing and then you have all the different various
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.960]  Sizes of iPhones and the big one and then the biggest one gets close to the mini and then you have that
[57:58.960 --> 57:59.240]  You know
[57:59.240 --> 58:06.240]  Like it's a pretty smooth scale up of rectangular color screens that you can buy from Apple all up to the big giant retina one
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.440]  that you bought
[58:07.440 --> 58:14.120]  But and as the physical form factors have started to form the smooth scale that they're kind of showing in this image here
[58:15.040 --> 58:23.200]  There's still discontinuities because what is the difference between an iPhone 6 plus and an iPad one runs iPad apps and one runs?
[58:23.800 --> 58:27.100]  Phone apps and the line between them, you know
[58:27.100 --> 58:31.840]  we're saying an ATP is probably going to go away sometime in the near future because that distinction like
[58:31.840 --> 58:37.880]  If you were to get an iPhone 6 plus you go to the App Store and be like, oh, I totally want this game
[58:37.880 --> 58:40.880]  Or this app and they're like, oh, sorry, you can't it's iPad only
[58:40.880 --> 58:44.280]  It's like what do you mean iPad only like the iPad isn't that much bigger than the screen? I'm holding my hand
[58:44.280 --> 58:45.800]  What is it about the thing? I'm holding in my hand
[58:45.800 --> 58:50.240]  That means it can't run a quote unquote iPad app that distinction seems like it's gonna go away
[58:50.240 --> 58:52.320]  But this the other gap of like you get the you know
[58:52.320 --> 58:57.440]  The iPad air or if they were coming with like an iPad Pro and then to a MacBook Air which presumably go right in it
[58:57.440 --> 59:01.240]  Too why are these so different like well is easier to explain one as a keyboard?
[59:01.240 --> 59:04.000]  But they run totally different OS is one is touch one is not touch
[59:04.960 --> 59:06.200]  like
[59:06.200 --> 59:11.200]  They Apple is expecting you to pick your spot in their product line where you feel comfortable because there are
[59:11.640 --> 59:17.240]  discontinuities still and I they're never gonna paper over them to the degree that Microsoft does like oh one OS everywhere is that's not what
[59:17.240 --> 59:19.240]  Apple believes in but in any kind of
[59:19.540 --> 59:23.920]  Transition like there's another discontinuity when you go from the phone to the watch because it just has to be it can't work the same
[59:23.920 --> 59:25.240]  Way, it's just too small or whatever
[59:25.240 --> 59:28.840]  So these little gaps like if they were to space it out or be like watch
[59:28.840 --> 59:34.440]  Big gap phone phone phone tiny gap iPad bigger gap laptop even bigger gap
[59:34.440 --> 59:39.280]  I'm at you know, and you're supposed to pick in that range of like, you know
[59:39.280 --> 59:42.280]  like a Chinese food menu one from column a one from column B like and
[59:42.960 --> 59:48.080]  Make up the suite of devices that fill out your life and I by having this range
[59:48.080 --> 59:53.080]  I think obviously someone's not just gonna buy the watch and not have a PC and not have a cell phone like there you're gonna have
[59:53.080 --> 59:59.080]  Something in this range just which ones do you think you need? No one needs to fill in all the gaps? Yeah
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.280]  And then they but they can't say it that in that way, right?
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.320]  And I well they say it in the way like we have something for every yeah
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.920]  You know like they just say look at this range like look at the richest of this range
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.060]  They're surely there is something that fits your needs like we you know
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.900]  They're fleshing it out like diversifying the iPhone line for the longest time
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:20.400]  Like the iPhone was the iPhone and everybody wanted like even now you said is room for diversification of like, you know
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.540]  Make one thicker and have longer battery life or something
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.940]  But like they've diversified their line to say
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.980]  Something for everybody and the same way they don't expect you to buy two iPhones like the big one in the small one or your night
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.280]  Phone or your day phone?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.640]  it's the same thing that they don't say that because they think it's obvious but
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.480]  Just like they're not gonna say if you if you buy, you know MacBook Pro
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.560]  We probably don't expect you to buy an iMac because the macro Pro is a completely fully capable
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:50.000]  Awesome machine that you can do everything on but if you're the kind of person who wants a desktop we will offer one of those
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.220]  two
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.220]  Yeah
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.480]  Mac Pro
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:08.240]  Some people wrote to me after the iMac announcement and they're sort of I have obviously they've bought a Mac Pro in the last
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.360]  ten months
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:16.520]  And they're angry that the marker right now Marco, you know did not get angry. He just went out and bought an iMac
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:22.280]  But to me that's so totally not surprising
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.920]  you know that that even though the Mac Pro is a very expensive machine and it in
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:35.560]  Theory should always be at the leading edge of technology and it is in a lot of ways that it didn't go retina first
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.800]  Or at least simultaneously and probably not even close
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:45.360]  like I know Marco's logic of why he doesn't think a standalone 5k display is gonna ship from Apple until
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.640]  2016 is pretty sound because it there's a lot of I think he's I think it probably does need
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.240]  DisplayPort slash Thunderbolt, you know 1.3 slash Thunderbolt 3
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.680]  Because they're not gonna do that. They're not gonna have you run two cables to drive it
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.640]  Just yeah
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.480]  I mean that there was always obvious that
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.160]  There's an advantage of an all-in-one the advantage the all-in-one has is they can use whatever the hell interconnect they want inside that
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.720]  Box, right? It doesn't need to conform to any specification
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.480]  It doesn't need they could just do what do what you got to do to make it work. It all happens inside the box
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.440]  and so you're always going to have an advantage for that thing if it happened that a
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.760]  Standardized external interconnect existed for retina displays in the same time frame as the Mac Pro the Mac Pro would have had it first
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.540]  Yeah, but it just so happened that it didn't what in and then you're like, okay
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.540]  well, we need to get written out there somehow and
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.120]  because the Mac Pro uses the you know
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.260]  The Xeon parts and because they're a generation behind and because we don't have the external internecks
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.100]  Apple just did whatever the hell it took to get it done inside this iMac box and don't worry about what goes on behind
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.540]  the curtain, right
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:51.780]  But it does create this weird and in the historical time, you know, five six seven years from now
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:57.620]  We're gonna look back on it and it'll just be compressed and we'll just remember that the iMac was first and everything
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.180]  You know the standalone displays were second in the interim though
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.580]  It is weird that the iMac is gonna have these super amazing retina
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.980]  Displays and the Mac Pro no matter how much money you spend on it won't unless you know
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:14.900]  Well, I mean you can get a 4k display not from app right for your back and then you'd buy one of those like special
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:20.780]  You know ones for photography that has a bigger color gamut and has better accuracy and you know buy it from any see
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.020]  It's like the people who are buying Mac pros might already have
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:31.620]  These super high-risk monitors for 4k video editing that conform to different standards than this consumer iMac screen
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.760]  Yeah, so it's not I the people who might be complaining or people who would bought a Mac Pro
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.000]  But didn't really need one and just wanted to have a king of the home machine now that right, right
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.700]  That's because I do think that's what irks them. Is that now?
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.680]  until there's a 5k
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.720]  Standalone display and when that comes out it won't run on the exit. You're gonna have to get a new Pro anyway
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.640]  All right, then they should have known that going in
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:55.880]  I mean
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.800]  one of the many reasons that I didn't buy one is like well if I was waiting for retina this Mac Pro is not the
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.580]  Machine because we know what it's capable of we know Apple didn't even offer any monitors
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.560]  I didn't want a third-party monitor. And if I did have a third-party and I didn't want it to be 4k
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.740]  I wanted what Apple made here. I wanted 27 inch the resolution of my wife's 27 inch Thunderbolt display
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.520]  It just doubled the the number of pixels vertically and horizontal. Yeah, there's that's the thing that really blew me away at first
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.960]  I was like
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.080]  Waiting for the well
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:29.760]  There's got to be a catch and then I thought about like like with the iPhone 6 plus where it's not really 3x retina
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.560]  It's 2 2.8 retina or 2.6 and they just use scaling to make it work and it looks pretty good
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.280]  But it's still not the same time
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.040]  I thought maybe it's like a scaling thing and then you know
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.620]  They gave the pixel dimensions and I'm like dividing in my head and I'm like, ooh, that sounds like actual 2x retina
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:51.960]  You know and it is yeah, Dell had announced a monitor with similar specs
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.900]  So you soon as Dell announced you're like, okay
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.060]  Well, this this is must be technically possible now if Dell is gonna offer one
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.960]  So once it's technically possible, then it's just like when when does Apple have a product that this could wear?
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.000]  I mean if the iMac didn't exist and Dell comes out with this monitor
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  the current Mac pros can't drive with a single cable and
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.020]  Might not be able to drive with two depending on how they did it
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.980]  Then we just would all been waiting and we'd be like well Dell's got these monitors, but we can't have them
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.540]  But you know, the iMac does exist and it gave Apple an opportunity
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.860]  To you know, we can get as soon as those displays are available
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.680]  We got to get one into one of our machines and the iMac is the way to make that happen
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.120]  Yeah, so fame is you know knock on wood
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.280]  Let's wait until I actually take it out and set it up and use it but on paper at least and from what I've seen
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.360]  In person, this is the Mac. I've been waiting for
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.040]  Close to ten years
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:45.200]  You know, yeah, it's gonna be a big upgrade huge upgrade ever since I remember when they were first started talking about it
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.360]  WWDC and maybe 2006 2007 but what they called it
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.040]  What did they call it they did it before they had the word retina hi DPI
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.400]  resolution resolution independence scalable UI
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:03.680]  Resolution independence was was the thing and I remember because I mentioned this to like my fellow
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:10.480]  obsessive on resolution independence is cable Sasser at panic and I remember going to the session at
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.920]  WWDC with him and we came out so excited and he was like
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.160]  We're gonna do we're gonna redo all the graphics and all of our apps as PDFs and they did in fact
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.500]  They like panic started shipping apps with with scalable PDF
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.840]  Icons and stuff like that inside for toolbars and stuff like that years ago
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.520]  Because cable and I both convinced ourselves. I don't even know what we were thinking
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.800]  I mean it well, it's not it's not just you like app
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.960]  Like if you go back through my old OS 10 reviews Apple made promises
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.480]  They're like by 2008 our whole product line will be resolution independent. So get ready
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.440]  I was like 2006 when they say there I think they gave it they gave a year and a date and like every year like
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.680]  There used to be a section in my OS 10 reviews is like
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.720]  You know resolution independence
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.840]  How's that going along and I would take a little screenshot of text edit in like 2x mode or 1.5 x mode and you see
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.360]  What a train wreck it is, you know, like and that's why this is still not a user-facing picture. See you next year
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:08.080]  I we just convinced ourselves that the like retina IMAX we're gonna be coming out in like 2008 and
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.700]  We were so excited. We wanted to get in line to buy one then
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.640]  And it took until now
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.920]  Just I mean it was so much easier to make the iPhone 4 screen. It's way smaller
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.440]  It's right fewer pixels and it's just so hard to make it that density, you know
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.280]  So we had to wait a long time before it was economically feasible to make a screen this mass
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.560]  I mean that was the whole thing with the retina
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.120]  It's like well
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.040]  Maybe they could do this earlier if like maybe they'll just do it for the 21 inch on a Mac
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.220]  Right because they could have gone that they could have probably made that one retina sooner
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:40.480]  It would have been like 4k ish or 3k ish type resolution, but no they went for the whole enchilada
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.840]  Yeah, and it's really as far as I can tell no compromise
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.480]  It's you know in terms of the number of pixels the way they're doing it
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.840]  You know that there's no no cheapening out on it. It's super bright
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.720]  It's amazing to me because that was the other thing too during the the event last week
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.920]  after you know Phil gave the specs and the size and
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.080]  You know, I I thought well, you know what it's gonna be power
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.840]  It's kind of this thing it's because that's you know, it's a huge problem all these pixels lighting it up
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.080]  Is this thing gonna get super hot and instead it takes less power, which is crazy
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.000]  Yeah
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.160]  that that's the thing that made me feel good about the machine that like
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.380]  That it's not gonna be just at the ragged edge of what's possible to wedge into this thing
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:29.120]  Right, you know with the cooling and everything so they you know, the GPU is hotter
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.860]  But they made up for it by actually making a screen consume less
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:32.080]  Yeah
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:39.420]  my hope is that it's what by not compromising and clearly like you said they could have shipped something sooner whether it was like the
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.420]  go 21 inch first or
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:47.220]  make it a 27 inch 4k display and you scaling to make the on-screen elements a
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.620]  Reasonable size as opposed to making everything cartoonishly large
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.140]  They could have done any number of those things
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:09:01.360]  Within the last few years and didn't and I think hopefully it's almost like they're shipping like a 2.0 version of it
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.720]  That they waited until they could get everything just right
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:11.040]  This is what people who have one sitting in their house tell themselves to make themselves feel better about first-generation Apple products
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  This is practically a 2.0
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.640]  Made so far so so far so good
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.880]  the only there was a little bit scary moment this morning when Marco and I had a few people tweeting at us to like
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:32.000]  Look at this stuttery like someone was swiping through spaces on their new retina 5k iMac and it was like super slow and stuttery
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.320]  It was like go
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.500]  But then a million other people tweeted and showed the exact same thing on there, you know, 13-inch MacBook Pros
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  It's just some weird Yosemite bug and then hopefully they'll work out in 10 10 1
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.160]  Which will hopefully come out soon because I had no reproductions at home
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.020]  Like I mean even on my you know, pre unibody MacBook Pro
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.040]  Smooth doing all that stuff, but then on my Mac at work that had been on for days. That's running Yosemite. I
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.680]  enabled
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.160]  Activated mission control which I never do otherwise and it was stuttery
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.560]  so I'm like, oh this has got to be Yosemite bug because we get reports like it doesn't happen all the time and
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.480]  The best I can tell is that it's some kind of issue that happens when your Mac is on for a really long time
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:16.400]  But anyway, there are bugs and that was the only scare so far about the 5k iMacs turns out to be a false alarm
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:16.880]  Yeah
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:24.720]  I never know how far I can push it in the hands-on areas after these events like and there's others who are
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.880]  A bolder than I am who will do it download geek bench in trouble. Yes. Yeah, I wouldn't do that
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.960]  Yeah, because then they'd stop you there's everyone
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.860]  It was what's the point like if people gonna get loaner hardware anyway
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.900]  Then you can test it for all you want like it's not that thing to do in the hands-on area
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:48.060]  Well, and I could see how the people though who aren't getting review units would be more tempted to do something like that and see
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.000]  If they can get away with getting yeah
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.840]  All right, like the iOS devices like you want to find out if it's three cores in that iPad, right? So, right
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.480]  You know quickly go to some yeah, I don't know
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.840]  Exploit some crazy jailbreak thing to quickly get some little executable to run. Yeah, they they'll I think they'll generally cut you off before you get
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.840]  that part
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.220]  But it's funny talking to them because the the people who staff the hands-on areas
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:18.540]  I think are all I know most of them are but I think all of them work under Schiller in the product marketing
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.540]  division at Apple and
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.260]  They're it's easy to think of them
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:27.760]  You know, they all wear t-shirts like like they're working in an Apple store or something like that
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:34.340]  but they're all like in my experience super super informed about the stuff that you are that
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.380]  You're talking about like if I'd ask them. Hey, is this three core and
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.600]  Is that how it went from to two billion transistors to three?
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:48.380]  They would know the answer but they'd also know that they're not allowed to tell me like they're super super important
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:52.580]  No, they're totally brief. They'd have they have their talking points. They know what they will talk to you about they know
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:58.020]  Specific phrasing for you know, if you ask them a question about something and they're gonna tell you something about they're gonna
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.100]  They're all gonna use the same sentence in the same words. It's it's talking. Well, yeah that they are professional
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.060]  Yeah, and that's all it's very evident
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.600]  Like if you know anybody was there at their first, you know
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.620]  The first time you get invited to an Apple event you go to the hands-on area
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.380]  It's very clear that they have a script and they have talking points
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.720]  but the other thing though, is that they
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.720]  their full-time jobs
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760]  363 other days a year are
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:28.680]  Working in Apple's product marketing being hyper informed about all of the technical details of all of Apple's products
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.480]  like these people
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.440]  Know they know their shit. They know the stuff that's not on the script and
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:40.180]  It's you know, and they're not going to be fooled by somebody trying to download Geekbench or something like that
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:47.300]  maybe I could see getting away with it and in the early parts of the hands-on areas because it's so crazy and crowded and
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.140]  It's everybody wants to get the hands on him at once and maybe you can get away with it
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.140]  But not for long. My thing was I
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.420]  They were showing
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.960]  Photos of course
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.940]  Big images
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.820]  Because it you know, it just shows off the thing they commissioned a guy with like one of those
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.300]  I think they're called hasselbads hasselbads but you know like this camera that shoots like I
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:21.420]  don't know 50 50 megapixel digital images and like a cityscape and you can see these details and you can just zoom in and
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.800]  Read like the license plate number on the car and then zoom back out and it's you know
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.100]  You can actually see that it's still being rendered in individual pixels on screen
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:35.700]  but I closed that and went to like the finder and opened up like a safari window and then tried to drag it around the
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.020]  Window as fast as I could like that was my benchmark in the hands-on area
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.420]  Like if I drag a window around as fast as I can does it does it shear?
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.540]  Yeah, like I think yeah, that was a good thing to test and also, you know
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.140]  if you think about the the first
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.600]  15 inch right now MacBook Pros like scrolling at the maximum resolution at the one that was bigger than the native screen
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.500]  You know that that one had a little bit of issues find out
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.160]  you know probably but the scaling and not with the compositing because compositing has always been fast compositing is
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.320]  Pretty easy to do the way you're looking for shearing is because you know
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.440]  they have to be driving it was like essentially to
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.800]  DisplayPort 1.2 connections or the equivalent behind the scenes and like you would look at like the driving the left half of the screen
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.960]  right at the screen differently
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.660]  But like I mean that's the type of thing Apple would not ship if you could if you could get
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:24.800]  Tearing while dragging windows around I mean Apple never shipped that even when it meant that dragging windows around was slow as molasses
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.240]  You still didn't get any tearing. That's like I would have been I would have been shocked
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:34.160]  But it's like something I had to see to believe. Yeah, I had but that was the extent that I tested it in advance
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.200]  Yeah, and scrolling I put I positioned a window right in the middle
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.600]  So if there was a you know
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.640]  If it was some kind of two screens glued together trickery that I tried to figure that out. And of course, it's not
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:55.520]  Anything else from the event last week, I guess there's the iPad to iPad air 2 which is kind of interesting. I
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.520]  Think the way that they've gone with the air with the iPads is
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.600]  I try to write about it this week that it's there's no real annual pattern to it. And I don't think it means that it's
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.240]  directionless, I just feel like
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.800]  The the engineering winds that they can pull off each year
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:22.320]  While maintaining their profit margins are very very different as compared to the iPhone which to me seems much more predictable
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:29.280]  The thing with the top-end iPad and the reason I'm still totally in favor on iPad Pro is like
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.080]  While no one is really paying much attention. They are pushing up the
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.360]  the highest end iOS device
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.520]  Pushing up really close to PC class in terms of power
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.280]  Yeah, not in terms of interface like it still doesn't have a keyboard still it's still touch or whatever
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.400]  But you know and it doesn't seem like a big deal like oh, so what I run my iOS apps faster
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.120]  and maybe like a game will look nicer or something like that, but it's like it's one of those things where
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  When we have all the steps in between
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.000]  It doesn't seem so impressive like it's not as impressive as you know
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.120]  iPhone 3gs to iPhone 4 where they go right and you're like wow, they just doubled everything. It's amazing, right?
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.760]  But through a series of small steps, there's gonna come a point where new classes of applications are possible on an iPad
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.400]  Merely because they've been pressing it forward and there was a little stall there
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.040]  I think a lot of it has to do with like just having one gigabyte of RAM for a long time
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.160]  But now and and having two cores for how long have we had two cores like everyone else has gone quad-core and like the android space
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.400]  And everything like that. So now they're pressing again two gigs of RAM three cores
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.360]  I don't think it makes new categories of stuff available to you
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.400]  But maybe a generation or two from now we're going to wake up and say there are things that the iPad can do
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.600]  That the iPhone can't quite dream of doing yet. I mean right now
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.000]  It's like you just need this extra power to run this bigger screen and the iPhone, you know is reasonable
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.400]  But like I I think you had just have so much more headroom in the bigger form factor so far
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.800]  They haven't really been willing to do with that much. This is the first year
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.160]  I feel like they're pulling away by giving it double the RAM and everything
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.760]  But you know, there is room. I think there is room for for more sophisticated applications
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.280]  To be on a an even larger and even more powerful iPad. We're just like right now
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.120]  It's kind of like we're inching towards then. It just seems like man a faster bigger iPad
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.400]  Well, I think the two demos they chose art were really good
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.720]  I think they were such great demos the pixel pixel mentor and replay
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600]  Did you see the shiller mispronounced it?
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.120]  It's been listening to you too much. Yeah, so Schiller called it pixel mater
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.440]  But those are good demos because in theory if they've already got the iOS app
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.080]  Working for the iPad they could come out with maybe they will even they you know
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.360]  Maybe when when pixel mater for iOS ships, it will be universal and it'll run on your iPhone, too
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.520]  But clearly editing photos is better. The better the better it is
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:57.120]  And on a phone screen, you're seriously constrained, you know, and for like the exact thing that they did where they're making like an advertisement for
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.360]  you know this big image and they want to superimpose text and
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.200]  You know having a laptop size screen like the full size iPad
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.960]  Even though that might be small for a laptop. It's still certainly, you know, nobody, you know
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.520]  The the small iPad is not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.880]  Nobody, you know the the small iPad the mini is vaguely
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.680]  Giant size phone size, right? It would be the biggest phone ever but it's you know, you could imagine somebody making an Android phone
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.560]  That's the size of an iPad mini but not an iPad
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.980]  And for photo editing it's you know size matters and then I think with those replay guys. I thought that was an interesting
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.480]  Boy, you could never do that on a PC
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.480]  Demo
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:53.120]  Because to me the big part of that is that you've already got you it's the device you use to ship shoot the clips
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.640]  It's all one thing. It's the camera. It's the editing system. It's the it's the playback system
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.480]  right, and you don't have that with a laptop like where you might shoot a bunch of video on your phone and
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.880]  Then you can connect your phone
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.500]  with the lightning adapter to your MacBook and suck all the video over and open and then you might airplay it onto your TV so
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:18.000]  People can see it or put it back on your phone because it must people gathered around your screen. Yeah, but it's certainly
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:23.560]  Hey, that's beyond the technical acumen of a lot of typical people and B
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560]  It's not something you want to do when you're on vacation
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.360]  Like in the demo that yeah, because it gives you that
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.880]  Yeah, it's like it's the type of thing where when you're on vacation you tell yourself when you get back home boy
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.080]  You're gonna spend a day and take all of your stuff and put it onto your computer and make a nice video and send it
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.320]  out to people but you won't because you get back from vacation and you're rushing around and you're back to your regular right and there's
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.760]  Whereas when you're on vacation, you got the iPad with you
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.980]  You can do it when you you know
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.240]  Go back to your hotel room or whatever
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.240]  or while you're waiting for your table at dinner and just suck these clips in and
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:56.840]  Push a button and have a finished video pop out that you could post share share right there and then say hey
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.960]  Hey guys, this is what we're doing. I'm very our vacation and like the other thing
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.120]  It's lurking for the iPad which we still haven't seen but people have poked around like the whole, you know
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:09.680]  Split-screen multitasking which we know is lurking the code for splitting multiple apps into thirds and quarters
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.280]  It's there and obviously it's not baked yet and they're not ready for it
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.320]  and maybe you need a bigger iPad or whatever, but that's what I'm talking about of like
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.480]  Pressing the limits of what can be done on a touch device
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.480]  I can't help but think that going to two gigs of RAM is a sign that
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.880]  If there's an iPad Pro in like five months from now
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:34.320]  You know that because that's the route the rumor is, you know, make maybe like February or March. They're gonna have an iPad Pro
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.960]  You know 12 or 13 inches or something like that and it'll have split-screen
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.940]  My guess is that this iPad if that's true this iPad air 2 will get the split-screen too
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.560]  But no other iPad will because yeah, because it's just not enough room on the smaller. Yeah
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.400]  I think it's not like they've promised it but you know
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.240]  and in fact, I guess they still sell the the I think the original mini which they're selling for 249 is only
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.760]  512 megs of RAM
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.680]  And you know you guys talked about an ATP
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:11.600]  But it's it the frustration with the growing range from bottom high-end to low-end is that developers don't have the ability to say
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.600]  This app only runs on the iPad air 2 because it's so graphically intense
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.920]  You can't do that your your iPad your iPad app has to run on at least launch on all iPads
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:26.760]  Yeah, but that's something Apple has the flexibility to change at any time though. It's an app just an App Store rule
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.120]  They can change the rule at any time
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.860]  They can give you a little API and a point update to definitively say, you know
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:37.520]  Because they keep bragging about as Marco pointed out that big that big chart that shows the GPU
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.400]  Speed that goes up like a big hockey stick. Look how far we've come the 8x
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:47.200]  It's GPU is so incredibly powerful and yet they're still shipping the second dot on the graph the second lowest one
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.880]  It's like well, it doesn't help me because if I got to make a game that runs in that second dot
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.480]  I don't it's actually
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.400]  Frustrating to me the 8x is out there because now I got to make a game that like
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:02.680]  Scales from all the way out at the I can't believe we used to live like animals like that end of the hockey stick curve
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.540]  Yeah, like well, we'll just remove texture mapping in that version. It'll just be flat shading
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.500]  But I do think that there's a general, you know
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.160]  The gist of it is if you're an iPad app or you know a modern iPhone app
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.680]  You can more or less assume that you're you have access to about a gig of memory if you need if you need it
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:22.640]  so I feel like this I feel like the iPad air to getting to is
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:28.560]  Is a sign that if there's split-screen that it'll it'll get it and I don't think the other ones will
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.000]  Yeah, and it's just time for two gigs
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.480]  Like it's kind of sad that the iPhone doesn't have a bit of the very least you can make some kind of battery life
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.760]  Excuse for the phone. Yeah, definitely
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.480]  I
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.140]  Mean, maybe like it's like it's borderline they made it a half a millimeter thicker and they gave it two gigs of RAM
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:51.040]  It would be a different device, but you'd have more. Yeah, and there's a there's a Quora post
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.880]  I haven't linked to it from Daring Fireball because I feel like it's a little I
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:01.180]  I don't I can't verify it myself and it seems a little bit too rah rah Apple
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:05.120]  Even when they even when they don't even when they don't put enough RAM in the phone
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.400]  It's it's all good. But the expert if somebody asked on Quora
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.100]  Why why did the new iPhone 6 only still only have one gigabyte of RAM?
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.140]  when a lot of the top top-shelf competitors on Android have to
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.220]  and like the top-ranked answer was somebody saying that it's
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.600]  there's probably a whole bunch of other reasons too, but a big one is that a
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.660]  garbage collected system like Java
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:36.820]  Needs double the RAM of a non garbage collected system like iOS and that they've linked to like an academic paper that showed
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.320]  how
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.260]  You know if you can give a garbage collected system enough RAM
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:48.420]  it all just works out but when a garbage collected system gets RAM constrained it goes to hell and
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.340]  Everything gets gummed up waiting for memory
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:01.020]  And I think there's something to that I do think that you know that iOS because it's not garbage collected can get by on one gig
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.760]  longer than it will then like Android could have but I
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:10.640]  Still, you know, it's it's still irritating every time I go back to Safari and my tabs have all been flushed
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:18.340]  Yeah, and that's that kind of that's the real luxury of buying the top-end iPad air too is gonna get you
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:23.080]  It's like oh, thank god and go back to Safari a Safari is still running itself and be the tabs that are in Safari
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:29.040]  I I just had I noticed with my review unit my first right before about an hour before the show
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.560]  I was flipping through your your Yosemite review and
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.760]  It had finally gotten flushed from memory, but I hadn't been in Safari for a while
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.600]  I had been doing a lot of other stuff
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.360]  But yeah, those big giant red and images that are in that review can yeah can do that, too
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.080]  Yeah, that that was the first one that had gotten flushed and it was definitely noticeable
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.440]  I think it's super interesting too that they've gone
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.720]  They've so out now
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.960]  I don't want to say outclass but it's it's so noticeably faster than the iPhone 6 in any kind of benchmark because it has
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.480]  You know, it's it's a faster faster at single core and it has a third core
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.840]  Yep, and the GPU is more powerful because it has to push more pixels
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.160]  And I think it may I haven't looked at the specs closely enough
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:18.240]  But I think they may be like it an over power point where it's not just like the same speed is the iPhone 6's GPU
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.720]  But it just has to push more pixels. It's like it can push the more pixels and then some yeah
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:30.640]  And I got to talk to I just happened to be my seat in the event last week was right behind the I was like
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.960]  Front towards the front like fifth row on the left and the demo guys were all in front of me like right in front
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960]  of me where the the replay guys and
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.480]  Two rows in front of me were the pixelmator guys
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.880]  And I know the pixelmator guys because they've sponsored I think they've sponsored the show
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.080]  But I know they're sponsored during fireball many times and I've emailed them, you know ever since the 1.0 came out
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.200]  It was like wow somebody actually used, you know the core image and all these other cool Apple technologies to do the thing
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.080]  We've been talking about for 15 years and have an indie rival to Photoshop
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.040]  So I've known him by email, you know since forever first time we ever met in person
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.000]  I was awesome to be able to congratulate them in person because what do you know?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.040]  What a moment, you know, you get to be on stage at an Apple event and demo your app
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.200]  And it ends up I know the replay guys a little bit, too
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.640]  I didn't recognize their names when they first got called up, but they've sent me, you know
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.040]  Just eat, you know as the guy writes during fireball. They've sent me emails on various things over the years
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.040]  And you know, we were right there in town hall
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.240]  we had a couple minutes before they were gonna kick us out and they're you know, they're not gonna just
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.760]  Give me any kind of state secrets about what what life was like the last couple of weeks while they were working on this
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.360]  But they you know
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.800]  They could speak a little bit and both of them like the replay guy said that he thinks if anything
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.280]  Apple has completely undersold the graphics performance of the a8x
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.960]  that that
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:57.000]  when they you know from what they were doing the last couple weeks getting the demo together for replay that it was way faster than
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.640]  What Apple is saying compared to like the iPhone 6?
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.640]  That's the thing about the power in these like they're putting so much power into his iPad and building up to the next
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.000]  Sort of the next sort of big leap like that
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.840]  We're gonna have to we're gonna be able to get a different class of applications
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.020]  but especially for graphics performance the the different class of application that you can get is a
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:26.200]  Extremely graphically sophisticated game and you're never gonna really have one of those on the iPad air, too
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:33.200]  because it's the same reason like when you know when like watchdogs or you know, what like
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.360]  You know shadow of Mordor, I guess is a bad example because cross-platform but any like modern console game
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:45.240]  It's odd on the current generation consoles. There's no Wii port of those because the Wii is standard definition and incredibly weak
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:50.540]  and there is no way to scale a modern PlayStation 4 game that all the way down to
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:57.640]  Something that's that darn old like there's not you can't well, we'll just use fewer vertexes and lower resolution textures in the game run fine
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:04.000]  It's just not possible right? You cannot take a game and scale that so any game that takes full advantage of the a8x
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.140]  I don't know if you can make a version of that game that also runs on the
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:12.960]  249 dollar iPad mini with an a5 and 5 I'd like there's nothing you can do to the game to make it run on that
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.540]  And so like you're kind of stuck
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:21.380]  you can never make you can never make an app that can really take advantage of that GPU because really have to think either games or
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:26.300]  Like scientific imaging are the only two things that you could do really use the GPU like that
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.660]  So it's kind of it's kind of a shame that that you know
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:33.240]  I mean, I guess you can do core image effects really really fast and the you know
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.500]  The a5 can do core image effects the same ones just much slower and that's how you can get away with doing something like pixel
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.580]  Mater on both platforms, but games
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:46.160]  I feel like people are stuck there that that and also if you those type of games that that graphical
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.020]  Sophistication cost so much money to make you have to sell a lot of them and I'm not sure
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  that the touch interface is
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:59.040]  Sufficient to you know be it, you know to sell a game like a 500 million dollar game like destiny for the iPad
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.980]  I I don't know if you could you could sell that with if people are gonna be swiping on this
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.460]  This is great because now that I have a ten-year-old son
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:12.220]  I actually I'm familiar with just about every title that you've mentioned including destiny. Do you have did you end up getting a ps4?
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.100]  No, you know we have you got the free Xbox
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.100]  And it's I don't know what to do about it because I kind of feel like the PlayStation 4 looks like the better the more
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:26.540]  Time goes on looks like it's the better platform. Well, so do you have destiny? Yeah, we have it on the Xbox
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:34.340]  Yeah, so there you go. Yeah, pretty good game. Did have you played it? Uh, just just a toy around a little bit
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:38.540]  I it's you know, I'm total like the old man learning to play games
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:44.840]  But it's you know, it's really really graphically. You should you got an Xbox. You should check Xbox live arcade
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.840]  I think there was a version of crystal quest
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:51.020]  Tell you kid about it son. Let me tell you I was a kid
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:55.620]  This is what we played. Although you can't play crystal quest at the friggin thumbstick. It doesn't know but anyway, you need a mouse
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.620]  Yeah
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:02.660]  Do they really have it and it yeah, I believe I know maybe not on the Xbox one
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.380]  But way back when I'm either on the original Xbox or the 360
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:10.580]  Cassidy and green I think it was the actual real company made part of crystal quest for Xbox
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.740]  I do think I do think though that this is
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:17.100]  Games in particular. I do think that they're really pushing
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:25.020]  Apple to open up the App Store to to hardware limit that the app somehow, you know if they already let you
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.980]  Limit it by OS. I just can't see why
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:34.980]  It's getting to be untenable as they extend the life of these, you know
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:40.960]  These devices and that's the thing that the as Alan Pike called it the zombie iMac
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.180]  that
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.140]  $249
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.140]  Retina not retina. I
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.260]  iPad mini the original iPad mini which is from two years ago is
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.220]  really from four years ago because the a5
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:03.900]  System on a chip and the 512 megabytes of RAM and everything is really it's the iPad to shrunken down like the house
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.220]  Yeah, I found 4s right. It wasn't the same generation as that. Yeah, it must have been around the 4a5
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:12.740]  Yeah, no, I know my iPod touch is the same thing 512. Thanks for him a5, right?
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:20.580]  So they've actually it's just in a weird way. Like they've actually the lineup. I think only has a
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:26.700]  It goes a5 at 249, but then there is no a6 iPad left
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.780]  They're already gone
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.260]  so
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.400]  It's it's like a year behind
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:39.580]  An extra year behind than the next step up. It's it's a really old piece of technology
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.500]  Yeah
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:45.540]  Yeah, I don't know like and again we've said this we keep saying this every time you know
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.900]  Who in metal came out and now the 8x or it's like and the Apple TV?
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:53.780]  To get playing video games on your television through an Apple device
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:58.620]  It's like just sitting there in front of Apple for you. Yeah, like they've got they've got every single freaking piece of the puzzle
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.820]  They just don't have the desire to do it, but just fine. Like you can't be in every business
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.260]  Maybe they don't feel like they want to enter that fray
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:11.220]  But as they accumulate the pieces especially with metal and the Apple TV and like they're building their own arm chips with these crazy
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.500]  GPUs in them
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:17.500]  Like I I don't necessarily recommend that they go for it because I don't think they're really equipped to compete in that space
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.040]  But it's just so weird to see them. It's kind of like when it was back at the e-book
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:28.380]  Donning of the e-book era around 2001 2002 and I was like Apple's got these iPods and they've got a way to sell things
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.380]  digitally online with the iTunes Store and
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:35.100]  And like they have all the pieces to dominate the e-book space like they basically, you know
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.940]  I think this maybe even before the Kindle came out
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.900]  It's like or maybe around the same time the Kindle was ink. It wasn't quite the same thing
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:44.660]  It's like why is Apple not, you know, the e-book market is there for the taking for Apple
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.440]  They have all the pieces they have the momentum they could they could do it
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.220]  They're just not interested and eventually they kind of like yeah, I guess we'll do ebooks, too
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.020]  But then it was too late
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:57.020]  Amazon was a dominant player and iBooks is kind of it also ran and the gaming space obviously has been
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:02.740]  Heavily populated for years and years, but here's Apple just dutifully working to essentially build the ingredients of a world-class
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:09.540]  Gaming console platform and then just not not doing that. Yeah, it's it like you said it's laying right in front of them
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:14.420]  Because the a8x I think the a8 is probably pretty good and you could make it
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:19.480]  Reasonable gaming console out of it especially with metal
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.640]  Which you know again talking to you know developers
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:32.060]  You know it Apple calling it ten times faster than OpenGL seems fair. It seems like in you know real-world
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:38.820]  That's a BS. Well, it's it's 10x and like, you know, if you do something stupid and you just measuring draw calls
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.380]  It's like it's a it's a micro benchmark
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:44.500]  But like but the thing is that type of low level API every game console has something like that
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:47.480]  Like Apple Apple has its own something. Well, that's the quick
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.380]  That's the that's the advantage Apple to modern Apple today has is that they have enough
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:57.480]  Developer support and so many customers that they can get developers to use their thing
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.900]  To port like to port all their game engines, you know that unity and unreal for engine everything
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.040]  Like we'll make a port solely for you know, so they can sell iOS guys, right?
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.180]  Because that's that's a big market. They make a lot of money off that so all those engines are say yeah, hell yeah
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:09.380]  well
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:14.620]  We'll make a port of our engine to metal and then everybody who builds games on our engine will be able to take advantage of it
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.620]  And like like to build a full-fledged
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:23.060]  console either they have to do something like wimpy like the not wimpy but like lower powered like the PlayStation TV or something because the
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:29.500]  8x is not going to compete in power with the PlayStation 4 it but there's no but there's no reason that Apple couldn't build a
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.780]  Device that competes with the PlayStation 4 it would not be just an 8x in a box
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.900]  but like by making the 8x and metal and having a store and
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:42.740]  talking to game developers and getting the engines ported to their technology shows that if they wanted to
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:48.220]  they could make a product like this that is of similar power to the PlayStation 4 wherever the next generation is and
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:51.940]  Decide to compete in that space. I don't they just don't want to which is fine
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.180]  like it's all about what do you say yes to what he's saying into it like that their recent Tim Cook interview where he keeps
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:59.580]  Saying like there's plenty of things we could do we have plenty of great ideas
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.260]  And we don't we don't not doing them because we're not capable of them
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:06.700]  They just choose what they want to do and thus far they have not made this choice just like for all those years
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:13.660]  They chose not to enter the e-book market so well or even honestly even chose not to enter the phone market I mean people were
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:20.040]  Clamoring for an Apple phone ever since cell phones became consumer priced items
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:26.120]  Yeah, well that's the biggest like they hadn't figured out what they wanted to do for a phone you like that right different competing internal
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.900]  Projects everything whereas the game console the reason you don't do is like well
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:33.060]  We just gonna make another game console like everybody else like they've seen like they don't want to enter the space until they feel like
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:38.060]  They have something significant to add right and with the iPhone they didn't enter the phone space like they did the Motorola rocker and all
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.540]  That silliness, but they didn't feel their own phone. That was just like a candy bar phone, right?
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:46.920]  They didn't enter the space until they had something right so even though their candy bar phone would have been the best candy bar phone
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:52.580]  They just didn't right and that would that would have hamstrung them because that would have made it interesting the iPhone harder because then you
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.460]  Got a transition people what about my old Apple phone? I liked it
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.180]  What is this new thing blah blah blah whereas if the iPhone is your first phone?
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.460]  No problems I and lastly the the performance thing and you know again
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:06.460]  I don't often go to benchmarks when I write reviews
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:13.060]  But I really just think it's so fascinating how quickly the high-end iPad is gaining on the low-end
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.340]  MacBook Airs and
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:22.740]  Again, it's not apples to apples because OS 10 and iOS have so many different interface things and just rules about multitasking
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:27.420]  And how much stuff can be going on in the background and how much RAM you get like a MacBook Air with like 16
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:30.260]  exactly which can have an
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.620]  enormous
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:36.860]  Performance you know especially not not even benchmark, but just real-world you know benchmark
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.940]  You know real-world advantages because when you're switching between these things
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:41.940]  You know they're all still in memory
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.700]  And I would have to think the the SSD storage in the air is also fast like I think this is the first generation of
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:52.180]  iOS products to use PCI Express for the the SSD connections, and I had heard that as a vague thing
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:56.800]  I haven't seen like an iFixit teardown right that's the case, but like but they've been doing that on MacBook Airs for a while
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.780]  But but yeah like I heard I saw I saw a thing on Twitter last night again not verified
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:06.980]  It's I didn't it's not like somebody showed pictures of it, but yeah somebody seemingly reliable said it's PCI Express
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:14.820]  Which is you know it's desktop. You know when they say desktop class performance. They've there's they're actually they're not hyping it
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.180]  They're they're being serious
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:21.860]  And that's what like that's the gates that type of stuff the more boring stuff if you're not playing a game the thing that gates
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:25.020]  Your performance on just using your iOS device is
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:29.980]  Amount of memory you have and how fast the storages because what do you think it's doing when you're launching an app and quitting an
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:31.980]  App and launching this app like
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.780]  It's not the CPU is mostly spending its time waiting for IO during during those times when you're waiting well
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:43.140]  Yeah, which is exactly why I splurged and got the the SSD storage for the iMac
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:48.820]  I feel like my last spinning hard disk that I've ever bought. You know is in the past I
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:55.320]  Would like mine to be in the past, but they're not getting well other than external drives that I would use for like backup
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.220]  Or something like that where I'm not going to be waiting on it as a as a user even then like at work
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.880]  My machine has SSDs for all the stuff that I use but my super duper clone is spinning
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.700]  And it's just so painful like how long a super duper clone takes just
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:16.500]  You know it's just like read from the SSD, and then just like go get a coffee. Oh you the spinning hard disk, okay?
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.820]  I'll read one more thing from the SSD like you just see super duper
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:23.520]  So it's so asymmetrical so I would love to be all SSD, but unfortunately I keep
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.240]  Accumulating stuff and SSD is set up for the read hit the reset button unlike
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.000]  Storage used to be scaling with my with my digital hoarding and then SSDs were like oh
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.920]  No, I actually set you back shrunk everything way back now. It's just now barely catching up again with one terabyte SSD
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.320]  All right, let me take a third break here and thank our last
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.260]  Sponsored another longtime friend of the show our good friends at Squarespace, and they've got
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.740]  a brand new Squarespace 7
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.340]  It's an all-new interface to Squarespace
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.580]  You don't have to do anything you just it's not like a new product you have to sign up for if you were already on
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.980]  Squarespace you can just opt in to get the new interface
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.040]  But they've done an enormous amount of work
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:13.140]  It's a huge upgrade and it all of it is to make things simple simpler and easier
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:18.500]  While retaining the power and complexity of the Squarespace platform right so what is Squarespace?
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.540]  It's you need a website you go to Squarespace you sign up and now you have a website
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:29.100]  And they aim to solve all the basics of your online identity by providing easy beautiful solutions
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:36.120]  For your website for email for images logos domains you can do your domain registration for them
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.500]  and
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.580]  Everything that they've learned from the millions of websites
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.020]  And that's they have millions of websites people have built using
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:51.300]  Squarespace and they've looked at where people were getting stuck with what Squarespace was before and they've addressed it so some of the new features
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.300]  They've added in Squarespace 7 they have
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.500]  Title pages cover pages so if you want to put like even brand your product
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.060]  You're you're using Squarespace to promote your pot
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:06.580]  You got a brand new feature you can add a cover page sort of like what Apple does with their home page
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:14.220]  You can have a cover page that people will see and click through before they go to you know your regular home page all
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:21.060]  Of their editing stuff they do instead of going into a separate mode when you're logged in you can just drag and drop to edit
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:27.060]  Right there on your actual website. It's a lot more WYSIWYG your website will look exactly like you arrange it
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.900]  You don't have to have one window where you're in editing mode and a second window where it shows it
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:35.180]  And you have to keep switching between the two windows and reloading to see it
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:41.620]  You just do it right there in place. They have new taste maker templates
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:49.020]  They're working with cool musicians artists architects and chefs to develop new templates that cater to each of those professions
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.220]  so
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:56.700]  Whatever field you're in whatever you're building a website to promote. They're expanding the range of templates that are automatically
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.220]  laid out
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:02.500]  To integrate with what you need to give you an interface
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:09.140]  That's exactly what you would want if you are say setting up a restaurant a restaurant website all sorts of cool stuff like that
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:15.540]  Where do you go to find out more easy you go to Squarespace.com?

[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.100]  So, let's talk Yosemite for the rest of the show
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:42:00.180]  Sure 140 in let's start my son calls it yozumite
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.980]  Yep
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.260]  Yazamite I think he says
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:08.220]  This is exactly as funny
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.320]  I didn't think about kids but that was exactly like what people said coming out of
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:17.580]  WWDC's the keynote is people don't know how to spell Yosemite people don't know what Yosemite is and then when my son
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:19.900]  Started talking about yazamite. I was like
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.060]  Huh? Well, it doesn't really matter
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:28.280]  It's free, it's not like they need to sell it to people I think the
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:35.380]  Visual thing I if it is anything that maybe I thought you underplayed was talking about the visual redesign
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.260]  Because I know you care
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.300]  But it's it's also a hard thing to talk about
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:46.020]  You think I underplayed I spent a lot of words in that that's like the longest section in the review
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:50.020]  I could have been longer in my opinion. Uh, uh
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:54.580]  It's because you know what I guess the other thing too is that you
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:58.000]  You know that they're not we're gonna have something
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:01.860]  They're gonna improve it and next year's will look a little better and it'll look a little better
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:06.500]  But you know, I think you know, this is basically what we're looking at for the next, you know
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.540]  At least probably a decade on the Mac
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:18.120]  Yeah, probably like I I forget what I put it in my review and what I cut but one of the things I mentioned in
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  the most recent ATP is like
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.920]  There's this thing that Apple does when they have a new
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.320]  Fancy design that they like they did it with iOS 7
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:32.960]  They did it with the original aqua and and 10 they did it with you know, the various looks in between like brushed metal
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:41.800]  They tend to err on the side of going too far. Yeah with look and then they back it off later in response to complaints
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:46.000]  And so like I was ever the most recent memory where they have a super thin fonts, right?
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.360]  And everything was just you know
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.880]  Maybe a little bit too precious and the parallax effect and the zoom and everything and so you add the thing to reduce motion
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.360]  You thicken up the font a little bit and you make adjustments and that was mostly done before release with with aqua
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.440]  the original version of 1010 was just crazy pinstripes everywhere super glossy and lickable all
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:12.400]  Faded and soft lighting like everything was shot with Vaseline on the lens and they backed that off over years hardening up the edges
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:18.720]  Towing down the pinstripes and then brushed metal came in and everything was freaking metal and the version of toning that down was getting rid
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.480]  of it, but like going too far and then backing off is
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.160]  Preferable to them it seems then not going far enough like being timid
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:31.000]  So Yosemite is and and I kind of bemoan that and the review or the part that I cut from the review
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:37.240]  That I don't know what's in there anymore is saying like wouldn't it be nice if we could skip that part where they go too far
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.200]  And just go right to the part where they tone it down a little bit and maybe they feel like they don't know where they
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.760]  Need to tone it down like the checkbox to make the menu bar not translucent
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.660]  Yeah, because the translucent menu bar the original one in leopard was just crazy translucent
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:54.160]  It made everything on read totally and now now they feel like they have the confidence that like well
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:56.160]  This menu bar won't be unreadable because we have this crazy
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:00.840]  Algorithm that will like blurry thing together and is aware of contrast and it would just look muddy and indistinct
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.120]  But it won't be unreadable. So no more checkbox to disable that it's like
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.840]  you know
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.560]  There are places where they went too far in this and there there are a bunch of adjustments that are already there
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.280]  But none of them sort of none of them tune it to be the way we hope it's going to be in the next two
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.280]  Revisions. Yeah, that's it. I
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.960]  Few hours before the show started I linked to koi VIN's
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:28.920]  review of Yosemite, you know mote focusing solely on the appearance and I know you hurt my feelings said it was your favorite, uh,
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.480]  Well, I that's it. Yours doesn't even count. I mean yours is
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.880]  Anyway, yeah. No, I read this thing when he originally posted but yeah, but I mean it's a similar sentiment
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:45.200]  Yeah, it always 10 Balboa and OS 10 palisades are gonna look great. And I think that is totally true. I'm I'm
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.400]  basically on board completely with the
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.960]  The basic style but there's definitely some toning back that I think needs to be done
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.800]  also, my big complaint that I just complain about ATP is like the
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.920]  Transparency effect like I spent a lot of time explaining
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.640]  What the different kinds of transparency are how they work and then here's how they're deployed in the OS
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.800]  Right and all the stuff about the rearrangements of the UI stuff like that
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.840]  And then I had this whole section called philosophy
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.840]  Which is I kind of tried to isolate the part where I'm gonna like try to unpack this like here's what it is
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.280]  Here's what it's look like. Here's where they use it. And then it's like why why why is this there at all?
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.360]  What is it about what's behind my menu bar that adds to my life, right? And you know, why do I need to see that?
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.600]  Why didn't I need to see any of that, right?
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:34.600]  What is you know, like because there's always some kind of philosophy behind it like a regiment with the original aqua. It was like
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.280]  Transient elements were translucent. Yeah, so sheets just appear briefly and go away
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:47.560]  Yeah, drop down menus appear briefly and go away. Those are translucent. It's it's a temporary and it yeah, there's a logic to it
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.440]  Right, but then on the other hand the dock which was always there was also translucent
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.640]  So it's just like well if you translucency is cool, right?
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:47:00.000]  So and here like, you know several times I've asked Apple about the effects and during the different keynotes
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.580]  They've said here's why we do it and they have reasons behind them and I have to like look at those reasons and say like
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:10.360]  Is this a reason for you to pollute all of my sidebars with the color of the desktop background?
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.320]  like
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:17.640]  sometimes that their justification can work out but other times I'd like I don't buy it like the whole thing of making the the
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:22.860]  You know that the temperature and mood of your desktop background influence the look of your OS sounds like I mean
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:24.860]  It's a thing that happens
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:29.960]  It works like if you if you have a super orange desktop background all of your your you know
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:35.680]  Behind window blending translucent regions are gonna have a tinge of orange in them. Your menu bar is gonna be tinged orange
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.560]  All the menus put you pulled down are gonna be tinged orange, right?
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.600]  but like I
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.580]  don't you know that that aspect of personalization like
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:47.880]  It maybe just flies in the face of
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.480]  Tradition or whatever like if I have a desktop picture that I want
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.760]  I want my gleaming beautiful interface to be on top of it
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.080]  I don't want the desktop picture like I may like it because it's a nice picture
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:03.200]  I like it, but I don't like is its contribution to the sidebar of my email client that now looks like a muddy rusty
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.800]  Tinged orange thing whereas before it was crisp text on top of a background color that the app designer
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.800]  Yeah, it's it changes what it means to pick a desktop picture because before it was okay
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.220]  What do I want to see when I've got nothing open like I'm done like let's say like as you complete your what you have
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:22.200]  To do today you keep closing windows and you're closing tabs and you know
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.420]  You can quit your email because I'm not gonna check it again
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:29.240]  And now I've got nothing and I'm looking at my desktop and this is a picture that makes me happy
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.400]  That's all you had to do when you chose your desktop
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:40.000]  Now you've got to pick something that's going to make like you said like make the sidebar in your email client look good when you
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.640]  Don't even see the desktop and and then this is a point I have to have to put it in ATP terms
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.520]  I have to do some follow-up because when guy was on last week guy English and we talked about this
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:51.380]  We clearly confused the hell out of a lot of people
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:57.220]  And because we were talking about the way that if you have like a stack of white windows
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.540]  just like text edit documents and then you have like mail in front of them and
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:08.460]  The sidebar of mail behind it is just a white window. It still takes a tint from the desktop
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:15.460]  That's what guy and I were talking about and that does in terms of not merely making any kind of logical sense in the world
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.220]  of physics
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:22.180]  We weren't what everybody seemed to think we said was that it doesn't take any cues from what's right behind it
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:29.180]  So if it's mostly it's mostly what's behind us with a touch of the desktop. It's mostly what's behind it directly in the window behind it
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:31.460]  So if you have like a real vibrant purple
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.940]  Image you know grimace from McDonald's is in the window behind you and your mail is in front of it
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.940]  You're gonna have a purple sidebar
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:45.900]  But I end up a lot of times with a lot of white windows, you know
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:50.160]  I have editing documents and stuff like that or a male client or I chatters
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:50.500]  Yeah
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:54.580]  But but but god forbid you have like a safari window with it with like a dark black
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:50:01.020]  Blob and then some white stuff then the black blob starts showing right and if it's not like it not like an entirely black window
[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:03.660]  Where it just makes the whole thing look great if it's just right in the middle
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:05.740]  There's looks like there's a smudge
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:09.900]  I see it in the messages app every day with when I have transparency on
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:11.900]  because there's
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:17.300]  My blue messages are always on the side. And so up at the top, right? There's this blue
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:24.260]  Blur about it, you know ranging from like an inch or two that doesn't extend across the whole bar and it bothers the hell out
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.020]  of me
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:31.340]  Yeah, here's the analogy used on ATP last night, which I probably should also put in the review but didn't
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:37.860]  So there's this whole central section on extensions and I go I go through a little bit about the the old days of extensions where?
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:43.660]  they would just invade the memory space of either the OS or other applications and even into the OS 10 days of just like
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.980]  You know every app that launches loads the scripting edition
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:49.380]  Which just like runs wild in its memory space and does some crazy hack to you know
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:53.860]  Enable window shade or whatever. It's gonna do right and the idea that
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:57.420]  you would write a program as an application developer and
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:03.460]  Then you would test it and debug it and make sure it works correctly and then hand it to somebody and then someone else
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:09.140]  who you'd never met write a program that invades your program and changes the way it works and causes a bug in your program and
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:13.620]  Then you get like a support ticket or the hey, you're you're you're a text editor has a bug and it's like well
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:15.060]  No, I totally test that it doesn't it's like oh
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:20.620]  I'm running this extension and and this thing written by someone you never met invades your application and changes the way it behaves and
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:27.260]  Now it's buggy. You got to fix it. It's an untenable way to develop software because how can you it's like the halting problem?
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:32.180]  How can I know what's gonna happen when some program I've never seen before invades my program and changes the way it's behaved
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.900]  It's impossible for me to write a quote-unquote correct bug-free program in this environment
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:41.100]  The develop the designer equivalent of that is I'm gonna make an application
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.500]  I'll make it look as good as I want
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:46.100]  But I have no control over what windows are behind it or what color the person desktop background is
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:50.420]  I just got a trust Apple to try to make this into something readable and then I get back to the you know
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:55.860]  Why why is it? What is it about the sidebar? Like I could I can I can buy pull-down menus
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.500]  I can buy sheets I can buy
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:02.700]  You know transient things that are floating in but the sidebar seems so a part of the content of the application
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:07.660]  Like maybe if it was a slide-out drawer like the old style ones that I could say it was transient and maybe it should be
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:12.820]  Translucent, but there is nothing about sidebars that says to me. Please show me what's behind you right?
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:17.300]  Like they're filled with text like they're source lists. They're text that has to be readable
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.560]  I do not want to be distracted by the other stuff there
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:25.820]  And so I mean, I don't know there's no option to turn that off except to turn off everywhere and I pretty much at this
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:29.840]  Point, I feel like I'm I can on board with the way they use translucency even with the stupid
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:34.380]  Tinging and all the drop them and use everywhere except for sidebars because it just seems like a bridge too far
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:37.500]  The other thing that I don't get I don't get the other use of it
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:42.620]  I don't get the in window transparency, you know, like in Safari where all the chrome at the top of the Safari when yeah
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:47.460]  There's a little bit more justification that of their own doing as I said
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:50.420]  I'm pretty sure I said this in the review once they made scroll bars invisible
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:55.700]  the only way you have any indication that there's stuff above or below is if you see something truncated or if you kind of
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.540]  See this dim, you know
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:01.640]  wavy image of things that are above or below and that bothers me less because
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:07.900]  Toolbars tend to have a stronger boundaries like the toolbar buttons themselves. Don't let stuff show through on them
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.400]  So they're gonna be you know, light dark markings on light backgrounds well-defined
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.860]  there's nothing in the toolbar itself that I need to read that's going to become illegible and
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.500]  Like just scrolling through the review
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.660]  Like you can kind of see the reason they did this and it's one of the one of the justifications of philosophy section
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.220]  Is that this looks nice like that?
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:32.020]  It's fashion that it's aesthetics and if you scroll through my Yosemite review and when I look at some of these screenshots
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:38.720]  I think some of them are really pretty like that the multiple docks with the different backgrounds or even when I'm trying to show
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:41.860]  Something that I think is a negative like the same Safari window
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:47.420]  Well, I just changed tabs and it radically changes what the entire interface looks like because the pages are half scrolled up behind the scroll
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:50.900]  Bar that is a little bit crazy, but the image is beautiful
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.940]  I think like this has the most interesting screenshots because of the all, you know
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:56.500]  I I purposely tried to
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:02.500]  Show things in both the best and the worst light like get it to be most aesthetically pleasing but show what the extremes are. I
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:09.140]  Think it is a really interesting thing to do and but I can only excuse it as long as it doesn't start impinging on
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:15.740]  Usability when it does impinge on usability, but I have a good reason other than in some scenarios looks really good
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:19.140]  I know in your scenario, it's ugly and you can't turn it off. But in some scenarios, it looks good
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:22.140]  Right and that that boss still bothers me
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:22.300]  Yeah
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:22.780]  well
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:30.140]  And I just I guess I like the in window transparency a little bit more than the behind window transparency because there's a little bit
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:36.180]  More like you said with the scrolling and a sense of hey, there's stuff up there. There's some kind of logic to it
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:41.380]  Whereas the sidebar transparency, it just just seems mindless to me. So I think and I've been
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:46.300]  as I've gone full-time Yosemite, I think I'm probably going to
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.620]  run with the the
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.500]  reduced transparency option
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:56.620]  And yeah, and that bothers me because that I think I mean it does as I pointed out in the review it
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:59.300]  It does look okay like that. Like it still looks handsome
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.820]  It shows that this is a sturdy design that does not rely on
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:08.340]  Transparency parlor tricks to look nice because it looks it looks perfectly nice and it's solid especially on retina screens with sort of fine
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.620]  Hair lines about things that contrast is still a little bit low
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:15.300]  But otherwise it shows that there's there, you know, there are sturdy bones underneath this design
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:21.020]  But it's a shame to give up all the transparency effects that I like just to save that one that I don't like and the other
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:24.980]  Thing that bothers me about reduced transparency is those are in the accessibility preference pain, right?
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:30.380]  And those things are there to help make the interface more usable for people who need that
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:37.020]  But I feel like designers are not sweating as much over what things look like with that turned on both third-party and Apple designers
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:41.760]  Like that it that it looks clunkier that looks more like like in this way that Windows is like well
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.460]  We'll just do this and I'm sure to look fine and you look at it and there's like details in our ride
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.420]  They're sweating over what it looks like in the default mode
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:53.940]  I don't think people are sweating over how any application looks with reduced transparency on like right down to like the overlays for volume changing
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.940]  With it where the little corners don't have transparency in some situations. Have you seen that? I don't think so
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.940]  Let me see. I should have told you about
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:07.540]  Yep, so now now can you leave that option on like it's totally counter to the super Apple nerd aesthetic
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:11.580]  Everything has to be beautiful and elegant like that stuff like that is around if you know where to look for it
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:18.540]  That's hard because because accessibility is not meant to be like it's it's first and foremost is supposed to make it more usable at the expense
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:23.940]  Of you know, perfect aesthetic beauty. So yeah, there is one of your expenses. Maybe you'll think more about that option
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:26.900]  Yeah, so when you change the volume and you get that what is that like a HUD?
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:32.060]  What would you call it the temporary overlay the rounded corners are just filled in with black
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:39.980]  Because it it's the transparent part of whatever that thing I gotta call that I bet that's a bug that they'll fix but it's it's
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:43.620]  A definite sign but that type of thing like if you were to file that as a bug
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.820]  Hey when I enable this accessibility option, this thing doesn't look as nice
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:53.140]  They're gonna be like, yeah, but it's it's you know, it's more it's it's a bit easier to see right stuff doesn't show through, right?
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:58.180]  That's the point of the accessibility feature. So feel free to file that bug. See if they close it as behaves correctly
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:00.180]  I will I will I
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:04.980]  Think like you said I would love to be able to pick and choose and just turn it off on the sidebars because I like
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:09.300]  The transparency on the menus. I think it it makes it looks good
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.700]  And it makes sense to me that it's temporary, you know
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:16.980]  It's it's just a little thing that while I choose this menu command is floating over my thing
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:20.380]  And now that they're solid I just checked it right here in front of me
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.740]  It's it doesn't look at the text rendering changes
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:28.200]  Especially on non-retina the text rendering changes when you go solid on the menus as well
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.900]  And the the menus the thing that bothers me about the menu is the tinge of the desktop
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.960]  like I like the overlays like the volume changer when
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:41.280]  Transparencies on the sort of iOS 7 overlay when you pull up control center from the but like it doesn't bring it doesn't pull any colors
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.280]  From your desktop background. It's just simply I am white slightly translucent with that cool blur effect
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.720]  I wish the menus were like that because all of my desktop pictures are making mine
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:53.000]  I pull them menus uglier like I'm gonna have to change them
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.860]  Even though I love the pictures that are there just to pick one that has a different dominant color
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:02.880]  So the dominant color I can you know stomach the side of in all of my pull down menus. Did you turn on?
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.880]  increase contrast
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.640]  To play I haven't used it like that. I have to obviously I turned it on for screen. I feel like that one
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.360]  I got I know what you're saying that it looks like system six
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.760]  But it looks like system six made by someone with not a lot of attention to detail as things collide with each other and there's no
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:23.040]  Spaces between things because they just sort of draw with a magic marker over the edges and don't read they don't change the metrics
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.320]  So it's like crowded. There's a whole bunch of things that I think look better
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:32.240]  And a whole bunch of things that clearly look worse just in terms of whether it's pleasing to me
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:36.200]  And I realize like you said this is it is under accessibility for a reason
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:40.180]  I can actually see clearly how it is an accessibility feature for some people
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:43.720]  But I actually like some of the the details of it
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.080]  But there's others that you know, I can't there's no way I could rock it full-time
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.720]  It's and and the low contrast that like it's basically the default where everything is super low contrast
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.560]  Doesn't it remind you speaking of ie5 like the days when we were all using bitmap fonts and everything was like well
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:03.520]  You're still doing it like a light gray text on a dark gray background and you know and and 10-point Verdana
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:08.920]  Pixel fonts and every like everything was super low and you could just make it so precious and beautiful
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.720]  But then when you when you move back from the screen
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.240]  It just faded into a uniform gray haze and you don't notice it so much in Yosemite until you turn on
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.440]  Increased contrast you're like, whoa
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:23.000]  those hairlines now jump out at me and now there's clear delineations and like the toolbar buttons don't fade into the toolbar as much as
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.480]  They used to like it goes too far on the other direction
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:28.680]  But you only notice the low contrast of Yosemite
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.120]  When you turn on the high current and then turn it back off. You're like, whoa
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:32.520]  No
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:36.860]  I feel like I just my night vision went out and now everything's fading into one big blur again
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.160]  one of the things that most surprised me about Yosemite when they unveiled it at WWDC was that
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:49.140]  The general control I call it a control panel system press panel where you control the basic appearance stuff
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:52.880]  You know graphite and blue highlight color and stuff like that. I
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:56.280]  I my gut feeling was that they were gonna get rid of all that
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.240]  Just as you know go more like iOS like you don't get to pick a highlight color in iOS
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:05.760]  You're gonna get blue and you're gonna like it or the app is going to override it
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.560]  You don't get to pick whether you get blue or gray as a highlight color
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:15.120]  You don't get to pick the color that get you know, when you select text what color is the highlight of the text?
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:18.120]  That's the other thing about increased contrast. It changes your highlight color, too
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:23.960]  Yeah, it's something that I seemingly can't quite figure out how what the rules are for. I
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:29.600]  Thought they were gonna get rid of all that because I thought that was sort of that's such an old-school
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.200]  Consumer, you know
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.880]  Feature you know that you get like the way windows used to let you pick everything, you know
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:49.200]  You can totally design, you know blue with with white trim or you know, you can make windows look just truly god-awful
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.760]  But they'd let you do it
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:57.080]  But the thing they have in there the things they have in there are there for reasons that haven't changed like for the whole reason
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.360]  graphite is there is
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:04.520]  because like they're essentially bowing to pressure from graphic designers who felt like the candy colors were throwing off their color sense and
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.280]  They they you know as I think I pointed out the review
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:14.320]  There's such a such a multi-year big fu to all those designers who were like you've got to get these candy colored aqua
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:19.640]  We just out of our face. It's totally destroying my ability to you know, because colors look different when the next to other colors
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:24.840]  I need something that's neutral or whatever. So Apple said fine. Here's graphite and they gave they made everything a blue tinged gray
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.920]  Which was it would just worse
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.040]  I feel like for throwing off color balance because if you if your mind believes that it's actually neutral gray
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:35.520]  But it's not there's more blue in it. It's gonna screw you up way worse than primary colors red green and yellow
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.960]  We're gonna but I know now the gray is morning. I loved it though
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:43.620]  It was almost as though they let me pick like a blue tinted gray. It was like right down my alley
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:44.960]  Yeah, no
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.360]  But it like it doesn't it's not really what they asked for and somehow
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.320]  Now with graphite is now now much more neutral gray and it's totally boring
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:55.480]  But if for people who want something that's neutral, it's fine. But like no they went in the other direction like I said, okay
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.480]  we've got blue and graphite and
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.420]  Also, by the way, you can do this crazy dark mode that we sort of half-heartedly did to match our pro apps
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.920]  like again, you know that I asked about that and they're like
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:09.080]  They gave a bunch of different reasons for it
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.080]  But like the one that has the most weight is like
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:16.880]  Pro customers wanted this to match their pro applications that are also dark because they're like they're looking at video all day and they don't
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:19.880]  Want the white menu bar and dock staring them in the face. So here's a dark mode
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:25.080]  I but I thought as and you you must have stayed up to date with the betas over the summer
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:31.420]  I thought that they actually called it a dark mode and it seemed like a hint like when they unveiled it on stage at
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:38.440]  WWDC that it would be almost like everything windows that all sorts of stuff was going to go dark
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:41.620]  Well, so there's a couple reasons why they didn't do that
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:46.740]  Like early on in the in the betas in the general control panel thing
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:51.940]  Like the same control was there but instead of being a checkbox. It was a theme pop-up menu
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:55.380]  So it was like I forgot what the words were like whatever word is next to the graphite aqua picker
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:03:00.580]  And then there was another picker that it was a pop-up menu of like theme and it was like regular and dark
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.060]  All right, and that became a checkmark which is kind of demotes it from like oh, this is not theming
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:11.220]  This is not OS theming. This is just a checkmark option that tweaks how certain things look and you can't go full dark
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:15.420]  I think for the same reason that even just making the menu bar dark was a problem because now you have all these
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:20.980]  Third-party and you know Apple's own in the beginning menu bar icons that draw incorrectly
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:22.840]  when when because they you know
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:28.080]  Because they drew draw black on top of black and you couldn't see anything and Apple's own had to be updated and the third-party ones
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:32.620]  Had to be updated multiply that problem by about a bazillion if you tried to change the entire interface to dark
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:36.420]  How many applications draw with black and if you put them on a black background, everything's invisible
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:40.380]  So that was just not gonna happen like the appearance manager in those days
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:44.080]  You had ways to you know, if everyone was using the appearance manager
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.100]  You could make sure that your app look good on any possible crazy kaleidoscope, right?
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.860]  Because you didn't you if you embrace the appearance manager, you never pick you never said draw black text
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:55.220]  You said you always drew with like a theme brush or whatever, right?
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:59.700]  You would say give me the text color and now draw in text color and you didn't have to know what text color was
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.900]  Whereas now you see a lot, you know
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:04.100]  There's clearly gonna a lot of apps that like yeah
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:08.060]  I mean cocoa was like cocoa was not made with that in mind and you know
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:11.860]  Certainly when jobs came back the theme stuff was canned even though the API's were still there
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:16.820]  And so like, you know as I talked about there was there was this brief period where it's explosion of theming on the Mac community
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:21.820]  But like even though that tech was there and people took advantage of it jobs was against it pretty much closed the door on that
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:28.220]  And now you have an ecosystem of applications that are not prepared to be on a system where the system look changes in radical way
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:31.980]  I mean, it's hard enough for Apple when they change the look to make sure like, you know
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:33.980]  If you drew a custom control now, it looks wrong and everything
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:36.580]  And there's all sorts of other I don't know
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:39.860]  It's even after even though that they've cut it down and it's just used dark
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:42.460]  menu bar and dock
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:49.140]  It's like the the selection cut the highlight color for the menus in the in the dark mode
[02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:51.660]  It it's not right to me
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:56.940]  Yeah, that's another you know vibrancy attempt because it's got tinge with the desktop background
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:02.240]  But also like a you know, sort of inverted type thing. It's it's weird and sometimes looks a little you know
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:07.280]  It looks a little sickly. Sometimes it doesn't you know, it doesn't it doesn't have the pizzazz of like
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:14.260]  their big theme in the regular the regular look is this very light gray lighter than normal not a lot of gradient to it and
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.400]  this really powerful kind of like
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:21.520]  It's like if Pepto Bismol was blue instead of pink. That's what the blue looks like. All right
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:26.760]  It's like really like chalky thick opaque blue and that's your highlight color
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:32.680]  Whereas when you go dark mode and just kind of becomes this like pale moonlight that's shining on your selected element
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:38.120]  It is not doesn't make as powerful a statement. Yeah, and it doesn't even invert the color of the text
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:42.120]  So I mean and you're seeing that because you're running in in graphite mode
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.080]  That's what we're talking about here in case people are confused
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:48.560]  If you run in non change your thing from non graphite and change the dark mode and then pull down a menu
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:53.800]  It looks much more. It looks much stronger in that. Yeah, it looks horrible in graphite mode
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.440]  It looks okay in blue mode
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:59.440]  But it still doesn't change the color of the text though like in regular mode
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:02.720]  When you have like you you hover your mouse over the new
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:09.160]  You know file new then new goes from being written in black to being written in white because the blue is so vibrant
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.480]  but in the dark mode, they don't change to like
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:16.520]  They don't invert the text. It's just yeah, cuz it's too it's too close
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:19.480]  It's not it's not clear that the background is so different that you know
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.400]  You have to invert like it's too and then it and that's that's all thing with the vibrancy effect
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:29.200]  We kept showing that WWDC like they would show that hey if you if you draw text with like it, you know again
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.240]  It's a you know, the text color everything drawn on a vibrant background
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.600]  We will adjust the color of the text to make sure that every part of the text has that has enough contrast to be readable
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.600]  And so the text color
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:46.000]  Changes because like behind what you can see behind the fiber and background is whatever the hell is behind it whether it's a window or
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.720]  The desktop background so you can't just pick one text color. You have to sort of
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:53.680]  adjust the text color as you go along in sync with the
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:59.640]  Whatever is behind it to make sure that this letter on the right side of this sentence is a totally different color than this
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:04.200]  Level on the left side because the thing that's behind it is different and they're trying to finesse that and again
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:08.200]  I have to ask why what's the point with Texas supposed to be readable?
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.680]  Just put it on a background where you could wear the developer of the application
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:16.920]  Control the foreground the background color and we can all read the friggin text. I don't need to see what's behind it. Why I
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:21.680]  Hear you I I'm surprised
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:25.840]  I'm still a little surprised that they even have all these options that they didn't just say, you know
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:29.440]  It's our way or the highway and you're gonna get well, I'm gonna get blue and you're gonna like it
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:35.340]  Yeah, so it took us from 10.0 to 10.5 for them to just like brush metal is gone
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:42.340]  Pinstripes are gone. There's one window style. The buttons look normal. Nothing is too transparent the menus
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:42.600]  I mean
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:48.740]  I remember they like the transparency have pulled on menus was so extreme in the beginning and then by the end like by a leopard
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:54.660]  And snow leopard timeframe. It was practically opaque. It's like why even bother at that point? Like I can't see anything through this
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:57.060]  It's almost entirely opaque white, right? So
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:59.740]  You know it in
[02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:00.820]  10.15
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:03.980]  Expect all this exuberance to have consolidated it into one
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:05.980]  more conservative
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:12.800]  Yet still recognizably Yosemite ish look. Yeah. Yeah, and there's a couple things they get right
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:15.840]  I think the new doc is great and I call that out
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:19.160]  Here's what you wrote in your review setting aside the particulars the Yosemite doc
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:25.400]  exudes a visual confidence that has been sorely missed in the last few releases of OS 10 like I
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:30.040]  To me the doc exemplifies what Yosemite is shooting for
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:35.480]  Yeah, and as I said an ATP, it's the ideal scenario for you to show off vibrancy
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:35.680]  Yeah
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:41.720]  Because the icons are so like you're not gonna lose them no matter what crazy crap is going on with the background
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:44.240]  Let me show the screenshot of like a look. It's look at how green it looks here
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.400]  Look at how blue looks here the icons stand so proud of that interface. They're not gonna get lost
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.400]  You're not trying to read a bunch of text
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.320]  And you have full freedom on that background where otherwise no information would be conveyed to show off
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:01.860]  Hey this cool effect that we've done this vibrancy thing where we blur and pull forward different colors and saturated. It looks beautiful
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:03.200]  It's interesting
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.040]  And it you know
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:10.760]  It conveys this is kind of a piece of glass or translucent thing laying over stuff like that is the ideal environment for this
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:14.840]  For this type of effect because it doesn't impair anything at all
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.800]  Really and even like the parts where you hover and you get the text those they gave dedicated backgrounds that say, okay
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:23.520]  Well now it's time for you to read text. I'm not gonna mess around here
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:28.320]  I'm going to give you what is almost, you know, a fairly opaque light colored background with dark, you know
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:33.320]  Text on top of it or the reverse in dark mode to make sure you can read the text for the hovers and everything like
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:38.700]  That but doc itself will just be like we finally figured it out. No more ridges. No more weird frills
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:43.960]  No down on an angle and shiny things on it. No reflections of the windows that are going above it like
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.380]  Yeah, it's been a long road for the dog
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:50.600]  I think the maverick stock is it's probably the best 3d doc cuz it kind of like that that you know
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.400]  Not brush metal look was I mean something else in the parlance of the Mac
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:58.680]  But like sort of a matte finish metal type of thing
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:01.520]  The 3d effect still just does not work and should never have been done
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:04.680]  But that one at least has the most class but I was like we're done with that phase
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.520]  Here's what the doc looks like. It looks the same vertical and horizontal. This is the doc
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.880]  They even got rid of pinning which is kind of a shame, but that was never a documented feature
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:15.700]  Anyway, what was Oh pinning top and bottom?
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:20.240]  Yeah, instead of having the doc centered on the edge of the screen people love to pin it to the top or the bottom
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.640]  I suspect that maybe one thing that they reverse on if they get a lot of complaints about it because even though it was
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.200]  Undocumented the people who have been doing it have been doing it since like, you know
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.920]  Whenever that whenever that undocumented feature was added whatever developer preview, that's you could say it's undocumented
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:39.160]  But once you've been doing it for you know, yeah, it was like a 10-15 years. It was like a defaults, right thing
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:42.400]  Yeah, did just it didn't have to hack it. You just give it a preference
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.640]  It was you know a preference that you just put in into terminal and and then I'm gonna take it
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.680]  I remember that come come that Apple doc pinning start or end or whatever. It was right
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.240]  What's that app from the guy in Germany? That's just it's just like a front end to all the hidden preferences
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:11:01.480]  I like secrets, which is from the guy who made quicksilver. Oh, right. Yes internet shared database of those type of things
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.560]  But there's a million applications that will you know, either show you what those commands are or run them for it. I
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.840]  Think and it again I I shouldn't say it's underplayed it because I think it's
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:16.280]  It's obvious but that this
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:21.440]  interface is so clearly defined just designed retina first and
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:27.320]  How it looks on non retina max is you know, we'll make the best of it
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:30.360]  But it's so clearly a retina first design
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.440]  And I guess I should have it should have been a sign like when we saw it at
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.320]  WWDC it should have been a sign that retina like this would be the year we're gonna get retina IMAX
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:49.060]  because I don't think it's a coincidence that they're debuting at the same time as an interface that so clearly is is
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:52.180]  Meant to be seen on on the retina display
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:55.540]  But even if we weren't getting a retina desktop max this year
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:58.660]  They still have to design it for retina like you have to be forward-looking, right?
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:02.060]  There's no sense in making a brand new look for the Mac at this point in time
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:04.660]  Even if retina are working to be out for two years
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:09.340]  You just have to you just have to say like you have to be forward-looking about this like which is why I hope to God
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:14.940]  Whatever new file system Apple must surely be working on is made entirely with SSDs in mind like screw spinning discs
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.940]  I know they're still around. I know people are gonna use them for years
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:20.740]  But if you're doing something now, you have to be forward-looking. Yeah, I totally agree
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:24.780]  Yeah, that's a good point that it would it would make sense
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:29.780]  It maybe even make it so that it doesn't even run on non s non SSDs and you know
[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:36.020]  It's still use a use HFS plus till the end of time on your spinning hard. Yeah, don't spook them. I just wanted to really something I
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:37.580]  I
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:42.040]  Think that the choice of Helvetica or as they say Helvetica Neue
[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:44.860]  in particular is
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:51.440]  Is the clearest sign that it's meant to be seen on retina first because as I look at Yosemite on a non retina MacBook Air
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:53.440]  It's the type that really
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:55.460]  Annoys, yeah
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:13:00.780]  People are upset that I didn't make more of that in my review and the reason I didn't make more of it is because I truly
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:02.420]  Believe most people will not even notice
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:06.580]  I know that is inconceivable to those of us who were like type nerds and I'm not even that big of a type murder
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:12.740]  But it bothers me because I have non retina max and it's just not like and you might you might have non retina max for a
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.460]  while
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:16.220]  Right, but but like but even I am not as bothered
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:20.140]  By it as you are and as many other people are but I truly think regular people
[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:25.100]  Will just absolutely not notice the texture even if you put it side by side
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:28.060]  They wouldn't notice because people are just not sensitive to that
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:33.260]  maybe if you had changed from like brush script to like, you know, Cairo people would notice but
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:37.180]  People just do not notice that you change from one sans-serif font to another
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:43.620]  I can notice I noticed that it's not really Helvetica Neue. It's it's a system font
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:48.540]  I still haven't found where it lives. It must be somewhere in slash system library
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.740]  It used to be available in the font menu in the early betas when they took it out of there
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:56.220]  But yeah, it's hiding in there and it's it's the mutant one not for any reason that like makes
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:14:00.940]  Sense from like well, we wanted to make a readable system us because they had to make the metrics match
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:04.780]  So it's kind of it's kind of perverted by the need right to match metric
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:10.660]  So I think it's basically uglier than it needs to be. So it's the same with our closest possible. Yeah, I think that's
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:17.500]  Exactly. It's well and it works a little better and it's a little bit of a concession or not even a little bit
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:21.980]  I actually know that they spent an awful lot of time once they decided. Okay, we're gonna go to Helvetica and
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:28.020]  We've still got all of these non retina max that we're gonna support for years to come and in some cases
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:31.580]  They might even be selling for years to come right that that you know
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:37.180]  Who knows when the Mac Pro is going to be able to support Apple branded retina displays?
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:42.620]  MacBook Air rumors say is gonna go retina soon ish, but
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:47.960]  It's you know, it's gotta support non retina for a long time
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.160]  they spent a lot of time tweaking the
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.200]  metrics not just to make it match Lucida, but also to
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:01.080]  Make sure that as you know that it fill at the sizes that it's used as a system font
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:04.920]  That it hits the pixel boundaries as often as possible
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.440]  Yeah
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:11.240]  Because otherwise you get ll and hello becomes just one big indistinct blurred looks like a really thick capital I or something, right?
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:13.840]  I can my favorite example. So there's a lot of a lot of apps
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:20.680]  It's a standard menu and cocoa the format menu in the menu bar. If you look at least on a retina display
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:26.600]  I don't know. I don't have a Yosemite non retina, but on the retina display at least the R and the M
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:33.000]  There's clearly some space between them. Whereas if you just open a text edit document set the font to Helvetica Noya
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:40.480]  It's like 16 or 18 or whatever it is and type the word format the R and the M are gonna touch and it's gonna look
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:44.520]  You know it unless you know, you know, it's just one of those you just have to know the word
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:49.760]  You can't tell which one's the M and with you know, it just all looks like a bunch of humps next to each other
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.320]  Yeah, it's not a ligature. You don't think it's not just the kerning, right?
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:58.280]  It's that the default kerning for Helvetica Noya is tight enough that the word format at that size
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.700]  Is the R and the M are gonna blur together, which is one of those things that people who don't like Helvetica
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:05.700]  don't like about
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:12.980]  What else like the word window even is sort of it kerns differently if you use real Helvetica Noya
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:16.380]  You know the way that the W that the slantiness of the W
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:21.660]  You know has space next to it with the I that the the dot AI isn't going to get lost in the W
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:29.740]  It's very thoughtful it makes me wonder why they don't use that I guess it's because of the metrics why like on iOS
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:34.900]  They just use Helvetica Noya. There's no special version of it for the system font to my knowledge
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:41.420]  Yeah, and the iOS line has but again with exceptionally these zombie iPad mini the iOS line has
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:48.900]  Been in retina longer. It's more of a comfortable type of thing and you know again forward-looking like we're gonna make these devices
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.020]  They're they're all gonna be retina soon enough because the screens are small enough
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:56.360]  We know we can do it design an interface especially iOS 7 like design an interface that is
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:05.200]  A that's that's may aimed at a world where all the devices are right because they're gonna be that way really soon. Yeah, um, one
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.640]  Of your I will finish with a little bit of Swift and then we'll call it a show because it's been a long time
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.600]  but I
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:17.760]  From your review here from my notes review on page 16 you wrote among a certain set of Mac enthusiasts
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:23.080]  It was a point of pride to have many rows of icons filling the startup screen now
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:28.880]  That's a reference to the classic Mac OS where you know, like when you just the whole section where you're talking about old-style extensions
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.680]  That just ran in the memory space of every app
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.280]  Or in the system space, you know, just system wise it was all it was all the same
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.720]  There was no system right there was just one pull of memory
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.320]  One giant memory region carved up into pieces where you supposed to stay in your little section, right?
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.280]  And it made me laugh because I remember thinking about that that like when I first started becoming a Mac nerd
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:51.760]  It was absolutely a point of pride to have as many of those as possible
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:58.040]  But there there was like a if you kept going and became more informed and a little bit more mature
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:00.880]  It started becoming at the highest levels
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:04.600]  It became more of a point of pride to have as few of those things as possible
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:10.280]  well the pride in having a lot of them wasn't so much that your machine was so tricked out but that you had figured out
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:12.240]  the correct load order and
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:17.080]  incompatibilities that you could actually run this many and they all worked because there was always like oh you got to load this first and
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.080]  This has to be there and these two are totally incompatible as you enable this one
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.520]  You have to disable these two but this one you can still keep as long as you move it after that
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.040]  Like it's what conflict catcher was made for like that
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:28.200]  Not only that you that you had all this software and stuff
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:31.020]  But you had figured out how to make it into a stable system and then yeah
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:37.120]  Eventually you stop you get sick of spending your time playing with conflict catcher and you're like do I really need Adobe type manager?
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:38.360]  Do I really really need it?
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:42.440]  How many fonts do I actually have and like, you know, something's got to go and Adobe type manager is big
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:44.480]  So ATM goes out the door, right?
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.160]  See, I always had to run it as I was doing I was doing design work
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:52.560]  But ATM was a good example where what was the character we had everybody?
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:59.720]  I mean it shipped from Adobe with like I think the tilde character in front like the extension. Yes tilt tilt the ATM
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:07.200]  Because on the old Mac OS tilde sorted alpha alphabetically first because it had to load first or was it last
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:09.800]  But yeah
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:14.700]  But that was that was the you know that and and putting funny characters in front of things in your Apple menu folder
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:18.340]  That'll be menu items sold there to make right make them stuff like that
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:23.100]  Yeah, but that was that was a very different world and like but that if you live through that
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:25.900]  you you understand like
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:29.300]  the whole thing with extensions is
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:37.500]  For iOS it makes sense like iOS is so button-down the whole time, right and we're all like we want ways to extend the system
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:42.020]  Like, you know keyboards or like having share panels include our stuff in it all these things
[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:45.060]  It's like come on. We need a way to do this so that it made a way to do it for iOS
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:50.020]  Right, but on the Mac even in an OS 10, we didn't have these memory patching extensions
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:50.580]  But we had you know
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:55.540]  we had all sorts of people have found ways to do things symbol extensions or the mock inject to get your code in there like
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:58.900]  It's not like the Mac needed extensions OS 10 has extensions
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:02.820]  And but the reason that Apple said we're gonna make this extension system for iOS
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:05.700]  It's gonna be safe and sandbox and all the you know things that we're doing
[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:10.280]  We're also gonna do it for the Mac because this is part of the unification of the platform
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:16.080]  Why should we not have them as a Mac and you can't these use can't be well the Mac's already got ways to extend it
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:20.080]  Yeah, it's a crappier way and it's kind of dangerous, but we don't need to bother with that
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:25.040]  Not many people why max anyway, the new Apple is if we have an awesome way to make extensions
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.680]  We're gonna deploy it everywhere
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:30.040]  The Mac's gonna get the iOS is gonna get it if there's a way to do it on the watch
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.000]  That's gonna get it too
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.080]  And that's that's a different philosophy and like if you live through the bad old days of these little rows of icons
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:42.880]  You understand deep in your bones. What is wrong with letting other people's software enter your memory space and screw with your applications
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:49.040]  And so any type of extension missing ism that avoids all those evils. Yes, please bring it to the Mac
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.280]  Not because we can't get you know extensions now
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:56.120]  Like we have all these weird extensions that can do weird things to your Mac even in OS 10. We just want better ones
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:01.360]  We don't we don't want we won't never want to be close to recreating that bad old world of those those rows of icons
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:08.600]  Yeah, we want the feature and it's it but we don't if you're technically informed at all. You don't want the the
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:16.280]  The buggy ramifications. Yeah, I backed off like I I used a lot more memory patching extensions the early days of OS 10
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:21.360]  A lot of it so, you know backfill functionality that wasn't in the OS itself and I've just slowly paired those things down
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:25.600]  Like I ran an application extent enhancer APE from the unsanitary guys
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:29.120]  I ran that for years and years, but then at a certain point it was like enough is enough
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.320]  I
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:33.160]  I'm only using it for one or two things. I can live without them
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:37.120]  like window-shaped was the last one to go cuz I really truly love that and I wish I could get it back now, but
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:43.760]  Clean hooks into the OS with real API is that don't involve invading the memory space of another process
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:51.000]  That's what we've always wanted the whole time and now Apple is finally providing that so I hope every every existing Apple mechanism
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  Is there still ones Apple supported ones of like, you know text input methods and also other things that actually will load
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.160]  You put something in a special folder you launch your application and the fret the cocoa frameworks will look in that folder for your thing
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:05.600]  And load it into the application and you're supposed to be well-behaved and not do anything nasty and you know
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.600]  but like not supposed to
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:12.600]  Implement something that changes what happens when you double click at the top of any window
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:15.840]  Yeah, but like once you're in there like that's why you know scripting additions
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:20.140]  We're like a gateway into the thing or the symbol extensions like that, you know
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:24.720]  We have all those things but some of them are officially out even like the menu bar icons
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:25.960]  and
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.560]  Someone was trying to correct me on this one
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:32.640]  I'm pretty sure someone can send any correction to you if I'm wrong about this that if you write a badly behaved menu bar
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:37.200]  You know icon type thing you can crash this crash system UI server because you're kind of in the mix there
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:38.520]  Maybe maybe that's not the case
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:40.680]  now if you use NS data bar instead of the
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:45.400]  Ns-status item instead of the the menu extras thing that's supposed to be undocumented
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:52.000]  But anyway, there's still lots of officially supported Apple things where you can get your code into someone else's memory space and all those mechanisms
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.760]  I would like them to make a officially supported, you know
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.920]  Separate process extension mechanism like all that, you know, the ones that are in Yosemite because I like all that functionality
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:07.080]  I'll like it even better if you can make it safer so that badly behaved extension can't crash my app. Yeah
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:14.360]  the the part of your review that I thought I was a little surprised that you spent as much space on it was
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:16.640]  Swift and
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:20.160]  After reading it it made all the sense in the world and I thought it was really really good
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:25.000]  I thought it was you know, but that's why I like your reviews is you're you're you always surprised me with something
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:29.720]  Because I didn't anticipate you writing that much about Swift because I didn't see Swift as a Yosemite feature
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:35.440]  I just saw it as something that coincidentally was a 2014 thing that Apple did and you know
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:41.720]  IOS 8 and Yosemite just happened to be the first new OS is that you know that you can write apps for with it
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:48.520]  That's like I was mentioning an ATP like I found myself at WWC sitting in metal sessions and taking notes
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:53.200]  Right, like what am I doing? This isn't this isn't an OS 10 technology metal is for iOS only
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:56.560]  Like why am I even bought but like it's because I was starting to view
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:00.520]  Everything that Apple did not as like oh, this is a Mac technology
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.380]  This is an iOS technology because like these are Apple's platform technologies and even though metal isn't on the Mac now
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:09.340]  There's no reason it couldn't be in the future. And even though Swift is not specific to OS 10
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:11.960]  It's just as applicable to OS 10 as it is to iOS, right?
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:17.040]  I mean the other reason of course I made such a big section out of this is two reasons one
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:22.740]  There's always something that I put in the review that I know almost nobody cares about but that I write a whole big like
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:27.040]  Disproportionate amount about it. Maybe not as much as Swift but like, you know, I wrote a whole section on launch D at one point
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.300]  Right. No one no one freaking cares about launch D except for me
[02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:34.840]  So, you know like that it was interesting to me and I was like I give myself that right?
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.480]  and the second thing is because I have a personal history with like the whole
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:42.160]  Clamoring for a new language and everything and I was gonna have my say and I was gonna do it in my OS 10 review
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.180]  And people could just deal with it
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:48.620]  I think your take is interesting and it's the reaction that people at large have had to Swift is
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.040]  curious to me
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:57.220]  Because I see an awful ever since WWC and continuing until now. I see an awful lot of criticism
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.560]  from developers of
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:07.480]  About Swift that to me just seems uncalled for like it's it's the first version
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.520]  They just came out with it. It's going to get better like all programming languages do
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:19.520]  like the thing is though is that they're showing it to us by Apple standards extraordinarily early and
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.940]  Letting us letting our here's what we're thinking, you know
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:30.800]  here's our idea for the next generation language for writing apps for our platforms in a very early stage and then they
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:37.460]  They've already incorporated a slew of feedback from the outside. It's it to me in a broad sense
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:42.240]  It's exactly what we've a lot of us have been hoping to see from Apple not just regarding developer tools
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.240]  but just Apple in general of
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:47.880]  Don't don't be and you've written about this on numerous times
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:53.320]  Like don't just take seven smart people and put them aside and let them work for five years and come out with the thing
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:58.880]  Because no matter how smart they are and how talented they are. They're gonna have their own personal idiosyncrasies
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:06.400]  Are gonna lead them to overlook certain things, you know that that they wouldn't if it was exposed to the world at large
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.840]  But now here, you know, they've they've finished it and they've given it to us and here it is
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.920]  All right, like if they had been working on Swift for another two years and then came out with it, but said this is it
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:21.520]  It's final. It wouldn't have incorporated all sorts of things that they're incorporating and
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:27.480]  But they're getting they're getting flack for it. Like the fact that it's changed so much just since WWDC
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:30.800]  Well, I think you've kind of made their argument for them in some respects
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:38.100]  there's two parts of this one is that a lot of things about Swift are not are fundamental to the philosophy embodied by the
[02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:42.400]  Language mostly having to do with like how how how method calls are bound
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:48.320]  Like what implementation happens when I call this method or basically method calls instead of message passing or whatever philosophically
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:54.360]  Late binding versus early binding and Swift is is wants to have everything statically figured out needs to know what code
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:57.400]  What code you know, you type something here. It looks like a function call
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:04.520]  What implementation does I actually run Swift wants to know a compile-time objective C its runtime was like oh, it's all dynamic dispatch
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:07.200]  I can figure out what it is. You can do method swizzling you can
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.120]  form method names out of strings and call them that
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.120]  Philosophical divide is not something that's going to be changed with a tweak to the language
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:19.560]  Even though Swift can use the object to see wrong time as you if you subclass all vanish object knows all this stuff
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:23.000]  Anyway, that philosophical divide dynamic versus static
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:30.740]  That's that's just an an honest difference between people who like that aspect of objective C and the people who design Swift who are saying
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:32.200]  That type of dynamic
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:38.800]  Aspect makes whole classes of optimization impossible for us because we can't see through the call boundary to understand how we can optimize across
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:42.800]  across that call because we don't even know what the hell it's going to call and so
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:44.760]  That's a philosophical difference
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:49.280]  No amount of tweaking is going to change that and the second thing is the idea that they're putting it out early and then doing doing
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:51.640]  These tweaks to like the minor details and stuff like that
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.520]  You know the complaint against that possibly by different people, you know
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:01.720]  Which is why Apple really can't win here because you're not gonna please everybody is that hey Swift is great and all
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:04.280]  But it would have been like they think that it was basically
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.640]  These guys went off and some smart guys came out with this thing
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:13.300]  We really would have loved it if you had built a major application with this language first and then presented it to us
[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:15.160]  Like if you had dog food did it?
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:16.640]  longer because if you had dog food
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.360]  Did it you would have found all the same exact things we're finding and like how many times have they tweaked how it interacts with?
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:25.860]  like core foundation and objective C API is like the various idioms of how
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:28.160]  Because they didn't write all new frameworks
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:31.800]  They need this language to work with their existing frameworks and it's not quite an exact match
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:34.600]  So they have to come up with conventions for like when you call one of these things
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:39.720]  we're gonna do this summer you're like all these different conventions of how to handle in out error parameters and
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:44.060]  Mapping between optionals which exists in Swift and like nil and you know
[02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:45.960]  Because there's no optionals like that in objective C
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:50.760]  And how do we how do we cross those boundaries if they had used Swift to write a major application?
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:56.500]  That in see this so the argument goes they would have figured a lot of stuff out on their own
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:59.540]  instead of bringing out bring it out to us so early it seems like
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:04.380]  This was kept really private to a small group of people and now you're throwing it on top of us and we're like
[02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:07.700]  Oh, it's not ready now. That's kind of self-contradictory. So what do you want?
[02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.180]  Do you want to see it early or do you want it to be done or you don't you want to have feedback?
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:13.660]  But you know different people want different things
[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:18.140]  It's not like a single person is trying to ask Apple to do things that are completely contradictory
[02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:20.860]  It's different groups of people want different things that have Apple. So
[02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:23.180]  Yeah, I mean I think about too
[02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:27.260]  I think it would object to see look like in 1989 or whatever and what object to see looks like now and like
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:31.540]  And the pace of development over deck to see has accelerated so much in the past few years
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:40.140]  That I'm willing to give Swift a lot of leeway to get things right but philosophically speaking if you have a disagreement like, you know
[02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:43.980]  The dynamic dispatch and everything like that that I don't see, you know
[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:48.180]  That's just gonna have to be in a disagreement because I don't think that's gonna change that much or you know
[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:53.140]  Because it's like the idea is like is it dynamic by default them? I could tie it down or is it static by default?
[02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:54.740]  and you can make it dynamic and
[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:59.940]  Swift is very much in the camp of static by default and you have the ability to make certain things dynamic and other people like
[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:03.900]  No, no, you've got the defaults wrong. It should be the other way, but it's they're coming from different places
[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:09.640]  Yeah, reading your your review and and what you had to say about Swift and I love it
[02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:11.300]  It it's to me
[02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:12.300]  It's it's you know
[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:15.340]  the right way to have about this like you even admit that there's
[02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:20.440]  Aspects of the language that you as a programmer aren't here liking you're not you don't like
[02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.540]  having you know the
[02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:26.420]  Static typing
[02:30:27.020 --> 02:30:28.820]  But you don't
[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:35.800]  You don't take that as therefore. It's bad. Right statically typed languages are bad. It is a perfect, you know, that's
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:41.620]  So much of the internet is is not being able to acknowledge. Okay, I disagree with that
[02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:46.740]  I dislike that but that I can acknowledge that that is a valid a
[02:30:47.500 --> 02:30:51.180]  Valid philosophy to have and especially since they stated their goals
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:54.900]  Like I said, this is the type of language we want to make and you can evaluate Swift
[02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:57.980]  And how well is it achieved their own stated goals?
[02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:00.820]  And then you can also like like I said a lot of the arguments against what it was
[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.340]  Like maybe you disagree with the goals then fine
[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:05.740]  Then what you could say is you should never have tried to make a language
[02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:08.340]  That is as convenient as a scripting language
[02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:12.740]  But you could write hoes in it because you you make a crappy is like a jack-of-all-trades master of none
[02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:15.600]  Like feel free to argue with the premises in the mission statement
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:20.380]  But that is a separate argument which you can have from if I accept this mission statement
[02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:23.820]  you know what how well does Swift fulfill that mission and
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.540]  What were the how did it do it?
[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:29.300]  Like that's the most interesting thing to me because I think the mission is incredibly ambitious
[02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.060]  Like I said, it's a totally an Apple move
[02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:37.380]  Like it is very gutsy and very ambitious and not because it's not doing whatever one seemingly who's complaining about one
[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:40.740]  To do is like just make me a better nicer objective C. That's all I want
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:44.500]  Don't try to make some crazy language that you think you can use for everything like that
[02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:46.700]  You could you know because if you look at the software stack
[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:51.940]  like you have things that are written in C and even in C++ and then you have things that are written in Objective C and
[02:31:51.940 --> 02:31:53.500]  Why are these three languages there?
[02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:54.420]  It's like well
[02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:58.220]  But they're really low-level stuff like the kernel and like it may be even like, you know
[02:31:58.220 --> 02:32:03.280]  Core foundation and like then you have to use C and C++ for those things but then for like the higher level frameworks
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:07.340]  Those are an Objective C and Swift is saying why can't we have one language that spans that whole range?
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:10.020]  Why do we have one language and maybe we're not gonna write the kernel in it just yet
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:14.220]  But we could if we really wanted to because we wouldn't certainly wouldn't have to worry about a performance hit
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:17.420]  Right because it can be as fast as those low-level languages
[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:18.780]  But it can go all the way up to hey
[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:21.460]  You just want to type a bunch of stuff and you know, you want to do, you know
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:25.460]  You know hash bang user bin Swift and just start typing
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:28.980]  Yeah, and you want to create you want to create a string just by typing
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:36.560]  You know quotation mark. Here's the string another quotation. We're like and all the things we love about JavaScript
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:42.220]  or Perl or Ruby or Python and make one language that spans that whole range because and it's an ambitious goal and it would be
[02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:44.240]  Great for Apple if they can pull it off because then it's like hey
[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:48.460]  finally, we don't have to hire C developers C++ to objective C developers and
[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:52.680]  Maintain a compiler that can compile all three of those languages have different standards
[02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:52.860]  Yes
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:58.880]  C99 C++ 11 and whatever the hell we're doing to objective C if we just make one language that we control everything about the
[02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:01.480]  It's our thing that spans the entire range of our things boy
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:05.080]  Wouldn't that be amazing? Yeah, and maybe they're biting off more than they can chew
[02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:09.720]  But I admire the ambition and my question is how the hell you gonna do that? And so I wanted to delve into
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:15.560]  How do you make a language? It's easy to make the parts that you type like you can just say blah blah blah our language
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:16.700]  Looks like this. Here's the keywords
[02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:20.340]  Here's the syntax and then we'll just write a compiler that makes turns that into code that runs
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:24.640]  It's like that's the hard part. You know, how do you how do you get from something that looks like?
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:28.540]  JavaScript or Perl or Ruby or Python but is as fast as C and
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:33.540]  that's what I spent the entire second of this room delving into because I think it's interesting and
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:37.240]  Definitely a change of pace from the way Apple has done
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:40.820]  It's you know compiler software in the past and certainly a change of pace from the way
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:46.260]  JavaScript runtimes are implemented or Java runtimes or certainly Ruby Python Perl that stuff
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:52.540]  yeah, it's it's evident and it's funny because you know, so many Apple employees are just
[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:55.820]  Never in public and never named
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:00.420]  And you know who knows how influential they are inside the company
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:06.180]  But you know because Chris Latner started the LLVM project outside Apple, you know
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:09.280]  And then they more or less it's weird because it wasn't a company
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.980]  It was an open-source project, but they effectively aqua hired him when they bought it
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:17.340]  You know effectively bought the open-source project
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:22.420]  When they brought him in board, but he's you know, that's clearly to be you know
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:23.100]  It's very obvious
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:29.060]  Like you said that that there have been in the rate of change of objective C improvements over the last few years has been impressive
[02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:32.180]  Well, it coincides with the LLVM era
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:37.220]  Maybe they got the compote they took control of the compiler brother
[02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:41.500]  You know what they should own and control the key technologies for that platform. The compiler is one of those technologies
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:42.860]  Why are we using GCC?
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:47.540]  It's hampering our ability to extend the language is hampering our ability to optimize is hampering our ability to make our IDE
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:50.140]  They have this multi multi-year transition
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:57.260]  Slowly slowly getting away from DCC to be completely on an LLVM based compiler and then like they're off to the race, right?
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:02.140]  And it's like you said you have to look back to what are the goals of the project GCC is a fantastic
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:11.020]  Project it is one of the most successful computer science projects in history, but its stated goal is to be a universal
[02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:12.460]  compiler
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:17.900]  for any and all platforms and the fact that it succeeded at that is why it was there for
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:25.660]  Next to use when they started bolting on objective C features to see back in the 80s
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:30.040]  It's the fact that GCC was there and aimed to be universal
[02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:36.980]  Was the reason that they could get it to work but then the fact that it's universal and it's you know is this
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:41.620]  Apparently convolute, you know, really really impenetrable code code base
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:49.660]  Eventually just really hampered their ability to move the language forward and it was also old like it's an old code base
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:53.140]  And and then anything you did it's kind of like doing anything with w3c, you know
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:58.040]  All the even worse actually anything you did like it kind of has to be your needs aren't the only needs here
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.900]  There are other stakeholders and you kind of have to get agreement from all parties involved that this is the thing that you want to
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:04.220]  Do because there's just one code base
[02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:06.980]  Whereas Apple doesn't need anyone's okay to do whatever the hell they want with their
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:13.700]  Compiler and it's not quite like that. There's clang and that stuff. That's a C++ compiler. Those are open source
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:19.140]  there are other people that are using them Apple can't just do whatever the hell they want with that type of thing because then they
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:21.660]  Don't end up with a fork because other people are like, well, I don't want apples clang
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:25.540]  So they're sensitive that there but thus far Swift is not open source and not open
[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:27.540]  That's another issue people have with the language
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:31.620]  It's entirely theirs. I don't know if that will change in the future
[02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:34.180]  I know there are people inside Apple who want it to be open source
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:39.360]  But there are you know, that is not high on their priority list. Apparently like right now. They're just you know, yeah
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:39.700]  Yeah
[02:36:39.700 --> 02:36:42.260]  I always say it out the door get get Yosemite out the door
[02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:46.300]  Get the language in shipshape and then revisit this issue in the future
[02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:53.460]  I don't think they're do anything like that until it settles down until you know Swift of this year is
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:56.180]  Nearly identical to Swift of last year
[02:36:56.180 --> 02:37:01.780]  Let's see. I don't think they need like that that is I can understand that the desire to do that
[02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:05.540]  Like with the motivation like what makes you feel like let's just you know, let's just table this until we get our
[02:37:06.060 --> 02:37:10.100]  Stuff together right but but compared to WebKit though WebKit
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:13.540]  Was like, you know open because it came from cage to email
[02:37:13.540 --> 02:37:15.700]  It was always open and did it did it in pay like well
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:18.480]  We don't want to make we don't want to show WebKit to the world until it sells now
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.920]  They show WebKit to the world soon as they announce Safari and it was
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:25.780]  Definitely shaky and weird and it doesn't seem to have hurt WebKit development. So like I think it can be done
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:31.660]  it's just a question of it's like it's a question of priorities and like there Apple has never been the greatest open-source citizen in terms
[02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:35.220]  Of like you have complete access to our repository. You can see our changes in real time
[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:36.940]  They just do dumps like they do their work
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:42.220]  it's hidden away and then they release the product based on it and then there's an open source dump and that is
[02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:49.020]  Not really the way that everyone wants open source to work, but it's it's sure better than never giving the code at all
[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:54.820]  yeah, the gist of it is that the more I learn about Swift and you know get past the
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:38:00.340]  Intro, you know chapter one of the Swift programming book just you know, hello world type programs
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:04.780]  It's it's evident that it is exactly what you would think it is
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:09.720]  It's a language designed by a compiler guy, which is interesting
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:16.020]  Right a compiler guy who likes C++ a little bit. Yeah, that's it clearly comes through a little bit
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:22.220]  I mean LLVM is written in C++ and LMS, you know, like it's obviously everyone who uses C
[02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:26.320]  But anyone anyone who uses any language for a long period of time?
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.880]  Comes to hate that language, but also kind of like it
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:34.500]  I mean like the longer longer you use it the more you're just like the part that you hate just great on you
[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:38.440]  But you also kind of like it so it's like Swift has a lot of the things in it
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:41.580]  You're like this person clearly hates a lot of features about C++
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:44.620]  But also kind of think some of them are kind of okay and just like just like boy
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:49.160]  I wish they had been done differently. Yeah, but it's it's it's it's so obvious
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:52.420]  and I think the details you delve into make a lot of these things clear where it's
[02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:55.260]  It's never
[02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:59.180]  Academically precocious. It's not this is clever this you know
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:04.780]  Which is like when when you and I were younger a lot of the new languages were like Dylan or small talk or lisp
[02:39:04.820 --> 02:39:08.860]  Yeah, exactly that like mathematically pure Haskell these days, right?
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:11.900]  Well lisp predates us but lisp is from the 50s, but they're you know
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:19.060]  The that that that whole derivative that whole realm of language is Dylan's a perfect example because it was I think it came up
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:24.220]  in the 90s, but you know, it was academically interesting, but it yeah, like it was like a
[02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:29.520]  Purist viewpoint on something. Yeah, like how would how would you make Mac toolbox calls from Dylan?
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:29.780]  All right
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:33.120]  whereas Swift is like the whole purpose of this language is like
[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:36.120]  You have we have to be able to call into the both
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:40.060]  You know, we have to call into the C C++ and objective C frameworks that already exist
[02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:44.660]  Alright, so, you know and we have to be able to work with like NS object in the objective C runtime
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:47.940]  And by the way, we also even though it's a memory safe thing by default
[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:51.200]  we also have to wait to do it on safe pointers because sometimes we need to do that like
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:57.620]  totally pragmatic because it can't can't afford to do anything else like it's a mission statement is to be this language that spans this huge
[02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:01.860]  Range and it spans this huge range because guess what Apple has a bunch of
[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:07.500]  existing code in that huge range and if you want to interface with it or someday replace it you have to span the same range
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:13.720]  And they get to use three languages and you get our four languages or depending how you count like, you know C++ C
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:20.560]  Objective C and then like shell scripting or Python or even Apple script or whatever you want to try to span that whole range
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.720]  You're gonna have to be pragmatic about what you're willing to do to your beautiful language
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:31.200]  And it's you know, a lot of the languages that are popular were not designed by compiler guys
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.080]  Larry Wall was not a compiler guy
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:38.460]  I mean, it's you know, it was he was it was the replacement for like a bunch of shell scripts and you know
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:40.760]  TR and said and awk and
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:44.960]  And you know is I would just he more or less it was here's the syntax
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:49.160]  I'd like to be able to write to do these things and then he made a thing that did them and I think
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.480]  you know
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:56.000]  And like you said on ATP then a lot of sin for decades after there's been a lot of work of well
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.560]  How do we make this crazy language fast?
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:00.560]  Well, not so much for pearl but like JavaScript was a very sample ago
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:03.740]  This syntax looks kind of like Java. It's not really and by the way
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.080]  We'll make some way to run it, right?
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:10.420]  And it was no consideration to how to make it fast and then the result was an interesting language
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:15.000]  that was pretty approachable for most people who can program and it was dreadfully slow and
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.560]  it's been you said millions of dollars and
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:24.160]  Like three four five major generations of how are we actually going to run JavaScript?
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:31.360]  You know to get to where we are today where it runs at a reasonable speed whereas Swift, you know being written by a compiler guy
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:33.720]  Maybe the preeminent compiler guy in the world today
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:38.440]  Has it just reeks from top to bottom of this is going to be fast
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:43.120]  Yeah, see was written by compiler guys to like languages that look like, you know, right
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:45.200]  You know the portable assembly like where you can see where it maps
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:50.160]  It's not that rare for language to be written by a compiler guy, but it's rare for a high-level language, right?
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:51.120]  Well, that's exactly it
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.680]  That's exactly it where it in fact see looks like it's written by a compiler guy because it looks that it looks like compiler
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.560]  You know input it looks like like an intermediary format
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  Yeah, you could you can squint at it and see the assembly code the correct response especially with like CISC CPUs back in the day
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:14.360]  Yeah, and especially if you look at older C code, you know from the 70s and 80s before some of the you know
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.920]  Slightly higher level features that got added and you know later versions
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:21.640]  Right, it's it's on its sleeve
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.560]  It's it's a you know
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:25.560]  This is made to be easy to compile
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:28.640]  You should you should read you probably didn't because it's really goes too long
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.480]  But one of the thing one of the many many many things I linked in the review was a link to that
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:37.600]  Awesome webkit blog post about the fourth fourth tier LVM
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:45.040]  Optimizer for JavaScript try actually reading that whole article because they like they take you through it
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:49.540]  It's really really well-written and they lead you through it a piece at a time and you'll probably get like 50%
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.760]  60% through it and realize they haven't even gotten to the part that tells you the new thing they did everything they've just described
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.360]  So far that is blowing your mind is existing JavaScript optimization features. They haven't even gotten to the fourth tier part
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.000]  Like the the hoops they jump through to make JavaScript fast
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:09.160]  Just make your head spin like every one of them seems so incredibly dangerous that it would be
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:15.320]  Inadvisable to try and seems impossible that could ever be made to work and yet that's we're all running in our web browsers, right?
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:18.600]  And it's you know on every platform
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.840]  Every day every you know and probably I mean, I don't see any way out of it
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:28.360]  Where for the rest of our life JavaScript is gonna be a part of it for the rest of our life
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:31.840]  I'm gonna plan a living for a long time, but you got to get cool with Dart and everything
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:36.840]  Like people take runs at it from time to time if anybody ever gets like it's like, you know Bitcoin
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.840]  if everyone ever gets hundred more than 50% of the compute power if anyone ever gets like
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:46.480]  Dominant market share and web browsers again, which doesn't look like it's gonna happen. But hey, who knows they could replace it
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:52.320]  They you know, someone could seize the moment and be like like Google's trying we tried with Dart like we have a popular browser
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:57.120]  How about everyone write Dart and we can pre-compile it and it's like JavaScript but able to be and everyone's like no
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.480]  Sorry, you don't have that kind of you don't have that kind of pull
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:00.920]  We're just gonna keep writing JavaScript
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:06.600]  but I don't put it out of it like even like when I when I look at Swift I made a few sly illusions in the
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:08.600]  thing of like oh
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:11.800]  There's no reason that Apple couldn't say
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:18.060]  Oh, and by the way, you can just like you can write Dart and they'll run, you know, Google Chrome wherever you can put Swift
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:24.780]  code and and if you load your in your web pages instead of JavaScript and when we load them we will
[02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:30.300]  compile that Swift code and keep the compiled version it'll be much faster than JavaScript because it's on that level of like
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:34.500]  It's not that much worse to use than JavaScript in the libraries are not up to snuff or whatever
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:41.700]  But or even just server-side web programming like the places where a Swift can draw is not not constrained in the same way as as
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:46.980]  Objective C or any of other apples other languages. So if Apple ever wanted to make that move and say
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:51.820]  You know, you can use JavaScript as your scripting language to your web page or you can use
[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:57.540]  Swift to do it like if you were gonna make like an iOS only web app where you knew the target platform could do that
[02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:02.100]  Right with the built-in library that's in the in the browser, you know with a bunch of niceties
[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.900]  yeah, and the compiler gets fast enough in the language like
[02:45:05.980 --> 02:45:11.620]  There are many things that are possible when this very new baby Swift starts getting mature
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:16.720]  like it if they succeed in their goal to make a language that spans this range and that is able to be fast and everything is
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.220]  All sorts of places with can go like even just down to like the stupid shell scripts and Perl scripts
[02:45:21.220 --> 02:45:25.160]  They have that are buried inside the installer packages. Yeah install software on OS 10. Yeah
[02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:28.740]  if if Swift had a file IO library that was
[02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:35.460]  Worth a damn instead of having to use cocoa for stuff like the language doesn't preclude that they could they could make change all those
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:39.100]  Scripts like you could really make one big unified language or it could turn out the ten years from now
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:42.820]  We turn out it was folly to try to span that lane range with one language and didn't work out
[02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:47.240]  But well and it makes me it's funny too and it makes me think it's one of those things where it was like
[02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:50.780]  You know inside Apple a lot of people don't know what was good
[02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:52.900]  I mean no almost nobody knew that Swift was going on
[02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:58.580]  Everybody I talked to at Apple was surprised by Swift's announcement as we were that's not working for Apple is exciting
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:01.960]  You're like what the what? Yeah, but it's to me
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:05.380]  it's an unfortunate coincidence that it also happened to be the year that the
[02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:12.940]  Automation group added JavaScript support as a alternative to Apple script everywhere. You could write Apple script now
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:13.900]  You can write JavaScript
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:19.380]  It seems to me like a better idea might have been to hold off on that and wait until you can do it in Swift
[02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:25.460]  Did you see the tweet someone had like with it with the JavaScript automation of the OSA script thing?
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:31.940]  You can use the JavaScript automation to call into an objective C library that loads Ruby and then you run Ruby code
[02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:37.580]  It was like four languages in one command line like showing like all the things there's all these weird bridges
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:41.740]  You know because you can from from Apple from JavaScript JavaScript automation
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:44.540]  You can load objective C libraries and from some objective C libraries
[02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:47.060]  You can load the Ruby things I guess from the Ruby cocoa thing or whatever
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:52.740]  Yeah, it is quite and then just a Swift into that mix too. They can interoperate with objective C as well. Yeah
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:58.940]  I'll sort itself out. I guess I guess so, but it seems to me like the future of I mean
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:02.100]  I'm always happy when the automation stuff has any new features and
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:06.660]  because I'm always afraid that they're gonna turn the lights out on on sales group, but
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:14.020]  So it's it's called the ugaries. What's that? They got libraries last year. Yeah. No, they've been it. No, I don't
[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:19.700]  Got JavaScript. Oh, right. I I only say that because I just know that at a high level Apple's interest isn't there
[02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:22.220]  I'm not saying that you're after you know, the last couple of years haven't been good
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:25.200]  I think the last couple years have been great like script libraries have been great
[02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:29.180]  There've been you know, and I think adding JavaScript as a supported language is great
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:31.680]  I just can't help but think though that in the long run
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:40.060]  There will be more scripts written in automation scripts written in Swift than Apple script or JavaScript
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:43.020]  For all those things and the reason you can have all these different languages
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:45.960]  The problem is not the language except maybe Java Apple script
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.300]  Which is a gross language to people who want like a regular programming language
[02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:53.540]  Well, and the problem is the problem is the API's you're talking to like that's the hard part, right?
[02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:58.500]  It's like you got to figure out what is that? What is this dictionary support? How do I can I do what I need to do?
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:03.300]  Can I address this window in a way that is reliable? Can I get it the the element in this window?
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:08.180]  Can it like it's all down to how scriptable the application is and the language is just like a minor
[02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:14.060]  implementation detail at that point most of the time you're fighting with the the scripting dictionaries of the apps that will even let you do
[02:48:14.060 --> 02:48:16.980]  What you want to do and what kind of weird hoops do you have to jump through?
[02:48:16.980 --> 02:48:20.300]  Well, I'm just thinking though that if they if they can eventually get it to be Swift
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:24.140]  it would be easier to call into like if you wanted to put like a
[02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:28.520]  Nib or a zib, however, you pronounce how you pronounce the xib version
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:34.340]  Yeah, zip sounds good a zip file with your script that it's you know, it would be a lot more, you know, just like
[02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:40.460]  It since coco already uses it. It would be easier to call it from the scripting side too if it was the same language
[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:44.360]  Yeah, but then you're kind of doing actual real application development like you're not right
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.820]  You're not gonna be able to call it. You still have to send Apple events, right? I I guess so
[02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:50.060]  I don't know. I mean you do now. I don't know
[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:52.820]  It's not like they're gonna let you call natively into the you know
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:59.300]  Like I don't know the automation story has always been a little bit weird. I think it's been making progress in recent years
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:01.500]  So I'm kind of optimistic about it
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:06.920]  I like the idea that like when they renamed Apple script editor or script editor and now actually when you launch it
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:10.780]  You can pick which language you want to be your default and each window has a little pop-up menu
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:12.020]  That says it's a script editor
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:17.020]  Do you want to write Apple script or JavaScript or a Swift script not quite yet?
[02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:21.140]  But like it's poised to you know, I say it was always supposed to be multi-language
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:28.260]  But for the longest time it was like multi-language in theory and now it's finally multi-language and actuality again. So yeah, finally
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.260]  It
[02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:34.780]  Is finally it's a that's an actual non-ironic non-ironic finally
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:40.500]  Yeah, there's probably I can try to think of what other languages that people have been using like people won't use frontier anymore
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:42.220]  No, but that was one of them
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:50.600]  Well, and there was JavaScript Mark Aldrich of late-night software the guy behind script debugger and and he had faceband for a while
[02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:55.540]  He had a JavaScript OSA that was built. I'm gonna say Mozilla's
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:57.540]  JavaScript engine
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:03.220]  That did worked but it never really took off and it because I think it's the sort of thing where it had to come from
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:05.220]  Apple to really take off and
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:11.700]  There were certain weirdnesses that that using JavaScript instead of Apple script you ended up with
[02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:18.320]  Tangled syntax that was like what and it would take Apple to fix it because I kind of had to you know
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.820]  It had to be fixed at the OSA level not at the language level
[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:25.620]  Yeah, that's always been a little bit weird. I mean, it's like they're just the language is just so different
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:28.740]  How can you how can you call the same things and it's always just you know
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:31.540]  Especially when you're calling it other libraries again because like, you know
[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:36.100]  JavaScript can import the objective C stuff and then you're making objective C calls with named parameters
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:40.020]  But JavaScript doesn't have named parameters. You got all these mangled things. It's just like the the Python
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:43.860]  Cocoa bridges they've had and everything all those cross-language things are weird
[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:48.100]  But OSA is always gonna be cross-language because I always say that's the whole point of it. It's open scripting architecture
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:53.380]  It always comes back to Apple script
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:58.020]  Anyway, we've we've gone on long enough. I think it's been a good show. I
[02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:03.360]  Love your review and ATP is my favorite show
[02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:09.220]  Thank you really is and it's all because of you. I always know he's gonna make up for that at a coven post
[02:51:09.220 --> 02:51:11.180]  Well, here's the thing. I I like Casey
[02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:15.820]  I like Marco but one of the things that's interesting about the ATP is that you guys often disagree
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:19.300]  maybe even usually one of the three of you is gonna disagree and
[02:51:19.540 --> 02:51:23.500]  Whenever there's an argument and I'm listening and I know everybody out there people often tell me this
[02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:29.140]  It's like everybody listens to podcasts knows this feeling where like somebody will say something and you want to jump in and you know
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:32.220]  Either correct something they said was wrong or point out
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:39.120]  the logical conclusion of where this is going and I the thing that makes ATP my favorite show is that you're always there to
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:44.500]  Do it and it's so satisfying like I'll think oh I gotta I gotta write to these guys and tell them that reminds me of
[02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:48.780]  Something and as soon as you have a chump chance to jump in nine times out of ten
[02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:53.660]  You say exactly what it is that I was hoping somebody would say, you know, but it cuts both ways
[02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:55.580]  I'm just complaining one of the after shows recently
[02:51:55.580 --> 02:51:57.220]  I think I tweeted you about it
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:02.180]  Like when you're talking about the 16 gigs of flash which we didn't get to talk about in the eye in the iOS devices
[02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:08.780]  I know that how this terrible like we recorded an ATP and I called that move like a punitive mood on Apple's part
[02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:14.860]  And and then you before we could post our show you either posted a blog post about it where you called it punitive or?
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:19.900]  Released a podcast about it where you called the punitive and it's like god damn it like it's very we both
[02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:24.320]  Same thing but yours got out first. But yeah, I know I know the feel like again
[02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:27.260]  Wait when I hear you on podcasts
[02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:31.940]  I think the same thing like we we tend to think and say the same things and then it's like
[02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:34.700]  Half of the time you're excited to hear the other person
[02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:39.140]  Chime in with what you would have said if you're there and the other half the time you're like, I was just thinking that
[02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.100]  Good credit for that idea. We
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:46.100]  Shouldn't go on long about it, but we could talk about the 16 gig thing quickly
[02:52:46.100 --> 02:52:51.220]  But I I think if you want to stop dancing around the the the elephant in the room
[02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:55.740]  I think the bottom line is and I think you guys even mentioned this what it all comes down to is it is a
[02:52:56.100 --> 02:53:01.740]  Fear in the back of our heads that this is a Tim Cook thing because it really only makes sense
[02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:05.340]  I think it makes perfect sense. It's if you're staring at a spreadsheet of
[02:53:05.980 --> 02:53:07.980]  component costs and
[02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:12.260]  Profit margins and the combined net with a
[02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:15.540]  projection of how a
[02:53:17.060 --> 02:53:22.420]  1664 128 spread would push X number of people to get 64
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:29.820]  Instead of the lower price model than in a 32 64 128 scenario it from a spreadsheet
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:34.860]  Perspective it makes perfect sense. I completely understand every aspect of it
[02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:38.040]  But in every other way it is to me
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.580]  It's it's a boneheaded mistake
[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:44.980]  But Tim Cook's the same guy going all on all the talk shows and TV stations and talking about how Apple doesn't do
[02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:49.700]  Moves that are short-term is not looking for a short-term stock market game. It's long-term thinking or whatever
[02:53:49.700 --> 02:53:54.380]  So he's saying all the right things but like sometimes people just make mistakes and like I said when we were talking about this
[02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:59.620]  This decision to go with the 16 64 128 like this decision was made a long time ago
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:05.140]  And I think by now when they're having the meetings about like iOS 8 adoption and storage space and stuff like that
[02:54:05.140 --> 02:54:08.620]  Like hopefully they're gonna correct for it. Like they're not perfect. They make mistakes
[02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:14.240]  I think they may be just miscalculated like they were they were dazzled by all the things that you mentioned like
[02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:19.340]  look at how we can push people to the product line and it's and like and in exchange like do we think there are any
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:26.440]  Downsides to the 16 and they were able to convince themselves that the downsides weren't that big of a deal but like that
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:32.960]  At still selling 16 and still selling the a5 with no way for developers to exclude it. I think the meetings they're having now
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:38.560]  Hopefully they're discussing these things and saying going forward for the next set of things. Let's not make this particular mistake again
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.520]  Let's let's remedy this like there's a big lag time in this type of thing
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:47.320]  You know again when when they came out with the that same range and when they came out the iPads and it was the same range
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:51.080]  It's not like they can learn that lesson between like no when they I felt like it's just you know
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:53.360]  There is a long turnaround time this and I'm hoping that
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:58.840]  That it's this is not like, you know a like them being duplicitous about the philosophy
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:01.160]  But it merely a mistake that they will correct going forward
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:04.680]  I hope so because my fear is if they don't go to 32 next year
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:08.280]  Then they're already going to be too late with 32 and when they do go to 32
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:10.520]  It's already going to be 32 is too little
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:11.040]  Yeah
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.600]  And the thing is it it's on them to get this right because they're they're the company that does not add an SD card slot
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:18.600]  To their you know, iOS devices, right?
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:22.680]  So they really and you can't upgrade it and so like they really need they really need to get this, right?
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:26.240]  And they're doing things like making cameras that shoot
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:27.400]  Yeah
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:33.680]  1080p video like really credible 1080p video like really good like you're not gonna regret that
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:37.840]  You know, this is this is your your footage of your you know
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:45.000]  Sun's first birthday, you know and time-lapse and burst mode like there's so many ways you can fill up that storage really and the panor
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:51.640]  41 megapixel panoramic images. Yeah, which is great, but which are huge. Yeah, it's like count
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:53.520]  It's just yeah
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:58.960]  It's the I don't remember if this was the most recent episode of the one before but it's it's like the and you mentioned it
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:02.160]  When you were talking about how like this is the type of device where you have to give caveats
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:06.480]  We tell people to buy it. Yeah, it's like all of us told people who wanted to buy max back when max
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:10.680]  We're first becoming popular. We just always tell them back in the day. Like you can go get a power book
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:15.560]  They're really awesome. But make sure you upgrade the RAM. They say really do I need up game like trust me by default
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:17.320]  It comes to an amount of RAM that is ridiculous
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:17.560]  No
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:21.240]  and and we also used to tell them to get third-party RAM because Apple used to charge you a ton for it like
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:27.560]  Those stupid caveats they used to tell how many years did we spend telling people upgrade the RAM don't buy apples ran by third party
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:32.080]  It added a complication and a caveat to a recommendation that made it scarier for people
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:37.640]  Yeah, and now that that type of thing is creeping back in we're like don't don't buy the 16th
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:38.580]  You're gonna regret it
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:42.140]  If you're asking me advice on which one you should buy you're the type of person who should not buy the 16
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:49.240]  Trust me save money for a couple more months and get the you know, 64. Yeah, I just can't I don't know
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:55.600]  It just irks me that there's and it doesn't bother me quite as much that like the lower-end models that the old I you know
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:57.600]  I've had minis are
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:04.080]  16 but it really irks me that the new top-of-the-line one starts at 16. Yeah, like there's no this
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:09.620]  There's an unsafe model to buy in the flagship iPhone 6 right like people who are only going to spend
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:16.560]  $299 on their iPad are kind of I'm sure going into it with eyes wide open that they know they're not getting the best and
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:22.280]  That they're you know that there's gonna be some limit. Whereas anybody buying a new iPad air, too
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:24.360]  I
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.360]  Think that they should feel confident that no matter which one they get that it's it's a good it's you know
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:32.580]  Good better best not and and RAM is the same thing
[02:57:32.580 --> 02:57:34.600]  Like when they used to sell Mac models with two little RAM
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:39.460]  It's like you're only hurting your own image app because there was nothing worse than a Mac with a spinning disk and too little RAM
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:40.080]  Yeah
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:45.920]  And it just didn't get better memory compression was the perhaps the only bump that actually made like the brand usage you get better
[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:51.280]  Right, but every other thing like three OS versions from now that RAM is gonna be even worse
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:54.880]  At least you could upgrade the RAM until they started soldering it on and once they did start soldering around
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:59.000]  I was glad that they bumped everybody up to 16 minimum and everything like they're finally getting on the ball on that
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:00.480]  But now they're just dropped the ball
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:05.900]  Yeah, and it's it's like I've been writing that it's it's like a brand thing and it's you can't measure that on a spreadsheet
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:10.920]  But the RAM thing with max like and I know an ATP you said like four four megabytes of RAM
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:17.120]  Which shows how old the problem I remember when four four megabytes of RAM was the baseline and it was years past where?
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:19.840]  Everybody else in the industry had gone to like 16
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:29.720]  But I think even to this day all the way from the era when when they were selling max with only four megabytes
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:32.120]  megabytes of RAM to today
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:38.680]  that helped fuel the image that so many people have that Apple price gouges people because
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:45.000]  that everybody was told you have to upgrade the RAM and don't buy it from app don't buy from Apple go to crucial or
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:50.720]  You know somebody like that and then get someone to install it or all and sort for you and feel like you're breaking your brand
[02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:55.480]  New machine because you'd have to do this thing that made a snap, you know, yeah, it never felt good
[02:58:57.840 --> 02:59:03.080]  But when you know and you go and you'd say like go to crucial crucial has great RAM and you google some reviews and
[02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:05.600]  Everybody would say yeah crucial sells high quality RAM
[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:09.100]  This is this is good. These are good memory chips and then you see that you were saving
[02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:12.880]  $600 versus what Apple would charge you for the same amount of RAM and
[02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:20.000]  It's actually it was actually true that Apple was price gouging you because you know that Apple gets better prices on the RAM than you
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  Do or that crucial does?
[02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:26.600]  And then they would they would be kind of jerks about it where like they wouldn't service your machine
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:29.560]  If it had third-party RAM in it and all sorts of crap like that. Remember those days
[02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:29.760]  Yeah
[02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:30.000]  Yeah
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:35.480]  You take it in and they would you would have to you yourself would have to take out your third-party RAM and hide hide it
[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:37.960]  from them right keep it in your desk in an
[02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:43.000]  Antistatic sleeve or something like that and I get and if you replaced all of the RAM
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:47.320]  I guess you'd have to like go and find your old Apple chips that you replaced and put them back in
[02:59:47.800 --> 02:59:52.560]  Yeah, and yeah, this is not this is not a good product experience. It shouldn't be like that and like they
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:58.560]  Anything like that that just you never want to sell somebody something that you know three years from now
[02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:00.560]  They're gonna hate you for buying, right?
[03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:07.120]  You should not sell the base model accord should not have trouble accelerating up a hill, you know
[03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:11.320]  It may not go anywhere near as fast as the tricked-out high-end model
[03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:15.080]  But it's still you shouldn't have trouble with common things like driving up a hill
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:19.960]  Yeah, it's just some some baseline level and you don't want to skimp and things like that
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:23.960]  Especially the weird and esoteric and that you know as someone who knows the technology
[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:28.120]  Again, especially with spinning this can have such a dramatic effect on performance
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:30.760]  There was nothing worse than early versions of OS X swapping
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:36.040]  I think it was just nothing it would just it would your performance would go off a giant cliff and there was nothing you could
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:40.000]  Do about it and even if you told people like we'll just run one application at a time or quit more apps
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.160]  It was just like this is not the way it should work
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:45.120]  And obviously you can't give all the RAM of the world every machine
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:51.080]  But the rest of the industry would slowly march up the minimum and Apple would stubbornly stay at whatever number they decided
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:55.220]  Was the correct number for just years past when they should yeah
[03:00:55.220 --> 03:01:01.360]  And it's it's less excusable now than ever because you know that they're getting the economies of scale and that they can get the best
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:04.040]  Prices they're using they're using the same components
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:07.800]  Not like they have to get special RAM for their special power PC chips or anything, you know, right?
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.400]  I it's it's you know
[03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:14.360]  And like you even mentioned it on ATP that there was a story that Apple's consuming like 50% of the world's
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:20.360]  SSD storage or 25% of the NAND or whatever it was whatever it is, but it's it
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:23.560]  I'm sure that's true and it's impressive but it doesn't you know
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:28.080]  It they're not just buying it in an open market. It's not like they're going they are
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:31.360]  They are a huge input into that market. They they influence the market
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.560]  they're planning ahead of time for like they'll you know,
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:38.880]  here's a few billion dollars build a factory because we're gonna ask you to buy the stuff for us and you'll slowly pay off what
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.920]  We loan you for the fact like that's that's the way they do all their stuff, right?
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:46.800]  So if they wanted to tell people a year ago, hey, we want to buy X million 32 gigabyte
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:53.520]  Chips because that's what they were gonna put in the iPad air too. They could have had it every every 16
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:58.200]  Every 16 gigabyte chip that they have could be a 32 gigabyte one if they had wanted it to be
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:01:59.560]  Yeah, or maybe like two years ago
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:02.160]  He's gonna lead time to like, you know tooling in fact
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:06.640]  We're like but Apple again that type of thing Apple is in the position to do that and they do it all the time
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:08.240]  They will they will pay
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:13.760]  For the people to build the capacity that they're going to use to build their products and get the money back until he's fine
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:17.560]  They probably did it with a Taiwan semiconductor to do the the a8
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:21.640]  I'm sure Apple was paying billions and millions of dollars to make that happen
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:26.080]  Yeah, I think that a lot of these decisions are made two years in advance
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:31.080]  But I think if they wanted to go 16 to 32 baseline, that's the type of change
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:34.240]  They could make a little bit because it's not that not that far
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:39.320]  You just look at the Android phones, right a lot of Android phones sell a lot of them sell with you know
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:43.480]  This much flash and I'm like again, you know, I discounted the SD card slots and everything like that
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:46.760]  It's not so far outside the realm that if anything would be outside the realm
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:51.640]  It would be like these crazy super retina iMac displays that are probably in short supply in that one
[03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:54.240]  You really can't say look, you know, no matter how much you pay
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:55.480]  We're just barely able to make these now
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:02:58.620]  But all right 16 to 32 that is old tech
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:03.040]  Androids been shipping with it for years and years and lots of phones. So is it within reach? Yeah
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:05.800]  All right. Let's call it a show
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:11.760]  Anybody I can't imagine that there's anybody who listened to this episode who has not already read your review
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:15.680]  But if or pretended to read it or pretended to read it, but if you haven't you should
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:20.200]  You can do it the right way. The right way is to read it on the website
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:24.820]  That's the canonical version, but I bought a copy for iBooks anyway, because I wanted it to be a bestseller
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:28.960]  Yeah, you got a long way to go to make up for how many shirts I bought from you
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:34.280]  My ebooks are cheap man, it's not $30 for one of these books
[03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:41.600]  I buy copies for your whole family. Great. Great Christmas gift idea, right? Don't don't use family sharing just buy a copy for everybody
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:44.120]  kids will love it, uh
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:50.380]  Always a pleasure. I don't know it's funny because now we have a mini tradition of you coming on after your your
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:54.160]  You know, you'd never ask me on any other time. So now you're gonna have to
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:58.120]  Actually think of some other reason to talk to me. I'm gonna have to think of another reason
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:02.180]  You should have had me on the to argue with you about file name extensions another Canadian guy
[03:04:02.180 --> 03:04:05.320]  Oh, well that we wouldn't had an argument would we?
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:06.240]  No
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:11.600]  But I would I felt like that was a case where I heard you were on my side of the debate and I felt like
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:14.280]  I could have done a better job. Yeah, I'm fending off that foreigner
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:18.440]  Yeah, anytime we get into an argument about metadata
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:25.360]  I'm going to word it far less eloquently as you there were some stronger arguments that you could have deployed
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:28.220]  Anyway, I'll be on the podcast with a joke or sometime. We'll have it out
[03:04:28.220 --> 03:04:31.180]  That's what you get I mean that's what you get when you're from Canada
