[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  fashionably late as always.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  It's pretty good for me.
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  Yeah.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.000]  Eight minutes.
[00:09.000 --> 00:11.000]  You guys do the live thing on ATP,
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  so you've got to be on time,
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  because people are sitting there
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  hitting refresh on the website.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  That's not why we're on time.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  Why are you on time?
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Self-respect, I guess.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  Standards.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Well, East Coast people,
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  you're at East Coast person too.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  You're supposed to be representing for us.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  Instead, you're going to Las Vegas mode.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  I don't think it's that bad,
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  but it is sort of a West Coast personality trait.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  The West Coast move,
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  which is also your move,
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  is like nine o'clock rolls around
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  or whatever time we're doing,
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  and you realize, oh, I forgot about that,
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  and you immediately positioned for a 15 minute delay.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  And then you have a five minute delay after the 15 minute delay.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.000]  All right.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.000]  It's all right.
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.000]  Makes you endearing.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  Oh, you sound like you're in a good mood.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  Yeah, sure.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  Sure, why not?
[01:05.000 --> 01:06.000]  It's been a busy week.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  So I finished listening to,
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  now I'll probably end up as a behind note,
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  because you guys probably recorded last night.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  For context, we are recording right now.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  It's Thursday, October 23rd.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  You guys probably did an ATP last night,
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  but it's not out yet.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  So I might be behind.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  But I did listen to last week's show,
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  where you talked about your Yosemite review.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  We talked more about it yesterday in yesterday's episode as well.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Well, I'll try not to, well,
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  if we venture into duplicating the same story territory,
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  you can just interrupt me and say, you know what,
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  listen to ATP, because I want to do, you know,
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  to know you sway some people's time.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  I'll say the same things twice.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  I don't care.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  The thing with all podcasts is,
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  you know, this is kind of like,
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  it's like a first draft over your thoughts are
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  and you just kind of on the spot,
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  and then you start thinking about it,
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  and you start talking about it,
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  and you know, at least I do.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  I kind of ramble, and it's like,
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  given time to think about that,
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  like, I think I could say that again better,
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  and then obviously the ultimate is,
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  you know, if I'm actually going to write it,
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  I've got to actually figure out what I really think,
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  but just sort of, you know, anyway,
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  duplication, I don't mind.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Give me a second chance to get it right.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Yeah, totally.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  And in a big picture,
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  I was thinking about this.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  I don't know why,
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  because I guess it's just the way that human mind works,
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  but somehow 10.10 feels like a milestone.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  You know, it's like 10.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Even though it's not, you know,
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  it's actually the 11th major version,
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  and it's the 12th, I guess, that you've reviewed
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  because you did the public beta.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  How many Mac OS X reviews have you done?
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  So I did developer preview two,
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  developer preview three,
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  developer preview four,
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  or public beta,
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  and then all the releases,
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  and it was also one or two thrown in there
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  that weren't really reviews.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  It would just like random like,
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  hey, I just went to Macworld,
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  and here's some more stuff you might want to know
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  about Aqua, you know,
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  but if you wanted to go by the releases,
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  I started a DB2,
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  because, yeah, and I don't remember,
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  I think I played with DB1,
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  but I definitely didn't write it up.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  So I'm thinking about this,
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  and you mentioned this on ATP,
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  I don't want to get all modern,
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  but there's a chance you're thinking
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  that maybe this last one that you just published last week
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  might be the last one you're going to do.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  You may not do next years.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  Yeah.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  I, you know, we can get into that a little bit later,
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  but, you know, just thinking in this nice, even round 10 number.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  I do think the podcasts in general,
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  and you having been doing one regularly,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  either ATP or what was your old show called?
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  Hypercritical.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  It seems like forever,
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  but it's not.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  When did hypercritical start?
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  I think like 2011, maybe.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  So it's not that.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  But to me, there's this huge difference as, you know,
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  and you and I got to know each other.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  I don't even know when we first started emailing,
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  but it was a long time before we met,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  but we are at least as email.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  Before Daring Fireball started,
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  because you were working,
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  you were still working,
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  I've told this story on ATP.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  You gave me my first copy of BBed it,
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  or whatever the current version was out then.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  Like previously,
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  I had convinced work to buy it for my work,
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  but you worked at bare bones and said,
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  hey, go, here's a free copy of BBed it.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  I was like, oh, awesome.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  I don't wonder I lasted there so long.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  He's given away this somewhere.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  Sure fire customers.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  We've known each other since before there was even Daring Fireball,
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  and it's, you know,
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  our interests are our common first name.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  The fact that we're, I think we're exactly the same age,
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  even 1973.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Close, you're a year older.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  I don't look older though.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  But I feel like the universe was,
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  it was destined for us to know each other somehow.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Like it just seems like it,
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  it just seems like no matter what,
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  you know, how the dice had been rolled somewhere,
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  you know, in the intervening years,
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  we were going to get to know each other.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  It was a small world back then,
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  like for the Mac nerds on the web,
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  it was just like,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  we were all using IE5
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  and experimenting with CSS and reading Zelda and,
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  like, hoping Apple doesn't go out of business.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  And before that, we're all reading, you know,
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Mac Week, what you talked about on the last podcast
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  and Mac user and Mac world.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Like it was such a small world.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  Like if we had both gone to the same Mac world conference,
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  we probably would have bumped into it.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  Yeah, I think that's almost certain,
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  because it was, it was,
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  they were small and back then.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  Or it was, you know,
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  you would inevitably meet everybody.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  You wouldn't have that.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Yeah, you would see the same people you're after year.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  It's not like WWDC,
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  where now it's like so crazy,
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  and you go,
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  and it's like some of your best friends,
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  you don't even see them.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  And you're like, hey, I didn't even,
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  I didn't even run into some and so.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  And it's just a very different world.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  But as someone who's always been a huge fan of your work at ours,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  these massive book length reviews,
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  it's such a profound change now that you're podcasting.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Because it used to be that John Syracuse as a brand
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  was something you got sporadically,
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  almost like on an annual schedule.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  You had to wait like a year in between,
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  but when you did,
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  it would be like a massive mainline dose.
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  How different it is now that you have a weekly outlet,
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  and we all get plenty of John Syracuse.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  It's so different.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  And it's hard to imagine going back to that.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  Yeah, I had, for a while at ours,
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  when they were doing like staff blogs or whatever,
[06:29.000 --> 06:30.000]  there was a period,
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  and I'm always surprised when I go back and look at it.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  Like, there was a period where I was blogging,
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  as if you want to call it that,
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  pretty regularly on the staff blog.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  Like, I'm amazed at the number of things I wrote there.
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.000]  I forget what I even wrote.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  Like, it's like, you know,
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  it's not the volume that you put out right on a regular basis,
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  but you know how it is,
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  but you can't even remember what the hell you wrote,
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  because it's just too much, right?
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  And of course I remember all my reviews,
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  because those are big punctuated things,
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  and there's a few special stories in between there
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  and retrospectives,
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  and I did like a game review and all sorts of crap,
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  but I can remember those.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  But then there was just like,
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  at one point,
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  I was doing one or two pages every couple of weeks for ours,
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  and I look back on that body of work,
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  and I'm happy with it,
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  and I like it.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  It's just like, it was never,
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  it was, it was neither fish nor foul.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  It wasn't what I do now,
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  which is just sort of ramble on a weekly basis,
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  where it's just off the cuff or whatever,
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  and it certainly wasn't the big long lead up to a giant,
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  you know, review.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  It was kind of in between me,
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  and I guess podcasting is totally filled that role now,
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  because I don't have, you know,
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  and plus podcasting have destroyed my ability to blog,
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  not that I had much of an ability to do it to begin with,
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  but I may get back into it if I don't do these big reviews anymore.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Yeah, I'm not sure you're meant for it.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  I don't know.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  I feel like you've found your thing that is more,
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  it's like, I always say,
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  like to me in everything in life,
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.000]  in this general world,
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  it's the extremes where things are most interesting.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Like to me, like at Daring Fireball,
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  the best posts are my linked list ones
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  where I think of just one word to add, or two words,
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  you know, good luck with that, or something like that,
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  or the big long ones, the thousand multi-thousand word pieces.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  It's when I have a post that's like 300 words,
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  then I know I'm in trouble that I've, you know,
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  I either should be able to make this point much more succinctly
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  or I'm being lazy and I need to go deeper.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  And I feel like with you, it's, you know,
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  you've found your, you're, you're, I'm not going to spend a lot
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  of time on this format in its podcasting.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  It's not even that you're not going to spend all the time
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  or it's just sort of more like less prepared.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  It's like more, more thinking out loud
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.000]  and, you know, going back and forth.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  And the, the blog format, like if I didn't have an actual
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  regular day job that took my time,
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  I think the thing I like about that is not so much
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  that any individual post is anything special,
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  but that you sort of build up a body of work
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  with like little reference points.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  Like very frequently I find myself thinking back that,
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  you know, I wish I had something that I could point to
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  about this in podcasting.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  As you know, it's harder to like, it's harder to ask people
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  to go, oh, go back to this thing and like you have to give them
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  a timestamp and you have to look it up and find out
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  where everything is.
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  Whereas if I could just point to a blog post,
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  oh, I talked about this specific issue in a one-pager
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  and you can get my take on it there.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And individual one-pagers, man, not a big deal one or two-pagers,
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  but now that there's, you know, I have a few of them
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  on hypercritical.co, I refer to them frequently
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  and a lot of times I wish the things I had said
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  and worked out in a podcast.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  Like, I mean, you do the same thing and so does Marco.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  You know, you either write about it first
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  and talk about it in a podcast or talk about it first
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  and that becomes a post for your websites.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And I find it frustrating that I can't point,
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  like the podcasts are so invisible, like they're femoral
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  and then you can't point people into them
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  because it seems like asking more than just having them
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  read a paragraph or two on a web page that you send them.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  So I do wish I had more time to blog.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  Who knows if I even, well, I don't know.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  Like, I'm not forcing myself to do it or whatever,
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  but I think a lot of the reason that, you know,
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  this is kind of where the blog and paneled off.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  Once the, it always tend to really start coming out yearly,
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  first it was like there would just be a quiet period
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  where I wouldn't write anything
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  because I'm just doing the review
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  and then that quiet period expanded to like fill the whole year
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  and so it was like, well, I guess all I'm doing now
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  is Twitter and worrying about writing my reviews.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Yeah.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Well said.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  How do you have you, how many words was your Yosemite review?
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  I think I asked you this last two.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  It's like the same, you didn't read my about post
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  because you followed too many people on Twitter.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  It's like the same like this, it was last year.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  I can't look at the number.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  It's like 26K, 27K, something like that.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Is that a hyper critical?
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  Yeah. Is that a.co.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  But calm guy wants too much money.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Man.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Well, that was what we got for the Vesper.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  We got the.co.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  Somehow it reads right.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  I like, somehow there's top level domains
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  or such a weird thing because a, the whole thing is so gross
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  and never should have been exposed to end users anyway.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  It's like file name extensions.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  But they've become part of, you know,
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  the world we live in.
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000] .com is just invisible, right?
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  Somebody has whatever.com and you just,
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  it's like the, the nothing domain.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  Even though getting a.com is incredible,
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  incredibly difficult because everything,
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  I mean, everything was taken by like the end of the 90s,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  let alone in the intervening years.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  Something about.co, which is for people who don't know,
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  it's the nation, Columbia's top level domain.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  It reads like.com and it's like, you notice it.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  I always notice it.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  I always, you know, but it has that same effect
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  of like, you just accept it.
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  Like that's why I couldn't even remember
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  the hyper critical TLD.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  It's kind of like a, you know, Web 2.0-e,
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  like Flickr where you leave off the R,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  kind of like com where you leave off the M,
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  kind of tweet sort of precious.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  It's that version.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  Maybe it really, I just got it because, you know,
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  all the other extensions were worse.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  I could get.us, you know,
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  a dot business, not plumbing, whatever.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  They're so bad.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  I just, I can't believe some of those.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  Anyway, if you went to the site,
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  you'll see that this, it's my, like the format
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  I've done for the past three years.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  It's just like a template and I just changed the numbers,
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  like Mad Libs, and at the bottom they're stats.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  So 27,000 words.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  What's the, I think that it's like the average size of a novel
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  is somewhere around 60,000 words.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  Give or take.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  So it's, you know, it's truly book length.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  And yeah, the weird thing to me is that
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  my reviews settled in around this 25, 27K size
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  for the past like three or four.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Not through any conscious effort of my own,
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  but it's just, that's how it worked out, you know?
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  Right.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  It's, you know, it's like that's about how much work
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  they can do on an annual basis on Mac OS X.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And it's like, it's more like that's how much I feel like
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  I can or should write.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  Because there's more I could write about it every time.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  I always feel like I basically ran out of time
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  and I would like to hold giant sections,
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  but I always like, I prioritize them.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  I say, well, yeah, I'm interested in that.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  And I think I could write another few thousand words about it,
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  but would the value it adds to the review
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  and the interest it adds to your would be worth the time I put in,
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  you know, and how much time I've got scheduled for this
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  because really, even though I have so much lead up time to it,
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  it's still kind of compresses at the end.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  Because there's only so much you can write about
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  when things don't work and they're broken in a beta.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  And Apple hasn't made final decisions.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  You gotta, you know, the final bits have to come down
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  and then you have to scramble.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  Hmm.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  So if we added them all together, what is it?
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I know that the sizes are different for some of the old ones,
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  but it's about 15 reviews, right?
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  If we're talking about the 11th numbered version
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  and you said you did DP2, DP3, DP4.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  So it's 14 or 15.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  It's an enormous body of work.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  It really truly is.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  And I know that it's not one single piece of work
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  that if you read them all back to back,
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  there's some sort of repetition that would be going on
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  because they follow a certain formula.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  Um, but I do think I think it's such a,
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  it's such an interesting testimony to have
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  and that like 20 years from now,
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  when the youngans take over,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  that they'll be out there for them to, to look at
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  and remember, you know, where things are.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  That's what all people like to think,
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  but young people won't give it to him.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  They already don't.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  Yeah, they don't look back on our great works and tremble.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  Right. How often would we refer to a similarly detailed
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  review of System 2 from 1985?
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  Right. Or that it, you know, the Apple 2 OS's or anything like
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  that are, you know, somewhere somebody would need it though.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  The thing that's brutal for me though,
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  if I ever go back and look at those old ones,
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  I just, I can't stand it just like it's terrible.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  I mean, I don't know if you feel the same way,
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  but like I go up to look at my early writing
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  I'm like, holy cow, this is bad.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  And bad in all ways, like I guess I knew,
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  like it was, it was certainly more casual back then
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  and I was a worse writer and the combination of the two was just,
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  and really, I don't know.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  Like we didn't know what was important and what wasn't
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  the things I focused on or just seem inane and I have a lot of
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  difficult, a lot of people ask like,
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  oh, you're going to go back and collect all these together
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  into one big thing, the most painful part of it would be
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  that if I was to do that and you start reading it,
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  you're going to start reading it from stuff I wrote in 1999
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  that I think is not good.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  She's not good.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  I mean, like I hope I always feel that way.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  I kind of feel that way, like, you know,
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  get to a certain point and I just think everything I write
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  is crap as soon as I write it and this, you know,
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  I just make it as good as I can
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  and time allotted and move on, but it's like programming.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Like if I don't, if I don't look back at the code,
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  I'm writing this year, like 10 years from now,
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  if I don't look back at the code and writing this year
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and think it sucks, that means I'm not improving.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Right, I can totally see that.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  I look back, I did learn this and there's a,
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  I, I'm going to, I'm going to get it wrong.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  I think it was, there's one of the great titans
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  of modern computer science, either Kernigan or Ritchie
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  or one of those, you know, Bell Labs guys who said something
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  about that debugging is twice as hard as programming.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  And so if you write code as cleverly as you possibly can,
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  you'll never be able to debug it because you'll need,
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  you know, you need that in the like twice as great.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  You need to, you need to write your own code like,
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  like you're a half with so that when you debug it
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  or when you, for me, personally it's when I return to it
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  that I can understand what the hell is going on.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  Yeah, I, I know that saying, and I understand the sense
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  but behind it, but the logic in the same makes no sense
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  and it's mostly BS in the details.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  But in broad strokes, trying to say the idea is that, you know,
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  later you will come back to your own code and not understand it
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  and that is entirely true.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  And so what he's trying to say is to mitigate that,
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  don't try to, don't make your life harder
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  by doing things that are difficult to understand even now
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  when you're in the midst of it.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  Right. And it totally informed my use of comments is my comments.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  I used to, I used to only rap, of course,
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  because I was teenager and early 20s.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  And so of course I didn't want to write any comments at all.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  And I only did it because when like my CS professors,
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  you know, you had to, if you submitted your work
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  without comments, it was some, you know,
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  or automatically lose like 10 points.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  So I just, the comments were stupid.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  I would just write, you know, the smart-ass teenager's comments
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  which is just restating the logic of each line.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  I had one done.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  Right, exactly.
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  Whereas, like the light that went on,
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  even though I don't write much code anymore,
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  but the light that went on eventually was comments
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  are like time travel.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  You're talking to your future self who is utterly confused
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  as to why you would do this seeming,
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  there's, this doesn't seem like it's necessary.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  Tell your future self, here's why you're doing this
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  and why you want to keep doing it.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  And it's made my code, at least for my own self maintenance
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  it's made it all the difference in the world.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  Yeah, there's a couple of phases that like the early phases
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  everyone thinks I don't need comments
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  because I'm writing this now and I understand
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  and I'll understand in the future.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  And the second phase is realizing that's not the case.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  And you start trying to write comments
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  but you know what good comments are.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  And I think the third phase is finally realizing
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  that if you write the code in a sensible way,
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  you only need comments on the tricky parts
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  and you should minimize that.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And when you do need a comment on the tricky part,
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  you know like how to write it in a way
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  that will be illuminating rather than.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Yeah, either the tricky part where you're doing something
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  pretty clever and that it's, you know,
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  a month goes by, it's going to be out of your head
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  how you pulled that off because you're in the zone.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  Or for me and a lot of times it's the,
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  you're working around something stupid
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  and the workaround makes, if you didn't know
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  about the stupid thing, the workaround looks like it's,
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  why would you ever do this?
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  This is dumb, just don't do that.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  And writing for your future self is easier
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  than writing for other people.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  Because if you're in an organization
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  where you're programming there's lots of other programmers,
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  at the very least when you're writing for yourself,
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  you can retrace your steps
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  and you will arrive at the same conclusion again
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  but other people won't do that
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  because they react differently
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  to the same stimulus basically.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  So for other people what you're trying to do is
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  you have, here's the one where you put the wise
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  but also like, what is the broader context
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  of this whole thing?
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  What is even going on here?
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  Are there any assumptions that are unstated
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  because you assume they're obvious to everybody
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  but won't be obvious to someone a year from now
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  and yeah there's, like writing comments is basically,
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  it's just basically writing.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  Like it's the same, you have to communicate to people
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  in plain language with the reduced ambiguity.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  Like it's a different goal, a different purpose
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  a different audience but it is writing
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  and that's why programmers are so bad at it
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  because those skill sets tend to not cluster frequently
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  where people who are happy and comfortable programming
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  are not happy and comfortable writing prose.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Yeah, I guess it's true that a lot of times they're not
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  but there seems to be, I know,
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  I know, because we have with Mac nerds
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  where the intersection of liberal arts.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  We know all the programmers who are good writers.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Like Brent.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  Oh, I mean Brent's a great example.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  Yeah, no, I know.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  I mean do we know people because we read their blogs
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  that's how we know.
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  Brent Siegel is another great example, man
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  when he doesn't write much but when he does
[20:10.000 --> 20:13.000]  it is so succinct and to the point
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  and it's exquisite.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  I often refer back, I have a copy of the BB at it,
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  2.2 manual.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  The first public version of BB at it.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  And it's just like a model of clarity.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  It is such a good piece of technical writing.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  Did he write that one?
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Well, I know he wrote parts
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  and there was a couple of other credits up front
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  and there's like a little, what would you call a blog post now?
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  I sort of like, why does BB at it exist?
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  Why on the Mac would you want a programmer's text editor?
[20:49.000 --> 20:53.000]  Who would ever want to edit more than 32k of text?
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  It's more of like a personal statement,
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  like a mission statement for BB at it
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  and it's just terrific.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  I should actually see if he'd let me,
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  maybe I'd see if I can rerun it or something.
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  I think it would be an interesting,
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  especially now that BB at 11.0,
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  maybe I should see about getting it on the internet somewhere
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  because I think it stands up.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  Low these many years in operating systems later.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  All the stuff he writes, if you've met him,
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  you can't help but read it,
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  always because they're such a percentage.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  The mannerisms and the pacing of the way he would say those things
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  it comes through in the writing.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  I just saw somebody tweeted that the other day.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  I don't know if it was to both me and you
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  but to a couple of us where they were like,
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  now that we all have podcasts,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  they can't help but read everything we write
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  in our own voices.
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  And I always hear that,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  and it's kind of nice because it means
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  they're listening to a lot of our podcasts,
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  but I also kind of cringe because it's like,
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  God, writing is where I get to be better.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  Now I speak, I want to say a way smarter when I write
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  because I got all this runway and I could, you know,
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  speaking who knows what the hell comes out,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  but writing, like that's my chance, right?
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  And so it's almost a shame that they know, you know,
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  the stumbling idiots that are behind the words,
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  like, writing is a secret weapon.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  I got all the time in the world to figure out
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  what this sentence is going to be.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  And there's no wasted words and no stupid.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Ideally, I mean, obviously, again,
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  this is a thing with longer views.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  At a certain point, I just got to be like,
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  that's the thing about these longer views
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  and all this stuff like, early on
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  and still to this day in my OS 10 reviews,
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  I'm a slave to getting out whatever idea it is in my head.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  I have a point to make or something to say about something
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  and I have like 17 points to make
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  and 17 things to say about it.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  And I want to get them all out
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  and I sacrifice the quality of the writing
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  many times because I'm like,
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  this could be said more elegantly in a different way,
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  but it wouldn't have this one extra little bit of nuance.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  And I talked to myself, like, what do you care
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  that that one, like, this point is sufficient.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  You don't need to go into this other detail.
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  I'm just like, no, I want it.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  And so I make some awkward sentence
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  and I put that other point in there.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  And I hate myself for doing it,
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  but a lot of times it's like, the overriding thing is,
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  say what I wanted to say
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  and then secondarily try to say it in a reasonable way.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  And that's not the way to make good writing,
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  but that's a lot of times what I do in my OS 10 reviews.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Let's take a break.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  I am going to thank our first sponsor,
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  back for a second time.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  It's our good friends at Casper.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Now, you guys might remember from a few episodes ago.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  I think it was the one with Chuck and Barry,
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  but Casper was a sponsor and had a great response.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  A craziest idea, when I first heard this,
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  craziest idea in the world,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  it's you go online, it's high quality mattresses.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  The ones you put on your bed at really, really good prices.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  Seems like a crazy thing to buy on the internet.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  But in terms, eventually we're going to buy everything on the internet.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  We're going to buy cars on the internet.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  You go there.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  It's two technologies.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  They call it just the right sync, just the right bounce.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  It's two different technologies,
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  text foam and memory foam that they put together.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  It's like a special combination that they've done just right.
[24:05.000 --> 24:06.000]  You don't have to sit there.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  There's not a whole bunch of different things you have to choose from.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  They did it for us.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  They're the mattress experts.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  They've designed a really good mattress.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  I've had regular, I've tried not, I don't own one,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  but I've tried a regular memory foam mattress before.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  I found them way too weird the way that they make an indentation
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  perfect for your body.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  It feels like I'm making a crime scene or something.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  Their mattress isn't like that at all.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  It's just enough of that memory stuff that it's comfortable,
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  but it doesn't feel like you're sinking into it.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's crazy.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  Did you get one of these, John?
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Or was it Casey who got it for ATP?
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  Casey got it.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  We were thinking to get in one just because we made a mattress period.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  So they sent me one.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  This is what they do when they sponsor a show.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  They send one to you.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And it's like, well, how does a mattress show up?
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  Well, it shows up in a little dorm room,
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  a fridge-style box, very small, you can't believe it,
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  but it's because it's like two kinds of foam.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  They like vacuum seal the mattress,
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  and it ships in what is still decidedly a very large package.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  It is way smaller than a mattress.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  So put it in a room where you're going to sleep in it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  Then open the box.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  They've got instructions that tell you exactly how to do it
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  and let it expand.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  But it works.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  It is absolutely amazing.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  It feels like a great mattress.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  I really like it.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And the prices are so much less than the prices you pay
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  for mattresses out in the real world.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  It's ridiculous.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Because the whole mattress industry is,
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  it's just like the Warby Parker story all over again,
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  where it's like a cartel that controls the whole industry.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  They deliberately make it very, very difficult to comparison shop across
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  stores because each store, even if it's from the same brand,
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  like Sealy, they have like six different Sealy's.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  The next store you go to has six different Sealy's,
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  and they all have different names.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Even though they're technically the same mattress,
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  because they do this to make it really hard for you to comparison shop,
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  and know whether you're paying a good price or not.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  Casper cuts out all that crap,
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  and they just sell you great mattresses at a good price.
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  Typical price for a new mattress is well over 1,500 bucks.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  Casper mattresses cost between 500.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  The twin size and 950 for a king size mattress,
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  950 bucks under a thousand dollars for a top tier mattress.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  You save hundreds and hundreds of dollars,
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  and it's completely risk-free.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  They have free delivery and returns within a hundred day period.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  So three months to sleep on the thing,
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  and if you don't like it, they'll pay to send it back.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  No idea how that works, I kept mine.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'm not quite sure how sending the full size mattress works,
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  but they take care of it for you, and I believe it.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  Risk-free, oh, and the last point I want to make,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  I think this is great, made in America.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  Made in America mattresses.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  So where do you go to find out more?
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Apparently, a whole bunch of you guys bought mattresses
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  the last time their sponsorship ran.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Totally encourage you, if you need a new mattress,
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  check them out.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  Go to www.caspercasp.com.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  Now use that code that talk show code,
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  and you will save 50 bucks off.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  There are already low prices on any mattress that you buy.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  So you'll save an extra 50 bucks,
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  and they're going to donate 50 bucks to a charity of my choice.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  And that's, I'll do the same charity I did the last time,
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  the food analogy and a flagship network.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  I'll do the same charity I did the last time,
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  the food analogy and a flagship network.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  That my son-in-wife raised a lot of money for food allergies
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  for kids.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Great charity.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  That's all on them.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Great mattresses.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  Go check them out at caspercleep.com slash talk show.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  Mattresses on the internet.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  What the hell is next?
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  You know what else?
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  People are already buying cars in the internet.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  Yeah, I guess so.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  Do you can't buy new cars on the internet though, can you?
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  I think so, I don't know.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  Speaking of big boxes showing up,
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  I'm actually up today.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  So I started, I ordered it day one,
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  so it must have been a week ago.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  Of course I got a build order.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  And it said three to five days,
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  and it had a target ship date of October 24th to 28.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  And I think it was a wide range because it was over a weekend.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  I did pay, I think it was like 30 bucks for expedited shipping.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  So I checked last night before I went to bed,
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  and it said, you know,
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  I got to notice that my iMac was ready,
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  and it was in China.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  And then at 10 o'clock in the morning,
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  today my doorbell rang and it was here.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  So from when I went to bed last night,
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  it was in China, and at 10 a.m. it was at my door,
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  which is crazy.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Magic of air traffic.
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  I can't help but think that when they told me it was in China,
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  it was already really over the Pacific,
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  but still it's kind of astounding.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  And a lot of people,
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  again, there's never been tweeting pictures of their boxes
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  arriving.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  So first batch came quickly.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Everybody wants to know,
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  I guess I could talk about it.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  Sort of thing.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  I guess I would write a review eventually,
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  but I don't buy Macs very often.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  And then you even mentioned this on ATP.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  I just now replaced a 2008 MacBook Pro
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  that I had upgraded to an SSD at some point,
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  which gave it a couple more years of life,
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  but it was really, really aging.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  And my desktop display, as you know,
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  it's like a 2004, 20-inch cinema display.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  So this is, you know,
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  for as reckless as I am buying a new iPhone
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  every single year, the opposite with Macs.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  I like to get one, max it out,
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  and then use it until it's ridiculously old.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  Now you're going to find out if you have any glare in that room,
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  because I'm looking at the 23-inch version of that,
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  and it's matte, and, you know,
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  you don't know if you have any series glare issues
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  if you've been using a matte screen for the past,
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  however many years you'll find out now.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  If you see your face when you sit down in front of your right eye, Mac.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Yeah, that's one of those things where,
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  I think they've gotten better at it,
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  and I know that it's a sort of thing you can write about
[30:25.000 --> 30:26.000]  and they can advertise,
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  but you really have to see it.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  The anti-glared thing that they've done with the new iPad Air
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  is pretty interesting, but I want to know,
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  why didn't they do it to the new iMac too?
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  Yeah, it's not laminated.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  Well, I think the reason they didn't laminate it is,
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  you know, I assume maybe it's just too hard to laminate something
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  that big, but you know how it is.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  You take the glass off and then the screen is behind it.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  If they laminated them together,
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  I guess you would like take the screen off
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  when you opened it up,
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  and then you'd have to like disconnect the ribbon cables
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  or whatever.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  It just maybe would make it weird to disassemble.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  I don't know, but anyway,
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  yeah, it's definitely not laminated together,
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  and so you've got that air gap
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  which increases the glare,
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  and also that's where the dust gets caught
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  if you ever have to bring in a thing to get serviced.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  Yeah, those are two pet peeves that you and I share together.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  I do not like glare on my displays,
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  and I do not like machine noise.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  So I'm pretty satisfied.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  I'm pretty sure that it's going to be,
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  I didn't take it out of the box yet.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  I had too much to do today,
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  so I wasn't even ready for it,
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  but I'm pretty excited that it's not going to be noisy.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  I'm a little worried about the glare.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  I've kind of made my piece with the glare,
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  because I have the Apple 24-inch display at work.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  You know, the first one that was kind of like the iMac type screen
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  where it looks like it's Thunderbolt display,
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  but 24 inches and it predates it.
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  But it's got the same thing, air gap and the screen,
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  and I'm in an office with fluorescent lights
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  and all sorts of other things,
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  and there are reflection things,
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  but compared to all of my coworkers displays,
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  which are like these Dell or ViewSonic things,
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  or even like their laptop displays and stuff,
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  just the brightness and viewing angle.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  Like the ridiculous brightness of these things
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  have the LED backlit screens.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  You'd never crank onto the brightness in a regular house,
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  but in an office setting where just, you know,
[32:06.000 --> 32:07.000]  the fluorescent lights are everywhere,
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  and it's all super bright.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  The ability to crank your screen up
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  can really power through any other sort of glare.
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  And it's just, it's so much easier to see things
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  in my screen than anybody who is around me.
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  I look at their screen,
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.000]  so you can't see a thing,
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  because viewing angles are bad,
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  because everything is so dim and muddy.
[32:23.000 --> 32:27.000]  There are advantages to this type of design where it's just
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  crystal clear, piece of glass,
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  and a super bright screen behind it.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  Worst case, you can just crank it up again.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  I think it was my wife as a Thunderbolt display right behind me,
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  and I look at that a little time out.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  That looks really nice too.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  So I think I'm gonna be okay with a screen,
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  like the one you've got on your iMac if I ever get it.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  Yeah, and the other thing that makes me feel pretty good about it
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  is I'm okay with the glare on the current MacBooks,
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  like at least the retina one that I have now.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  Those, those are laminated too though,
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  I had the most recent retina.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  I don't know, maybe they are.
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  Oh.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  I think they are.
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  I think, because I think that my first impression
[32:59.000 --> 33:01.000]  when they first had the retina 15-inch,
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.000]  like back at WWC,
[33:02.000 --> 33:04.000]  when we were looking at Jason Snell's or whatever,
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  it was like the colors were like up on the surface of the screen.
[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  The same type of thing you got with the iPhone 4, right?
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  Yeah, so that's my guess.
[33:10.000 --> 33:14.000]  Maybe that's how they keep the whole lid so thin.
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000]  Because it's seriously, seriously thin.
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  Well, I still feel like that though.
[33:20.000 --> 33:23.000]  Do you remember when it was sort of a,
[33:23.000 --> 33:24.000]  I don't know how many years it was.
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  I would say maybe in my mind it was around a three or four year period
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  where there was like this great divide between,
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.000]  for laptops at least, glossy and matte displays.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  And Apple stuck with matte and the whole PC industry went glossy.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  And every time I go, like in a Starbucks or something
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  and I'd see people using, you know, Windows PCs,
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  I'd just be flabbergasted at the how reflective their displays are.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  And then Apple started offering, it was like a choice.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  I know, what do you think?
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  It was about a, maybe the two or three years
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  when you'd buy a new, you know, it's probably the power book era,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  I guess there wasn't even MacBooks yet,
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  but you'd get a choice between matte and glossy.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  And that's one of the things where I never hesitated for a second.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Of course I want matte.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  I think, I wish I could remember this.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  I know what the PC people did for their glossy ones.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  They didn't do what Apple has come to do now.
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  It just have a clear piece of glass on top of an LCD screen.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  I think maybe Apple's first glossy screens,
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  but certainly also the PC glossy screens
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  that sort of kicked off a thing were plastic-y,
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  but it was like super shiny plastic.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  I don't know if it was polycarbonate or something like that,
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  but it had kind of like a sticky, wavy kind of look.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  Instead of what you get from a piece of glass,
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  you know, dead flat and like stiff, you know what I mean?
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  And that made the screens look not only shiny, but also cheap.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  And I seem to recall Apple's first glossy displays being like that too,
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  and that's why it was like, who in the world would ever want that?
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  It just looks awful.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  When they switched to the big piece of glass,
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  a big, heavy piece of glass and made the lids heavier
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  and it wasn't great enough as a huge air gap,
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  at least that looked a little bit classier to me,
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  like more Johnny I would say, more honest materials, you know?
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  When they finally sort of home down, oh yeah, aluminum and glass,
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  we're going to do that for a few years.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  That settled things down a little bit,
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  but even then,
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  I know a lot of people who got the matte display,
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  just for reflection reasons.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  Yeah, I totally did.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  It's just funny though,
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  that used to be a thing.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  And I'm still, you know, because my desktop display is so ancient,
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  I think it's literally 10 years old.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  If I didn't buy it in 2004, it was soon after.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Um, it's, you know, it's like a relic.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  I have to say it was money well spent.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  I don't know.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  I use stayed with 20 inch resolution for so long,
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  because I feel myself just,
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  I wish I could get out of this 23 inch,
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  like 1920 by 1200.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  That's just like barely big enough to contain me,
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  but I feel boxed in the whole time.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  I always, I thought it was too small the whole time.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  But eventually I got used to it,
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  and it, you know, it, it, I don't know.
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  Did you pair it down like your work environment
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  where you like you don't have as many windows open
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  as you would normally have and just kind of try to go into like,
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  I'm just gonna have one central window with a text editor
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  and then off to the side of the web browser
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  with a bunch of tabs and that's it.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  No, I, you know, effectively with a 20 inch display,
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  it's a lot like using just a super sized, like the lunch tray,
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  uh, MacBook, you know, the seventh.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  So do you like to full screen?
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  No, not full screen,
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  but for the most part,
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  everything I'm working on is just in a stack of windows
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  and I have to command tab between them.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  There's not, you know, it's not big enough to do a lot of side by side.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  So I'm really looking forward to that with the 27 inch.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  Yeah, no, I have over the many years honed by sort of like layering
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  and positioning system from our windows,
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  which other people look at and can make heads or tails up.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  But when I'm constrained and I started to have a lot of windows,
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  I start running out of places for the corners to poke out.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  Like that's, you know, the system is like I've got,
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  I've got things in corners and windows sized and shapes
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  and I can find a clickable region.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's just the way I work with Max, you know, starting from the 80s.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  But when I just have too many damn windows,
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  I run out of places to have clickable stuff.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  And if I ever find myself,
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  I can do command tilde,
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  not command tab,
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  but command tilde within an app to cycle through the windows,
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  I feel like I've been defeated by the lack of space.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  So I really,
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  I really can't wait to get a 27 inch equivalent point resolution screen.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  So I can't review it yet.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  I literally didn't even take it out of the box,
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  but having seen it first hand last week,
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  and I know a lot,
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  they're in the stores now too,
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  and I've seen a lot of people who are at least going into look at them.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  It's, it's gorgeous.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  It really is.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I don't rush into it.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  Like I said,
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  I'm replacing at my desk at least six year old computer
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  in a 10 year old display,
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  but it's, I didn't hesitate to buy it on day one.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  And I know you guys talked on ATP that it's risky
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  because, you know,
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  there's a lot of times first generation stuff from Apple
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  has kinks to be worked out.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  Image retention, of course,
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  is a huge question mark at this point.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  I think Jason said,
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Jason Snell did Marco's little image retention test and said,
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  his iMac, which he got already as well,
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  pass with flying color.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  So it seems clear on that front,
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  unless they're using two manufacturers and he got the.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  Right.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  And it's theory that's possible because Snell's is a review unit,
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  and they, you know, I'm almost,
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  I don't know for a fact,
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  but I'm 99.99% sure
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  that they sanity check the review units, you know,
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  that they, they're not like factory sealed, you know,
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  that there's a white glove guy who makes sure that every,
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  that this is a good, you know, there's no.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Yours aren't factory sealed because I just got,
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  for the first time I got a bunch of loan or Apple hardware
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  for the USM and your review,
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  and it looked pretty darn factory sealed
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  right down to the little static links.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  I think they rerapping back up.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  Can you do that?
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  Like that was, that was a game, you know, again,
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  it's a novelty for me to be getting review hardware.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  And part of the game I played was,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  I'm going to rerap these things so they look like
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  I didn't take them out.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  So I saved all the static link stuff,
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  and then I put it back on,
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  and putting it back on is super hard.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  Like you can't get it lined upright.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  No, can you wrap a gift?
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Ah, not great.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  It doesn't look good.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  It looks, when I wrap a gift,
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  it looks like dad roped it.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  It does not look like nice.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  And even no matter how much I try, I can't.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  I know how to do it now.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  And now I've reached the edge where I know what I need to do
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  to make it look good,
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  but at a certain point, I just don't care anymore.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  And like, it all comes down to having the right length
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  overhangs.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  And if you don't have the right length overhangs,
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  no amount of skill unfolding is going to save you.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  And then you realize you don't have the right overhangs,
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  and you try to like trim it while it's wrapped around the
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  thing to make the,
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  and then that just gets a ragged edge.
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  And you just like, you know what, screw it,
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  fold it over.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  Right.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  Good, there comes a point where you're,
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  you set out to make it like,
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  I want to wrap one as good as my wife can wrap a present.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  But eventually I run into that situation,
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  and I think, wait,
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  this is just going to be garbage 10 seconds after I give it
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  to it.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  Yeah, you don't try to think,
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  don't try to think about it while you're doing it.
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  Just like, what am I doing here?
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  Especially when you're wrapping something,
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  and yeah, it's like a gift for your wife
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  and sure it knows what it is.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  It's like, what have we even doing here,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  but like, you just got to,
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  it's got to plow head bravely.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  Right.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  I should just wrap it in the receipt.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  Yes.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  Remember wrapping things in the, the funny pages that
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  kind of,
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  yeah, that was some newspapers.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  That was a huge thing when we were kids.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  Nobody does that anymore.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  Probably because no one gets new things.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  It was like, it was like,
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  it was a new sprint all over everything.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  And it was like,
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  I guess it was just like,
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  our parents saving money on wrapping paper?
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  Yeah, I guess.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  Or maybe, you know,
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  maybe a little bit of column A,
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  saving money and a little bit column B,
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  where all of a sudden it's Saturday.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  I forgot,
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  I forgot it was the birthday.
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  Yeah.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  Well, it's Saturday morning
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  and the party is at noon
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  and you have the gift,
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  you bought the gift at, you know,
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  target the other day,
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  but you didn't buy wrapping paper
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  because you thought you still had a closet full of it
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  and you don't.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  And well, we'll just use the Sunday paper.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Yeah, but that was definitely a Christmas.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  I would say when I was a kid,
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  like lower grade school,
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  I would say probably about a third of all the gifts
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  that I got were wrapped in the Sunday paper,
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  Sunday.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  Well, I wonder how long we have to go
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  with the schoolbooks being wrapped in grocery bags.
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  Oh, I remember that.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  For the covers, right?
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  So I think they still do that,
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  but now the big thing and all of the, you know,
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  the fancy stores,
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  like Whole Foods and everything is to have a cloth,
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  reusable cloth bags,
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  so you don't make all that paper waste.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  So I wonder how long those things will be around.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Yeah, how long can you get a paper bag?
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  Whole Foods gives out paper bags
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  because, yeah, if you don't have
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  the little cloth bag
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  because you forgot to put them in the trunk of your car,
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  they give you a dirty look
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  and they put your stuff in the paper bag.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  Yeah, there's like a passive aggressive.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Oh, you didn't bring a bag.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Oh, yeah.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  So you don't care about the penguins
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  who are going to choke the death on the bag
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  and I'm going to put your stuff in well
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  and enjoy your $5 avocados.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  Organic.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  I've heard that if,
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  I've heard that if you eat organic produce
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  you cannot get Ebola.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  Yeah.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  So there finally is an advantage.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  There's a reason to buy the 89 cents a pound
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  organic bananas instead of the 69 cents a pound
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  regular bananas because it'll,
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  it'll aim you nice you against Ebola.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  And they come with organic fruit flies
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  that will invade your house
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  if you leave them on your counter too long.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  They're adorable.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  They're absolutely adorable fruit flies.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  I might as well, let's take a break
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  and I'll do a second sponsor
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  because it seems like a good, a good time to break.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  But then we'll go back.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  I want to talk about next last week's event
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  a little bit too before we get into Yosemite.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  But I want to take a break and thank
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  while I love all sponsors
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  but I love I love this one a little more
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  than most our good friends at back place.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  Unlimited unbridled backup for your Mac.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  They've been here for so long.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  They've sponsored this show so many times
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.000]  and I always think well,
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  everybody's got to be signed up for them
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  but people keep signing up.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  So there must be a bunch of you out here
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  who are listening to me right now
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  and you've heard me talk about back place before
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  and you've thought that sounds good.
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  I should get that.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  But you haven't done it yet.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Well, do it.
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  Honestly, I don't even mean to run them out as a sponsor
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  but I love this product
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  and I love this company so much
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  and it makes your data safer.
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  You install their software on your Mac.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  You sign up for an account.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  You can try it.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Risk free, no credit card
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  to get your trial period going
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  and then everything on your Mac.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Even if you have external drives
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  and you have, I don't know,
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  three terabyte external drive
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  and it's all filled up.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  It might take a while for that first backup
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  to get everything up there
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  depending on your internet connection at home.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  But just wait, it will.
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  And once it is then from that point forward
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  everything on that Mac
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  stays in sync backed up to their servers.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  They have over 100 petabytes
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  of total data backed up
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  and their users have just crossed
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  the 6 billion files restored mark.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  So when you restore,
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  let's say a catastrophe hits
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  and you lose your whole startup drive
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  and you don't have a backup in your local.
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  You don't have a local backup.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  Well, how are you going to get your whole
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  one terabyte drive back?
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  What you can just tell,
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  they'll put it on a USB drive for you
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  and then FedEx the drive to you
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  and then Ding Dong, the UPS guy is there
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  and you've got a hard drive from them
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  with all of your stuff on it.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Let's say you just need one file.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  You can log in on the web,
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  go to your backup,
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  go through the hierarchy,
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  find that file
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  and restore it right there
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  or put it in a zip file
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  and you can download it right there.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  So good, so easy, super reliable.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Cannot recommend them strongly enough.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  So here's what you do.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Go to backblaze.com
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  slash daringfireable.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  Backblaze.com slash daringfireable.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  They'll know you came from the show
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  and like I said,
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  it's free to get started.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Free, no risk, no credit card,
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.000]  just do it.
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.000]  So my thanks to them.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  Works great with the Yosemite too.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  So last week's event.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  I thought it was,
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  it was a little weird
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  and you guys touched on this on ATP
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  with Phil Schiller.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  Was he flat or not?
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  And I got a bunch of emails
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  and tweets from people
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  were like, hey, what's up with Phil?
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  Was he like something seemed wrong with Phil?
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  He seemed distracted as the word I used to.
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  I didn't notice this during the event.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  I thought Phil was just Phil.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  It's sort of downbeat Phil.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Not just like, this is not a big deal, Phil.
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  And I think it was very deliberate.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  I think it was sort of low key maybe,
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  I would say.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  I wouldn't say distracted.
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  Well, but he's always like that to some degree, right?
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  He's the pace of his speaking
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  and his presenting styles always a little bit weird like that.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  Maybe he was up next to people
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  who were doing more fake enthusiasm about things
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  or being,
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  but he occasionally does seem distracted about stuff.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  Sometimes I feel like he's distracted
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  because he's thinking about the next thing he's going to present
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  even though he's been doing this for so long.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  Like that he's thinking about the next thing he's going to present.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  Trying to remember the things he's going to do in the demo
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  or whatever and he'll get inside his own head about that
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  and like forget to fake enthusiasm about something
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  that he's seen a million times before.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  But it did not stick out to me much.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  I mostly just thought it was just, you know,
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  Phil's a low key kind of guy
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  and this is the way he presents
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  and if you've seen it so much
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  they kind of fades into the wallpaper.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  But I always occasionally see him kind of be distracted.
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  I mean, for all we,
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  maybe he was, I forget if the timing of the thing was just before
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  or after the road trip type thing.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  That a big thing.
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  No, the demo of the guys who like did a typo during the thing
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  and they fixed it in post.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  Remember that?
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  Who made the video, video editing thing?
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  I forget at the time if it was after that
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  it's like he could have been thinking about that
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  because he's like God we rehearsed so many times
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  had to be screwed up this demo, you know.
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  But if it was before that I didn't have an explanation.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  Yeah, what was the deal with that?
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  I didn't know that they fixed it in post.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  I remember I didn't notice it during the event
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  and a lot of people pointed it out.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  Was it a Federigi demo where he'd mistyped road trip?
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  No, it was like people who,
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  third party software developers had a friend
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  who they are and they were showing off their video
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  and they were not native English speakers.
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  The guy who was running the demo machine
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  he fell victim to autocorrect.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  I think it autocorrected Utah to it.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  So instead of Utah road trip it was its road trip.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  And they got shook his head.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  It was pissing himself for like falling victim to autocorrect
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  and then just plowed forward with the demo.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  But then in post they have somewhat good YouTube clip of it.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  The YouTube clip of analyzing this.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  In post they re-screen captured the screen image
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  and froze his image of himself
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  before he does the head shake
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  and then transitioned him at post head shake.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  It was pretty good at it.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  Because it's side by side you see the person you see the screen
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  and more or less seamlessly made it seem like that did not happen.
[48:20.000 --> 48:21.000]  But just fine.
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  That's pretty cool.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  It shows you that Apple sweats the detail.
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  Oh yeah, no.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  Like they rehearse it so many times
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  and you could see the autocorrect bubble
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  or don't it space bar it's going to complete the is.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  My favorite little detail.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  I'm actually, it's like to get the iPad review out.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  I had to shelve it.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  But I still want to write a,
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  write a, during fireball piece on my thoughts on last week's event.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  And my favorite little thing.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  And I'm not surprised.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  And you won't be surprised.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  But I had to double check is that image
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  that they used a couple of times
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  showing a watch, a phone, an iPad, a Mac book
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and now that I Mac.
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  Like that's, you know,
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  I thought clearly like an homage to like that evolution image.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Even though it sort of goes the other way
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  where the Mac was first and these other products
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  came later.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  It's sort of left to right newest to oldest.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  But I thought that was a really telling image.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  I thought it was especially telling
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  that they used it multiple times early on
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  with Tim Cook and then like in the wrap up.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  But I checked.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  And of course they made two versions of it.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  The first one was with an iPad Air,
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  original iPad Air.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  And the one they used at the end
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  when Tim Cook closed, the iPad is thinner.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  And it's, no, yeah, if you look at it
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  inside by side, it's very noticeable.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  That they made a second version with a thinner iPad.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  Even though they're only showing them from the side
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  and at any given moment it was impossible
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  to tell which generation iPad it was
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  from the side.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  Did they, did the iPad, the iPad Mac external case
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  proportions change at all?
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  With the retina?
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Yeah.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  I can't tell.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  Because that's the one I would look for replacement
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  but if they're exactly the same you'll be able to tell
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  like from the side.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  Yeah.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  Like if they had slimmed it down
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  or maybe you can't tell from that angle.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  But yeah.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  And they were obviously very proud of that thing.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  Although when it first came up, I read it as like,
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  I know they weren't trying to make it text
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  but it kind of looked like I guess
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  my low had been on my mind that weird social network thing
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  or whatever.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  It's like, it looks like it could be letters.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  They could spell things out with that if they wanted.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  But that's not what it was.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  The evolution thing is much closer analogy
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  because it's from the hunch thing to the standing up thing.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  So you got to put this whole one on the right even if it's, you know.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  Yeah.
[50:37.000 --> 50:37.000]  Yeah.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  I'm looking at them now side by side.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  They changed the lighting on the iMac
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  in between the two slides
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  and it makes the app, the after one it looks a little thinner
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  but it looks to me though that it's just that they change the lighting
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  and there's less of it and more of it in shadow.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  It's just a different product.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Like it's a different product shot.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  When they brought up the new iMac to take a shot
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  of it, the lighting wasn't the same as when they had that older iMac
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  take a shot of it.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  So it shows up differently.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  I think you linked to a few people talking about this
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  and I mostly agree with whatever person you linked to that was saying like,
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  this is cute and all, but it doesn't communicate to people
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  who aren't already on board much of anything
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  because regular people might not even understand what they're looking at
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  let alone which devices which like Apple was clearly excited and proud of it
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  and we Apple followed with a nerd thought it was clever and interesting
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  and novel because you have to find some interesting way to show these things
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  instead of just like, here's all the screens with black borders
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  that Apple makes.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  They come in different sizes, right?
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  And you know, one of them has a little stand at the end.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  So coming up with new and interesting ways to photograph Apple's product line
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  is a challenge that is mostly relevant to people who either work at Apple
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  or have been following Apple for a long time or as if you throw that image up
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  in front of regular people, I'm not sure how well it will communicate
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  anything or read to them at all, but I, you know, the audience for this Apple event
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  anyone, this is not the iPhone event, this is the lesser event in what was in a town hall
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  or whatever, small room, mostly of interest to Apple follower
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  so it was the appropriate venue for that image
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  but I'm not sure how well it reads everything.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  Yeah, I don't think it, that's why I found it interesting
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  because there's two parts to the Apple presentations, not necessarily two halves
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  but there's two types of messages they seek to convey.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  Some are for the mass market and they sometimes even showed that actual commercials
[52:27.000 --> 52:31.000]  that they're going to put on real TV, they'll just show the commercial right there
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  so it's exactly what they're going to be pushing in their marketing
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  to hundreds of millions of real people through advertising
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  but then other parts are the, as close as Apple will get to inside baseball
[52:44.000 --> 52:53.000]  and that's meant for like us in the media who are then going to, you know,
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  it's like they're playing a bank shot, they're trying to get us to understand them
[52:58.000 --> 53:04.000]  so that when we write about them to the mass market that we're going to have it right
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  so we see what Apple is seeing.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  Yeah, they're going to emphasize the parts that they think will tickle our,
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  the fancy of the Apple fans like they're going to show you the video
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  about the manufacturing process and emphasize the beauty of one particular physical feature
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  so that in the hopes that when you write your review
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  that feature that you might have overlooked, you'll say,
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  well, I just, they showed this whole five minute video of a factory
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  and Johnny I have in his white world talking about it
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  and suddenly that's more prominent in your mind.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  This is basically basically, you know, talking to the press type of things
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  they will, they're never going to show that video of the Mac pro factory
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.000]  the regular deal, but don't care about the macro at all period
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  and certainly not how or where it's built
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  or all the things they did about the unibody or whatever.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  Like they can say it's unibody and they can give the thing out or whatever
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  but they're going to show those, you know, computer controlled milling machines
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  with the water going over them and just talk about it forever.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  Like when they came out with the MacBook Air
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  and then said the subsequent unibody, they really hammered on that
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  to try to get the message across to the press
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  who would then get the message across that, hey,
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  I know you understand what unibody is
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  and I know you're going to see it's one piece involved
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  but it actually makes a difference and it's a big deal
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  and that's the bank shots, you know, five minute video
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  on CNC milling machines and that hopefully translates
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  to a little bit extra emphasis when the first unibody product
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  they're not in the consumer facing product reviews.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  I love this image and I think another asterisk,
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  somebody compared it, somebody on Twitter compared it to one
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  from one of the recent events that Microsoft had for like the surface,
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  probably the Surface Pro 3 event and they had a table lined up
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  in their hands-on area with Nokia phones and Surface Pros
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  and some of them on the table and some of them in a laptop stand
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  and desktop computers and laptop computers, you know,
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  up to, you know, whatever the HP equivalent of an iMac is
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  all of them running exactly the same start screen, you know,
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.000]  this blue, you know, blue colored, whatever the whatever they renamed Metro interface, you know,
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  and what a country, you know, it's a philosophical contrast
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  where, you know, Microsoft went in this direction
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  where you get the exact same interface across phone from phone
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  to, you know, 30 inch desktop display and Apple, you know,
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  and it ends as, you know, reiterated this year, you know, that each
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  of these devices gets an interface that is just for that form factor
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  and, you know, making them very different.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  And, you know, we can even talk about it when we get into your Yosemite review,
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  the way that Yosemite is clearly inspired by the direction that iOS 7 went,
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  but it's even at a glance, just if you've been tuned out for six months
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  and still haven't even seen Yosemite and you took a look at it right now,
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  you wouldn't think, oh, they copied iOS 7, that it's, you know, the exact same thing.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's different.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  Yeah, it's a family resemblance, but it's like a brother or cousin.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  It is not an identical twin.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Exactly. Yeah, like a sibling, not a twin.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  And I think showing these devices in this promotional image for us,
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  you know, this press image where you don't even see the display is in a,
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  in a strange way emphasizes that the, that what you would see on the displays
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  are very different across them.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  And also think, and I think this is always interesting to me and I try to think about it,
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  is what are the things that Apple is trying to convey to us
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  that they can't bring themselves to say for various reasons,
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  because it's, you know, they just couldn't say that.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  And to me, one of the things with this image in the way that they spoke about it
[56:39.000 --> 56:46.000]  is that they don't expect or even want everybody to buy everything.
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  You're not supposed to have an iMac and a MacBook and an iPad and an iPad mini
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  and, you know, a phone and a watch.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  If you do, great, you know, you're a great customer,
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  but if you just have two of them, that's great.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  You know, maybe you have this, you know, like the iPhone 6 Plus,
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  and because it's a huge phone, you feel like now I don't need an iPad.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  And your only other product is a MacBook,
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  and you just use that MacBook everywhere, use it at your desk,
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  you use it when you travel, and that's it.
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.000]  You're a perfect, you're a perfectly encouraged,
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  that's absolutely encouraged, but they can't say that.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  They can't say it's okay if you don't buy this.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  You know what I mean?
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  You can't get on stage and say, you know, there's cool new iMac that we just showed you.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  It's totally fine if you don't buy it and just use a MacBook.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  And we talked about this on an ATP a little while ago about how they,
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  even just within the iOS device range,
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  but it all of them, if you see them head on or whatever again,
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  they all just look like a black border around a color LCD screen of various sizes,
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  but now they really fleshed out the range,
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  especially with the watch being a little tiny thing,
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  and then you have all the different various sizes of iPhones,
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  and the big one and the biggest one gets close to the mini,
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  and then you have that, you know, like it's a pretty smooth scale up of rectangular color screens
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  that you can buy from Apple all the way up to the big giant retina one that you bought.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  But, and as the physical form factors have started to form the smooth scale
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  that they're kind of showing in this image, here,
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  there's still discontinuities, because what is the difference between an iPhone 6 Plus and an iPad?
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  One runs iPad apps and one runs phone apps,
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  and the line between them, you know, we're saying an ATP is probably going to go away since I'm in the near future,
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  because that distinction, like, if you were to get an iPhone 6 Plus,
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  go to the App Store and be like, oh, I totally want this game or this app,
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  and they're like, oh, sorry, you can't, it's iPad only.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  It's like, what do you mean iPad only?
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Like the iPad isn't that much bigger than the screen I'm holding my hand.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  What is it about the thing I'm holding in my hand?
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  That means it can't run a quote unquote iPad app.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  That distinction seems like it's going to go away,
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  but there's the other gap of like you get the, you know, the iPad error,
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  if they were coming up with an iPad Pro,
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  and then to a MacBook error, which presumably go right into,
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  why are these so different? It's like, well, it's easier to explain one as a keyboard,
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  but they run totally different OS as one as touch, one is not touch.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.000]  Like, they Apple is expecting you to pick your spot in their product line,
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  where you feel comfortable because there are discontinuity still,
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  and they're never going to pay for over them to agree that Microsoft does,
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  like, oh, one OS everywhere, because that's not what Apple believes in.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  But in any kind of transition, like there's another discontinuity
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  when you go from the phone to the watch, because it just has to be.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  You can't work the same way. It's just too small or whatever.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  So these little gaps, like if they were to space it out,
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  it would be like watch, big gap, phone, phone, phone, tiny gap, iPad,
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  bigger gap, laptop, even bigger gap, iMac, you know.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  And you're supposed to pick in that range of like, you know,
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  like Chinese food menu, one from column A, one from column B, like,
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  and make up the suite of devices that fill out your life.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  And by having this range,
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  I think obviously someone's not just going to buy the watch
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.000]  and not have a PC and not have a cell phone.
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  Like, you're going to have something in this range,
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  which ones do you think you need? No one needs to fill in all the gaps.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  And they can't say it that way, right?
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Well, they say it in the way, like, we have something for everybody.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Yeah.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  You know, like they just say, look at this range, like,
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  look at the richest of this range.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  There's surely there is something that fits your needs.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  Like, you know, they're fleshing it out, like, diversifying the iPhone.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  And for the longest time, like, the iPhone was the iPhone.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  And everybody wanted like, even now you can say this room
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  for a diversification of like, you know, make one thicker and have longer battery life
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  or something, but like, they've diversified their line to say something for everybody.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And the same way they don't expect you to buy two iPhones,
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  like the big one in the small one or your night phone or your day phone.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  It's the same thing that they don't say that because they think it's obvious,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  but just like they're not going to say, if you buy, you know, a MacBook Pro,
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  we probably don't expect you to buy an iMac,
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  because the MacBook Pro is a completely fully capable, awesome machine
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  that you can do everything on.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  But if you're the kind of person who wants a desktop,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  we would offer one of those two.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Mac Pro, some people wrote to me after the iMac announcement,
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  and they're sort of, I have obviously they've bought a Mac Pro
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  in the last 10 months, and they're angry that Marco right now.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Marco, you know, did not get angry.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  He just went out and bought an iMac.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  But to me, that's so totally not surprising, you know,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  that even though the Mac Pro is a very expensive machine,
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  and it in theory should always be at the leading edge of technology,
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  and it is in a lot of ways that it didn't go retin' at first,
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  or at least simultaneously, and probably not even close.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Like, I know Marco's logic of why he doesn't think a standalone 5K display
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  is going to ship from Apple until 2016.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  It's pretty sound because there's a lot of,
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  I think he probably does need display port slash Thunderbolt,
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  you know, 1.3 slash Thunderbolt 3,
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  because they're not going to do the,
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  they're not going to have you run two cables to drive it.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Yeah, I mean, that was always obvious that there's an advantage
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  of an all-in-one.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  The advantage of the all-in-one has is they can use whatever
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  the hell interconnect they want inside that box.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Right.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  It doesn't need to conform to any specification.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  It doesn't need to, they can just do what you got to do
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  to make it work.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  It all happens inside the box.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  And so you're always going to have an advantage for that thing.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  If it happened that a standardized external interconnect
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  existed for a retina displays in the same time,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Prime is the Mac Pro, the Mac Pro would have had it first.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  But it just so happened that it didn't.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  And then you're like, okay, well, we need to get right now
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  there somehow.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And because the Mac Pro uses the, you know, the Xeon parts
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  and because they're generation behind
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  and because we don't have the external interconnects,
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Apple just did whatever the hell it took to get it done
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  inside this iMac box and don't worry about
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  what goes on behind the curtain.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Right.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  But it does create this weird and in historical time,
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  you know, five, six, seven years now we're going to look back
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  on it and it'll just be compressed and we'll just remember
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  that the iMac was first and everything, you know,
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  the standalone displays were second.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  In the interim though, it is weird that the iMac
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  is going to have these super amazing retina displays
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  and the Mac Pro no matter how much money you spend on it won't
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  and let's, you know, well, I mean, you can get a 4K display
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  not from app right for your back.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And then you'd buy one of those like special, you know,
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  ones for photography that has a bigger color gamut
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  and has better accuracy and, you know,
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  buy it from NEC is like the people who are buying Mac Pros
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  might already have these super high-risk monitors
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  for 4K video editing that conform to different standards
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  than this consumer iMac screen.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  So it's not the people who might be complaining
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  or people who would bought a Mac Pro but didn't really need one
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  and just wanted to have a king of the own machine now.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Right. Right.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  That's because I do think that's what irks them is that now
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  until there's a 5K standalone display.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  And when that comes out, it won't run on the exit,
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  you're going to have to get into that pro anyway.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  They should have known that going in.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  I mean, it's one of the many reasons that I didn't buy one
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  is like, well, if I was waiting for retina,
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  this Mac Pro is not the machine because we know what
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  it's capable of.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  You know, Apple didn't even offer any monitors.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  I didn't want a third party monitor.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And if I did have a third party monitor, I didn't want it
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  to be 4K.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  I wanted what Apple made here.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  I wanted 27 inch, the resolution of my wife's 27 inch
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Thunderbolt display.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  It just doubled the number of pixels vertically
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  and horizontally.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Yeah, that's the thing that really blew me away at first.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I was like waiting for the, well, there's got to be a catch.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  And then I thought about like with the iPhone 6 Plus
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  where it's not really 3X retina.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  2.8 retina or 2.6.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  And they just use scaling to make it work.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  And it looks pretty good, but it's still not the same.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I thought, ah, maybe it's like a scaling thing.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  And then, you know, they gave the pixel dimensions.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  And I'm like, dividing in my head.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  I'm like, ooh, that sounds like actual 2X retina.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  You know, and it is.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Yeah, Dell had it announced a monitor with similar specs.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  So you, as soon as Dell announced you're like, okay,
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  well, this, this must be technically possible now
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  if Dell is going to offer one.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  So once it's technically possible, then it's just like
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  when, when does Apple have a product of this cover?
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  I mean, if the iMac didn't exist, and Dell comes out with
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  this monitor, the current Mac Pros can't drive
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  with a single cable and might not be able to drive with two
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  depending on how they did it, then we just put all been waiting.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  And we'd be like, well, Dell's got these monitors,
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  but we can't have them.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  But the iMac does exist in a gave Apple an opportunity to,
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  you know, we can get as soon as those displays are available,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  we got to get one into one hour machines.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  I mean, iMac is the way to make that happen.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Yeah, so fame is, you know, knock on wood.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Let's wait until I actually take it out and set it up and use it.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  But on paper at least, and from what I've seen in person,
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  this is the Mac I've been waiting for close to 10 years.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  You know, it's going to be a big upgrade.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Oh, huge upgrade.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Ever since I remember when they first started talking about a
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  WWDC in maybe 2006, 2007, but when they called it,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  what did they call it before they had the word retina?
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  High DPI resolution independent scalable UI resolution independence
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  was the thing.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  And I remember, because I mentioned this too, like my fellow obsessive
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  on resolution independence is cable sassar at panic.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  And I remember going to the session at WWDC with him,
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  and we came out so excited.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  And he was like, we're going to, we're going to redo all the graphics
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  and all of our apps is PDFs.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  And they did.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  In fact, they, like panic started shipping apps with with scalable
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  PDF icons and stuff like that inside for toolbars and stuff
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  like that years ago, because cable and I both convinced
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  ourselves, I don't even know what we were thinking.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  I mean, it's not, it's not just you like app.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Like if you go back through my old OS 10 reviews, Apple made
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  promises.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  They're like by 2008, our whole product line will be resolution
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  independence.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  So get rid of it.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I was like 2006 when they said it.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  I think they gave it, they gave a year and a date and like every
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  year, like there used to be a section in my OS 10 reviews is like,
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  you know, resolution independence.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  How's that going along?
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And that would take a little screenshot of text edit in like two
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  X mode or 1.5 X mode.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  And you see what a train racket is, you know, like, and that's
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  why this is still not a user facing picture.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  See you next year.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  We just convinced ourselves that the like retina IMAX
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  were going to be coming out in like 2008.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And we were so excited.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  We wanted to get in line to buy one then.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  And it took until now.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Just I mean, it was so much easier to make the iPhone
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  screen.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  It's way smaller.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  It's fewer pixels.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  And it's just so hard to make it that density.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  You know, so we had to wait a long time before it was
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  economically feasible to make a screen this massive.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  I mean, that was the whole thing with the retina.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  It's like, well, maybe they couldn't do this earlier.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  Like maybe they'll just do it for the 21 inch on Zach.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Right.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Cause they could have gone that they could have probably made that
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  one retina sooner.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  It would have been like 4Kish or 3Kish type of resolution.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  But no, they went for the whole inch a lot of.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And it's really as far as I can tell, no compromise.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  It's, you know, in terms of the number of pixels, the way they're
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  doing it, you know, that there's no, no cheapening out on it.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  It's super bright.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  It's amazing to me.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Cause that was the other thing too.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  During the event last week, after, you know, Phil gave the
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  specs and the size.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  And, you know, I thought, well, you know what, it's going to be
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  power.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  It's going to be this thing.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Cause that's, you know, it's a huge problem.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  All these pixels lighting up.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Is this thing going to get super hot.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  And instead, it takes less power, which is crazy.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  That's the thing that maybe feels good about the machine.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Like, that it's not going to be just at the
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  ragged edge of what's possible to wedge into this thing.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Right.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  You know, with the cooling and everything.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  So they, you know, the GPU is hotter.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  But they made up for it by actually making the screen
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  consumed less.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  My hope is that it's what by not compromising.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And clearly, like you said, they could have shipped something
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  sooner.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  It was like the go 21 inch first or make it a 27 inch 4K display
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  and you scaling to make the on screen elements a reasonable size
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  as opposed to making everything cartoonishly large.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  They could have done any number of those things within the
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  last few years and didn't.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  And I think hopefully it's almost like they're shipping like
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  a 2.0 version of it that they waited until they could get
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  everything just right.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  This is what people who have one sitting in their house
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  tells themselves to make themselves feel better.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  But first generation Apple products.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  This is practically a 2.0.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  I mean, it's so far so, so far so good.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  The only, there was a little bit scary moment this morning when
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Marco and I had a few people tweeting at us to like,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  look at this study, like someone was swiping through spaces
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  on their new retina 5K iMac.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And it was like super slow and stutter.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  And it was like, uh oh.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  But then a million other people tweeted and showed the exact same
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  thing on their, you know, 13 inch MacBook Pros.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  It was just like somewhere in Yosemite but.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  And then hopefully they'll work out in 101, which will
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  hopefully come out soon.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Because I had no reproductions at home.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Like, I mean, even on my, you know, pre-unabody MacBook
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Pro, smooth doing all that stuff.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  But then on my Mac, it worked.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  It had been on for days this running Yosemite.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  I enabled activated Mission Control, which I never
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  knew otherwise.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And it was stuttery.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So I'm like, oh, this has got to be Yosemite bug because
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  we get reports like it doesn't happen all the time.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  The best I can tell is that it's some kind of issue that
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  happens when your Mac is on for a really long time.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  But anyway, there are bugs.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And that was the only scare so far about the 5K iMacs.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  It turns out to be a false alarm.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Yeah, I never know how far I can push it in the hands-on
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  areas after these events.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Like, and there's others who are bolder than I am who
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  will do it.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Download geek mentioned.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  See, I wouldn't do that.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Because they'd stop you.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  There's every one.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  All right, what's the point?
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Like, if people are going to get loan or hardware anyway,
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  then you can test it before all you want.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Like, it's not the thing to do with the hands-on area.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Well, I could see how the people that aren't getting review units
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  would be more tempted to do something like that and see if
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  they can get away with getting.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Or like the iOS devices.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Like, you want to find out if there's three cores in that iPad.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Right.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  So, you know, quickly go to some, I don't know.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  To exploit some crazy jailbreak thing, to quickly get
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  some little executable to run.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  They'll generally cut you off before you get that far.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  But it's funny talking to them because the people who
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  staff the hands-on areas, I think, are all, I know most of them
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  are, but I think all of them work under Shiller in the product
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  marketing division at Apple.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And it's easy to think of them.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  You know, they all wear t-shirts like they're working in an Apple
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  store or something like that.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  But they're all like, in my experience, super-super-informed about
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  the stuff that you're talking about.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Like, if I'd ask them, hey, is this three core?
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Is that how it went from two billion transistors to three?
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  They would know the answer, but they'd also know that they're not
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  allowed to tell me.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Like, they're super-super-informed.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Yeah, no.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  They're totally brief.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  They'd have, they have their talking points.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  They know what they will talk to you about.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  They know specific phrasing for, you know, if you ask them a
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  question about something and they're going to tell you something
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  about, they're going to, they're all going to use the same sentence
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  in the same words.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  It's, it's talking about.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Well, yeah, they are professional.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  But, yeah, and that's all, it's very evident.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Like, if, you know, anybody was there at their first, you know, the
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  first time you get invited to an Apple event and you go to the
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  hands-on area.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  It's very clear that they have a script and they have talking
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  points.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  But the other thing though is that they, they're full-time jobs
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  363 other days a year are working in Apple's product marketing
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  being hyper-informed about all of the technical details of all
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  of Apple's products.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Like, these people know, they know their shed.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  They know the stuff that's not on the script.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And it's, you know, and they're not going to be fooled by
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  somebody trying to download Geekbench or something like that.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  Maybe I could see getting away with it in the early parts of
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  the hands-on areas because it's so crazy and crowded and it's
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  everybody wants to get their hands on them at once.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  You can get away with it, but not for long.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  My thing was I, they were showing photos, of course.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Big images.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Because it, you know, it just shows off the thing.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  They commissioned a guy with like one of those, I think they're
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  called Hasselbads, Hasselbads.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  But, you know, like this camera that shoots like, I don't know,
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  50 megapixel digital images.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And like a cityscape and you can see these details and you
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  can just zoom in and you read like the license plate number on the
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  car and then zoom back out and it's, you know, you can actually
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  see that it's still being rendered in individual pixels on
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  screen.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  But I closed that and went to like the finder and opened up like
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  a safari window and then tried to drag it around the window as
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  fast as I could.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Like that was my benchmark in the hands-on area.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Like, if I drag a window around as fast as I can, does it, does
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  it shear?
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Yeah, like, I think, yeah, that was a good thing to test.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  So, you know, if you think about the first 15 inch red and a
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  MacBook Pro is like scrolling at the maximum resolution at the
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  one that was bigger than the native screen, you know, that
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  that one had a little bit of issues.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  Find out, you know, probably with the scaling and not with the
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  compositing.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  Just compositing has always been fast compositing is pretty
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  easy to do.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  What you're looking for sharing is because you know they have to be
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  driving it with like essentially two display port 1.2 connections
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  or the equivalent behind the scenes and like you would look
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  at like the drive to the left half of the screen.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Right.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Right.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  That's the type of thing Apple would not ship if you could if you
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  could get tearing while dragging windows around.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I mean, Apple never shipped that even when it meant that
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  dragging windows around was slow as molasses.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  You still didn't get any tearing.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  That's like I would have been I would have been shocked.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  But it was like something I had to see to believe.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  But that was the extent that I tested it in advance.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  And scrolling I put I positioned a window right in the middle.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  So if there was a, you know, if it was some kind of two screens
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  glued together trickery that I tried to figure that out.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  And of course it's not.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Um.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  Anything else from the event last week?
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  I guess there's the iPad two iPad air two, which is kind of
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  interesting.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  I think the way that they've gone with the air with the iPads is.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  I tried to write about it this week that it's there's no real
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  annual pattern to it.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  And I don't think it means that it's directionless.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  I just feel like the, the engineering wins that they can pull
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  off each year while maintaining their profit margins are very,
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  very different as compared to the iPhone, which to me seems much
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  more predictable.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  The thing with the top end iPad and the reason I'm still totally
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  in favor of an iPad pro is like, while no one is really paying
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  much attention, they are pushing up the highest end iOS device.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  But pushing up really close to PC class in terms of power.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Not in terms of interface.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Like it still doesn't have a keyboard.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Still, it's still touch or whatever.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  But you know, and it doesn't seem like a big deal.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Like, oh, so what?
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  I run my iOS apps faster and maybe like a game will look
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  nicer or something like that.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  But it's like, it's one of those things where when we have all
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  the steps in between, it doesn't seem so impressive.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Like it's not as impressive as you know, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  where they go right.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  And you're like, wow, they just doubled everything.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Amazing, right?
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  But through a series of small steps, there's going to come a
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  point where new classes of applications are possible on an iPad
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  merely because they've been pressing it forward.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  And there was a little stall there.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  I think a lot of it was like just having one gigabyte of RAM
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  for a long time.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  And having two cores for how long we had two cores.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Like everyone else has gone quad core.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Like the Android space and everything like that.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  So now they're pressing again two gigs of RAM, three cores.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  I don't think it makes new categories of stuff available to you.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  But maybe a generation or two from now, we're going to wake up
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  and say, there are things that the iPad can do that the iPhone
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  can't quite dream of doing yet.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  I mean, right now it's like you just needed extra power to run
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  this bigger screen and the iPhone, you know, is reasonable.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  But like, I think you had just have so much more head room
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  in the bigger form factor.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  So far they haven't really been willing to do it that much.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  This is the first year I feel like they're pulling away by
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  giving it double the RAM and everything.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  But you know, there is room.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  I think there is room for more sophisticated applications
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  to be on an even larger and even more powerful iPad.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  We're just like right now it's kind of like we're inching towards that.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  It just seems like a faster, bigger iPad.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Well, I think the two demos they chose are really good.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  I think they were such great demos.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  The Pixelmator and replay.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Would you say the Shiller mispronounced it?
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  It's the most in the YouTube much.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  So Shiller called it Pixelmator.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  But those are good demos because in theory,
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  if they've already got the iOS app working for the iPad,
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  they could come out with, maybe they will even, you know,
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  maybe when Pixelmator for iOS ships,
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  it will be universal and will run on your iPhone too.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  But clearly editing photos is better.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  The bigger the screen, the better.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  And on a phone screen, you're seriously constrained, you know,
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  and for like the exact thing that they did
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  where they're making like an advertisement for, you know,
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  this big image and they want a superimposed text
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  and, you know, having a laptop-size screen
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  like the full-size iPad,
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  even though that might be small for a laptop,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  it's still certainly, you know, nobody, you know,
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  the small iPad, the mini is vaguely
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  giant-size phone size, right?
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  It would be the biggest phone ever,
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  but it's, you know, you could imagine somebody
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  making an Android phone that's the size of an iPad mini,
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  but not an iPad.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  And for photo editing, it's, you know, size matters.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  And then I think with those replay guys,
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  I thought that was an interesting boy
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  you could never do that on a PC demo,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  because to me, the big part of that is that you've already got,
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  it's the device you use to shoot the clips.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  It's all one thing.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  It's the camera.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  It's the editing system.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  It's the playback system.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Right, and you don't have that with a laptop,
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  like where you might shoot a bunch of video on your phone
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  and then you can connect your phone
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  with the lightning adapter to your MacBook
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  and suck all the video over and open.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  And then you might airplay it onto your TV,
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  so people can see it or put it back on your phone
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  because it must feel gathered around your screen.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  But it's certainly,
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  A, that's beyond the technical acumen of a lot of typical people.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  And B, it's not something you want to do in your own vacation,
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  like in the demo that they do.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Yeah, because it's the type of thing where in your own vacation
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  you tell yourself that when you get back home,
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  boy you're going to spend a day and take all of your stuff
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  and put it on to your computer
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  and make a nice video and send it out to people.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  But you won't, because you get back on vacation
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  and you're rushing around and you're back to your regular life.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Right, and there's difference.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  When you're on vacation, you got the iPad with you,
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  you can do it when you go back to your hotel room or whatever.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Right, or why you're waiting for your table at dinner
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  and just suck these clips in and push a button
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  to finish the video pop out that you could post.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Share right there and then say,
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  hey guys, this is what we're doing on our vacation.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  The other thing that's lurking for the iPad,
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  which we still haven't seen,
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  but people have poked around, like the whole split screen
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  multitasking, which we know is lurking the code for splitting
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  multiple apps into thirds and quarters.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  It's there and obviously it's not baked yet
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  and then I'm ready for it and maybe you need a bigger iPad
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  or whatever, but that's what I'm talking about
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  of like pressing the limits of what can be done on a touch device.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  I can't help but think that going to two gigs of RAM is a sign
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  that if there's an iPad pro in like five months from now
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  or, you know, because that's the rumor is, you know,
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  maybe like February or March, they're going to have an iPad pro,
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  you know, 12 or 13 inches or something like that,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  and it'll have split screen.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  My guess is that this iPad, if that's true,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  this iPad Air 2 will get the split screen too,
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  but no other iPad will because,
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  it's not enough room on this smaller one.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Yeah, I think it's not like they've promised it,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  but, you know, in fact, I guess they still sell the,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  I think the original mini, which they're selling for 249,
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  is only 512, makes a RAM.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  And, you know, you guys talked about an ATP,
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  but it's the frustration with the growing range
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  from bottom high end to low end,
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  is that developers don't have the ability to say
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  this app only runs on the iPad Air 2
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  because it's so graphically intense.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  You can't do that.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Your iPad app has to run at least launch on all iPads.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Yeah, but that's something Apple has the flexibility
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  to change at any time, though.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  It's an app, just an App Store rule.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  They can change the rule at any time.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  They can give you a little API
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  and a point update to definitively say, you know,
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  because they keep bragging about, as Marco pointed out,
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  that big chart that shows the GPU speed
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  that goes up like a big hockey stick.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  Look how far we've come.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  The A at X, it's GPU is so incredibly powerful,
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  and yet they're still shipping the second dot on the graph,
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  the second lowest one, right?
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  It's like, well, it doesn't help me,
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  because if I got to make a game that runs on that second dot,
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  it's actually frustrating to me the A at X is out there,
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  because now I got to make a game that scales from all the way out.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  At the, I can't believe we used to live like animals
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  like that end of the hockey stick curve.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  We'll just remove texture mapping in that version.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  It'll just be flat shading.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  But I do think that there's a general, you know,
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  just of it is if you're an iPad app,
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  or a modern iPhone app,
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  you can more or less assume that you have access
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  to about a gig of memory if you need it.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  So I feel like this, I feel like the iPad Air 2 getting 2
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  is a sign that if there's split screen,
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  it'll get it, and I don't think the other ones will.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Yeah, and it's just time for a 2 gig.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  It's kind of sad that the iPhone doesn't have a bit of the very least.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  You can make some kind of battery life excuse for the phone.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  I mean, maybe like it's like it's borderline.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  They made it half a millimeter thicker.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They gave it 2 gigs of RAM.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  It would be a different device, but you'd have more.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  Yeah, and there's a, there's a Quora post.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  I haven't linked to it from Daring Fireball
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  because I feel like it's a little, I don't,
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  I can't verify it myself.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  And it seems a little bit too raw raw apple
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  even when they, even when they don't,
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  even when they don't put enough RAM in the phone,
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  it's, it's all good.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  But the expert, if somebody asked on Quora,
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  why did the new iPhone 6 only still only have one gigabyte of RAM
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  when a lot of the top shelf competitors on Android have two?
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  And like the top ranked answer was somebody saying that it's,
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  there's probably a whole bunch of other reasons too,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  but a big one is that a garbage collected system like Java
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  needs double the RAM of a non garbage collected system like iOS
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  and that they've linked to an academic paper
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  that showed how, you know,
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  if you can give a garbage collected system enough RAM,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  it, it all just works out.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  But when a garbage collected system gets RAM constrained,
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  it goes to hell.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  And everything gets gummed up waiting for memory.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And I think there's something to that.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  I do think that, you know, the iOS because it's not garbage collected
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  can get by on one gig longer than it,
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  than like Android could have.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  But I still, you know, it's still irritating every time I go back to Safari
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  and my tabs have all been flushed.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Yeah, and that's that kind of, that's the real luxury of buying the top end iPad Air 2
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  was going to get you.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  It's like, oh, thank God, I can go back to Safari.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  A, Safari is still running itself and B, the tabs that are in Safari.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  I just had, I noticed with my review unit,
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  my first right before, about an hour before the show,
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  I was flipping through your, your, your, uh, Yosemite review.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  And, uh, it had finally gotten flushed from memory,
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  but I hadn't been in Safari for a while.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  I had been doing a lot of other stuff, but it's a big giant red image
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  that are in that review.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Can, yeah, can do that to you.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Yeah, that was the first one that it, that it got flushed.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And it was definitely noticeable.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Uh, I think it's super interesting too that they've gone,
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  they've so out now, I don't want to say out class,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  but it's, it's so noticeably faster than the iPhone 6
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  and any kind of benchmark because it has, you know,
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  it's a faster, it's a faster single core,
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  and it has a third core.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Yep, and the GPU is more powerful because that has to push more pixels.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And I think it may, I haven't looked at the specs close enough,
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  but I think they may be like it, at an overpowered point where
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  it's not just like the same speed as, as the iPhone 6's GPU,
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  but it just has to push more pixels.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  It's like, it can push the more pixels and then some.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  And I, I got to talk to, I just happened to be my seat
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  in the event last week was right behind the, uh,
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  was like front, towards the front, like fifth row on the left
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  and the demo guys were all in front of me, like right in front of me
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  where the, the replay guys and two rows in front of me
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  were the pixel meter guys.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Uh, and I know the pixel meter guys because they've sponsored,
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I think they've sponsored the show,
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  but I know the sponsor during Fireball many times.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  And I've emailed them, you know, ever since the 1.0 came out
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  and I was like, wow, somebody actually used, you know,
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  core image and all these other cool Apple technologies
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  to do the thing we've been talking about for 15 years
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  and have an indie rival to Photoshop.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  Uh, so I've known them by email, you know, since forever,
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  first time we ever met in person, I was awesome to be able
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  to congratulate them in person because what a, you know,
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  what a moment, you know, you get to be on stage at an Apple event
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  and demo your app.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Um, and that ends up, I know the replay guys a little bit too.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  I didn't recognize their names when they first got called up,
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  but they've sent me, you know, just, you know, as the guy
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  writes during Fireball, they've sent me emails on various things
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  over the years.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And, you know, we were right there in town hall.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  We had a couple of minutes before they were going to kick us out.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  And they're, you know, they're not going to just give me any kind
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  of state secrets about what, what life was like the last couple of weeks
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  while they were working on this, but they, you know,
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  they could speak a little bit.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  And both of them, like the replay guy said that he thinks
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  if anything, Apple has completely undersold the graphics
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  performance of the AADX that, that when, you know,
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  from what they were doing the last couple of weeks getting the demo
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  together for replay, that it was way faster than what Apple is saying
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  compared to like the iPhone 6.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  That's the thing about the power on these, like they're putting
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  so much power into iPad and building up to the next sort of,
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  the next sort of big leap, like we're going to have to,
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  we're going to be able to get a different class of applications,
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  but especially for graphics performance,
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  the, the, the different class of application that you can get
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  is a extremely graphically six sophisticated game.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  And you're never going to really have one of those on,
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  on the iPad Air 2, because it's the same reason like when,
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  you know, when like a watchdogs or, you know,
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  what it would like, you know, shadow of more to orchestral
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  because it's cross platform, but at any like modern console game
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  that's on the current generation consoles,
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  there's no we part of those because the we is standard definition
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  and incredibly weak and there is no way to scale a modern
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  PlayStation 4 game that all the way down to something that's that darn,
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  like there's not, you can't, well,
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  we'll just use fewer vertexes and lower resolution textures
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  in the game will run fun.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  It's just not possible, right?
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  You cannot take a game and scale that.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  So any game that takes full advantage of the 8X,
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  I don't know if you can make a version of that game
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  that also runs on the $249 iPad mini within a five and five.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  I'd like, there's nothing you can do to the game to make it run on that.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  And so like, you kind of stuck, you can never make,
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  you can never make an app that can really take advantage of that GPU
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  because really have to think either games or like scientific imaging
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  of the only two things that you could do
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  could really use the GPU like that.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  So it's kind of, it's kind of a shame that that, you know,
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  I mean, I guess you can do core image effects really, really fast
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  and the, you know, the A5 can do core image effects.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  The same one's just much slower and that's how you can get away with doing something
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  like Pixelmator on both platforms, but games,
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  I feel like people are stuck there.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And also, if you're those type of games that graphical sophistication
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  costs so much money to make, you have to sell a lot of them.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  And I'm not sure that the touch interface is sufficient to, you know,
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  be it, you know, to sell a game like a $500 million game
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  like Destiny to the iPad.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  I don't know if you could, you could sell that
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  with people who are going to be swiping on the screen.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  This is great because now that I have a 10 year old son,
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  I actually am familiar with just about every title that you've mentioned,
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  including Destiny.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  Do you have, did you end up getting a PS4?
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  No, you know what we have.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  Oh, did you have the free Xbox box?
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  And it's, I don't know what to do about it
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  because I kind of feel like the PlayStation 4 looks like the better,
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  the more time goes on looks like it's the better platform.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Well, so do you have Destiny?
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Yeah, we have it on the Xbox.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  Yeah, so there you go.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Yeah, pretty good game.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Have you played it?
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  Just, just a toy around a little bit.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  It's, you know, I'm total like the old man to learn into play games.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  But it's, you know, it's really, really graphically.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  You should, you got an Xbox.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  You should check Xbox Live Arcade.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  I think there was a version of Crystal Quest.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  You can tell you, you get about it.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Son, let me tell you.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  I was a kid.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  This is what we played.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  Although you can't play Crystal Quest.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  It's a friggin thump stick.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  No, but anyway.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  You need a mouse.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  Do they really have it?
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  Yeah, I believe, and then maybe now in the Xbox one,
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  but way back when I was either on the original Xbox or the 360,
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  Cassidy and Green, I think it was the actual real company
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  made a part of Crystal Quest for Xbox.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  I do think, I do think though that this is,
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  it games in particular.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  I do think that they're really pushing Apple to open up the
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  App Store to, to hardware limit that the app somehow.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  You know, if they already let you limit it by OS,
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  I just can't see why it's getting to be untenable
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  as they extend the life of these, you know, these devices.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  And that's the thing that the, as Alan Pike called it,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  the zombie iMac, that $249 retina, not retina.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  I pad many, the original iPad mini,
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  which is from two years ago, is really from four years ago
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  because the A5 system on a chip and the 512 megabytes of RAM
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  and everything is really it's the iPad 2 shrunken down.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  Like the iPhone 4S right within the same generation as that.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  Yeah, it must have been around the 4S.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  A5, yeah, no, I know.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  My iPad touches the same thing.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  The 512 megabytes of RAM at A5 present.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  So they've actually, it's just in a weird way,
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  like they've actually, the lineup, I think only has a,
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  it goes A5 at $249, but then there is no A6 iPad left.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  They're already gone.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  So it's, it's like a year behind,
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  an extra year behind the next step up.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  It's, it's a really old piece of technology.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Yeah, I don't know, like, and again,
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  we've said this, we keep saying this every time,
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  you know, the middle came out and now the A8X,
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  or it's like, and the Apple TV playing video games
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  on your television through an Apple device
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  is like just sitting there in front of Apple for you.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Like they've got, they've got every single freaking piece
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  of the puzzle, they just don't have the desire to do it,
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  but just fine, like you can't be in every business.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Maybe they don't feel like they want to enter that fray,
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  but as they accumulate the pieces,
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  especially with metal and the Apple TV,
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  and like they're building their own arm chips
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  with these crazy GPUs in them.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Like I, I don't necessarily recommend that they go for it,
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  because I don't think they're really equipped to compete
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  in that space, but it's just so weird to see them.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  It's kind of like when it was back at the e-book,
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  the dawning of the e-book era around 2001, 2002,
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  when it was like Apple's got these iPods,
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  and they've got a way to sell the things digitally online
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  with the iTunes store, and like they have all the pieces
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  to dominate the e-book space.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  Like they basically, you know, I think this is maybe
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  even before the Kindle came out.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  It's like, or maybe around the same time,
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  the Kindle was eating, it wasn't quite the same thing.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  It's like, why is Apple not, you know,
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  the e-book market is there for the taking for Apple.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  They have all the pieces, they have the momentum,
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  they could, they could do it.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  They're just not interested.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  And eventually they kind of like, yeah, I guess we'll do e-books too,
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  but then it was too late.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Amazon was the dominant player and i-books
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  kind of an also ran, and the gaming space obviously
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  has been heavily populated for years and years,
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  but here's Apple just dutifully working
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  to essentially build the ingredients of world-class
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  gaming console platform, and then just not doing that.
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  Yeah, it's, like you said, it's laying right in front of them
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  because the A8X, I think the A8 is probably pretty good,
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  and you could make a reasonable gaming console out of it,
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  especially with metal, which, you know, again,
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  talking to, you know, developers, you know,
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Apple calling it 10 times faster than OpenGL seems fair.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  It seems like in real world-
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  No, no, that's a BS.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Well, because it's 10X in like, you know,
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  if you do something stupid and you're just measuring draw calls,
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  it's a micro benchmark.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  But the thing is, that type of low-level API,
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  every game console has something like that.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Apple has something like that.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  Well, that's the, that's the advantage Apple to modern Apple
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  today has is that they have enough developer support
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  and so many customers that they can get developers to use their thing.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  To port, like to port all their game engines, you know,
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  that Unity and Unreal 4 engine, everything like,
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  we'll make a port solely for, you know, so they can sell iOS games, right?
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  Because that's a big market.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  They make a lot of money off that.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  So all those engines are say, yeah, hell yeah,
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  we'll, we'll make a port of our engine to, to metal,
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  and then everybody who builds games on our engine
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  will be able to take advantage of it, and like,
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  to build the full-fledged console,
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  they have to do something like wimpy, like the, not wimpy,
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  but like lower-powered, like the PlayStation TV or something
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  because the A8X is not going to compete in power
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  with the PlayStation 4, but there's not,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  but there's no reason that Apple couldn't build a device
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  that can piece with the PlayStation 4.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  It would not be just an A8X in a box,
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  but like by making the A8X and metal and having a store
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  and talking to game developers and getting the engine support
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  to their technology shows that if they wanted to,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  they could make a product like this
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  that is of similar power to the PlayStation 4,
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  wherever the next generation is,
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  and decide to compete in that space.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  I don't, they just don't want to, which is fine.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Like it's all about what do you say yes to what he's saying into it.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  Like the, the recent Tim Cook interview where he keeps saying like,
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  there's plenty of things we could do.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  We have plenty of great ideas.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And we don't, we don't not do them
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  because we're not capable of them.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  We just choose what they want to do.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  And thus far, they have not made this choice.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  Just like for all those years,
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  they chose not to enter the ebook market.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  Well, or even honestly even chose not to enter the phone market.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I mean, people were clamoring for an Apple phone,
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  ever since cell phones became consumer priced items.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Yeah, well, that's because like they hadn't figured out
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  what they wanted to do for a phone.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  You're like, that's different competing internal products
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  and everything.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Whereas the game console, the reason you don't do is like,
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  well, we're just going to make another game console
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  like everybody else.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Like they've seen like they don't want to enter the space
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  until they feel like they have something significant to add.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Right.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  And with the iPhone, they didn't enter the phone space.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Like they did the Motorola rocker and all that slings
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  but they didn't feel their own phone.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  That was just like a candy bar phone.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Right.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  They didn't enter the space until they had something.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  Right.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Even though their candy bar phone would have been the best candy bar phone.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  They just didn't.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Right.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  And that would have hamstrung them
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  because that would have made an interesting iPhone harder
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  because then you got to transition people.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  What about my old Apple phone?
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  I liked it.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  What is this new thing blah, blah, blah?
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  Whereas if the iPhone is your first phone.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  No problem.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  And lastly, the performance thing.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  And again, I don't often go to benchmarks when I write reviews
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  but I really just think it's so fascinating
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  how quickly the high-end iPad is gaining
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  on the low-end MacBook Airs.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  And again, it's not Apple's Dapples
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  because OS X and iOS have so many different interface things
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  and just rules about multitasking
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  and how much stuff can be going on in the background.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  And how much RAM you can get like a MacBook Air
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  with like 16.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Exactly.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Which can have enormous performance,
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  especially not even benchmark, but just real-world,
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  you know, real-world advantages
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  because when you're switching between these things,
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  you know, they're all still in memory.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  And I would have to think the SSD storage
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  on the Airs is also a press like,
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  I think this is the first generation of iOS products
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  to use PCI Express for the SSD connections.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  I heard that as a vague thing.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  I haven't seen like an iFixit hair down,
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  so that's the case.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  But like, but they've been doing that on MacBook Airs for a while.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  But yeah.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  I heard that I saw a thing on Twitter last night.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  Again, not verified.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  It's not like somebody showed pictures of it.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Yeah, somebody seemingly reliable said it's PCI Express,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  which is, you know, it's desktop.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  You know, when they say desktop class performance,
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  they're actually, they're not hyping it.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  They're being serious.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  And that's what, like, that's the gates,
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  that type of stuff, the more boring stuff.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  If you're not playing a game,
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  the thing that gates your performance on just using your iOS device
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  is a amount of memory you have
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  and how fast the storage is.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Because what do you think it's doing
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  when you're launching an app and putting an app
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and launching this app?
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Like, it's not the CPU is mostly spending its time waiting
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  for iOS during those times when you're waiting.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  Yeah, which is exactly why I splurged
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  and cut the SSD storage for the iMac.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  I feel like my last spinning hard disk
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  that I've ever bought, you know, is in the past.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  I would like mine to be in the past,
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  but they're not getting that.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Well, other than external drives that I would use
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  for like backup or something like that,
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  where I'm not going to be waiting on it as a user.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Even then, like at work on my machine as SSDs
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  for all the stuff that I use,
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  but my super duper clone is spinning.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And it's just so painful.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  Like how long a super duper clone makes.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  It's just, you know, it's just like read from the SSD
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  and then just like go get a coffee.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Oh, the spinning hard disk wrote.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Okay, I'll read one more thing from the SSD.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Like just see super duper.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  So it's so asymmetrical.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  So I would love to be all SSD,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  but unfortunately I keep accumulating stuff
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  and SSD is set up for the reset button.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Like storage used to be scaling with my digital hoarding.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  And then SSDs would be like,
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  oh, no, actually.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  It struck everything with like that.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  It's just now barely catching up again
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  with one terabyte SSD.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Right.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  All right, let me take a third break here
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  and thank our last sponsor,
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  another long time friend of the show,
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  our good friends at Squarespace.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  And they've got brand new Squarespace 7.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  It's an all new interface to Squarespace.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  You don't have to do anything.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  It's not like a new product you have to sign up for.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  If you're already on Squarespace,
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  you can just opt in to get the new interface.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  But they've done an enormous amount of work.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  It's a huge upgrade.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  And it's all of it is to make things simple,
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  simpler and easier while retaining the power
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  and complexity of the Squarespace platform.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Right.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  So what is Squarespace?
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  It's you need a website.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  You go to Squarespace.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  You sign up and now you have a website
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  and they aim to solve all the basics
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  of your online identity by providing easy,
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  beautiful solutions for your website,
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  for email, for images, logos,
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  domains.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  You can do domain registration for them.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  And everything that they've learned
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  from the millions of websites.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  And that's they have millions of websites
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  people have built using Squarespace.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  And they've looked at where people were getting stuck
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  with what Squarespace was before.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And they've addressed it.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  So some of the new features they've added in Squarespace 7.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  They have title pages, cover pages.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  So if you want to put like even brand your product,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  you're using Squarespace to promote your product.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  You've got a brand new feature.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  You can add a cover page,
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  sort of like what Apple does with their home page.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  You can have a cover page that people will see
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  and click through before they go to your regular home page.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  All of their editing stuff they do,
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  instead of going into a separate mode
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  when you're logged in, you can just drag and drop
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  to edit right there on your actual website.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  It's a lot more wizzy wick.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  Your website will look exactly like you arrange it.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  You don't have to have one window where you're in an editing mode.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  And a second window where it shows it
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  and you have to keep switching between the two windows
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  and reloading to see it, you just do it right there in place.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  They have new taste maker templates.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  They're working with cool musicians, artists,
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  architects, and chefs to develop new templates
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  that cater to each of those professions.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  So, whatever field you're in,
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  whatever you're building a website to promote,
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  they're expanding the range of templates
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  that are automatically laid out
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  to integrate with what you need to give you
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  an interface that's exactly what you would want
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  if you are, say, setting up a restaurant website.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  All sorts of cool stuff like that.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Easy. You go to squarespace.com.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Slash Gruber, GRU-B-E-R.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  My last name is Squarespace.com slash Gruber
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  and they have a discount code when you sign up.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  That's just my initials, JG.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  10% off.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  So go to squarespace.com.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  Check out all of these.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  I can't, I would take half an hour
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  to go through all these features in Squarespace 7.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  There's so many of them.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  Go there, check it out.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  They've got a great, great demo set up
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  to show you all the new features far better
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  than I could describe them.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  So go check them out at squarespace.com slash Gruber.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  So let's talk to Yosemite for the rest of the show.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  Sure, 140 in, let's start.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  My son calls it Yozamite.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  Yep.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  I'm the nickname of mine.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  I think he says.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  It's as exactly as funny.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  I didn't think about kids, but that was exactly
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  what people said coming out at WWDC's.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  The keynote is people don't know how
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  to spell Yosemite.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  People don't know what Yosemite is.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  And then when my son started talking about Yozamite,
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  I was like, oh, well, it doesn't really matter.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  It's free.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  It's not like they need to sell it to people.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  I think the visual thing, if it is anything
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  that maybe I thought you underplayed
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  was talking about the visual redesign.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Because I know you care,
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  but it's also a hard thing to talk about.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Do you think I underplayed?
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  I spent a lot of words in that.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's like the longest section in their view.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  It could have been longer, in my opinion.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  Because I guess the other thing, too,
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  is that you know that they're not,
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  we're going to have something,
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  they're going to improve it.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  And next year's we'll look a little better
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  and it'll look a little better.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  But I think this is basically
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  what we're looking at for the next,
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  you know, at least probably a decade on the Mac.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  Yeah, probably.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  I forget what I put in my review and what I cut,
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  but one of the things I mentioned in the most recent ATPs,
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  this is the thing that Apple does
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  when they have a new fancy design that they like.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  They did it with iOS 7,
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  they did it with the original Aqua
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  and 10, they did it with the various looks
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  in between like brush metal.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  They tend to err on the side of going too far.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  With the look.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  And then they back it off later in response to complaints.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  And so like iOS 7 is the most recent memory
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  where they have a super thin fonts.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  And everything was just, you know,
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  maybe a little bit too precious.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  And the parallax effect and the zoom and everything.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  And so you add the thing to reduce motion.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  You're thicken up the font a little bit.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  And you make adjustments.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  And that was mostly done before release.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  With Aqua, original version of 10, 10
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  just crazy pinstripes everywhere.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  Super glossy and likable, all faded and soft lighting
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  like everything was shot with Vaseline on the lens.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  And they backed that off over years
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  hardening up the edges,
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  towing down the pinstripes.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  And then brush metal came in and everything was freaking metal.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  The version of towing that down was getting rid of it.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  But like going too far and then backing off
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  is preferable to them.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  It seems then not going far enough like being timid.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  So your somebody is,
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  and I kind of bemoan that in the review
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  or the part that I cut from the review.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  I don't know what's in there anymore.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  It's saying like wouldn't it be nice
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  if we could skip that part where they go too far
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  and just go right to the part
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  where they tone it down a little bit.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  And maybe they feel like they don't know where they need
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  to tone it down.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  Like the checkbox to make the menu bar not translucent
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  because the translucent menu bar,
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  the original one and leopard,
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  which is crazy translucent.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  It made everything unreachable.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  And now they feel like they have the confidence that like,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  well, this menu bar won't be unreachable
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  because we have this crazy algorithm
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  that will blur everything together
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  and is aware of contrast.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  And it will just look muddy and indistinct
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  but it won't be unreadable.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  So no more checkbox to disable that.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  And it's like, you know,
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  there are places where they went too far in this
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  and there are a bunch of adjustments that are already there
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  but none of them sort of,
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  none of them tune it to be the way
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  we hope it's going to be in the next two revisions.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  A few hours before the show started,
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  I linked to Koi Ven's review of Yosemite,
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  focusing solely on the appearance.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  And I know you heard my feeling
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  and you said it was your favorite.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  Well, I thought yours doesn't even count.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  I mean, yours is...
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  No, no.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  Anyway, yeah, no, I read his thing
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  when he originally posted,
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  but yeah, I mean, it's a similar sentiment.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Yeah, it was 10 Balboa
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  and it was 10 Palisades.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  It kind of looked great.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  And I think that is totally true.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  I'm basically on board,
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  completely with the basic style
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  but there's definitely some toning back
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  that I think needs to be done.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  Also, my big complaint
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  that I just complained about ATP
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  was the transparency effect.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  I spent a lot of time explaining
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  what the different kinds of transparency are,
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  how they work,
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  and then here's how they're deployed in the OS.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  And all the stuff about the rearrangements
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  of the UI stuff like that.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  And then I had this whole section called philosophy
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  which is I kind of tried to isolate the part
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  where I'm going to try to unpack this.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  Here's what it is,
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  here's what it's looked like,
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  here's where they use it,
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  and then it's like why?
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  Why is this there at all?
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  What is it about what's behind my menu bar
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  that adds to my life?
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  Why do I need to see that?
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Why do I need to see any of that?
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  Right?
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  Because there's always some kind of philosophy behind it.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  Like the original Aqua,
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  it was like transient elements
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  where a translucent.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  So sheets just appear briefly and go away.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  Drop down menus, appear briefly and go away.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  Those are translucent.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  It's a temporary thing.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  And there's a logic to it.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  Right, but on the other hand,
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  the dock which was always there
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  was also translucent.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  So it's just like, well,
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  a few translucents.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  He's cool, right?
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  So, and here, like,
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  you know, several times I've asked Apple
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  about the effects
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  and during the different keynotes
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  they've said,
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  here's why we do it.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  And they have reasons behind them.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  And I have to look at those reasons
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  and say like,
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  is this a reason for you to
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  pollute all of my side bars
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  with the color of the desktop background?
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Like, sometimes the justification can work out,
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  but other times I don't buy it.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  Like the whole thing of making the,
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  you know, the temperature and mood
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  of your desktop background
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  influenced the look of your iOS sounds like.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  It's a thing that happens.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  It works.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  If you have a super orange desktop background,
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  all of your, you know,
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  behind window blending translucent regions
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  are going to have a tinge of orange in them.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Your menu bar is going to be tinged orange.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  All of them and you pull down
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  are going to be tinged orange, right?
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  But, like,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  I didn't, you know,
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  that aspect of personalization.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  Like, it maybe just flies
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  in the face of a traditional or whatever.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Like, if I have a desktop picture
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  that I want,
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  I want my gleaming beautiful
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  to be on top of it.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  I don't want that desktop picture.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Like, I may like it
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  because it's a nice picture.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  I like it.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  But what I don't like
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  is it's contribution
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  to the sidebar
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  of my email client
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  that now looks like a muddy,
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  rusty tinged orange thing
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  whereas before it was crisp text
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  on top of a background color
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  that the app designer had.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Yeah.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  It changes what it means
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  to pick a desktop picture
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  because before it was,
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  okay, what do I want to see
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  when I've got nothing open?
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  Like, I'm done.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Like, let's say,
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  as you complete your,
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  what you have to do today,
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  you keep closing windows
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  and your closing tabs
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  and, you know, you can quit your email
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  because I'm not going to check it again.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  And now I've got nothing
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  and I'm looking at my desktop
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  and this is a picture
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  that makes me happy.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  That's all you had to do
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  when you chose your desktop.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Now you've got to pick something
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  that's going to make,
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  like you said,
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  like make the sidebar
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  in your email client look good
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  when you don't even see the desktop.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And then this is a point
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  I have to put it in ATP terms.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  I have to do some follow up
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  because when Guy was on last
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  week, Guy English
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  and we talked about this,
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  we clearly confused the hell
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  out of a lot of people.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Because we were talking
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  about the way that if you have
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  like a stack of white windows,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  just like text data documents.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  And then you have like
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  mail in front of them.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  And the sidebar of mail
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  behind it is just a white window.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  It still takes a tint
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  from the desktop.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  That's what Guy and I were talking about.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  And that does,
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  in terms of not merely making
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  any kind of logical sense
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  in the world of physics.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  We weren't,
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  what everybody seemed
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  to think we said
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  was that it doesn't take any cues
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  from what's right behind it.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  So it's mostly,
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  it's mostly what's behind this
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  with a touch of the desktop.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  It's mostly what's behind it,
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  directly in the window behind it.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  So if you have like a real vibrant
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  purple image,
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  you know,
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  grimace from McDonald's
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  is in the window behind you.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And your mail is in front of it.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  You're going to have a purple sidebar.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  But I end up a lot of times
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  with a lot of white windows.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  I have editing documents
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  and stuff like that
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  or a mail client or eye chatter.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Yeah.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  But God forbid you have
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  like a Safari window
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  with like a dark black blob
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and then some white stuff
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  and the black blob starts showing.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Right.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  And if it's not like,
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  not like an entirely black window
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  where it just makes the whole thing
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  look great.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  If it's just right in the middle
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  there's looks like there's a smudge.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  I see it in the Messages app
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  every day when I have transparency on
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  because there's,
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  my blue messages are always on the side.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  And so up at the top right
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  blue blur about it ranging
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  from like an inch or two
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  that doesn't extend across the whole bar
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  and it bothers the hell out of me.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Here's the analogy used on
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  an ATP last night
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  which I probably should have also put in
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  their review.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  But didn't.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  So this whole section
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  on extensions.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  And I go through a little bit
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  about the old days
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  of extensions where
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  they would just invade the memory space
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  via the OS
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  or other applications
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  and even into the OS 10 days
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  of just like every app
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  that launches loads
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  of scripting edition
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  which just like runs wild
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  in its memory space
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  and does some crazy hack
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  to enable window shade
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  or whatever it's going to do, right?
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  And the idea
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  that you would write a program
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  is that application developer
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  and then you would test it
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  and debug it
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  and make sure it works correctly
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  and then hand it to somebody
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  and then someone else
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  who you'd never met
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  would write a program
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  that invades your program
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  and changes the way it works
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  and causes a bug in your program
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  and then you get like a support ticket
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  or like, hey,
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  your text editor has a bug
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  and it's like,
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  well no, I totally test that
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  it doesn't.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  Oh, I'm running a extension
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  and this thing written by someone
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  you never met
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  invades your application
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  and changes the way it behaves
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  and now it's buggy.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  You got to fix it.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  It's an untenable way
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  to develop software
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  because how can you,
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  it's like the halting problem?
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  How can I know what's going to happen
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  when some program
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  I've never seen before
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  invades my program
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  and changes the way it's behaved?
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  It's impossible for me
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  to write a quote-unquote
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  correct bug for your program
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  in this environment.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  The designer equivalent of that
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  is I'm going to make an application.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  I'll make it look as good as I want
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  but I have no control
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  over what Windows are behind
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  or what color the person
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  desktop background is.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  I just got to trust Apple
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  to try to make this
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  into something readable
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  and then I get back to the,
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  you know, why?
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  Why is it,
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  what is it about the sidebar?
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Like I can buy,
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  pull down menus,
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I can buy sheets,
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  I can buy,
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  you know,
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  transient things that are floating in
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  but the sidebar seems
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  so a part of the content
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  of the application
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  like maybe if it was a slide
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  out drawer
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  like the old style ones
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  that I could say was transient
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  and maybe it should be translucent
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  but there is nothing
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  about sidebar
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  that says to me,
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  please show me
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  what's behind you.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Like they're filled with text,
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  like they're sourceless.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  They're text that has to be readable.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I do not want to be distracted
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  by the other stuff there.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  And so,
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  I mean,
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  I don't know,
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  there's no option to turn it off
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  except to turn it off everywhere
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  and I pretty much at this point
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  I feel like I'm on board
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  with the way they use translucency
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  even with the stupid
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  tinging and all the drop them.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  I use everywhere except for sidebar
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  because it just seems
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  like a bridge too far.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  The other thing I don't get,
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  I don't get the other use of it.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  I don't get the in window transparency.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  You know, like in Safari
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  where all the chrome
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  is far away.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  There's a little bit more justification
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  that of their own doing
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  as I said,
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  I'm pretty sure I said this in their view.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Once they made scroll bars
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  in visible,
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  the only way you have any indication
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  that there's stuff above or below
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  is if you see something truncated
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  or if you kind of see this dim,
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  you know,
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  wavy image
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  of things that are above or below.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  And that bothers me less
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  because two bars tend to have a stronger boundaries
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  like the two bar buttons themselves
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  don't let stuff show through on them.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  So they're going to be,
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  you know,
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  like dark markings
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  and light backgrounds well defined.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  There's nothing in the toolbar itself
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  that I need to read that's going to become eligible
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  and like just scrolling through the review.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Like you can kind of see the reason they did this
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  and it's one of the justifications of philosophy section
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  is that this looks nice
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  like that it's fashion,
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  that it's aesthetics.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  And if you scroll through my Yosemite review
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  and when I look at some of these screenshots,
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  I think some of them are really pretty.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Like the multiple docs
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  with the different backgrounds
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  or even when I'm trying to show
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  something that I think is a negative,
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  like the same Safari window
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  with I just changed tabs
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  and it radically changes
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  with the entire interface looks like
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  because the pages are half-scrolled up
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  behind the scroll bar.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  That is a little bit crazy,
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  but the image is beautiful.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  I think like this has the most interesting screenshots
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  because of the all, you know,
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  I purposely tried to show things
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  in both the best and the worst light,
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  like get the most aesthetically pleasing
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  but show what the extremes are.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  I think it is a really interesting thing to do
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  but I can only excuse it
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  as long as it doesn't start impinging
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  on usability.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  When it doesn't pin jump and usability,
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  but I have a good reason other than
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  in some scenarios it looks really good.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  I know in your scenario it's ugly
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  and you can't turn it off
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  but in some scenarios it looks good.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  And that still bothers me.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Well, and I guess I like the in-window transparency
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  a little bit more than the behind-window transparency
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  because there's a little bit more,
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  like you said, with the scrolling
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  and a sense of, hey, there's stuff up there.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  There's some kind of logic to it.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Whereas the sidebar transparency
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  just seems mindless to me.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  So I think, and I've been,
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  as I've gone full-time Yosemite,
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I think I'm probably going to run
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  with the reduced transparency option in that.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Yeah, and that bothers me
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  because I think, I mean it does,
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  as I pointed out in the review,
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  it does look okay like that.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  It still looks handsome.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  It shows that this is a sturdy design
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  that does not rely on transparency
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  parallatrix to look nice
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  because it looks perfectly nice
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  and it's solid, especially on retiniscreens,
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  with sort of fine hair lines about things that contrast
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  is still a little bit low,
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  but otherwise it shows that there's, you know,
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  there are sturdy bones underneath this design.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  But it's a shame to give up all the transparency effects
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  that I like just to save that one that I don't look.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  And the other thing that bothers me
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  about reduced transparency is
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  those are in the accessibility preference pane.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  And those things are there
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  to help make the interface more usable
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  for people who need that.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  But I feel like designers are not sweating
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  as much over what things look like
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  turned on, both third party and Apple design.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  That it looks clunkier.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  That it looks more like in the way
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  the windows is like, wow, we'll just do this
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  and I'm sure it'll look fine
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  and you look at it and there's like details in our right.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  They're sweating over what it looks like
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  in the default mode.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  I don't think people are sweating
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  over how any application looks
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  with reduced transparency on.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Right down to the overlays for volume changing
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  where the little corners don't have transparency
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  in some situations, have you seen that?
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  I don't think so.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  Let me see.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  I should not have told you about it because,
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  so now can you leave that option on?
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  It's totally counter to the super Apple nerd
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  aesthetic.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Everything has to be beautiful and elegant.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Stuff like that is around if you know where to look for it.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  That's hard.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Because accessibility is not meant to be like,
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  it's first and foremost is supposed to make it more usable
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  at the expense of perfect aesthetic beauty.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  There is one of your expenses.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  Maybe you'll think more about that option.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Yeah.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  So when you change the volume and you get that,
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  what is that, like a HUD?
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  What would you call it?
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  The temporary?
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Oh, the rounded corners are just filled in with black.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  That's terrible.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Because it's a transparent part of whatever that thing is.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  I've got to call that.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  I bet that's a bug that they'll fix, but it's a definite sign.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  But that type of thing, like if you were to file that as a bug,
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  hey, when I enable the accessibility option,
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  this thing doesn't look as nice.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  They're going to be like, yeah, but it's more,
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  it's easier to see, right?
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Stuff doesn't show through, right?
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  That's the point of the accessibility feature.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  So feel free to file that bug,
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  see if the closet is behaves correctly.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  I will.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  I will.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Like you said, I would love to be able to pick and choose
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  and just turn it off on the side bars.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  Because I like the transparency on the menus.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  I think it makes, it looks good.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  And it makes sense to me that it's temporary.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  It's just a little thing that while I choose this menu command,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  it's floating over my thing.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  And now that they're solid,
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  I just checked it right here in front of me.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  It doesn't look as nice.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Yeah, the text rendering changes,
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  especially on non-read and other text rendering changes
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  when you go solid on the menus as well.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  And the menus, the thing that bothers me about the menus
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  is the change of the desktop.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  Like I like the overlays, like the volume change
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  or when transparency is on, the sort of iOS 7 overlay
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  when you pull up control center from the,
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  but like it doesn't bring,
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  it doesn't pull any colors from your desktop background.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  It's just simply I am white slightly translucent
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  with that cool blur effect.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  I wish the menus were like that
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  because all of my desktop pictures are making,
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  I pull them and use ugly or like,
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  I'm going to have to change them.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  Even though I love the pictures that are there,
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  just to pick one that has a different dominant color
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  so the dominant color, I can, you know,
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  stomach the side of and all of my pull down menus.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  Did you turn on increased contrast?
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  Do you play with that?
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  I haven't used it like that.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  I obviously had turned it on for screen shots and stuff.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  I feel like that one,
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  I know what you're saying that it looks like System 6,
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  but it looks like System 6 made by someone
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  with not a lot of attention to detail as things collide
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  with each other
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  and there's no spaces between things
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  because they just sort of draw with a magic marker
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  over the edges
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  and don't read,
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  they don't change the metrics.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  So it's like crowded too.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  There's a whole bunch of things that I think look better
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  and a whole bunch of things that clearly look worse
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  just in terms of whether it's pleasing to me
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  and I realize like you said,
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  this is, it is under accessibility for a reason.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  I can actually see clearly how it is
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  an accessibility feature for some people
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  but I actually like some of the details of it
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  but there's others that, you know, I can't,
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  I just know I could rock it full time.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  And the low contrast that like,
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  it's basically the default
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  where everything is super low contrast
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  in that room on you, speaking of IE5,
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  like the days when we were all using Bitmap fonts
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  and everything was like, well, you're still doing it.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Like a light gray text on a dark gray background
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  and, you know, in 10 point verdana pixel fonts
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  and everything was super low
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  and you could just make it so precious and beautiful
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  but then when you move back from the screen
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  it just faded into a uniform gray haze
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  and you don't notice it so much in your somebody
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  until you turn on increased contrast
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  you're like, whoa, this hairline's now jumped out at me
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  and now there's clear delineations
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  and like the toolbar buttons don't fade into the toolbar
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  as much as they used to, like,
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  it goes too far on the other direction
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  but you only notice the low contrast of your somebody
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  when you turn on the high grind
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  and then turn it back off and you're like, whoa,
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  I feel like I just, my night vision went out
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  and now everything's fading into one big blur again.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  One of the things that most surprised me about your somebody
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  when they unveiled it at WWDC
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  was that the general control,
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  I call it a control panel, system press panel
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  where you control the basic appearance stuff,
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  graphite and blue, highlight color and stuff like that
[1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  my gut feeling was that they were going to get rid of all that
[1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  just as, you know, go more like iOS
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  like you don't get to pick a highlight color in iOS
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  you're going to get blue and you're going to like it
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  or the app is going to override it
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  you don't get to pick whether you get blue or gray
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  as a highlight color
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  you don't get to pick the color that get, you know,
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  when you select text what color is the highlight of the text
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  that's the other thing about increased contrast
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  it changes your highlight color too
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  to something that I seemingly can't quite figure out
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  how what the rules are for.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  I thought they were going to get rid of all that
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  because I thought that was sort of, that's such an old-school
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  consumer, you know,
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  feature, you know, that you get like the way windows
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  you still let you pick everything, you know,
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  you can totally design, you know, blue with white trim
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  or, you know, you could make windows look just truly
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  got awful but they'd let you do it.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  But the thing they have in there, the things they have in there
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  are there for reasons that haven't changed
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  like the whole reason graphite is there
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  is because like they're essentially bowing to pressure
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  from graphic designers who felt like the candy color
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  is worth throwing off their color sense
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  and they, you know, as I think I pointed out in other review
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  such a multi-year big FU to all those designers who were like
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  you've got to get these candy color
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  to aqua widgets out of our face, it's totally destroying my ability
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  to, you know, these colors look different
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  than the next to other colors.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  I need something that's neutral or whatever.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  So Apple said fine, here's graphite and they give,
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  they made everything a blue tinge to gray.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  Which was, it was just worse.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  I feel like for throwing off color balance
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  because if your mind believes that it's actually neutral gray
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  but it's not, there's more blue in it.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  It's going to screw you up way worse
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  than primary color is red, green, and yellow.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  But anyway, now the gray is more interesting.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  I loved it though.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  It was almost as though they let me pick like a blue tinted
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  where hey, it was like right down my alley.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  Yeah, no, but like it's, it doesn't,
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  it's not really what they asked for.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And so now with graphite is now, now much more neutral gray
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  and it's totally boring, but for people who want something
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  that's neutral, it's fine.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  But like, no, they went in the other direction.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  Like they said, okay, we've got blue and graphite
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  and also by the way, you can do this crazy dark mode
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  that we sort of half-heartedly did to match our pro apps.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  Like again, you know, that I asked about that
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  and they're like, again, a bunch of different reasons for it
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  but like the one that has the most weight is like pro customers
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  wanted this to match the pro applications
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  that are also dark because they're like they're looking
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  at video day and they don't want the white menu bar
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  and dock staring them in the face.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  So here's a dark mode.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  But I thought as, and you, you must have stayed up to date
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  with the betas over the summer.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  I thought that they actually called it a dark mode
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  and it seemed like a hint like when they unveiled it
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  on stage at WWDC that it would be almost like everything.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  Windows that all sorts of stuff was going to go dark.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Well, so there's a couple of reasons why they didn't do that.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Like early on in the betas in the general control panel thing.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  Like the same control was there, but instead of being a checkbox,
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  it was a theme pop-up menu.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  So it was like, I forget what the words were.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Like whatever word is next to the graphite aqua picker
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  and then there was another picker that it was a pop-up menu
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  of like theme and it was like regular in dark.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  And that became a checkmark which is kind of the demotes it
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  like, oh, this is not theming.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  This is not OS theming.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  This is just a checkmark option that tweaks how certain things look.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  And you can't go full dark.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  I think the same reason even just making the menu bar dark
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  was a problem because now you have all these third party
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  and Apple's own in the beginning.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Menu bar icons that draw incorrectly.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Because they draw black on top of black
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  and you couldn't see anything.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  And Apple's own had to be updated
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  and the third party ones had to be updated.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  Multiply that problem by about a bazillion
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  if you tried to change the entire interface to dark.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  The only application is draw with black
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  and if you put them on a black background
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  everything's invisible.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  So that was just not going to happen.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Like the appearance manager in those days
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  you had ways to, you know,
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  if everyone was using the appearance manager
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  you could make sure that your app looked good
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  at an any possible crazy kaleidoscope.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Right.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  Because you didn't, if you embraced the appearance manager
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  you never picked, you never said draw black text.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Yeah.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  You said draw is drew with like a theme brush
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  or whatever the idea was.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Right.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  You would say give me the text color
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  and now draw in text color.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  And you didn't have to know what text color was
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  and now you see a lot, you know, there's clearly
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  a lot of apps that like.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Yeah.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  And main cocoa was like,
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  cocoa was not made with that in mind.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  And you know,
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  I certainly even jobs came back.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  The theme stuff was canned,
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  even though the APIs were still there.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  And so like, you know,
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  as I talked about,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  there was this brief period
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  where it was explosion of them on the Mac community
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  but like even though that tech was there
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  and people took advantage of it,
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  jobs was against it pretty much closed the door on that.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  And now you have an ecosystem of applications
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  that are not prepared to be on a system
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  where the system looked changes in radical ways.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  I mean, it's hard enough for Apple
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  to change the look to make sure like, you know,
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  if you drew a custom control,
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  now it looks wrong and everything.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And there's all sorts of other,
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  I don't know,
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  even though that they've cut it down
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  and it's just used dark menu bar and dock.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  It's like the selection color,
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  the highlight color for the menus
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  in the dark mode,
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  it's not right to me.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  Yeah, that's another, you know,
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  vibrancy attempt because it's got 10 tinge
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  with the desktop background
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  but also like, you know,
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  sort of inverted type thing.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  It's weird and sometimes it looks a little,
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  you know, it looks a little sickly sometimes.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  It doesn't, you know, it doesn't,
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  it doesn't have the pizzazz of like,
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  the big theme in the regular,
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  the regular look is this very light gray lighter than normal
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  not a lot of gradient to it
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  and this really powerful kind of like,
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  it's like,
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  if Pepto business was blue instead of pink
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  that's what the blue looks like.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  Right.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  It's like really like chalky thick opaque blue
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  and that's your highlight color.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  Whereas when you go dark mode,
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  it just kind of becomes this like pale moonlight
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  that's shining on your selected element.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  It does not make us powerful a statement.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  Yeah, and it doesn't even invert the color of the text.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  So, I mean, and you're seeing that
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  because you're running in graphite mode.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  That's what we're talking about here
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  in case people are confused.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  If you run in non,
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  change your thing from non graphite
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  and change the dark mode and then pull down a menu,
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  it looks much more, it looks much stronger than that.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Yeah, it looks horrible in graphite mode.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  It looks okay in blue mode,
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  it still doesn't change the color of the text though.
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  Like in regular mode,
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  when you have like you hover your mouse
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  over the new, you know, file new,
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  then new goes from being written
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  and black to being written in white
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  because the blue is so vibrant.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  But in the dark mode,
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  they don't change to like,
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  they don't invert the text.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  It's just,
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  it's too close.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  It's not clear that the background is so different
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  that you know you have to invert like it's too.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  And then, I mean,
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  that's that's all thing with the vibrancy.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  If I could like,
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  I had WWC like they would show that,
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  hey, if you draw text with like,
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  again, the text color thing drawn on a vibrant background,
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  we will adjust the color of the text
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  to make sure that every part of the text
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  has enough contrast to be readable.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  And so the text color changes
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  because like behind,
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  what you can see behind the vibrant background
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  is whatever the hell is behind it,
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  whether it's a window or a desktop background.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  So you can't just pick one text color.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  You have to sort of adjust the text color
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  as you go along, in sync with the,
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  whatever is behind it to make sure
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  that this letter on the right side of this sentence
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  is a totally different color than this lever on the left side
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  because the thing that's behind it is different.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  And they're trying to finesse that.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  And again, I have to ask,
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  why what's the point?
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Text is supposed to be readable.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Just put it on a background
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  where you could where the developer of the application
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  you can control the foreground on the background color.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  And we can all read the friggin' text.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  I don't need to see what's behind it.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  Why?
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  I'm surprised, I'm still a little surprised
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  that they even have all these options,
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  that they didn't just say, you know,
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  it's our way or the highway,
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  and you're gonna get blue and you're gonna like it.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Yeah, so it took us from 10.0 to 10.5
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  for them to just like brush metal is gone,
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  pinstripes are gone, there's one window style,
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  the buttons look normal,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  nothing is too transparent, the menus,
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  I mean, I remember the transparency of pull down menus
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  was so extreme in the beginning,
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  and then by the end, like by a leopard
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  and snow leopard timeframe,
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  it was practically opaque.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  It's like, why even bother with that point?
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  Like, I can't see anything through this.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  It's almost entirely opaque white, right?
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  So, you know, in 10.15,
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  expect all this exuberance to have consolidated
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  into one more conservative,
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  yet still recognizably Yosemite-ish look.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Yeah, and there's a couple of things they get right.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  I think the new dock is great,
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  and I call that out.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  Here's what you wrote in your review.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  Setting aside the particulars,
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  the Yosemite dock exudes a visual confidence
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  that has been sorely missed in the last few releases of OS X.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  Like, to me, the dock exemplifies
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  what Yosemite is shooting for.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Yeah, and as I said, it's the ideal scenario
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  for you to show off vibrancy,
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  because the icons are so like,
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  you're not gonna lose them.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  No matter what crazy crap is going on with the background,
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  and we show the screenshot of like,
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  it's looking how green it looks here.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Look at how blue it looks here.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  The icon stands so proud of that interface.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  They're not gonna get lost.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  You're not trying to read a bunch of text.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  And you have full freedom on that background
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  where otherwise no information would be conveyed
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  to show off, hey, this cool effect that we've done,
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  this vibrancy thing where we blur
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  and pull forward different colors and saturate it.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  It looks beautiful, it's interesting.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  And, you know, it conveys this,
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  this is kind of a piece of glass or translucent thing
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  laying over stuff like,
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  that is the ideal environment for this type of effect.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Because it doesn't impair anything at all.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  And even like the parts where you hover
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  and you get the text,
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  those that gave dedicated backgrounds that say,
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  okay, well, now it's time for you to read text.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  I'm not gonna mess around here.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  I'm going to give you what is almost,
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  you know, a fairly opaque light colored background
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  with dark, you know, text on top of it
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  or the reverse in dark mode.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  To make sure you can read the text
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  for the hovers and everything like that,
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  but dark itself will just be like,
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  we finally figured it out.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  No more ridges.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  No more weird frills.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  No down on an angle and shiny things on it.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  No reflections of the windows that are going above it.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Like, yeah, it's been a long road for the dark.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  I think the Maverick stock is probably the best 3D dock
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  because it kind of like that, that, you know,
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  not brush metal.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  I mean something else in the parlance of the Mac,
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  but like sort of a matte finish metal type of thing.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  The 3D effect still just does not work
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  and should never have been done,
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  but that one at least has the most class.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  But I was like, we're done with that phase.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  Here's what the dock looks like.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  It looks the same vertical and horizontal.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  This is the dock.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  They even got rid of pinning,
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  which is kind of a shame,
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  but that was never a document to feature anyway.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  What was pinning top and bottom?
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Yeah, instead of having the dock centered on the edge of the screen,
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  people love to pin it to the top or the bottom.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  I suspect that maybe one thing that they reverse on
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  if they get a lot of complaints about it
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  because even though it wasn't documented,
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  the people who have been doing it have been doing it
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  since like, you know, whatever the undocumented feature was added,
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  whatever developer preview,
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  you could say it's undocumented,
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  but once you've been doing it for, you know,
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  it was like 10, 15 years.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  It was like a default's right thing.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Yeah, you didn't have to hack it.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  You just give it a preference.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  It was, you know, a preference that you'd just
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  put in an terminal and then it would take it.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  I remember that.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  Come that apple.doc pinning starter end or whatever it was.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  What's that app from the guy in Germany that's just,
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  it's just like a front end to all the hidden preferences?
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  I like secrets,
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  which is from the guy who made Quicksilver.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  Oh, right, yeah.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  Internet share database of those type of things,
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  but there's a million applications that will, you know,
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  either show you what those commands are or run them for it.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  Right.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  I think, and again,
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  I shouldn't say it's underplayed,
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  because I think it's obvious,
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  but that this interface is so clearly designed,
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  designed retina first,
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  and how it looks on non retina max is, you know,
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  will make the best of it,
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  but it's so clearly a retina first design.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And I guess I should have,
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  if it should have been a sign, like when we saw it at WWDC,
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  it should have been a sign that retina,
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  like this would be the year we're going to get retin eye max,
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  because I don't think it's a coincidence that they're debuting
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  at the same time as it interface that so clearly is,
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  is meant to be seen on a retina display.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  But even if we weren't getting a retina desktop max this year,
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  they still have to design of a retina,
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  like you have to be forward looking.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  There's no sense in making a brand new look for the Mac at this point in time,
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  even if retina weren't going to be out for two years,
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  you just have to, you just have to say, like,
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  you have to be forward looking about this,
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  like which is why I hope to God whatever new file system at bowl,
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  must surely be working on is made entirely with SSDs in mind,
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  like screw spinning disks.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  I know there's still a round,
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  I know people are going to use them for years,
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  but if you're doing something now,
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  you have to be forward looking.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  Yeah, that's a good point that it would make sense.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  It maybe even make it so that it doesn't even run on non SSDs,
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  and you know, it's still use HFS plus till the end of time on your spinning hard disks.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  Don't smoke them, it just wants to really summon.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I think that the choice of Helvetica,
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  or as they say, Helvetica Noya, in particular,
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  is the clearest sign that it's meant to be seen on retina first,
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  because as I look at Yosemite on a non retina MacBook Air,
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  it's the type that really annoys.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  Yeah, people are upset that I didn't make more of that in my review,
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  and the reason I didn't make more of it is,
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  because I truly believe most people will not even notice.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  I know that is inconceivable to those of us who were like type nerds,
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  and I'm not even that big of a type nerd,
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  but it bothers me because I have non retina Macs,
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  and it's just not like...
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  And you might have non retina Macs for a while.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  Right, but even...
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  I'm not as bothered by it as you are in as many as people are,
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  but I truly think regular people will just absolutely not notice the texture.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  Even if you put it side by side,
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  because people are just not sensitive to that,
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  maybe if you had changed from brush script to Cairo,
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  people would notice people just do not notice
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  that you change from one sensor or font to another.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  Right.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  So I can notice that I noticed that it's not really
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Helvetica Noya, it's a system fun.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  I still haven't found where it lives.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  It must be somewhere in slash system library.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  It used to be available in the font menu
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  in the early betas when they took it out of there,
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  but yeah, it's hiding in there.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  It's the mutant one not for any reason that like makes sense
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.400]  from like, well, we wanted to make a readable system
[2:13:59.400 --> 2:14:01.000]  because they had to make the metrics match.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  So it's kind of perverted by the need to match metrics.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  So I think it's basically uglier than it needs to be.
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  So it's the same with or closest possible.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  Yeah, I think that's exactly it.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  Well, and it works a little better,
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  and it's a little bit of a concession,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  or not even a little bit.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  I actually know that they spent an awful lot of time.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  Once they decide, okay, we're going to go to Helvetica.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  And we still got all of these non retina max
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  that we're going to support for years to come.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  And in some cases, they might even be selling for years to come.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Who knows when the Mac Pro is going to be able to support Apple branded retina displays?
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  Macbook Air Rumors say it's going to go retina soonish,
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  but it's got to support non retina for a long time.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  They spend a lot of time tweaking the metrics,
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  not just to make it match loose it up,
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  but also to make sure that it at the sizes that it's used as a system font
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  that it hits the pixel boundaries as often as possible.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  Yeah, because otherwise you get L.O. and hello
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  becomes just one big, interesting blur.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  It looks like a really thick capitol eye or something.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  Right.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  And my favorite example,
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  so there's a lot of apps.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  It's a standard menu and cocoa, the format menu.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  In the menu bar, if you look, at least on a retina display,
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  I don't know, I don't have a Yosemite non retina,
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  but on the retina display, at least the R and the M,
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  there's clearly some space between them.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  Whereas if you just open a text edit document,
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  set the font to a Helvetica Noya, it's like 16,
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  or it's 18, or whatever it is,
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  and type the word format.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  The R and the M are going to touch,
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  and it's going to look, you know,
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  unless you know, you know, it's just one of those,
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  you just have to know the word.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  You can't tell which ones the M and with, you know.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  It just all looks like a bunch of humps next to each other.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  Yeah, it's not a ligature, you don't think.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  It's just the kernel.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Right.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  The default kernel for Helvetica Noya is tight enough
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  that the word format at that size is the R and the M
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  are going to blur together, which is one of those things
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  that people who don't like Helvetica don't like about Helvetica.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  What else?
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  Like the word window even is sort of,
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  it turns differently if you use real Helvetica Noya,
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  you know, the way that the slantiness of the W,
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  you know, has space next to it with the eye,
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  that the eye isn't going to get lost in the W.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  It's very thoughtful.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  It makes me wonder why they don't use that.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  I guess it's because of the metrics.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  Why, like on iOS, they just use Helvetica Noya.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  There's no special version of it for the system font to my knowledge.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Yeah, and the iOS line has, again,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  with the exception of the, the zombie iPad.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Many, the iOS line has been in red and longer
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  and it's more of a comfortable type of thing.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  And, you know, again, forward looking, like,
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  we're going to make these devices.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  They're all going to be red and as soon enough
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  because the screens are small enough.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  We know we can do it design and interface,
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  especially iOS, like design and interface that is,
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  that's, that's aimed at a world where all the devices are red
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  because they're going to be that way really soon.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  Yeah.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  One of your, I will finish with a little bit of Swift
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  and then we'll call it a show because it's been a long time.
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  But, I, I, from your review, from my notes review
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  on page 16, you wrote,
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  among a certain set of Mac enthusiasts,
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  it was a point of pride to have many rows of icons
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  filling the startup screen.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Now, that's a reference to the classic Mac OS,
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  where, you know, like when you,
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  the whole section where you're talking about old style
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  extensions that just ran into memory space of every app
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  or in the system space, you know, just system-wide.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  It was all the same.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  There was no system.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  It was just one pull of memory.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  It was one giant memory region carved up into pieces
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  where you're supposed to stay in your little section.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  Right.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  And it made me laugh because I remember thinking about that,
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  that like when I first started becoming a Mac nerd,
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  it was absolutely a point of pride to have as many of those as possible.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  But there, there was like a, if you kept going
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  and became more informed and a little bit more mature,
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  it started becoming, at the highest levels,
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  it became more of a point of pride to have as few of those things as possible.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  Well, the pride in having a lot of them wasn't so much
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  that your machine was so tricked out,
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  but that you had figured out the correct load order
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  and incompatibilities that you would actually run this many
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  and they all worked.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  Because there was always like,
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  you got to load this first and this has to be there
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  and these two are totally incompatible
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  because you enable this one, you have to disable these two.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  But this one, you can still keep as long as you move it
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  after that, like it's more conflict catcher was made for.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  Like, that not only that you, that you had all this software
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  in store, but that you had figured out how to make it
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  into a stable system and then, yeah,
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  eventually you stop, you get sick of spending your time playing
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  with conflict catcher.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  You're like, do I really need a dopey type manager?
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  Do I really, really need it?
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  How many fonts do I actually have?
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  And like, you know, something's got to go
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  and a dopey type manager is big.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  So, ATM goes out the door, but you know...
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  See, I always had to run ATM because I was doing,
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  I was doing design work.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  But ATM was a good example where,
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  what was the character?
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  We had everybody.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  I mean, it shipped from Adobe with, like,
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  I think the Tilda character in front,
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  like the extensions.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  Tilda ATM, because on the old Mac OS,
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  Tilda sorted alphabetically first,
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  because it had to load first.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  Or was it last?
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  For example, remember?
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  But, yeah, but that was the, you know,
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  that and putting funny characters in front of things
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  in your Apple menu folder.
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  Apple menu item is sold there to make.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  Right.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  It's based on stuff like that.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  Yeah, but that was a very different world.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  But that, if you live through that,
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  you understand, like, the whole thing with extensions
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  is, for iOS, it makes sense.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  Like, iOS is so buttoned down the whole time, right?
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  And we were all, like, we want ways to extend the system,
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  like, you know, keyboards or, like, having share panels
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  include our stuff in it.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  All these things is, like,
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  come on, we need a way to do this.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  So it made a way to do it for iOS, right?
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  But on the Mac, even in an OS X,
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  we didn't have these memory patching extensions,
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  but we had, you know, we had all sorts of people
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  that found ways to do things,
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  symbol extensions or the mock inject to get your code in there.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  Like, it's not like the Mac needed extensions.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  It's always 10 has extensions.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  And but the reason that Apple said,
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  we're going to make this extension system for iOS.
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  It's going to be safe and sandboxing all the, you know,
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  things that we're doing.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  We're also going to do it for the Mac
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  because this is part of the unification of the platform.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Why should we not have this in Mac?
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  And you can't, these use can't be,
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  well, the Mac's already got ways to extend it.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Yeah, it's a crappier way, and it's kind of dangerous,
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  but we don't need to bother with that.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Not many people lie Macs anyway.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  The new Apple is, if we have an awesome way
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  to make extensions, we're going to deploy it everywhere.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  The Mac's going to get the iOS is going to get it.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  If there's a way to do it on the watch,
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  that's going to get it too.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  And that's, that's a different philosophy.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  And like, if you live through the bed all days
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  of these little rows of icons,
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  you understand deepening your bones,
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  what is wrong with letting other people
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  software enter your memory space
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  and screw with your applications.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  And so any type of extension missing is
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  that avoids all those evils.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Yes, please bring it to the Mac.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  Not because we can't get, you know, extensions now.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  Like we have all these weird extensions
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  that can do weird things to your Mac, even in OS 10.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  We just want better ones.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  We don't, we don't want,
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  we never want to be close to recreating
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  that bad old world of those, those rows of icons.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Yeah, we want the feature and it's,
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  but we don't, if you're technically informed at all,
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  you don't hunt the, the, the buggy ramifications.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  Yeah, I backed off like I, I used a lot more memory
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  patching extensions the early days of OS 10.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  A lot of it.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  So, you know, backfill functionality
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  that wasn't in the OS itself.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  And I've just slowly paired those things down.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  Like I ran an application extension,
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  enhanced our APE from the insanity guys.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  I ran that for years and years,
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  but then at a certain point it was like enough is enough.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  I'm only using it for one or two things.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  I can live without them.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  Like window shape is the last one to go,
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  because I really, really loved that.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  And I wish I could get it back now,
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  but cleaning hooks into the OS with real APIs
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  that don't involve invading the memory space
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  of another process.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  That's what we've always wanted the whole time
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  and now Apple is finally providing that.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  So, I hope every, every existing Apple mechanism
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  is there still ones, Apple supported ones,
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  of like, you know, text input methods
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  and all sorts of other things that actually will load.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  You put something in a special folder.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  You launch your application.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  And the, the cocoa frameworks will look
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  in that folder for your thing
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  and load it into the application
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  and you're supposed to be well behaved
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  and not do anything nasty.
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  And, you know, but like.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  Not supposed to implement something
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  that changes what happens when you double click
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  at the top of any window.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Yeah, but like once you're in there,
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  like that's why, you know,
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  scripting additions were like a gateway
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  into the thing or the symbol extension.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  You know, we have all those things
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  but some of them are officially out,
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  even like the menu bar icons.
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  I, I, someone was trying to crack me
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  and it's been, I'm pretty sure
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  someone can send it a correction
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  to you if I'm wrong about this.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  That if you write a badly behaved menu bar,
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  you know, icon type thing,
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  you can crash system UI server
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  because you're kind of in the mix there.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  Maybe, maybe that's not the case now.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  If you use any set of bar instead of the
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  and a status item instead of the menu
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  extra thing that's supposed to be undocumented.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  But anyway, there's still lots of officially supported Apple
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  things where you can get your code
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  into someone else's memory space
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  and all those mechanisms.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  I would like them to make a officially supported,
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  you know, separate process extension mechanism
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  like all the, you know, the ones that are in Yosemite
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  because I like all that functionality.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  I'll like it even better if you can make it safer
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  so that badly behaved extension can't crash my app.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  Yeah.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  The part of your review that I thought
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  I was a little surprised that you spent as much space
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  on it was swift.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  And after reading it, it made all the sense in the world
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  and I thought it was really, really good.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  I thought it was, you know,
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  but that's why I like your reviews.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  You're always surprised me it was something
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  because I didn't anticipate you writing that much
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  about Swift because I didn't see Swift as a Yosemite feature.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  I just saw it as something that coincidentally
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  was a 2014 thing that Apple did.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  And, you know, iOS 8 and Yosemite
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  just happened to be the first new OS's that, you know,
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  that you can write apps for with it.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  That's like, I was mentioning on ATP,
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  like I found myself at WRC sitting in metal sessions
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  and taking notes.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  What am I doing?
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  This isn't an OS 10 technology.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  Metal is for iOS only.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  Why am I even about it?
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  But it's because I was starting to view everything
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  that Apple did, not as like,
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  oh, this is a Mac technology.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  This is an iOS technology.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  These are Apple's platform technologies
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  and even though metal isn't on the Mac now,
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  there's no reason it couldn't be in the future.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  And even though Swift is not specific to OS 10,
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  it's just as applicable to OS 10 as it is to iOS, right?
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  I mean, the other reason, of course,
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  I made such a big section out of this is two reasons.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  One, there's always something that I put in the review
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  that I know almost nobody cares about,
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  but that I write a whole big,
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  like disproportionate amount about it.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  Maybe not as much as Swift,
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  but like, you know, I write a whole section
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  on launch D at one point.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  No one, no one freaking cares about launch D,
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  except for me.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  So, you know, like that, it was interesting to me
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  and I was like, I give myself that, right?
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  And the second thing is because I have a personal history
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  with like the whole clamoring for a new language
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  and everything and I was gonna have my say
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  to do it in my OS 10 review and people can just deal with it.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  I think your take is interesting
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  and it's the reaction that people at large have had
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  to Swift is curious to me because I see an awful,
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  ever since WWDC and continuing until now,
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  I see an awful lot of criticism from developers
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  about Swift that to me just seems uncalled for.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  Like, it's the first version.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  They just came out with it.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  It's going to get better, like all programming languages do.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  Like, the thing is though, is that they're showing it
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  to us by Apple standards extraordinarily early
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  and letting us, letting our, here's what we're thinking,
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  here's our idea for the next generation language
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  for writing apps for our platforms in a very early stage
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  and then they've already incorporated
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  a slew of feedback from the outside.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  It's, to me in a broad sense,
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  exactly what a lot of us have been hoping to see from Apple,
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  not just regarding developer tools,
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  but just Apple in general of don't be,
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  and you've written about this numerous times,
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  like don't just take seven smart people
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  and put them aside and let them work for five years
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  and come out with a thing because no matter how smart they are
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  and how talented they are, they're going to have their own
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  personal idiosyncrasies are going to lead them
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  to overlook certain things that they wouldn't
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  if it was exposed to the world at large,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  but now they've finished it and they've given it to us
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  and here it is, right?
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Like if they had been working on Swift for another two years
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  and then came out with it but said this is it, it's final,
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  it wouldn't have incorporated all sorts of things
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  that they're incorporating.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  But they're getting, they're getting flak for it,
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  like the fact that it's changed so much
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  just since WWDC.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  Well, I think you've kind of made their argument for them
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  in some respects.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  So this two parts of this one is that a lot of things
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  about Swift are fundamental to the philosophy and body
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  by language, mostly having to do with how method calls
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  are bound.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  What implementation happens when I call this method,
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  or basically a method calls instead of message passing
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  or whatever?
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  Philosophically, late binding versus early binding
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  and Swift is, wants to have everything
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  statically figured out.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  It needs to know what code, what code, you type something
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  here, it looks like a function call.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  What implementation does that actually run?
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  Swift wants to know a compile time object to see
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  if it's runtime is like, oh, it's all dynamic dispatch.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  I can figure out what it is.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  You can do method swizzling.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  You can form method names out of strings and call them.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  That philosophical divide is not something
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  that's going to be changed with the tweak to the language.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Even though Swift can use the object to see runtime
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  as you, if you sub-classical thanus object
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and those other stuff, anyway, that philosophical divide,
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  dynamic versus static, that's just an honest difference
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  between people who like that aspect of object of C
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  and the people who design Swift who are saying
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  that type of dynamic aspect makes whole classes
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  of optimization impossible for us because we can't see
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  through the call boundary to understand how we can optimize
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  across that call because we don't even know
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  what the hell it's going to call.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  That's a philosophical difference.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  No amount tweaking is going to change that.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  The second thing is the idea that they're putting it
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  out early and doing these tweaks to the minor details
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  and stuff like that, the complaint against that
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  possibly by different people, which is why Apple
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  really can't win here because you're not going to
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  place everybody is that, hey, Swift is great and all,
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  but they think that it was basically,
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  these guys went off and seven smart guys came out
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  with this thing, we really would have loved it
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  if you had built a major application with this language first
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  and then presented it to us.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  If you had dog food did it longer
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  because if you had dog food,
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  you would have found all the same exact things we're finding
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  and how many times did they tweaked how it interacts
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  with core foundation and object of C APIs,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  the various idioms of how, because they didn't
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  write all new frameworks, they need this language to work
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  with their existing frameworks and it's not quite
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  an exact match, so they have to come up with conventions
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  for like when you call out of these things,
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  we're going to do this and we're like, all these different
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  conventions of how to handle in-out error parameters
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  and mapping between optionals which exist in Swift and like
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  nil and, you know, if there's no optionals like that
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  in Objective C and how do we cross those boundaries?
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  If they had used Swift to write a major application,
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  that, so the argument goes,
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  they would have figured a lot of stuff out on their own.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  Instead of bringing it out to a so early,
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  it seems like this was kept to really private
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  to a small group of people and now you're throwing it
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  on top of us and we're like, oh, it's not ready.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  Now, that's kind of self-contradative because like,
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  what do you want? Do you want to see it early?
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  Or do you want it to be done?
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  Or you don't, you want it to have feedback,
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  but, you know, different people want different things.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  It's not like a single person is trying to ask
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  Apple to do things that are completely contradictory.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  It's different groups of people want different things
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  that are out of Apple.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  So, yeah, I mean, I think of that too.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  I think of what Objective C looked like in 1989
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  or whatever, and what Objective C looks like now.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  And the pace of development of Objective C
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  has accelerated so much in the past few years
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  that I'm willing to give Swift a lot of leeway
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  to get things right, but philosophically speaking,
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  if you have a disagreement like, you know,
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  the dynamic dispassionate or everything like that,
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  that I don't see, you know,
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  that's just going to have to be in a disagreement
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  because I don't think that's going to change that much.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  You know, because it's like the idea is like,
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  is it dynamic by default and like a tie it down
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  or is it static by default and you can make it dynamic?
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  And Swift is very much in the camp of static by default
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  and you have the ability to make certain things dynamic
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  and other people like, no, no, you've got the defaults wrong
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  it should be the other way, but it's coming from different places.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  Yeah, reading your review and what you had to say about Swift
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  and I love it.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  To me, it's the right way to have about this.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  Like, you even admit that there's aspects of the language
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  that you as a programmer aren't your liking.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  You're not, you don't like having, you know, the static type
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  static type typing.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  But you don't, you don't take that as therefore it's bad,
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  right?
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  Statically type language is bad.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  It is a perfect, you know, that's so much of the internet
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  is not being able to acknowledge,
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  okay, I disagree with that, I dislike that,
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  but that I can acknowledge that that is a valid,
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  a valid philosophy to have.
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  And especially since they stated their goals, like I said,
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  this is the type of language we want to make
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  and you can evaluate Swift and how well is it achieved
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  their own stated goals.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:00.000]  And then you can also like, like I said,
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  a lot of the arguments against Swift is like,
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  maybe you disagree with the goals.
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:05.000]  Then fine, then what you could say is you should never have tried
[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  to make a language that is convened as a scripting language
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:10.000]  that you could write whole S's in it
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  because you make a crappy, like a jack of all trades master
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  feel free to argue with the premises and the mission statement
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  that is a separate argument which you can have from,
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  if I accept this mission statement,
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  you know, how well does Swift fulfill that mission
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  and what were the, how did it do it?
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:28.000]  Like that's the most interesting thing to me
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  because I think the mission is incredibly ambitious.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  Like I said, it's a totally an Apple move.
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  Like it is very gutsy and very ambitious and not,
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  because it's not doing whatever,
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  seemingly who's complaining about what it was like,
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  just make me a better nicer objective see.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  That's all I want.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  Don't try to make some crazy language that you think
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  you can use for everything like that.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  Because if you look at the software stack,
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  like you have things that are written in C and even in C++
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  and then you have things that are written in Objective C
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  and why are these three languages there?
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  It's like, well, for the really low level stuff,
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  like the kernel and like, you may be even like, you know,
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  core foundation and like, then you have to see in C++
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  for those things, but then for like the higher level frameworks,
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  those are an Objective C and Swift is saying,
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  why can't we have one language that spans that whole range?
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  Why we have one language that maybe we're not going to write
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  the kernel in it just yet, but we could if we really wanted to.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  Because we wouldn't have to worry about a performance hit.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  Right, because it can be as fast as those low level languages,
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  but it can go all the way up to, hey, you just want to type
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  a bunch of stuff and, you know, you want to do, you know,
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  hash, bang, user-bin, Swift, and just start typing.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  And you want to create a string just by typing, you know,
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  quotation mark, here's the string, another quotation mark.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  All the things we love about JavaScript or Pearl or Ruby or Python,
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  and make one language that spans that whole range,
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  because it's an ambitious goal and it would be great for Apple
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  to pull it off because it's like, hey, finally,
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  we don't have to hire a C developer, C++,
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  the Objective C developers, and maintain a compiler that can compile
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  all three of those languages, but have different standards,
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  you got C99, C++11, and whatever the hell we're doing to
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:59.000]  Objective C. If we could just make one language that we control
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  everything about, that it's our thing that spans the entire range of
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  our things, boy, wouldn't that be amazing?
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  And maybe they're biting off more than they can chew,
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  but I admire the ambition, and then my question is,
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  how the hell are you going to do that?
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  And so I wanted to delve into how do you make a language?
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  It's easy to make the parts that you type.
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.000]  You could just say, blah, blah, blah, our language will
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  affect this, here's the key words, here's the syntax,
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  and then we'll just write a compiler that makes it turns that into
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  code that runs.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  And it's like, that's the hard part.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  How do you get from something that looks like JavaScript or
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  Pearl or Ruby or Python, but is as fast as C?
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  And that's what I spent the entire second of this
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  route delving into, because I think it's interesting and
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  definitely a change of pace from the way Apple has done
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  its compiler software in the past, and certainly a change of
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  pace from the way JavaScript runtimes are implemented,
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  or Java runtimes are certainly Ruby, Python, Pearl,
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  that stuff.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  Yeah, it's evident, and it's funny, because so many Apple
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  employees are just never in public and never named.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  And who knows how influential they are inside the company,
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  but because Chris Lattner started the LLVM project outside
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  Apple, and then more or less it's weird, because it wasn't a
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  company.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  It was an open source project, but they effectively
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  acquired him when they bought it.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  Or effectively bought the open source project when they
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  brought him in board.
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  But he's, you know, that's clearly to, you know, it's very
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  obvious like you said that there've been the rate of change of
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  objective C improvements over the last few years has been
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  impressive.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  Well, it coincides with the LLVM era.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Yeah, because they got the comp, they took control of the
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  product, you know, what, they should own and control the key
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  technologies for that platform.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  The compiler is one of those technologies.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  Why are we using GCC?
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  It's hampering our ability to extend the language,
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  just hampering our ability to optimize this hampering our ability
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  to make our IDE.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  They have this multi, multi year transition slowly,
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  slowly getting away from GCC to be a completely on an LLVM
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  based compiler.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  And then like they're off to the race.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  Right.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  And it's like you said, you have to look back to what are
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  the goals of the project.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  GCC is a fantastic project.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  It is one of the most successful computer science projects in
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  history.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  But it stated goal is to be a universal compiler for any and all
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  platforms.
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  And the fact that it succeeded at that is why it was there for
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  next to use when they started bolting on the objective C
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  features to see back in the 80s.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  It's the fact that GCC was there and aimed to be universal was
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  the reason that they could get it to work.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  But then the fact that it's universal and it's, you know,
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  this apparently convoluted, you know, really, really impenetrable
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  code base.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Eventually just really hampered their ability to move the
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  language forward.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  And it was also old, like it's an old code base.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  And then anything you did, it's kind of like doing anything with
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  W3C, you know, all that even worse actually.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  Anything you did, like kind of has to be your needs aren't
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  the only needs here.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  There are other stakeholders and you kind of have to get
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  agreement from all parties involved that this is the thing that
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  you want to do because there's just one code base where
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  as Apple doesn't need anyone's okay to do whatever the
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  hell they want with their compiler.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  And it's not quite like that.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  There's Clang and that stuff.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  That's a C, C++ compiler.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  Those are open source.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  There are other people that are using them.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  Apple can't just do whatever the hell they want with that type
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  of thing because they made it up with a fork because other
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  people would be like, well, I don't want Apple's clang.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  So they're sensitive that there.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  But thus far Swift is not open source and not open.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  And that's another issue people have with language.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  It's entirely theirs.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  I don't know if that will change in the future.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  I know there are people inside Apple who want it to be open
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  source, but there are, you know, that is not high on their
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  priority list apparently.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  Like right now they're just, you know, yeah, yeah,
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  I always say it out the door.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  Get your somebody out the door.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  Get the language in ship shape and then revisit this issue
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  in the future.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  I don't think they'll do anything like that until it settles
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  down until Swift of this year is nearly identical to Swift of last
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  year.
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  I don't think they need to like, that is, I understand that the
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  desire to do that, like the motivation, like what makes you feel
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  like, let's just, you know, let's just table this until we get our
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  stuff together.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  But compared to WebKit though, WebKit was like, you know,
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  open because it came from KHD.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  It was always open and did it, did it, like, well, we don't
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  want to make, we don't want to show WebKit to the world until
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  it settles down.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  Well, they show WebKit to the world as soon as they announce
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  Safari and it was definitely shaky and weird.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  And it doesn't seem to have hurt WebKit development.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  I think it can be done.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  It's just a question of, it's like, it's a question of priorities.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  And like, Apple has never been the greatest open source citizen in
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  terms of like, you have complete access to our repository.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  And you can see our changes in real time.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  They just do dumps.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  Like they do their work.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  It's hidden away.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  And then they release the product based on it.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  And then there's an open source dump.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  And that is not really the way that everyone wants open
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  source to work.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  But it's sure better than never giving the code at all.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  Yeah.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  The gist of it is that the more I learn about Swift and, you know,
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  it passed the intro, you know, chapter one of the Swift programming
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  book, just, you know, Hello World type programs.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  It's evident that it is exactly what you would think it is.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  It's a language designed by a compiler guy, which is interesting.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  Right?
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  A compiler guy who likes C++ a little bit.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  It clearly comes through a little bit.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  I mean, LLVM is written in C++.
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  And LLVM is, you know, like, so it's obviously everyone who
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  uses any language for a long period of time comes to hate that
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  language, but also kind of like it.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  It's like longer longer to use it the more you're just like the
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  parts that you hate just great and you're, but you also kind of
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  like it.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  So like Swift has a lot of the things in it.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  You're like, this person clearly hates a lot of features
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  about C++, but also kind of thinks some of them are kind of
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  okay.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  And just like, boy, I wish they had been done differently.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  But it's it's it's it's so obvious.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  And I think the details you delve into make a lot of these
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  things clear where it's it's never academically precocious.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  It's not this is clever.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  This, you know, which is like when when you and I were younger,
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  a lot of the new languages were were like Dylan or small talk
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  or Lisp.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  Yeah.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  Exactly.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  That it's like Mathematica or Haskell these days.
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  Right.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  Well, list predates us.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  Br list is from the 50s, but they're, you know, that that
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  that that whole derivative that whole realm of language is
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  Dylan's a perfect example because it was I think it came up
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  in the 90s.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  But, you know, it was academically interesting, but it
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  yeah, like it was like a purest viewpoint on something.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  Yeah, like how would you make Mac toolbox calls from Dylan?
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  Whereas Swift is like the whole purpose of this language is
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  like you have to be able to call into the both, you know, we
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  have to call into the C C++ and Objective C frameworks that
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  already exist.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  All right.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  So, you know, and we have to be able to work with like NS object
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  in the Objective C runtime.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  And by the way, we also even though it's a memory safe thing by
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  the way we also have to do it on safe point, just because
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  sometimes we need to do that like totally pragmatic because
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  it can't afford to do anything else.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  Like the mission statement is to be this language that spans
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  this huge range and it spans this huge range because guess what
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  Apple has a bunch of existing code in that huge range.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  And if you want to interface with it or some day replays it, you
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  have to span the same range and they get to use three languages
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  and you get our four languages or depending on how you can't
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  like, you know, C++, C, Objective C, and then like shell
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  scripting our Python or even Apple script or whatever.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  You want to try to span that whole range.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  You're going to have to be pragmatic about what you're willing
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  to do to your beautiful language.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  And it's, you know, a lot of the languages that are popular
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  were not designed by compiler guys.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  Larry Wall was not a compiler guy.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  I mean, it was, you know, it was, it was the replacement for
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  like a bunch of shell scripts and, you know, TR and said
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  and Hawk.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  And, you know, as I would just, more or less, it was,
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  here's the syntax I'd like to be able to write to do these things
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  and then he made a thing that did them.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  And I think, you know, you know, you said on ATP,
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  then a lot of, for decades after there's been a lot of work of,
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  well, how do we make this crazy language fast?
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Well, not so much for Pearl, but like JavaScript was very
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  simple.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Like all this syntax looks kind of like JavaScript is not really
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  and by the way, we'll make some way to run it.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  Right.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  And it was no consideration to how to make it fast.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  And then the result was an interesting language that was pretty
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  approachable for most people who can program and it was
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  dreadfully slow.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  And it's been, you said millions of dollars and like three,
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  four, five major generations of how are we actually going to
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  run JavaScript, you know, to get to where we are today,
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  where it runs at a reasonable speed, whereas Swift,
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  you know, being written by a compiler guy, maybe the
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  preeminent compiler guy in the world today has,
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  it just reeks from top to bottom of this is going to be fast.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  Or C was written by a compiler guy too, like the language
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  is that looks like, you know, the portable assembly,
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  like where you can see where it maps.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  It's not that rare for language to be written by a compiler
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  guy, but it's rare for a high level language.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  Right. Well, that's exactly it.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  That's exactly it where it, in fact,
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  C looks like it's written by a compiler guy because it looks
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  like compiler, you know, input.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  It looks like like an intermediary format.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  You know, you can squint that and see the assembly code
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  that corresponds.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Especially with like Sisk CPUs back in the day.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Yeah, and especially if you look at older C code,
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  you know, from the 70s and 80s,
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  before some of the, you know, slightly higher level features
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  that got added in, you know, later versions.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  Right.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  It's on its sleeve.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  It's a, you know, this is made to be easy to compile.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  You should read.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  You probably didn't because it really goes along,
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  but one of the many, many, many things I linked in the review
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  was a link to that awesome WebKit blog post
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  about the fourth, fourth tier LVM optimizer
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  for JavaScript, try actually reading that whole article
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  because they, like, they take you through it.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  It's really, really well written and like,
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  you just read a piece at a time.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  And you'll probably get like 50% 60% through it
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  and realize they haven't even gotten to the part
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  that tells you the new thing they did.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  Everything they've just described so far that is blowing your mind
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  is existing JavaScript optimization features.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  They haven't even gotten to the fourth tier part.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  Like the hoops they jumped through to make JavaScript fast
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  just make your head spin.
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  Like every one of them seems so incredibly dangerous
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  that it would be advisable to try
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  and seems impossible that it could ever be made to work.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  And yet that's, that's where we're all running
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  in our web browsers.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  Right.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  And it's, you know, on every platform.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  Every day, every, you know, and probably,
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  I mean, I don't see any way out of it
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  where for the rest of our life,
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  JavaScript is going to be a part of it.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  I don't know if the rest of our life,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  I'm going to plan on living for a long time,
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  but you got to get good with Dart and everything.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  Like people take runs at it from time to time.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  If anybody ever gets like, it's like, you know,
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  Bitcoin, if everyone ever gets 100,
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  more than 50% of the compute power.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  If anyone ever gets like dominant market share
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  and web browsers again, which doesn't look like it's going
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  to happen, but hey, who knows, they could replace it.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  They, you know, someone could seize the moment and be like,
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  like Google's trying to try with Dart.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  Like we have a popular browser, have everyone write Dart
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  and we can precompile it.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  And it's like JavaScript is able to be.
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  And everyone's like, no, sorry.
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  You don't have that kind of pull.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  We're just going to keep writing JavaScript.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  But I don't put it out of it.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Like even like when I like a Swift,
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  I made a few sly illusions and the thing of like,
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  oh, there's no reason that Apple couldn't say,
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  oh, and by the way, you can just like you can write Dart
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  and they'll run, you know, Chrome wherever you can put Swift code.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  And if you load your, in your web pages instead of JavaScript,
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  and when we load them, we will compile that Swift code
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  and keep the compile version.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  It'll be much faster than JavaScript because it's on that level
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  of like, it's not that much worse to use than JavaScript
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  and libraries are not up to snuff or whatever.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  Or even just server-side web programming.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  Like the places where a Swift can draw is not,
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  not constrained in the same way as Objective C
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  or any of Apple's other languages.
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  So if Apple ever wanted to make that move and say,
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  you know, you can use JavaScript as your scripting language
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  in your web page or you can use Swift to do it.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  Like if you were going to make like an iOS-only web app
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  where you knew the target platform could do that.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  With the built-in library that's in the browser,
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  you know, with a bunch of niceties.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  Yeah, and the compiler gets fast enough in the language.
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  Like there are many things that are possible
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  when this very new baby Swift starts getting mature.
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  Like if they succeed in their goal to make a language
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  that spans this range and that is able to be fast
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  and everything is all sorts of places to go.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  Like even just down to like the stupid shell scripts
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  and pearl scripts that have that are buried
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  inside the installer packages,
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  also for our newest 10. If Swift had a file IO library,
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  it was worth a damn instead of having to use code go over.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  The language doesn't preclude that.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  They could make change all the scripts like
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  you could really make one be unified language
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  or it could turn out that 10 years from now,
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  we turned out it was folly to try to span that range
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  with one language and didn't work out.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  Well, and it makes me, it's funny too,
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  and it makes me think it's one of those things
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  where it was like, you know, inside Apple,
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  a lot of people don't know what was going on.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  I mean, almost nobody knew that Swift was going on.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  Everybody I talked to at Apple was surprised
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  by Swift's announcement as we were.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  That's why we're working for Apple's exciting.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  You're like, what the what?
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  To me, it's an unfortunate coincidence
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  that it also happened to be the year
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  that the automation group added JavaScript support
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  as an alternative to Apple script.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  Everywhere you can write Apple script now,
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  you can write JavaScript.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  It seems to me like a better idea might have been
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  to hold off on that and wait until you can do it in Swift.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  Did you see the tweets on head?
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  With the JavaScript automation of the OASA script thing,
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  you can use the JavaScript automation
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  to call into an objective C library
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  that loads Ruby and then you run Ruby code.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  It was like four languages in one command line,
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  like showing like all the things.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  There's always weird bridges, you know,
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  because you can, from Apple script,
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  from JavaScript JavaScript automation,
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  you can load objective C libraries.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  And from some objective C libraries,
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  you can load the Ruby things, I guess,
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  from the Ruby code code thing or whatever.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  It is quite, and then just just Swift into that mix too,
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  they can interoperate with the objective C as well.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  I'll sort of self out, I guess.
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  I guess so, but it seems to me like the future,
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  I mean, I'm always happy when the automation stuff
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  has any new features, because I'm always afraid
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  that they're going to turn the lights out on South group.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  So it's, it's great libraries.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  What's that?
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  I think a library's last year, right?
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  Yeah, no, they've been at, no,
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  I don't think a JavaScript.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Right.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  I only say that because I just know that
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  at a high level Apple's interest isn't there.
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  I'm not saying that the last couple of years
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  haven't been good.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  I think the last couple of years have been great.
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  Like script libraries have been great.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  They've been, you know,
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  and I think adding JavaScript as a supported language is great.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  I just can't help but think though that in a long run,
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  there'll be more scripts written in automation scripts
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  written in Swift than AppleScript or JavaScript.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  For all those things, and the reason you can have all these
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  different languages, the problem is not the language,
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  except maybe JavaScript, which is a gross language
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  to people who want like a regular programming language.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  Well, and it's,
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  the problem is the APIs you're talking to.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  Like that's the hard part.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  It's like you got to figure out what is,
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  what is the dictionary support?
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  How do I, can I do what I need to do?
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  Can I address this window in a way that is reliable?
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  Can I get it the, the element in this window?
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  Can it like, it's all down to how scriptable the application is.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  And the language is just like a minor implementation detail
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  at that point.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  Most of the time you're fighting with the scripting
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  dictionaries of the apps that will even let you do
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  what you want to do and what kind of weird hoops do you have to jump through?
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  Well, I'm just thinking of that if they, if they can eventually
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  get it to be swift, it would be easier to call into,
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  like if you wanted to put like a nib or a zip,
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  how are you pronounce it?
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  How are you pronounce the XIB version?
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  Yeah, it sounds like a zip file with your script that it's,
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  you know, it would be a lot more, you know, just like,
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  since Coco already uses it, it would be easier to call it
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  from the scripting side to it if it was the same language.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  Yeah, but then you kind of doing actual real application development.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  Like you're not, you're not going to be able to call it.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  You still have to send Apple events, right?
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  I guess so.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  I don't know.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  I mean, you do now.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  I don't know.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  It's not like they're going to let you call natively into the, you know,
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  like, I don't know.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  The automation story has always been a little bit weird.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  I think it has been making progress in a recent year.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  So I'm kind of optimistic about it.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  And I like the idea that like when they renamed Apple script editor,
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  or script editor, and now actually when you launch it,
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  you can pick which language you want to be your default.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  And each window has a little pop up menu that says,
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  it's a script editor. Do you want to write Apple script?
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  Or JavaScript?
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  Or Swift script?
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  Not quite yet.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  But like, it's poised to, you know,
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  I was always supposed to be multi-language,
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  but for the longest time it was like multi-language in theory.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  And now it's finally multi-language and actuality again.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  So yeah, finally.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  It is final.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  That's an actual non-ironic, non-ironic, finally.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Yeah, there's probably, I can kind of think of what other languages
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  that people have been using.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  People won't use Frontier anymore.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  No, but that was one of them.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  Well, and there was JavaScript.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  Mark Aldrich of late-night software,
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  the guy behind script debugger,
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  and he had face span for a while.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  He had a JavaScript OSA that was built,
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  I'm going to say Mozilla's JavaScript engine.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  That worked, but it never really took off.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  Because I think it's the sort of thing where it had to come from Apple
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  to really take off.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  There were certain weirdnesses that,
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  using JavaScript instead of Apple script,
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  you ended up with tangled syntax that was like,
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  what?
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  And it would take Apple to fix it
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  because it kind of had to be fixed at the OSA level,
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  not at the language level.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  Yeah, that's always been a little bit weird.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  I mean, it's like, the language is just so different.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  How can you call the same things?
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  And it's always, you know,
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  especially when you're calling it to other libraries,
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  again, because JavaScript's going to import the objective C stuff
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  and then you're making object C calls with name parameters,
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  but JavaScript doesn't have name parameters.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  So you got all these mangled things.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  It's just like the Python cocoa bridge,
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  they've had and everything.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  Almost cross language things are weird,
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  but OSA is always going to be cross language,
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  because it's always the whole point of it.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  It's open scripting architecture.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  It always comes back to Apple script.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  Anyway, we've gone on long enough, I think.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  It's been a good show.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  I love your review.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  And ATP is my favorite show.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Thank you.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  Really is.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  And it's all because of you.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  I always know.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  You're trying to make up for that at a Corbin post.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  Well, here's the thing.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  I like Casey.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  I like Marco.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  But one of the things that's interesting about the ATP
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  is that you guys often disagree.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  Maybe even usually one of the three of you
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  is going to disagree.
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  And whenever there's an argument and I'm listening
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  and I know everybody out there,
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  people often tell me this.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  It's like everybody listens to podcasts and knows this feeling.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  Where like somebody will say something
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  and you want to jump in and you know,
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  either correct something they said was wrong
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  or point out the logical conclusion of where this is going.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  And the thing that makes ATP my favorite show
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  is that you're always there to do it.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  And it's so satisfying.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  Like I'll think, oh, I gotta write to these guys
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  and tell them that reminds me of something.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  And as soon as you have a chance to jump in,
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  nine times out of 10, you say exactly what it is
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  that I was hoping somebody would say.
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  Yeah.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  I cut both ways.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  I was just complaining one of the after shows recently.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  I think I tweeted you about it.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  Like when you're talking about the 16 gigs of flash
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  which we didn't get to talk about in the iOS devices
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  and how this terrible, like we recorded an ATP
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  and I called that move like a punitive move
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  in Apple's part.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  And then you, before we could post our show,
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  you either posted a blog post about it
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  where you called it punitive or released a podcast
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  about it where you called it punitive.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  And it's like, God damn it.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  Like it says it's for both same thing,
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  but yours got out first.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  But yeah.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  I know the feel like again,
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  when I hear you on podcast,
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  I think the same thing.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  Like we tend to think and say the same things.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  And then it's like half the time,
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  you're excited to hear the other person
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  chiming in with what you would have said
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  if you're there.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  And the other half the time,
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  you're like, I was just thinking that.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  I'm a bit credit for that idea.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  We shouldn't go on long about it,
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  but we could talk about the 16 gig thing quickly.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  But I think if you want to stop dancing around
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  the elephant room,
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  I think the bottom line is,
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  and I think you guys even mentioned this,
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  what it all comes down to is it is a fear
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  in the back of our heads that this is a Tim Cook thing.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  Because it really only makes sense.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  I think it makes perfect sense.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  If you're staring at a spreadsheet of component costs
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  and profit margins
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  and the combined net with a projection
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  of how a 1664 128 spread
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  would push X number of people to get 64
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  instead of the lower price model
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  than in a 3264 128 scenario.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  From a spreadsheet perspective,
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  it makes perfect sense.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  I completely understand every aspect of it.
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  But in every other way,
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  it is, to me, it's a bone-headed mistake.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  But Tim Cook's the same guy going on all the talk shows
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  and TV stations and talking about how Apple
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  doesn't do moves that are short-term.
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  It's not looking for short-term stock market game.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  It's long-term thinking of whatever.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  So he's saying all the right things,
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  but sometimes people just make mistakes.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  And like I said,
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  I'm talking about this decision to go with the 1664 128.
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  This decision was made a long time ago.
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  And I think by now, when they're having the meetings
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  about like iOS 8 adoption and storage space and stuff like that,
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  hopefully they're going to correct for it.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  They're not perfect.
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  They make mistakes.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  I think they maybe just miscalculated.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  They were dazzled by all the things that you mentioned.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  Look at how we can push people up to the product line
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  and in exchange, do we think there are any downsides to the 16?
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  And they were able to convince themselves that the downsides
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  weren't that big of a deal.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  But that still sawing 16s and still sawing the A5
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  with no way for developers to exclude it,
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  I think the meetings they're having now,
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  hopefully they're discussing these things and saying,
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  going forward for the next set of things,
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  let's not make this particular mistake again.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  Let's remedy this.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  There's a big lag time on this type of thing.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  Again, when they came out with that same range
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  and when they came out with the iPads
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  and it was the same range,
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  it's not like they can learn that lesson between like,
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  it's just there is a long turnaround time this
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  and I'm hoping that this is not like a,
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  like them being duplicitous about the philosophy
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  but merely a mistake that they will correct going forward.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  I hope so.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  Because my fear is if they don't go to 32 next year
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  then they're already going to be too late with 32
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  and when they do go to 32,
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  it's already going to be 32 is too little.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  And the thing is, it's on them to get this right
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  because they're the company that does not add an SD card slot
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  to their iOS devices.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  So they really, and you can't upgrade it
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  and so like they really need, they really need to get this right.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  And they're doing things like making cameras that shoot.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  Yeah, 1080p video.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  Really, really credible 1080p video.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  Like really good.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  Like you're not going to regret that, you know,
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  this is your footage of your, you know,
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  son's first birthday.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  And time lapse and burst mode.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  Like there's so many ways you can fill up that storage real fast.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  Right.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  But 41 megapixel panoramic images.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  Which is great.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  But which are huge.
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Yeah, it's like count.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  It's just, yeah.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  It's the, I remember this was the most recent episode of the one before.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  But it's like the, and you mentioned it
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  when you were talking about how like this is the type of device
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  where you have to give caveats.
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  We can tell people to buy it.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  Yeah.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  It's like all of us told people who wanted to buy Macs
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  back when Macs were first becoming popular.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  We just always tell them back in the day.
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  Like you can go get a power book.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  They're really awesome.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  But make sure you upgrade the RAM.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  They say, really do I need to upgrade them like trust me by default.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  It comes with an amount of RAM that is ridiculous.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  No, and, and we also used to tell them to get a third party RAM
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  because Apple used to charge you a ton for it.
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  Like those stupid caveats they used to tell,
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  how many years did we spend telling people
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  upgrade the RAM don't buy Apple's RAM by third party?
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  It added a complication and a caveat to a recommendation
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  that made it scarier for people.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  Yeah.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  And now that, that type of thing is creeping back in where like,
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  don't, don't buy the 16s.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  You're going to regret it.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  If you're asking me advice on which one you should buy
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  or the type of person who should not buy the 16,
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  trust me, save money for a couple more months
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  and get the, you know, 64.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  Yeah, I, I just can't, I don't know.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  It just, or irks me that there's,
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  and it doesn't bother me quite as much that like the lower end
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  models that the old, I, you know, I've had,
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  uh, minis are 16.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  But it really irks me that the new top of the line one
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  starts at 16.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  Like this, though, there's, there's an unsafe model to buy
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  in the flagship iPhone 6.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  Right. Like people who are only going to spend $299 on their iPad
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  are kind of, I'm sure going into it with eyes wide open that they
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  know they're not getting the best and that they're, you know,
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  that there's going to be some limits.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  Whereas anybody buying a new iPad Air 2,
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  uh, I think that they should feel confident that no matter which one they
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  get, that it's, it's a good, it's, you know, good,
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  better best not.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  And, and RAM is the same thing.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Like when they used to sell Mac models with two little RAMs,
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  like you're only hurting your own image app because there was
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  nothing worse than a Mac with a spinning disk and two little RAM.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Yeah.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  And it just didn't get better.
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  Memory compression was the perhaps the only bump that actually made like the
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  RAM usage to get better.
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Right.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  But every other thing, like three OS versions from now,
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  that RAM is going to be even worse.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  At least you could upgrade the RAM until it started soldering it on.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  And once it did start soldering around, I was glad that they bumped
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  everybody up to 16 minimum and everything.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Like they're finally getting on the ball on that.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  But now they just dropped the ball.
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  Yeah.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  And it's, it's like I've been writing that it's,
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  it's like a brand thing.
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  And it's, you can't measure that on the spreadsheet.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  But the RAM thing with Macs, like, and I know on the ATP use,
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  it's like four, four megabytes of RAM.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  Which shows how old the problem.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  I remember when four, four megabytes of RAM was the baseline.
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  And it was years past where anybody else in the industry had gone
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  to like 16.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  But I think even to this day, all the way from the era when,
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  when they were selling Macs with only four megabytes,
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  megabytes of RAM to today, that helped fuel the image that
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  so many people have that Apple price gouges people.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  Because everybody was told you have to upgrade the RAM.
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  And don't buy it from Apple.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  Don't buy it from Apple.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  Go to crucial or, you know, somebody like that.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  And then get someone to install it or all in store it for you.
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  And feel like you're breaking your brand new machine
[2:58:51.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  because you'd have to do this thing that made a snap, you know,
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  it never felt good.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  But when, you know, and you go and you'd say like,
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  go to crucial, crucial has great RAM.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  You'd Google some reviews and everybody would say,
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  crucial sells high quality RAM.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  This is good, these are good memory chips.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  And then you see that you are saving $600 versus what Apple would charge you
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  for the same amount of RAM.
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  And it's actually, it was actually true that Apple was price gouging you.
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  Because you know that Apple gets better prices on the RAM than you do,
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  or that crucial does.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  And then they would, they would be kind of jerks about it,
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  where like they wouldn't service your machine,
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:29.000]  have a third party RAM and it and all sorts of crap like that.
[2:59:29.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  Remember those days?
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  Yeah, you'd take it in.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  And they would, you would have to, you yourself would have to
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  take out your third party RAM and hide it from them.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  Right.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  Keep it in your desk in an anti-static sleeve or something like that.
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  And I get, and if you replaced all of the RAM,
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  I guess you'd have to like go and find your old Apple chips that you replaced
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  and put them back in.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  Yeah.
[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  And yeah.
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:51.000]  And this is not a good product experience.
[2:59:51.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  It shouldn't be like that.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:55.000]  And like they had anything like that that just,
[2:59:55.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  you'd never want to sell somebody something that you know,
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  three years from now, they're going to hate you for buying.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  Right.
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  You should not sell the base model accord,
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  should not have trouble accelerating up a hill.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  You know, it may not go anywhere near as fast as the tricked out high-end model.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  But it's still, you shouldn't have trouble with common things like driving up a hill.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  Yeah.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  It's just some baseline level.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  And you don't want to skip things like that,
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  especially the weird and esoteric and that you know,
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  as someone who knows the technology, again,
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  especially with Spain,
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  this kind of such a dramatic effect on performance.
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  There was nothing worse than early versions of OS X swapping.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  Like there was just nothing.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  It would just, your performance would go off a giant cliff
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  and there was nothing you could do about it.
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  And even if you told people like,
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  we'll just run one application at a time or quit more apps.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  And it was just like,
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  this is not the way it should work.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  And then obviously you can't give all the RAM of the world every machine.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  But the rest of the industry would slowly march up the minimum
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  and Apple would stubbornly stay at whatever number they decided
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  was the correct number for just years past when they should.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  Yeah.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  It's less excusable now than ever because you know
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  that they're getting the economies of scale
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  and that they can get the best prices.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  Yeah.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  They're using the same components.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  It's not like they have to get special RAM for their special power
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  BC chips or anything.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Right.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  And like you even mentioned it on ATP
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  that there was a story that Apple's consuming like 50% of the world's
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  SSD storage.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  Or 25% of the nan or whatever it was.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  Whatever it is.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  But I'm sure that's true and it's impressive,
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  it doesn't, you know, they're not just buying it in an open market.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  It's not like they're going...
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  Yeah.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  They are a huge input into that market.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  They influence the market.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  They're planning ahead of time for like, you know,
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  because if you're billion dollars build a factory
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  because we're going to ask you to buy the stuff for us
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  and you'll slowly pay off what we loan you for the fact.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Right.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  That's the way they do all their stuff.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  Right.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  So if they wanted to tell people a year ago,
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  hey, we want to buy X million 32 gigabyte chips
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  because that's what they were going to put in the iPad there too.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  They could have had it.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  Every 16 gigabyte chip that they have
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  could be a 32 gigabyte one if they had wanted it to be.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  Yeah.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  Or maybe like two years ago when I was going to lead time
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  to like, you know, tooling and factory.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  But Apple, again, that type of thing.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  Apple is in the position to do that and they do it all the time.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  They will pay for the people to build the capacity
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  that they're going to use to build their products
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  and get the money back until it's fine.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  They probably did it with Taiwan semiconductor
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  to do the A8.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  I'm sure Apple was paying billions and millions of dollars
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  to make that happen.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Yeah.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  I think that a lot of these decisions are made two years in advance.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  But I think if they wanted to go 16 to 32 baseline,
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  that's the type of change they could make a little bit.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Yeah.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Because it's not that far.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  You just look at the Android phones.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  Right.
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  A lot of Android phones sell a lot of them sell with, you know,
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  this much flash and then like again, you know,
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  discounting the SD card slots and everything like that.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  It's not so far outside the realm.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  If anything would be outside the realm,
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  it would be like these crazy super retina.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  I'm at displays that are probably in short supply
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  and that one you really can say, look, you know,
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  no matter how much you pay,
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  we're just barely able to make these now.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  But 16 to 32, that is old tech.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  Android's been shipping with it for years
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  and years and lots of phones.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  So it was within reach.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  All right.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  Let's call it a show.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Anybody, I can't imagine that there's anybody who listened
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  to this episode,
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  who hasn't already read your review.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  Or pretended to read it.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  Or pretended to read it.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  But if you haven't, you should.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  You can do it the right way,
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  the right way is to read it on the website.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  That's the canonical version.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  But I bought a copy for iBooks anyway
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  because I wanted it to be a best seller.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  You got a long way to go to make up for how many shirts
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  I bought from you.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  My eBooks are cheap, man.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  It's not $30 for one of these books.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  Buy copies for your whole family.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Great, great Christmas gift idea.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  Right.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  Don't use family sharing.
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  Just buy a copy for everybody.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  Kids love it.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  Always a pleasure.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  I don't know.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  It's funny because now we have a mini tradition
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  of you coming on after your...
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  You never asked me on any other time.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  So now you're going to have to actually think
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  of some other reason to talk to me.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  I'm going to have to think of another reason.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  You should have had me on to argue with you about
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  following extensions to that other Canadian guy.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Oh, God.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Whether we wouldn't have had an argument.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Would we?
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  No, but I felt like that was a case where
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  you were on my side of the debate
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  and I felt like I could have done a better job.
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Yeah, probably.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  Finding off that foreigner.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  Yeah, anytime we get into an argument about metadata,
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  I'm going to word it far less eloquently as you.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  There were some stronger arguments that you could have deployed.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  Anyway, I'll be on the podcast with a joke
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  or sometime we'll have it out.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  That's what you get.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  I mean, that's what you get when you're from Canada.
