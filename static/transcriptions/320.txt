[00:00.000 --> 00:01.560]  Hello
[00:01.560 --> 00:05.960]  Hello, how are you? I I'm good. How are you? I mean this sincerely
[00:07.200 --> 00:10.160]  I'm okay. I'm okay. This pandemic sucks
[00:10.160 --> 00:15.380]  I think everybody who listens to the show and you are very astute, you know
[00:15.380 --> 00:21.920]  I'm not one for corniness, but I mean this to everybody out there listening. I hope everybody's alright
[00:21.920 --> 00:28.080]  It's more stressful than it has been in a long time because of the uncertainty. Don't you think? Yes, that's
[00:28.080 --> 00:30.720]  100% it. I was on the phone with my mom yesterday
[00:31.600 --> 00:34.880]  It was her birthday. Happy birthday to my mom. Shout out to her. She's awesome and
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.520]  my parents are in their 70s and they're in good health and my mom especially but
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.640]  She's worried about this other surge and she lives in a state Georgia where people don't take stuff as seriously as they should and there's
[00:48.640 --> 00:54.600]  drama right now where one of the major school systems doesn't even have mask mandates most of them do fortunately and
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.400]  She's wanting to investigate getting a booster and whatnot and
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.960]  She made appointments for them for the end of next week with the hope that there will be an announcement
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.480]  By then that people who are older will be able to go ahead and get a booster because right now the guidelines are if you're
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.520]  immuno compromised
[01:12.520 --> 01:17.360]  So like if you have like a big form of cancer or like a transplant or something like that, right?
[01:17.640 --> 01:23.040]  Though I go ahead and and the CDC has approved it but she's just kind of waiting I guess for that next level
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.340]  They're saying eight months and and she would be a little bit before then but just trying to kind of figure out
[01:28.680 --> 01:34.440]  Well, are they saying eight months because that's when it's safe or is it because that's like a supply constraint
[01:34.960 --> 01:37.440]  There's all sorts of ways that people are
[01:38.040 --> 01:45.640]  immuno compromised an aunt who had MS for decades and yes, she never had a transplant but took similar
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.920]  drugs that people who've had organ transplants take it was part of the regime of
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.480]  Mitigating the symptoms of MS. It's also stressful
[01:55.600 --> 02:02.160]  It's like overall the situation is better even today with the Delta with everything that's going on
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.960]  It is still better than it was at the worst points of this pandemic
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.680]  but the uncertainty
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.040]  Really reminds me of the early months of the pandemic and I would argue in some ways
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.120]  It almost feels worse because you're right. It is better than it was at like the worst parts of the pandemic
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.440]  But we had this period where we were kind of coming out of it and we were starting to assimilate and go back to normal
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.480]  And now we're in this period where not only do we have the uncertainty that I agree with you
[02:30.480 --> 02:31.720]  It's similar to the beginning
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.280]  but then you have this added stress of the PTSD that we all have of remembering what it was before and
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.920]  We were just doing more normal things now. Can we can we not like it? It's shitty. Yeah
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.120]  I'm it's so super super lucky. Both of my parents are still in
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.840]  Good health and they listen they read the news. They do what's recommended. They say you should wear masks
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.560]  They wear masks. They say you should get vaccinated. They signed up as soon as they could but I'm worried about them
[03:01.560 --> 03:06.440]  I really am because you look at the statistics and truly one of the things that's
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.920]  It seems not in question is even if vaccinated if you're above
[03:13.920 --> 03:19.040]  65 or so you're still at a fairly significant risk
[03:19.040 --> 03:26.560]  You're more likely to catch it. And if you do you're still significantly more likely to have a bad run of it
[03:27.720 --> 03:31.560]  Yeah, exactly. And I like you I worry too and my parents are in good health
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.040]  Like I said, but it's a concern and so that is the stress but so anyway
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.800]  We got the show off on a I know
[03:39.800 --> 03:41.800]  upbeat note
[03:41.800 --> 03:49.200]  The other thing too is we have a full agenda. We have lots of stuff to talk about and not all of it. It's
[03:50.440 --> 03:52.800]  It's a lot of unpleasantness. Yeah
[03:53.680 --> 03:55.680]  Like yes, I joke
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.200]  And I know it's it's not a joking matter, but it is I've said to my wife
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.520]  It's like it is bizarre how much time I have spent thinking about child pornography in the last month
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.120]  And and it's like of all the things that I needed on my agenda, right?
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.120]  I did not want this. This is so upsetting the whole thing. Well, we'll get to that in a bit
[04:17.240 --> 04:19.240]  Do you have a topic you want to start on?
[04:20.480 --> 04:21.920]  Don't know
[04:21.920 --> 04:27.800]  Is there anything fun? Yeah, let's let's try to think about something that is actually pleasant
[04:28.080 --> 04:35.840]  How about the Safari 15 story which yeah, I think is actually the probably the most pleasant thing on the agenda
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.120]  I think so. And I think it's good. They listened. We won. I
[04:41.760 --> 04:43.760]  Do think that it's
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.800]  Exacerbated so for anybody who's listening far in the future and who doesn't remember the saga of?
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.560]  Safari 15 betas in the summer of 2021
[04:55.360 --> 04:57.360]  Apple announced a
[04:57.640 --> 04:59.480]  thorough
[04:59.480 --> 05:06.000]  Unenvisioning of the way tabs work in Safari on all three platforms Mac iPad iPhone
[05:07.480 --> 05:16.200]  In fairly different ways, I guess the iPad and Mac interfaces as proposed were a little bit more
[05:18.440 --> 05:24.580]  Aligned like it was sort of a Mac a vacation of iPad and iPad a vacation of Mac
[05:24.580 --> 05:30.180]  The especially on iPhone in particular there were some aspects of what was announced at
[05:30.580 --> 05:36.920]  WWDC that without rehashing all of what was bad about that design. It was bad
[05:37.960 --> 05:39.960]  with some good
[05:40.540 --> 05:43.520]  fundamental top-level thinking mixed in I
[05:44.080 --> 05:50.280]  Think the ideas were maybe good. I think the execution initially flawed that I understand where the thinking came from
[05:50.280 --> 05:57.160]  I I would say in large part a top-level it is hey our phones are getting bigger
[05:57.600 --> 06:03.200]  The bigger iPhones are selling better. There are even rumors without even
[06:03.880 --> 06:05.880]  diverging on a tangent that
[06:06.640 --> 06:10.320]  Next year, not the ones that we expect to come in September
[06:10.320 --> 06:16.440]  But next year that they are going to have a big-ass iPhone at the non-pro
[06:16.440 --> 06:23.280]  Tier right like one of the holes I would say the the most glaring hole in the iPhone lineup right now
[06:23.280 --> 06:30.800]  Is that the only way to get a truly big like 6.5 inch diagonal iPhone right now is to get the iPhone?
[06:31.040 --> 06:36.260]  12 Pro Max which is very very expensive and it's heavy and you're
[06:36.760 --> 06:43.120]  paying for the highest quality camera Apple's ever made blah blah blah and there are even rumors that
[06:43.120 --> 06:48.680]  Whatever next year's phone is going to be if this year's the 12s maybe next year's the 13
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.000]  Maybe this year's iPhone 13 next year's iPhone whatever next September
[06:53.360 --> 06:57.760]  That there's going to be a big-ass phone. The phones are getting bigger people like big phones
[06:57.760 --> 07:03.720]  People are doing way more if not all of their personal computing on their phones
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.320]  So why not right why not?
[07:06.320 --> 07:13.360]  Put more of the controls towards the bottom of the screen because the top of the screen is hard to hard
[07:14.360 --> 07:15.760]  impossible to reach
[07:15.760 --> 07:17.960]  With one hand. Yeah. Yeah
[07:17.960 --> 07:24.640]  No, I mean and and as somebody who for many years was totally against the big phones because I have really small hands. I
[07:25.480 --> 07:32.560]  Like that and ironically I'm on like the the Pro Max whatever my argument there is that even the smallest phone?
[07:32.560 --> 07:37.360]  I still have to use two hands. So I might as well just have the bigger battery like at this point
[07:37.360 --> 07:40.400]  Even the iPhone mini is too big. So I
[07:41.560 --> 07:44.320]  Might as well just get the giant phone, but you're right
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.520]  I mean I think is more and more people use them as their primary kind of personal computing device
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.620]  Not having to reach up all the way having stuff at the bottom is a good move and as somebody who frequently does that
[07:55.620 --> 07:58.920]  Like I'm not opposed to to those things like at a top level
[07:58.920 --> 08:04.440]  Right the basic idea I think at a high level was all right
[08:04.440 --> 08:08.420]  We've got this important stuff at the top of the screen on the phone
[08:08.960 --> 08:13.120]  like the URL bar the AA button for
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.680]  Adjusting the visual layout the reload button. I mean, can you believe?
[08:19.720 --> 08:24.200]  We temporarily lost the reload button. Oh my god. I've never almost
[08:24.200 --> 08:30.800]  Gone back to an OS before her. I know, you know when we had that I was like, I cannot believe this
[08:30.800 --> 08:32.800]  This is almost unusable
[08:34.680 --> 08:38.720]  It's all good now beta six now, it's good beta six, it's good
[08:38.720 --> 08:43.040]  They've they've listened you can put stuff back at the top of you want the bottom is better
[08:43.160 --> 08:46.520]  They got rid of the weird color stuff that I don't think worked. Oh
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.600]  Yeah, and it's I guess that's still I to me the biggest surprise that people who don't pay attention
[08:53.600 --> 08:56.840]  To the betas and god bless you all, you know
[08:56.840 --> 08:59.640]  Especially if you if you're nerdy enough to listen to the show
[08:59.800 --> 09:07.100]  But not nerdy enough to to have a spare device or to be reckless enough to put these betas on your main iPhone
[09:07.100 --> 09:14.320]  I I got that and and I I do think the longer you wait to get on these betas
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.240]  For on a device that you really need the wiser you are
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.760]  But there's a lot of people and I hear from them who have a sort of ah, I ignore that stuff right after
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.680]  WWDC I wait till August and maybe I get on the beta then and I got a couple of emails this week
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.120]  From people who like started on beta six and they're like, I don't see what the big deal is
[09:36.120 --> 09:38.120]  No, cuz you chose the right time, right?
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.040]  Honestly, like so it's weird cuz I no longer professionally need to be on the betas and in fact in some cases
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.680]  It's it's a bad thing because for to work stuff like if something doesn't work, right? Like it could be a problem
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.160]  I do still have like secondary devices. They'll put stuff on but I'm so used to at this point like it's been like
[09:55.880 --> 10:00.880]  More than a decade that I always have the beta, you know running usually the developer beta
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.000]  Those are like hard habits to break, but I think you're exactly right
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.040]  I think for most people I would be like if you can't wait until September the right time is usually like mid-august
[10:09.040 --> 10:16.200]  That's usually the right time in my opinion to get going with the beta because most the egregious stuff is worked out
[10:16.200 --> 10:17.720]  The showstoppers are done
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.200]  Yeah
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.520]  and you're getting close to what you're gonna see in the final version right because for better or for worse and
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.280]  Some years it's good some years. It's you know, I guess it was what iOS
[10:31.560 --> 10:36.480]  13 was the one that was the bad. Yeah, I was 13 two years ago was the
[10:36.480 --> 10:38.480]  Yeah, really rocky
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.680]  Release where literally three days after the new iPhones were introduced. They came out with iOS 13.1
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.840]  The point release like right there. Yeah, not not
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.040]  13.0.1 like with minor bug fixes but like a
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.120]  Truly significant release but that they had to flash
[10:59.840 --> 11:02.280]  What was we're just gonna call this
[11:02.280 --> 11:07.440]  13.0 had to start flashing it onto iPhones and three days later came out with a point release
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.640]  Overall, I think the forcing function of hey
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.680]  Everybody working on iOS. We have to be cognizant of the fact that the general plan is
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.560]  the company is going to announce new phones early in September and
[11:24.080 --> 11:27.000]  The new OS has to be ready then by mid-september
[11:27.760 --> 11:29.760]  Come hell or high water it
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.720]  It works for Apple overall and even yeah
[11:33.720 --> 11:41.040]  the iOS 13 story worked out pretty well overall and and they do a clever thing that they don't get enough credit for which is
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.040]  Not every version of iOS
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.800]  Especially the new ones in September
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.800]  Gets pushed to people as a hey, there's a new version to upgrade
[11:52.800 --> 11:56.940]  Do you want to upgrade hit this button and it'll upgrade overnight while your phone is charging
[11:56.940 --> 12:02.580]  I was 13.0 didn't get pushed to anybody, you know, you could get it if you wanted it, right?
[12:02.580 --> 12:06.580]  If you if you went in it and checked manually you could get it but it wasn't going to push itself, right?
[12:06.580 --> 12:10.820]  Which is smart and in that way they can kind of temper. Okay
[12:11.780 --> 12:16.180]  How far are we from the next release that the next update right are there problems?
[12:16.500 --> 12:23.260]  Are we even maybe even getting telemetry and feedback that this isn't working and do we need to stop notifying people, you know?
[12:23.260 --> 12:31.500]  So I think that next month if iOS 15 gets pushed out around this time in September
[12:31.500 --> 12:34.740]  You know the 20th or so or whatever the day of the month, you know
[12:34.740 --> 12:37.460]  I guess they usually push them out on a Friday whatever that day is
[12:37.460 --> 12:45.300]  I think the one thing about Safari that might I I think moving the address bar to the bottom but attaching it
[12:45.620 --> 12:46.940]  above
[12:46.940 --> 12:53.980]  the tool, you know the standard toolbar that we know and love and which I think is very thoughtfully considered and
[12:54.500 --> 13:00.700]  Shouldn't have changed and hasn't changed. I think people will get that your eyes might go to the top of your phone
[13:00.700 --> 13:07.500]  I'm still I'm trying to get used to it now that they've adjusted to it. I'm using it on a spare iPhone
[13:07.700 --> 13:09.740]  I'm not sure if I'll stick with it or not
[13:09.740 --> 13:14.380]  But people will get used to that the thing that I think people might be like, whoa
[13:14.380 --> 13:19.500]  What is this is the color tinting? Daring fireball happens to be a very good example of it
[13:19.500 --> 13:25.940]  Where if you go to my website with the iOS 15 beta 6 of Safari?
[13:26.380 --> 13:32.540]  as you scroll and the toolbar fades away at the bottom and the top to make room for content the
[13:32.860 --> 13:38.060]  The chrome at the top and bottom take on the background color of the website
[13:38.060 --> 13:45.220]  It's okay. You know, I I have mixed feelings about it. I'm not sure I don't have a hot take on it
[13:45.620 --> 13:52.220]  Yeah, I don't have a hot take on it on iOS. I don't like the implementation on Mac. Yeah
[13:52.300 --> 13:55.620]  Yeah, and I think it works worse on Mac and iPad
[13:56.460 --> 14:02.060]  Because Mac and iPad you switch tabs directly. Yes. That's the thing on the iPhone
[14:02.060 --> 14:07.460]  You always are in a single tap and and you have to manually press that button and then scroll through it
[14:07.460 --> 14:14.660]  Whereas you are tapping or touching if you're using the touch bar for some reason you are going to those
[14:15.300 --> 14:17.300]  places manually, so
[14:17.420 --> 14:19.700]  Sorry, I always have to make fun of the touch bar. It's just such a
[14:21.060 --> 14:27.260]  You know, I haven't even thought to look at what iOS and I actually because I've got
[14:27.980 --> 14:31.260]  the the Mac OS beta running on the
[14:31.260 --> 14:39.500]  iMac review unit that I write I'm clinging to until this beta is not beta anymore and then I'll send it back
[14:39.980 --> 14:43.140]  Therefore, I don't know what it looks like with the touch bar. I'm a similar thing
[14:43.140 --> 14:47.340]  I have it running on an iMac might and I have it like in a container, but I don't have it on a
[14:48.260 --> 14:54.680]  Mac on a touch bar, but yeah, but I think you're right like it's because you know, it's a different modal kind of you know
[14:55.180 --> 14:57.180]  thing and so
[14:57.180 --> 15:04.740]  When you're switching and you're manually making that decision to go to that tab when it then suddenly has a completely different look and it
[15:04.740 --> 15:10.700]  Doesn't look like what you're expecting and now it's difficult to even ask at least in earlier versions
[15:10.700 --> 15:14.580]  It's gotten a little bit better. But you know, it was a difficult to kind of distinguish like okay, where am I?
[15:15.100 --> 15:19.220]  What am I doing? That's that's not a good user experience. Yeah
[15:19.220 --> 15:27.620]  No, and it just it's just unpleasant, right? Yeah, and it's like in a way that if you
[15:29.180 --> 15:35.780]  Just print out or make a PDF whatever you want if you want to share it digitally
[15:36.380 --> 15:41.460]  Screenshots of the interface and say okay. Here's what it looks like on The New York Times
[15:41.740 --> 15:43.740]  Here's what it looks like on apple.com
[15:44.300 --> 15:46.300]  Here's what it looks like on
[15:46.300 --> 15:50.220]  Google.com if you just look at the screenshots
[15:50.980 --> 15:55.180]  Independently, you're not feeling the experience of oh
[15:55.180 --> 16:01.500]  No, you just switch between tabs and all of a sudden all of this stuff at the top flashes to a different color
[16:01.500 --> 16:05.060]  It's the actual experience where it yeah worse
[16:05.900 --> 16:08.820]  Yeah, like it feels like I'm taking out of what I'm doing
[16:08.820 --> 16:11.980]  like I now I'm focusing on something that I didn't used to have to focus on and
[16:11.980 --> 16:16.300]  That I don't like that. I'm not a fan of that. It's like I'm switching this for a reason
[16:16.540 --> 16:21.900]  Usually because I know what I'm going for. I want to check something. I don't want to immediately have to readjust. Okay
[16:22.260 --> 16:26.940]  Where's my point of reference? Where are my buttons? Where's whatever I need to do? It'd be one thing
[16:26.940 --> 16:32.580]  I think if we didn't have at this point close to 30 years of experience with how like web browser Chrome works
[16:32.580 --> 16:34.860]  but we do so I
[16:35.940 --> 16:38.580]  I'm not a fan. I will say what the
[16:38.580 --> 16:43.740]  Microsoft Edge team is doing with the version of edge that's in Windows 11
[16:43.740 --> 16:47.380]  They take on some of this where if you do if you make a PWA
[16:47.380 --> 16:51.220]  So it's not if you're doing like it's not the standard web browser thing
[16:51.220 --> 16:53.940]  but if you actually create like a progressive web app and either you
[16:54.020 --> 16:58.020]  Want to run that in a tab or you want to run that as like its own contained thing
[16:58.100 --> 17:04.540]  They do have a thing where they can match some of the stuff to a color that you select that the developer can customize
[17:04.540 --> 17:09.620]  it but it doesn't do the thing where it's automatically taking things from the web page and and I
[17:10.140 --> 17:16.340]  Personally prefer that a little bit more but I also feel like that's a different like mental model because again, it's a progressive web app
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.460]  so it's
[17:17.460 --> 17:20.980]  Contained and you are expecting that contained application experience
[17:20.980 --> 17:28.100]  Whereas if I have tabs open I'm expecting a web page and I'm expecting certain user interface elements to be consistent
[17:29.100 --> 17:31.100]  Regardless of what tab I'm looking at
[17:31.100 --> 17:39.140]  it in theory, it sounds good because it sounds like it taking on the color of the
[17:39.300 --> 17:40.300]  web page
[17:40.300 --> 17:45.020]  Gets the chrome even more out of the way. This is the way I've heard from people who?
[17:45.740 --> 17:47.740]  claim to like the
[17:48.420 --> 17:50.860]  WWDC versions of Safari 15
[17:51.020 --> 17:56.820]  They like the idea that hey this it lets the web page be front and center, right?
[17:56.820 --> 18:04.340]  It's immersive, but but I feel like the unexpected outcome of it is it actually draws way more attention to the chrome, right?
[18:04.340 --> 18:06.820]  Like I've never thought more about the top
[18:07.500 --> 18:14.220]  Inch and a half of my Safari windows than when I was running those versions of Safari with that option turned on
[18:15.460 --> 18:16.100]  Yeah, exactly
[18:16.100 --> 18:17.540]  And I have to say you know
[18:17.540 --> 18:20.580]  It's not that difficult for people who are really that bothered by it to either
[18:20.940 --> 18:25.220]  Make the toolbar as minimal as possible or to do things in full screen mode
[18:25.220 --> 18:27.220]  so I don't know I
[18:27.460 --> 18:31.980]  Get why I guess like they would think that it's a good thing makes it more immersive, but I'm with you
[18:31.980 --> 18:39.020]  I think that it just draws more attention to to those elements on the iPhone. I do feel like they have landed
[18:40.500 --> 18:46.300]  It's almost like having a bad flight, you know, like like where you hit a lot of turbulence, you know, and they're like
[18:46.300 --> 18:50.460]  Hey, this is actually dangerous. Definitely. Keep your seatbelt on don't even go to the bathroom and
[18:50.460 --> 18:57.700]  even if you're not a nervous flier your palms are sweaty because you just don't expect the plane to be rocky and
[18:58.100 --> 19:02.860]  It smooths out and you have a nice landing. I feel like that's where they've taken it on the iPhone
[19:03.100 --> 19:07.660]  It is fascinating to me that we saw it play out in public, right?
[19:08.380 --> 19:13.700]  That's the thing that was interesting to me too is we've seen this happen a couple of times. I'm trying to I
[19:14.740 --> 19:17.780]  Got it was it was a number of iOS versions to go
[19:17.780 --> 19:21.860]  There might have been something with 13, but I think that there was something I think it was before iOS 10
[19:21.860 --> 19:26.120]  But there have been a couple instances where we've seen them kind of go back and forth and I remember
[19:26.300 --> 19:32.460]  More than a decade ago. Actually, do you remember when they had the weird tab experiment with the Safari Mac?
[19:32.460 --> 19:37.700]  Yeah, very early very early. Yeah, where they had like the tabs on top similar to Chrome, right?
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.140]  But but it just it didn't work
[19:39.140 --> 19:44.940]  So we've seen this a few times but it is always interesting to me, especially for a company that guards itself
[19:44.940 --> 19:51.380]  I think it would prize itself on being very refined in its public image and being very set in its decisions that it puts out
[19:51.580 --> 19:53.580]  to see these changes in
[19:55.020 --> 20:00.900]  Iterations frankly happening and very clearly based on feedback that they were getting from from users and developers
[20:00.900 --> 20:06.260]  Yeah, the other one that I would think of is in the initial
[20:07.260 --> 20:10.780]  Versions of iOS 7 which was the big chain
[20:10.780 --> 20:18.020]  Yeah, that was the massive change the the big get rid of all the texture and three-dimensional depth and Johnny I've has taken over
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.420]  the by bitch for stall
[20:20.940 --> 20:23.500]  Yeah, but the initial versions had
[20:24.220 --> 20:26.020]  It the flat
[20:26.020 --> 20:28.020]  flattening of everything
[20:28.100 --> 20:34.000]  Was the part that stuck and it took people's attention. I remember mail in particular used these
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  Incredibly thin weights of Helvetica. Noia. Yeah, like just
[20:41.520 --> 20:45.520]  Artistically, you know, it's it's one of the neat things about Helvetica
[20:45.520 --> 20:49.080]  Noia that it has these thin and super fat black weights
[20:49.080 --> 20:55.400]  There's both extra bold weights and extra thin weights, but like you don't want to read your email with with
[20:55.840 --> 20:58.800]  With a font that right? No, you don't because it was so thin
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.200]  No, I remember that there and there were a number of those things. They've kind of made changes
[21:02.200 --> 21:07.080]  There were icons that weren't finalized there were you know certain buttons with that iOS 7
[21:07.760 --> 21:11.520]  Side note. I didn't realize it was Noia. I always thought it was new but that's
[21:12.040 --> 21:14.040]  Noia me. Have you seen the help?
[21:14.040 --> 21:20.920]  This is me me pronouncing a hard-to-pronounce word correctly for the one of the few times ever in the history of this podcast
[21:21.440 --> 21:27.000]  No, I'm really glad to know this because I've been mentally like in my head saying this wrong for however many years
[21:27.360 --> 21:30.240]  Have you seen the the Helvetica variable font?
[21:30.240 --> 21:37.760]  No, I don't think so. It was announced Helvetica now variable monotype just released it and it's basically a variable version
[21:38.480 --> 21:43.040]  Of Helvetica now, I like the idea of variable fonts
[21:43.200 --> 21:46.440]  So that that came out this week or at least I saw it this week
[21:46.440 --> 21:51.440]  So that's kind of cool. If you send me a link, I will I promise to put it in the show notes. I
[21:52.240 --> 21:55.120]  Will I'll put it in I will put it in our shared notes
[21:55.160 --> 21:58.480]  But anyway, long story short Safari 15 is in good shape
[21:58.480 --> 22:05.200]  I think that moving the URL bar to the bottom but attached above the regular toolbar
[22:05.600 --> 22:10.680]  When you need it, and then it just disappears as you scroll is a delightful
[22:11.520 --> 22:18.240]  Solution that takes the best of what Safari was already very good at and adds some very
[22:19.360 --> 22:26.320]  Forward thinking ideas for moving it forward in the era of big phones, which clearly is not going away
[22:26.320 --> 22:29.600]  No, yes, it's clearly not like this is obviously where
[22:30.160 --> 22:35.680]  Things will continue to be I do also like I have to say because at first I was kind of thinking
[22:37.240 --> 22:41.200]  Should this be the default or or what I'm glad they made it the default
[22:41.200 --> 22:43.520]  I'm glad you can switch it if you if you don't like it
[22:43.520 --> 22:46.520]  At least that's how it is in the betas that could potentially change
[22:46.520 --> 22:49.400]  but I do like that they do let you go in the settings and
[22:49.880 --> 22:52.680]  Make that change and sometimes I'm not a fan of that
[22:52.680 --> 22:54.320]  I'm like just make the decision but in this case
[22:54.320 --> 22:58.760]  I think is enough of a difference and enough of a change after you know, so many years that I
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.360]  Appreciate that but I also think like I agree with you. I think it's a good design decision
[23:03.360 --> 23:09.160]  I think it's something that's forward-thinking and will be good for these bigger phones. I am glad I have to say this is one of those
[23:09.160 --> 23:11.160]  times I'm glad I don't have to I'm not a
[23:11.800 --> 23:17.360]  Journalist anymore and I don't have to oversee or assign people in advance to write, you know blogs how to change
[23:17.880 --> 23:20.640]  You know the the the tab
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.560]  At positioning because you know, there will be a million of those
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.680]  What time is the Super Bowl post like literally the second that iOS 15 drops? All right
[23:29.680 --> 23:32.240]  Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at
[23:32.760 --> 23:40.200]  Memberful memberful is the easiest way to sell memberships to your audience and it is used by some of the biggest
[23:40.320 --> 23:45.600]  Creators on the web. Maybe you have an existing membership setup and it's too complicated
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.280]  It's it doesn't do everything you want you want to simplify it
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.120]  you want to get back to just focusing on creating your stuff and
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.280]  Get away from spending all this time and managing the membership system
[23:58.680 --> 24:04.080]  Memberful handles the hard stuff so you can focus on just creating what you want to create
[24:04.400 --> 24:08.560]  The reason you have an audience they have everything you need to run a membership program
[24:08.980 --> 24:13.300]  Including an optimized checkout Apple pay support easy member
[24:13.300 --> 24:20.700]  management dashboard analytics free trials gift subscriptions and more it easily and
[24:21.020 --> 24:27.820]  Seamlessly integrates with the tools you already used including WordPress with lots of managed
[24:27.980 --> 24:30.260]  integrations for other popular services, too
[24:30.260 --> 24:37.600]  And they have a world-class support team that is ready and waiting to help you if you need anything
[24:37.600 --> 24:43.160]  Like hey, I need to do blank just contact their support team. They will help you out
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.560]  And all they want to do is help you grow your revenue from your membership system
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.840]  And you can get started for free with no credit card required
[24:52.840 --> 24:59.580]  All you have to do and here's the special URL. That's the trick to let them know you came here from the talk show
[24:59.580 --> 25:01.320]  Go to memberful
[25:01.320 --> 25:08.680]  Dot-com slash talk show that's a memberful dot-com slash talk show and they'll know you came from the show
[25:08.680 --> 25:10.680]  I recommend them. I'm subscribed to
[25:11.240 --> 25:16.120]  More memberful sites than I can count on my fingers. It's really is a great system
[25:17.720 --> 25:21.460]  Here's a little thing you're a longtime Mac user
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.280]  but also obviously use Windows and you're familiar with other platforms a
[25:26.280 --> 25:33.320]  Little thing about Safari 15 that annoys me I tweeted about it. Haven't written about it on daring fireball
[25:33.320 --> 25:35.840]  But when you go to the tab switcher now
[25:37.040 --> 25:43.880]  The close buttons for the tabs are on the upper right instead of the upper left on iOS. Yeah
[25:44.560 --> 25:45.800]  and
[25:45.800 --> 25:47.800]  It bothers me
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.800]  In a way that it's hard for me to write about it. It feels more like a podcast topic
[25:53.800 --> 25:59.880]  It's easier to talk about but it's to me an idiom that on the Mac close. It's
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.440]  Exactly. It's the reason why Safari's tabs have closed buttons on the Mac
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.520]  on the left exactly
[26:10.280 --> 26:14.520]  Right, whereas every other browser has them on the right but on on Safari
[26:14.520 --> 26:17.740]  It's on the left because that's where the buttons are and that's how it's always been
[26:17.740 --> 26:24.240]  I hadn't thought about that, but you're right. That is a weird. I don't know if I like that to be honest. It's
[26:24.760 --> 26:26.760]  the analogy I'd like to
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.120]  make is to which side of the road do you drive on and
[26:32.600 --> 26:39.240]  In the US we drive on the right side of the road in the UK and a bunch of other countries you drive on the left
[26:39.240 --> 26:41.240]  side of the road I
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.000]  Don't really think one is even better than the other
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  I'm not arguing like like the way that I'll go to the mat for Fahrenheit over Celsius for air temperature
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.200]  I don't have a strong feeling about it
[26:53.920 --> 27:02.040]  But it you you can't just change it willy-nilly like you can't you can't just like cross over the state line
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.320]  From Pennsylvania to New Jersey and then all of a sudden you drive on the other side of the road
[27:07.320 --> 27:10.320]  It breaks your mental model. I think that
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.040]  When I complained about it on Twitter what some people said as well
[27:14.040 --> 27:20.000]  No, I like it because of way more people are right-handed than left-handed. It's what nine out of ten people are right-handed
[27:20.640 --> 27:28.380]  Yeah, and therefore putting the close buttons and the top right makes it easier to hit with your thumb if you're holding it
[27:28.800 --> 27:34.680]  One-handed and it is all of a piece with moving the URL bar to the bottom. It's like
[27:34.680 --> 27:40.360]  I maybe that's what they're thinking. I don't know to me. The idiom is more important than the reachability
[27:41.560 --> 27:43.560]  Yeah, and I think for me
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.160]  I've never thought about the idiom that way but I think I understand we were coming from for me
[27:48.160 --> 27:54.920]  I think again and this is just my own preference because regardless of how I'm using the phone. I'm going to be using it two-handed
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.760]  If anything, I kind of don't mind the fact that it's on the other side
[27:59.760 --> 28:05.560]  I would I would agree that I think for some people for reachability purposes. It probably will make it easier to
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.760]  Scroll through and close things out. Although at the same time like you can just kind of swipe up and or swipe to the side
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.680]  You know, you can use gestures to close things if that's what you need to do. So I
[28:16.840 --> 28:22.640]  Don't know, you know, like it's in since you could just swipe to the side to get rid of a tab
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.860]  I don't know if it is worth changing that idiom as you say
[28:26.860 --> 28:32.860]  It's one of those historical artifacts that I spend way too much time thinking about
[28:33.260 --> 28:38.100]  But the Mac came first then Windows and and I know that you know
[28:38.100 --> 28:43.700]  The Mac came after all the stuff at Xerox that Steve Jobs and his team got to go and look at it
[28:43.700 --> 28:47.940]  wasn't the first graphical user interface, but the Mac was the first one to ship to consumers and
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.540]  Windows was
[28:52.180 --> 28:54.180]  To some degree it
[28:54.180 --> 28:56.180]  Uncontroversial Lee
[28:56.300 --> 29:00.560]  It was their answer to hey, this gooey stuff is a great idea
[29:00.660 --> 29:04.100]  we we should get the PC moving in that direction and
[29:04.540 --> 29:09.540]  Right. I and it was a dosh shell, you know, I mean it was it was honestly it was a solid
[29:09.540 --> 29:16.320]  You know decade before they actually had the first the first version of Windows was literally like a character based thing, you know
[29:17.660 --> 29:22.820]  It's a joke like it's funny, you know, I mean like you 3.0, you know is the first one where you could kind of say
[29:22.820 --> 29:26.140]  Okay, this is this is the direction. It's going in 3.1
[29:26.140 --> 29:31.820]  You never find it, but it was we all be honest was Windows 95 that really introduced new paradigms and I think
[29:32.380 --> 29:35.980]  Actively changed things in Apple famously, you know to the you know
[29:36.340 --> 29:42.540]  Windows 95 welcome to Apple 84 and there's some truth in that right like even though the the teal background was similar
[29:42.540 --> 29:45.700]  There was there was a lot of stuff that they definitely, you know
[29:46.060 --> 29:51.340]  Heavily were influenced by but there were new paradigms to the start menu right-clicking for context
[29:51.340 --> 29:53.660]  You know, there was a lot of stuff that I think you can argue
[29:54.820 --> 30:02.020]  Windows at that point took into its own but yeah Mac it's yes, obviously, you know Xerox PARC predates
[30:02.020 --> 30:08.940]  But the Mac is where this was all born and where I think more than that where all the software that we use was
[30:09.460 --> 30:12.220]  developed and iterated on which then became part of
[30:12.700 --> 30:18.560]  You know the OS is themselves and the part of how we interact with the applications including incidentally
[30:18.560 --> 30:22.680]  Like my favorite app of all time Microsoft Excel, which was a Mac app
[30:23.800 --> 30:28.280]  That's my favorite thing ever. I mean it was a freaking Mac app. It was Mac only for like three years. I
[30:29.160 --> 30:33.960]  So Mike my question and I don't even know if there's anybody left who remembers it
[30:33.960 --> 30:37.680]  My question has always been from the very earliest days of Windows
[30:37.720 --> 30:44.200]  Did they put the close button at the top right instead of the top left just because they were like well
[30:44.200 --> 30:50.200]  Well, we'll get we'll get in trouble. Well, not even trouble but like and I know there was that big hole
[30:50.200 --> 30:51.880]  Yeah, there was ill-conceived
[30:51.880 --> 30:55.100]  look and feel right the the look-and-feel lawsuit, which was
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.640]  which was a waste of time well, and it was incoherent because
[30:59.800 --> 31:03.940]  It's like a lot of political discourse today where it's like Apple was
[31:04.520 --> 31:08.880]  Simultaneously trying to argue that the Mac was vastly better designed than Windows
[31:08.880 --> 31:13.320]  but also that Windows had copied their look and feel right it's like
[31:13.320 --> 31:18.360]  It it doesn't look it didn't look like the Mac. It never quite looked like it
[31:18.360 --> 31:20.640]  It was you know, it was some sort of
[31:21.680 --> 31:28.200]  ham-fisted foot stomping attempt to say we should be the only people with a graphical user interface and which
[31:28.600 --> 31:30.600]  To me is nonsensical, right?
[31:30.920 --> 31:37.680]  100% I mean especially since like it built on as we just said the stuff that they saw from Xerox, right like
[31:37.680 --> 31:42.920]  And and you and even if it hadn't like we should never just have one of anything. But anyway, go on
[31:42.920 --> 31:46.080]  well, it's you shouldn't be able to hold a
[31:47.000 --> 31:52.760]  Broad concept a basic concept that it and and in fact, nobody ever really does right?
[31:52.760 --> 31:56.680]  It's it's not like, you know and look at the way the iPhone
[31:57.280 --> 32:00.200]  And Android have evolved right? It's like oh
[32:00.640 --> 32:04.640]  Should a phone just be a piece of glass with no hardware?
[32:04.640 --> 32:11.720]  Keyboard underneath it and just make the whole as as much of the front surface as you technically can just make it be a touchscreen
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.240]  yes, that's actually a great idea and
[32:15.800 --> 32:17.000]  It was you know
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.640]  The iPhone was first and it it is right and just that once that idea had entered people's heads that that's that's the way
[32:24.640 --> 32:31.620]  All phones have worked since until you know at some point maybe somebody will come up with a better idea, but probably not
[32:31.620 --> 32:36.300]  Right. I mean we have some of the foldable stuff, which I think some of those concepts are interesting
[32:36.300 --> 32:40.660]  And maybe as that gets better and better, we'll see that evolve, but it's still the same basic idea, right?
[32:40.660 --> 32:46.220]  It's like you've got this slab of glass that that is just the screen and that is what you have
[32:46.220 --> 32:46.580]  Yeah
[32:46.580 --> 32:53.460]  I suspect that Microsoft kind of knew Apple might sue and that the look-and-feel lawsuit wasn't
[32:53.700 --> 32:59.540]  Something they didn't anticipate and that they were sort of thinking well, yeah, we should
[32:59.540 --> 33:05.180]  Yeah, I'm sure I'd be I'd be interested to know I'm sure there's still people I don't know if they're still at Microsoft
[33:05.180 --> 33:08.900]  I'm sure there are people who are still around who know that but I'd be curious about that too if they made the decision
[33:09.540 --> 33:11.540]  either
[33:11.540 --> 33:17.940]  Because they were worried about you know, look-and-feel lawsuits or whatever or maybe just because they wanted to differentiate
[33:19.860 --> 33:21.860]  But it's like if
[33:21.860 --> 33:28.180]  It just makes me wonder like was there a meeting where this was decided and if it if the meeting had just gone
[33:28.180 --> 33:34.140]  Slightly differently we'd all have closed button from the top left and and none of this would be a debate
[33:34.300 --> 33:35.980]  But that somebody was like, yeah
[33:35.980 --> 33:39.300]  I think we can really hang our hats on this if we get sued
[33:39.420 --> 33:44.660]  That we can say look if you want to close the window, you got to go to the top right not the top left
[33:44.700 --> 33:47.860]  It's totally different. It's totally different
[33:47.860 --> 33:51.980]  Well, and I be I'd be curious because I I've only used it in VMs
[33:51.980 --> 33:57.220]  I don't know much about it because I mean talk about talking about you know, like disasters like the OS 2 stuff
[33:57.220 --> 34:04.540]  I'm curious how the closed things were on OS 2 if they were on the right or the left like I think would be OS
[34:04.540 --> 34:06.580]  I'm pretty sure it was on the left. Yeah
[34:07.300 --> 34:10.500]  Because they had the tab metaphor, right?
[34:10.500 --> 34:16.900]  that was their original their original idea was that the title bar was only as wide as the
[34:17.300 --> 34:20.360]  The string that the name, you know the name of the window
[34:20.860 --> 34:25.700]  Yeah, now the the Linux distribution Ubuntu they famously
[34:25.700 --> 34:32.540]  Moved I think it was in like 2008 or 2009. This was when so Mark shuttleworth their CEO and founder who?
[34:33.180 --> 34:39.020]  Made a bunch of money in like the dot-com era and and you know has put it into this company
[34:39.780 --> 34:41.220]  and
[34:41.220 --> 34:47.140]  He there was this period of time in like the late aughts where he was very like boisterous about the fact that like
[34:47.500 --> 34:52.340]  Linux on the desktop is gonna out Mac the Mac and everybody laughed and and obviously it was wrong because
[34:52.340 --> 34:56.100]  The year the Linux desktop is never gonna be a thing and you know
[34:56.100 --> 34:57.540]  The closest thing that we have to it
[34:57.540 --> 35:03.380]  I would argue is actually current versions of Windows and the way that they integrate the windows subsystem for Linux
[35:03.380 --> 35:07.260]  But that'll get me hate mail from a whole bunch of other people. So you won't say it
[35:07.580 --> 35:10.260]  Well, I mean I have said and I'll say it again, but you know what?
[35:10.260 --> 35:12.620]  I mean, I won't go on a whole rant about that. But
[35:13.820 --> 35:19.300]  when they were trying to take that on when he was actually investing a lot of money in the desktop experience for Ubuntu which I
[35:19.300 --> 35:22.340]  Think did help move things forward. It didn't make the clusterfuck
[35:22.340 --> 35:30.180]  That is the Linux desktop environment any less of a clusterfuck, but he was they were trying they moved the close buttons to the left and
[35:31.420 --> 35:38.100]  They also had them you to be circular and and they didn't have the same, you know colors of you know, the the
[35:38.780 --> 35:44.300]  Stoplight colors as Mac OS, but they did have you know, these like circular, you know things within their
[35:45.180 --> 35:48.180]  UI frameworks and they put it on the left and people
[35:48.180 --> 35:50.740]  It was mixed. Some people really liked it
[35:50.740 --> 35:54.100]  A lot of people really didn't but it was that way for three or four years
[35:54.100 --> 35:57.900]  I think and then they moved it back to the right which
[35:58.540 --> 36:03.260]  always was surprising to me and and it's so weird because all these years later whenever I
[36:03.780 --> 36:06.840]  Almost exclusively used Linux like through a command line
[36:07.220 --> 36:11.180]  But when I do use, you know some sort of desktop environment or whatever
[36:11.180 --> 36:16.840]  I always have this like a weird thing with Ubuntu where I'm expecting it to be on the left
[36:16.840 --> 36:20.680]  But they've moved it to the right and I'm just like really, you know
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.120]  But that's that was one of those weird ones where they very consciously
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.560]  I think they were maybe trying to capture the Mac audience or I don't know what the rationale was and then
[36:30.800 --> 36:34.360]  Either their own feedback or something else. They were just like nah, and then they moved it
[36:34.520 --> 36:41.600]  It's not a bad goal right if you think like hey the people who really care about user interface are using the Mac
[36:41.600 --> 36:47.160]  We we really want to care about user interface. So we should try to appeal to Mac users
[36:47.280 --> 36:51.920]  That's not a bad idea. And even if it falls short, it's not a bad
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.360]  What would you call it? Like our North Star is yeah. No, it's not bad. No, I don't think it's bad at all
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.960]  There's actually another Linux distro that that I like a lot and I support them
[37:04.840 --> 37:07.480]  Even though it like it's not something I use a lot but it's called elementary
[37:07.480 --> 37:14.640]  It's it's based on Ubuntu but they have their own completely kind of customized user interface, which is very similar to the Mac
[37:14.920 --> 37:21.680]  Although it's original to them and and they also their big thing is like they want their applications in their store to all have a consistent
[37:21.680 --> 37:27.040]  Look and feel which is very much against the ethos of most Linux distributions
[37:27.040 --> 37:32.560]  and so they're trying but they're they have a similar kind of I think North Star where they're
[37:32.560 --> 37:41.080]  Trying to be well-designed and and you know, I don't think that they would say that they're outright like trying to copy or
[37:41.800 --> 37:43.480]  You know be better than the Mac
[37:43.480 --> 37:45.360]  but I think that they look at the Mac is like
[37:45.360 --> 37:51.120]  This is the quality that we would like to in a perfect world aspire to be even if our implementation is different. I
[37:51.960 --> 37:59.200]  I just can't get over thinking that there's a better version of our you know in in the multiverse of universes
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.160]  there's one where Microsoft put the close buttons on the top left and then everyone's in the top left and
[38:05.320 --> 38:09.880]  Nobody ever even thinks about it. You know, you ever thinks about it. Nobody ever thinks about it
[38:10.240 --> 38:14.160]  Although I bet somebody would have like it would probably not be used very often
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.720]  I mean, maybe that would be like the the canoe herd or whatever
[38:17.720 --> 38:21.760]  It was that the installment was trying and failed to do maybe be one of the BSDs, right?
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.520]  Maybe that's what it would be right? Maybe this is it. Maybe this is the the weird universe where
[38:26.520 --> 38:33.520]  Microsoft puts it on the the left and then the BSDs with with whatever
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.840]  X11 thing they're doing they put it on the right and then OS X puts it on the right
[38:39.560 --> 38:45.960]  It's funny, you know and it makes me think about like the early prototype of the aqua interface
[38:46.480 --> 38:50.440]  That they showed where the they put the Apple logo in the middle of the menu. Yes
[38:50.440 --> 38:57.800]  People you you mentioned that to people who weren't like obsessively following like news of Mac OS X
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.200]  circa the year
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.120]  2000 or 1999 or whenever that was and and they'll say what and they'll say oh, yeah
[39:04.120 --> 39:07.680]  they moved the Apple menu to the exact middle of the menu bar and
[39:09.320 --> 39:14.040]  It it was a bad idea it was a bad idea that was one of those things I you know
[39:14.040 --> 39:15.240]  I remember reading about the stuff
[39:15.240 --> 39:17.520]  I obviously didn't using the betas then because I didn't have
[39:17.520 --> 39:22.160]  The ability to really, you know, try to get them or install them on, you know
[39:22.880 --> 39:28.600]  Computers or whatever then but I remember reading about it and being like, huh? That's that's weird
[39:29.160 --> 39:35.720]  I'm glad that they rethought that before maybe that ships, but maybe that comes full circle, you know with the iOS
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.400]  15 version of Safari and the bad ideas with tabs
[39:40.400 --> 39:46.280]  It's like well, sometimes they'll show us bad ideas and we get to see Apple's abandoned ideas
[39:46.280 --> 39:48.280]  Yes
[39:48.880 --> 39:52.320]  Anyway, let me thank our next sponsors our good friends at away
[39:52.720 --> 39:59.760]  Look, whether it's a trip to the corner store or a weekend away or a vacation an extended stay with friends and family
[39:59.840 --> 40:05.800]  We're all navigating the current reality of travel, but no matter your destination or style a ways
[40:06.800 --> 40:13.880]  suitcases bags and accessories all come in a variety of colors sizes and materials to suit your needs and
[40:13.880 --> 40:21.080]  Inspire your future travels all of a way suitcases are designed to last a lifetime with durable
[40:21.400 --> 40:28.400]  Exteriors that can withstand even the roughest of baggage handlers their suitcases come with interior
[40:29.040 --> 40:30.400]  organization systems
[40:30.400 --> 40:38.600]  they include built-in compression pads to help you pack more in in a way that both lets you put more stuff in the suitcase and
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.480]  And keeps like if you put your shirts behind the compression pad and then cinch it up
[40:43.520 --> 40:50.280]  It keeps your shirts from getting wrinkled. It's it really works great. They even include a hidden and
[40:51.080 --> 40:53.680]  Yet also removable laundry bag
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.120]  So when when you travel and you have a bunch of dirty clothes for your trip home
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.940]  But some of the stuff is still clean you there's an entire bag
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.920]  That is meant to be used for this. You can just put your dirty stuff in it. It is great
[41:06.920 --> 41:13.040]  It makes you wonder why that hasn't been part of suitcases for like a hundred years. All the little details are just terrific
[41:13.560 --> 41:21.020]  Great spinner wheels with smooth rolls. I my away suitcases got to be like seven or eight years now
[41:22.400 --> 41:25.200]  It's still it feels brand new as I roll it around
[41:25.920 --> 41:27.720]  different materials
[41:27.720 --> 41:34.480]  Polycarbonate that's like a fancy word for nice plastic, but that's what I've got. It's great, but they also have aluminum. They have durable nylon
[41:34.480 --> 41:42.060]  Terrific selection of colors and here's the thing. They have a hundred day trial on everything that they make
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.200]  Order it get it. Take it out use it
[41:46.200 --> 41:53.260]  And if you're not happy three months later, you can just no questions asked no if answer butts
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.320]  No asterisks, no small print. You just send it back get a full refund
[41:57.320 --> 42:04.240]  They offer free shipping and returns on any order within the contiguous United States
[42:04.460 --> 42:07.020]  also in the UK in Europe and
[42:07.860 --> 42:12.380]  for our friends up north in Canada, so you can start your hundred day free trial and
[42:12.900 --> 42:19.260]  Shop the entire away lineup of travel essentials including their suitcases at away
[42:19.580 --> 42:21.580]  travel comm
[42:21.820 --> 42:24.580]  talk-show that's a way travel comm
[42:25.160 --> 42:26.580]  slash
[42:26.580 --> 42:28.580]  talk-show my thanks to them
[42:29.660 --> 42:32.860]  Some follow-up before we get into the the other stuff
[42:33.700 --> 42:38.760]  Have you have you gotten the magsafe battery pack? I bought it and I returned it
[42:41.580 --> 42:46.900]  Well, it looks like we're not gonna have a debate about this product
[42:48.340 --> 42:50.340]  No, I
[42:50.340 --> 42:55.740]  I really liked Quinn's video on this nasty cute channel. I thought that his review is actually
[42:56.380 --> 43:00.900]  Probably said everything that I would want to say about it. I just I struggle to
[43:01.820 --> 43:03.380]  figure out
[43:03.380 --> 43:09.980]  Why it exists I get the point in it and it's I think like a really compelling idea behind magsafe
[43:09.980 --> 43:12.460]  Which would be like I can just attach this battery and it'll charge it
[43:12.620 --> 43:18.300]  but with the speed in which it charges the fact that you can't charge it itself wirelessly, which is just
[43:18.300 --> 43:24.620]  Well, I do get that I forgive that but it is counterintuitive and I know that was a part of Quinn's video
[43:24.620 --> 43:30.700]  Is that I think it was his wife or somebody who knows yeah, you know got it and and she was like, well
[43:30.700 --> 43:35.780]  How do I charge it? I'll just put it on a charging pad and right now that doesn't that doesn't do anything
[43:35.780 --> 43:41.580]  No, no, I mean I I get why it doesn't work either and I can understand that but it does just feel counterintuitive
[43:41.580 --> 43:46.100]  but I think for me the bigger thing is just it takes so long to kind of provide any juice and
[43:46.100 --> 43:51.420]  You know kind of some of the other trade-offs. I'm like, you know at this point
[43:52.220 --> 43:58.840]  If I if I'm in the position where I need this battery quickly, I don't know if this is going to actually
[43:59.620 --> 44:01.420]  Provide what I need
[44:01.420 --> 44:05.780]  Other than offering, you know bulk and and even though it sticks on pretty well
[44:05.780 --> 44:08.060]  I'm still gonna kind of be worried like does this thing fall off?
[44:08.580 --> 44:14.060]  versus can I just have a smaller battery pack, you know in my bag anyway, if that's what I need I just
[44:14.060 --> 44:19.000]  With the price and with with the kind of the performance and other stuff. It's just like I can't justify this
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.180]  it's a hundred bucks, which is a lot and I
[44:24.700 --> 44:28.120]  It's another thing that to me it is a
[44:29.740 --> 44:31.220]  Maybe I'm just
[44:31.220 --> 44:38.740]  Have this thought in mind, but it's a lot like the initial versions of Safari 15 where it's like this sounds like a great idea
[44:38.740 --> 44:44.900]  But you evaluate the actual thing and it's like it doesn't really work out
[44:44.900 --> 44:51.780]  it sounds great that you just have this thing that you can magnetically attach to the back of your phone and let's say a
[44:52.380 --> 44:58.500]  Super common case for me is when I'm on vacation. I was with friends a couple weeks ago
[44:59.260 --> 45:01.260]  Took, you know
[45:01.260 --> 45:04.620]  Normal day. I might not take any photos, but I'm on vacation
[45:04.620 --> 45:11.700]  I take tons of photos and I shoot lots of video and I have my phone set to shoot in 4k, you know and which
[45:12.140 --> 45:13.580]  actually
[45:13.580 --> 45:20.300]  Consumes a lot of battery, you know, like it's as a phone reviewer. I still don't know a better way
[45:20.300 --> 45:24.780]  It's a the weird world of being a reviewer is sometimes you want to test
[45:24.780 --> 45:29.780]  Hey, how long does this new charger take to charge a fully depleted iPhone?
[45:29.780 --> 45:35.220]  Well, how do you deplete the iPhone the best way? No, that's always the thing. Yeah for you. It's recording video
[45:35.220 --> 45:40.660]  Yeah, it's 4k shoot set your phone to record 4k 60 and just put it in the corner
[45:41.140 --> 45:45.660]  You know shoot it out a window or something like that and just it
[45:46.020 --> 45:48.220]  If there's a better way to run down a phone
[45:48.220 --> 45:54.840]  I don't know because the phone won't go to sleep while it's recording video and shooting 4k 60, you know
[45:55.580 --> 45:57.980]  Runs it down as fast as anything I can think of
[45:57.980 --> 46:04.180]  So, yeah, it sounds great. You just take this pack and and I use battery packs. I've always been obsessed with them
[46:04.180 --> 46:09.220]  I have a whole half of my office is filled with with iPhone battery packs
[46:10.140 --> 46:14.260]  And it sounds great. You don't have to worry about having a little cable and
[46:14.900 --> 46:21.380]  You know one of the things I like with a battery pack is to have a very short cable because I do you know for years
[46:21.380 --> 46:26.340]  I like to if I could just put it in my pocket while I'm charging midday to
[46:26.340 --> 46:31.060]  Juice up the phone in in the middle of a day while I'm away from any kind of wall socket
[46:31.060 --> 46:35.820]  I don't want even a three-foot cable or an 18-inch cable. I want like a little like
[46:36.420 --> 46:42.740]  Four-inch cable so that it's you know, I don't have a cable sticking out of my pocket. Well magsafe sounds perfect, right?
[46:42.740 --> 46:47.540]  There's no cable at all. It seems it seems great and that's kind of what I was hoping for and then
[46:48.260 --> 46:53.620]  My experience was it just it really didn't live up it it charges so slowly
[46:53.620 --> 46:58.740]  It charges so slowly it way more slowly than magsafe
[46:59.980 --> 47:01.980]  Connected to a wall socket, right?
[47:02.460 --> 47:09.220]  It it just to me in in practice and in real life over the last few weeks
[47:09.220 --> 47:15.020]  It really seems not to charge your iPhone in practice. It kind of just keeps your iPhone where it is
[47:15.020 --> 47:17.020]  So let's say your iPhone's at 30%
[47:17.020 --> 47:23.140]  Put the magsafe pack on put it in your pocket and use your phone. Normally your phone just stays at 30%
[47:23.140 --> 47:29.180]  And I if you really take it out never use it just set it aside. It will charge your phone
[47:29.180 --> 47:33.860]  I'm not claiming that it doesn't make your phone go to 31 32 33
[47:34.140 --> 47:41.820]  But I'm saying in real life using your phone as it's connected to this battery pack. It just kind of floats it treads water
[47:41.820 --> 47:45.780]  Yeah, no, which is which is interestingly I think similar
[47:45.780 --> 47:50.380]  Although obviously it's more slowly, but that it reminded me of the first iPhone battery case
[47:51.060 --> 47:56.620]  they came out within like in 2015 or 2016 because that was a similar thing where you know, it was a
[47:57.860 --> 48:03.100]  Smaller capacity than the mophie cases and whatnot at the time, but it obviously had a better pass-through and whatnot
[48:03.260 --> 48:08.060]  But I remember that having the similar situation. I was like, okay this charges
[48:08.580 --> 48:13.020]  But really this is kind of about kind of maintaining and maybe using you know
[48:13.020 --> 48:18.220]  the the excess battery if that's what you needed it to write like but that was kind of like I think the way that it
[48:18.220 --> 48:21.860]  Was kind of position was not so much that this is now charging your phone
[48:22.300 --> 48:28.340]  But you're you know using some of the juice from this case and and your phone is able to be
[48:28.820 --> 48:31.060]  Like at whatever it's its level was
[48:32.580 --> 48:37.860]  And I think you're right like it's it's I guess maybe useful if you're in a scenario where you're like, okay
[48:37.860 --> 48:40.900]  I for whatever reason cannot have a small battery pack and
[48:40.900 --> 48:47.860]  Look, you can find more higher capacity battery packs that are smaller or take up at the very least the same amount of room
[48:47.860 --> 48:49.860]  That the the mag safe
[48:49.860 --> 48:55.060]  Charger does yes, you'll need a cable, but you can get a small one for that too. But it's just like
[48:55.740 --> 48:59.900]  How slow it is and how little you get from it for me?
[49:00.420 --> 49:05.820]  Especially since the the way that the the magnets work, you know, it is one of those things where if you've got a case on it
[49:06.100 --> 49:10.300]  It's a pretty good grip, but it's still not one of those things where you know
[49:10.300 --> 49:15.460]  I would feel totally confident and in its strength where for me I'm kind of like yeah
[49:15.460 --> 49:20.200]  This is not going to replace a normal battery pack that I already am at this point
[49:20.460 --> 49:23.920]  Conditioned to having in my purse or my my backpack or whatever
[49:24.220 --> 49:27.940]  When I'm going to the beach or out with friends and I know I'm going to need to plug in
[49:28.460 --> 49:34.780]  Especially since in that situation I usually have like I've got like a USB C like fast charge battery
[49:34.780 --> 49:40.500]  Where I can use, you know, the USB C to lightning cable and I can juice up my iPhone
[49:41.380 --> 49:43.260]  real quick and
[49:43.260 --> 49:46.980]  And not have to kind of feel like I have to baby it or or whatever
[49:48.460 --> 49:53.820]  And the other thing I've noticed in real life is it it gets warm enough
[49:54.540 --> 50:01.900]  Mm-hmm, not unpleasant, but like hot but warm enough though that you can just feel how
[50:01.900 --> 50:06.060]  inefficient it is because you know that all of that heat is
[50:07.180 --> 50:13.500]  Wasted energy, right? Right, and I noticed this the equipment since in his video, but I actually noticed this too
[50:14.220 --> 50:20.640]  When I was outdoors with it, and this was kind of the thing that really killed it for me when I was outdoors with it
[50:21.420 --> 50:24.260]  the screen dimmed when it was connected and
[50:24.860 --> 50:31.020]  If you know, I tried to kind of raise, you know that then it started to get really hot and for me
[50:31.020 --> 50:31.900]  I was just kind of like, okay
[50:31.900 --> 50:32.060]  well
[50:32.060 --> 50:38.900]  this is useless and it seemed to actually work more poorly outdoors than it did indoors and for me most of the
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.620]  situations where I'm going to be using a battery pack are going to be situations where I'm outdoors and
[50:44.100 --> 50:47.460]  So and and I'm in Seattle where it's hardly I mean, it's sunny
[50:47.460 --> 50:51.500]  I guess you know in the summer, but it's not like the sun hits place on earth or anything
[50:51.620 --> 50:57.620]  But I can imagine you know, if I'm at the beach where it's hot anyway and where already you have issues, you know with
[50:57.620 --> 51:00.860]  You know keeping the battery from from overheating and whatnot
[51:00.860 --> 51:03.940]  But if you're already in that scenario, like I'm going to LA in a couple of weeks
[51:03.940 --> 51:10.660]  I could be like, yeah, if I'm at a concert and I've got this thing on and it's hot out and then this is hot and
[51:11.420 --> 51:17.140]  And the you know feels like the iPhone is overheating like this is just probably not gonna even give me any net power
[51:17.180 --> 51:17.700]  Yeah
[51:17.700 --> 51:24.300]  I so I've I've come full circle and I would encourage anybody who's vaguely interested in a mag safe
[51:24.300 --> 51:29.500]  Portable battery pack to buy the anchor one, which is 50 bucks. Yeah, and
[51:30.820 --> 51:38.540]  also, if you've really if the whole thing you really want to do and no matter what you and I have just said about how
[51:38.540 --> 51:44.220]  It's not that great magnetically if you really want to just use a portable battery pack
[51:44.980 --> 51:49.400]  Magnetically with no cable. The Apple one is better than anchors in my
[51:49.400 --> 51:54.880]  But the anchor one to me is a better product and even price aside
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.020]  But it is double the price you could buy two of them, you know, it's literally half the price
[51:59.400 --> 52:06.360]  But it works as a regular old-fashioned the whole thing battery thing which to me
[52:06.360 --> 52:08.420]  I think is is what what steals it for me?
[52:08.420 --> 52:09.440]  They could be the same price
[52:09.440 --> 52:16.200]  I would still prefer the anchor one because you still have that ability to quickly charge it and then then the benefit
[52:16.200 --> 52:23.000]  well, then why even get it instead of a non magnetic one is that when you're traveling you could use the anchor one as like
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.760]  Your portable hotel nightstand phone charger and you charge both products up
[52:28.880 --> 52:35.200]  just plug one USB C cable into the anchor charger your phone will snap on to it and it'll
[52:35.320 --> 52:42.200]  Both will charge overnight and then during the day if you want to top off your phone with your portable battery pack
[52:42.200 --> 52:48.480]  Just use a cable and you'll get you'll charge so much faster and you want it won't get hot
[52:48.680 --> 52:53.240]  15 minutes and you you know, you could pick up, you know an extra 10% or something like that and
[52:53.800 --> 52:55.800]  You're good to go
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.720]  Yeah, I agree with that I would I haven't
[53:00.920 --> 53:02.100]  Purchased the anchor one
[53:02.100 --> 53:03.800]  But if I were going to get another one
[53:03.800 --> 53:08.840]  That's totally what I would do because then I feel like you get the best of what you would want the mag safe for
[53:08.840 --> 53:16.120]  With the the wireless charging and the fact that it can also be a standard, you know power bank
[53:17.760 --> 53:23.440]  So my advice would be to anybody out there who already owns a portable battery pack that's not magnetic at all. You're good
[53:23.440 --> 53:24.880]  Just keep it. That's fine
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.720]  And if you really want one to like simplify your travel gear
[53:30.080 --> 53:33.000]  Maybe consider the anchor one as as a dual
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.600]  both a pocketable portable charger and a
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.240]  Pretty nice bedside mag safe charger overnight. Yeah
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.840]  So and they also they make it in green and purple which is nice because I'm looking at the purple one
[53:49.240 --> 53:54.440]  That might well who knows when travel will return but that wouldn't be a bad thing to keep in my travel bag to be honest
[53:54.440 --> 53:59.040]  I like the hotel idea right similar to the way I travel with a fire stick 4k
[53:59.040 --> 54:06.120]  I could I could have that in there. Yeah. Yeah, so you just you carry that just to plug into a hotel TV to
[54:06.680 --> 54:08.680]  100% yeah, yeah, and
[54:09.080 --> 54:13.080]  And I like it because it has a VPN on it so I can if I'm in another country I can access
[54:13.080 --> 54:19.480]  You know the the content that I want to access and and the advantage over, you know a it's smaller than an Apple TV
[54:19.480 --> 54:22.640]  But the big advantage is that it works with captive networks
[54:22.840 --> 54:28.260]  So if you're on the hotel Wi-Fi, you can still get on that Wi-Fi
[54:28.260 --> 54:33.540]  You don't have to you know, do the weird, you know, like creating a router thing, you know
[54:33.540 --> 54:35.720]  Which is just that that's a that's a non-starter
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.720]  So that's a and it was like $30 or something when I got it. It was on sale from Prime Day
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.440]  This was a couple years ago and it's it's very good. Plus it has the Apple TV app
[54:44.480 --> 54:51.240]  So I have my whole library of everything. So yeah, literally it stays in my bag because it's my travel thing
[54:51.720 --> 54:57.440]  The other charger related thing I wanted to talk to you about and again, it's maybe it's my fault
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.120]  Maybe I should seek out
[54:59.120 --> 55:01.120]  Guess who disagree with me?
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.640]  But I wanted to talk about the you and I had a brief exchange on Twitter and I was like, amen
[55:07.160 --> 55:09.160]  Christina on
[55:09.200 --> 55:10.640]  the
[55:10.640 --> 55:18.080]  Hey, we're not gonna put chargers in the box anymore. And now, you know Apple went first and yep
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.740]  I'm still I am a fan of getting rid of the headphone jacks. I think headphone jacks
[55:24.440 --> 55:26.440]  are old and
[55:26.440 --> 55:29.720]  We're due to be and I there are trade-offs
[55:29.720 --> 55:35.480]  There are times when you kind of do wish to have the simplest analog thing possible
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.120]  but I think all things considered the trade-offs are on the side of getting rid of headphone jacks and
[55:40.920 --> 55:42.680]  The world isn't going back
[55:42.680 --> 55:50.360]  I feel that Apple leading the way on we're not even going to put a charger in the box because yay environment
[55:50.840 --> 55:54.180]  Is true right? It is true. The boxes are smaller
[55:54.180 --> 55:58.660]  You don't need an entire drawer full of chargers
[55:59.220 --> 56:05.860]  But I kind of feel like the trade-offs just aren't worth it. Yeah, I agree and and I'm just mad
[56:06.620 --> 56:08.980]  Okay, going back to the mag safe battery pack thing, right?
[56:09.560 --> 56:10.140]  Okay
[56:10.140 --> 56:12.100]  So this is this is a hundred dollar
[56:12.100 --> 56:17.660]  Battery pack that as we've discussed is not as good as the one that is half the price from anchor
[56:17.700 --> 56:22.100]  Okay, and the anchor one I guarantee you there's still some sort of markup on that
[56:22.100 --> 56:25.300]  It's not as high as apples, but I guarantee you there's some sort of markup on it
[56:25.380 --> 56:30.620]  So Apple is is making I don't even know how much money off of that hundred dollar battery pack
[56:30.620 --> 56:33.540]  but it's probably 90% margin I would guess right and
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.620]  They don't include a cable in the box. They also don't include the power brick
[56:38.820 --> 56:41.920]  So if you want to actually charge your mag safe
[56:42.860 --> 56:45.780]  It is a charger. It right is a charger
[56:45.780 --> 56:47.700]  So if you want to actually juice that back up again
[56:47.700 --> 56:52.140]  And let's say that you have bought an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro or 12 mini. I
[56:53.340 --> 56:55.340]  that didn't come with the charger either and
[56:55.940 --> 57:00.840]  The way to charge this battery you need this 20 watt or 18 watt charger or whatever
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.460]  That's another 30 bucks. And then you also need a cable to go with it
[57:04.460 --> 57:07.520]  Now you probably have one of those but that's that's another 20
[57:08.220 --> 57:11.420]  it's just it's the nickel and diming and I also feel like
[57:12.460 --> 57:16.380]  And this was kind of my my point in like my Twitter random and I've done this a couple times
[57:16.380 --> 57:23.600]  You know, it was one thing and I know that many of us do have tons and tons of old adapters. I get that
[57:24.300 --> 57:27.280]  But the thing is is that finally we're at the point where?
[57:27.560 --> 57:34.200]  We have fast charging and where the phones are big enough and powerful enough that they need higher capacity charging bricks
[57:34.200 --> 57:37.880]  So those those tiny ones are not going to do it very quickly and or efficiently
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.560]  so
[57:39.560 --> 57:41.560]  You're basically telling people. Yeah
[57:41.680 --> 57:45.600]  Thanks for buying this $1,500 phone that we're super super excited about you can get this high
[57:45.600 --> 57:51.240]  You know fast, you know charger stuff, but we're not gonna include one in the box the one that you've got also
[57:51.240 --> 57:56.800]  Oh, this is the funny thing to the cable that we do include in the box will not work with your old charger
[57:57.120 --> 57:59.200]  All right, like your old charging brick, right?
[57:59.960 --> 58:06.800]  Right because the the one in the box now has USB C and all the chargers are USB USB a so
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.200]  Like to me that's that's just shitty because in I think you're you're at that point you were basically telling someone
[58:13.200 --> 58:16.720]  Yeah, you're gonna either need to continue to use an old cable
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.640]  Which one of the best things about getting a new phone is getting a new cable it might you know
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.040]  Because the the Apple cables suck I buy anchor ones and some other brands, but you know, we all know that they fall apart
[58:28.080 --> 58:30.160]  We've all had that experience happen
[58:30.160 --> 58:33.840]  And even if they were the highest quality cable after a year of constant use like I don't know
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.280]  It's one of my favorite parts of getting a new phone
[58:35.280 --> 58:39.440]  I know I'm gonna get a brand new cable and I'm like good. This is gonna be a good one
[58:39.440 --> 58:45.120]  It's gonna be like one that charges well and and it doesn't you know, like stop working because it's bent a certain way
[58:45.120 --> 58:48.680]  And and it doesn't fray and it's gonna shock me or whatever. So
[58:49.340 --> 58:51.100]  You either have to buy a new you know
[58:51.100 --> 58:54.520]  Use use your old grimy cable or you have to buy another brick anyway
[58:54.520 --> 58:58.320]  And to your point what most people are going to do is they're gonna balk at spending
[58:58.440 --> 59:04.100]  $30 on a charging brick as they should because it's obscene and they're gonna buy a crappy one
[59:04.640 --> 59:06.920]  Which is not going to work as well
[59:06.920 --> 59:11.080]  so I just and you're paying $1,500 for a phone in some cases, it's just
[59:11.880 --> 59:18.500]  Yeah, I do feel that the your point about the MagSafe pack not including a charger
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.800]  It would make sense if the phone still had a charger, right?
[59:23.800 --> 59:24.720]  Because yeah
[59:24.720 --> 59:32.000]  Then the argument would be the only purpose of owning this this MagSafe battery pack is if you own an iPhone
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.200]  12 and
[59:34.200 --> 59:41.760]  if you own an iPhone 12 you already have a charger that would charge in in the theoretical world where the iPhone 12 came with
[59:41.760 --> 59:43.040]  a good charger
[59:43.040 --> 59:47.440]  You already have a charger so you don't need another one and I could see that sure
[59:47.440 --> 59:52.960]  but if neither has a charger and then it feels like a ripoff and I
[59:53.340 --> 59:56.640]  really do I wonder like what the
[59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.960]  typical person buys like what is the or
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.960]  Even the a typical like what is the less than average charger, right?
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960]  It's like the old George Carlin bit that hey
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.960]  If you ever think you know
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:17.320]  If you ever get upset about how stupid the average person is think about the fact that half of the people are dumber than than
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.720]  that guy
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:26.340]  It's like if the average charger that people buy is not that great. What's what is the 25th percentile, right?
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.160]  Yeah, I mean, I'm guessing in a lot of cases
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.640]  It's people are either using what they have around they might be using an old thing that came with an old Android phone or that
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.240]  Came with like a fire tablet or a Kindle or something, you know
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.240]  And in some cases it comes down to because I'm thinking about my sister in this case
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.080]  She's somebody who always loses her cables and whatnot. And so she actually ironically I think uses a
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.560]  Battery pack that is then plugged into the wall and then she has the charging cable coming out of that
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.760]  Which you know is like a ridiculous thing, but but in that case, it's okay
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.960]  And then I think about people like my dad who I've had to order
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.720]  You know charging stuff for before because he's misplaced things and and he buys a new phone maybe every five years
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.480]  And so they do not have they are not me
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.240]  They do not have a million gan chargers and and other things all over the place
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.440]  Like I'm a typical and so I'm not mad for me. Like I'm fine
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:24.080]  I'm mad for normal people who don't have this stuff and then have to go to Walmart or the gas station
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.440]  Or or Best Buy and then get you know suckered into they see the $30 thing and they're like, I'm not doing that
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.800]  I'm gonna get this $10 one and
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.760]  Look, there might be some good $10 ones out there, right?
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.640]  Like if you get one from anchor or somebody else, but there are plenty of Chinese knockoff ones that you don't know where they're from
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.640]  Actually, you know what it probably is John and this is the scariest part
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.360]  It is probably people buying stuff off of Amazon
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:55.040]  that looks like the Apple chargers and that are the fake ones that that Apple has spent so much time trying to shut down that we
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.800]  Know when people take them apart are dangerous and don't follow specifications and are just bad
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.040]  Honestly, that's probably what most of them are. Is there the counterfeit Apple chargers?
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:12.200]  I think and I think that the common person's intuitive sense is wrong, which is intuitively I
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:18.200]  I think that people think well if it charges my phone at all, then that's fine that that's it
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:24.560]  It either works or it doesn't and if it works then my phone gets charged and that's it and they don't really think about
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.440]  How fast it is how efficient it is. Is it even safe?
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.040]  you know and you don't see I'm not trying to claim that there are stories about people whose houses burned down because they bought a
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.760]  Cheap charger off Amazon. It doesn't seem to be a problem. It seems, you know overall
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.640]  It's all fairly safe. But in terms of efficiency, there are big big differences
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.120]  there really are and you know, it's not I'm not trying to say that Apple's prices are
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.080]  you know, I
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.160]  I don't think that the magsafe thing has 90% margins like you said
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.840]  But I'm sure it has high margins and I think that Apple's what do they cost?
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.640]  Like the regular ones are like 30 bucks, right? It's yeah, you know, they're making some money on that
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.160]  I think the anchor ones are probably a pretty good idea of hey
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:17.240]  This is a healthy profitable business selling things for a profit and with very safely engineered
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.240]  Well-designed chargers. I think that's probably a fair price and if you're paying less
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:28.060]  Probably isn't and I think it's less about safety and probably more about efficiency. It's surprising to me
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:34.320]  I always said this like when people gave Apple a very hard time for years that the that the charger they did include
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.080]  Was the little 5 watt charger?
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.080]  Just how many people preferred that charger because of the size
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.280]  Right, right. And and that was kind of another thing that I that frustrates me
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.960]  We are finally at the point where the Gann chargers are small enough and are available and are actually fairly inexpensive
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.000]  So these companies if they wanted to it would cost them a few dollars more
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.520]  They could certainly pass the price on to the consumer if they wanted to
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:08.200]  But it would cost them a couple of dollars more they could include a Gann charger in the box
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.880]  that is still that same size and and is the same efficiency they don't and
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.960]  Instead, you know the argument is that it's about the environment and that's bullshit
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.800]  It's not about the environment at all because this was I remember this
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.580]  A friend of mine on Twitter when this happened in September and I was ranting about this for the first time
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:35.820]  He when he ordered his his iPhone through Apple through like his business account
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:41.780]  He got an email from the Apple salesperson saying hey, we just noticed that you didn't have you know
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.380]  A charger cable attached to your order, you know, the new ones don't come with it
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.060]  So I can go ahead and price this for you if you want
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:55.700]  So don't tell me that this is a green initiative when your salespeople are already looking at this as an opportunity to upsell
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:03.420]  the one environmental thing I could maybe see the argument with is that it does mean the box is now smaller and
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.780]  So you can have a more more volume
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.060]  iPhones in a shipping container, okay granted
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.820]  But again, I don't think that the impetus there is it all about the environment?
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.700]  It's all about saving Apple money and Samsung money and Google money and whoever else money on
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:25.020]  Shipping freight like if they don't care about the environmental impact
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.700]  That that skipping the charger is going to have it if they did
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.500]  I mean, I think that you could make an argument that including the higher
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:36.260]  Like quality, you know longer-lasting Gann charger. That's a higher capacity
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:43.100]  Would mean that people wouldn't have to continue buying for their other devices because it's not like the iPhone is the only
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.220]  USB, you know power brick that we use that you could be like, hey
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.780]  I don't have to buy a bunch of these I can just use my iPhone brick with these other things too. I
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:58.300]  Don't know. I remember as a kid. I don't remember which car I think it was. My mom had a Plymouth Horizon
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.420]  Remember it this might be before your time the Plymouth Horizon
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:08.180]  I forget the Dodge version the dot Dodge Omni was the exact same car but
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:13.940]  Plymouth and Dodge were like two divisions of Chrysler. It was sort of like a Volkswagen rabbit
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:20.800]  It was a hatchback but not even a station wagon size sort of a compact hatchback car and it it had
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.480]  Paper floor mats paper literally just paper
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.600]  Because it was a you know, like a very low-cost car. It was probably like the cheapest card
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.160]  that Plymouth made and
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.480]  You know, my mom didn't drive long distances
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:41.280]  They wanted to buy a cheap car but wanted a new car and I remember as a little kid
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.540]  they got paper floor mats because they the real floor mats were extra and my parents like
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:51.000]  I will just we'll buy floor mats on our own at a store and they did you know
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.920]  My parents did buy floor mats for the car
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.480]  But they didn't get the ones from Plymouth because they were so expensive and it's like, okay
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.520]  It was though. I remember as just it's a sort of thing. It's you know, it
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.480]  Informed my entire life right that I just noticed things like that and thought I
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:16.160]  Get it that that I knew as a kid. This is not like an expensive car. This isn't a luxury car
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.200]  You know
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.680]  But it is a new car and it was exciting and fun that we had a new car and it had a new car
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:29.060]  Smell, it felt so cheap that they that they like let my parents drive off the lot with
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:35.680]  Literally paper floor mats that and they even had like a bad logo on it, you know, like the Plymouth logo
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.360]  It's like but I kind of get it for a low-cost car
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:46.000]  But it's like totally Mercedes is not going to let you drive off the lot with paper for you, right? Thank you
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.640]  And that's the thing. That's Apple, right? Yes
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:54.940]  That's the thing. It's like I'm sorry, but there is a part of me that gets frustrated that I'm spending again
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:01.400]  $1,500 once taxed and an Apple care and whatever is involved and I don't even buy the the 512 phone. I buy the 256
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.920]  But it's a $1,500 phone, you know to get the the pro max right or whatever
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.480]  That's more than a laptop. It's a lot of that
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.840]  That's a lot of money and and you know that that's that's for many people gonna be the most expensive
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.920]  Electronic that they buy over the years, right?
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:24.720]  Oh without question and any anything that compares to it would be something that they would keep for far longer
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.560]  Like if they're gonna percent by like a new home stereo setup you get your home audio setup
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.920]  And maybe you spend more than $1,500. So although probably not honestly. No, honestly, probably not and so at this point
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.400]  Yeah, so I'm spending this much money on this and you can't even include the charger. I
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.560]  Like I I think what they should do
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:51.040]  I think what Apple should do is that they should make it when you buy a new iPhone if you would like
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:59.680]  Have the checkbox off by default, but if you check the box then they'll include a free charger and cable
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.160]  You know in their own boxes
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:07.720]  So if you don't need it, you don't have to check it and you you you just get your slim iPhone box
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.480]  That is truly it is a lot. It's it's half the size the box
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.280]  Which is great. And and so no, I think that that's a great solution. I like that. I also like apparently
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.280]  Roku offers a way to get an HDMI extender
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.920]  For free from their website and they just have an easy page
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.040]  so if you need that you just go to the page and and you fill out a form and they send it to you like
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.080]  If you I like your approach better, like I think like when you order it
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.000]  It's off by default, but you can check a box to get the the you know brick if that's what you need
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.820]  I would I would not take the box. I would not take the charger. I have I have enough chargers
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.360]  yeah, and at this point I may or I may not it would depend on what charger it is right because
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.960]  Like honestly, so if it's gonna be the 18-month, maybe I would but maybe I wouldn't right. I
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.880]  I am I sold my my friend because I forgot to send mine back as part of the you know trading program or whatever
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.920]  That happened sometimes where I was just like, oh I forgot to mail the phone back in
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.760]  And so I paid the full price and then you know bought the new phone
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.040]  so I still had my iPhone 11 Pro Max and
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.960]  We found out that a friend of mine was she still had an iPhone 8 and it was broken
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.120]  It was busted and a mutual friend of ours sent me a photo of her phone and she was appalled
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:30.200]  And I was like, I'll take care of this. And so I sold her my iPhone Pro 11 max for
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.800]  The same price that Apple was going to give me to trade it in like like five hundred fifty dollars
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.280]  So she got a really good deal on on a very high-end phone, right?
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.120]  relatively recent
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.040]  Relatively recent very high upgrades very high and big upgrade from what she had before
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.480]  Well when I mailed it to her, you know
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.040]  I had the box and I opened it up and and the chargers there and I'm like
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.960]  there was the thing there was a part of me where I was like, I'll just include the charger and then I was like
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.720]  No, I don't have at least from the Apple branded ones. Like I have a lot of Gann chargers and stuff
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.760]  I was like, this is this is the this is the good one, right? Like I didn't get one with my iPhone 12
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.080]  So sorry Allison, I I ganked your your charger
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.400]  but you know, but like I had kind of that kind of like a thing where I was like I
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:24.360]  I again for the travel bag because you don't know there are there times when you need a good USB plug that has high power and
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.480]  You know, I don't have a ton of those. I
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.760]  Recently got some some stackable Gann chargers that I like a lot
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.360]  But again, like it's just one of those things to just have in the in the bag to always have for emergencies
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.760]  So I may or I may not get it
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.200]  But I like that idea a lot of being able to choose probably next time I probably wouldn't get it
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.280]  I think the alternative if you didn't want to do that would be to include in the box
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.840]  If you needed to get one, you know have a coupon or something that you could redeem at the Apple Store or on the Apple Store
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.280]  Website. Yeah, I'm not saying that anybody should any time of the day should be able to stroll into the Apple Store
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.240]  Yeah, just raise your hand and say give me I'm not saying that either
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.440]  I mean, I think like you would need to have like the coupon tied to your phone
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.400]  But yeah one for one with the purchase of a new phone because they're their cheapest phone
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.400]  The iPhone SE is 400 bucks, which is still that $400 for an electronic gizmo
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.120]  No, exactly. And it's high-end it is and think about this way like
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.920]  $400 is more than a lot of Chromebooks. Can you imagine a Chromebook not coming with a charger?
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:36.200]  Paper formats Christina paper for us. We were talking before about how people are using their phones increasingly as their primary computing thing
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.140]  Which is true. Can you imagine buying even an iPad and and like the lowest in iPad?
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.380]  You know cost about the same as as the lowest in iPhone SE
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.380]  The iPad comes with the charger
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.220]  So why do you think that is?
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.960]  Do you think they're gonna get rid of the charger with the iPads or the iPad will always keep the charger?
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.160]  I don't know. I wonder how much I guess maybe density they'd be able to shrink from the box if they got rid of it
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:08.560]  And if they needed other things like I don't know in theory an iPad box could be
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.640]  Extremely thin it could be true. It could be like the shape and size of the
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.440]  The box the case that the keyboard comes in. Yeah, right. Yeah. No, you're right. It could I wonder sometimes
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.800]  if maybe they have more to it just so they can have like more like
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.680]  support, you know
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:32.520]  Because you remember when the iPad Pro that the 11 and the 12 inch at the ones the most recent redesign
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.800]  When that came out a few years ago
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.080]  There were people with the 11 inch models who were like bent out of the box because it's so thin
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.800]  Yeah, so I wonder if that's one of those things where they're like, okay, we don't want it too thin
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.400]  We need to have some sort of you know protection
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.800]  So we might as well stick a charger
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.840]  So we might as well still have the charger, but that's a good question. Like I think and I and the only
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.680]  the only other rationale I could come up with would be
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:05.440]  That they see the iPad as a computer and even Apple knows that there is no possible way
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.880]  You can sell a computer without a charger and not have people revolt, right? I
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.800]  Think that maybe where the iPhone suffers
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.940]  That the sort of bean-counting mentality of we can double our shipping
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:23.640]  I mean there is an environmental advantage to shipping the iPhone in a smaller box
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.520]  But also it is yes far more profitable you put twice as many iPhones on the same boat coming over from China
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.960]  I think where the iPhone suffers is that you can
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.720]  Live day to day and not be too annoyed using a 5 watt charger with an iPhone
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.840]  yeah, right and it's like because most people charge overnight and they go through the day and
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:54.880]  Most people get through every day all days with without their phone iPhone running out of battery
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:02.960]  So five watts is fine. Five watts is not going to work to charge an iPad and it certainly is not a I don't even know
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.360]  I don't even know what happens if you charge try to charge like a MacBook Air with a file
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.400]  I don't think it'll power. Yeah, I don't I don't think it'll even power on so I feel like that's that's where the iPhone gets hurt
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.760]  Is well if people are left to their own choices and they just use their old
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.840]  5-watt charger because they have one already or they have a couple because they bought a couple iPhones before or they just go to the
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.220]  Gas station or the corner store and just buy whatever they have behind the counter for 10 bucks
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.880]  Which is probably a 5 watt charger. Yeah, well that that they'll be fine
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:41.640]  Whereas I don't think you can get away with that if they ship the iPad without a charger and then people try to charge it
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.720]  With a 5 watt charger. No, you're exactly right. They wouldn't be able to yeah. No, you're right
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.000]  They wouldn't it would be so slow. It might not even power on
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.500]  No, I think you're right. And that is the problem with the iPhone. I guess my argument is gonna be like at a certain point
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:59.840]  It's going to become more of a detriment. You're selling this premium product and Apple has changed the price. They have very firmly
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:07.480]  designated that the iPhone has a higher price point than it used to even and it is an expensive device and and part of that
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:12.880]  I think was predicated on the idea that Apple knows that people upgrade every three years rather than the previous
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.760]  Maybe two people keep their stuff longer. So I
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.580]  Get that but it's also like okay, but when you buy this new thing
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.400]  Don't you want to feel like you're getting some sort of upgrade? Yeah told and to your point
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.960]  you know paper formats, it's just
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.780]  All right, let me take a break here thank our next sponsors our good friends at Squarespace

[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.000]  Alright Christina, let's dig into the child safety stuff at Apple. I
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.040]  Put it off, but we got to get into it
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:46.320]  It's interesting it with the irregular nature of my podcast at this point at all
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.440]  It doesn't feel like old news, but it's not wet ink
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:57.800]  News, no, no, it was interesting because I think that a lot of and you've talked about it on dithering to I think at this
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800]  point it the a lot of the
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:06.320]  conversation of the debates about whether it's a good or a bad idea have kind of shifted to
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:13.120]  to now whether or not the algorithm is actually secure or safe or whether or not it can be reverse engineered and and and whether
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.640]  It should be used at least that's what it feels like to me
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.720]  Let's talk about the iMessage feature first
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:26.240]  So the iMessage feature and again even after all of the hey, I think people are conflating these two things
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.320]  Stuff people are still conflating. I see it every day. I still see articles where they conflate them
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.440]  The iMessage feature is only for children
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.520]  only
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.320]  if they're in an iCloud family and
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:47.360]  The only way anything ever leaves their device is if they're 12 or younger
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.360]  So if the if if you're a parent with a teenager
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.400]  You know 13 to 17 and they're in your iCloud family
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.400]  You still have to opt into this feature when it comes out which will be sometime later this year with iOS 15
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:04.160]  But for teenagers, it uses machine learning
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:11.440]  In iMessage only in iMessage not in mail not in their photo library not in
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.200]  Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger or any other thing just iMessage
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:26.080]  It will try to detect sexually explicit photos either incoming or outgoing and
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.600]  Give them a warning. Hey, are you sure you want to you know, look at this. Are you sure you want to send this?
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.520]  But nothing ever goes to the parent for a teenager and then if they're 12 or under it's the same machine learning
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.640]  that will try to identify these images that are sexually explicit and
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:52.800]  If parents still have to opt their kids in and if they do and the kid will get a warning and then they get like a
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:59.520]  Second warning and if they still go through then the parent gets a notification that says hey, you know the kid looked at
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  At this image or sent an image
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.920]  Different than the the CSAM detection which isn't about machine learning and trying to identify it
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.160]  Right that that that's a neural hash and comparing, you know, the bits and however many pieces they have right this is actually
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.480]  AI which is why they can apply it I think to the the messages after they've come in
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:24.960]  They're able to run their own neural nets against it and and figure out
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.720]  With probably a high degree of certainty because those are not difficult images to usually decipher to say
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.240]  This is you know a dong or this is breasts and and we're warning you
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:45.280]  There's so there's two angles of criticism for this particular feature and I had an interesting twitter thread with your co-host of
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.880]  Rockit, Brianna Wu. She was concerned about having grown up in a very conservative us south that
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840]  This could hurt
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.200]  Some kids who have
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:05.520]  It could be abusive parents could be parents with very restrictive views on oh, yeah
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.160]  LGBT
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:13.040]  Queer kids queer kids in in conservative households could definitely this would be the sort of thing where if if
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.320]  Your parents saw something that you were sharing or and maybe not even queer kids
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.320]  Maybe just kids who are in very conservative households who don't want you engaging in any sort of you know
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.640]  sexually charged or or even remotely adult content at all like
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.000]  this this could get kids who are in those those households, you know in in trouble and
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.440]  Potentially lead to you know, punishment abuse, whatever. Yeah
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.840]  What Brianna wrote opened my eyes to it and that the key insight
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.120]  Open my eyes to it and that the key insight that that she offered was
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.640]  Kids are one of the reasons we like we don't let kids vote, you know, because they're kids they make bad decisions, right?
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:57.760]  And so like the the logical angle is well wait all of the kids
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:05.520]  whether they're under 13 or teenagers they get like two levels of warnings to go through before it proceeds and
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.680]  You know if if like let's say a 12 year old right right on the cusp, you know
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.760]  Which yeah would be the most likely and they get two levels of warning
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:19.840]  So if they still go through with it, what what is the kid thinking? Well, guess what kids make bad decisions, right?
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:25.120]  Yes, they do and and and I would go even further. I I would say, you know kids make bad decisions, but also
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.800]  There's a bigger question, which is why why is it Apple's business?
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.000]  I I sort of see that and
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.160]  So of these two controversial features this iMessage one is is the one that um
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600]  That I feel more
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:49.680]  Hmm, I don't know and and I think what you just said is this Apple's business right and because if it is
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.480]  Why why iMessage only why not email why you know if they can use twitter dms
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.160]  They could use facebook messenger instagram, of course, you know is super popular, you know
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.680]  Yep
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.280]  Signal whatsapp telegram, um, there there are a million of them
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.160]  I think yik-yak apparently just came back. Although I don't think that that has i'm making fun of yik-yak
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:18.320]  But yeah, they're you know, snapchat tik tok like there are a lot of places where where kids can exchange messages
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.760]  and and apple's not going after them and
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:27.840]  Apple's not going after them and I I wonder it's like my big question when I heard about this and i'll be honest with you
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.200]  I actually
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.480]  Um, I have a lot of problems with with the CCM stuff and I have but a lot of those problems
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:41.440]  I think are kind of theoretical in in so far as I you know, we're we're making you know, I have questions about
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.400]  Um
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.800]  The onus of those databases and how those things are controlled and what powers apple, you know may have to
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.200]  Like agree with I also worry
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:25:00.000]  With some of the recent things about like having faith in how good this neural network and neural hashing stuff is
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.800]  I trust that apple has some of the best and brightest on it
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.040]  But also, you know people will find ways around this stuff and you look at false positives
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.840]  But those are more theoretical and and more like hypothetical in terms of like what could governments how could they abuse this?
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.720]  When I look at the iMessage stuff, I have a much more visceral
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.400]  This doesn't feel right. And and the question I personally keep having is
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.520]  Why is this an important business for apple to be in like why does apple have to have a part in this?
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.360]  Frankly nanny state kind of stuff like is it why why would this not be something that they could allow?
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.440]  A third party like disney who has circle and there are a number of other services
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:44.880]  That do various, you know monitoring and and more sophisticated ways than like the old net nanny stuff from a million years ago
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:53.040]  Like why can't they pass this off to third parties to manage whether it's through an mdm certificate that gets installed
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.760]  Which then could have the right to maybe you know filter messages the same way and also look at some other apps
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.880]  like why does apple have to do this is I guess a thing I I don't have a good answer to and I I
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.880]  It just it feels encroaching in a way that I don't like
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.520]  I
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  I agree with everything you just said theoreticals aside and we will get to them as we continue this segment of the show
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.200]  The theoretical problems with the c-sam detection
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.000]  With the eye that this is why I I feel more
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.000]  About this iMessage feature is
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:40.720]  Even if it works exactly as described and I have no reason to think it won't but even if that's it and it never gets expanded
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:47.280]  And there's never any situation where governments around the world put the squeeze on apple to say hey
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.960]  Can you use this thing that detects sexually explicit images in iMessage to also detect
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:01.200]  Blank, whatever blank is even if that never happens and this feature only works exactly as described
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.920]  Is it a good idea and I'm really struggling to figure out why anybody would think it's a good idea
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.160]  It's a good idea. What is it going to solve? I mean, maybe i'm wrong
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:17.760]  I mean, maybe there are I know the word that keeps getting talked about is grooming
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:26.080]  they know that kids get groomed by sexual predators and I I think it's sort of like the analogy of the
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.040]  Slowly boiling frog, you know that you you right you start by
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:37.840]  Text become desensitized to it. And yeah texting inappropriate words and inappropriate ideas
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.240]  And then it escalates to inappropriate photos and then further inappropriate, you know
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.120]  Even more inappropriate photos. I get it
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:54.480]  But is is having iMessage detect it through machine learning the way for parents
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.120]  To to deal with this I that doesn't seem right to me at all a regular
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:06.720]  Listen listeners of the show would agree. I I don't offer a lot of parenting advice and and I do think that it's
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.360]  It what is more personal than your family, you know? Yeah, you know and there are bad parents and that it's
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.560]  People who I think we can all you know, abusiveness we can all agree is is bad right and but there's you know
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.200]  There's a broad spectrum of parental philosophies that that one can
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.480]  That one can strongly disagree with but it's also not your business
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.960]  Right. I mean, I mean, I think that's ultimately the thing for me. There are bad parents
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.560]  There is way that harm could be done and and I try to think about like, okay
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.800]  Well, what's even in the best case scenario?
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.600]  Like okay, you are thinking that you're maybe stopping grooming and maybe you could stop some of it, right?
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.560]  I'm not trying to discount that although I would argue that by making this feature public the way that they are
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.960]  What you're really doing is just pushing those groomers to platforms like discord, which is what the kids are using
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.560]  anyway, or a signal or a telegram or whatever the case may be like they will just use
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.560]  Another app I message is really sticky and we all love it
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.560]  And it's the thing that I think is probably
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.800]  Like the strongest thing that Apple has in its arsenal in terms of keeping people locked into the ecosystem. It is it is great
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.880]  however
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.040]  if if Apple thinks that it is like a
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.360]  Like a guarantee that that's the that is the center of of how teens and and even like younger kids communicate. I
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:32.080]  I don't have a ton of experience with with the zoomers, but from what experience I do have that's not necessarily true
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.880]  Right, like a lot of them are all in on iMessage and I get that but a lot of them especially
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.680]  After having to spend the last year, you know remote like discord and other things are are common and if there are apps
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.680]  That you know and that your friends are being like this is the one that our parents can't monitor
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.160]  That's going to be the one you use right like I you know, I'm I'm old
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.920]  but I I when I was in middle school, we all had AOL instant messenger and we all had ICQ and
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.080]  if
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.800]  If there had been a way where I thought that my mom
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:10.020]  Could have been alerted of stuff that I sent in those messages, even if it was completely innocuous
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:17.120]  A that would really feel like a violation and gross and B my first instinct would be to be like, okay
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.120]  Well, let's find another app to use
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.720]  that my mom can't monitor I feel like that the idea that it's gonna stop that the grooming is is misguided and then to your
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.520]  Point yeah, we you know, I just I don't think it's Apple's business to make these decisions for parents
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.400]  I'll say this too. You know, I remember what it was like to be a kid and maybe I was a you know
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:42.240]  Kind of an asshole. I'm sure that I was but what I would do if I knew that this feature was a thing
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:48.080]  Okay, so it's not gonna work and it's not gonna knock on me if I'm 13, but if I'm 12, you know
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.400]  It's good. It's gonna knock on my my friends or whatever the day that I turn 13
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.880]  I'm sending my 12 year old friends
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.440]  Tons and tons of Shrek porn like that's what I'm doing because I want to get them in trouble, you know, right?
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.760]  and if it's like Shrek porn instead of like
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.280]  Worse it what's the worst?
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:14.880]  It what's the worst kid? Yeah, are their parents gonna call your parents and say Christina sent him and my mom would be like
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.000]  Christina, what are you doing? You know, she might yell at me
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.480]  She might be in TV restriction, but it's not me in the world
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.480]  But you know what? I wouldn't know and and then this is this is coming into hypotheticals
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.120]  But I think you know Brie brought this up and this is something important to know too
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:33.200]  Kids don't always know the situation their friends are in. Yes, and yeah and and this in the situation like
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:39.360]  I know that like no matter what I had sent her did unless it was something that was illegal, right or like violent or like
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360]  Just you know something that was just not okay
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.920]  My mom and even then my mom would support me
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.160]  She would like get me like the help that I would need it, right?
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.880]  I would never be a situation where my parents would like violently like do anything to me
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.920]  But I don't know that about all of my friends. I don't know how their parents react
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.640]  So if I send something I think it's funny and my my mom might have rolled her eyes
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:07.200]  My friend Nicky her conservative parents might see it and might have a completely different reaction
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.480]  and and Nicky's life at home might be very different or or
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.040]  You know
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.680]  Parental situations can be so complicated, right?
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:22.480]  You know, you can have divorced parents that with a serious philosophical divide on yes how to parent
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040]  preteens and teens and
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.320]  You as their friend might
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320]  Might
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.240]  Probably are
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240]  Largely unaware of it, right?
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.920]  And maybe they don't even you know
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.240]  Cuz maybe your friend doesn't share that with you because they're embarrassed by it, right?
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.280]  Right and because there are things like we don't really know ever, you know
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.480]  What sometimes we know what happens people some lives but a lot of times we don't
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:51.600]  And and so and I think it's easy for kids to assume. Well, my parents are like this. So everyone else's must be
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.520]  I was lucky
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:57.680]  In in some regards. I have a really great mom and my mom is um, uh,
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:03.760]  she's retired now, but she's a she's a child, um psychologist and she worked in the in the school system and
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.760]  My friends and it was frustrating to me at the time. I'm grateful for it now
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:13.040]  But I had friends who like would come over not to see me but to like talk to my mom
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.960]  And you know and and i'd be like can we hang out and they're you know in the kitchen, you know privately with my mom talking
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.120]  But I I was lucky I guess in the fact that when I was in middle school
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.360]  Which is the age I think that really this is what concerns me. It's it's not like the elementary age kids
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.640]  It's like the 12 year olds. It's the 11 12 year olds the kids who are in sixth and seventh grade
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.320]  and and I know that like, you know, a lot of those kids I I was able to learn at that age like
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.720]  Most people a lot of kids didn't not i'm not gonna say most but i'm gonna say a lot of kids
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:46.000]  Didn't have a mom like my mom and didn't feel like they had anybody they could open up to and talk to about difficult things
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.760]  and
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.760]  I'm glad my mom was there for them
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.760]  But I wouldn't have known that you know
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.480]  like I wouldn't have known that like the way that my parents act about stuff is different like
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.480]  Hey, you know
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.200]  My my best friend in high school
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.800]  Andrew is gay and his mom when she found out and I think she found out through some sort of email or something on the
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.360]  Computer, I don't know what it was, but she sent him to one of those conversion camps
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.160]  And it was it was terrible and it and and you know, he had a really hard time
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.640]  you know kind of dealing with that and struggling with his sexuality and acceptance and other stuff and
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.360]  You know
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:27.120]  I think that he probably would have been older than maybe this age of the iMessage stuff, you know
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.840]  His mom monitoring but maybe he would have been 12. I don't know
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.680]  I just I can't help but think about how bad it would be
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.360]  If stuff that he was, you know struggling with was outed to his mom
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.160]  By the person that makes his phone
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.880]  To me it's it's like are you is apple trying to draw a circle around?
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.640]  Stuff that's bad or drawing a circle around what's good
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.840]  And and with the iMessage feature in particular
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.920]  It's like they're trying to draw a circle around iMessage and say iMessage is good and safe
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.240]  Right and then it just leaves it. It's an infinite continuum of things
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.640]  that parents could object to that are going on and you you know it it I
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.440]  I do think I I know everybody likes to think that they live in the most interesting times
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:26.240]  But it is it's more tricky to be a parent in in today's world than it used to be
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:32.480]  It's it's because because of phones and right the internet it is definitely
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:40.560]  More complicated and and there are some bad things that technically seriously technically could not have happened
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.720]  You know you when I was a teenager when I was 12 years old. Nobody could send me a picture
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.800]  Digitally, you know, they I guess so you didn't have access, right?
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.520]  You didn't have access to this sort of stuff, but at the same time
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.000]  You know, I could talk on the phone and and somebody I could have an inappropriate conversation with somebody
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:03.040]  A peer somebody my age or an adult over the phone
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.760]  But that was understood and you know
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:12.560]  It's certainly a far narrower spectrum than all the things that are possible today and trying to draw a circle around
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.040]  iMessage and saying we're going to identify this just seems it I I just don't
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:19.920]  I I just don't see the point and and it
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:27.760]  It's yes in theory. Everything's trade-offs. It could help catch something right there. It's
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  But is it worth the
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.560]  The even even just the knock on apple's brand of being yeah
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:41.200]  Private, you know, everybody is mocking them for the what happens on your iPhone
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.480]  As they should frankly if you're going to make that marketing message
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.840]  if that is going to be the thing that you sell if you're going to make
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.480]  Money on that and you're going to hold that up as as if not only um, you know, this is our values, but we are better
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.000]  Because of this because that that was that's the implicit thing
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.680]  It's not just that this is our values, but we are better than facebook. We are better than google
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.800]  We are better than amazon
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.200]  We are better than whoever that is the message if you're going to make that statement and I think it's entirely fair to mock them
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.680]  when their other statements
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.800]  Run counter to that. So i'll i'll contrast that
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:24.880]  As we segue into the c sam detection where to me that's where apple is drawing a circle around something that they're saying is
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.920]  unambiguously bad which is collecting
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.120]  known
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.800]  child pornography and other abusive imagery and
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.200]  We collectively can say yes
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.440]  This is a rare point of almost universal
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.480]  Agree, yes, this is bad. We can all agree that this is bad
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.320]  We can all agree that this is material that does not need to exist. Yes, and so
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:56.240]  Like I said like that that contrast of let's just assume for this just for this segment of the conversation it works exactly as
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.360]  Described
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:04.480]  I think that this is a good thing and and it's a good idea and if it does work as described
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.120]  it'll only
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.240]  Make the world a better place now you can say well
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.840]  it won't make it a much better place because if it ships and and then all the people who
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.680]  collect child
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.520]  C sam material they're just not going to use iCloud photos
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.640]  They'll know, you know, what's the point if they know not to do it?
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:32.560]  It's based on the numbers being reported by like Facebook and Google from stuff online. No, a lot of these people
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:39.920]  They just know they don't care. They don't either don't care or they're they don't understand they don't know
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.640]  that they're you know, maybe yeah,
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.280]  Whatever the reason they are I I they are doing it. Yeah, I actually yeah, I agree with that. I actually think that that's a
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.280]  Not a spurious argument. I actually think that this is a good thing
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.440]  I actually think that this is something that if done correctly and everything works as it's supposed to
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.560]  Would cut down and um on or not maybe cut down but it would catch
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.720]  A lot of this behavior because most criminals are dumb. Yeah
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.880]  predators
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.760]  are usually not the most sophisticated and
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.880]  And maybe driven by impulses, right?
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.400]  I think some of it also comes down to people believing that they won't get caught
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:20.640]  Yeah, I do too that even if they know
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.720]  Even if they know that that apple can do this. Oh, i'm not gonna get caught. It's not a big deal, right? Not my
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.280]  Exactly. Mine is good. I got mine is good. I i'm so much better than everybody else, you know
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.360]  So I actually think that that that um, you know, people are gonna move to other things
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.440]  Look the big hoarders and the big people sure but but the
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.960]  The people who I think are like like the like the josh dugger type of people and that sort of thing
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.760]  Like these are not the smartest people out there and I do feel like this is the sort of thing that
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.800]  Would be able to trip them up, which I don't think is a bad thing
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.360]  If as you say we are making the assumption
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.600]  That everything is done exactly as it should be the point is not
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.600]  And apple would be the first people to make it clear that that's not even
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.360]  On their radar the point is not to keep every single
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.000]  iCloud user
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.200]  from ever
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.480]  Collecting c-sam in any way shape or form and and so if your argument is hey
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.440]  This isn't going this is so easily circumvented
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.280]  This isn't going to stop at all that the point isn't to stop at all
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.860]  The point is if you can anything you do catch that is actually legitimate
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:35.120]  This is accurately pegged. Yes, you've collected known c-sam. It is a good thing
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.820]  There's two angles on it. There's the initial knee-jerk
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:44.020]  Uh reaction which and literally this is the headline i'm not even putting words in the eff's mouth
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:49.540]  But they even said they used the field of dream slogan if you build it, they will come that if you build this system
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.500]  oppressive regimes
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:56.100]  Around the world are going to demand that apple
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.780]  Fingerprint other databases, right so that china could say make sure you know
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:05.460]  Here's a here's a thousand known photos of the dalai lama
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:11.140]  And we would like to know every single person who has one of these thousand photos in their iCloud library
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.300]  um
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.260]  I
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:20.020]  I disagree with that. I I don't think that that is going to happen
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:24.900]  I really don't I I would be willing to bet on it because if an oppressive regime
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:31.540]  Wanted to coerce apple or any other company that operates within their country
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:33.440]  into
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.820]  Prevailing on users for the benefit of the government
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:44.660]  The fingerprint hashing is not the way to do it that it's the it's the most convoluted and worst way to do it
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:48.420]  Right. It would be the machine learning which our phones already do
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.460]  Yeah, I was going to say I actually think that they could the iMessage would be an easier vector there
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:42:01.380]  And I will also point out that you know malware was already used by the chinese government against the ugars on iphones
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:08.660]  The the chinese government already installed malware to track the ugars and you know, yeah using like exploits, right?
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:13.060]  Yeah, yeah using exploits not through apple's help, but no not through apple's help
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:17.060]  So through other things which which I think is a good point not through apple's help. They were able to do this anyway
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.740]  So I think that but but I think that cuts both ways, right? I think on the one hand
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:26.660]  That shows without apple's help. They were still able to do this on the other hand
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.300]  I do think that shows like these are the things they're willing to do
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:34.900]  And so I think part of the effs argument which I don't disagree with is that if you are already making these provisions
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:41.940]  On your device and and within your your databases and within the way that your system is set up to do these sorts of checks
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:48.420]  That is opening up potentially another hole in another vector that could be abused not even through policy
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:54.020]  But through exploits and through other things and I don't think that that is false on its face
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:59.540]  I I think it's worth scrutiny and and I think that the fact that we collectively
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:06.740]  Including the eff and privacy advocates and encryption experts are scrutinizing. It is all a good thing
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:13.700]  I just don't think that it's it's likely to be abused in that way and and there's a feature
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:18.500]  So we're talking about this these two upcoming features one for iMessage one for
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:26.740]  Fingerprint detection of c-sam in in iCloud photos, but the the feature that to me if if this was going to be a problem
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:33.780]  Of coercing apple and others to do this is the machine learning that's already been in
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.380]  iCloud photos or not even iCloud just photos for years now like
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:45.300]  I wonder because it's one of those things where like first impressions matter and some people are like
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:50.340]  Much worse opinion of siri than the state of siri today series much better than a lot of things
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.140]  apple maps exactly
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:56.020]  the machine learning in
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:59.380]  Apple photos is really amazing
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:06.180]  Like I just typed the word dogs into search like it and I bet that there are a lot of people listening who are like really?
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:06.900]  You can just do that
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:12.020]  You can just type dogs into iCloud or into photos and it'll find a lot of people
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:17.620]  Type dogs into iCloud or into photos and it'll find pictures of dogs and it's like yeah or pizza
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:23.220]  It's like almost anything you can think of that is like an innocuous term. You can just type
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.140]  into
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:27.940]  Photos and it finds it that is so much
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:34.580]  Along these lines of hey, what if an oppressive government or or any government tried to coerce?
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.740]  apple into
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.860]  Doing their will in a privacy invasive way
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:46.580]  That feature already exists and is way more powerful if china wanted to coerce apple into finding
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.980]  Identifying chinese citizens who have pictures of Dalai Lama
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:58.580]  Yeah, they could already do that you're right it would be and it would be better for for them to use machine learning and
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:05.720]  They could find pictures of the Dalai Lama that chinese government doesn't even know existed as opposed to this fingerprint technology
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.200]  That only involves existing photos. So right
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:15.560]  I'm it's worth talking about and it is worth scrutinizing and it is good
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:20.920]  That because of the scrutiny apple has gone on the record and said no if we are asked to do this
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  We will tell any government anywhere in the world. We will we're not going to do that
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.520]  It's good that apple did that it is curious that apple didn't foresee that and have that
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:33.240]  in their day one messaging
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.160]  You know that the messaging was the messaging was such a cluster. Honestly, really?
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.000]  I mean part of it was probably because it feels like it was leaked early
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.440]  But regardless it never should have been a dual announcement. The messaging has just been off
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:51.560]  I do feel I do think that you make a compelling argument because I hadn't actually thought about that. I think you're right
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:56.680]  I I hadn't thought about that. I think that that's valid to say they could already do these things
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.160]  My only question my only pushback a little bit would be
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:08.680]  Now that apple has done this as part of a feature even if the ability to already existed does that now?
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.160]  Maybe encourage or put pressure or create an opportunity for these oppressive regimes
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:22.040]  India is one that I think of right because india has already made in my opinion completely ridiculous
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:29.160]  Assertions about stuff that twitter and other people can do and has been very very, you know, like fascist frankly
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.200]  with what content they deem appropriate and not like
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  And they have legal frameworks for this to say hey and whipping up a hysteria to get a significant
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.920]  If not a majority of the citizens behind it and to say yes, this is good. We should root this out
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:50.680]  We should do this. Yes. They are using the like the populism and whatnot to exactly to whip people up 100
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:57.160]  I do I am concerned like maybe and maybe we're wrong like it's one of those things where maybe they've
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.400]  They're way smarter than us and they've seen this ahead of this
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:05.400]  There's a part of me that is concerned that it's like hey now that they see what's possible even if as you point out
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.400]  It was already possible
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.840]  Does this now?
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:14.520]  Create an incentive for them to put these pressures on and to maybe try to implement their their own
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.400]  You know workarounds and say hey to legally operate here
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.280]  You have to do this even though they could have done it before
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:25.240]  Just puts the idea in there in the idea in their head and and that that's that's a concern
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:30.600]  Maybe that's unfounded. I don't know but I do think that that's a really good point that the technology already existed
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.560]  For some of the most egregious stuff. I also am glad that apple
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.840]  Very outwardly said we will not agree to do any of this. I think that's good like you
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.400]  I'm, not sure why that wasn't part of the messaging from the beginning
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:50.040]  one of the things I said right from the get-go and I feel more strongly about it now than day one is that it's a
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:56.360]  Disaster to announce these two features together because they're they're because they sound so similar it is you but it
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.040]  it's it's not coming from a position of ignorance or or
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:09.080]  obstinance to conflate the two it's very natural to conflate it's very natural to do it and and unfortunately because they're
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.120]  Look, they're both using neural networks. They're both using AI they're using it in different ways in one sense
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:18.680]  It is you know comparing to hashes in a database that they're they're they're using neural networks
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:26.040]  They're they're they're using like the algorithms that way in another it is straight up image recognition AI on like the sensor on the phone
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:32.200]  But if you don't have a deep understanding of those nuances, which most people don't and frankly people shouldn't have to
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.960]  You know the the that that's the job of the people who are putting the message out
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.680]  It's completely natural that it's completed and like you I see it all the time and I try to correct when I can
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:45.720]  On the other hand i'm going to be also completely candid. It is not my job. It is not your job
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.760]  It is not the press's job to like
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.760]  Apple's job for them which is to get out their press like we don't need to carry water for them if they couldn't get the
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.860]  Message out and if people are misunderstanding
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.800]  Frankly, it's on them a little bit to kind of clean it up
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:02.120]  Like we can obviously I think it's important for us to have
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:08.440]  The discussions on the distinctions because there are technical differences and policy differences, which are very different
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.020]  Right and and and I think that's a valid thing to have but it's not our responsibility
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:19.580]  To make sure that the general public understands the differences in these two features. That's on them for announcing them at the same time
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:25.420]  All right. Let me take one last break here and thank our fourth and final sponsor of the show a good friends at hover
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.280]  Hover is a jumping off point for a ton of entrepreneurs
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:34.540]  They want you to start your new business or your new project or your new personal
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:35.900]  personal
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:43.660]  website with a new domain name hover has over 300 domain name extensions to choose from that's
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:48.460]  Like back in the old days when it was like dot org dot net dot com
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:55.900]  They have 300 of those now and you can use any of them when you build your brand online. They have a great
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:03.260]  Great interface for finding a domain name that is available and with an extension
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.340]  That you like their support team
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:10.060]  Doesn't try to upsell you they only work hard to get you online
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:14.940]  They are confident that once you're using hover and you have your domain or domains
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:19.420]  If you have more than one at hover, you'll stay there because you like it and that's all they want
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:25.420]  But they'll also help you move your domains from wherever you have them registered now over to hover
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:28.540]  Where they have just it's just a great user experience
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:35.100]  It's truly one of these companies that their only goal is to have happy customers and they've been doing it for a long time
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:40.220]  It's just great. I've been a customer for a long time. They have best of class technical support
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:45.500]  They'll really help you with this and and you really don't want to mess up your domain name stuff if you're moving it somewhere else
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:52.380]  They'll make sure everything is right and it no interruption. Even they'll just help you do it the great extensions
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:55.900]  great search for finding a domain name that you want and
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:02.620]  It's really great. Where do you go to find out more go to hover HOV ER hover dot-com slash talk show and

[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.500]  slash
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:12.460]  talk show
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:17.420]  So the oppressive regime thing I I get it. I think it's overblown
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:23.420]  I think there's other features that would be way way riper for abuse. And again, it's worth thinking about that
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:29.020]  I actually think it's more we should be thinking more about the ways other features could be abused
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:33.020]  As we put more and more of our lines and our communication on these devices
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:39.660]  The thing that's interesting to me over the last couple days though is this idea of hash collisions some open-source
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.420]  researcher thinks that maybe that they
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:49.580]  Had the algorithm and Apple says no that's actually you know, there's something in iOS version
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.580]  There's something in iOS version. Yeah, but it whether
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:56.300]  That hash collision was found or not
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:00.380]  It doesn't even matter. It's could it happen again in the future and
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:07.580]  My understanding is that and and the one proposed, you know, somebody on reddit was like, hey
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:12.780]  I think I found a collision and it was like a picture of a dog and then the the picture that
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:18.220]  generated the same hash which is just like a 30 character string just like
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.340]  it
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.500]  alpha a to z one one to zero
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.700]  Characters
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:29.980]  30 characters very very small compared to an image, but the one that matched was like a gray blob
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:36.700]  It's just it just looks like a if you wanted to say it was a photo. It'd be like a photo of gray putty, you know
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:41.900]  It it wasn't like a picture of a similar dog or another dog
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:47.580]  And I think my understanding of the cryptography. I feel pretty safe to say that if
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.700]  Apple ships this as they state and
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:56.460]  Hash collisions are found in the shipping version. It is
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:00.220]  almost certain like seriously like
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:02.860]  You know heat death of the universe
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:10.380]  Mathematics that the the images that would be generated to match it aren't going to be
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:16.700]  The child sexual abuse material, right the fake race, right? They're just going to be they're not even going to look like anything
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:21.980]  They're they're they're just you know, random pixels almost but that they happen to
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:26.860]  Put through the same algorithm come out with the same score. It's almost
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:34.380]  It's not the best analogy, but it's sort of like having two photos that that are the exact same size in bytes
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:37.420]  Except even way more unlikely, right?
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:43.020]  But the idea would be that it's an interesting idea that could it be abused this way that if you could
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:49.980]  Generate these and you know that you have you have a collection of a hundred images that hash
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:55.420]  To the values of things in this database. They look like
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:01.740]  Visual gibberish, but if I can insert them into your iCloud photo library
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:07.260]  And you don't notice or you think I don't know what that is, but you let it go. It's sort of like swatting
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:11.500]  Right, like you're not going to go to jail if I did this to you, Christina
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.620]  You're not going to go to jail
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:21.980]  Because you don't actually have CSAM almost it may but you know, but what if the police come to your door?
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.220]  and that's the thing that scares me is that it's like
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:29.180]  Okay, it is kind of like swatting because it's like okay. You are probably not going to go to jail because you're not going to go to jail
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.140]  But it could give prosecutors who already at least in the United States have
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:41.260]  Extreme overreach and I think are given far too much power to grab people's devices and get orders and an apple who does
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:46.540]  Turn a lot of information that they have over to law enforcement officers when asked to request, you know
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:52.940]  In some cases they decline but in many cases they agree to say okay. Well now we have
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:55:00.300]  probable cause to grab your phone and to get a backup of all your data and now we can search this and for the moment stuff is
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:03.100]  Tricky, especially with digital and I'm not a lawyer disclaimer there
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:07.740]  But let's say they were kind of when looking through to try to find these photos that don't exist
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.780]  They find something else right right, right, you know that that that's a concern. Um,
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.300]  I also again this becomes completely paranoid and I'm not saying that this is even likely but also
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:23.340]  There are cases where I don't think that this and I'm not talking about local law enforcement here
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:25.580]  I'm talking about like agencies and groups that
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:29.980]  To be honest probably have better ways of entrapping people but you know
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.180]  When we talk about oppressive regimes or even other things if you're saying okay
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:38.780]  Well, we have a payload at this point where we're putting this stuff on your device and we're going to use that
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.940]  as a way to
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.980]  Then be able to um, try to you know
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:49.340]  Catch you up on something else, you know, like like this is the way that we are going to purposely
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:57.020]  Say that hey we found this so that we can now search all of your stuff right and and to be clear
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:05.020]  Swatting is a real problem. And if if if in the best case scenario where it's just some teenage
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.260]  Idiot, who's doing it for the lulls and
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:16.220]  It the police come to the victim's house and they're armed and they knock and oh they figure out nothing happened
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:22.780]  It's just a huge annoyance to the victim, but i'm not downplaying the fact that there have been people who've been shot died
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:28.060]  Yeah, people have died right? I've got heart attacks people been shot like people. Yeah, it is it is it is
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:33.180]  Not yeah, it's it's a problem and I mean that in the same way with this where if if
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.220]  It's a problem
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:40.300]  It's a problem and I mean that in the same way with this where if if if there are
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.980]  Weaknesses in the hashing algorithm that make it too easy
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:48.300]  to generate
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:50.060]  false matches
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.060]  And this becomes rampant
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:59.580]  A I guess if it became rampant enough apple would have to either completely rejigger the system or pull it right if if they got
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.420]  overwhelmed
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.980]  By this but but my concern
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:07.260]  With the idea of somebody being
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:17.100]  Victimized by having the stuff planted in their iCloud photo library is
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:25.500]  It seems unlikely because it also seems just as unlikely that somebody could just plant real
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:31.020]  See sam images and again that could be that that might even be the bigger weakness, right?
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:37.340]  Is there a way you know that if you get access to somebody's phone or their mac, which might be more likely
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:45.660]  Okay, or I mean like let's just say because this happens sometimes, you know, you have airdrop on like i'm i'm being completely like crazy here
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:50.140]  But you know, like if someone sends you a bunch of messages, you know an airdrop and you see one
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.460]  But it's not like you see all of them and they all come in at one time
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:58.380]  Like maybe if somebody hides it in there and and just you know, or somebody's not thinking and they just hit accept
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:04.940]  I don't know. I mean that again i'm i'm reaching but you know, i'm reaching i'm just saying what about the abusive x
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:09.340]  Who has your password and you don't even know they have your ikon password, right?
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.060]  I think that there are plenty of abusive x's and plenty of
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:17.340]  Terrible individuals who would weaponize if they thought that they could who would weaponize this sort of thing for sure
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:22.540]  And if they put it in and it has an old date so it doesn't you know
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.540]  Like when you go looking for your recent photos, it doesn't and you're like, yeah
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:31.980]  You're like I have three hundred thousand photos. Yeah, and why am I looking at this thing from 2012, right? This old image
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:37.660]  37 images from 2012 that are randomly strewn about 2012 2013
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:43.580]  I I do think apple has put a lot of thought into this. I don't think that they've undertaken this lightly at all
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:48.060]  I think they're very serious. But and again, i'm not it's a hypothetical
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:50.860]  but uh
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:56.880]  My concern would be with the human review that apple is saying that they're going to undertake
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:05.260]  It's more likely that that an innocent person is going to get into trouble over this the more accurate their system is
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:07.820]  Right, like if it really is true
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:14.140]  That there's a one in a trillion chance of any individual's iCloud account being innocent
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.660]  innocent account being flagged incorrectly by the system
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:25.420]  That means that the people who are reviewing it which and and they might be reviewing a lot right like facebook reported 20 million
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:29.340]  Instances of see sam being shared google
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:32.860]  I guess through like google photos google drive
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:39.500]  Reported half a million last year, you know, that's a lot even if facebook's is off the chart
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:42.380]  Even if if facebook isn't the ballpark
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:46.940]  iCloud photos is going to be in when this system goes live, you know
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:50.700]  googles might be though half a million and if your team goes through
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:54.940]  four hundred ninety nine thousand and they're all
[01:59:55.820 --> 02:00:01.420]  Guilty of it. It's legit. Yep that we should report this to nick mack this this looks you know
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:07.980]  Like this person is has has known see sam. We're going to you know report this as as they should
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.740]  Yeah
[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:15.580]  What are the odds that they're going to be paying attention to the four hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety first?
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:20.300]  991st instance where maybe it is somebody who who had these gray blobs?
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:22.780]  in there
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:23.740]  Yeah
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:23.980]  No
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:29.500]  I thought that was a good point you made a couple weeks ago on your blog about how one of the questions about this
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:32.620]  Is like how many people do they have who are dedicated to this review process, right?
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:39.020]  Because this is new for apple. This is not something they've had to do before they have app review, but that's different like this has
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:44.620]  Consequences and facebook the working conditions for their moderators has been deplorable
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:50.140]  But facebook and google with youtube and other places have had people who that is their job
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:55.920]  And and I I think the the question is if especially since we rolled it to so many people like do they have the infrastructure?
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:00.140]  And the training for people to be able to review
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:04.540]  Whatever they need to review that matches the right way
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:09.660]  I know that they're not seeing the images but even to review like the hatches like do they have that right training and well
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:15.980]  But they do see they do see the visual derivative, which is a fancy way of saying a low resolution version of it
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.700]  You know that there is something to look at and and if it truly it's just like a gray blob
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:24.860]  You you you might be like, oh this this doesn't seem like c sam at all
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:32.300]  But day in day out eight hours a day and every single, you know with one in a trillion chances you you you know
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.980]  That's all you're looking at are these visual derivatives of this horrific stuff
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:43.260]  And again, I don't there's no good answer to this, right? No, there's not. I mean, this is the challenge that all of them face
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:48.380]  It's like how do we deal with this sort of content because there's a human cost not just in in in error
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:51.020]  But there's also like the human cost of people who have to do this
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:57.740]  It's bad if they don't look for it and it's monstrous if they do right it it's a monstrous job
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:02.860]  Yeah, no, I mean so when I was god I was 17 or 18, um, I was in high school
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:06.140]  I was working at best buy and I was a computer tech
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.020]  I also worked in sales, but I um was good
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:14.860]  And so they would pay me more money to also fix the computers this is before they had geek squad and and some woman brought in
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.420]  Her son's computer and wanted some sort of backup and some sort of other thing done
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:23.180]  And while i'm doing the backup and i'm doing the stuff I find
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.100]  See sam
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:30.220]  And i'm young i've never seen or wanted to see anything like that. It was a horrible experience
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:33.180]  I had to contact the georgia bureau of investigation
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:38.700]  and report it and then send the computer off to them and then had to deal with
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:43.020]  The mother coming to know why she's not getting the computer back
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:49.660]  I wasn't trained on how to have that conversation and she's screaming at me. She's yelling all kinds of things
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:52.700]  I mean it was a it was not a great experience at all
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:58.140]  And it's one of those things that stuck with me a that the stuff that was there was horrific and the whole thing and I wouldn't
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:02:59.660]  wish
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:05.900]  Having to spend a lot of time with that on anybody even if they're trained for it, even if they're they're paid for it
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:11.660]  I don't know what the solutions are. Yeah, I don't know either I I do I so i'm not saying that this feature is a mistake
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.100]  In the way that I think I am with the iMessage one
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:19.420]  I this might be the best course going forward, you know, it might be
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:25.420]  I just but but they better be I really really hope that apple is institutionally prepared
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:29.660]  Institutionally prepared for it and I like I wrote, you know
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:35.900]  I honestly think that they genuinely don't and couldn't know before they turn this feature on
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:38.540]  How big of a problem they're going to uncover?
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:40.060]  Yeah
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:46.060]  I think that's true. Uh, and I think that would be that's that's maybe my overarching concern when I read that you wrote that
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:50.700]  I was like, yeah, I think this is right. I think everything else we can have is is hypotheticals and even this like
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:52.060]  We don't know how big it is
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.220]  but I think that like my overarching hope is that they have
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:01.660]  the infrastructure and the people in place to be able to do this and do it the right way because
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:05.500]  This is one of those reputation making or breaking things
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:05.900]  Yeah
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:13.740]  Especially early on if there are even alleged like high profile cases of false claims or of other stuff
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:16.540]  That is damaging. Um
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:21.340]  Uh, it I I just and maybe maybe this is something they have to do maybe you know
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:26.060]  There's been a lot of you know discussion that this was something they were very much influenced by you know
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.380]  government by the government to implement
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:31.580]  I have to be honest though that does also make me
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:38.380]  Worry because if if they were willing to implement this because of pressures over whether it was antitrust or this or that
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.860]  That does sort of weaken the argument
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.980]  That if faced with other pressures
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:48.460]  Apple would say no, I do think there's a good chance that the upside
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:53.740]  Is that it's an overall win for privacy on the grounds that?
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:58.620]  This is what apple sees as a necessary step before
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:03.260]  enabling true end-to-end encryption for iCard photos and backups
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:06.380]  If that is what we actually get from this
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.020]  I would I would agree with that. So
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:15.420]  Let's give them a couple years because you know, that's a serious it's a big thing. And and I know I know that the
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:23.740]  The biggest reason that they don't have end-to-end encryption yet isn't law enforcement pressure from the FBI or anywhere else
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:31.420]  It's customer service that it is a daily occurrence that people come in and say I don't have access to any of my apple devices
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.740]  Or maybe they only had one apple device, you know, they only had one or or someone died, you know
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:43.100]  There's all kinds my mom died my mom died and I I she has so many photos, you know, I I can I get them
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:47.260]  It's a it's a day in day out heartbreaking problem
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:53.420]  But that apple can solve now because apple can unlock this and there's a procedure to vet that the person saying hey
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:55.980]  This is my account they they do it if
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:03.260]  Let's say three years from now there is end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups and photos
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:05.820]  for iCloud backups and photos and
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:11.760]  This was the first step so that they could say yet. We're doing it in a way that identifies
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:14.140]  csam
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:18.220]  And you know that that feature from WWDC just two months ago
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:24.860]  Where now you can name like a family member or a friend as a trusted person to recover your iCloud account
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:29.820]  Smells to me like they're moving in that slowly moving in that direction, right?
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.620]  That that this is another way that I could lose access to my devices
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:40.220]  But if I've named you as somebody who's trusted then you can help me get back into iCloud
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.980]  Even if it's end-to-end encrypted, it's just adding you
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.340]  Christina as one of the ends that's who's not apple, you know, right?
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:54.860]  But if not, if three four years from now, we still don't have end-to-end encryption on backups
[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:57.020]  It does make me question why apple is doing this
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:58.620]  Yes
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:01.500]  Yeah, my hope would be that this is our level to get there
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:07.660]  I still think that there is a valid discussion and and a debate to have about whether the trade-off is worth it or not
[02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:13.820]  I would probably err on saying yeah, I would think that it would be I think that that having encrypted backups is important
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:19.500]  Not maybe even as default because of the customer service issue as you say but as an option
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:23.820]  That I guess remains to be seen and that certainly I think would have made sense
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:28.300]  if that's what this is leading up to but like you said we're just gonna have to wait give them a couple of years but if
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.300]  It's if we're talking in five years
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:35.900]  Apple being apple. They're not telling us in advance. No, they're not telling us anything and and people reach out
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:38.060]  I mean i've even reached out not that they like respond to me anymore
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:42.380]  But like I still like do my due diligence when I like I hear things like i'm not gonna go on
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.300]  Podcaster or twitter or whatnot about trying to get you know confirmation one way or another
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.820]  If I can't get something confirmed i'm not gonna say it, but we haven't heard
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:54.540]  Oh, they're not telling us but I will say this if in five years if you and I are on a podcast together
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:00.060]  And we're still like well, maybe next year. We'll have end-in encryption. I'm i'm gonna be like, yeah, I
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:06.620]  I'm calling bs. It's starting to feel overdue at this point. So let's let's hope so christina. Thank you
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:09.020]  So much for your time. This was uh
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:14.540]  Covered everything I really wanted to cover and it's some of it unpleasant but uh
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:18.220]  Boy, I really enjoyed this conversation. So thank you so much for your time
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:23.180]  Maybe six months from now you'll be back on and we'll have news on the end-to-end encryption front. Who knows?
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:25.740]  That'd be great or we'll have like more fun stuff to talk about
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:28.860]  No, but this is this is great. Thank you so much for having me
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:48.460]  Outstanding. Thank you, christine
