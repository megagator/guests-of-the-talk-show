[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Hello from beautiful Southern California.
[00:04.960 --> 00:08.320]  Hello from very cold dark Philadelphia.
[00:08.320 --> 00:11.120]  Oh, I expect nothing less from Philly.
[00:11.120 --> 00:12.240]  No, you're still in Southern Cal?
[00:12.880 --> 00:15.440]  Yeah, well, so I was in Arizona.
[00:15.440 --> 00:18.320]  So we came through LA, we go out to my mom's place in Arizona,
[00:18.320 --> 00:20.160]  and then we come back through, because it's such a long drive.
[00:20.160 --> 00:22.640]  You can't really drive direct from San Francisco to Phoenix,
[00:22.640 --> 00:23.840]  because the mountains are in the way.
[00:23.840 --> 00:26.000]  So it's about halfway to my in-laws.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.840]  So we spent a day here coming down, and a couple days going back.
[00:29.840 --> 00:32.880]  So it's a two for all the grandparents are visible,
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.720]  and that's a pretty good trip.
[00:34.720 --> 00:35.920]  I'll drive him, though.
[00:35.920 --> 00:37.360]  I'll come back to that, because there's something
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.240]  you wrote about recently.
[00:38.240 --> 00:40.800]  I want to touch on with the road trip.
[00:40.800 --> 00:42.800]  But big picture.
[00:42.800 --> 00:44.560]  Last time you were on this show.
[00:45.280 --> 00:46.240]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46.240 --> 00:49.840]  You were still the editorial director for Macworld.
[00:49.840 --> 00:51.200]  For like 48 hours, yeah.
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.880]  Yeah, it was the night before the Apple event.
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.640]  It was like September 8th, I think.
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.080]  Was that it?
[00:58.080 --> 00:59.680]  Or was it the 7th?
[00:59.680 --> 01:02.080]  We might have recorded the 7th and published the 8th.
[01:02.080 --> 01:03.280]  Yeah, I think that's, I think that's right.
[01:03.280 --> 01:05.120]  I think I remember sending a note to Dave Wiscus in.
[01:05.120 --> 01:08.080]  Like, is that going to go up before the Apple event?
[01:08.080 --> 01:10.160]  Because nobody's going to want to listen to it afterward.
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.680]  But yeah, we were right on the cusp of the Apple event,
[01:13.680 --> 01:15.600]  and then the Macworld layoffs and everything
[01:15.600 --> 01:16.400]  happened the next day.
[01:18.720 --> 01:21.120]  Yeah, that was pretty funny.
[01:21.120 --> 01:24.000]  Because I was like, oh, I could talk to John about it.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.680]  And I was like, no, I can't talk to John about it.
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.520]  Because it's so, so what big new things are going to have
[01:29.520 --> 01:30.000]  in this week?
[01:31.760 --> 01:32.720]  I'm frightened.
[01:32.720 --> 01:34.560]  Well, there's going to be a new year
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.080]  because the earth goes around the sun,
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.760]  and nothing we can do can stop that.
[01:38.320 --> 01:40.640]  So it's going to be 2015.
[01:40.640 --> 01:41.440]  So there's something.
[01:42.480 --> 01:44.400]  And beyond that, let's hope nothing.
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.400]  I could use a little less fewer interesting events post-talk show.
[01:50.400 --> 01:53.360]  So it fascinates me, though.
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.200]  It really does because, you know, in the grand scheme of things
[01:57.200 --> 01:58.880]  September is not that long ago.
[01:58.880 --> 02:00.880]  It's, you know, three months.
[02:00.880 --> 02:01.360]  Yeah.
[02:04.160 --> 02:10.880]  Yet somehow your new role doing your thing at six colors,
[02:10.880 --> 02:14.880]  and, you know, it all seems settled already.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.800]  That, you know, settled is not quite right.
[02:16.800 --> 02:20.080]  But it feels normal to me now that you're writing at six colors,
[02:20.080 --> 02:23.520]  and, you know, Macworld as we knew it doesn't exist anymore.
[02:24.240 --> 02:25.280]  I appreciate that.
[02:25.280 --> 02:28.720]  It's, um, I mean, one of the big things,
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.160]  and I've said this on other podcasts, too.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.320]  I, it's not like I wasn't planning on leaving.
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.840]  I wasn't entirely sure.
[02:33.840 --> 02:36.240]  I mean, and I've said on other podcasts, too,
[02:36.240 --> 02:37.120]  and I'll say it to you directly.
[02:37.120 --> 02:39.120]  I mean, you were obviously a huge inspiration
[02:39.120 --> 02:41.360]  and Jim Delrimple and Federico Vitecci,
[02:41.360 --> 02:44.240]  and other people I know who have gone out on their own John Moltz
[02:44.240 --> 02:46.160]  and done their own websites and, you know,
[02:46.160 --> 02:48.400]  and some podcasts and some freelance and all of that.
[02:48.400 --> 02:50.400]  And I had been thinking about that for a while.
[02:50.400 --> 02:53.040]  Um, and in fact, a year ago,
[02:53.040 --> 02:56.720]  I started basically putting together a home office in my garage
[02:56.720 --> 02:59.520]  because we had no workspace in the house.
[02:59.520 --> 03:00.880]  It's a, it's a pretty small house.
[03:01.840 --> 03:04.240]  And, uh, and the garage was, uh,
[03:04.240 --> 03:05.680]  we bought a mini van a few years ago,
[03:05.680 --> 03:07.440]  and you couldn't can't park them any van in the garage.
[03:07.440 --> 03:08.240]  It's too big.
[03:08.240 --> 03:10.080]  And so the garage became, when we were,
[03:10.080 --> 03:10.880]  we were doing our kitchen,
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.480]  it was a place where all the junk in the house went
[03:12.480 --> 03:13.440]  while we were redoing it,
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.120]  and then that all came back in and sort of like,
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.080]  what are we doing in the garage?
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.400]  And I was increasingly unhappy with my job,
[03:18.400 --> 03:19.600]  and I kept thinking, you know,
[03:19.600 --> 03:21.200]  the garage needs to be a home office,
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.240]  and I started building it,
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.720]  and the entire intent was not to have really nice work
[03:24.720 --> 03:25.600]  at home days.
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.760]  The intent was that that would be my office eventually,
[03:27.760 --> 03:28.800]  because I would leave Macworld,
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.080]  and I would want to at least try to do my own thing,
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.240]  rather than go, you know,
[03:34.240 --> 03:35.760]  we'd always joked, um,
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.440]  one of the past presidents of Macworld,
[03:37.440 --> 03:38.480]  and I had joked that like,
[03:38.480 --> 03:39.520]  oh, Jason will be the last one
[03:39.520 --> 03:40.800]  to turn the lights off at Macworld.
[03:40.800 --> 03:42.560]  At the end, Macworld will be just Jason
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.800]  in his garage, um,
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.720]  doing Macworld, and I had that moment,
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.640]  when I was watching you and Federico and Jim,
[03:48.640 --> 03:49.760]  and people like that,
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.360]  that, um, I thought to myself,
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.360]  well, one, if people can do that on their own,
[03:55.360 --> 03:56.720]  I don't need to do that here,
[03:56.720 --> 03:57.840]  and if I'm going to do that,
[03:57.840 --> 03:58.480]  I want to own it.
[03:58.480 --> 04:01.040]  I want to be that the person who does that,
[04:01.040 --> 04:03.360]  not, uh, just kind of, uh,
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.200]  doing all my work toward the, you know,
[04:05.200 --> 04:07.280]  mysterious overlords who own a company
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.400]  who owns a company that owns a company that owns Macworld.
[04:10.400 --> 04:11.680]  And so I was, I was planning it,
[04:11.680 --> 04:12.480]  so in a way,
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.800]  I've been thinking about it for a long time,
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.240]  for more than a year,
[04:16.240 --> 04:18.240]  and then there was the,
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.960]  so we, we saw each other at, uh,
[04:20.960 --> 04:22.560]  XOXO right afterward too,
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.640]  so I, I got to see you a couple of times
[04:24.640 --> 04:26.320]  right around that crazy time,
[04:26.320 --> 04:27.360]  and I saw you at the Apple event,
[04:27.360 --> 04:28.160]  so I saw you three times,
[04:28.160 --> 04:30.560]  and like a week, um,
[04:30.560 --> 04:33.840]  and, uh, what was really funny about that time
[04:33.840 --> 04:35.040]  is that because of the timing,
[04:35.040 --> 04:37.680]  because we got the iPhone review units,
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.200]  and the iPhone reviews were all going to drop
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.320]  the following week,
[04:40.320 --> 04:43.600]  and I had this moment where a normal person would have said,
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.920]  I just left my job of 17 years,
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.320]  I'm going to take a few weeks to recalibrate
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.600]  and decide what I'm going to do next,
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.640]  and for me, it was one,
[04:50.640 --> 04:53.360]  I'd already been thinking about what I wanted to do next,
[04:53.360 --> 04:55.200]  and two, I had that iPhone,
[04:55.200 --> 04:55.760]  and I was like,
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.560]  well, everybody,
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.160]  everybody knows the biggest time of the year
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.120]  for writing about Apple stuff
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.160]  is when the new iPhones and iOS and macOS come out,
[05:02.160 --> 05:03.600]  and that's now,
[05:03.600 --> 05:05.120]  so I thought, you know what?
[05:05.120 --> 05:06.480]  I don't launch the site,
[05:06.480 --> 05:07.280]  like next week,
[05:07.280 --> 05:09.040]  and so like literally less than a week
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.760]  after I left Macworld, six colors launched,
[05:11.760 --> 05:13.920]  not because I make total crazy person,
[05:13.920 --> 05:17.280]  but because I felt like I couldn't not be out there
[05:17.280 --> 05:18.160]  at that moment.
[05:19.280 --> 05:20.800]  So I think it's those two things,
[05:20.800 --> 05:22.320]  it's that I managed to hit that site
[05:22.320 --> 05:24.720]  when we were at the high season for Apple stuff,
[05:24.720 --> 05:27.120]  and because I didn't think about it for so long,
[05:27.120 --> 05:29.040]  that I was ready to make it happen,
[05:30.080 --> 05:30.880]  and, you know,
[05:30.880 --> 05:32.320]  and it does feel,
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.200]  and it feels great too,
[05:33.200 --> 05:34.960]  so it feels right to be doing it,
[05:34.960 --> 05:36.320]  so I think all of those things
[05:36.320 --> 05:39.280]  may be feed into why it feels like a natural thing,
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.360]  and not some like crazy thing that just happened
[05:41.360 --> 05:42.160]  a couple months ago,
[05:42.160 --> 05:43.680]  even though that's sort of what happened.
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.000]  How long were you at IDG?
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.960]  Well, I was in Macworld,
[05:48.960 --> 05:50.720]  in Macworld 17 years,
[05:50.720 --> 05:54.240]  I've been doing this a little more than 20,
[05:54.240 --> 05:58.000]  coming up 21 years of sort of full-time Apple stuff.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.280]  But that counts as part of it.
[05:59.280 --> 06:00.480]  How's the day, user?
[06:00.480 --> 06:02.320]  So I was at Macuser until 97,
[06:02.320 --> 06:03.280]  94 to 97,
[06:03.280 --> 06:04.720]  and then what happened is that,
[06:04.720 --> 06:08.880]  which is just a hilarious moment in Apple history, right?
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.280]  97, jobs is coming back,
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.440]  but Apple is dying,
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.240]  and everybody's thinking,
[06:14.240 --> 06:16.160]  oh, Apple's gonna go out at Macworld Expo.
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.920]  They actually have the cash infusion
[06:17.920 --> 06:20.480]  from Microsoft to keep the lights on,
[06:20.480 --> 06:22.800]  and meanwhile, they're working on the iMac.
[06:22.800 --> 06:24.680]  And at that moment, that summer,
[06:24.680 --> 06:26.120]  right before the Bill Gates thing
[06:26.120 --> 06:27.840]  at Macworld Expo in Boston,
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.280]  the executives at IDG,
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.240]  and as Avdavis said,
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.480]  we need to cut our losses,
[06:31.480 --> 06:32.800]  because Apple is gonna die,
[06:32.800 --> 06:34.440]  and we've got these two magazines,
[06:34.440 --> 06:35.520]  and these two big staff.
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.680]  So why don't we just share the risk,
[06:38.640 --> 06:41.440]  put the two organizations together,
[06:41.440 --> 06:43.000]  lay off half of each staff,
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.400]  and just sort of stick them all together,
[06:44.400 --> 06:45.760]  and make one magazine,
[06:45.760 --> 06:46.760]  and we'll do that,
[06:46.760 --> 06:47.960]  because Apple's a loser.
[06:47.960 --> 06:49.640]  We need to get out of this business.
[06:49.640 --> 06:51.740]  It was the single worst time,
[06:53.040 --> 06:54.200]  just terrible timing,
[06:54.200 --> 06:56.080]  because a couple months later even,
[06:56.080 --> 06:58.720]  it was clear that Apple was gonna be probably okay,
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.080]  and then very rapidly after that,
[07:00.080 --> 07:02.480]  and much better than okay.
[07:02.480 --> 07:03.320]  And so as a result,
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.160]  over to Macworld,
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.280]  and it was this weird 50-50 joint venture,
[07:06.280 --> 07:10.680]  where these two arch enemy companies co-owned our company,
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.040]  and we're at each other's throats,
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.560]  except for us,
[07:13.560 --> 07:15.400]  and that was really bizarre.
[07:15.400 --> 07:17.000]  And then after a couple of years,
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.320]  as Avdavis was going through,
[07:18.320 --> 07:19.800]  they were getting bought and rebought,
[07:19.800 --> 07:21.280]  and different investors,
[07:21.280 --> 07:23.640]  and had all sorts of financial problems,
[07:23.640 --> 07:25.360]  because the guy who started that company,
[07:25.360 --> 07:28.000]  retired, his sons didn't wanna take over the family business,
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.400]  so they sold it off.
[07:29.400 --> 07:31.640]  They were, you know, it was a financial mess.
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.520]  And that's it for it was that Davis.
[07:33.520 --> 07:34.880]  It was Bill Ziff,
[07:34.880 --> 07:36.920]  and the Ziff brothers, his kids,
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.280]  were like, screw this media crap.
[07:40.280 --> 07:42.840]  We're gonna be venture capitalists,
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.640]  and so they just sold the business,
[07:44.640 --> 07:45.840]  and they sold it to,
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.120]  I mean, it's kind of inside baseball,
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.480]  but they sold it to,
[07:49.520 --> 07:50.760]  I think Teddy Forstman,
[07:50.760 --> 07:51.960]  who was like, at one point,
[07:51.960 --> 07:53.960]  had been romantically linked to Princess Diana,
[07:53.960 --> 07:54.880]  I mean, like crazy stuff,
[07:54.880 --> 07:56.920]  and then he sold it like a year later
[07:56.920 --> 08:00.080]  to Masayoshi Son of Softbank in Japan,
[08:00.080 --> 08:01.680]  who was, who bought it,
[08:01.680 --> 08:03.920]  I think Teddy Forstman picked up a billion dollars
[08:03.920 --> 08:05.240]  by holding it for a year.
[08:05.240 --> 08:06.080]  Pretty good deal.
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.760]  Wow, good job, Teddy.
[08:07.760 --> 08:09.480]  And then Softbank.
[08:09.480 --> 08:10.680]  Talk about ancient history though,
[08:10.680 --> 08:12.200]  just think about the basic story
[08:12.200 --> 08:13.800]  of picking up a billion dollars
[08:13.800 --> 08:16.480]  by holding a mostly print focus.
[08:16.480 --> 08:17.920]  But yeah, magazine publisher.
[08:17.920 --> 08:19.640]  Oh yeah, free.
[08:19.640 --> 08:22.240]  Well, I mean, it was not worth what Masayoshi Son paid for it,
[08:22.240 --> 08:23.200]  and I think I was a visionary,
[08:23.200 --> 08:24.360]  but he was also kind of crazy,
[08:24.360 --> 08:26.280]  and the money he was spending was kind of crazy.
[08:26.280 --> 08:27.800]  He's still around doing other stuff,
[08:27.800 --> 08:30.080]  but anyway, so that was all so messed up
[08:30.080 --> 08:33.120]  that Zedavis was like, we want money.
[08:33.120 --> 08:35.760]  And IDG was very much like, oh, well,
[08:35.760 --> 08:36.880]  we messed this up,
[08:36.880 --> 08:38.280]  and we wanna be in the Apple business,
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.360]  Macworld was the first Apple,
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.600]  Mac publication, we wanna keep that going,
[08:42.600 --> 08:43.840]  and so they bought them out.
[08:43.840 --> 08:45.200]  So the answer to the question is,
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.760]  I was probably at IDG,
[08:46.760 --> 08:50.080]  my start date as an employee was 20 years,
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.920]  but my IDG employee start date was different,
[08:52.920 --> 08:55.240]  and that was like the end of 97
[08:55.240 --> 08:56.560]  or the beginning of 98.
[08:56.560 --> 09:00.440]  And then the buyout happened like around 99 or 2000,
[09:00.440 --> 09:02.880]  so it's a weird situation where I ended up
[09:02.880 --> 09:04.760]  never having to fill out a resume
[09:04.760 --> 09:07.840]  and had worked for three different owners.
[09:07.840 --> 09:10.080]  It's very strange, I only, in the media,
[09:10.080 --> 09:12.120]  I think this crazy stuff like that happened.
[09:12.120 --> 09:14.800]  Right, and you must have been really, really young
[09:14.800 --> 09:15.840]  when you started a Mac user,
[09:15.840 --> 09:17.520]  it must have been right out of college, right?
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.280]  Yeah, I went to, when I finished college,
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.600]  all my friends who got jobs in media
[09:23.600 --> 09:25.520]  were working at weekly newspapers
[09:25.520 --> 09:27.600]  for like $11,000 a year,
[09:27.600 --> 09:28.800]  and I basically said,
[09:28.800 --> 09:30.680]  forget it, I'm not gonna do that,
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.560]  and so I went to journalism school,
[09:32.560 --> 09:35.200]  and although I enjoyed my time at journalism school a lot,
[09:35.200 --> 09:38.000]  the fact is my college newspaper was my journalism school,
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.040]  and I learned how to write news stories and features
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.160]  and edit stories and all of that at the newspaper.
[09:43.160 --> 09:45.440]  The things I learned at Berkeley,
[09:45.440 --> 09:48.160]  journalism school were that I didn't wanna do TV news,
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.680]  because I tried and I didn't like it.
[09:50.680 --> 09:52.680]  And I met, I made contacts,
[09:52.680 --> 09:55.360]  I met people, including one of the editors
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.080]  at Mac user who taught a class there,
[09:57.080 --> 09:58.560]  and she got me an internship.
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.520]  So I was an intern in 93 when I was 22,
[10:03.520 --> 10:05.720]  and I had a job January 94.
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.720]  So yeah, I was 23 when I started full time.
[10:08.720 --> 10:09.720]  So pretty.
[10:09.720 --> 10:11.320]  I think that the historical context
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.080]  that you have to remember is that the 96.97
[10:16.080 --> 10:17.560]  was a terrible time for Apple.
[10:17.560 --> 10:18.400]  It's a worst.
[10:18.400 --> 10:20.120]  And a terrible, even worse,
[10:20.120 --> 10:23.240]  probably even worse than Apple itself was the perception
[10:23.240 --> 10:25.800]  where they really were in trouble.
[10:25.800 --> 10:27.160]  By any objective measure,
[10:27.160 --> 10:30.400]  the company was in serious trouble,
[10:30.400 --> 10:32.840]  both technically and financially.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.720]  But even given that,
[10:34.720 --> 10:37.960]  I think that the general perception was even worse,
[10:37.960 --> 10:41.360]  that it was, I mean, to say doom and gloom,
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.040]  it's not, you can't overstate it,
[10:46.040 --> 10:48.200]  that the perception was true.
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.080]  I remember that.
[10:49.080 --> 10:50.360]  I remember that we would be like,
[10:50.360 --> 10:52.200]  look guys, it's not quite that bad, right?
[10:52.200 --> 10:54.680]  But it was very much, I think about this now.
[10:54.680 --> 10:57.520]  And because Apple is doomed has been a meme
[10:57.520 --> 10:58.360]  that's been around forever
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.160]  and it continues to this day.
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.800]  And on one level, the people who make the arguments today,
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.920]  the facts of what they're arguing tend to be stupid.
[11:07.920 --> 11:09.080]  They're like, that's not really a fact
[11:09.080 --> 11:11.120]  or that you're not looking at the whole picture.
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.040]  But in the back of my mind,
[11:12.040 --> 11:13.600]  I always have that moment of,
[11:13.600 --> 11:15.160]  let's see what they're arguing here
[11:15.160 --> 11:17.040]  because I was present at a time
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.400]  when doom and gloom was happening
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.000]  and there was doom and there was gloom.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.560]  And at the time, it did seem like it was a little overstated.
[11:24.560 --> 11:27.240]  But the fact was that that,
[11:27.240 --> 11:29.520]  I don't think it was overstated in that year,
[11:30.400 --> 11:33.360]  in like 96, 97, in the Gilameleo
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.920]  and them searching for a new operating system
[11:36.920 --> 11:39.360]  and Steve Jobs coming in,
[11:39.360 --> 11:42.040]  that seemed to be the point where they were burning money
[11:42.040 --> 11:43.720]  and not selling a lot.
[11:43.720 --> 11:45.600]  And the clones were eating their lunch
[11:45.600 --> 11:46.760]  in terms of hardware sales.
[11:46.760 --> 11:48.920]  So even their big install base
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.680]  was not really benefiting them.
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.840]  And that was where they were,
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.760]  that was when they were falling apart.
[11:54.760 --> 11:57.320]  And that's the era that you get the kind of,
[11:57.320 --> 11:59.160]  you know, sell the company
[11:59.160 --> 12:01.440]  and give the money back to the shareholders kind of quotes.
[12:01.440 --> 12:03.120]  Is that was a moment where it was unclear
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.160]  whether the executives at that time
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.240]  were gonna listen to the advice of, you know,
[12:10.240 --> 12:13.600]  analysts and pundits and like become a software company
[12:13.600 --> 12:15.600]  and try to be Microsoft Windows
[12:15.600 --> 12:18.200]  and end up being like OS2 and dying.
[12:18.200 --> 12:20.960]  And jobs to his credit, one of the things he did
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.840]  when he came back and it was extremely unpopular
[12:23.840 --> 12:25.440]  was kill the clones and say, no, no, no,
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.000]  we need to control the hardware.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.920]  We're not gonna just be an OS company,
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.280]  we're gonna control the hardware.
[12:30.280 --> 12:33.760]  And that decision actually factored into the publishing companies
[12:33.760 --> 12:37.360]  deciding to fold Mac user into Macworld
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.160]  was all the ad revenue was coming from those clone makers too
[12:41.160 --> 12:42.800]  and that just vanished.
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.520]  Motorola and Power Computing Motorola,
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.160]  Super Mac, which was, I think, U-Max did it,
[12:50.160 --> 12:51.160]  that they called them Super Mac
[12:51.160 --> 12:53.560]  because they got that license from Apple for like scanners
[12:53.560 --> 12:55.360]  but it turned out they could use it for anything
[12:55.360 --> 12:57.440]  so they called, they could call them Super Mac.
[12:57.440 --> 13:00.080]  What was the power, what was the power computing lens called?
[13:00.080 --> 13:01.840]  A Power Tower Power Wave.
[13:03.640 --> 13:05.520]  I had a Power Wave, which was the,
[13:05.520 --> 13:08.520]  which was a, you know, that was my one non-Apple computer
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.280]  that I've ever bought, was the Power Computing Power Wave.
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.480]  Power Tower Pro, they had a whole bunch of power related things.
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.120]  I never owned one, but we had a, I used a couple.
[13:20.120 --> 13:24.520]  It was the Power Wave and the Power Tower Pro,
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.880]  they were way better than the Power Macs of the era.
[13:26.880 --> 13:29.120]  I really do believe, I mean, they were all beige,
[13:29.120 --> 13:30.680]  they were like, they were Apple Gray
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.120]  or you could get Power Computing Beige,
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.000]  but they were all beige boxes, but they were pretty cool.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.400]  They were like, essentially Power Computing was like Dell.
[13:37.400 --> 13:41.000]  I think it was all Dell executives in Austin
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.040]  and they were trying to use Dell, build to order, you know,
[13:44.040 --> 13:45.560]  you order it and then we make it
[13:45.560 --> 13:47.360]  and then we ship it to you technologies
[13:47.360 --> 13:50.840]  to cut their margins and have no inventory.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.680]  And it was a pretty well-run company.
[13:52.680 --> 13:54.960]  I mean, and I guess well-run enough
[13:54.960 --> 13:57.120]  that not only was it really the number one clone maker,
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.840]  but well-run enough that they had enough leverage
[13:58.840 --> 14:01.600]  of some kind that Apple just bought them out,
[14:01.600 --> 14:04.560]  rather than just letting them die out of their products.
[14:04.560 --> 14:05.640]  Or fight them legally, you know.
[14:05.640 --> 14:07.880]  Exactly, because there would have been lawsuits for sure.
[14:07.880 --> 14:10.800]  Because iOS 8, or not iOS 8, see, there we go.
[14:10.800 --> 14:11.880]  MacOS 8.
[14:11.880 --> 14:13.120]  We see, I would have called it,
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.000]  my mistake would have been to call it System 8.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.200]  System 8, sure.
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.520]  MacOS 8 was a major update
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.080]  and what Jobs realized in his people
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.960]  when they came back is that the clone licenses
[14:23.960 --> 14:25.720]  were for System 7.
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.600]  So they basically said, this is OS 8 and you don't get it.
[14:28.600 --> 14:30.560]  And that was how they killed the clones.
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.160]  It was pretty simple, really, nice and clean.
[14:32.160 --> 14:33.880]  And then they ended up paying some people off,
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.000]  including buying the assets of Power Computing.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.920]  Right, because the original plan for MacOS 8
[14:38.920 --> 14:42.520]  was a little bit more ambitious than what it ended up being.
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.000]  It was, more or less, like a nicely cleaned up version
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.520]  of System 7.
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.600]  System 6 went but with the theme to make it look new.
[14:50.600 --> 14:51.920]  Right, right.
[14:51.920 --> 14:54.960]  Never underestimate how much a new window Chrome can make,
[14:54.960 --> 14:57.080]  make it look like something new that it wasn't.
[14:57.080 --> 14:59.400]  But here's the thing, the historical context.
[14:59.400 --> 15:01.080]  So Apple, it wasn't severe trouble.
[15:01.080 --> 15:04.080]  And it's no surprise that Ziff Davis and IDG
[15:04.080 --> 15:05.880]  would make a deal like that.
[15:05.880 --> 15:07.480]  But it is funny, like you said,
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.680]  like people don't remember this.
[15:08.680 --> 15:09.600]  And I was on the outside.
[15:09.600 --> 15:16.400]  I wasn't writing anything for magazines at the time yet.
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.600]  But I was a no surprise, a very avid reader
[15:19.600 --> 15:23.480]  of both Macuser and Macworld all through the 90s.
[15:23.480 --> 15:25.560]  So I was aware of this, but that it
[15:25.560 --> 15:27.800]  was this weird, strange, bedfellows thing
[15:27.800 --> 15:30.600]  where when they unified the two, it
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.160]  was this joint venture between the two arts rival
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.360]  tech publishing companies.
[15:35.360 --> 15:38.680]  With a staff comprised of the two of half of,
[15:38.680 --> 15:41.840]  like literally we're going to lay off half your colleagues.
[15:41.840 --> 15:44.280]  And then we're going to stick you with your arch enemies.
[15:44.280 --> 15:45.480]  Go make a magazine.
[15:45.480 --> 15:46.680]  Good luck.
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.080]  If it wasn't just the owners, it was like the staff.
[15:49.080 --> 15:53.280]  We were the Yankees and the Red Sox, OK.
[15:53.280 --> 15:56.560]  And all of it, because I have to use baseball metaphors
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.960]  when I'm on the talk show.
[15:57.960 --> 15:59.560]  And suddenly they're like, OK, we're
[15:59.560 --> 16:01.840]  going to release half the Yankees and half the Red Sox.
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.000]  And then you're going to have a new team, good luck.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.080]  Make the chemistry work.
[16:05.080 --> 16:07.240]  And it was a disaster, it really was.
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.480]  I was always, and they were very different magazines.
[16:11.480 --> 16:14.040]  I think that from the outside view,
[16:14.040 --> 16:20.040]  Macworld was a little bit more stayed and buttoned up
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.360]  and formal in tone and in coverage.
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.680]  And Macuser was a little bit more casual and more
[16:29.680 --> 16:32.400]  like personal computer, like user centric.
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.160]  Like we're assuming that you're a little bit more likely
[16:35.160 --> 16:38.640]  to be a home user or a student or an enthusiast.
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.800]  And Macworld was a little bit more for the perfect,
[16:41.800 --> 16:43.280]  you're using a Mac at work.
[16:43.280 --> 16:45.280]  Yeah, and it had a more authoritative tone.
[16:45.280 --> 16:47.400]  It was actually, I think the tagline was the Macintosh
[16:47.400 --> 16:49.200]  Authority at one point.
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.960]  And it was the prestige, I mean,
[16:51.960 --> 16:53.800]  it had a bigger staff, it had a bigger budget.
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.360]  Macuser was always a little more homespun, a little more,
[16:58.360 --> 16:59.000]  just as a reader.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.160]  And I was a reader of both.
[17:00.160 --> 17:02.680]  And before I started at Macuser,
[17:02.680 --> 17:06.960]  and it was a little more of the rebels and the users.
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.280]  And people who don't go back that farm,
[17:10.280 --> 17:12.160]  an analog would be something like Mac addict,
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.000]  a little bit.
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.040]  Mac addict was even more so, I think, than Macuser,
[17:16.040 --> 17:18.000]  a rebellious kind of thing.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.680]  But that was definitely the voice difference
[17:20.680 --> 17:23.160]  between Macuser and Macworld.
[17:23.160 --> 17:25.560]  Which is funny, because when you think about it on another level,
[17:25.560 --> 17:27.240]  they were like the two magazines in the US
[17:27.240 --> 17:30.120]  that were monthly, that have roughly the same budget.
[17:30.120 --> 17:31.400]  Macworld was bigger than Mac users,
[17:31.400 --> 17:33.400]  but roughly the same, doing the same thing.
[17:33.400 --> 17:34.960]  They're headquarters at the end there
[17:34.960 --> 17:36.920]  were like two blocks away from each other.
[17:36.920 --> 17:38.360]  So these are, you couldn't find things
[17:38.360 --> 17:39.200]  that were more similar.
[17:39.200 --> 17:40.920]  And yet the output was different
[17:40.920 --> 17:43.080]  and the staffs were different and the culture was different.
[17:43.080 --> 17:44.960]  So it's kind of funny that even though we had
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.480]  all of these things in common,
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.840]  the products were different and the people were different.
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.080]  And I do think too, as an outside observer
[17:53.080 --> 17:54.120]  and someone that was very critical,
[17:54.120 --> 17:56.240]  I thought both were excellent magazines.
[17:56.240 --> 17:57.080]  I agree.
[17:57.080 --> 18:02.080]  Especially compared to the other PC type magazines
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.600]  of the era.
[18:04.600 --> 18:07.360]  We were in the same building as PC computing
[18:07.360 --> 18:10.840]  and there was also PC Mag and PC World.
[18:10.840 --> 18:12.000]  And I didn't read them a lot.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.480]  But yeah, and Macworld was full of,
[18:16.480 --> 18:18.360]  the old Macworld was full of people who really,
[18:18.360 --> 18:20.360]  they wanted to be in the magazine business.
[18:20.360 --> 18:22.560]  And they had high aspirations and you would see it.
[18:22.560 --> 18:24.600]  And Macuser, it was a combination.
[18:24.600 --> 18:26.200]  You'd look at their issues when they'd come out
[18:26.200 --> 18:28.240]  and you'd be like, oh, wow, look what they did with that.
[18:28.240 --> 18:30.960]  Because they did the same stories, a lot of them that we did.
[18:30.960 --> 18:31.920]  There's a new Apple product.
[18:31.920 --> 18:32.760]  How are we gonna do it?
[18:32.760 --> 18:33.600]  How are they gonna do it?
[18:33.600 --> 18:34.720]  And you could just compare,
[18:34.720 --> 18:37.080]  which is like, that is some serious competition.
[18:37.080 --> 18:39.320]  Like you put it to bed and you wait two weeks
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.600]  and then suddenly out of the mailbox comes the competition.
[18:42.600 --> 18:43.440]  What did they do?
[18:43.440 --> 18:44.680]  And did you beat them?
[18:44.680 --> 18:46.120]  Did they beat you?
[18:46.120 --> 18:48.280]  And they would, you would look at some other things
[18:48.280 --> 18:50.840]  and be like, wow, that is they did a really good job.
[18:50.840 --> 18:51.680]  Other times you'd be like,
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.640]  ah, we did them one better.
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.560]  But then at Macworld, what they would really do is
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.120]  they would have these ambitions to do like New York,
[19:01.120 --> 19:03.000]  New York magazine industry kind of stories,
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.920]  bigger picture stories and big features and big ideas.
[19:05.920 --> 19:08.280]  And some of those were real successes for them.
[19:08.280 --> 19:10.920]  And some of those were, I would say failures
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.600]  that were kind of the hubris of like, yeah, we're Macworld,
[19:14.600 --> 19:16.880]  but really we might as well be Vanity Fair.
[19:16.880 --> 19:19.120]  And I think that was a part of their culture there.
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.120]  Where Macworld, Macworld was that and Macuser was more, you know,
[19:25.120 --> 19:27.200]  Apple people who were there because they loved writing
[19:27.200 --> 19:28.280]  about technology.
[19:28.280 --> 19:31.400]  And this is, you know, not entirely true of both staffs,
[19:31.400 --> 19:34.320]  but I would say predominantly there were many more people
[19:34.320 --> 19:36.800]  who loved magazines and were writing at a technology
[19:36.800 --> 19:39.920]  magazine because that was the job at Macworld.
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.960]  And there were more people who were there
[19:41.960 --> 19:44.720]  because they loved the technology and happened to get a job
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.760]  writing about it at a magazine at Macuser.
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.120]  We were more, and you saw it in the end,
[19:49.120 --> 19:51.600]  the people who stuck around covering Apple afterward
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.840]  and writing about tech afterward were mostly people
[19:53.840 --> 19:55.960]  from Macuser and not from Macworld.
[19:55.960 --> 19:57.600]  Yeah, the people from Macworld who I remember
[19:57.600 --> 19:59.480]  who obviously gone on to, you know,
[19:59.480 --> 20:01.960]  continued to do great work.
[20:01.960 --> 20:03.840]  Po, Po was a back page columnist
[20:03.840 --> 20:05.880]  and Stephen, Stephen Levy was,
[20:07.160 --> 20:08.520]  both of which were not on staff.
[20:08.520 --> 20:10.640]  They were, they were freelance columnists,
[20:10.640 --> 20:11.480]  but yeah, it did.
[20:11.480 --> 20:13.480]  It did a lot of the back page columns,
[20:13.480 --> 20:16.080]  which I, you know, was always inspired to be.
[20:16.080 --> 20:17.600]  I got to edit Poog for a while,
[20:17.600 --> 20:18.600]  and that was, that was great.
[20:18.600 --> 20:20.800]  He wrote features for us and he wrote the back page
[20:20.800 --> 20:23.080]  and he was a pleasure to work with.
[20:23.080 --> 20:25.000]  And I still, you know, I still keep in touch with him.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.360]  It was a pleasure to work with Poog.
[20:27.360 --> 20:29.320]  My plan was always to figure out a way
[20:29.320 --> 20:31.200]  that I could get to that back page
[20:31.200 --> 20:33.400]  without having to do any of the grunt work
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.080]  of being a regular editorial staffer
[20:36.080 --> 20:37.240]  for years beforehand.
[20:37.240 --> 20:38.400]  Well, Mr. Complished.
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.440]  And Mr. Complished, I wound up figuring out
[20:41.440 --> 20:42.280]  just such a way.
[20:42.280 --> 20:45.520]  And I would say this, and too,
[20:45.520 --> 20:49.400]  that the person who to me best exemplified
[20:49.400 --> 20:51.920]  the Mac user side of that split in that era
[20:51.920 --> 20:54.360]  was the fact that Andy and Atco was on,
[20:54.360 --> 20:57.160]  was a Mac user writer at the time.
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.400]  And, you know, to talk about another guy who's,
[20:59.400 --> 21:01.720]  you know, never been, you know,
[21:01.720 --> 21:03.640]  still at the top of his game now
[21:03.640 --> 21:06.200]  and still writing about the same stuff.
[21:06.200 --> 21:09.480]  But the way that his, his writing is so infused
[21:09.480 --> 21:10.880]  with his personal style.
[21:10.880 --> 21:12.160]  Right, right.
[21:12.160 --> 21:14.280]  Was very, very Mac user, you know,
[21:14.280 --> 21:15.280]  that we're just gonna let,
[21:15.280 --> 21:16.880]  we've got this nut on our staff
[21:16.880 --> 21:18.520]  and we're just gonna let him fly.
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.960]  Well, I mean, the Mac user was, it was Andy
[21:20.960 --> 21:23.480]  and Chris Brain and Bob Levitis.
[21:23.480 --> 21:27.280]  And I mean, these are people who write with personality.
[21:27.280 --> 21:28.120]  Right.
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.760]  And that was definitely the idea.
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.080]  And when I got to Mac world,
[21:32.080 --> 21:33.480]  that was one of the things that surprised me
[21:33.480 --> 21:36.360]  is that there was a statement that they valued
[21:36.360 --> 21:37.760]  their writers that I heard a lot.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.400]  But it did seem to me that it was also a machine
[21:40.400 --> 21:44.960]  kind of generating a consistent copy.
[21:44.960 --> 21:48.160]  And what you do when you generate consistent copy
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.320]  is you also stamp that voice.
[21:49.320 --> 21:51.560]  And I would say that Mac world was much tighter
[21:51.560 --> 21:53.640]  on that front, but also had less voice.
[21:53.640 --> 21:55.840]  And that user was definitely messier.
[21:55.840 --> 21:58.280]  It was, it was, you know, I would say in fact,
[21:58.280 --> 21:59.880]  you go back and look at old Mac user stuff.
[21:59.880 --> 22:03.320]  And you tell me which Mac user or Mac world,
[22:03.320 --> 22:05.400]  which one would seem more reasonable on a blog today.
[22:05.400 --> 22:07.440]  It's very clear Mac user was in that style.
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.840]  They were much looser and had more voice than Mac wanted.
[22:11.840 --> 22:16.600]  I remember arguing on, with fellow editorial staffers
[22:16.600 --> 22:19.480]  on my college newspaper at Drexel in, you know,
[22:19.480 --> 22:23.440]  this would be 94, 95, 96, about which was better.
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.480]  And the two other guys who really were really, you know,
[22:27.480 --> 22:30.240]  both into writing or pursuing careers and write,
[22:30.240 --> 22:31.600]  you know, thinking about it at least.
[22:31.600 --> 22:33.960]  And were Mac nerds and read both magazines monthly.
[22:33.960 --> 22:36.760]  The other two guys Adam and Andrew were both on them.
[22:36.760 --> 22:38.760]  Oh, come on Mac world's the better magazine.
[22:40.360 --> 22:42.680]  Because I think that they were looking at that, you know,
[22:42.680 --> 22:45.800]  like you said, like it's a little bit more like it's a magazine.
[22:45.800 --> 22:47.680]  Yeah, it's polished and, yeah.
[22:47.680 --> 22:49.480]  Well, Mac user was always very polished.
[22:49.480 --> 22:51.800]  It didn't lack polish, but it, to me,
[22:51.800 --> 22:54.120]  on my argument, remember my argument was it seems to me
[22:54.120 --> 22:57.680]  like the people at Mac user are having more fun doing,
[22:57.680 --> 22:59.680]  they're having more fun putting these issues out.
[22:59.680 --> 23:02.000]  And I was like, why, why would you want to get into this
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.840]  if it wasn't to have fun?
[23:03.840 --> 23:04.680]  Well, that was a great, I mean,
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.720]  I still stay in touch with those people for Mac user
[23:06.720 --> 23:07.680]  and I don't know.
[23:07.680 --> 23:09.480]  I assume that the Mac world people stay in touch too.
[23:09.480 --> 23:10.720]  I really can't speak to that side.
[23:10.720 --> 23:13.440]  But we were, yeah, it was a great, it was a great group of people.
[23:13.440 --> 23:17.520]  And that was, yeah, we were very proud of our product.
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.520]  I would say that it was less polished only in calculated ways.
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.240]  Like you wanted to look a little whackier and be a little messier
[23:28.240 --> 23:30.000]  because that shows the personality.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.640]  But it was not like we didn't know what we were doing.
[23:32.640 --> 23:36.120]  It was like, you know, that was what we were trying to do.
[23:36.120 --> 23:39.400]  It's like a band making an album that sounds raw
[23:39.400 --> 23:40.920]  and not super produced.
[23:40.920 --> 23:44.000]  It's because you want it to, that's the effect that you want.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.960]  And honestly, if you're the number two,
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.480]  then you don't want to pretend to be number one.
[23:49.480 --> 23:50.560]  You want to do something different.
[23:50.560 --> 23:53.240]  And Mac user was very definitely number two to Mac world.
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.720]  So that was what we did.
[23:55.720 --> 23:58.600]  And yeah, it's just funny that in the end,
[23:58.600 --> 24:01.440]  in the end I spent 17 years at Mac world.
[24:01.440 --> 24:02.840]  But if you'd asked me the first three years,
[24:02.840 --> 24:04.160]  I was working in the business, I'd be like,
[24:04.160 --> 24:06.320]  oh, Mac world, I hate those guys.
[24:06.320 --> 24:09.640]  And it ends up being the brand that I'm most associated with
[24:09.640 --> 24:11.840]  in my career, which is just crazy.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.720]  And every now and then on Twitter,
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.480]  I get, there are two things I get.
[24:15.480 --> 24:17.440]  Like it's like there's an alarm that goes off.
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.400]  Every three months or so,
[24:18.400 --> 24:19.760]  somebody sends me a thing saying,
[24:19.760 --> 24:23.600]  is this you at the iPod announcement event?
[24:23.600 --> 24:25.280]  Because there is a reverse shot of the audience
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.960]  a couple of times and I'm in it.
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.080]  I totally, yes, it is me.
[24:29.080 --> 24:30.840]  And the other one that pops up is,
[24:30.840 --> 24:33.240]  hey, I was watching this rerun of friends
[24:33.240 --> 24:37.360]  and Chandler is reading an issue of Mac world.
[24:37.360 --> 24:39.560]  And I thought, you know, and they think of me
[24:39.560 --> 24:40.800]  and they're like, oh, isn't this cool?
[24:40.800 --> 24:42.000]  The Mac world was in friends.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.880]  And I appreciate that because they're thinking of me
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.880]  and connection with the brand.
[24:44.880 --> 24:46.640]  That's great.
[24:46.640 --> 24:48.160]  I was a Mac user with that episode aired
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.880]  and I was so pissed off.
[24:49.880 --> 24:52.640]  It's like, God damn it, why is it Mac world?
[24:52.640 --> 24:53.480]  Right now.
[24:53.480 --> 24:55.320]  Chandler would have been a Mac user guy.
[24:55.320 --> 24:57.800]  Yeah, I know, yeah, could he be more of a Mac user guy?
[24:57.800 --> 24:59.920]  But in the end, now I like, I love it
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.760]  because it's like, yeah, there's a Mac magazine
[25:01.760 --> 25:02.880]  and friends, that's great.
[25:02.880 --> 25:06.000]  And then it would be that guy would read computer magazine.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.200]  That was shorthand for what kind of an early he was.
[25:08.200 --> 25:09.200]  And that's great.
[25:09.200 --> 25:11.800]  But it's funny because that's how far I've come around now
[25:11.800 --> 25:13.800]  is at the time it was just infuriating
[25:13.800 --> 25:18.680]  because our arch enemy got on, must see TV on NBC.
[25:18.680 --> 25:20.480]  And now I look back and it's like, yeah, look,
[25:20.480 --> 25:22.000]  Mac world on friends, that's great.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.920]  It's just, you know, that's what happens.
[25:23.920 --> 25:27.120]  I ended up spending 17 years at what was originally
[25:27.120 --> 25:27.960]  the arch enemy.
[25:27.960 --> 25:30.080]  I imagine that it's not to use another baseball metaphor,
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.360]  but I imagine that's what it's like
[25:31.360 --> 25:32.960]  if you like grew up a Giants fan
[25:32.960 --> 25:34.840]  and then you end up getting drafted by the Dodgers
[25:34.840 --> 25:36.000]  and play for the Dodgers.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.600]  It's like, well, you know, now I'm a Dodger.
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.440]  That's just how it is.
[25:39.440 --> 25:40.280]  I grew up a Giants fan.
[25:40.280 --> 25:41.120]  That's great.
[25:41.120 --> 25:42.080]  But I'm not there anymore.
[25:42.080 --> 25:42.920]  I'm here.
[25:42.920 --> 25:44.600]  Or if it's your son or something, you know,
[25:44.600 --> 25:45.440]  there's something like that.
[25:45.440 --> 25:47.160]  It's like where it just changes your perception
[25:47.160 --> 25:48.160]  after a lot of times.
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.680]  It's like who gives a crap, you know,
[25:49.680 --> 25:51.720]  if your son is playing for the Red Sox,
[25:51.720 --> 25:53.520]  pull your, you know, next day you're going out,
[25:53.520 --> 25:55.280]  you're buying a lot of Red Sox stuff.
[25:55.280 --> 25:56.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:58.120 --> 26:00.240]  And then before we leave the subject,
[26:00.240 --> 26:02.760]  the last thing I wanted to touch on though is that,
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.800]  all right, Apple Terrible Shape, 96, 97 print industry
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.680]  as a whole almost unspeakably high
[26:11.680 --> 26:13.360]  at that time.
[26:13.360 --> 26:15.160]  Like you can't, and you think in hindsight,
[26:15.160 --> 26:16.120]  well, how could that be?
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.880]  Because I think in hindsight,
[26:17.880 --> 26:20.120]  we can all see the writing was on the wall
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.600]  that newspaper and magazine publishers
[26:25.560 --> 26:29.320]  didn't get the internet still don't to a large extent
[26:29.320 --> 26:31.640]  and that it, even if they did,
[26:31.640 --> 26:35.520]  that the way that it was going to affect advertising revenue
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.800]  and the time that people spend reading
[26:37.800 --> 26:39.360]  and how they spend reading it,
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.960]  was all going to be massively disrupted.
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.560]  And you'd think by 97, 98, that that would have been evident,
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.120]  but it wasn't because profits were at an all-time high.
[26:50.120 --> 26:52.400]  And I say this to someone who was at the time
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.080]  working as a graphic designer at the Philadelphia Enquirer.
[26:56.080 --> 26:59.280]  And they had the money was,
[26:59.280 --> 27:00.880]  I mean, that was where all the advertising was.
[27:00.880 --> 27:03.160]  There was momentum on the internet
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.600]  to people were getting interested in it,
[27:04.600 --> 27:05.920]  but there was no money on the internet.
[27:05.920 --> 27:06.760]  That would be crazy.
[27:06.760 --> 27:08.560]  And I had somebody tell me,
[27:08.560 --> 27:10.120]  we're not interested in even doing a web page
[27:10.120 --> 27:11.320]  because the future's on computer.
[27:11.320 --> 27:12.800]  I mean, it was just, they were not,
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.960]  there was so much money in print advertising
[27:14.960 --> 27:16.640]  that like computer shopper,
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.080]  which was also as if Davis property.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.160]  When I was at Siv Davis,
[27:19.160 --> 27:20.840]  that was like a phone book that came out every month.
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.160]  And all it was was ads.
[27:22.160 --> 27:24.720]  There was enough editorial to allow them
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.600]  to use the editorial rate when they shifted
[27:26.600 --> 27:29.280]  in the post postal service.
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.520]  But it was not meant as an editorial product.
[27:31.520 --> 27:32.600]  It was a catalog.
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.880]  And that was just literally,
[27:33.880 --> 27:35.600]  we just made a thing so you could put your ads
[27:35.600 --> 27:37.440]  in this thing and then we'll send it out.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.960]  That was the world then.
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.200]  And the reason why was because the only way
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.560]  that as somebody who is going to be buying external hard drives
[27:45.560 --> 27:50.560]  or scuzzy cables or printer cartridges
[27:50.560 --> 27:54.120]  or all of the various crap that you needed to buy
[27:54.120 --> 27:55.760]  to keep your office running,
[27:57.360 --> 27:59.520]  you needed something like computer shopper
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.200]  so that you could see what was available
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.680]  and what it cost.
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.520]  And we needed it.
[28:04.520 --> 28:06.120]  That was how you shopped for stuff.
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.760]  I mean, when I write when the Macworld thing happened
[28:09.760 --> 28:12.120]  and I was going to XOXO,
[28:12.120 --> 28:14.000]  Neil A. Patel from the Verge sent me an email
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.360]  and said, would you like to write a thing?
[28:15.360 --> 28:17.000]  We're scanning in a bunch of old Macworld covers,
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.280]  would you like to write a thing about the end of Macworld
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.360]  and print and I said, sure.
[28:20.360 --> 28:22.440]  And that was what I ended up going with
[28:22.440 --> 28:24.960]  because I thought, okay, the Verge's audience is pretty young.
[28:24.960 --> 28:27.240]  They may not even remember computer magazines
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.000]  as anything but kind of an oddity you see in an airport
[28:30.000 --> 28:30.840]  or something.
[28:30.840 --> 28:33.600]  And that was the point I made was there was a time when
[28:33.600 --> 28:35.720]  the only way you found out about a new product
[28:35.720 --> 28:38.640]  and the only way you found like what you could buy
[28:38.640 --> 28:40.640]  was by buying a computer magazine.
[28:40.640 --> 28:42.200]  So like the computer magazine would come out
[28:42.200 --> 28:44.640]  and you would pour over the pages
[28:44.640 --> 28:46.120]  to find out what Apple announced
[28:46.120 --> 28:47.320]  or what Microsoft announced
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.560]  or whatever you were interested in.
[28:48.560 --> 28:50.040]  And then in the back you would leave through
[28:50.040 --> 28:52.480]  and be like, you know, what monitor should I get
[28:52.480 --> 28:53.880]  or what cable can I get?
[28:53.880 --> 28:56.040]  And you know, there's an ad here for, you know,
[28:56.040 --> 28:58.920]  1-800-MAX and here's Mac Warehouse over here
[28:58.920 --> 29:01.800]  and Club Mac over there and you pour over that stuff
[29:01.800 --> 29:02.640]  and I did that.
[29:02.640 --> 29:05.560]  I mean, I would go through those issues 10-20 times
[29:05.560 --> 29:08.800]  parsing every sentence about which power book I wanted to buy
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.280]  and parsing every list of products
[29:12.280 --> 29:15.080]  in the different back of the magazine catalogs
[29:15.080 --> 29:18.000]  for the best, you know, the best deal on some accessory
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.840]  and then you'd call an 800 number
[29:19.840 --> 29:21.160]  and give them your credit card
[29:21.160 --> 29:22.040]  and they'd ship it to you
[29:22.040 --> 29:23.440]  and you'd get it like five days later.
[29:23.440 --> 29:26.040]  That was the way the tech world worked
[29:26.040 --> 29:27.680]  and, you know, now it's really different,
[29:27.680 --> 29:30.560]  but back then that magazine was not the only
[29:30.560 --> 29:33.720]  but almost the only conduit for that information.
[29:33.720 --> 29:36.160]  Yeah, people just did not see the disruption coming
[29:36.160 --> 29:39.520]  and then the equivalent for newspapers was classified ads
[29:39.520 --> 29:42.000]  where anything you needed to buy like,
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  you need to rent it,
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.600]  you've got to rent a new apartment, you know,
[29:44.600 --> 29:47.040]  you're roommates are moving out of town
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.680]  and by September you've got to find a new place to live.
[29:49.680 --> 29:53.200]  Well, the only way to do it was to use a newspaper.
[29:53.200 --> 29:56.560]  There was, I mean, there wasn't, there was no plan B.
[29:56.560 --> 29:58.280]  Yeah, it was, it was essentially a monopoly
[29:58.280 --> 29:59.960]  just because of the, you know,
[29:59.960 --> 30:01.080]  they were the only ones,
[30:01.080 --> 30:02.760]  maybe there's an alt weekly.
[30:02.760 --> 30:05.320]  I will say the one thing that I think was a sign
[30:05.320 --> 30:08.440]  in hindsight of the magazine stuff falling apart was
[30:08.440 --> 30:11.720]  all of those catalogs started printing, you know,
[30:11.720 --> 30:14.520]  they started doing all their money into catalogs.
[30:14.520 --> 30:16.080]  It's like, we were gonna print a catalog,
[30:16.080 --> 30:18.400]  all the mail order companies just became catalogs
[30:18.400 --> 30:22.160]  and they took the hit on postage.
[30:22.160 --> 30:24.120]  Although in hindsight, I also think they should have just
[30:24.120 --> 30:26.920]  hired a couple of young editors to wrap enough content
[30:26.920 --> 30:28.320]  around it to call it a magazine,
[30:28.320 --> 30:29.920]  Mac Warehouse magazine.
[30:29.920 --> 30:32.880]  But that, and that actually really put,
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.640]  that was the first time I think that those computer magazines
[30:35.640 --> 30:40.640]  really felt the pain of their ad revenues going down
[30:40.680 --> 30:45.000]  was the catalogs were like a guaranteed seller for them.
[30:45.000 --> 30:46.800]  And then suddenly they would pull out
[30:46.800 --> 30:48.240]  and go back down to a couple of pages
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.080]  because, you know, they would rent the list for Macworld
[30:52.080 --> 30:54.880]  and then send everybody who gets Macworld a catalog.
[30:54.880 --> 30:56.040]  And that was cheaper.
[30:56.040 --> 30:57.360]  And that was less money for Macworld.
[30:57.360 --> 30:58.320]  And that totally happened.
[30:58.320 --> 31:00.000]  So there were some signs, right,
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.200]  that things were starting to break apart.
[31:02.200 --> 31:04.800]  And the computer readers are always gonna be the first one
[31:04.800 --> 31:06.120]  to embrace that new technology.
[31:06.120 --> 31:08.800]  So I always knew that they would be the ones
[31:08.800 --> 31:11.080]  to, we would, we would feel it first.
[31:11.080 --> 31:12.800]  And we totally did.
[31:12.800 --> 31:13.640]  Yeah.
[31:13.640 --> 31:18.480]  And it's, you know, it's the same reason why 10,
[31:18.480 --> 31:20.280]  well, probably more like 15 years ago,
[31:20.280 --> 31:23.840]  when blogs first started percolating up
[31:23.840 --> 31:26.520]  and becoming a thing that so many of them
[31:26.520 --> 31:28.360]  were technology focused.
[31:28.360 --> 31:31.800]  I mean, just an unbelievably disproportionate number
[31:31.800 --> 31:33.920]  of them were technology focused,
[31:33.920 --> 31:37.040]  compared to the interests of the world at large.
[31:37.040 --> 31:40.040]  Because it's the people who are enthusiasts
[31:40.040 --> 31:43.320]  who asked it about technology, who were able to get it up
[31:43.320 --> 31:45.040]  and get a blog up and running.
[31:45.040 --> 31:48.320]  And that's the story of my life, which is I had a nice job
[31:48.320 --> 31:50.680]  at a tech publisher.
[31:50.680 --> 31:52.480]  And so when I wanted to experiment with blogs,
[31:52.480 --> 31:53.800]  I couldn't really write about technology
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.720]  because that was my day job.
[31:54.720 --> 31:57.240]  So, you know, all those great tech blogs being founded then
[31:57.240 --> 31:59.840]  and I did like a stupid TV blog, which was great.
[31:59.840 --> 32:01.880]  And it was early in the days of blogging.
[32:01.880 --> 32:02.720]  And I learned a lot.
[32:02.720 --> 32:04.320]  But that was one of those funny things
[32:04.320 --> 32:07.120]  that I ended up experimenting in all of these other areas
[32:07.120 --> 32:10.160]  because my employer wasn't that interested in experimenting
[32:10.160 --> 32:14.480]  and I was here, that's why I do so many side projects
[32:14.480 --> 32:17.240]  is because for years, my employer wasn't interested
[32:17.240 --> 32:18.440]  in trying those things out.
[32:18.440 --> 32:21.160]  They were looking at where all the money was coming from,
[32:21.160 --> 32:24.000]  which is that that's the core of the innovators dilemma, right?
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.720]  It's very hard to focus on something
[32:25.720 --> 32:28.320]  when there is this giant sack of money right in front of you.
[32:29.440 --> 32:33.160]  Let me take a break and thank first sponsor on this show.
[32:33.160 --> 32:36.560]  I mean, it is our good friends at Backplace.
[32:36.560 --> 32:37.640]  Now you guys know Backplace.
[32:37.640 --> 32:42.320]  Online, unthrottle, unlimited backup for the Mac.
[32:43.440 --> 32:45.480]  And people write to me sometimes
[32:45.480 --> 32:47.440]  because there's frequent sponsor and I say unlimited.
[32:47.440 --> 32:48.280]  What do you mean?
[32:48.280 --> 32:51.200]  And I'm telling you, whatever you've got connected to your Mac,
[32:51.200 --> 32:53.200]  if you've got a three terabyte drive,
[32:53.200 --> 32:55.320]  you've got a six terabyte drive and it's all filled up
[32:55.320 --> 32:58.480]  with junk, backplays will back it all up.
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.320]  Doesn't matter.
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.320]  They don't charge extra if you have more.
[33:01.320 --> 33:03.400]  It just takes longer for the initial backup.
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.600]  That's if there's a catch, that's it.
[33:05.600 --> 33:07.800]  That if you've got six terabytes of stuff to back up,
[33:07.800 --> 33:09.800]  well, it's gonna take a long time to get it back up.
[33:09.800 --> 33:11.760]  Once it's backed up, it's backed up.
[33:11.760 --> 33:16.760]  And then just everything else is incremental after that.
[33:17.600 --> 33:20.120]  You just install Backplace on your Mac.
[33:20.120 --> 33:21.880]  I can't emphasize how simple this is.
[33:21.880 --> 33:24.080]  You install it, you sign up for an account.
[33:24.080 --> 33:26.160]  You don't even have to pay for a month.
[33:26.160 --> 33:28.880]  It's free, it's just try it out.
[33:28.880 --> 33:30.520]  Everything gets backed up.
[33:30.520 --> 33:32.160]  And then what do you do from that point forward
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.000]  to stay backed up?
[33:33.000 --> 33:33.840]  Nothing.
[33:33.840 --> 33:34.520]  You just keep your Mac running
[33:34.520 --> 33:36.400]  and it runs silently in the background
[33:36.400 --> 33:39.960]  and every once in a while, it just uploads what's new,
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.600]  keeps everything in sync.
[33:41.600 --> 33:44.840]  They've got an iPhone app so that you can access your account,
[33:44.840 --> 33:46.680]  which will get you access to anything,
[33:46.680 --> 33:48.600]  any of your files that are backed up in Backplace,
[33:48.600 --> 33:51.920]  you can just grab them from the iPhone app at any time,
[33:51.920 --> 33:53.760]  email them right there from your iPhone
[33:53.760 --> 33:56.480]  or whatever when you're away from your Mac.
[33:56.480 --> 33:59.760]  So it's got plenty of uses that are not just about catastrophic.
[33:59.760 --> 34:02.880]  Oh my God, my whole computer is broken.
[34:02.880 --> 34:04.240]  Whole hard drive froze up.
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.040]  I've got nothing, I need to restore everything.
[34:07.040 --> 34:10.160]  They can deal with that, but it's also useful
[34:10.160 --> 34:12.640]  for just restoring one file at a time
[34:12.640 --> 34:14.480]  when you're on a road at somewhere else
[34:14.480 --> 34:16.160]  and you just need to grab it.
[34:16.160 --> 34:18.160]  Could not be more useful either way.
[34:18.160 --> 34:19.560]  When you do need a full thing,
[34:19.560 --> 34:21.600]  if you need your whole system restored,
[34:21.600 --> 34:23.360]  you don't have to wait to download the whole thing.
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.640]  You can pay a little bit of money
[34:25.640 --> 34:29.200]  and they'll put everything on a USB hard drive
[34:29.200 --> 34:30.480]  and overnight it to you.
[34:30.480 --> 34:32.280]  And then boom, there you are the next day
[34:32.280 --> 34:34.760]  with hard drive with all of your stuff.
[34:35.760 --> 34:37.120]  Unbelievable piece of mine,
[34:37.120 --> 34:39.880]  knowing that you've got everything backed up offline
[34:39.880 --> 34:41.840]  out of your house, out of your office.
[34:44.640 --> 34:46.360]  Where do you go to find out more?
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.560]  I can't believe there's still people
[34:47.560 --> 34:49.280]  who listen to the show who haven't signed up,
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.120]  but here's where you go.
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.440]  Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[34:54.440 --> 34:58.120]  You get a risk-free, no credit card required trial.
[34:58.120 --> 35:01.000]  Just install it, try it, guarantee you, you'll sign up.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.520]  And then after that, here's what you pay.
[35:02.520 --> 35:06.800]  You pay five bucks a month per Mac that you're backing up.
[35:06.800 --> 35:10.520]  That's it, five bucks a month, everything backed up.
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.160]  So my thanks to backblaze.
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.320]  Just a tremendous tremendous service, really.
[35:15.320 --> 35:16.880]  I say it before I say it again.
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.360]  I hope they stop sponsoring the show
[35:18.360 --> 35:20.560]  because everybody who listens to the show
[35:20.560 --> 35:21.960]  signs up for them at some point.
[35:21.960 --> 35:28.960]  Which brings me to a post you had on six colors this week
[35:31.200 --> 35:35.960]  about a sponsorship that didn't go well.
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.720]  Yeah, it was like a, which I say no other gatekeeper
[35:39.720 --> 35:41.600]  but me and you wrote that one of the privileges
[35:41.600 --> 35:44.640]  of being an editor, that before you didn't really
[35:44.640 --> 35:47.760]  have to worry about it, that there really was a separation
[35:47.760 --> 35:51.040]  between editorial and sales, that you just worried about,
[35:51.040 --> 35:52.720]  you guys on the editorial side just worried about
[35:52.720 --> 35:54.960]  what you're gonna write about, and you had a sales staff
[35:54.960 --> 35:55.800]  that sold stuff.
[35:55.800 --> 35:57.320]  And theory sold that.
[35:57.320 --> 35:59.320]  And theory, they could have sold an ad
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.920]  that you guys were somehow uncomfortable with
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.600]  and you could have had a discussion or whatever.
[36:04.600 --> 36:06.640]  But for the most part, you didn't need to worry about it.
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.640]  But now, as one person publishing company, you do.
[36:12.240 --> 36:15.680]  Yeah, there was, it turns out there is a great luxury
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.960]  in being able to be an editor at a large organization
[36:18.960 --> 36:21.760]  and when some ad that is selling,
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.080]  I mean, like a natural, we had a bunch of like DVD ripper apps
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.000]  that were spamming our forums
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.120]  and writing these fake posts, native ad posts
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.240]  about that we're posing as how-tos,
[36:34.240 --> 36:35.320]  but it was for their software
[36:35.320 --> 36:36.840]  and just really awful junkie stuff.
[36:36.840 --> 36:38.880]  And we had the luxury, I mean, behind the scenes
[36:38.880 --> 36:40.680]  we would complain about it, but we also had the luxury
[36:40.680 --> 36:42.840]  of saying, hey guys, it's not us.
[36:42.840 --> 36:44.760]  We have salespeople, they don't tell us what to write
[36:44.760 --> 36:46.640]  and we don't tell them what ads to sell.
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.920]  And when you're in my position and your position,
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.000]  I mean, you've got, right now I don't have anybody selling
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  spots for me, but that might happen down the road.
[37:00.600 --> 37:02.400]  Let me, my recording diet, let me.
[37:03.720 --> 37:05.200]  But I know you've got somebody selling it,
[37:05.200 --> 37:07.040]  but it's still a small operation, it's like you,
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.440]  you've got you and maybe Dave working on ad sales
[37:10.440 --> 37:12.760]  and it comes to you, you're the proprietor,
[37:12.760 --> 37:14.600]  even if you've got somebody selling for you.
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.240]  And with podcasts, it's like this
[37:16.240 --> 37:17.840]  when I have somebody selling an ad in my podcast
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.160]  or you do in yours, you've got, you're the proprietor
[37:21.160 --> 37:22.440]  even if you've got somebody selling it
[37:22.440 --> 37:23.640]  and you have to make that decision.
[37:23.640 --> 37:26.960]  You have to say, yeah, this ad is okay.
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.960]  And so even if it's not, every ad is not a personal
[37:31.960 --> 37:34.720]  endorsement and you can't, I had somebody say that to me
[37:34.720 --> 37:35.960]  and I wrote about it in that post.
[37:35.960 --> 37:38.320]  It's like, I don't, I'm not a developer,
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.520]  but I know I can look at a developer service or tool
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.120]  and say that seems good to me, that seems on the up and up.
[37:44.120 --> 37:45.960]  It fits with the audience.
[37:45.960 --> 37:47.560]  Yeah, you can't have it, you can't have it.
[37:47.560 --> 37:50.400]  Like I know, in theory, it sounds great that you would only
[37:50.400 --> 37:52.680]  take a sponsorship from a service or product
[37:52.680 --> 37:54.160]  that you actually use.
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.440]  And the deck for a while, maybe they still even say that,
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.280]  but then with the deck, it's a big 30 site network
[38:02.280 --> 38:04.560]  and it's not that hard to say that somebody somewhere
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.400]  in the network is using the thing, but when it's just you
[38:08.400 --> 38:10.280]  and it's just me, I can't do that.
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.120]  No, and it's not even fair.
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.800]  Like I use BB at it, I have to code something up,
[38:14.800 --> 38:16.320]  I use BB at it.
[38:16.320 --> 38:19.080]  Would I accept a sponsorship from Coda?
[38:19.080 --> 38:19.920]  Of course I would.
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.320]  Coda's an amazing app from a great company.
[38:23.320 --> 38:26.560]  And in theory, I maybe someday I would use it.
[38:26.560 --> 38:28.280]  I mean, that's to me is my criteria.
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.320]  Is this something that I would recommend because I use it?
[38:31.320 --> 38:34.640]  That criteria isn't, it's too limiting.
[38:34.640 --> 38:37.120]  Is this something that I would recommend readers
[38:37.120 --> 38:39.320]  investigate and consider?
[38:39.320 --> 38:41.800]  Yes, absolutely, that's right, criteria.
[38:41.800 --> 38:43.600]  It has to cross, it has to cross that level
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.840]  and that's harder to define, but it has to cross that level
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.080]  to be something you feel comfortable in on one level.
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.800]  It's just to be comfortable with it
[38:52.800 --> 38:55.040]  and say, I think this is a legitimate product and all that.
[38:55.040 --> 38:56.280]  And again, I don't want to throw the guys
[38:56.280 --> 38:58.320]  under the bus who did that sponsorship, but the fact it,
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.600]  and they have a story and I think part of the problem
[39:00.600 --> 39:03.360]  is there's a language barrier and although I'm skeptical
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.840]  of that product and I was an anti-virus product
[39:05.840 --> 39:07.800]  and it included an iOS component and everybody's like,
[39:07.800 --> 39:10.720]  whoa, a iOS anti-virus that seems really shady to me.
[39:10.720 --> 39:13.360]  And they have, again, they have a marketing story
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.080]  that I think they're not telling effectively,
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.560]  but the bottom line was, I don't believe in iOS anti-virus.
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.440]  I don't think that's a thing and I don't think,
[39:20.440 --> 39:22.320]  I think my audience doesn't think that's a thing
[39:22.320 --> 39:24.360]  and I'm skeptical about Mac anti-virus,
[39:24.360 --> 39:26.320]  but at least I'm a little more open-minded about that
[39:26.320 --> 39:29.480]  than I am about iOS and so when I posted this thing,
[39:29.480 --> 39:32.920]  which I didn't read the stuff closely when I got it
[39:32.920 --> 39:34.440]  because I was traveling and then I put it up
[39:34.440 --> 39:38.040]  and like before as I was going out the door
[39:38.040 --> 39:40.320]  and then people started saying, what the hell is this?
[39:40.320 --> 39:43.600]  And I didn't have an answer for them
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.000]  and that was that moment where I'm like, oh, you know?
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.880]  If I can't conceive of somebody asking me
[39:49.880 --> 39:52.840]  and me having an answer, that's probably not a product.
[39:52.840 --> 39:55.120]  I say, if I'm not comfortable standing by it to that point,
[39:55.120 --> 39:56.560]  not saying I tried it and I like it,
[39:56.560 --> 40:00.120]  but I think this is a reasonable person
[40:00.120 --> 40:01.840]  would think that this product is interesting
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.320]  and you should check it out, that to me would be the difference.
[40:06.320 --> 40:09.560]  And so while sitting in the passenger seat of my car,
[40:09.560 --> 40:12.480]  I didn't, this all blew up while I drove the first leg
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.640]  and my wife drove the second leg
[40:13.640 --> 40:15.680]  and I opened up my phone and I'm like, oh geez.
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.560]  And in the course of about an hour,
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.080]  I responded to the tweets about it,
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.680]  looked more at the company's responses,
[40:26.760 --> 40:28.240]  thought about it a little bit.
[40:28.240 --> 40:29.760]  And then I actually opened up, you know,
[40:29.760 --> 40:33.000]  I opened up Transmit for iOS and edited the include file
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.600]  for the sponsor and my server and I took it out
[40:34.600 --> 40:37.440]  and I deleted their post and I posted the tweet about it
[40:37.440 --> 40:39.160]  and I sent an email to the guy saying,
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.000]  look, I'm gonna, you know, I'll refund your money
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.080]  but I'm not gonna run the ad
[40:43.080 --> 40:44.000]  because I'm not comfortable with it.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.840]  My audience isn't comfortable with it.
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.120]  And I actually got a text from Lex Friedman saying,
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.640]  what if I sell that spot for you?
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.760]  I said, sure, go ahead, if you wanna sell it and he did
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.560]  and I posted the new ad, all from sitting in the passenger
[41:00.560 --> 41:02.640]  seat of my car on my iPhone, which is a pretty fun
[41:02.640 --> 41:04.680]  like technology story.
[41:04.680 --> 41:08.720]  But yeah, it was educational
[41:08.720 --> 41:11.520]  because I couldn't run and hide behind the salespeople.
[41:11.520 --> 41:14.080]  You know, and you're in the exact same boat
[41:14.080 --> 41:16.960]  and Jim Dow ripples in the same boat and all of us
[41:16.960 --> 41:18.840]  who are out here doing this thing,
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.160]  we aren't insulated like that.
[41:21.160 --> 41:22.720]  And so we have to make different rules
[41:22.720 --> 41:24.880]  and there is an expectation that some people have
[41:24.880 --> 41:27.520]  that when we read an ad on a podcast
[41:27.520 --> 41:29.520]  or post a sponsor on our sites,
[41:29.520 --> 41:31.240]  that it's a personal endorsement.
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.920]  And what I always say is if I have used the product,
[41:33.920 --> 41:36.280]  I will, and I want to talk about that,
[41:36.280 --> 41:37.680]  I will talk about it.
[41:37.680 --> 41:40.800]  But your money doesn't buy my personal endorsement,
[41:40.800 --> 41:42.840]  my personal endorsement can't be for sale.
[41:42.840 --> 41:44.080]  That's the flip side of the,
[41:44.080 --> 41:45.880]  not only is it impractical to try every product
[41:45.880 --> 41:47.200]  and not every product is for you,
[41:47.200 --> 41:49.480]  even though you know it's good, the flip side is,
[41:49.480 --> 41:53.400]  I want the freedom to evaluate every product that I want to
[41:53.400 --> 41:55.560]  and if I'm selling evaluations,
[41:55.560 --> 41:57.040]  that calls the whole thing into question.
[41:57.040 --> 41:59.400]  So you have to, you know, those rules are very different
[41:59.400 --> 42:01.200]  than if you're in a big editorial organization,
[42:01.200 --> 42:03.160]  but you still have to kind of come up with the rules
[42:03.160 --> 42:06.640]  and try to disclose them to your audience as best you can,
[42:06.640 --> 42:08.120]  I think, but it was a good lesson for me,
[42:08.120 --> 42:09.120]  I'll tell you that.
[42:09.120 --> 42:14.120]  Yeah, antivirus falls into an interesting crevice,
[42:14.960 --> 42:17.040]  where it's a close call.
[42:17.040 --> 42:22.040]  And I would say that the sibling to antivirus
[42:22.480 --> 42:25.600]  are system cleanup utilities.
[42:25.600 --> 42:26.760]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.560]  And I don't think I've ever taken a sponsorship
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.600]  for antivirus because I really do,
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.920]  I believe strongly that you not only don't need it on a Mac,
[42:40.920 --> 42:43.840]  but that you actually, it will typically cause more harm
[42:43.840 --> 42:44.680]  than good.
[42:44.680 --> 42:47.080]  I really do believe that.
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.760]  And you know, for iOS, it's even more so.
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.280]  I think it's at that point you're talking about snake oil.
[42:53.280 --> 42:56.080]  Now there's possible, you know, I don't know like the case
[42:56.080 --> 42:57.360]  of the sponsor you're talking about.
[42:57.360 --> 43:01.040]  It's possible that you could use something on iOS
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.480]  that would have something to do with antivirus
[43:03.480 --> 43:06.080]  where you're scanning email attachments somehow,
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.920]  I think that's what they're doing is they're scanning
[43:07.920 --> 43:10.240]  attachments in your email and maybe on your Dropbox
[43:10.240 --> 43:12.400]  or stuff like that for viruses,
[43:12.400 --> 43:14.880]  but it's not going to affect your iOS device.
[43:14.880 --> 43:17.280]  Right, it's not so hard for me to come up with a what if
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.920]  scenario where it would have some actual practical utility
[43:20.920 --> 43:24.480]  in theory, but I don't see how it, you know, yeah, exactly.
[43:24.480 --> 43:27.080]  It's not actually doing antivirus at the system level
[43:27.080 --> 43:29.280]  on iOS like what you think of traditionally.
[43:29.280 --> 43:30.800]  And then you simplify the marketing message
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.760]  and it's protect your iPhone and that's not right.
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.160]  And that's I think that's where a lot of this, this comes from.
[43:38.160 --> 43:40.400]  And the cleanup utilities are to me,
[43:40.400 --> 43:43.280]  it's a little bit more like the antivirus to me
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.960]  is a little bit more on the dark side of the gray area
[43:45.960 --> 43:49.280]  and the cleanup utilities are a little bit more on the light side.
[43:49.280 --> 43:52.680]  But I have, I've had sponsors who run, you know,
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.240]  cleanup utilities and I think it's been a while.
[43:56.240 --> 43:58.800]  And I remember somebody on Twitter one time just, you know,
[43:58.800 --> 44:00.360]  they weren't being antagonistic.
[44:00.360 --> 44:02.760]  They weren't trying to jab me,
[44:02.760 --> 44:03.960]  but it was an honest question.
[44:03.960 --> 44:05.800]  They were like, do you use this?
[44:05.800 --> 44:06.920]  Would you recommend it?
[44:06.920 --> 44:09.200]  And I remember thinking like, probably not.
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.880]  And I kind of felt a little like I didn't take the sponsorship back
[44:12.880 --> 44:14.600]  and I don't quite regret it.
[44:14.600 --> 44:16.840]  But it was as close as I've ever come
[44:16.840 --> 44:19.960]  because I just wasn't sure because I don't think a lot
[44:19.960 --> 44:21.520]  of that stuff is all that useful either.
[44:21.520 --> 44:28.160]  I feel like part of the genius of the OS 10 system design
[44:28.160 --> 44:33.160]  is that you don't typically get, the system doesn't degrade
[44:33.200 --> 44:36.600]  over time, which did happen with classic Mac OS.
[44:36.600 --> 44:40.040]  And if you weren't careful and certainly definitely
[44:40.040 --> 44:40.880]  happens with Windows.
[44:40.880 --> 44:42.920]  They want to Mac, I mean, so many of these things happen
[44:42.920 --> 44:44.800]  because it's like, oh, we have a Windows product,
[44:44.800 --> 44:47.240]  we have an Android product, we need Apple products
[44:47.240 --> 44:48.760]  and they can't really do much,
[44:48.760 --> 44:51.960]  but they want to have that spread of products.
[44:51.960 --> 44:53.880]  And so they come out with one, although, you know,
[44:53.880 --> 44:56.800]  cleanup, especially with SSDs, there's totally,
[44:56.800 --> 44:57.880]  and they may be out there,
[44:57.880 --> 45:00.120]  but there's totally a good case to be made for cleanup
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.520]  that's doing smart things like you've got preferences
[45:02.520 --> 45:05.400]  from apps from 2004 that you migrated
[45:05.400 --> 45:08.640]  and you've got duplicate files in all these different places
[45:08.640 --> 45:10.560]  and you've got iTunes Match turned on,
[45:10.560 --> 45:13.960]  but so I could save a lot of space by deleting
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.920]  your music folder stuff like that.
[45:17.920 --> 45:20.160]  There is an argument to be made, but you're right,
[45:20.160 --> 45:21.320]  then you get in the details and you're like,
[45:21.320 --> 45:24.080]  yeah, do I really believe in this particular product enough
[45:24.080 --> 45:25.960]  to not enough to endorse it,
[45:25.960 --> 45:28.120]  but enough to expose my audience to it?
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.800]  Because there is some understanding between us
[45:32.800 --> 45:37.600]  and our audiences that some of the stuff's gonna be vetted,
[45:37.600 --> 45:38.440]  at least, right?
[45:38.440 --> 45:39.640]  It's on the up and up, right?
[45:39.640 --> 45:41.920]  Not necessarily we endorse it and use it personally,
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.960]  but it's on the up and up.
[45:42.960 --> 45:44.480]  And I think that's right.
[45:44.480 --> 45:47.440]  I think they should expect that from us.
[45:47.440 --> 45:49.840]  The next, I don't know,
[45:49.840 --> 45:51.320]  because it dates all the way back to next,
[45:51.320 --> 45:56.320]  but that co-co preferences system is so brain dead,
[45:56.400 --> 45:57.720]  super simple.
[45:57.720 --> 46:01.840]  It's not genius because it's this complicated,
[46:01.840 --> 46:06.520]  genius system, it's genius because it is just simple,
[46:06.520 --> 46:07.760]  it's like one of the simplest,
[46:07.760 --> 46:09.240]  stupidest things they could do,
[46:09.240 --> 46:12.040]  where each app has a unique identifier
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.640]  and they just use domain name,
[46:13.640 --> 46:18.640]  so like barebones, it's comm.bearbones.be be at it.
[46:18.640 --> 46:23.640]  Dot p-list, and that file goes in your library preferences folder,
[46:25.200 --> 46:26.720]  and it's guaranteed to be unique
[46:26.720 --> 46:29.120]  because that domain name belongs to barebones,
[46:29.120 --> 46:30.600]  so they get to control that.
[46:30.600 --> 46:33.640]  There's comm.apple.mail for mail,
[46:33.640 --> 46:38.040]  and it's just a file, and the app reads from that file,
[46:38.040 --> 46:39.960]  and that's where your preferences are stored.
[46:39.960 --> 46:42.520]  And if you delete BB at it,
[46:42.520 --> 46:45.800]  and that comm.bearbones.delete the app,
[46:45.800 --> 46:47.320]  that file is sitting there,
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.120]  it's only a couple of hundred kilobytes,
[46:49.120 --> 46:50.680]  and it never gets in the way.
[46:50.680 --> 46:52.680]  It's not like a database that's getting gummed up,
[46:52.680 --> 46:55.040]  it's just a file that's in the folder,
[46:55.040 --> 46:57.080]  and there is no harm.
[46:57.080 --> 47:00.720]  So if you've tried 50 different text editors,
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.200]  and then settled on one, those 49 preferences files
[47:04.200 --> 47:05.400]  in your preferences folder,
[47:05.400 --> 47:07.240]  don't slow a damn thing down.
[47:07.240 --> 47:11.720]  No, it's gonna be when you've got a Dolby CS4 and CS6 in there.
[47:11.720 --> 47:13.480]  Or on the other hand, like something like,
[47:13.480 --> 47:14.960]  well, I never use GarageBand,
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.440]  so I'll delete the GarageBand app.
[47:16.440 --> 47:19.800]  Well, GarageBand has like a 400 megalloops,
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.200]  and loops and instruments are enormous.
[47:22.200 --> 47:23.200]  There's, yeah, there's,
[47:23.200 --> 47:26.720]  so there's like a huge application support folder,
[47:26.720 --> 47:29.400]  relatively huge compared to most apps, that, you know,
[47:29.400 --> 47:32.720]  and again, if you're on an SSD, and space is at a premium,
[47:32.720 --> 47:37.720]  because, you know, like the default SSD is still like 256 gigabytes,
[47:38.760 --> 47:41.160]  you could save some serious space,
[47:41.160 --> 47:44.160]  and it's hidden away now that the library folder
[47:44.160 --> 47:47.800]  is invisible by default for most, you know,
[47:47.800 --> 47:50.600]  for new user accounts.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.120]  It's not something, you know,
[47:53.120 --> 47:54.800]  I can see how a cleaning utility
[47:54.800 --> 47:56.640]  could actually help like a typical user
[47:56.640 --> 47:59.800]  if it was carefully written, and, you know,
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.680]  but it's a borderline call.
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.680]  Can I tell you about my favorite preference, joke?
[48:06.680 --> 48:11.200]  Haha, Adobe, of course, is the answer.
[48:11.200 --> 48:13.240]  There is, in my, and maybe in yours too,
[48:13.240 --> 48:15.680]  I don't know, in my user library folder,
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.400]  so tilde slash library, there's a folder,
[48:19.400 --> 48:20.960]  there's the application support folder, right?
[48:20.960 --> 48:23.040]  Which is where you're supposed to write all your folders,
[48:23.040 --> 48:25.080]  or write your, your preference files.
[48:25.080 --> 48:28.320]  I also have a folder in my library called
[48:28.320 --> 48:31.920]  application support slash Adobe slash acrobat.
[48:31.920 --> 48:33.320]  That's the name of the folder.
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.000]  Haha, I don't have that.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.600]  I don't even know, I didn't even know that was allowed
[48:39.600 --> 48:41.840]  to have slashes in a, in a folder name,
[48:41.840 --> 48:43.680]  but somehow they did it.
[48:43.680 --> 48:46.000]  You magnificent bastards, you did it.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  And I just, it makes me, I wanted to lead it,
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.360]  and yet every time I see it, it just makes me laugh.
[48:51.360 --> 48:53.200]  It's like how incompetent is that?
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.600]  Haha, yeah, good job.
[48:55.600 --> 48:57.920]  You're in the application support folder, totally.
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.760]  Nailed it.
[48:59.960 --> 49:01.920]  I'll send you a screenshot.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.040]  It's, it's super nerdy.
[49:06.400 --> 49:08.640]  But that was actually when, when,
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.520]  when the next acquisition was made,
[49:12.520 --> 49:13.360]  and,
[49:17.400 --> 49:18.400]  and they were gonna do the,
[49:18.400 --> 49:21.160]  well, we're gonna, we're gonna make one operating system
[49:21.160 --> 49:22.280]  with the best of everything.
[49:22.280 --> 49:23.880]  One of the problems was next
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.440]  was a traditional Unix system that you slash
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.120]  as the directory separator.
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.960]  So slash was not, again, maybe you could do it with a backslash.
[49:33.960 --> 49:36.120]  But you know, slash was something that you couldn't put
[49:36.120 --> 49:39.560]  into a, you know, file name or folder name.
[49:39.560 --> 49:41.600]  Right, you try to type it and it would give you a minus
[49:41.600 --> 49:42.440]  or something.
[49:42.440 --> 49:47.440]  Right, but HFS, that will just format,
[49:48.640 --> 49:49.480]  what would you call it?
[49:49.480 --> 49:53.080]  Or Syracuse, who I need to, well, whatever, the HFS,
[49:53.080 --> 49:56.640]  use file system, file system, used colon.
[49:56.640 --> 49:57.840]  colon was the separator.
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.840]  So you couldn't type a colon in the name.
[49:59.840 --> 50:01.560]  So you could type slashes.
[50:01.560 --> 50:03.880]  And so also, you know, like a publication,
[50:03.880 --> 50:06.760]  you might reach an issue of a newspaper,
[50:06.760 --> 50:08.680]  you know, like a weekly newspaper.
[50:08.680 --> 50:10.960]  I think maybe we did, you know,
[50:10.960 --> 50:11.800]  we call each other.
[50:11.800 --> 50:13.080]  We did some in that world, yeah.
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.000]  Yeah, it would be like, you know,
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.200]  month slash, we, or you know,
[50:18.200 --> 50:21.400]  month or year slash month slash date, you know,
[50:21.400 --> 50:22.240]  and that would be it.
[50:22.240 --> 50:23.800]  And so we had all these things that,
[50:26.360 --> 50:28.480]  slashes in the actual file names.
[50:28.480 --> 50:30.360]  And there was, and it just seemed like,
[50:30.360 --> 50:32.120]  well, something's gotta give here,
[50:32.120 --> 50:35.240]  but there was a white paper, oh, God,
[50:35.240 --> 50:38.320]  I forget who wrote it, but I met him.
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.240]  There was an ex-engineer who wrote a white paper
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.640]  figuring out a way to conveniently solve it.
[50:42.640 --> 50:44.920]  And the bottom line, me, you know,
[50:44.920 --> 50:48.120]  the bottom line is the penalty we had to pay
[50:48.120 --> 50:50.920]  is that you can't have a colon or a slash in a file name.
[50:52.200 --> 50:55.000]  For real, but you can, it looks like you have a slash
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.480]  in a file name.
[50:56.480 --> 50:59.400]  It somehow is fake.
[50:59.400 --> 51:01.400]  Like when it looks like you have a slash in a file name,
[51:01.400 --> 51:02.440]  it's not a slash.
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.280]  I love it, but it all worked out.
[51:06.280 --> 51:07.920]  It actually did work out.
[51:07.920 --> 51:10.040]  We had that, we had a catastrophe
[51:10.040 --> 51:11.680]  where we did that.
[51:11.680 --> 51:14.560]  We at some point at Macworld changed our file name format
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.840]  that used to be, you know,
[51:16.840 --> 51:18.520]  the volume number and the issue number.
[51:18.520 --> 51:21.680]  So it would be like 16 slash 04,
[51:21.680 --> 51:23.560]  and that was the, whatever that was,
[51:23.560 --> 51:27.560]  April of what's 84 plus 16, right?
[51:27.560 --> 51:30.680]  April 2000 issue.
[51:30.680 --> 51:32.440]  And when Noah's 10 happened,
[51:32.440 --> 51:35.920]  we moved to multi-dashes because we were afraid,
[51:35.920 --> 51:37.160]  because there was a period where Noah's 10
[51:37.160 --> 51:38.920]  would not let you input the slash.
[51:38.920 --> 51:42.880]  It would, it would transmogrify it on the fly to a dash
[51:42.880 --> 51:44.960]  because dashes were dangerous.
[51:44.960 --> 51:46.560]  And to this day, my Apple scripts,
[51:46.560 --> 51:47.840]  I have to do a lot of, you know,
[51:47.840 --> 51:52.000]  POSIX path stuff because if you get,
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.640]  if you get an alias in the finder,
[51:53.640 --> 51:56.120]  it comes in with colon delimited.
[51:56.120 --> 51:58.880]  And then there are other tools that want it as,
[51:58.880 --> 52:00.880]  as a Unix path, a POSIX path.
[52:00.880 --> 52:05.080]  And you have to do like POSIX path of alias
[52:05.080 --> 52:06.560]  in order to get it in the right format
[52:06.560 --> 52:09.320]  so that you can send it to a script or something.
[52:09.320 --> 52:12.800]  Yeah, I don't think anybody is more familiar
[52:12.800 --> 52:16.960]  with the crazy rules over how to specify
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.880]  HFS versus Unix style past
[52:18.880 --> 52:20.760]  than anybody who's written any Apple script.
[52:21.760 --> 52:22.960]  It's like, why is this not working?
[52:22.960 --> 52:24.720]  And they're like, oh, right.
[52:24.720 --> 52:26.480]  Now it needs to be a Unix path.
[52:26.480 --> 52:29.520]  Or because inevitably with Apple script,
[52:29.520 --> 52:31.600]  boy, we are in the weeds now,
[52:31.600 --> 52:34.640]  you use do shell script,
[52:34.640 --> 52:36.680]  which is an incredible boon to Apple script
[52:36.680 --> 52:39.520]  to be able to just basically fire off a Unix script
[52:39.520 --> 52:40.680]  and get a result back.
[52:40.680 --> 52:42.320]  It's great.
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.520]  But if you're using something a file you got in the finder,
[52:45.520 --> 52:48.280]  the Unix shell script doesn't understand those colons.
[52:48.280 --> 52:50.400]  So you need to convert it and then you send it off.
[52:50.400 --> 52:56.440]  And so that, yeah, that happens all the time.
[52:56.440 --> 52:58.280]  We are definitely often the weeds.
[52:58.280 --> 53:00.160]  Yeah, yeah, I do that with Markdown.
[53:00.160 --> 53:02.560]  Actually, that was one of the things I would always do is
[53:02.560 --> 53:04.440]  I'd like grab something and run it through Markdown
[53:04.440 --> 53:06.120]  and get the results back and all that.
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.720]  You got to get the file names right.
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.840]  So where were we talking about before we went off on the file system?
[53:12.840 --> 53:14.920]  Oh, wow.
[53:14.920 --> 53:16.440]  Old days.
[53:16.440 --> 53:18.120]  Next, you were talking about next engineers,
[53:18.120 --> 53:19.200]  God, what was it?
[53:19.200 --> 53:21.080]  We've to back up a little.
[53:21.080 --> 53:23.200]  Sponsors, sponsored conflicts.
[53:23.200 --> 53:24.080]  I think that's where we were.
[53:24.080 --> 53:25.720]  Yeah, I think that's probably it.
[53:25.720 --> 53:28.320]  I remember in the early days of doing
[53:32.600 --> 53:36.440]  sponsorships at Daring Fireball, weekly ones
[53:36.440 --> 53:38.000]  that I was selling myself.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.840]  The first conflict that I can remember having was,
[53:40.840 --> 53:42.160]  and this was at the time, do you remember
[53:42.160 --> 53:46.480]  for a brief period there was some controversy over app bundles?
[53:46.480 --> 53:48.360]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, definitely.
[53:48.360 --> 53:50.960]  You know, like, those, you would.
[53:50.960 --> 53:52.240]  That would be a nice, and all of that.
[53:52.240 --> 53:53.720]  Yeah, like, I'm not really doing all those things.
[53:53.720 --> 53:54.920]  Yeah, Mac Heist.
[53:54.920 --> 53:57.680]  And I had come out sort of against them
[53:57.680 --> 54:00.880]  as sort of devaluing software, at least the extreme ones
[54:00.880 --> 54:04.160]  where you were getting an inordinate amount of software
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.120]  for a seemingly absurd low price.
[54:08.120 --> 54:11.160]  And then a bundle wanted to sponsor Daring Fireball.
[54:11.160 --> 54:11.520]  Right.
[54:11.520 --> 54:15.240]  And I don't know.
[54:15.240 --> 54:17.240]  I was very, I can't remember which bundle it was,
[54:17.240 --> 54:19.520]  but I was very conflicted because I felt like,
[54:19.520 --> 54:22.280]  on the one hand, I've just written against them.
[54:22.280 --> 54:25.320]  But on the other hand, you know, it's a good deal.
[54:25.320 --> 54:27.400]  It is what it is, you know, and nobody, you know,
[54:27.400 --> 54:29.480]  it's not like the bundles were putting these apps
[54:29.480 --> 54:31.840]  into the bundles without their permission.
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.840]  It was, you know, and I think I wound up going with it.
[54:37.720 --> 54:38.560]  I did it.
[54:38.560 --> 54:40.800]  I took it because I thought, you know, it's,
[54:40.800 --> 54:45.800]  in some sense you have to be the publisher,
[54:48.160 --> 54:50.480]  you know, every publication, there never really was
[54:50.480 --> 54:53.120]  a wall between editorial and advertising,
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.040]  even in a big organization.
[54:55.040 --> 54:58.360]  It might have seemed like a wall in the trenches.
[54:58.360 --> 54:59.200]  Yes, yeah.
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.680]  But eventually you work up the chain
[55:01.680 --> 55:04.120]  and there's a person whose responsibility,
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.440]  you know, typically their title was like publisher.
[55:06.440 --> 55:09.160]  Like certainly newspaper industry, that was the title.
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.040]  Is somebody who is concerned with both things?
[55:13.040 --> 55:14.480]  Yeah, and for me, I mean, that's what I always said
[55:14.480 --> 55:17.200]  about my job is that I sat on the top of the wall.
[55:17.200 --> 55:19.480]  And it's like, I got to shield my people from the stuff
[55:19.480 --> 55:20.840]  that was happening on the other side of the wall
[55:20.840 --> 55:21.680]  as best I could.
[55:21.680 --> 55:24.120]  But my boss was the president of the company
[55:24.120 --> 55:27.600]  and the head of, was either the head of sales themselves
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.600]  or the head of sales reported to them.
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.920]  And at that level, you know, there were always conversations.
[55:33.920 --> 55:36.200]  Now, again, my job was to kind of steer them
[55:36.200 --> 55:38.920]  in the right direction and protect my people from it.
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.920]  But, you know, ultimately, yes, if you have a business
[55:45.080 --> 55:46.920]  that business people are gonna have demands
[55:46.920 --> 55:47.760]  that they're gonna wanna make.
[55:47.760 --> 55:50.840]  And then it becomes part of the game to negotiate
[55:50.840 --> 55:54.480]  and get things back in a place that everybody can live with.
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.600]  That is not, you know, hinky for that tutorial side.
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.960]  That is, that was always part of my job up at the top.
[55:59.960 --> 56:02.480]  It's just harder, you know, what you're saying.
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.760]  It's like, now it's all exposed.
[56:03.760 --> 56:05.280]  It's just, it's this guy.
[56:05.280 --> 56:06.440]  It's you, you're the guy.
[56:06.440 --> 56:07.880]  You gotta, you gotta do it.
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.640]  You gotta, you gotta make that decision.
[56:09.640 --> 56:10.480]  Right.
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.120]  But overall, you know, in seven years,
[56:16.120 --> 56:19.880] ish, seven to eight years of selling weekly sponsorships,
[56:19.880 --> 56:22.200]  there've been very few times where it's come up.
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.680]  I mean, and they've even been very few times
[56:24.680 --> 56:27.320]  that I've had to reject a sponsor.
[56:27.320 --> 56:28.720]  Seems like they know.
[56:28.720 --> 56:30.920]  Well, I'm hoping, yeah, I'm hoping that,
[56:30.920 --> 56:32.320]  that actually is a part of this.
[56:32.320 --> 56:34.000]  It's, it's partly me.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.320]  And it's also partly just in the environment
[56:37.320 --> 56:39.720]  that it's, I'm hoping it doesn't happen.
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.640]  This was one out of like 16, it's not even that,
[56:43.640 --> 56:46.400]  what 12 weeks, one out of 14 weeks, something like that.
[56:46.400 --> 56:47.240]  Well, and like I said,
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.640]  I really do think that the antivirus
[56:49.640 --> 56:52.040]  and cleaning utilities are sort of,
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.480]  especially, and I said darker side is the antivirus
[56:55.480 --> 56:58.240]  are an exception that there are.
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.200]  I can't think of any other topic, you know,
[57:01.200 --> 57:03.560]  it's sort of advertiser that's in that area.
[57:03.560 --> 57:05.600]  Well, I could see, and again,
[57:05.600 --> 57:06.920]  I don't think I would come down on the side
[57:06.920 --> 57:07.960]  and not running an ad for them,
[57:07.960 --> 57:09.240]  but you know, there are a lot of,
[57:09.240 --> 57:11.600]  there are a lot of memes that go through our,
[57:11.600 --> 57:14.640]  our community and our audiences as they,
[57:14.640 --> 57:16.200]  and they're all interconnected, right?
[57:16.200 --> 57:17.280]  I have this thing with six colors
[57:17.280 --> 57:18.200]  where I see you post a link
[57:18.200 --> 57:19.720]  and I'm like, well, I could post a link to that,
[57:19.720 --> 57:21.000]  but everybody's reading John's site,
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.080]  so do I even need to bother
[57:22.080 --> 57:23.320]  or should I just link to John's link
[57:23.320 --> 57:25.520]  and say just read John's link about it?
[57:25.520 --> 57:28.680]  You know, we are all kind of in the same ecosystem together.
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.440]  And there are some of the memes that come out,
[57:30.440 --> 57:31.440]  like there's the whole, you know,
[57:31.440 --> 57:32.520]  if you're not paying for the product
[57:32.520 --> 57:35.240]  then you're the, you're what they're selling.
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.280]  And I could see something like that coming up
[57:38.280 --> 57:40.880]  where there's some product that is going to sponsor you
[57:40.880 --> 57:42.240]  and what they're really wanting.
[57:42.240 --> 57:43.960]  Obviously it's free and isn't it great
[57:43.960 --> 57:45.480]  and I could see people being like,
[57:45.480 --> 57:47.400]  hey, that's, you know, that's no good.
[57:47.400 --> 57:49.080]  There's this other developer who's trying to sell it.
[57:49.080 --> 57:50.120]  These guys are doing it free
[57:50.120 --> 57:51.520]  and they're just going to get our information
[57:51.520 --> 57:52.360]  and all of that.
[57:52.360 --> 57:53.520]  I could see scenario like that,
[57:53.520 --> 57:56.320]  although it doesn't seem to have come up up to now,
[57:56.320 --> 57:57.680]  but I could see something like that
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.760]  that would be unpopular with a part of the community
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.200]  because it seems to be the kind of thing
[58:04.200 --> 58:05.640]  that we all rail against,
[58:05.640 --> 58:07.840]  like what you were saying about the app bundles thing.
[58:07.840 --> 58:09.960]  But I think it's encouraging
[58:09.960 --> 58:12.680]  that you haven't seen a lot of that and that's good.
[58:12.680 --> 58:14.840]  But I think it's worth, you know,
[58:14.840 --> 58:16.040]  this is so inside baseball,
[58:16.040 --> 58:17.240]  but I think it's worth people hearing
[58:17.240 --> 58:19.160]  that it's not like we don't think about these issues
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.240]  and take them seriously.
[58:20.240 --> 58:22.560]  And honestly, I think that's one of the downsides
[58:22.560 --> 58:25.040]  of the big organizations with the separations
[58:25.040 --> 58:27.680]  of church and state is there's a clear message
[58:27.680 --> 58:29.640]  and I think people even get trained to expect it
[58:29.640 --> 58:33.880]  from everybody, which is, you know, we don't care.
[58:33.880 --> 58:35.800]  That's like the editors are the ones you talk to.
[58:35.800 --> 58:36.880]  They have no power.
[58:36.880 --> 58:39.040]  You never talk to the salespeople.
[58:39.040 --> 58:40.480]  The organization doesn't really care
[58:40.480 --> 58:43.840]  unless it's a serious black eye for the organization.
[58:43.840 --> 58:45.640]  And so, you know, why even bother,
[58:45.640 --> 58:48.200]  there's just gonna be credit stuff that gets advertised.
[58:48.200 --> 58:50.440]  And with us, you know, we do take it seriously
[58:50.440 --> 58:52.720]  and that's not true, that's not how we want it to be.
[58:52.720 --> 58:54.600]  I mean, there's also a reason that our sites
[58:54.600 --> 58:58.840]  don't have junk all over them because that's crappy,
[58:58.840 --> 59:02.480]  but big organizations have no problem littering their sites
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.680]  with junk.
[59:04.680 --> 59:08.080]  Jay Rosen, who's teaches journalism at NYU
[59:08.080 --> 59:11.800]  and is a, you know, big presence.
[59:11.800 --> 59:15.200]  And when you're in sort of the whole inside baseball world
[59:15.200 --> 59:16.840]  of online journalism.
[59:16.840 --> 59:19.120]  But I mean, I think he said I wanna put words in his mouth
[59:19.120 --> 59:22.360]  but something to the effect of if you work at a publication
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.720]  doesn't matter whether it's print or online or both
[59:24.720 --> 59:26.760]  or whether it's new or old.
[59:26.760 --> 59:29.200]  But if it's big enough, you know,
[59:29.200 --> 59:31.280]  that it's not just like a one person thing, but it's big
[59:31.280 --> 59:36.120]  and you can be isolated and just concentrate on editorial.
[59:36.120 --> 59:38.880]  If you don't understand the business model
[59:38.880 --> 59:42.520]  of the publication, you're screwed.
[59:42.520 --> 59:45.760]  You're not being responsible and you're probably screwed.
[59:45.760 --> 59:47.760]  Yeah, well, the way he phrases you should quit your job
[59:47.760 --> 59:49.520]  which is probably a little extreme,
[59:49.520 --> 59:54.280]  but he's not wrong that you should understand why
[59:54.280 --> 59:55.640]  your company does what it does
[59:55.640 --> 59:57.040]  and what decisions they're making
[59:57.040 --> 59:58.480]  and whether they're good or not.
[59:58.480 --> 1:00:02.600]  And, you know, I, over the years,
[1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:04.320]  I have been fortunate to work with a bunch
[1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:06.200]  of incredibly talented people.
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:10.640]  But what I will say is I was always surprised
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:14.960]  at how some incredibly intelligent, talented people
[1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:18.240]  would have no conception about how parts
[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:19.880]  of our business worked.
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:24.040]  Even though some of that was communicated fairly clearly
[1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:25.920]  and some of that has to do with frame of reference
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.360]  and some of that has to do with not wanting to hear it
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:30.080]  because if you're trained as a journalist
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:32.520]  and you hear from the sales guys or the business people,
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:33.920]  it's very easy to put that in a box
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:35.080]  just like that's not my concern.
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:37.640]  In fact, it's my duty to not even pay attention to that.
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:40.040]  But it always surprised me that I would hear
[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:41.640]  even up to the end.
[1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:43.080]  And one of the things Rosen points out too
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  is that you need to know the difference
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:46.400]  between what product people refer to as product
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.200]  and what editorial people refer to as product,
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:49.600]  which is super important
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.840]  because the media today, so much of what happens
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:54.320]  at these sites is based on the product roadmap
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.000]  and product managers and developers
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.880]  and the product is not just the words on the website.
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:00.800]  The product is the features of the website
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:02.080]  and the design of the website
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:05.960]  and tools that editors can use to build things on the website.
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:09.160]  And if you're thinking of the product as being what you write
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:13.760]  or as product as being some weird amorphous sales thing,
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:17.080]  you have a really distorted view of what your business is
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:21.280]  and that's probably not a healthy place to be.
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:23.640]  And I would have that where I would have people talking
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:28.640]  about HR or developers or marketing people,
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:30.720]  people who not in ad sales
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.320]  and people who'd been at the company for a long time
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:37.400]  would say, oh, well, those are sales people.
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:38.960]  It's like, no, they're not sales people.
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:42.400]  They're other parts of the business that aren't editorial
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:44.240]  but they're not sales people.
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.560]  And I understand why people would cultivate a simplified view
[1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:50.280]  in the sense of like, I just don't wanna hear it.
[1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:51.680]  I don't wanna know about it.
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:53.840]  But in reality, I think it is a good thing
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.840]  to know about that stuff and understand it
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:57.160]  and understand your place in it.
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:59.080]  And then if it doesn't make you comfortable,
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:00.960]  it certainly makes you a better judge of whether
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.640]  the decisions your business is making are solid
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:06.000]  or bad or desperate.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.920]  And if you are in any position to determine
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:12.640]  what kind of stuff is gonna go in the product, right?
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:16.000]  Then knowing where your business is going could actually help,
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.440]  you could actually get some good ideas
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:20.240]  or helps have a bigger voice in deciding
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.680]  what gets built next.
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:25.840]  So I thought that piece while a little bit
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:28.200]  hypey and saying you should quit your job
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.080]  is a little bit rich.
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:32.000]  He's not wrong about a lot of those points
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.360]  that you really should understand the business
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:34.760]  that you're in.
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:38.680]  Yeah, I think he has a sort of better
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:42.160]  to overstate it than understated style.
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:47.320]  Yeah, without going into sensationalism.
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:49.160]  And while I'm trying to communicate some of this stuff,
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:50.880]  I mean, like I said, some of this,
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:53.440]  you're trying to battle against la la la,
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:54.960]  I don't wanna hear it, it's not my job,
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:56.480]  it's in a business side, I'm an editor,
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:57.360]  I don't need to hear it.
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:59.520]  So you kind of do need to shout sometimes
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:01.640]  and say, no, no, no, pay attention to this,
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:02.920]  especially something like the difference
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.960]  between what product.
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:07.040]  I mean, that's come up in a bunch of cases
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:10.240]  where people have angrily left various website startups
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:11.400]  who are editorial people.
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:13.600]  They're like, oh, they're just in it for the product.
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:16.800]  And it's like, I dealt with, at the end there at IDG,
[1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.960]  I worked with a really great product manager
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:21.160]  and he and I spent a lot of time talking about ways
[1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:22.480]  we could improve the product.
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:25.040]  Unfortunately, most of those things never got prioritized
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:27.360]  but that was a great experience
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:30.440]  because we were working together editorial
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:33.080]  and product management to identify things
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:34.840]  that would make the website better.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:37.600]  And sometimes it's better to refer to it that way
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:39.920]  than to say the product because that sounds
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:41.240]  a little bit like you're selling something
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:44.560]  but the fact is, my editors were frustrated
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:45.840]  by the fact that all they could really do
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:48.720]  was put text in the CMS and why can't we do this
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:49.680]  and why can't we do that?
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:51.280]  And the answer was, well, we could do that
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.440]  if we worked with the product group
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:55.120]  but you got to speak their language
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.080]  and that is a challenge.
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:59.040]  So I appreciate when Rosen sort of waves his hands
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:00.520]  and is like, hey, pay attention.
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:03.160]  This is really important because a lot of people
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:06.160]  in journalism don't want to hear that.
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:08.760]  They want to just work and it's a natural response, right?
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:10.280]  To be like, no, no, no, I'm just gonna do my thing
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:11.360]  that I'm comfortable with
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:14.440]  but I think it leads to bad places.
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:17.480]  I think it's a danger, it's dangerous to use
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:22.480]  the word religion but I do feel like in a casual way.
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:27.720]  The belief that if you're a journalist
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:31.440]  that you should almost like obligated
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.840]  in a moral sense to not pay attention to the business side
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:38.200]  was ingrained in at least a generation,
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.160]  maybe several generations, especially,
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:43.960]  I don't know if it's especially US centric or not
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:46.680]  but it certainly seems so in the newspaper industry
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:49.800]  that it was just almost religious
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:53.360]  that it was, and it was only sustainable
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.840]  because newspapers were, you know, like you said,
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:58.520]  they had a monopoly and they were incredibly profitable.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:00.040]  It's a licensed print money.
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:00.880]  Right.
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:02.840]  I remember when I was at the Enquirer,
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:05.680]  there was a time where they had,
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:08.680]  and this is in the late 90s where they had buyouts
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:12.680]  because they had a quarter where their profit margin
[1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:17.680]  was 19%. They were, the Enquirer was a night ritter paper
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:24.720]  and they were so, the 20% was like red line in the sand.
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:27.960]  We're like, I guess you can't ever, a line in the sand.
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:33.640]  And they dipped to 19 and they were like instantly
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.200]  went into red alert and sirens went off
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:39.640]  and they bought people out and it was crazy.
[1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:42.400]  I don't know if you guys have this, I think it's an East Coast
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:43.680]  thing called Metro.
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:47.080]  It's a free daily newspaper.
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:48.640]  I don't even know if they're still around here in Philly,
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:53.640]  but they were a free daily and they set up most of their kiosks
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:58.480]  at commuter entrances, subway entrances, bus stops.
[1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:05.200]  Not real thick, but it was definitely a competitor
[1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:07.760]  to the Enquirer and the Daily News.
[1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:11.160]  And because if you could read the Metro for free
[1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:13.560]  and finish it before you got where you were going,
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:15.800]  you had no reason to buy the Enquirer Daily News.
[1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:21.880]  And it led to crazy scenarios like the guy who was in charge,
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:24.400]  I, as the graphic design work I did,
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:28.360]  I worked with a lot of the classified advertising people
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:30.720]  and did a lot of the promotional stuff that they needed
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:32.240]  to sell to give to people.
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:35.640]  And so like the guy, he was a great guy for good his name,
[1:06:35.640 --> 1:06:39.360]  but he was in charge of auto advertising, classified,
[1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:40.960]  or all auto advertising,
[1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:44.280]  which was huge, huge, huge business, took the buyout,
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:46.640]  which was like two or three years salary.
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.280]  And a week later he took the job as the automotive ad guy
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:55.560]  at the Metro, like, and it was like they just paid him
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:07:00.560]  three years salary to go and start selling ads at arrival.
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:03.760]  And while they were still incredibly profitable,
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:04.920]  I mean, it was just crazy.
[1:07:04.920 --> 1:07:07.280]  I mean, I've definitely experienced the layoffs
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:09.640]  while we're profitable where the business people are like,
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:10.480]  no, no, we're profitable.
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.920]  We're going to make a profit, we're profitable,
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.000]  and then they lay off 10 people.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.080]  And there is nothing worse than saying,
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.160]  you can't work here anymore because we're not quite
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:19.600]  making enough profit.
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.480]  And that's a disconnect in business.
[1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:24.320]  I mean, there are businesses that are all about
[1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:25.840]  looking for growth and investment,
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:27.120]  and there are businesses that are just trying
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:29.200]  to be sustainable, profitable businesses
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:31.280]  that can employ a bunch of people.
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:34.200]  And that too is part of the disconnect,
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:36.360]  of like not understanding what kind of business you work for
[1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:39.000]  and what their metrics are, and not on a very detailed level
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.800]  of like, what's the bonus structure for the salespeople?
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:44.520]  But to understand like, what are they looking for?
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.920]  And what do they expect from us?
[1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:48.760]  And what's the growth?
[1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:52.520]  And some of that has to come from the top.
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:54.960]  And in my years, I would get a very,
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:57.520]  varying degree of that depending on who the CEO was
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:59.800]  of what do we show the employees?
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:01.960]  And do a varying degree of the employees
[1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:04.320]  wanted to or didn't want to hear it?
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:06.960]  But I think it's just a dangerous situation to be in,
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:09.640]  to not understand what kind of company you're working for
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:10.920]  and what their goals are.
[1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:12.840]  I mean, at night, Ritter, at least, it was clear
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:14.440]  that 20% was the line.
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:17.600]  And if you weren't showing 20% profit margin,
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:19.440]  that was Red Alert Time.
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:20.760]  Boy, those days.
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:25.280]  And I think the danger there is that it seemed very clear,
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:26.600]  like because I wasn't involved,
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:28.000]  I wasn't going to be my career.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.440]  I wasn't ever even full-time.
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:30.760]  I was always like a contractor.
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:34.400]  But I loved the business, and you know, I loved it.
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:37.800]  But my view from the ground floor and just looking
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:39.680]  at the whole thing was that it was so clear to me
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.080]  once I got in and sort of got the gist
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.000]  of how the Philadelphia and choir were ran at the time,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.960]  that the people who were in that building,
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:52.720]  working on that newspaper, were incredible people,
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.800]  absolutely amazing people.
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:57.200]  I forget the exact years.
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:01.800]  But there's a stretch from the mid-80s to mid-90s
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:03.800]  where the Philadelphia and choir were one more Pulitzer
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:07.320]  prizes than any newspaper in the US.
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:08.960]  It was a tremendous, tremendous.
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:11.400]  And eventually all these great talent
[1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:13.960]  that wound up working at the New York Times
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:16.440]  and Washington Post and Newsweek and Time,
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:19.200]  they all took these buyouts and went to these other places.
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.160]  But at the time, it was amazing.
[1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:23.560]  And they were dedicated to the craft
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.720]  and dedicated to the civic duty of a newspaper
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:29.200]  in a big metropolitan city and all this stuff.
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.840]  But it was so clear that Night Ritter
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:35.640]  as a corporate parent didn't give two shits
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:40.640]  if they were selling widgets or newspapers or whatever
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:43.320]  as long as they hit that 20% profit margin
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:44.160]  and had growth.
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:45.240]  It didn't matter what they were doing.
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:49.880]  Had no love or interest in what it meant to actually
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:51.680]  be making a newspaper.
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.480]  And like we were saying,
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:55.480]  when you've got the license to print money,
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:58.000]  you can, it's a little bit easier to be blissfully ignorant.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.440]  But I think, again, somebody could listen to this podcast
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:03.800]  and say, uh-huh, here they are.
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.760]  They're all admitting that journalism is not truly objective.
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:10.200]  It's actually affected by what the business does.
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:12.440]  Well, the truth is, of course it is.
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:15.800]  Unless you are consumer reports or something.
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:18.120]  And even then, you have the objective
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:19.240]  of getting donations.
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:21.400]  And if you don't get them, you can't stay in business.
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.920]  There is always a fundamental precept
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:27.120]  of a media business about what they're doing
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.320]  and why they're doing it.
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:31.400]  And like a sports writer at the Philadelphia
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:34.720]  inquirer who is from San Francisco can't say,
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:37.880]  you know, I've decided I'm going to write about the giants, right?
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.400]  It's like, no, no, we're in the business
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:40.640]  of covering Philadelphia.
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:43.080]  And I got that when I went to Mac user, they told me,
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:44.800]  like Apple's big in education,
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:46.320]  but we're not targeting education.
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:48.160]  It's like, that was the target market.
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:50.800]  The art target market market market wasn't the Mac.
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.840]  And it was the business market, primarily.
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:57.280]  And then, secondarily, other users using it at home,
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:58.280]  but not education.
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:10:59.120]  And why was that?
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:00.400]  Because they didn't spend a lot of money.
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:03.360]  And those advertisers didn't want to reach them
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:04.320]  because of that.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.000]  And yeah, that was focusing what we could write about.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.440]  But that's just a fundamental business constraint.
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:14.800]  What the objectivity comes on the inside of those constraints.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.680]  Like, this is what this publication is.
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:18.600]  This is what this website is, whatever it is.
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:20.760]  And then, within there, I need to be free
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:22.160]  to make the decisions about the best way
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:23.080]  to serve that audience.
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:24.560]  But how do you choose the audience?
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:26.800]  In a large part, in most of these businesses,
[1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:29.200]  is you're choosing an audience who can make money,
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.200]  selling ads too.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:31.720]  And that's OK.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:34.040]  But that is a fundamental thing.
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:37.280]  I mean, journalistic freedom only goes so far.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:39.480]  There is a fundamental precept of your business
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:42.120]  that you do need to follow, as much as that guy might
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.640]  like to write about, if not the giants,
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:47.800]  write about darts or Canadian football or whatever.
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:49.520]  It's like, that's not what you're here to do.
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:52.680]  That's not who we serve with the Philadelphia Enquirer.
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:54.360]  All right.
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:59.440]  Yeah, and you have to be able to, even in our lean, mean,
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:02.120]  one person type operations like six colors
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:06.000]  or daring fireball, you still have to be able to do it
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.040]  in a way that makes sense financially.
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:09.960]  And the thing that makes me think about that.
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:14.880]  So in a whole 10, 15 years, you could very, very feasible
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:20.440]  to just run a web log out of your pocket.
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.600]  I forget what I pay per month for daring fireball,
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:24.560]  but if I really wanted to go for it, if I just
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:26.880]  wanted to do it without any sponsorships or ads
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:30.040]  or any revenue at all, even with the readership I have it,
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:32.480]  I think it would be like $100 a month, maybe.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:34.200]  Maybe I could probably find a way to get lower.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:36.920]  You could do it, but you could certainly do it for $50.
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:39.440]  I'm paying $50, and I'm running the incomparable and six
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.040]  colors on the same server for $50 a month.
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:43.760]  It's not a problem.
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.680]  But the reason that podcasting has exploded recently
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:50.240]  is that until recently, it was financially unfeasible.
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:53.520]  There was no way, it doesn't seem like that long ago
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:56.120]  when I started during fireball, but there's just no way
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:59.680]  financially that in 2002, 2003, 2004,
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.960]  that I could distribute $100 megabyte MP3 files
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:07.880]  to thousands of people it would have cost thousands
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:09.120]  and thousands of dollars a month.
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.280]  Even a couple years ago, I think that would have been the case.
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:15.240]  No, the rise in podcasting correlates
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:21.560]  exactly to when it became financially pretty cheap.
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:22.560]  Yeah, through order.
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:24.440]  Order on Twitter, Libson, or Squarespace,
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:28.600]  or through a hosting company that gives you a terabyte of data
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:30.760]  for $50 a month, that sort of thing.
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:34.000]  Right, but until recently, there was no such thing.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.600]  The bandwidth limits were in the low gigabytes
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:41.640]  or even the hundreds of megabytes.
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:45.640]  And so if your files or typical podcast for this show
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:47.200]  is somewhere around the 100 megabytes,
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:48.960]  sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more,
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:50.160]  depending on how long it is.
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:56.120]  But every 100 people, that's 100, or that's a gigabyte, right?
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:58.040]  Yeah, or 10 people.
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:13:59.840]  I don't know, that's a super really fast.
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:02.360]  So I did the math when we were pulling the incomparable off
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:04.560]  of five by five, and I was trying to figure out
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:06.320]  whether we would host that on our own server,
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:08.320]  or whether we wanted to use a CDN for it.
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:11.280]  And I did the math, and I was like, wow, that's a lot of data.
[1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:14.440]  Just on a regular episode of a moderately popular podcast,
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:18.200]  it's a just in five years ago terms,
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.160]  an impossible amount of data.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.760]  And it's cost aside, it wasn't even something
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:26.520]  people would tolerate when they were connecting
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:27.880]  with very slow connections.
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:29.640]  They might think, I'd like to listen to that,
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:31.480]  but Jesus, it's going to take all night to download it on.
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.200]  No, yeah, but yeah, I remember those days
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:36.760]  of like, leave the Mac on downloading podcasts in iTunes,
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:38.240]  because it's going to take forever.
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  Right, but you really need to understand stuff like that.
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:43.120]  You need to know that if you're going to do video,
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:44.960]  you're probably going to have to host it YouTube,
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.640]  or something like that, just because that way
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.320]  you don't have to pay the bill.
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:50.800]  Yeah, and you better know what the terms are for YouTube,
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:53.480]  then, you know, are you going to use YouTube's ads,
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:55.720]  and what percentage do you get, and is that going to,
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:57.960]  you know, then how many people do you need to get viewing
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:00.800]  each video for you to be able to make a living doing that?
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.720]  Right, yeah, you know, it's not too complicated,
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:07.160]  but you've got to, there's all these abstractions
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:09.240]  where you can just pretend that these things don't exist,
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:12.200]  and you don't have to worry about them, it doesn't work like that.
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:13.800]  Right.
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.320]  Let me take a break, good time to take a break,
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:18.240]  and thank another long time friend of the show
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.320]  are good friends at Squarespace.
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:22.320]  You guys know Squarespace.
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:25.440]  Squarespace is the all-in-one website
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:29.440]  building hosting slash design tool.
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.480]  You go to Squarespace, you sign up for an account,
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:34.560]  and you can create your own website.
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:35.400]  What type of website?
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:38.080]  Something like a blog, or do you want to host a podcast?
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:40.440]  Squarespace can handle the audio too.
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:41.800]  That's another cost-effective way.
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:42.800]  Yes, absolutely.
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:46.560]  You can do a blog, you can do a podcast at Squarespace.
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:48.640]  But what if you have a totally different idea in mind?
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:50.280]  Something that's more like an online store
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.400]  where you want to sell stuff?
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:52.200]  Well, guess what?
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:54.440]  Squarespace can do that.
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:57.120]  Portfolio, maybe you're a designer or a photographer,
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.400]  something like that, and you want to create an online portfolio
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:01.040]  of your work.
[1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:02.520]  Well, Squarespace can do that.
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:06.200]  Just about any kind of thing you could need
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.000]  to build a website for, Squarespace
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.280]  has those sort of components right there
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:15.760]  ready for you to drag and drop into your own custom design.
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.280]  They have templates to choose from,
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:18.960]  to start with, beautiful templates,
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.440]  and that they scale right from your phone
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:29.000]  to tablet to 27-inch 5K retina iMac, and they
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.200]  have the brand-new Squarespace 7.
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:34.680]  This is the latest version of Squarespace.
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:36.400]  Totally redesigned.
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.440]  Everything is right there.
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:41.600]  You don't really have to, if you're logged into your account,
[1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.480]  instead of a separate editing mode
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:47.560]  when you want to change stuff, you just do it right there.
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:50.760]  It is sort of the original vision for hypertext
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:54.080]  where the big complaint against the worldwide web
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:58.920]  when it came out in 1993, 1994 was that editing was something
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:01.680]  you did in a text editor through FTP,
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:05.440]  and you had to know HTML, and browsing was something
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:06.360]  you did in the browser.
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:08.120]  Why can't you add it right there in the browser?
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:09.680]  Well, that's what Squarespace 7 does.
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:11.080]  You just look at what you're looking at.
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:14.400]  It's WhizzyWake, and you drag what you want to drag.
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:15.760]  You take out what you want to take out.
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:18.960]  You add what you want to add right there in place.
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:21.600]  They've added integration with Google Apps.
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:24.280]  They have a new partnership with Getty Images.
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:28.040]  So if you want to get stock photography, stock imagery,
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:31.440]  you could do it right there through the Squarespace partnership
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:33.520]  with Getty Images.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:37.240]  15 of their templates are all brand new, specifically,
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:41.880]  for Squarespace 7, and all of them are super beautiful.
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:45.000]  The other thing you get with Squarespace, definitely worth
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.200]  mentioning every time they sponsor the show,
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:52.000]  is award-winning 24-hour, seven-day-week tech support
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.720]  via live chat and email.
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:58.080]  They have Teams tech support teams all around the globe, which
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:17:59.720]  is how they keep it going 24-7.
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.480]  So no matter what time you're working on it,
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.040]  whether you're working on it late at night,
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:05.800]  middle of the night, early in the morning,
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.720]  Squarespace has tech support ready to help
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:11.360]  answer any of your questions.
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:13.160]  So where do you go to get started?

[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:37.600]  the offer code, which you use later on.
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:39.400]  Go sign up through that URL.
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:41.520]  Then a month later, when your free trial's up,
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:46.160]  use this code JG, and you'll get 10% off your first purchase
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:48.240]  and support the show.
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:49.800]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:52.440]  So what else is going on?
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:53.080]  I don't know.
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:55.040]  I mean, the funny thing about this time of year
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:59.640]  is it's pretty quiet, and you're talking about going out
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:00.280]  on my own.
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.720]  We used to have a whole staff who would come up with ideas
[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:06.440]  of stuff you could write that you could put in the system
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:09.400]  and just have it play out over the last two weeks of the year
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:10.480]  when nothing was going on.
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:12.080]  And doing this myself, I'm like, oh, yeah,
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.240]  I should probably put something.
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:14.560]  I should probably write something today,
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:15.880]  because there's nothing going on.
[1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:17.840]  But it's difficult, because there's really,
[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:19.120]  there's nothing going on.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:21.000]  So you end up writing lots of, hey,
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.360]  let's look back at 2014, and what do we learn?
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:25.720]  And what are my favorite things?
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:26.840]  And I don't know.
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:29.400]  It's a tough time of year, because there
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:32.560]  isn't a lot of tech stuff going on.
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:33.560]  I've used it in the past.
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:34.720]  This year, I'd just been busy.
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.840]  It's just been a crazy, busy holiday thing
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:39.120]  with family and travel and stuff, but a lot of times,
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:43.960]  I use this the low period to write something
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:45.720]  that it might take a long time.
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:50.600]  And therefore, if I have a big thought piece on where
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:52.680]  I, what we know about the Apple Watch
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:57.440]  now, two or three months later, I wish I had more time for it.
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:59.800]  And maybe in this coming week, I will, but I have idea.
[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:01.440]  But something like that, where it's not
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:04.400]  has nothing to do with what's new or news,
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:06.120]  but just take advantage of the fact
[1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:09.840]  that there isn't any news to really focus on and write
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:10.760]  it something like that.
[1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:11.240]  Right.
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.200]  Yeah, that's one of the things that I've
[1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:15.760]  been grappling with in doing the site
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:20.880]  is how do you balance writing being a one-person operation.
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:23.360]  If you're busy writing a deep-think piece
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:26.160]  about something that's going to go on for 1,000 words,
[1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.280]  you're not writing things to post on the site today.
[1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:31.200]  And I feel like with a less established site like mine,
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:34.320]  I definitely feel pressure to keep the lights on every day
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:36.600]  and try to balance those things.
[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:39.840]  And you have a different pace.
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:41.680]  You can post some links, and then you
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.720]  put out a bigger piece every so often.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:47.880]  And I like your pace, but I don't feel like I can do that
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:48.400]  right now.
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:50.760]  I feel like I need to keep the heartbeat
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:51.920]  a little stronger, because I'm
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:56.360]  trying to establish myself and pick up an audience
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:59.360]  that I may not have captured yet.
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:00.600]  But then I end up in this situation
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:02.120]  where it's like, wow, it's going to take me three days
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:02.400]  to write.
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:06.160]  Like the review of the Retina IMAC was an example where
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:08.200]  it took me two or three days to write that.
[1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:11.960]  And one of my challenges was always,
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:13.600]  should I keep writing this now or should I
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:15.960]  stop and find something short to write and post to the site
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:18.600]  just to let people know I'm still alive,
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.560]  while I'm also writing this longer piece
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:23.600]  and trying to find that balance is tricky.
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:26.400]  It's one of the, again, not being on a team anymore
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:29.680]  and being just myself, I've learned the powerful lesson
[1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:33.400]  of how little one person is capable of producing
[1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:35.440]  versus a staff.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:37.680]  Then everyone's in a while, though, I surprised myself.
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:39.960]  And on my colleague, Crap, I got a lot done in the last.
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:42.240]  I a lot published in the last 24 hours.
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:45.280]  Not just stuff that I'd been working on for a long time
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:47.920]  and happened to finish, I would just be like, wow,
[1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:51.720]  I got like eight links and a full article all done.
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:53.360]  And I'll just say, why can't I do this every day?
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:56.000]  Well, I think part of it is energy.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.800]  And part of it is that that stuff doesn't always
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:21:59.800]  happen like that, right?
[1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:00.520]  I mean, there are days.
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.080]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:05.080]  And maybe I didn't recognize them as much before as I do now.
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:06.880]  But there are those days where it's like, oh my god,
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.440]  there's like five great links.
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:11.080]  And there's like three articles I could write about things
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:12.080]  that happened today.
[1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:13.360]  And those are wonderful days.
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:16.760]  And maybe you defer a couple of those articles later in the week.
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:18.360]  And you just keep on writing about it.
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:20.360]  And then there are other times when it's just like, wow,
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:22.480]  what is happening?
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:23.480]  Nothing is happening.
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:27.800]  And CES is going to happen next week, I think.
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:29.000]  Yeah, January 5th.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.840]  And there's always something interesting to write about there,
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:32.720]  even if it's sort of the anti-CES.
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:36.960]  I'm very happy to not be going to CES this year.
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:40.400]  But so the news cycle will spin up again.
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:42.040]  But you're right, it is kind of nice
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:45.360]  to have that ability to either spend time with family
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:47.920]  or reflect a little bit or work on a longer-term project.
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:49.600]  And I've been thinking about that, too.
[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:52.240]  But with travel, it becomes a lot harder
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:57.040]  to find the time to do that stuff when you're traveling
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:59.360]  or with family and all that.
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:03.400]  Do you have the, I don't know if you've ever,
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:05.160]  I happen to know that six colors
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:06.400]  is running on movable type.
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:08.360]  Yes.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:10.440]  I've been reading them right a post about that at some point,
[1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.680]  just like kind of come out of the closet and be like, yes.
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:16.960]  It might be the last news major site
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:18.760]  to launch on movable type.
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:19.600]  It's possible.
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:21.120]  I heard from the people who were doing the current version
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:23.360]  of movable type, because I'm using movable type four,
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.120]  which I think maybe you were using.
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:27.160]  Yes, definitely.
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:30.000]  The last, I mean, the joke would be the last good version.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  That's what a lot of it.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.440]  Because five was not so good.
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:35.240]  I heard from the people who are the current support license
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:36.200]  people for movable type.
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.920]  And they're like, you know, we want to talk.
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:39.200]  Maybe we can give you a license.
[1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:41.720]  If you, you know, we can use you as an example on,
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:43.840]  and on one level, I was like, oh, that's interesting.
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:45.920]  But then I also was kind of thinking, I'm not sure they
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:48.360]  added anything that I would actually want.
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:51.000]  And I'm fortunate to have my friend Greg Noss
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.960]  is like a Savant with Pearl for one and movable type for two.
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:59.040]  And so in a way, I've got an off the shelf, you know,
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:01.560]  CMS from five years ago or eight years ago
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:04.200]  and a guy who can customize it to do whatever.
[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:05.560]  And so that's pretty good.
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:06.640]  And I threw out all their templates.
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:07.720]  I didn't use any of their templates
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:08.800]  when I built the site templates.
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:11.440]  It's all original templates.
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:14.640]  But, you know, sometimes it's just go with what you know.
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:18.120]  And all the movable type is old and weird.
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:21.080]  I also know it like I could have done WordPress,
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:22.640]  but I actually don't know WordPress.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:25.800]  I would have to learn a lot about WordPress or Squarespace
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:27.040]  or anything that I was doing.
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:28.720]  And I thought I've already got the server here.
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:31.440]  It's already running movable type for some other projects.
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:33.440]  Why not just do that?
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:36.400]  I can do that without learning anything about the CMS.
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:37.680]  And I can just focus on the content
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:39.360]  and getting the templates live.
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:41.280]  And when I was launching a site in a week,
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:42.560]  that seemed like a good idea.
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:44.400]  So, you know, it's fine.
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.120]  Do you have the IM-IMT plugin
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:52.240]  that lets you give you like a posting interface from the iPhone?
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:53.320]  Oh, I don't think I do.
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:56.520]  See, that to me is the game changer.
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:58.120]  And I don't know.
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:00.560]  And I know that WordPress has like a pretty good,
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:04.000]  maybe even better iPhone-optimized interface.
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:08.280]  I'm gonna, I forget who else wrote IMT.
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:12.960]  I know Brad Choate, who is a long time,
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:15.960]  six apart in play, wrote the plugin originally.
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:17.840]  It goes back to like 2008.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:19.560]  I mean, it came out, maybe even 2007.
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:21.240]  It came out very early.
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:24.600]  It, you know, it doesn't give you all of movable type.
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:27.920]  It only gives you, it just pick a blog,
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:32.000]  either make a new entry or edit an existing entry.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  And then when you open an entry,
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.240]  it's just, you know, here's the field that you show it.
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:38.440]  So I hacked mine a little bit,
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:40.760]  just to make it a little bit more specific
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:42.000]  to how I use the fields.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.320]  But, yeah, well, that's what I did with,
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:49.520]  like Greg wrote a plugin that does audio processing
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:52.520]  because doing podcasts and movable type is problematic
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.800]  because movable type doesn't know like
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:55.880]  what the byte count is.
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:57.400]  And you're supposed to put that in the RSS feed,
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.040]  the length and the byte count of the file
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:00.120]  you're linking to.
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  And so he just wrote a plugin for me that does that.
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:05.240]  And that means I can keep using it.
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:08.320]  It is a little bit like, you know, an IT person saying,
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:10.000]  I know that there have been five versions
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.440]  of Adobe Photoshop that have come out,
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:14.920]  but we're just gonna stay on version three
[1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:17.840]  because it works for us and we're okay, right?
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:20.400]  And it's a little like that being on this old CMS.
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:21.320]  But it works fine.
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:23.480]  And at the point that it doesn't work fine,
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:25.520]  it's got a perfectly reasonable database format
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:27.000]  and I can migrate it somewhere else.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.800]  But, you know, like I said,
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:31.000]  knowing somebody who can write a movable type plugin
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  in a few hours to solve a problem helps a lot.
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.520]  I could do anything with six colors though.
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:39.360]  It's so simple.
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:40.840]  The incomparable is much crazier.
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:41.680]  It's immovable type,
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:42.960]  but it's got like multiple blogs
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.240]  and they're all related to each other.
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:45.080]  So it's like a relationship.
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:45.920]  Well, that's right.
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:46.760]  Yeah, right.
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.840]  The incomparable is no longer one thing.
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:50.720]  Right, right, because it's multiple podcasts.
[1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:54.320]  So we've got a podcast blog and an episodes blog
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:56.560]  and they interrelate and that's how you can generate
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:59.920]  multiple podcast feeds and a master list
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:01.440]  and a master feed and all of that
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:03.840]  is actually a bunch of movable type things.
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:05.600]  That's a totally crazy thing.
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:10.240]  But it works and we built it because there was just things
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:13.720]  that the Dan Benjamin's CMS didn't offer
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.800]  and they were not things Dan should ever have built
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:19.640]  because his other shows would never use them.
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:21.120]  But for like, I want an index
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:22.680]  so that people can find out
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:24.400]  that we talked about Raiders of the Lost Ark
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:26.280]  in like episode eight or something
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:27.680]  and they can go to a page
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:30.000]  and scroll down to Raiders of the Lost Ark
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.200]  and there's a link to the podcast where we talked about it
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:34.880]  and Dan's site was never gonna do that
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:35.800]  and that's not his fault.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:37.360]  It's just, it didn't make sense for him
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:38.600]  but I wanted those features.
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.000]  So we built this crazy thing and movable type
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.280]  and it's crazy but it works pretty well.
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:46.960]  And once I had that up and running,
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.280]  it was really easy to just add the six colors blog
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:52.760]  on to movable type too
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:55.600]  because I was already wrangling it and Greg already knew it
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:57.160]  and so we decided to do that too.
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:58.840]  The nice thing about movable type is,
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:00.400]  it's template language is fairly simple
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:01.600]  but it's pretty robust
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:06.280]  and it's rendering static pages
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.360]  which means you're not gonna get fireballs
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:10.040]  which is nice too.
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:12.240]  Well, everybody renders static pages.
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:14.480]  It's just a question of whether they're rendering them
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:18.440]  immediately or whether they're calling it caching.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:19.320]  Well, that's true, that's true
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.120]  and caching with WordPress has gotten a lot better
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:24.160]  which is good and I've used WordPress,
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:27.560]  it's just I'm not comfortable with it.
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.960]  It's interesting to see stuff like this
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:33.840]  is in some cases is a nerd litmus test a little bit, right?
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:35.840]  It's like, oh, what blog platform do you use
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:38.360]  and there's some movable type is not cool.
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.200]  It's old and weird but right tool for the job,
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:46.040]  right tool for the job and I'm a big believer in that
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:48.000]  that I shouldn't have to spend a week
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.400]  getting up to speed in a platform
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:51.400]  that's gonna let me do exactly what I was gonna do
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:53.800]  on the thing that I already know.
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:54.880]  And if I had to jump, I would.
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:57.200]  In fact, when I'm thinking about doing like
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.440]  site registrations or something for the website,
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:04.440]  that one option I have to do like a membership
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.800]  of voluntary membership for six colors,
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:11.000]  there's a WordPress plugin that does a good job with that.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.080]  I think that's what Ben Thompson's using.
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:15.400]  It might be and it's what Sean Blanc is using.
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.880]  Or if not, he's customized.
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.320]  Yeah, but Sean Blanc, I know, told me about it
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:21.920]  and if I wanna use that tool,
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:24.800]  I can just set up a WordPress instance too
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:27.440]  and use that for that and not for the rest of it
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:29.200]  and just have them interconnect.
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:30.280]  And I can do that too.
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:35.360]  It's not necessarily bad to do stuff like that,
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:37.480]  but it doesn't make me feel not cool when I get,
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:39.440]  I got an email the other day from somebody who was like,
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:41.720]  I see this feature on your blog
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:43.400]  and I would like to implement that.
[1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:45.160]  I assume you use WordPress like I do.
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:46.000]  How did you do it?
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.520]  I'm like, oh, okay, bad news.
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:49.880]  Not using WordPress.
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:53.360]  Yeah, I've gotten that over the years too with the combined post
[1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:56.000]  thing, although you can definitely do it in WordPress,
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.680]  but you would have to do it in a different way.
[1:29:57.680 --> 1:29:58.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:01.960]  And again, I don't know how you do it in WordPress,
[1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:03.800]  but I know exactly how you do it in movable type.
[1:30:03.800 --> 1:30:08.240]  So, especially for just wanting to get it up soon,
[1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:10.280]  it made a lot of sense to do that.
[1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:12.680]  You know, I kinda like movable type.
[1:30:12.680 --> 1:30:16.160]  It's funky and weird, but I had an argument with somebody
[1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:18.400]  where they were talking about what real Markdown was.
[1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:19.360]  I mean, don't get me started.
[1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:20.320]  Don't get you started.
[1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.680]  But I had a moment where I said, you know,
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:26.200]  I still consider Markdown.pl, the definitive Markdown,
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:29.160]  and they very, I think, thought they're being very smart.
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:31.000]  They said, yeah, but you don't actually,
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:32.240]  you know, how much of what you do
[1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:34.600]  actually gets processed by Markdown.pl.
[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.640]  And I said, all of it, because either I run it
[1:30:37.640 --> 1:30:40.040]  in a script in BB at it and it outputs HTML
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:41.280]  and I paste that in somewhere,
[1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:43.520]  or I'm using movable type,
[1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:45.880]  which is using the Markdown.pl on the fly
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:47.240]  to convert those to HTML.
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:50.440]  So I'm, you know, it has that advantage too.
[1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:54.880]  Even my, the Markdown dingus at Daring Fireball,
[1:30:54.880 --> 1:30:58.320]  which is an extremely popular thing.
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:01.640]  I mean, thousands of, the number of people
[1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:04.600]  who use that webpage every day is greater
[1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:07.040]  than I think the daily readership of Daring Fireball
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:08.640]  when I went full-time.
[1:31:08.640 --> 1:31:10.960]  It's that popular.
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:13.960]  It's just a little PHP form where you can enter some markdown,
[1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.480]  hit a button and it gives you the output beneath,
[1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:18.360]  which you can then copy and paste elsewhere.
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.720]  Which I originally wrote just for people.
[1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:24.920]  I didn't think people would actually use it as a tool tool.
[1:31:24.920 --> 1:31:27.120]  I thought it was just like, if you're learning this,
[1:31:27.120 --> 1:31:29.320]  if you're reading about this and you want to learn,
[1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:32.360]  type something here and then you can see the output here
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:35.200]  and there's no better way to learn than, you know,
[1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.840]  you can see that you put asterisks around the word
[1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:40.920]  and then in the output it puts m tags around the word.
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:44.360]  But people use it on a daily basis just like,
[1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:45.520]  oh, I want to convert.
[1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:47.720]  I need to get some, I need to have this in HTML.
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:49.800]  I'll quick dash it out here, hit the button
[1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:51.320]  and copy and paste it and I have.
[1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:52.240]  So anyway, that's great.
[1:31:52.240 --> 1:31:54.680]  But it's a little form written in PHP,
[1:31:54.680 --> 1:31:57.560]  but behind the scenes it still calls out to the Perl word.
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:02.960]  And it sounds, when I did that, I thought,
[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.600]  well, that's never gonna scale.
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.360]  Like if this page gets popular, it's gotta be slow,
[1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:08.200]  but it's not.
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:10.440]  Because the whole thing is so stupid simple
[1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:13.520]  that even if it's a PHP script that calls out
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:16.160]  to the Unix shell and runs a Perl script on the text file
[1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:17.560]  and then puts the input back in it,
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:19.800]  it all takes place in a fraction of a second.
[1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:22.360]  You're waiting longer for the network
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:25.200]  than you are for my server to do that.
[1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.520]  It's amazing how far we've come.
[1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:30.480]  Yeah, because I remember when running a Perl script
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:33.640]  was actually like, you know, stop the presses slow.
[1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:36.760]  Right, it was like, should I write this in C
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:39.160]  or should I just write like a Perl script?
[1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.240]  And it's like, wow, it'll take a second or two
[1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:42.280]  for Perl to fire up.
[1:32:42.280 --> 1:32:45.520]  But you know what, I don't, it's so much easier
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:46.360]  to do it.
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:49.720]  I wanna take a break and this is even a sponsor break.
[1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:51.560]  I wanna circle back half an hour.
[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.680]  I've, the research department,
[1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:56.840]  the award winning research department here at the talk show
[1:32:56.840 --> 1:33:01.040]  has found the white paper that I was talking about.
[1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:03.080]  It's by Wilfredo Sanchez.
[1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:04.920]  I can't believe I forgot Fred's name
[1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:09.840]  because I've even had drinks with him at WWDC.
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:14.840]  Great guy, it's a USNEX 2000 presentation.
[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:17.120]  So this is from the year 2000.
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:19.560]  The challenges of integrating the Unix
[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:21.880]  and macOS environments.
[1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:23.600]  And I will put it in the show notes guaranteed.
[1:33:23.600 --> 1:33:26.680]  It is, I swear it sounds very dry,
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:29.640]  but it is a terrific read if you have any
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:32.800]  technical interest in this sort of thing like,
[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:34.480]  well, how do you square the circle
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:37.920]  of having a classic macOS with colon separators
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:40.440]  and Unix with slash separators?
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:42.080]  And other issues too, like the fact
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.800]  that the Unix file system didn't have file IDs
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:47.640]  and the Mac had aliases and didn't have sim links
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:50.640]  and Unix didn't have aliases and did have sim links
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:51.560]  and et cetera, et cetera.
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.000]  How did they make it all work?
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.240]  It is a wonderfully, well, you know,
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:57.880]  it's typical just for someone who would be
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:59.040]  a great engineer at Apple.
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:02.560]  It is, it's written in very, very clear language.
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:04.240]  So I will put it in the show notes.
[1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:06.160]  I don't wanna forget that.
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:07.000]  That's right.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.960]  My apologies to anybody out there who's listening,
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:15.240]  who remembered that Fred Sanchez wrote that paper.
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.240]  And for the last 45 minutes has been writing email
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:20.840]  while they listen to us continue on the show.
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:22.600]  Isn't that great when you get the Twitter feedback?
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.720]  It's like, oh, you can't, the answer is this
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:26.600]  and you're like, just keep listening.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:27.440]  We got it.
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:30.040]  So my apologies to that.
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:32.000]  I know where you are in the show right now.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:33.200]  Your patience will be rewarded.
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.920]  Just keep on listening.
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:39.160]  You had another, oh, you know what,
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:42.560]  let's talk about the interview Sony thing.
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:45.200]  Oh yeah, that is something that was going on
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:47.200]  over Christmas.
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:48.040]  Right.
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:53.040]  This whole thing where Sony Entertainment got hacked
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:57.120]  by somebody, many people including the US government
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:34:59.800]  believe either by the North Korean government
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:02.440]  or by a group sponsored by the North Korean government.
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:03.280]  Right.
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:09.320]  Perhaps in protest of this movie, Seth Rogen,
[1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:13.000]  James Franco or as president Obama called him,
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  James Flackup.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.760]  James Flackup, yeah.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:16.920]  Well, I mean, what's the story?
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.400]  It was conflating him with the Ravens quarter, right?
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:20.240]  Yeah, Joey Flackup.
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:21.560]  Right, Joey Flackup.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:27.080]  You know, a movie that is about a comedy
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  about them assassinating North Korean leader, Kim Jung,
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:37.080]  right, they're asked by the CIA to assassinate him.
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:43.000]  And then they got hacked and all this embarrassing stuff
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.040]  came out and then they got threatened.
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:48.960]  They were threats, whether they were real or imagined
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:50.520]  that any theater, it was supposed to come out
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:51.880]  on Christmas Day, I guess, and any,
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:54.000]  there were threats that any theater that showed it
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.920]  was going to perhaps suffer some kind of terrorist attack.
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:59.840]  Yeah, I think they said there would be another 9-11
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.680]  at another 9-11.
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:02.520]  All the theaters near you, yeah.
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:05.440]  All right, which doesn't seem like, seems a lot to know.
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:07.880]  Yeah, you're going to fly how many airplanes
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:08.720]  into the movie theaters.
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:13.720]  But anyway, theaters decided, I think, I think it was a mistake,
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:19.200]  but I think they made a simple economic decision,
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.080]  which was, well, Christmas is a huge time for movies
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:24.000]  and period, this movie in particular
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.920]  wasn't going to be a big hit anyway.
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:29.000]  Just screw this movie and keep the theaters open.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.200]  And then next thing, Sony wanted to release it online.
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:37.760]  And they did, but iTunes was not among the streaming outfits
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:39.320]  that had it on this one day.
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:41.320]  On this one day.
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:46.400]  As we record, we were recording on the 29th,
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:48.440]  it hit iTunes yesterday, the 28th.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:53.080]  I think that summarizes the situation.
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:55.120]  Yeah, and there was one weird story
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:00.400]  that suggested that Sony had called the White House
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:05.320]  asking for help in getting Apple to put it on iTunes,
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:08.000]  which I have not seen any corroboration of that,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.640]  but that was the one that struck me as like,
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:10.800]  that's weird, that's weird.
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.560]  Yeah, that was the New York Times, and it was an off.
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:16.640]  It was just like in the middle of the article,
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:18.200]  and it was just sort of offhand.
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:19.160]  I mean, I don't know if that's your call
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:21.000]  the switchboard and yes, we're at a Q's number,
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.640]  or is that like President Obama,
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:24.920]  can you do us a solid and call Tim Cook?
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:28.040]  There's a spectrum of what might have happened there.
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:29.160]  And it's unclear from that.
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:30.000]  There's sort of the implication
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.520]  that they wanted it to be in iTunes exclusive,
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:36.120]  and Apple wasn't interested,
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:39.400]  and then what ended up happening is that it went up
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:43.600]  on Christmas Eve, on Google Play,
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:48.600]  and on YouTube for purchase or rental,
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.520]  and Xbox, through Xbox Live.
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:53.840]  Correct.
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:57.160]  And not iTunes until the 28th, I guess.
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.000]  Right.
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:01.440]  You know, I wrote today,
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.920]  I just before we started the show,
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:09.920]  I gave it my headline of the week award of the BGR's headline
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:13.000]  was Apple, oh God, I don't want to get this wrong,
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.320]  because it's so classic.
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:19.480]  BGR's headline was Apple finally decides
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:21.600]  to stand up to Sony hackers,
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:24.280]  releases the interview on iTunes.
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:25.120]  Oh man.
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:28.040]  So, you know, whether it's true or not,
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:30.640]  nobody, I've got nobody on the record,
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.920]  but you know, speaking to some people at Apple,
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:34.680]  nobody directly involved at iTunes,
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:36.680]  but people who know people who are involved at iTunes,
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:39.200]  that the story I've heard, and it makes sense,
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:40.680]  because like for example, if you're a developer,
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:41.720]  this is public knowledge,
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:45.800]  iTunes connect closes around like the 22nd or 23rd,
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:47.040]  and they even say,
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:48.400]  you go to the iTunes connect site,
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:51.880]  they say iTunes is connect is closed until December 28th,
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:54.160]  they close a couple of days before Christmas,
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.120]  and they don't open until a couple of days afterwards,
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:00.840]  and that's it, like whatever you want,
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.960]  if you're a developer, if you want to get a bug fix
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:04.840]  and you've got to get it in before they close,
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:06.600]  and otherwise you're going to wait about a week,
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:09.000]  because they want to give people time off.
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:12.000]  So my understanding, I think that what happened
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  was Apple, and the New York Times article
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  kind of hinted at this,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:16.400]  not that Apple wasn't interested,
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:17.960]  but they weren't interested in doing it
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:19.720]  on Sony's timetable.
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:23.680]  That it was, this was like the blackout period for iTunes,
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.840]  and it's not easy, like this stuff is non-trivial,
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:31.280]  like to have all these movies streaming around the world,
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:35.800]  it takes a while for them to propagate around to the CDNs,
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:38.040]  the content delivery networks that Apple uses.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.240]  And again, in theory, if they wanted to get it up on Christmas,
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:44.080]  I'm sure they could have,
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:45.840]  but I think they would have had to call people back
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:49.960]  from vacation and make all sorts of exceptions,
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:51.800]  and I just think Apple's decision was,
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:53.960]  this is not our problem, you know?
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:54.800]  If we have the movie,
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:57.120]  if we get the movie three days from now, so what?
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:58.200]  Yeah, and I think they might have,
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:39:59.680]  then might have said it's not going to be that big a thing.
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:03.440]  I don't know, I look at how this story had gone,
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.040]  and kind of think that somebody at Apple
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:09.160]  probably should have said, let's be prepared
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:12.000]  to slide this thing up on Christmas day,
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.280]  just because that may be how this goes.
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:16.240]  I think it was clear a while ago,
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:17.080]  people were talking about,
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.640]  maybe they would just make an available video on demand.
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:23.600]  And I know that that's, yeah,
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.840]  that's probably telling an employee or two at Apple
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:28.600]  that they need to come to work or be on call
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:30.840]  to come to work over the holiday, and that sucks.
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:33.160]  But at the same time, you know,
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.440]  although that headline is ridiculous, I do feel like
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:37.920]  there was a chance here for Apple
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:41.240]  to just kind of be a part of the story,
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:42.760]  and instead the story was,
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:44.840]  oh, Apple doesn't have it, that's weird.
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.720]  And I don't know, I mean, if they're in the business
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:48.360]  of working with the studios to get this stuff up,
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:51.120]  wouldn't you want to be seen as being on the forefront
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:52.960]  of this and being flexible enough to get it up?
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:55.120]  And I kind of feel like what was revealed
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.640]  is that Apple's systems are a little bit rickety,
[1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:01.000]  and they were running a skeleton crew,
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.240]  and so they just couldn't get it up in time
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.400]  for the timing of it, which is kind of weird,
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:07.320]  although if you've used iTunes Connect,
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:08.960]  it's not unreasonable to think that.
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:11.720]  That's a weird, you know, back-end system
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  that regular people never have to see.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.200]  But it's not a big deal, but it is a little surprising
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:18.520]  that it shouldn't Apple be at the forefront
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  of this stuff and be like, sure,
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:21.600]  we can put that up, no problem.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:22.440]  I don't know.
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:24.200]  I do kind of feel that aside, you know,
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:26.600]  and again, who knows what the actual capabilities are.
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:27.440]  I don't know for sure,
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:29.040]  but I do think that it might be true
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:31.280]  that Apple's back-end system for this stuff
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:34.600]  is less nimble than, you know,
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:36.560]  and no surprise that Google might be
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.720]  a lot more nimble in this regard.
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:39.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:40.520]  That they can do something quicker,
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:43.160]  they can pull something, put it up quicker
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:46.480]  and have it propagate and stream around the world
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:47.640]  quicker than Apple can.
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:49.520]  Or they may, Apple still the company
[1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:51.160]  that when they make changes to the store
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:53.720]  has to take the store down for an hour or two.
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:55.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.520]  Exactly, yeah, I just think that's part of the story.
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:41:58.360]  And they've gotten better,
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.600]  but it also used to be that they would be like TV shows
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:02.840]  that would come out and it was like supposed to be
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:05.600]  released on midnight after the show aired
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:06.440]  or something like that.
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:08.400]  And then on iTunes it would always be
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:11.640]  like sometime the next day or maybe the day after.
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:13.160]  And I never knew whether that meant
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:14.560]  that somebody at the TV studio
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:16.360]  just didn't get the files of them in time
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:19.000]  or whether it was like literally there's a lag
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.040]  in iTunes Connect for content.
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:23.200]  And, you know, the systems are slow
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:26.880]  or the approval is slow and that stuff gets delayed.
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:28.880]  And they seem to be better at that now too,
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:30.720]  but it's possible, I don't know,
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:32.600]  it's also possible that Google and Microsoft
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.560]  and whoever else posted this thing
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:39.320]  had no problem telling their staff to work on Christmas.
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:40.880]  And maybe they had that plan.
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.760]  And Apple has this kind of corporate culture
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:46.520]  of dismissing everybody for that period of time.
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:49.720]  And, you know, maybe that's that I played into this too.
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:51.000]  I don't know.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.400]  And it's not really anybody though, right?
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:53.840]  I mean, it can't really be everybody
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.720]  because, you know, on Christmas morning
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:58.600]  when everybody's launching, you know, new iPods
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:42:59.440]  or iPads.
[1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:00.600]  Somebody's got to be there.
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.040]  There are always people on call.
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:03.680]  So that's the part that just,
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:05.920]  I don't know, maybe they just didn't think it was that big a deal
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:08.960]  and that it was that they didn't need to be there.
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:09.960]  It's just, it's funny.
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:11.680]  In the end, when the president is talking about it
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.600]  in his news conference,
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:14.680]  it's probably a big enough deal to pay attention to it,
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:16.560]  I think, if you're Apple, just to not be,
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:19.560]  even if you're not going to be the exclusive provider of it
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:23.080]  to not be the one major player who's not providing it.
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:24.800]  And I'm not saying they were afraid or anything,
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:27.200]  that it's a lot of stupidity in those statements.
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:29.640]  But I'm just saying, for PR purposes alone,
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:32.480]  don't you want to be not seen as being a step behind
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:34.160]  Microsoft and Google Play?
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:36.400]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:41.480]  And, and though the movie is a silly stupid comedy
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:44.800]  and not like a serious political statement,
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:47.240]  which, you know, would I think if it had been,
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:51.200]  if it had been some kind of like documentary on North Korea
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:55.880]  that had, you know, sparked the hack
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:43:58.440]  and the public need to see this movie.
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:01.360]  Right, that I bet I wouldn't be surprised if Apple
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:03.000]  had made the exception then.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:04.920]  But I feel like it almost doesn't matter.
[1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:07.320]  Like, and I actually did rent the movie.
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:08.160]  Have you rented it?
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.000]  No.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:10.400]  It was really bad.
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:11.720]  Yeah, that's what I've heard, is that, I mean,
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:12.560]  I did not.
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:14.120]  I don't love those guys that they're best,
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:16.560]  but at their worst seems like not a,
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:18.720]  not a best showing for them now.
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:20.720]  There are very few movies that even,
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:22.440]  even though I'm like halfway through and like,
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:24.000]  wow, I regret running this,
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  but I'll stick it through to the end.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.720]  This one I did not make it through,
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:29.440]  like my wife and I just looked each other and say,
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:32.240]  that's just go to bed, no, just go sleep.
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:34.200]  Because otherwise I think I've got to fall asleep down
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:36.440]  here in front of this thing, it was not funny.
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:38.760]  But I still feel like, you know,
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:43.360]  we can't have our movies being held to the whims
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:46.640]  of, you know, anonymous, not job hackers.
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:47.480]  Yeah, oh, yeah, totally.
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:49.240]  Got to stick to your guns.
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:52.680]  And I kind of feel like, so as stupid as the movie itself
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:55.760]  actually is, I kind of feel like it really was
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:00.200]  an exceptional situation that warranted probably exceptional
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:03.040]  and, you know, an exception from Apple
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:04.320]  from what they would typically do.
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:05.320]  Right.
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:08.720]  You know, it wasn't just like Sony had called them up
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:12.160]  and they're like, ah, we had this movie from the summer
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:15.200]  and we've got it scheduled to come up with you guys
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:17.640]  on January 2nd, but you know what?
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:19.640]  It's like, can we do it like a week early
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:21.920]  and maybe get it up on Christmas and Apple's like,
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  no, you guys, you know, before, you know,
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:26.360]  your chance to do that was last week,
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:27.840]  it's coming up on January 2nd.
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:30.640]  This was not just like a regular situation.
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:32.240]  Like you said, the president of the United States
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:33.080]  is talking about it.
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:34.040]  Right. Right.
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:36.000]  I mean, I'm glad that it ended up back in theaters
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.400]  and it sounds like it was the theater chains were like,
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:40.000]  we're afraid, we don't want to scare people away
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.040]  from the other movies, so we're just going to punch it.
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:45.280]  And I'm glad that some theaters finally showed it
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:47.200]  and I'm glad that it was on VOD
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:48.600]  and that people could watch it.
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:51.280]  And yeah, it's a shame in a way that this isn't over
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:55.080]  a more serious, thoughtful piece of work
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:45:58.000]  instead of a kind of stoner road comedy.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.640]  But, you know, I like Franco and Rogan.
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:02.280]  I mean, I like, from all the way back
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:05.000]  in freaks and geeks days, actually.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:08.720]  And the fact that Seth Rogan is a guy who headlines movies
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:11.960]  is totally crazy for me, because, I mean,
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.880]  look at that guy, he's not a movie star
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:15.440]  and yet he is a movie star, I love that.
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:17.600]  And he's a writer who has become, you know,
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:20.080]  he was primarily a writer who has become more of an actor,
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:22.320]  you know, I have lots of positive thoughts about those guys.
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:24.080]  Even if their movie is kind of sucky,
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:26.480]  I'm glad that it got out there.
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.080]  And yeah, yeah, you would think,
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.720]  I don't know, you would think somebody would be like,
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:33.680]  yeah, guys, I think we need to do this.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:36.360]  And I think perhaps that did happen eventually
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:38.480]  after the fact where maybe on Christmas Day,
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:41.520]  somebody was like, why are we not out there with this?
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:43.880]  And so now we see it, you know,
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:46.560]  because it went on iTunes faster than I thought
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:48.840]  once it didn't go on iTunes on the day of release,
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:50.480]  I thought that's going to lag behind
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:52.520]  and they're going to come up and turn all the lights back on
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:54.040]  and then they're going to put it out there
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:57.200]  and it got up there faster than I thought after.
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:00.280]  After they passed by the initial drop date.
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:02.880]  No, it was exactly, I would say it was exactly
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:03.720]  what I expected.
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.440]  I read between the lines and my guess was
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:09.240]  all they said was, we're not going to do this.
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:11.160]  We're not going to get this up by Christmas.
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:12.000]  And that's it.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:13.200]  We'll get it in, you know, somebody will come back
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.920]  in a Friday or Monday and push the button and we'll make it out.
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:17.760]  Yeah.
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:19.680]  Yeah. Stupid movie, cannot.
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:22.760]  We're really not, I really cannot answer that.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:29.760]  An international incident propelled by a stoner road comedy.
[1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:30.880]  It's amazing.
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:32.360]  This is amazing.
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:33.200]  World really.
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:35.280]  All right, let me take a break and thank our third
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:36.800]  and final sponsor of the show.
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:40.280]  And it's a trifecta of long time friends of the show.
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.760]  It's our good friends at Hover.
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:49.200]  Hover, as you may know, is the world's best domain name
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:50.600]  registrar.
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  No junk, no upsell, no scams, no hidden prices, no hidden fees.
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:47:59.000]  You go to Hover, you sign up for an account.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.320]  And you register domains and you get great service.
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:07.520]  You get great technical support, but you get a great
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:10.040]  interface for searching for domains.
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:12.200]  So like if you have like a couple of words,
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:14.960]  you want to use dot com and it's taken.
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:17.240]  They'll help you find other top level domains.
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:20.000]  They'll help you find alternatives based on the words you're
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.080]  looking for really, really, really clever software for getting
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:27.240]  the domain name you want.
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.920]  But the best thing they have, I'm telling you this thing is
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:31.840]  amazing.
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:35.080]  I've done it and it works great.
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.400]  Is the valet transfer service.
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:39.760]  So you sign up for a hover account.
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:42.960]  You've got domains at a bunch of other registrars from around
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:46.680]  the web that you've been registering since like the mid 90s.
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:50.840]  If you give Hover your login credentials to your old
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:55.560]  domain name registrars, they'll take care of moving those
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:57.760]  all your old domains into your hover account.
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.200]  So you'll have them all, all your domains in one centralized
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:05.600]  location with their great interface, their great support,
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:08.560]  just one place to go to renew your domains for the rest of
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.520]  your life.
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:12.360]  Because it's such a hard thing.
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.320]  DNS is so easy to screw up.
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.240]  And when you do screw it up, it takes hours to fix because you
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:20.560]  got to wait for the changes to propagate.
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:23.800]  And how often do regular people mess around with DNS?
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:25.240]  Me almost never.
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:29.240]  I kind of vaguely sort of ish know what it's like.
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:33.920]  The valet transfer people at hover, this is all they do.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.840]  All they do is live, eat, and breathe, DNS, and domain name stuff.
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:39.760]  So they're experts.
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:42.760]  And they know all the ins and outs of all the other registrars and
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:45.320]  all the tricks that they have and stuff like that.
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:47.760]  It's just an amazing, amazing service.
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:48.840]  And you don't pay extra for it.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:52.000]  It's just part of being a hover customer.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.160]  Can you find a cheaper registrar than hover?
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:54.960]  I guarantee it.
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:57.200]  I guarantee you, you can find cheaper ones.
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:00.760]  But hover charges, really fair prices, good prices, and
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:04.240]  it gives you amazing value in return.
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:08.240]  So if you have a new idea that you need a domain name for it, I'm telling
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:10.480]  you, go to hover, you're crazy if you don't.
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:15.160]  If you've got domain names registered at any other registrar who's,
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:20.000]  you're just not satisfied with, sign up for hover and let them move them over.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.240]  And you will not regret it.
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:24.400]  I have never met one person who's like, wow, I regret switching to hover.
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:27.480]  No, it's, it's like the Apple of domain name registrars.
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:28.840]  It's just to cut above the rest.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:32.280]  Here's the coupon code for this episode.
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:34.240]  This, they're on a booze theme for this show.
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:36.720]  So this week's code is bourbon.
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:40.520]  So you sign up, when you sign up for your hover account, use the code bourbon,
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:45.760]  B-O-U-R-B-O-N, and you'll get 10% off your order.
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:48.720]  So sign up for a whole year at a time, you'll save a ton of bucks.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:51.520]  You'll save, you'll get a couple of months for free.
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:54.720]  My thanks to hover, the world's best domain name registrar,
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:57.080]  sign up for your account now.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:00.240]  I have 16 domains of hover.
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:02.040]  I may have a problem, but I do.
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:03.040]  And count.
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:03.400]  Yeah.
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:07.360]  Well, I mean, that's where I put all the, when I got six colors, that's where I put it is.
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:09.920]  Yeah, yeah, I was about to say I'm going to repeat myself, but it couldn't,
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:12.960]  and must have been something I told you in person because you haven't been on the show.
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:16.200]  I think six colors is such a great name.
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:17.800]  Oh, thanks.
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:19.320]  When you came out with that, you didn't ask me.
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:20.880]  You didn't say, hey, John, what you think of the name.
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:23.800]  You didn't, my feelings were a little bit.
[1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:25.280]  I think it was because you knew you had a home run.
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:29.080]  Yeah, well, that was, I mean, I expected a lot more hand ringing and, and, uh,
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:29.880]  difficulty.
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:35.880]  Honestly, I, I, I did some brainstorming when I decided I was going to do this site.
[1:51:35.880 --> 1:51:39.240]  And I thought, I don't want it to be I something or Mac something.
[1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:44.040]  I'd already spent years dealing with a brand name with Mac in it that was talking about
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:45.040]  iOS.
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:47.800]  And I also wanted the freedom to talk about other tech stuff that's not Apple related at
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:50.640]  all, but I also didn't want it to be just completely divorced.
[1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:53.200]  I wanted, I wanted to mean something to me, completely divorced from Apple.
[1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:57.840]  I was like, well, if I can tip my cap at Apple somehow and yet have it not be necessary
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:02.960]  to understanding just have it be an easy to scan site, a site name that that was what I was
[1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:03.960]  looking for.
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:07.280]  And I also wanted to be something that was kind of normal words and spellable and a
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:08.280]  dot com.
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:13.200]  Those were sort of all my rules because I did TV dot net, which was T E V E dot net.
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.720]  And there's nothing worse than having to spell it out.
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:16.800]  And then, and then point out, it's not a dot com.
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:17.800]  It's a dot net.
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:20.240]  And, you know, I just, I wanted to be simple.
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:25.720]  And then that, that struck me that classic, you know, the, it comes from the D interview
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:31.400]  that Steve Jobs did with Walton Cara about when he came back to Apple, wrapping back
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:34.800]  around at the beginning of the show in, in 96, 97.
[1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:39.280]  And he was amazed at how many good people were still there when he thought the company
[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:42.320]  should be just empty because it was in such dire straits.
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:47.000]  And, and the phrase that struck him at the time was somebody told him or multiple people
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:51.920]  told him that, you know, we bleed six colors here or I, or I bleed six colors that the
[1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:55.040]  classic Apple rainbow logo, which was the logo at the time.
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:56.040]  It's like, it's in my blood.
[1:52:56.040 --> 1:52:58.400]  This is Apple as part of who I am.
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:52:59.400]  And that struck Steve.
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:00.720]  It's like, oh, yeah, bleeding six colors.
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:01.720]  That makes sense.
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:02.720]  You love Apple.
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:03.720]  Like, I love Apple.
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:04.720]  Let's make some great stuff.
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:07.720]  And I, I felt like that was, that was, it's like, I'm not going to always praise everything
[1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:08.720]  Apple does.
[1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:09.720]  I'm going to criticize Apple.
[1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:10.720]  I'm going to try to be fair when I read about Apple.
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:14.440]  And I'm going to write about things that aren't Apple, but Apple has defined my career
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:16.960]  in tech journalism, there's no doubt about it.
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:21.800]  And it would be crazy for me not to find a way to, to reference that.
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:26.640]  And so I thought, you know, bleed six, six colors, bleed six colors, what, you know, let
[1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:27.640]  me look that up.
[1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:30.920]  And I found out that there were no websites called that.
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:33.360]  The dot com domain for it was available.
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:37.480]  It was owned by somebody, but it was just a site literally saying, make me an offer.
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:42.160]  And I thought, oh, well, it's like, and then I gave it a few days where I just thought,
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:46.880]  maybe, maybe not. Do I want to do this? What do I want to do? But I never went to a backup
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:49.880]  name because I thought, well, this is great. It doesn't say Mac, it doesn't say I.
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:56.040]  It's a dot com. It's regular English words. And so yeah, so then I ended up making, making
[1:53:56.040 --> 1:54:00.160]  those people an offer and transferring it to hover. And I bought six colors with a U for
[1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:04.800]  everybody in Commonwealth countries, redirects to the one without the U.
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:08.800]  It does it redirect or doesn't mirror it redirects it. And what I want to do at some
[1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:13.240]  point is write a script or something that mirrors it with all of the words swapped out
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:16.920]  for their English equivalents. But I haven't gotten to that point yet.
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:22.920]  Oh, maybe that would be a good addition to smarty pants. Englishify. Like, yeah, put a
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:28.040]  monicle on a top hat on it. But yeah, so it was, I'm glad you like it. I mean, I've
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:31.360]  gotten incredibly positive feedback from it, which is great, because you never expect
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:34.680]  positive feedback from anything on the internet. You expect people to grasp about it.
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:40.920]  You know, I've been, I've been happy to have the people say nice things about it. And
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.760]  yeah, I'm happy about it. I was, like I said, I expected this to be a real trial and for
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:49.080]  me to get something that was a compromise, because you hear those stories. Like Marco tells
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:52.600]  the story about overcast and how he had all these different ideas and, you know, things he
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:56.920]  couldn't get and things that didn't pass to pass a trademark search or anything like that.
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:02.440]  And, you know, for this, I was really just looking for a ideally a dot com domain. I would
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.240]  have taken some others probably if I could have come up with something clever. But, um,
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:10.280]  you know, this for me was a good fit. It's like if you get what it's referencing, then
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:14.400]  great. And if you don't, it doesn't matter. It's just, it's just a brand. I mean, like
[1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:19.160]  daring fireball is, uh, it's a good name. You know, it's a good name.
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:22.080]  It's, but it's funny though, because it's not enough to have a good name though, because
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:29.280]  well, I wonder about that today. Like, I know, uh, like Jason freed at, uh, base camp. I was
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.400]  going to say 37 seconds, but I always want to call them 37 seconds. I will for the rest
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:39.520]  of my life. But he, he's written about, uh, how domain names don't mean as much anymore.
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:44.960]  And they have base camp dot com now. Right. Um, but for, I think at least 10 years,
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:50.920]  they're based on HQ. Everybody who used base camp knows that it was HQ. And his thing was,
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.800]  look, man, people just Google base camp, you know, and then what, you know, when they
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:59.000]  have an account, they just start typing B in their auto, you know, in the address field,
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:05.020]  and it fills in. And when they're looking for it, they don't go to the website, they
[1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:09.440]  go to Google and they type base camp and basically, you know, we could be base camp HQX
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:15.480]  F G and, you know, they would get to us. Um, so I do think it's a little bit less important.
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:19.520]  I agree. Like it's better to have a good name that just sounds like a good name. Six
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:23.600]  colors. It sounds good rather than worry about the domain, but I still think that there's
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:30.000]  an art to getting a name where it looks like a good URL. You know, and every once in a while,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.200]  it's like, I'm trying to think of an example, but like a lot of times when you have like
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:40.720]  an S in the middle, it, it, it, if it's plural, like six is colors dot com. It's like,
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:46.320]  you know, it doesn't look good. It's like you, you lose the two words. You know, you want,
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:50.080]  if you're going to combine two words together, like daring fireball or six colors,
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.800]  you want it to be completely unambiguous even without camel case because that's how most people
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:58.480]  are going to see it. And every once in a while, you come up with a domain name. It's like two
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:03.200]  words put together. They sound great. The meaning is great, but then you look at them all lower
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:08.160]  case together and it's like, you can't read it. I mean, we had a lot of politics involving picking
[1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:12.880]  a name for the site that we launched at IDG and we chose tech hive. And there are a lot of things
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:17.600]  I love. I love the logo. I love the colors. I like the name, but in a browser, it looks terrible
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:21.520]  because it's the two h's in the middle. Yeah, that's a good perfect. That's exactly the sort of
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:26.800]  thing I'm talking about. Yeah. No, but it, again, it did, you know, but that's two h's in a row.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:32.160]  It's, it's exactly right. Whereas in, if it wasn't for the URL, you would never, it would never
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:36.640]  occur to you because the eight, the second h would always be uppercase in our biggest, they either
[1:57:36.640 --> 1:57:41.440]  be camel case or it would be two words with a space between them, but either way, it would be a
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:46.240]  lowercase h in a capital H and it wouldn't be a problem. Oh, I did get, and I've never even used this,
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:53.520]  it redirects, but I did get six color dot r s. Because I don't know why not. That's like
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:59.280]  Serbia, Serbian domain registrar has some of my money now, but I don't know. I bought a lot of domains
[1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:03.280]  when I was speculating about the, about the name. And that's why I have 16 domains in hover is I've
[1:58:03.280 --> 1:58:09.040]  got, I've got bleed six colors and bleed six and I've got numerals, six of something, but not of
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.000]  six colors. And, and a few other names that were in their Snell world, which is where I posted my
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:18.640]  like sort of resignation announcement thing that was just a placeholder until I could launch six
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:24.000]  colors. But, but yeah, I, it's a name, right? It's a name with real words. You don't have to
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.360]  explain it. And Daring Fireball is like that. I mean, people might ask, what does that mean?
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.800]  But the words are recognizable. It's an understandable concept. And I think, I think in the
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:36.480]  art of naming, that's what you want is you want something that is going to catch a little bit and be
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:40.560]  like, oh yeah, because yeah, even if the domain doesn't matter, although quite frankly, you're on
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:45.600]  a podcast or you're on a TV interview and somebody says, oh, where can people read about you?
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:50.320]  It helps, especially at the beginning to say six colors dot com because, you know, if you say,
[1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:54.480]  well, here's a weird URL, you have to go to it's less likely anybody's going to remember it,
[1:58:54.480 --> 1:59:00.400]  but they might remember the name. Did you get the digit six colors done? I did. And I, I would
[1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:04.480]  like to get that at some point, but it was quite frankly, it was too expensive. After I bought the
[1:59:04.480 --> 1:59:10.720]  others, I was like, wow, that's really pricey for just a redirect. And to your point about Google, um,
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:16.000]  I feel like after some amount of time of me doing this, um, I can decide whether I want to go ahead
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:22.720]  and buy that. And my feeling is at some point, those other alternatives are a lot less valuable
[1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:27.840]  because there's already a thing that is six colors dot com. And so numeral six colors dot com is not a,
[1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:30.960]  you know, they're going to think, well, it's, it's valuable if they can sell it to me,
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:35.600]  but nobody else is going to want it. So I hope to get them eventually, but I'm not going to pay
[1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:40.640]  an arm and a leg to get them just because they'll redirect. I've told this before, when I registered
[1:59:40.640 --> 1:59:46.480]  during fireball, I registered dot net and dot com at the same time. And I, I went with dot net as the
[1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:52.640]  canonical one, because, um, I, I've since grown out of it. And I guess if I had it to do all over again,
[1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:57.760]  I'd probably use the dot com. But at the time, I had a weird aversion to dot coms. I just thought,
[1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:04.000]  I don't know this, if it's an exploit, I cannot express it. It just felt like dot com meant you were
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:07.920]  like a big company. Well, there was a time when dot net was kind of cool. It was like a cool, like
[2:00:07.920 --> 2:00:13.760]  insidery, um, you know, we're, we're the techy people of the internet and we, we have dot net.
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:19.280]  We had, I had TV not net and dot org. I just didn't ever get dot com. Yeah, I don't know. It just
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:23.040]  seemed to me like a person with a site should not have a dot com. And I don't even know. I've
[2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:28.400]  never even asked him. I've always thought, maybe that's why cocky uses cocky dot org. Um, but I
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:32.720]  registered those two. And this is back at a time when they're really only three big ones dot net
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:39.120]  dot com dot org. And I didn't register dot org. Somebody else has it. It's this guy Peter house,
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:43.760]  something. If you go to daring fireball dot org, it's a guy who hosts his personal blog there.
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:46.800]  I swear to God, I swear to God.
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:52.800]  I'm crazy. And I bought the dot org for six colors. I've, you know, every once in a while, somebody
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:56.880]  will write to me and point it to me and be like, Hey, are you aware of this? But it's like the guy,
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:04.320]  he has an updated it's in two years. So, uh, and it was never popular. Um, so I just thought,
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:09.280]  it's not, it's not worth it. I don't know why he did it. I just seems to me like he's probably,
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:12.640]  it must be some kind of crazy person. It's also possible that his blog is somewhere else,
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:16.720]  but he's parked, he's parked that domain at the same IP address and it's just accepting
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:21.200]  all the, all the traffic. And so even though he's thinking that he's serving that at, you know,
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:27.040]  my, my blog dot peer house dot com, it's also still serving at daring fireball dot org. I don't
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:34.080]  know. That happened sometimes. Yeah. For a while, the guy who owns newspaper dot com,
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:38.480]  or at least he did own newspaper dot com had it redirecting to daring fireball.
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:45.440]  I didn't have it. I wasn't my domain. It was this, the guy who had it and it's a, you know,
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:50.720]  I don't know, newspaper dot com is probably pretty valuable domain. Maybe. It, it no longer,
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:55.520]  it still isn't a thing. If you go to newspaper dot com, it's like a sorry, we're down for the moment
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:01.520]  and there's an animation. But for a while, and it was just weird though, because, uh, it was like,
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:07.040]  I don't know, it was enough traffic on a daily basis that it showed up in my referrals. Like,
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:11.200]  I was like, what the hell is this newspaper dot com that is like my 15th highest referral? And I
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:16.400]  went to it and it was daring fireball. And I was like, what? And, and oh, and I, the other thing
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:21.680]  was while he was doing it, I would get, I would get about one or two offers a month to buy it.
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:26.080]  Sure. And I was like, it's not me. I was like, I don't know why it's pointing to my site, but it
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:31.280]  ain't me. Yeah, I, I remember there was a story about that. I think maybe even a site I did
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:35.680]  had that for a while where somebody owned it and they didn't want to give it to us or sell it to us,
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:39.120]  but they said, but I'm not using it. So I'll just redirect it to you for now. I was like,
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:43.920]  okay, that's, that doesn't really help me because I can't rely on it, but it's nice that you
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:48.800]  turn the spigot on us for a while. Um, you know, the story with TV dot com is that it was, uh,
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:54.400]  it was a blog on CNET for a while and a TEV. I think it was, no, it wasn't even CNET. It
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:59.200]  was like hotwire or something like that. And they got a wired digital got sold to like,
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:03.920]  like hosts or Alta Vista or something like that. And it basically got sucked into this giant
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:09.040]  internet company to, to the point where they were never using it. If you visited that dot com of my
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:12.560]  dot net dot org, if you went to the dot com, you just went to the search engine home page.
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:19.840]  And I spent years trying to get them to not even to sell it to me to find the person who is in
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.440]  charge of the domains at Terrasoft, like it was whatever to this, to this day, I have no idea.
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:29.360]  Just give me somebody to talk to you. Yeah, because you know, we just have this blog,
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:34.080]  you're not using it. It was the name of a blog on a website that you bought 10 years ago.
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:38.480]  They only did 10 posts or whatever. And then, and then they shut it down. And to this day,
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:47.680]  if you go to TEV, ee.com, you end up at insiderinfo.com. Um, at the Lycos network, um,
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:54.960]  which, uh, yeah, with, with a, uh, a form submission of SRC equals NM domains. I wonder if that's
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:04:02.000]  like all of our dead domains just redirect to this page, where they, uh, where they, uh,
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:05.840]  I don't even know what it's like a user submitted content or something like that. So they're
[2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:10.720]  renting out all these old domains, but it's like that they just, they got that domain domains are
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:14.800]  funny. They got that domain a million years ago. And they just keep paying and whatever they're
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:21.520]  paying as part of the thousand domains that they own and will pay for it forever. And, you know,
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:25.120]  that's always the problem when you're shopping for domains is, is that is that if it's, somebody
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:29.840]  wants to sell it, it's great. But if it's just inside the maw of a giant corporation, forget it,
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:39.120]  you just forget it. T V E, you see the problem here dot com dot com. Yeah, just redirect to like
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:44.320]  some kind of weird site, but dot neton dot org, you know, we, we still have actually. And that was,
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:49.760]  that was my, you know, that was a TV blog that my friends and I did for, for like 96 to,
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:55.840]  I don't even know when some time in the 2000s, ends up likeos is still a thing. I guess so. Or
[2:04:55.840 --> 2:05:00.800]  again, there's a company that's swallowed likeos that owns the, the assets and including all those
[2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:04.640]  domains that they bought. And they still run it. And no, I just went there. They still operate
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:10.960]  as a search engine. Wow. Yep. I have a lot of likeos. It's amazing. It's amazing. And it may
[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:15.840]  even be powered by somebody else, but it's, it's, it's still there. So you can still go there and
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:19.760]  get searchers. Nice. So I'm sure they're really good. I wonder if their search results from the 90s.
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:26.000]  That'd be funny. I searched for Jason Snell on it to redirect me to Snell world. So,
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:31.120]  well, that's not bad. They're up to date. That's not bad. I was at my mom's house and she found a
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:36.480]  thing I did at Mac user again, bringing it back around called the internet roadmap. And it was like
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:42.720]  literally this, this subscription premium, I think, or maybe it was a new stand premium. It was
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:47.120]  like a roadmap, except it was of sites on the internet. And they were all interconnected. And it
[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:51.440]  was actually a project we did where we went from site to site with links. Each site had to link to
[2:05:51.440 --> 2:05:58.800]  the next site in a chain. And it is crazy. Um, but the, the funny thing about it is that the backbone
[2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:05.520]  of that that we used to really make it functional was Yahoo at Stanford. When they were the just
[2:06:05.520 --> 2:06:09.840]  a, like a link directory. And we would use that to link out to the sites. And literally they were
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:14.880]  like 150 sites on the map. And it was most of the internet in 1995 or whenever that was.
[2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:22.160]  So old. I had to look this up. I actually looked it up through likeos. Okay. But talking about
[2:06:22.160 --> 2:06:29.120]  domain name. Forget it. Go, go, go. It's a classic McSweenie article. You had to have seen this
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:35.760]  from 2004 written by Michael Ward and its email addresses. It would be really annoying to give
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:44.000]  out over the phone. It's, it's much more of a visual joke than a verbal joke because of the
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:50.160]  nature of the email addresses. But it's like, for example, imagine if your surname were underscore.
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:07:00.960]  Mike underscore 2004 and Yahoo.com. I'll just put it in the show notes. The rest of these,
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:07.840]  I don't want to spoil it. But it's a funny little five item list gag. I'll put it in the show notes.
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.440]  I've started doing more show notes. That's good. I don't know if people I know if you've noticed.
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:18.160]  Yeah, it's, I used to be really lazy about it. But I feel like it's one of the little things
[2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:22.560]  that can do to make the show a little better. Well, you know, people are in their cars and they hear
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:26.640]  about something that's going to be interesting. And then they, you know, get to work and they forget
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:32.240]  and they're like, oh, yeah, what was that thing? And it's hard to look back at, at, you know,
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:36.720]  scan through two hours of podcast when you can just go to the show notes and be like, oh, yeah,
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:40.240]  that's the thing I was looking for. It's like, it's like your pre Insta paper ring the show for them.
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:47.360]  Yeah, exactly. And it's a pain. I mean, it's totally a pain. But I, as you do it as you go along,
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:51.920]  it's a little bit easier. I've started to do that with incomparable and with clockwise. Mike
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:56.880]  does it for upgrade, but, you know, just somebody mentioned something and I just write it down.
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:00.160]  It's like, and it's a pain to do that because it gets you a little bit out of the flow of your
[2:08:00.160 --> 2:08:06.000]  concentration of the, of the conversation. But at the same time, it kind of beats having to go back
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  later and say, where did they mention something? And, you know, and people do like it, people
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:17.200]  appreciate it when you add those links in. I had Rene on, on the last episode. And I think he,
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:22.800]  he even wrote on, I'm more, that he was on over 300 podcasts last year. And I knew I already
[2:08:22.800 --> 2:08:28.000]  had already asked you to do the next episode. I do think I've gotten back to back the two most
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:34.480]  prolific podcasters on the Mac web. How many podcasts do you think you do here? Oh, man. And you're
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:40.240]  probably doing more. So maybe a better question is how many are you on pace to do? Yeah, I don't
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:45.920]  know. Mike Hurley probably has me beat or it's close. I would say if I keep doing what I've been
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:54.640]  doing now next year, let me do, I'm going to do some launch bar math here. Um, let's see,
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:09:03.680]  I'd say, oh, man, 250. So you're at ballpark, right? I mean, we're talking like, if somebody
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:07.760]  wanted to listen to every show that you're on, let me show that Rene's on, they're talking 500
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:14.000]  episodes. Yeah, I mean, it goes, it goes, it goes fast. And I don't expect anybody to be a
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:20.800]  complete this. But yeah, so basically I'm doing four weekly podcasts. Um, I'm not the center of all
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:25.600]  four. Um, I mean, I do the one with Tim Goodman from the Hollywood Reporter and we talk about TV
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:30.160]  because he's the TV critic at the Hollywood Reporter. And I'm the, I'm kind of the classic Dan Benjamin
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:34.800]  role in that where I'm facilitating it and producing it and posting it. And really it's like,
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:39.600]  I'm asking questions of the guy who's the expert on TV because he's TV critic of the Hollywood
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:45.120]  Reporter. That's a very different kind of show to do than incomparable or like clockwise is just
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:49.920]  a half an hour and it's me and Dan more. And then upgrade is me a lot of me, but Mike produces that
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:54.320]  one. So, you know, each of them takes a little bit, a different amount of time. But yeah, if you put
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:00.080]  those together and multiply them by 52, that's 208 podcasts right there. And then there are some
[2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:05.840]  others that are like I did, uh, I did a podcast after every episode of Game of Thrones last year
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:12.000]  and, or this year and Dr. Who as well. And so that, that's an extra like 23 episodes. And then
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.880]  we do our little done. And those were under that those were under the incomparable and those were
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:24.080]  the flash casts were under TV actually TV. I'm reusing the names and the logo. I think if you just
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:32.800]  pronounce it TV TV, yeah, TV, um, longies. Anyway, we put it there because I, I don't know, I, I'm torn.
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.520]  I could basically have like five podcasts a week in the main incomparable feed. And I, I feel like
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:41.360]  that's, that would be litter. So there's like a master feed with everything. And then you can just
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:45.760]  subscribe to the individual podcast if you want to. Um, and then we do the Dungeons and Dragons
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:49.840]  thing, which is literally we play Dungeons and Dragons once every six weeks for like four hours.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:55.200]  And then that comes out every other week in a one hour chunk. So it's not a lot of time. Um,
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:59.920]  and it's fun. But that is another podcast that I'm on. And then I say yes to be on other people's
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:05.520]  podcasts like this one. So it's a lot. There's a lot of podcasting. We'll see how, how long I last.
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:09.760]  I wish podcasting was more like a aerobic exercise because I could really use some more exercise
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:16.320]  and instead I'm just doing a lot of podcasting. I'd be very healthy if podcasting was, uh, more
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:20.720]  aerobic than it is. I've been dreading this the whole time. I've been putting off the end of
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:26.080]  this show, but I feel like I've got to run it by almost an apology is that I've got one more
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:32.320]  episode of the talk show scheduled for 2014. And it's, it's going to be a special episode on
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:41.600]  Star Wars. Oh. And, and I, it, I didn't invite you. That's okay. I know, I, I know, I, I forgive
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:47.680]  you. I know way more, I know, I know so many huge Star Wars fans and I am not, I'm not one of those.
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:51.520]  I, I like Star Wars a lot. And I'm happy to talk. We talked about it on the incomparable a
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:56.720]  million times for millions of hours and Syracuse and Dan Morin and I did an out more than an hour
[2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:01.600]  on the trailer for the Force Awakens, right? But, you know, in, in, even in our sphere, I could
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:06.320]  list off a whole bunch of people who were bigger Star Wars fans than, than me, including you and,
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:11.680]  and John Syracuse and Dan Morin. Now, it's going to be me. It's going to be Syracuse and, uh,
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:15.760]  and then to keep us straight and sort of, and sort of keep us from getting too serious,
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:21.280]  guy English. Oh, that's good. Oh, that's, that's perfect. I love, I love the guy much. Well, my thing
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:28.800]  is I feel like I, I cannot be responsible. I can't be the host for more than, uh, a panel of three,
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:35.360]  including me, uh, because it's, it's, it's beyond my can as a, as a host. That would also be like
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:41.440]  eight hours long. If, if you were just completely just free to talk about Star Wars, that's the,
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:46.000]  that's, I, I, I don't know if I said this before, but I'm going to mention it here because I'm not
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  sure I've said it anywhere. One of my favorite moments in waiting in line for an Apple Keynote ever
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:55.520]  was, uh, you and me and I think like Dan Morin and I don't know if Syracuse was there because I
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:59.920]  think it was the press area before at WWDC. And we were talking about Raiders of the Lost Ark for,
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.640]  like 20 minutes. And there was that moment when the doors started to accordion up and you looked at me
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:09.120]  and you're like, forget this, let's just go talk about Raiders of the Lost Ark some more. It was,
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:13.200]  I was good stuff. That was, that was, I almost took you up on it. It's like, yeah, that would be fun.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.240]  But that was the incomparable. I did, I did the incomparable then with Raiders, right? Yeah,
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:22.400]  yeah, that was you and me and Dan talking about it. Yeah, I have to do one of those again some time,
[2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:28.080]  uh, you know, on something, uh, something that you, that you really like that, uh, that we could
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:31.840]  cover because that was a, that was a good one. And one, one of the, I still hear from people who
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:35.360]  listen to that one partially. It's like, oh, John Gruber was on the incomparable. I should
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:40.160]  listen to that. But the whole goal of that show from the beginning was, uh, it's a catalog show.
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:44.080]  You should be able to go back to 2010 when we recorded that one and listen. I mean,
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:48.560]  Raiders of the Lost Ark isn't any different. It's, it's, you know, it's, it's fixed in time and
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:52.080]  you should be able to go and pick that episode off the shelf and listen to it and get something out
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:57.280]  of it, you know, and I think you can. Um, and I, that was always the intent and I'm happy that,
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:01.680]  you know, four or plus years later, um, that that's still true. That's, that's still one of my
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:04.960]  favorites because it's one of my favorite movies. In fact, I, I look back and I think boy, we should
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:09.040]  have gone for like two or three hours on that, not just one. Yeah, exactly. I think it was when
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:15.040]  we had an artificial timeline. Oh, shooting for an hour. Yeah. Um, I always, I always want, you say
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:19.120]  it hasn't changed and isn't going to change. I always imagined in the back of my head that like
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.880]  every Monday, Spielberg comes into the office at Amblin and there's like a stack of like
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:30.720]  three pink slips that say George George Lucas called the ones, wants to talk to Raiders
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:36.480]  to the lost star, especially edition. He just, he just picked some off the spike. It's been
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:41.040]  the trash kit. That's, yeah. No. I mean, it's actually bad enough that the packaging is now
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:47.920]  labeled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the lost dark, which is just unacceptable. Yeah. George
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:52.320]  called the added idea that the boulder could be on fire. Yeah. That would be much better.
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:56.800]  Let's insert a scene in CGI where bellock is already in Egypt.
[2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:04.160]  George called the added idea. There's a whole fleet of airplanes waiting on the river,
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:09.200]  not just one. Yeah. Instead of traveling across the map, they travel across a 3D globe.
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:17.600]  That would be good. Did you see somebody put together a special edition of the Force Awakens trailer?
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:21.520]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did it. And they did like a killer. I should have to put that in the
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:26.880]  show notes. They did like a killer job. Like somebody actually who knows what they're doing, like with the VFX,
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:33.200]  like, and, yeah, it's just more like we're buzzing junk in Tatooine. And yeah, I mean,
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:42.400]  it is. Well, like, it's only funny because it's not even an exaggeration because it's
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:46.640]  exactly the sort of stuff that did happen in the special edition of the Star Wars movies. But
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:50.320]  like there's the scene where you see all of a sudden you see the Millennium Falcon and it's
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.960]  like being chased by like three tie fighters. Well, now it's being chased by 45 fighters.
[2:15:56.640 --> 2:15:58.160]  More exciting that way. Clearly.
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:05.920]  Anyway, so everybody out there, if you want to, if you're listening to this, this show will
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:11.040]  air first and then the Star Wars special edition. If you want to warm up for a holiday week,
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:17.440]  uh, end of the holiday season special talk show, uh, pop your favorite Star Wars movies into your
[2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:24.400]  uh, movie player of choice. That's good advice. All right. Jason Snell, it's going to let you go.
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:30.720]  I think, I think we've, we've rattled on long enough, traveled on long enough. I, I appreciate the
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:35.600]  invite. It's always, it's always nice to talk to you and, and hopefully no, uh, calamitous things
[2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:41.360]  will be before me in the next couple of days after this one. I'll tell you what, if they do anything
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:45.120]  that happens in the next week. I think we're going to have to call this. Yeah, that may be, I may
[2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:51.920]  actually ask you to delete the episode. Just salty earth. Forget it. All right. Thank you, Jason.
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:57.760]  Thanks, John. Hey, have a good new year. You too. I appreciate the invite anytime. Okay. See you
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:23.040]  soon. Probably so. All right. I'm, uh, hit and stop.
