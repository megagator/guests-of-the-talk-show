[00:00.000 --> 00:04.880]  hello from beautiful southern california
[00:04.880 --> 00:11.280]  hello from very cold dark philadelphia oh i expect nothing less from philly no
[00:11.280 --> 00:15.520]  you're still in southern cal yeah well so i was in uh i was in arizona
[00:15.520 --> 00:18.560]  so we like came through la we go out to my mom's place in arizona and then we
[00:18.560 --> 00:21.120]  come back through because it's such a long drive you can't really drive direct
[00:21.120 --> 00:22.960]  from san francisco to phoenix because the
[00:22.960 --> 00:26.400]  mountains are in the way so it's about halfway to my in-laws so we
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.880]  spent a day here coming down and a couple days going back so it's a
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.440]  twofer all the grandparents are visible and uh
[00:33.440 --> 00:36.560]  that's a pretty good trip love driving though i'll come back to
[00:36.560 --> 00:38.640]  that because there's something we wrote about recently i want to
[00:38.640 --> 00:41.920]  i want to touch on with the road trip but uh
[00:41.920 --> 00:45.280]  big picture last time you were on this show
[00:45.280 --> 00:49.840]  oh yeah you were still the editorial director for macworld
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.880]  for like 48 hours yeah yeah it was the it was the night before the apple event
[00:54.880 --> 00:58.640]  it was like september 8th i think yeah was it was that it or was it the
[00:58.640 --> 01:01.280]  seventh i we might have recorded the seventh and
[01:01.280 --> 01:03.840]  published the eighth yeah i think that's i think that's right i think i remember
[01:03.840 --> 01:05.520]  sending a note to dave whiskas saying like
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.120]  uh it's like it's gonna go up before the apple event because nobody's gonna want
[01:09.120 --> 01:10.880]  to listen to it afterward but yeah it was
[01:10.880 --> 01:15.200]  we were right on the cusp of the apple event and then the the macworld layoffs
[01:15.200 --> 01:18.400]  and everything happened the next day
[01:18.720 --> 01:22.240]  yeah that was uh that was uh pretty funny because i was like
[01:22.240 --> 01:25.600]  oh like i i talked to john about it and i was like no i can't talk to john about
[01:25.600 --> 01:29.120]  it because it's so so so what big new things are
[01:29.120 --> 01:33.600]  going to happen this week uh i'm i'm frightened well there's going
[01:33.600 --> 01:36.080]  to be a new year because the earth goes around the sun
[01:36.080 --> 01:41.120]  and nothing we can do can stop that so uh it's going to be 2015 so there's
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.960]  something and beyond that uh let's hope nothing uh
[01:44.960 --> 01:48.080]  i could i uh i could use a little less uh uh
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.920]  fewer interesting events post talk show so it fascinates me though it really
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.280]  does because you know in the grand scheme of things
[01:57.280 --> 02:00.240]  september is not that long ago it's you know
[02:00.240 --> 02:03.200]  three months yeah
[02:04.160 --> 02:12.560]  yet somehow your new role doing your thing at six colors and
[02:12.560 --> 02:15.840]  you know it all seems settled already that you know
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.360]  settled is not quite right but it feels normal to me now that you're writing at
[02:19.360 --> 02:22.800]  six colors and you know macworld as we knew it doesn't
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.000]  exist anymore i appreciate that it's um i mean
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.040]  one of the big things and i've said this on other podcasts too i i it's not like
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.200]  i wasn't planning on leaving i wasn't entirely sure i mean uh and i've
[02:35.200 --> 02:37.680]  said on other podcasts too and i'll say it to you directly i mean you are
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.440]  obviously a huge inspiration and jim dalrymple and federico vatici and
[02:41.440 --> 02:44.400]  other people i know who have gone out on their own john moltz and
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.080]  done their own websites and you know and some podcasts and some freelance and all
[02:48.080 --> 02:51.040]  of that and i had been thinking about that for a while
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.000]  and in fact a year ago i started basically putting together a home office
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.840]  in my garage because my i we had no workspace in the house it's a
[02:59.840 --> 03:04.560]  it's a pretty small house and uh and the garage was uh we bought a
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.440]  minivan a few years ago and you couldn't can't park the minivan in the garage
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.000]  it's too big and so the garage became when we were
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.720]  redoing our kitchen it was a place where all the junk in the house went while we
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.120]  were redoing it and then that all came back in and sort of like
[03:15.120 --> 03:18.560]  what do we do in the garage and i was increasingly unhappy with my job and i
[03:18.560 --> 03:21.360]  kept thinking you know the garage needs to be a home office and
[03:21.360 --> 03:24.720]  i started building it and the entire intent was not to have really nice work
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.960]  at home days the intent was that that would be my
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.680]  office eventually because i would leave macworld and i would want
[03:29.680 --> 03:33.040]  to at least try to do my own thing rather than
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.440]  go you know they we had always joked um one of the past presidents of macworld
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.320]  and i joked that like oh jason will be the last one to turn the lights off at
[03:40.320 --> 03:42.960]  macworld at the end macworld will be just jason in his
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.640]  garage um doing macworld and i had that moment
[03:46.640 --> 03:49.760]  when i was watching you and federico and jim and people like that
[03:49.760 --> 03:53.200]  that um i thought to myself well one if i'm
[03:53.200 --> 03:56.320]  people can do that on their own i don't need to do that
[03:56.320 --> 03:59.920]  here and if i'm going to do that i want to own it i want to be that the person
[03:59.920 --> 04:04.160]  who does that not uh just kind of uh doing all my work
[04:04.160 --> 04:06.960]  toward the you know mysterious overlords who own a
[04:06.960 --> 04:09.440]  company who owns a company that owns a company that owns
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.840]  macworld and so i was i was planning it so in a way i've been thinking about it
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.240]  for a long time for more than a year and then there was the
[04:18.240 --> 04:24.000]  so we we saw each other at uh xoxo right afterward too so i i i got to see you a
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.440]  couple of times right around that crazy time and i saw you at the apple event so
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.480]  i saw you three times in like a week um and uh
[04:32.480 --> 04:35.360]  what was really funny about that time is that because of the timing because we
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.560]  got the the iphone review units and the iphone reviews
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.400]  were all going to drop the following week and i had this moment where a
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.320]  normal person would have said i just left my job of 17 years i'm going to
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.920]  take a few weeks to recalibrate and decide what i'm going to do next and for
[04:49.920 --> 04:53.360]  me it was one i'd already been thinking about what i wanted to do next
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.480]  and two i had that iphone and i was like well everybody
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.280]  everybody knows the biggest time of year for writing about apple stuff is when
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.640]  the new iphones and ios and mac os come out and that's now so i thought you know
[05:04.640 --> 05:07.200]  what i gotta launch the site like next week
[05:07.200 --> 05:10.960]  and so like literally less than a week after i left macworld six colors
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.080]  launched not because i'm a total crazy person but
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.280]  because i felt like i couldn't not be out there at that moment um
[05:19.280 --> 05:22.800]  so i think it's those two things it's that i managed to hit that site when
[05:22.800 --> 05:25.280]  when we were at the high season for apple stuff and because i've been
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.080]  thinking about it for so long that i was ready to make it happen um
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.160]  and that you know and and it does feel and it feels great too so it feels right
[05:34.160 --> 05:38.400]  to be doing it so i think all of those things maybe feed into why it feels like
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.840]  a natural thing and not some like crazy thing that just happened a couple months
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.600]  ago even though that's sort of what happened
[05:43.600 --> 05:49.760]  how how long were you at uh idg uh well i was a macworld macworld 17
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.280]  years um i've been doing this a little more
[05:53.280 --> 05:58.400]  than 20 coming up 21 years of sort of full-time apple stuff but that
[05:58.400 --> 06:01.600]  counts accounts of davis so so i was a mac user
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.840]  until 97 94 to 97 and then and then what happened is that um
[06:05.840 --> 06:09.840]  which is a just a hilarious moment in apple history right 97
[06:09.840 --> 06:13.280]  jobs is coming back but but apple is dying
[06:13.280 --> 06:16.160]  and everybody's thinking oh apple's going to go out at macworld expo they
[06:16.160 --> 06:19.440]  actually have the cache infusion from microsoft to keep the
[06:19.440 --> 06:22.720]  lights on and meanwhile they're working on the imac
[06:22.720 --> 06:26.480]  and at that moment that summer right before the bill gates thing at macworld
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.080]  expo in boston the executives at idg and ziv davis said
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.800]  we need to cut our losses because apple is going to die
[06:32.800 --> 06:36.480]  and we've got these two magazines and these two big staff so why don't we just
[06:36.480 --> 06:42.320]  share the risk um put the put the two organizations together lay off half of
[06:42.320 --> 06:45.680]  each staff and just sort of stick them all together and make one magazine
[06:45.680 --> 06:48.960]  and we'll we'll do that because apple's a loser we need to get out of this
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.880]  business it was the single worst time uh
[06:52.880 --> 06:56.560]  just terrible timing because you know a couple months later even it was clear
[06:56.560 --> 06:59.440]  that apple was going to be probably okay and then very rapidly
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.520]  after that much better than okay um and so as a result i went over to
[07:03.520 --> 07:07.040]  macworld and it was this weird 50 50 joint venture where
[07:07.040 --> 07:11.280]  you know these two arch enemy companies co-owned our company and were at each
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.280]  other's throats except for us and that was really bizarre
[07:15.280 --> 07:18.320]  and then after a couple of years you know ziff davis was going through they
[07:18.320 --> 07:22.480]  were getting bought and rebought and different investors and had all sorts of
[07:22.480 --> 07:26.240]  financial problems because the guy who started that company retired his sons
[07:26.240 --> 07:29.280]  didn't want to take over the family business so they sold it off
[07:29.280 --> 07:33.440]  there were you know it was a financial mess was that ziff or was that davis
[07:33.440 --> 07:36.880]  it was bill bill ziff and the ziff brothers his kids
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.040]  were like screw this media crap uh we're gonna be
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.120]  you know venture capitalists and so they just sold the business and they sold it
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.120]  to i mean it's kind of inside baseball but
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.440]  they sold it to uh i think teddy forstman who was like at
[07:51.440 --> 07:54.640]  one point had been romantically linked to princess diana i mean like crazy
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.320]  stuff and then he sold it like a year later to masayoshi son of
[07:58.320 --> 08:02.560]  softbank in japan who was who bought it i think teddy forstman
[08:02.560 --> 08:05.120]  picked up a billion dollars by holding it for a year
[08:05.120 --> 08:08.400]  pretty good deal good job teddy um and then
[08:08.400 --> 08:11.760]  softbank talk about ancient history though like just think about the basic
[08:11.760 --> 08:14.720]  story of picking up a billion dollars by holding
[08:14.720 --> 08:17.760]  a mostly print focused by yeah magazine publisher
[08:17.760 --> 08:22.160]  oh yeah for a year well i mean it was not worth what masayoshi son paid for it
[08:22.160 --> 08:24.960]  i think i was a visionary but he was also kind of crazy and the money he was
[08:24.960 --> 08:28.240]  spending was kind of crazy he's still around doing other stuff but
[08:28.240 --> 08:31.600]  anyway so that was all so messed up that ziv davis was like
[08:31.600 --> 08:36.960]  uh we want money and idg was very much like oh well we we messed this up and we
[08:36.960 --> 08:39.520]  want to be in the apple business mac world was the first
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.560]  apple you know mac publication we want to keep that going
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.560]  and so they bought him out so the answer to the question is i was probably an idg
[08:46.560 --> 08:49.920]  you know my start date as an employee was was 20 years
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.920]  but my my idg employee start date was different and that was like
[08:53.920 --> 08:56.960]  uh the end of 97 or the beginning of 98 and then
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.720]  you know the buyout happened like around 99 or 2000 so
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.640]  it's a weird situation where i i ended up never having to fill out a resume
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.360]  and had like worked for three different owners it's very strange i only in the
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.640]  in the media i think this crazy stuff like that happened right and you mean
[09:12.640 --> 09:15.200]  you must have been really really young when you started at
[09:15.200 --> 09:17.440]  mac user it must have been right out of college right
[09:17.440 --> 09:20.800]  yeah i i went to um when i finished college i uh
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.640]  all the my friends who got jobs in in media were like working at weekly
[09:24.640 --> 09:27.840]  newspapers for like eleven thousand dollars a year and i
[09:27.840 --> 09:30.640]  basically said no forget it i'm not going to do that and
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.000]  so i went to journalism school and although i enjoyed my time at
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.520]  journalism school a lot the fact is my my college newspaper was my journalism
[09:37.520 --> 09:40.720]  school and i learned how to write news stories and features and edit stories
[09:40.720 --> 09:43.680]  and all of that at the newspaper uh the things i learned
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.000]  in at berkeley journalism school were that i didn't want to do tv news
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.280]  because i tried and i didn't like it um and
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.560]  i met i made contacts i'm i met people including
[09:54.560 --> 09:57.920]  one of the editors at mac user who taught a class there and she got me an
[09:57.920 --> 10:02.240]  internship so i was an intern in 93
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.800]  when i was 22 and i had a job january 94 so yeah i was 23
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.280]  when i started full-time so pretty young i think that the historical context that
[10:11.280 --> 10:17.040]  you have to remember is that the 96 97 was a terrible time for
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.000]  apple so worst and and a terrible even worse
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.200]  probably even worse than apple itself was the perception
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.160]  where even they really were in trouble by any objective measure the company was
[10:28.160 --> 10:31.440]  was in serious serious trouble both technically
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.880]  and financially but even given that i think that the general perception was
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.200]  even worse that it was i mean to say doom and gloom
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.920]  it's it's it it's not you can't overstate it
[10:45.920 --> 10:48.960]  that the perception was truly remember that
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.240]  i remember that we would be like look guys it's not quite that bad right but
[10:52.240 --> 10:55.440]  it was it was very much i think about this now when when the
[10:55.440 --> 10:58.400]  apple because apple is doomed has been a meme that's been around forever and it
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.400]  continues to this day and on one level you know the people who
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.840]  make the arguments today the facts of what they're arguing tend
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.040]  are arguing tend to be stupid they're like that's not really a fact or
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.880]  that's that you're not looking at the whole picture
[11:10.880 --> 11:14.400]  but in the back of my mind i always have that moment of let's see what they're
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.240]  arguing here because i was present at a time when doom and gloom was happening
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.960]  and there was doom and there was gloom and it at the time it did seem like it
[11:22.960 --> 11:27.040]  was a little overstated but you know the fact was that that um
[11:27.040 --> 11:29.680]  i don't think it was overstated in that year
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.840]  uh in like 96 97 in the gill amelio and um them searching for a new operating
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.680]  system and and steve jobs coming in that seemed
[11:39.680 --> 11:42.000]  to be the point where they were burning money
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.920]  and not selling a lot and the clones were eating their lunch in terms of
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.600]  hardware sales so even their their big install base was not really
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.960]  benefiting them and that was where they were um that was
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.240]  that was when they were falling apart and and that's the era that you get the
[11:56.240 --> 11:59.360]  kind of you know sell the company and give the
[11:59.360 --> 12:02.480]  money back to the shareholders kind of quotes is that was a moment where it was
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.240]  unclear whether the the executives at that time were
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.160]  gonna listen to the advice of uh you know
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.400]  analysts and and pundits and like become a software company and try to be
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.160]  microsoft windows and end up being like os2 and dying
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.600]  and uh and jobs to his credit one of the things he did when he came back and it
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.520]  was extremely unpopular was kill the clones and say no no no we
[12:25.520 --> 12:28.400]  need to control the hardware we're not going to just be an os
[12:28.400 --> 12:30.320]  company we're going to control the hardware
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.400]  and that decision actually factored into the publishing companies deciding to
[12:34.400 --> 12:40.000]  to fold mac user into mac world was all the ad revenue was coming from those
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.880]  clone makers too and that just vanished motorola and uh
[12:44.880 --> 12:48.320]  power uh power computing motorola um super mac
[12:48.320 --> 12:51.360]  which was i think umax did it but they called them super mac because they got
[12:51.360 --> 12:54.320]  that license from apple for like scanners but it turned out they could
[12:54.320 --> 12:57.200]  use it for anything so they called they could call them super mac
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.640]  what was the power what were the power computing ones called a power tower
[13:00.640 --> 13:05.520]  power wave um i had a power wave which was the which
[13:05.520 --> 13:08.320]  was a you know that was my one non-apple computer
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.080]  that i've ever bought was the power computing power wave
[13:12.080 --> 13:15.200]  power tower pro they had a whole bunch of power related
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.520]  things i i never owned one but i'd uh we had a i used a couple it was way the
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.760]  the power wave um and the power tower pro they were way better than the power
[13:25.760 --> 13:28.160]  max of the era i really i really do believe i mean they
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.200]  were all beige they were like they were apple gray or you could get power
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.760]  computing beige but they were all beige boxes but
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.560]  they were they were pretty cool they were like essentially power computing
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.360]  was like dell i think it was all dell executives in in austin and they were
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.560]  trying to use dell build to order you know you order it
[13:44.560 --> 13:46.480]  and then we make it and then we ship it to you
[13:46.480 --> 13:50.720]  technologies to to cut cut their margins and have no inventory
[13:50.720 --> 13:54.800]  and it was a pretty well-run company i mean and i guess well-run enough
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.840]  that not only was it really the number one clone maker but well-run enough that
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.040]  they had enough leverage of some kind that apple just bought them out
[14:01.040 --> 14:05.520]  right rather than just letting them die or fight them legally
[14:05.520 --> 14:08.640]  exactly because there would have been lawsuits for sure right because ios 8
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.040]  or not ios 8 see there we go mac os 8 we see i would have called it
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.240]  my mistake would have been to call it system 8 system 8 sure
[14:16.240 --> 14:21.680]  mac os 8 was um a major update and what uh apple what jobs realized and his
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.320]  people when they came back is that the clone licenses were for
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.400]  system 7 so they basically said this is os 8 and you don't get it
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.760]  and that was how they killed the clones it was pretty simple really nice and
[14:31.760 --> 14:34.960]  clean and then they ended up paying some people off including buying the assets
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.600]  of of power computing right because the
[14:37.600 --> 14:40.240]  original plan for mac os 8 was a little bit more ambitious
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.720]  than what it ended up being it was more or less like a nicely
[14:44.720 --> 14:50.080]  cleaned up version of system 7.6 yeah went but with the theme to make it look
[14:50.080 --> 14:52.960]  new right right never underestimate how much a
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.400]  new window chrome can make uh make it look like something new that it
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.160]  wasn't but here's the thing at the historical context so apple was in
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.800]  severe trouble and it's no surprise that that ziff davis and idg would would make
[15:04.800 --> 15:07.680]  a deal like that but it is funny like you said like
[15:07.680 --> 15:10.160]  people don't remember this and i was on the outside i wasn't
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.520]  writing uh you know i wasn't writing anything
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.120]  you know for magazines at the time yet um but i was in
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.280]  you know no surprise a very avid reader of both mac user and mac world
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.720]  uh all through the 90s so i was aware of this
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.760]  but that it was this weird strange bedfellows thing
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.880]  where when they unified the two it was this joint venture between
[15:32.880 --> 15:36.560]  the two arch rival tech publishing companies so with a staff comprised of
[15:36.560 --> 15:39.920]  the two of of half of like literally we're gonna
[15:39.920 --> 15:42.800]  lay off half your colleagues and then we're gonna stick you with
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.680]  your arch enemies go make a magazine good luck it was it wasn't just the
[15:47.680 --> 15:52.160]  owners it was like the staff we were we were uh the yankees and the red socks
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.600]  okay and uh all of it because i have i have to
[15:55.600 --> 15:57.520]  use baseball metaphors when i'm on the talk show
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.120]  uh and suddenly they're like okay we're gonna release half the yankees and half
[16:01.120 --> 16:03.840]  the red socks and then you're gonna have a new team good luck
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.120]  make the chemistry work and it was a disaster it really was
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.840]  i i was always uh and there were they were very different magazines i think
[16:11.840 --> 16:14.960]  that you know from the outside view mac world
[16:14.960 --> 16:22.320]  was a little bit more staid and buttoned up and formal in tone
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.640]  and in coverage and mac user was a little bit more
[16:26.640 --> 16:32.080]  casual and more like personal computer like user centric you
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.120]  know like you're you're we're assuming that you're a little bit more likely to
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.880]  be a home user or a student or an enthusiast and mac
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.240]  world was a little bit more for the perfect you know you're using a
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.600]  mac at work yeah and it was it had a more authoritative tone it was actually
[16:45.600 --> 16:48.320]  the i think the tagline was the macintosh authority
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.720]  at one point and and it was the prestige i mean it had a bigger staff it had a
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.360]  bigger budget mac user was always a little more
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.040]  homespun a little more um just as a reader and i
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.040]  was a reader of both and and before i started at mac user and
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.960]  uh it was a little more of the rebels and the users
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.160]  and people who who don't go back that far
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.600]  an analog would be something like mac addict a little bit mac addict was even
[17:13.600 --> 17:18.640]  more so i think than mac user a rebellious kind of thing but that was
[17:18.640 --> 17:23.280]  definitely the the voice difference between mac user and mac world
[17:23.280 --> 17:25.840]  which is funny because when you think about it on another level they were like
[17:25.840 --> 17:28.880]  the two magazines in the us that were monthly that had roughly the same
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.160]  budget you know mac world was bigger than mac users but roughly the same
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.280]  doing the same thing their headquarters at the end there were
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.320]  like two blocks away from each other so these are you couldn't find things that
[17:38.320 --> 17:41.360]  were more similar and yet the output was different and the staffs
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.080]  were different and the culture was different so it's kind of funny that
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.320]  even though we had all of these things in common
[17:46.320 --> 17:49.680]  the products were different and the the people were different
[17:49.680 --> 17:53.680]  i and i i do think too as an outside observer and someone who was very
[17:53.680 --> 17:56.160]  critical i thought both were excellent magazines
[17:56.160 --> 18:03.920]  i agree especially compared to the other pc type magazines of the era
[18:03.920 --> 18:07.280]  you know we were we were in the same building as like pc computing
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.640]  and and there was also pc mag and pc world
[18:10.640 --> 18:14.000]  and i didn't read them a lot but um you know
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.240]  yeah and mac world was full of the old mac world was full of people who really
[18:18.240 --> 18:20.240]  they wanted to be in the magazine business
[18:20.240 --> 18:23.680]  and they had high aspirations and you would see it and mac user
[18:23.680 --> 18:26.400]  it was a combination you look at their issues when they come out and you'd be
[18:26.400 --> 18:28.480]  like oh wow look what they did with that because
[18:28.480 --> 18:31.440]  they did the same story as a lot of them that we did right there's a new apple
[18:31.440 --> 18:33.600]  product how are we going to do it how are they going to do it and you could
[18:33.600 --> 18:36.400]  just compare which is like that is some serious
[18:36.400 --> 18:40.160]  competition like you you put it to bed and you wait two weeks and then suddenly
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.760]  out of the mailbox comes the competition what did they do and
[18:43.760 --> 18:46.960]  did you beat them did they beat you and they they would
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.160]  you would look at some other things and be like wow that is they did a really
[18:50.160 --> 18:53.920]  good job other times you'd be like ah they they uh you know we we did them one
[18:53.920 --> 18:55.920]  better but then at mac world what they would
[18:55.920 --> 18:58.480]  really do is they would have these ambitions to do like
[18:58.480 --> 19:03.600]  uh like new york uh new york magazine industry kind of stories bigger picture
[19:03.600 --> 19:07.760]  stories and big features and big ideas and some of those were uh real successes
[19:07.760 --> 19:11.600]  for them and some of those were uh i would say failures that were kind of
[19:11.600 --> 19:14.960]  the hubris of like you know yeah we're mac world but really we
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.240]  might as well be vanity fair and i think that was a part of their
[19:18.240 --> 19:22.480]  their culture there where mac world mac world was that and mac user
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.160]  was more um you know apple people who were there
[19:26.160 --> 19:28.160]  because they loved writing about technology
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.600]  and this is you know not entirely true of both staffs but
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.360]  i would say predominantly there were many more people who loved magazines and
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.000]  were writing at a technology magazine because
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.840]  that was the job at mac world and there were more people who were there
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.200]  because they loved the technology and happened to get a job writing about it
[19:45.200 --> 19:49.280]  at a magazine at mac user we were more and and you saw it in the end the people
[19:49.280 --> 19:52.320]  who stuck around covering apple afterward and writing about tech
[19:52.320 --> 19:55.760]  afterward were mostly people from mac user and not from mac world
[19:55.760 --> 19:59.040]  yeah the people from mac world who i remember who've obviously gone on to you
[19:59.040 --> 20:03.680]  know continued to do great work uh pogue pogue was a back page columnist
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.480]  and steven steven levy was um both of which were not on staff they
[20:08.480 --> 20:12.160]  were they were freelance columnists but yeah absolutely did a lot
[20:12.160 --> 20:15.280]  of the back page columns which i you know was yeah always what i
[20:15.280 --> 20:18.560]  aspire to be i got to edit pogue for a while and that was that was great he
[20:18.560 --> 20:20.720]  wrote features for us and he wrote the back page
[20:20.720 --> 20:24.080]  and um and he was a pleasure to work with and i still you know i still keep
[20:24.080 --> 20:27.280]  in touch with him it was a it was a pleasure to work with pogue
[20:27.280 --> 20:31.040]  my plan was always to figure out a way that i could get to that back page
[20:31.040 --> 20:35.440]  without having to do any of the grunt work of being a regular editorial
[20:35.440 --> 20:38.800]  staffer for years beforehand well man accomplished and mission
[20:38.800 --> 20:42.880]  accomplished i i wound up figuring out just such a way
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.160]  um and i think i would say this and too that the
[20:46.160 --> 20:51.600]  the person who to me best exemplified the mac user side of that split in that
[20:51.600 --> 20:56.240]  era was the fact that andy in atko was on was a mac user writer at
[20:56.240 --> 20:58.880]  the time and you know let's talk about another guy
[20:58.880 --> 21:02.400]  who's you know never been you know still at the top of
[21:02.400 --> 21:06.080]  his game now and still writing about the same stuff
[21:06.080 --> 21:10.800]  but the way that his his writing is so infused with his personal style
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.200]  right right uh was very very mac user you know that we're just gonna let
[21:15.200 --> 21:18.320]  we've got this nut on our staff and we're just gonna let him fly
[21:18.320 --> 21:22.000]  well i mean the mac user was it was andy and chris breen
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.280]  and bob levitas and i mean these are people who write with personality
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.600]  and that was definitely uh the idea and when i got to mac world
[21:31.600 --> 21:34.800]  um that was one of the things that surprised me is that there was a
[21:34.800 --> 21:38.000]  a statement that they valued their writers that i heard a lot but
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.040]  it did seem to me that it was also a machine kind of
[21:41.040 --> 21:47.200]  generating um a consistent copy and what you do when you generate
[21:47.200 --> 21:50.000]  consistent copy is you also stamp out voice and i would say that
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.240]  mac world was much tighter on that front but also had less voice and that user
[21:54.240 --> 21:57.840]  was definitely messier it was it was you know i i would say in
[21:57.840 --> 22:00.080]  fact you go back and look at old mac user stuff and
[22:00.080 --> 22:04.080]  it you tell me which which mac user mac world which one would seem more
[22:04.080 --> 22:07.440]  reasonable on a blog today it's very clear mac user was in that style they
[22:07.440 --> 22:10.160]  were they were much looser and had more voice
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.880]  than mac world did uh i remember arguing on on with
[22:14.880 --> 22:18.720]  fellow editorial staffers on my college newspaper at drexel
[22:18.720 --> 22:24.880]  and you know this would be 94 95 96 about which was better and the two other
[22:24.880 --> 22:28.000]  guys who really were were really you know both into
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.520]  writing over pursuing careers and writing or thinking about it at least
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.560]  and were mac nerds and read both magazines monthly the other two guys
[22:34.560 --> 22:37.360]  adam and andrew were both on them oh come on mac
[22:37.360 --> 22:41.360]  world's the better magazine um because i think that they were
[22:41.360 --> 22:44.720]  looking at that you know like you said like it's a little bit more like it's a
[22:44.720 --> 22:48.960]  magazine magazine yeah it's polished and and yeah well mac user was always very
[22:48.960 --> 22:52.960]  polished it didn't lack polish but it it to me my argument remember my argument
[22:52.960 --> 22:55.920]  was it just seems to me like the people at mac user are having
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.080]  more fun doing they're having more fun putting these issues out and i was like
[23:00.080 --> 23:02.000]  why why would you want to get into this if
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.440]  it wasn't to have fun well that was a great i mean i still stay in touch with
[23:05.440 --> 23:08.720]  those people from mac user and i i don't know i assume that the mac world people
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.960]  stay in touch too i really can't speak to that side but
[23:10.960 --> 23:14.160]  we were yeah it was a great it was a great group of people and
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.240]  um and that was and yeah we were very proud of our product i would say that
[23:18.240 --> 23:24.960]  it it was um less polished only in in calculated ways like you wanted to look
[23:24.960 --> 23:28.160]  a little wackier and and and be a little messier
[23:28.160 --> 23:31.040]  because that shows the personality but it was not
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.160]  like we didn't know what we were doing it was like you know let's
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.400]  that was what we were trying to do it's like a a band making an album that
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.440]  sounds raw and not super produced it's because you
[23:41.440 --> 23:44.240]  want it to that's the effect that you want and
[23:44.240 --> 23:46.960]  and honestly if you're if you're the number two
[23:46.960 --> 23:50.160]  then you you don't want to pretend to be number one you want to do something
[23:50.160 --> 23:53.680]  different and mac user was very definitely number two to mac world so
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.640]  that was what we did um and uh yeah it's it's just funny that in the end
[23:58.640 --> 24:02.240]  um in the end i spent 17 years at mac world but if you'd asked me the first
[24:02.240 --> 24:04.960]  three years i was working in the business i'd be like oh mac world i hate
[24:04.960 --> 24:08.240]  those guys and and it ends up being the brand that
[24:08.240 --> 24:12.640]  i'm most associated with in my career which is just crazy and every now and
[24:12.640 --> 24:16.000]  then on twitter i get there are two things i get like
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.880]  it's like there's an alarm that goes off every three months or so somebody sends
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.640]  me a thing saying is this you at the uh at the ipod
[24:22.640 --> 24:25.520]  announcement event because there is a reverse shot of the audience a couple of
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.040]  times and i'm in it i'm totally yes it is me um
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.120]  and the other one that pops up is hey i was watching this rerun of friends
[24:33.120 --> 24:37.200]  and there's and chandler is reading an issue of mac world
[24:37.200 --> 24:40.560]  and i thought you know and they think of me and they're like oh isn't this cool
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.120]  that mac world wasn't friends and i appreciate that because they're
[24:43.120 --> 24:45.920]  thinking of me in connection with the brand that's great
[24:45.920 --> 24:49.680]  um i was a mac user when that episode aired and i was so pissed off
[24:49.680 --> 24:53.440]  it's like god damn it why is it mac world right now
[24:53.440 --> 24:56.880]  chandler would have been a mac user guy yeah i know yeah could he be more of a
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.880]  mac user guy but in the end now i like i love it because it's like yeah there's
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.640]  a mac magazine and friends that's great that and then it would be that that guy
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.080]  would read computer magazine that was shorthand for what kind of a nerd he was
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.800]  and that's great but uh it's funny because that's how far
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.040]  i've come around now is at the time it was just
[25:13.040 --> 25:16.560]  infuriating because our arch enemy got on
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.880]  must see tv on nbc and now i look back and it's like yay look mac world on
[25:20.880 --> 25:23.360]  friends that's great it's just it's you know that's what
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.000]  happens i end up spending 17 years at what was
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.600]  originally the arch enemy i imagine that it's not to use another baseball
[25:29.600 --> 25:32.800]  metaphor but i imagine that's what it's like if you like grew up a giants fan
[25:32.800 --> 25:35.760]  and then you end up getting drafted by the dodgers and play for the dodgers
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.760]  it's like well you know now i'm a dodger that's just how it is i grew up a
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.200]  giant span that's great but i'm not there anymore i'm i'm here or if it's
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.480]  your son or something you know totally right where it just changes your
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.840]  perception after all right it's like who gives a crap you know you
[25:49.840 --> 25:52.480]  know if your son is playing for the red sox boy you're you know
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.000]  next day you're going out you're buying a lot of red sox yeah absolutely
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.720]  yeah uh and then before uh before we leave the subject the last
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.560]  thing i wanted to touch on though is that all right apple terrible shape 96
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.560]  97 print industry as a whole
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.000]  almost unspeakably high yeah at at that time like you can't and
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.880]  you think in hindsight well how could that be because the
[26:16.880 --> 26:20.000]  i think in hindsight we can all see the writing was on the wall
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.120]  that um newspaper and magazine publishers didn't get the internet
[26:27.120 --> 26:30.320]  still don't to a large extent and that it
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.240]  even if they did that it the way that it was going to affect
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.400]  advertising revenue and the time that people spend reading and how they spend
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.760]  reading it was all going to be massively disrupted
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.720]  and you'd think by 97 98 that that would have been evident but it
[26:46.720 --> 26:49.920]  wasn't because profits were at an all-time high
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.120]  and i say this to someone who was at the time working on the
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.600]  as a graphic designer at the philadelphia inquirer
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.800]  it all they had the money was i mean that was where all the advertising was
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.360]  there was no there was momentum on the internet people
[27:03.360 --> 27:06.000]  were getting interested in it but there was no money on the internet that would
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.560]  be crazy and i you know i had somebody tell me we're
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.440]  not interested in even doing a web page because the future is on copyserv i mean
[27:11.440 --> 27:14.000]  it was just they were not there was so much money in print
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.160]  advertising that like computer shopper which was also a ziff davis property when
[27:18.160 --> 27:20.240]  i was at ziff davis that was like a phone book that came
[27:20.240 --> 27:22.880]  out every month and all it was was ads there was
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.560]  enough editorial to allow them to use the editorial rate when they shipped it
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.000]  in the in the post postal service but it was it was
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.480]  not meant as an editorial product it was a catalog
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.600]  and that was just literally we just made a thing so you could put your ads in
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.120]  this thing and then we'll send it out that was that was the world then and the
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.160]  reason why was because the only way that as somebody who is going to be buying
[27:44.160 --> 27:51.120]  external hard drives or scuzzy cables or uh printer cartridges or
[27:51.120 --> 27:57.280]  all of the various crap that you needed to buy to keep your office running
[27:57.280 --> 28:00.560]  you needed something like computer shopper so that you
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.600]  could see what was available and what it cost
[28:03.600 --> 28:07.520]  yeah that was how you shopped for stuff i mean when i
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.600]  right when uh the macworld thing happened and i was going to xoxo
[28:11.600 --> 28:14.480]  um neil a patel from the verge sent me an email and said would you like to
[28:14.480 --> 28:17.040]  write a write a thing we're scanning in a bunch of old macworld covers would you
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.840]  like to write a thing about the the end of macworld in print and i said
[28:19.840 --> 28:22.960]  sure and that was that was what i ended up going with because i thought okay the
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.240]  verge's audience is pretty young they may not even remember
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.840]  computer magazines as anything but kind of an oddity you see in a in an airport
[28:29.840 --> 28:32.160]  or something and and that was the point i made was
[28:32.160 --> 28:35.680]  there was a time when the only way you found out about a new product
[28:35.680 --> 28:39.920]  and the only way you found like what you could buy was by buying a computer
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.680]  magazine so like the computer magazine would
[28:41.680 --> 28:44.480]  come out and you would you would pour over the pages
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.840]  to find out what apple announced or what microsoft announced or whatever you were
[28:47.840 --> 28:49.760]  interested in and then in the back you would leaf
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.520]  through and be like uh you know what monitor should i get or what cable can i
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.840]  get and you know there's an ad here for you know
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.560]  1 800 max and here's mac warehouse over here and club mac over there and you
[29:00.560 --> 29:03.680]  you'd pour over that stuff and i did that i mean i would go through those
[29:03.680 --> 29:06.880]  issues 10 20 times parsing every sentence about
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.320]  which power book i wanted to buy and parsing every list of products in
[29:12.320 --> 29:15.360]  the different back of the magazine catalogs for the
[29:15.360 --> 29:19.120]  best you know the best deal on some accessory and then you'd call an 800
[29:19.120 --> 29:21.120]  number and give them your credit card and
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.080]  they'd ship it to you and you'd get it like five days later that was the way
[29:24.080 --> 29:26.800]  the the tech world worked and you know now
[29:26.800 --> 29:28.560]  it's really different but back then that was
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.480]  that magazine was not the only but almost the only conduit for that
[29:32.480 --> 29:35.280]  information yeah people just did not see that
[29:35.280 --> 29:37.200]  disruption coming and then the equivalent for
[29:37.200 --> 29:40.480]  newspapers was classified ads where anything
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.240]  you needed to buy like you need to rent it you've got to rent a new apartment
[29:44.240 --> 29:46.960]  you know your roommate your roommates are moving out of town
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.720]  and by september you've got to find a new place to live well the only way to
[29:50.720 --> 29:54.640]  do it was to to use a newspaper there was i mean
[29:54.640 --> 29:57.120]  there wasn't there was no plan b yeah it was it was
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.440]  essentially a monopoly just because of the
[29:59.440 --> 30:02.560]  you know that they were the only ones maybe there's a an alt weekly
[30:02.560 --> 30:06.720]  i will say the one thing that i i think was a sign in hindsight of the magazine
[30:06.720 --> 30:11.280]  stuff falling apart was all of those catalogs started printing
[30:11.280 --> 30:14.400]  you know they started doing all their money into catalogs
[30:14.400 --> 30:16.960]  it's like we were going to print a catalog all the mail order companies
[30:16.960 --> 30:22.000]  just became catalogs and they they took the hit on postage
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.800]  although i in hindsight i also think they should have just hired a couple of
[30:24.800 --> 30:28.480]  young editors to wrap enough content around it to call it a magazine mac
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.720]  warehouse magazine but that and that actually really put
[30:32.720 --> 30:35.680]  that was the first time i think that those computer magazines
[30:35.680 --> 30:41.120]  really felt the pain of of their ad revenues going down was the
[30:41.120 --> 30:45.920]  catalogs were like a guaranteed uh seller for them and then suddenly
[30:45.920 --> 30:48.800]  they would pull out and go back down to a couple of pages because
[30:48.800 --> 30:52.000]  you know they would they would rent the list from macworld
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.920]  and then send everybody who gets macworld a catalog and that was cheaper
[30:55.920 --> 30:59.040]  and that was less money for macworld and that totally happened so that there were
[30:59.040 --> 31:01.760]  some signs right that things were starting to break apart
[31:01.760 --> 31:05.120]  um and the computer readers are always going to be the first one to embrace
[31:05.120 --> 31:07.840]  that new technology so i always knew that they would be the
[31:07.840 --> 31:10.880]  ones to uh we would we would feel at first
[31:10.880 --> 31:15.200]  and we and we totally did yeah yeah and it's you know it's the same
[31:15.200 --> 31:20.160]  reason why 10 well probably more like 15 years ago
[31:20.160 --> 31:23.840]  when when blogs first started percolating up and
[31:23.840 --> 31:27.600]  becoming a thing that so many of them were technology
[31:27.600 --> 31:31.360]  focused i mean just an unbelievably disproportionate
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.680]  number of them were technology focused compared to the interests of
[31:35.680 --> 31:38.880]  the world at large because it's the people who
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.720]  are enthusiastic about technology who were able to
[31:42.720 --> 31:45.920]  get it up and you know get a blog up and running and keep it running and that's
[31:45.920 --> 31:50.480]  the story of my life which is i i had a nice job at a at a tech publisher
[31:50.480 --> 31:53.200]  and so when i wanted to experiment with blogs i couldn't really write about
[31:53.200 --> 31:55.040]  technology because that was my day job so
[31:55.040 --> 31:57.920]  you know all those great tech blogs being founded then and i did a like a
[31:57.920 --> 32:01.120]  stupid tv blog which was great and it was early in the days of
[32:01.120 --> 32:04.480]  of blogging and i learned a lot but that was one of those funny things that i
[32:04.480 --> 32:08.160]  ended up experimenting in all of these other areas because my employer wasn't
[32:08.160 --> 32:12.080]  that interested in experimenting in those areas
[32:12.080 --> 32:15.840]  that's you know that's why i do so many side projects is because for years
[32:15.840 --> 32:19.120]  my employer wasn't interested in trying those things out they were they were
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.080]  looking at where all the money was coming from which is that that's the
[32:22.080 --> 32:25.520]  core of the innovator's dilemma right it's very hard to focus on something
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.200]  when there is this giant sack of money right in front of you
[32:29.200 --> 32:32.960]  let me take a break and thank um first sponsor on this show
[32:32.960 --> 32:39.360]  and it is our good friends at backplace now you guys know backplace online
[32:39.360 --> 32:45.440]  unthrottled unlimited backup for the mac and people write to me sometimes because
[32:45.440 --> 32:47.840]  there's frequent sponsor and they say unlimited what do you mean
[32:47.840 --> 32:51.040]  and it i'm telling you whatever you've got connected to your mac
[32:51.040 --> 32:54.640]  if you've got a three terabyte drive you've got a six terabyte drive and it's
[32:54.640 --> 32:58.560]  all filled up with junk backblaze will back it all up doesn't
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.200]  matter they don't charge extra if you have more
[33:01.200 --> 33:04.960]  it just takes longer for the initial backup that's if there's a catch
[33:04.960 --> 33:08.080]  that's it that if you've got six terabytes of stuff to back up well it's
[33:08.080 --> 33:10.960]  going to take a long time to get it backed up once it's backed up
[33:10.960 --> 33:14.800]  it's backed up and then it's just everything else is
[33:14.800 --> 33:19.360]  you know incremental after that you just install backplace
[33:19.360 --> 33:22.720]  on your mac i can't emphasize how simple this is you install it
[33:22.720 --> 33:26.160]  you sign up for an account you don't even have to pay for a month
[33:26.160 --> 33:30.400]  it's free it's just try it out everything gets backed up
[33:30.400 --> 33:33.360]  and then what do you do from that point forward to stay backed up nothing you
[33:33.360 --> 33:36.320]  just keep your mac running and it runs silently in the background
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.840]  and every once in a while it just uploads what's new
[33:39.840 --> 33:43.120]  keeps everything in sync they've got an iphone app
[33:43.120 --> 33:46.560]  so that you can access your account which will get you access to anything
[33:46.560 --> 33:49.680]  any of your files that are backed up in backplace you can just grab them
[33:49.680 --> 33:53.760]  from the iphone app at any time email them right there from your iphone or
[33:53.760 --> 33:58.000]  whatever when you're away from your mac so it's got plenty of uses that are not
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.800]  just about catastrophic oh my god my whole
[34:00.800 --> 34:04.160]  computer is broken the whole hard drive froze up
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.960]  i've got nothing i need to restore everything they can deal with that
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.480]  but it's also useful for just restoring one file at a time
[34:12.480 --> 34:16.080]  when you're on the road at somewhere else and you just need to grab it
[34:16.080 --> 34:19.840]  could not be more useful either way when you do need a full thing if you need
[34:19.840 --> 34:22.640]  your whole system restored you don't have to wait to download
[34:22.640 --> 34:26.000]  the whole thing you can you can pay a little bit of money and they'll put
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.080]  everything on a usb hard drive and overnight it to
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.240]  you and then boom there you are the next day
[34:32.240 --> 34:37.360]  with a hard drive with all of your stuff unbelievable peace of mind knowing that
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.200]  you've got everything backed up offline out of your house out of your
[34:41.200 --> 34:46.240]  office um where do you go to find out more
[34:46.240 --> 34:49.120]  i can't believe there's still people who listen to the show who haven't signed up
[34:49.120 --> 34:52.160]  but here's where you go go to backblaze.com
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.320]  slash daring fireball you get a risk-free no credit card required trial just
[34:58.320 --> 35:01.040]  install it try it guarantee you you'll sign up and

[35:02.960 --> 35:06.720]  five bucks a month per mac that you're backing up
[35:06.720 --> 35:10.480]  that's it five bucks a month everything backed up
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.520]  so my thanks to backblaze um just a tremendous tremendous service really i
[35:15.520 --> 35:18.800]  say that before i say it again i hope they stop sponsoring the show because
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.760]  everybody who listens to the show signs up for them at some point
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.800]  uh which brings me to a post you had on uh
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.760]  six uh six colors this week about uh a sponsorship that didn't go well
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.000]  yeah it was like a what'd you say no other gatekeeper but me
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.600]  and you wrote that one of the privileges of being an editor
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.040]  that before you didn't really have to worry about it that there really was a
[35:47.040 --> 35:51.040]  separation between editorial and sales you know that you just worried about you
[35:51.040 --> 35:53.840]  guys on the editorial side just worried about what you're going to write about
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.200]  and you had a sales staff that sold stuff and you know in theory it sold ads
[35:57.200 --> 35:59.680]  and in theory they could have sold an ad that you guys
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.000]  were you know some somehow uncomfortable with and you could have had a discussion
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.480]  or whatever but for the most part you didn't need to worry about it
[36:06.480 --> 36:12.800]  but now as a one-person publishing company you do yeah
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.440]  there was it turns out there is a great luxury in being able to be an editor at
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.040]  a large organization and when some ad that
[36:21.040 --> 36:24.320]  is selling i mean like at macworld we had a bunch of like
[36:24.320 --> 36:29.680]  dvd ripper apps that were um you know spamming our forums and writing
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.360]  these fake posts native ad posts about that were posing
[36:33.360 --> 36:36.400]  as how-tos but it was for their software and just really awful junkies
[36:36.400 --> 36:38.560]  stuff and we had the luxury i mean behind the
[36:38.560 --> 36:41.360]  scenes we would complain about it but we also had the luxury of saying hey guys
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.840]  it's not us you know we have sales people they don't
[36:43.840 --> 36:46.560]  tell us what to write and we don't tell them what ads to sell
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.840]  and um when you're in my position and your position i mean you've got
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.600]  um right now i don't have anybody selling spots for me
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.840]  um but that might happen uh down the road let me my recording died
[37:01.840 --> 37:04.720]  let me but i know you've got somebody selling
[37:04.720 --> 37:08.080]  selling but it's still a small operation it's like you you got you and maybe
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.880]  dave uh working on on ad sales and and you
[37:10.880 --> 37:13.440]  know it comes to you you're the proprietor even if you've got somebody
[37:13.440 --> 37:16.240]  selling for you and with podcasts it's like this when i
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.720]  have somebody selling an ad in my podcast or you do in yours
[37:18.720 --> 37:22.400]  you've got um you're the proprietor even if you've got somebody selling it and
[37:22.400 --> 37:24.800]  you have to make that decision you have to say
[37:24.800 --> 37:30.400]  um yeah this ad is okay and and and so even if it's not you know
[37:30.400 --> 37:34.480]  every ad is not a personal endorsement and you can't i had somebody say that to
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.800]  me and i wrote about it in that post it's like
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.560]  i don't i'm not a developer but i know i can look at a developer
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.400]  service or tool and say that seems good to me that seems on the up and up it's
[37:44.400 --> 37:48.400]  it fits with the audience yeah you can't have it you can't have it like i know
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.000]  in theory it sounds great that you would only take a sponsorship from a service
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.040]  or product that you actually use and the deck for a while
[37:57.040 --> 38:00.640]  maybe they still even say that but then at with the deck it's a big
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.640]  30 site network and it's not that hard to say that somebody somewhere in the
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.640]  network is using the thing right um but when it's just you and it's
[38:08.640 --> 38:12.560]  just me i can't do that no and and it's not even fair like i use
[38:12.560 --> 38:15.600]  bb edit i have to code something up i use bb edit
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.960]  yeah but would i accept a sponsorship from coda
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.080]  of course i would coda is an amazing app from
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.320]  a great company and in theory i maybe someday i would use it
[38:26.320 --> 38:29.520]  you know i mean that's to me is my criteria is is this something that i
[38:29.520 --> 38:34.720]  would recommend because i use it that that criteria isn't it's too limiting is
[38:34.720 --> 38:37.040]  this something that i would recommend readers
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.480]  investigate and consider yes right absolutely
[38:40.480 --> 38:43.520]  that's right criteria and it has to cross it has to cross that level and
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.960]  that's harder to define but it it has to cross that level um to be
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.840]  something you feel comfortable i mean on one level it's just to be comfortable
[38:51.840 --> 38:54.320]  with it and say i think this is a legitimate
[38:54.320 --> 38:56.800]  product and all that and again i don't want to throw the guys under the bus who
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.000]  did that sponsorship but the fact that and they have a story and i think part
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.400]  of their problem is there's a language barrier and
[39:02.400 --> 39:05.680]  although i'm skeptical of that product and you know it's an antivirus product
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.360]  and it included an ios component everybody's like whoa ios antivirus that
[39:09.360 --> 39:12.240]  seems really shady to me and they have you know again they have
[39:12.240 --> 39:14.960]  a marketing story that i think they're not telling effectively
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.200]  but the bottom line was i don't believe in ios antivirus i don't think that's a
[39:19.200 --> 39:21.120]  thing and i don't think i think my audience
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.400]  doesn't think that's a thing and i'm skeptical about mac antivirus but at
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.680]  least i'm a little more open-minded about that than i am about ios and
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.520]  and so when when i posted this thing which you know i didn't i didn't read
[39:31.520 --> 39:34.480]  the stuff closely when i got it because i was traveling and then i put it up and
[39:34.480 --> 39:37.840]  like before as i was going out the door um
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.280]  and then people started saying what the hell is this and i i you know
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.120]  i didn't have an an answer for them and that was that moment i'm like oh you
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.760]  know if i don't if i can't conceive of somebody asking me
[39:49.760 --> 39:52.400]  and me having an answer that's probably not a
[39:52.400 --> 39:55.360]  product i should if i'm not comfortable standing by it to that point not saying
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.200]  i tried it and i like it but i think this is a reasonable reasonable
[39:59.200 --> 40:02.960]  person would think that this product is interesting and you should check it out
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.720]  um that that to me it would be the difference and so
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.560]  you know while sitting in the passenger seat of my car i didn't this all blew up
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.680]  while i i drove the first leg and my wife drove the second leg and i
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.080]  opened up my phone i'm like oh geez and in the course of about an hour i
[40:18.080 --> 40:24.160]  responded to uh the the tweets about it um looked more at the at at the the
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.480]  company's responses um thought about it a little bit and then
[40:28.480 --> 40:31.440]  i actually opened up you know i opened up transmit for ios
[40:31.440 --> 40:34.480]  and edited the include file for the sponsor on my server and i took it out
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.920]  and i deleted their post and i posted a tweet about it and i sent
[40:37.920 --> 40:40.880]  an email to the guy saying look i'm gonna you know i'll refund your money
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.200]  but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna run the the ad because i'm
[40:43.200 --> 40:45.760]  not comfortable with it my audience isn't comfortable with it
[40:45.760 --> 40:49.440]  and i actually got a text from lex friedman saying
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.440]  um what what if i uh what if i sell that spot for you
[40:53.440 --> 40:56.640]  and i said sure go ahead if you want to sell it and he did
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.960]  and i posted the new ad all all from sitting in the passenger seat of my car
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.240]  on my iphone which is a pretty fun like technology story but um but yeah it
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.040]  was uh it was educational because i
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.560]  couldn't run and hide behind the sales people it you know and you're
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.920]  you're in the exact same boat and jim dow rimbles in the same boat and
[41:15.920 --> 41:19.760]  you know all of us who are out here doing this thing we aren't
[41:19.760 --> 41:22.960]  we aren't insulated like that and so we have to make different rules and and
[41:22.960 --> 41:26.320]  there is an expectation that some people have that that when we read an ad
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.920]  you know on a podcast or or post a sponsor on our sites that that
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.760]  it's a personal endorsement and what i always say is if i have used the product
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.680]  i will and and i want to talk about that i will talk about it
[41:37.680 --> 41:41.120]  but you're not your money doesn't buy my personal endorsement my personal
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.320]  endorsement can't be for sale that's the flip side of the not only is
[41:44.320 --> 41:47.440]  it impractical to try every product and not every product is for you even though
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.880]  you know it's good the flip side is i want the freedom to
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.560]  evaluate every product that i want to and if i'm selling
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.920]  evaluations that calls the whole thing into question so you have to
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.560]  you know those rules are very different than if you're in a big editorial
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.160]  organization but you still have to kind of
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.000]  come up with the rules and try to disclose them to your audience as best
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.040]  you can i think but it was a good lesson for me i'll tell you that
[42:09.040 --> 42:15.280]  yeah antivirus it falls into an interesting crevice where
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.720]  it's a close call and and i would say that the
[42:18.720 --> 42:25.840]  the sibling to antivirus are system cleanup utilities oh yeah
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.400]  yeah yeah yeah um and
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.200]  i don't think i've ever taken a sponsorship for antivirus because i
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.960]  really do believe strongly that you you not only don't need it on a mac but
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.440]  that you actually it will call it typically cause more harm than good
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.240]  i really do believe that and you know for ios it's even more so i think it's
[42:50.240 --> 42:52.720]  at that point you're talking about snake oil
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.160]  um now there's possible you know i don't know you know like the case of the
[42:56.160 --> 42:59.760]  sponsor you're talking about i it's possible that you could use
[42:59.760 --> 43:02.640]  something on ios that would have something to do with
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.320]  antivirus where you're scanning email attachments somehow or something i think
[43:06.320 --> 43:09.040]  that's what they're doing is they're scanning attachments in your email and
[43:09.040 --> 43:11.120]  maybe on your drop box or stuff like that
[43:11.120 --> 43:14.880]  right for viruses but it's not going to affect your your ios device
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.480]  right it's not so hard for me to come up with a what-if scenario where it would
[43:18.480 --> 43:23.520]  have some actual practical utility in theory but i don't see how it you
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.120]  know yeah exactly it's not actually doing antivirus at the system level on
[43:27.120 --> 43:29.920]  ios like what you think of traditionally right and then you simplify the
[43:29.920 --> 43:33.840]  marketing message and it's protect your eye your iphone and that's not right and
[43:33.840 --> 43:36.240]  that's that's i think that's where a lot of this
[43:36.240 --> 43:39.600]  uh this comes from and the cleanup utilities
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.080]  are to me it's a little bit more like the antivirus to me is a little bit more
[43:44.080 --> 43:47.600]  on the dark side of the gray area and the cleanup utilities are a little bit
[43:47.600 --> 43:51.200]  more on the light side but i have i've have had sponsors who
[43:51.200 --> 43:54.800]  run you know cleanup utilities and i think
[43:54.800 --> 43:57.600]  it's been a while and i remember somebody on twitter one
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.280]  time just you know they weren't being antagonistic they weren't trying to
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.680]  to to jab me but it was an honest questionnaire like do you use this
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.200]  would you recommend it and i remember thinking like probably not
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.040]  and i kind of felt a little like i didn't take the sponsorship back and i
[44:13.040 --> 44:15.760]  don't quite regret it but it was the closest
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.200]  i've ever come because i'm just wasn't sure because i
[44:19.200 --> 44:22.400]  don't think a lot of that stuff is all that useful either i feel like
[44:22.400 --> 44:30.240]  part of the genius of the os 10 system design is that
[44:30.240 --> 44:34.160]  you don't typically get the system doesn't degrade over time
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.000]  which did happen with classic mac os and if you weren't careful
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.800]  right and certainly windows right definitely happens with windows they
[44:40.800 --> 44:43.920]  want a mac i mean so many of these things happen because it's like oh
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.200]  we have a windows product we have an android product we need apple products
[44:47.200 --> 44:50.560]  and they can't really do much but they want to have that
[44:50.560 --> 44:53.760]  that spread of products and so they come out with one although you know
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.840]  cleanup especially with ssd's there's totally and they may be out there but
[44:57.840 --> 44:59.920]  there's totally a good case to be made for cleanup
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.920]  that's doing smart things like you've got preferences from apps from 2004
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.520]  that you that you migrated and you've got duplicate files in all these
[45:07.520 --> 45:10.320]  different places and you've got itunes match turned on
[45:10.320 --> 45:13.840]  but like so i could save a lot of space by deleting
[45:13.840 --> 45:18.880]  your uh your music folder yeah stuff like that there is an argument to be
[45:18.880 --> 45:21.040]  made but you're right then you get in the details and you're
[45:21.040 --> 45:24.000]  like yeah do i really believe in this particular product enough
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.080]  to not enough to endorse it but enough to expose my audience to it
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.600]  because there is there is some understanding between
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.720]  between us and our audiences that uh some of the stuff is going to be you
[45:36.720 --> 45:39.280]  know vetted at least right it's on the up and up
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.640]  right not necessarily we endorse it and use it personally but it's on the up and
[45:42.640 --> 45:45.360]  up and i i think that's right i think that
[45:45.360 --> 45:49.280]  they should expect that from us the the the next
[45:49.280 --> 45:52.400]  it you know because it dates all the way back to next but that the the
[45:52.400 --> 45:58.880]  cocoa preferences system is so brain dead super simple it's you know it's
[45:58.880 --> 46:02.800]  not genius because it's this complicated genius system it's
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.200]  genius because it is just simple it's like one of the
[46:07.200 --> 46:12.000]  simplest stupidest things they could do where each app has a unique identifier
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.200]  and they just use domain names so like you know like bare bones is com dot
[46:17.200 --> 46:23.440]  uh bare bones dot bb edit yeah dot p list and that file goes in
[46:23.440 --> 46:27.440]  your library preferences folder and it's guaranteed to be unique because that
[46:27.440 --> 46:30.320]  domain name belongs to bare bones so they get to control that
[46:30.320 --> 46:33.680]  you know there's com dot apple dot mail for mail
[46:33.680 --> 46:38.000]  and it's just a file and the app reads from that file
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.400]  and that's where your preferences are stored and if you delete bb edit
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.680]  and that com dot bare bones dot you delete the app
[46:45.680 --> 46:48.960]  that file is sitting there it's only a couple hundred kilobytes
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.640]  and it never gets in the way it's not like a database that's getting gummed up
[46:52.640 --> 46:55.760]  it's just a file that's in the folder and you're at
[46:55.760 --> 46:59.120]  you know there is no harm so if you've tried
[46:59.120 --> 47:02.320]  50 different text editors and then settled on one
[47:02.320 --> 47:05.360]  those 49 preferences files in your preferences folder
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.120]  don't slow a damn thing down no it's going to be when you've got adobe cs4
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.880]  and cs5 and cs6 in there or on the other hand like
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.400]  something like well i never use garage band so i'll delete the garage band app
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.080]  well garage band has like a 400 mega loops and
[47:20.080 --> 47:24.000]  loops and instruments are enormous there's yeah there's so there's like a
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.640]  huge application support folder relatively huge compared to most apps
[47:28.640 --> 47:31.680]  that you know and again if you're on an ssd and space
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.360]  is at a premium because you know like the default ssd is
[47:35.360 --> 47:41.520]  still like 256 gigabytes you could save some serious space and
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.680]  it's hidden away now that the library folder is invisible
[47:45.680 --> 47:52.720]  by default for most you know for for new user accounts it's not something you
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.560]  know i can see how a cleaning utility could actually help like a typical user
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.600]  if it was carefully written and you know but it's a borderline call
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.520]  can i tell you about my favorite uh my favorite preference
[48:05.520 --> 48:11.440]  uh joke um adobe of course is the is the answer there
[48:11.440 --> 48:13.600]  is in my and maybe in yours too i don't know
[48:13.600 --> 48:19.520]  in my user library folder so tilde slash library there's a folder there's the
[48:19.520 --> 48:21.920]  application support folder right which is where you're supposed to write all
[48:21.920 --> 48:24.880]  your folders or write your preference files
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.240]  i also have a folder in my library called
[48:28.240 --> 48:31.680]  application support slash adobe slash acrobat
[48:31.680 --> 48:34.880]  that's the name of the folder
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.360]  i don't have that i don't even know i didn't even know that was allowed
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.520]  to have slashes in a in a folder name but somehow they did it
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.720]  you magnificent bastards you did it and i just it makes me i want to delete
[48:48.720 --> 48:51.120]  it and yet every time i see it it just makes me laugh
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.760]  it's like how incompetent is that yeah yeah good job you're in the
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.840]  application support folder totally nailed it i'll send you a screenshot
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.520]  it's it's super nerdy
[49:06.400 --> 49:14.800]  but that was actually when when the next acquisition was made and
[49:17.200 --> 49:20.240]  and they were going to do this well we're going to we're going to make one
[49:20.240 --> 49:23.680]  operating system with the best of everything one of the problems was next
[49:23.680 --> 49:26.320]  was a traditional unix system that used slash
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.560]  as the directory um separator so slash was not again well
[49:32.560 --> 49:35.440]  maybe you could do with a backslash but you know slash was something that you
[49:35.440 --> 49:39.520]  couldn't put into a you know file name or folder name right
[49:39.520 --> 49:42.080]  you try to type it and it would give you a minus or something
[49:42.080 --> 49:49.280]  right but hfs the apple uh disk format what would you call it
[49:49.280 --> 49:52.960]  where's syracuse when you need them well whatever the hfs
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.560]  used file system file system used uh colon
[49:56.560 --> 49:59.680]  colon was the separator so you couldn't type a colon in the name
[49:59.680 --> 50:03.680]  so you could type slashes and so also you know like a publication
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.040]  you might for each issue of a newspaper you
[50:07.040 --> 50:10.480]  you know like a weekly newspaper i i think maybe we did
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.080]  you know we did this in that world yeah yeah it would be like
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.600]  you know month slash we are you know month or year slash month
[50:19.600 --> 50:22.080]  slash date you know and that would be it and so
[50:22.080 --> 50:28.480]  we had all these things that had um uh slashes in the actual file names and
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.200]  there was and it just seemed like well something's
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.600]  got to give here but there was a white paper
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.760]  um oh god i forget who wrote it but i i met him
[50:37.760 --> 50:41.280]  uh there's an x engineer who wrote a white paper figuring out a way to
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.320]  conveniently solve it and the bottom line me you know the bottom line is the
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.520]  the penalty we had to pay is that you can't have a colon or a
[50:49.520 --> 50:54.240]  slash in a file name now for real but you can it looks like you
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.920]  have a slash in the file name it it somehow is fake like when it looks
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.920]  like you have a slash on a file name it's not a slash
[51:03.920 --> 51:07.760]  i love it but it all worked out it actually did work out
[51:07.760 --> 51:10.960]  we had we had that we had a catastrophe where we we
[51:10.960 --> 51:14.800]  we did that we at some point at macworld changed our file name format it used to
[51:14.800 --> 51:17.760]  be um you know the volume number and the
[51:17.760 --> 51:23.440]  issue number so it'd be like 16 slash 04 and that was the whatever that was
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.960]  april of uh what's 84 plus 16 right april 2000
[51:28.960 --> 51:34.720]  um issue and uh when os 10 happened we we moved them all to dashes because we
[51:34.720 --> 51:37.040]  were afraid because there was a period where os 10
[51:37.040 --> 51:39.840]  would not let you input the slash you it would it would
[51:39.840 --> 51:43.120]  transmogrify it on the fly to a dash because
[51:43.120 --> 51:47.360]  dashes were dangerous and to this day my apple scripts i have to do a lot of you
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.160]  know posix path stuff because uh if you get if you get
[51:52.160 --> 51:54.800]  an alias in the finder it comes in with colon
[51:54.800 --> 51:58.080]  delimited and uh then there are other tools that
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.800]  wanted as a as a as a unix path a posix path and you have to do like posix pass
[52:02.800 --> 52:07.200]  path of alias in order to get it in the right format so that you can
[52:07.200 --> 52:10.400]  you can send it to a script or something yeah i don't think anybody
[52:10.400 --> 52:16.880]  is uh is more familiar with the crazy rules over how to specify
[52:16.880 --> 52:21.600]  hfs versus unix style pass than anybody who's written any apple script
[52:21.600 --> 52:25.360]  it's like why is this not working and you're like oh right now it needs to be
[52:25.360 --> 52:28.720]  a unix path or because inevitably with
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.120]  apple script boy we are in the weeds now um you uh you
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.680]  use do shell script which is an incredible
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.760]  boon to apple script to be able to just basically fire off a unix script and get
[52:39.760 --> 52:43.440]  a result back it's great um but if you're using
[52:43.440 --> 52:47.440]  something a file you got in the finder unix shell script doesn't understand
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.040]  those colons so you need to convert it and then you send it off and so that
[52:51.040 --> 52:55.600]  yeah i i i that happens all the time
[52:56.880 --> 53:00.400]  we are definitely off in the weeds yeah yeah i do that with markdown actually
[53:00.400 --> 53:02.400]  that that was one of the things i would always do is
[53:02.400 --> 53:05.280]  i'd like grab something and run it through markdown and get the results
[53:05.280 --> 53:08.720]  back and all that you gotta get the you gotta get the file names right so
[53:08.720 --> 53:13.520]  where were we talking about before we went off on the file system oh
[53:13.520 --> 53:18.560]  oh wow old days you next you were talking about next engineers god what
[53:18.560 --> 53:21.600]  was it we have to back up a little sponsors
[53:21.600 --> 53:24.240]  sponsored conflicts i think that's where we were yeah i
[53:24.240 --> 53:28.080]  think that's probably it i remember in the early days of doing
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.040]  um
[53:32.480 --> 53:38.000]  sponsorships at daring fireball weekly ones that i was selling myself the
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.080]  first conflict i can remember having was and this was at the time do you remember
[53:42.080 --> 53:45.040]  for a brief period there was some controversy over
[53:45.040 --> 53:48.240]  app bundles oh yeah yeah yeah oh definitely
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.720]  you know like uh those you would oh a mac heist and all of that yeah like a
[53:52.720 --> 53:57.600]  mac yeah and all those yeah mac heist and i had come out sort of against them
[53:57.600 --> 54:01.680]  as sort of devaluing software at least the extreme ones where you're getting
[54:01.680 --> 54:05.840]  you know an inordinate amount of software for a seemingly absurd low
[54:05.840 --> 54:09.920]  price and then a bundle wanted to sponsor
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.720]  during fireball right and i i
[54:14.720 --> 54:17.680]  i don't know i was very i can't remember which bundle it was but i was very
[54:17.680 --> 54:20.720]  conflicted because i felt like on the one hand i've just
[54:20.720 --> 54:24.240]  written against them but on the other hand you know it's
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.080]  a good deal it is what it is you know and nobody you know it's not like the
[54:28.080 --> 54:30.800]  bundles were putting these apps into the bundles without
[54:30.800 --> 54:37.120]  their permission it was uh you know and and i think i wound up
[54:37.120 --> 54:39.840]  going with it i did it i took it because i thought you know
[54:39.840 --> 54:46.080]  it's it in some sense you
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.400]  you have to be the publisher you know every publication there never really was
[54:50.400 --> 54:53.760]  a wall between editorial and and advertising even in a big
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.680]  organization it might have seemed like a wall in the
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.280]  trenches yes yeah but eventually you work up the
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.720]  chain and there's a person whose responsibility you know typically
[55:04.720 --> 55:07.760]  their title was like publisher like certainly in the newspaper industry
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.960]  that was the title is somebody who is concerned with both things
[55:12.960 --> 55:15.680]  yeah and for me i mean that's what i always said about my job is that i sat
[55:15.680 --> 55:18.720]  on that i sat on the top of the wall and it's like i got to shield my people
[55:18.720 --> 55:21.600]  from the stuff that was happening on the other side of the wall as best i could
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.080]  but my boss was the president of the company
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.000]  and the head of say it was either the head of sales themselves or the head of
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.320]  sales reported to them and at that level you know there were
[55:32.320 --> 55:35.360]  always conversations now again my job was to
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.960]  kind of steer them in the right direction and protect my people from it
[55:38.960 --> 55:45.520]  but you know ultimately yes if you have um if you have a business the business
[55:45.520 --> 55:48.000]  people are going to have demands that they're going to want to make and then
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.640]  it becomes part of the game to negotiate and get things back in a in a
[55:52.640 --> 55:56.640]  place that everybody can live with that is not uh you know hinky for the
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.440]  editorial side that is that was always part of my job up at the
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.040]  top it's just harder when you you know what you're saying it's like now it's
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.120]  all exposed it's just it's this guy it's you you're the guy you gotta you
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.520]  gotta do it you gotta you gotta make that decision
[56:09.520 --> 56:16.560]  right uh but overall you know in seven years ish
[56:16.560 --> 56:19.840]  seven to eight years of selling weekly sponsorships
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.040]  there have been very few times where it's come up i mean and and they've
[56:23.040 --> 56:27.200]  even been very few times that that i've had to reject a sponsor
[56:27.200 --> 56:30.720]  seems like they know well i'm hoping yeah i'm hoping that uh
[56:30.720 --> 56:33.840]  that actually is a part of this it's it's partly me
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.520]  and it's also uh partly just in the environment that it's
[56:37.520 --> 56:40.640]  it's i'm hoping it doesn't happen this was one
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.440]  out of like 16 or it's not even that what 12 weeks one out of 14 weeks
[56:45.440 --> 56:47.840]  something like that well and like i said to you i really do
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.000]  think that that antivirus and cleaning utilities are sort of
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.440]  especially and like i said darker side is the antivirus
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.080]  are an exception yeah that there are i can't think of any other
[57:00.080 --> 57:03.360]  topic you know it's sort of advertiser that's in that area
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.560]  well i could i could see and again i don't think i would come down on the
[57:06.560 --> 57:08.320]  side of not running an ad for them but you know
[57:08.320 --> 57:11.520]  there are a lot of there are a lot of memes that go through our
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.000]  our community and our audiences as they and they're all interconnected right
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.640]  i have this thing with six colors where i see you post a link and i'm like well i
[57:18.640 --> 57:21.200]  could post a link to that but everybody's reading john's site so do i
[57:21.200 --> 57:24.000]  even need to bother or should i just link to john's link and say just read
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.440]  john's link about it you know we are all kind of in the same
[57:27.440 --> 57:30.400]  ecosystem together and there are some of the memes that come out like
[57:30.400 --> 57:32.880]  there's the whole you know if you're not paying for the product then you're the
[57:32.880 --> 57:36.240]  then you're the uh you're what they're selling
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.440]  and i could see something like that coming up where there's some product
[57:39.440 --> 57:42.160]  that is going to sponsor you and what they're really wanting
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.080]  obviously it's free and isn't it great and i could see people being like hey
[57:46.080 --> 57:48.640]  that's you know that's no good there's this other developer who's trying to
[57:48.640 --> 57:50.880]  sell it these guys are doing it for free and they're just going to get our
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.000]  information and all that i could see scenario like that although
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.280]  it doesn't seem to have come up up to now but i could i could see something
[57:57.280 --> 58:02.080]  like that that would be um unpopular with a part of the
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.680]  community because it seems to be the kind of thing that we all rail against
[58:05.680 --> 58:09.360]  like what you were saying about the app bundles thing but i i think it's
[58:09.360 --> 58:11.680]  encouraging that you haven't seen a lot of that
[58:11.680 --> 58:15.200]  and that's and that's good but i i think i think it's worth you know this is so
[58:15.200 --> 58:17.520]  inside baseball but i think it's worth people hearing that
[58:17.520 --> 58:20.640]  it's not like we don't think about these issues and take them seriously and and
[58:20.640 --> 58:24.000]  honestly i think that's one of the downsides of the big organizations
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.840]  with the separations of church and state is there's a clear message and i think
[58:27.840 --> 58:30.560]  people even get trained to expect it from everybody
[58:30.560 --> 58:34.720]  which is you know we don't care it's like the editors
[58:34.720 --> 58:37.920]  are the ones you talk to they have no power you never you never talk to the
[58:37.920 --> 58:40.320]  sales people the organization doesn't really care
[58:40.320 --> 58:44.960]  unless it's a serious black eye for the organization and so you know why
[58:44.960 --> 58:48.320]  even bother there's just going to be cruddy stuff that gets advertised and
[58:48.320 --> 58:50.400]  with us you know we do take it seriously and
[58:50.400 --> 58:53.120]  that's that's not true that's not how we want it to be i mean there's also a
[58:53.120 --> 58:56.720]  reason that our sites don't have junk all over them
[58:56.720 --> 58:59.680]  because that's crappy but uh big
[58:59.680 --> 59:04.800]  organizations have no problem littering their sites with with junk uh
[59:04.800 --> 59:10.960]  j rosen who teaches journalism at nyu and is a you know
[59:10.960 --> 59:14.720]  big presence and when you in in sort of the whole inside baseball
[59:14.720 --> 59:18.640]  world of of online journalism but i mean i think he said i want to put words in
[59:18.640 --> 59:22.480]  his mouth but something to the effect of if you work at a publication doesn't
[59:22.480 --> 59:26.560]  matter whether it's print or online or both or whether it's new or old
[59:26.560 --> 59:30.560]  but if it's big enough you know that it's not just like a one-person thing
[59:30.560 --> 59:34.320]  but it's big and you can you can be isolated and just
[59:34.320 --> 59:38.480]  concentrate on editorial if you don't understand the business model
[59:38.480 --> 59:41.840]  right of the publication you're you're you're
[59:41.840 --> 59:45.200]  screwed you're not you're you're not being responsible and you're probably
[59:45.200 --> 59:47.040]  screwed yeah well the way he phrases you should
[59:47.040 --> 59:49.360]  quit your job which is probably a little extreme
[59:49.360 --> 59:54.720]  but he's not wrong that you should um you should understand why your company
[59:54.720 --> 59:57.840]  does what it does and what decisions they're making and whether they're good
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.480]  or not and you know i over the years
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.000]  i have been fortunate to work with a bunch of incredibly talented people
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.480]  but what i will say is i was always surprised
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.960]  at how some incredibly intelligent talented people
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.760]  would have no conception about how parts of our business worked
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.840]  even though some of that was communicated fairly clearly
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.640]  and some of that has to do with frame of reference and some of that has to do
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.920]  with not wanting to hear it because if you're trained as a journalist
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.400]  and you hear from the sales guys or the business people
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.440]  it's very easy to put that in a box it's like that's not my concern in fact it's
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440]  my duty to not even pay attention to that
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.200]  but it always surprised me that i i would hear even up to the end
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.680]  um and one of the things rosen points out too is that you need to know the
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.520]  difference between what product people refer
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.800]  to as product and what editorial people refer to as product which is super
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.440]  important because the media today so much of what
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.400]  happens at these sites is based on the product roadmap and
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.080]  product managers and developers and you know the product is not just the words
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.200]  on the website the product is the features of the website and the design
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.240]  of the website and and and tools that editors can use to
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.600]  build things on the website and if you're thinking of the product as
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.080]  being what you write or as product as being some weird amorphous
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.960]  sales thing you are you have a really distorted view of what your business is
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.640]  and that's probably not that's probably not a healthy place to
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.120]  be and i would have that where i would have people
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.840]  talking about hr or developers or marketing people people not in ad
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.280]  sales and the and people who'd been at the
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.240]  company for a long time would say oh well those are that you know those
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.800]  are sales people it's like no they're not sales people
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.400]  they're they're other parts of the business that aren't editorial
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.800]  but they're not sales people and you know that i understand why people would
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.680]  cultivate a simplified view in the sense of like i just don't want
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.960]  to hear it i don't want to know about it but in reality i think it is a good
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.440]  thing to know about that stuff and understand
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.880]  it and understand your place in it and then if it doesn't make you comfortable
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.000]  it certainly makes you a better judge of whether the decisions your business is
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  making are solid or are bad or desperate
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.240]  and if you are in any position to determine what kind of stuff
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.840]  is going to go in the product right then
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.320]  knowing where your business is going could actually help you could actually
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.880]  get some good ideas or helps have a bigger voice in deciding what
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.880]  uh what gets built next so i thought that piece while
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.880]  a little bit hypey and uh saying you should quit your job is a little bit
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.400]  rich but uh he's not wrong about a lot of those points that you really should
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.240]  understand the business that you're in yeah i think he he has a sort of
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.080]  better to overstate it than understated style
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.920]  yeah well and without with without without going into
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.360]  uh sensationalism and well i'm trying to communicate some of this stuff i mean
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.120]  like i said some of this you're you're you're trying to battle against la la
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.000]  la i don't want to hear it it's not my job it's in the business side i'm an
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.560]  editor i don't need to hear it so you kind of do need to shout
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.520]  sometimes and say no no no pay attention to this
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.520]  especially something like the difference between
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.840]  what you know product i mean that's come up in a bunch of cases where people have
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.200]  angrily left various website startups who are editorial people
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.240]  they're like oh they're just they're just in it for the product and it's like
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.440]  i dealt with uh at the end there at idg i worked with a
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.040]  really great product manager and he and i spent a lot of time talking about ways
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.600]  we could improve the product unfortunately most of those things
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.400]  never got prioritized but that was a great experience because we
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.760]  were working together editorial and product management to
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.080]  identify things that would make the website better and and and sometimes
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.440]  it's better to refer to it that way than to say the product because that
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.480]  sounds a little bit like you're selling something but the fact is
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.760]  you know my editors were frustrated by the fact that all they could really do
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.120]  was put text in the cms and why can't we do this and why can't we
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.600]  do that and the answer was well we could do that if we
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.960]  worked with the product group but you got to speak their language
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.480]  and that is a challenge so i i appreciate when rosen sort of waves his
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.440]  hands and it's like hey pay attention this is really important
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.480]  because a lot of people in journalism don't want to hear that they want to
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.720]  just work and it's a natural response right to be
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.280]  like no no i'm just going to do my thing that i'm comfortable with
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.840]  but i think it leads to bad bad places i think it's a
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.120]  it's a danger it's dangerous to use the word religion but i do feel
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.680]  like in a casual way it it the belief
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.360]  that if you're a journalist that you should
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.520]  you you're almost like obligated in a moral sense to
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.040]  not pay attention to the business side was ingrained in
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.400]  at least a generation maybe several generations
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.840]  especially i don't know if it's especially u.s centric or not
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.360]  but it it certainly seems so in the newspaper industry that it was just
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.440]  almost almost religious that it was you know
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.960]  and and it was only sustainable because newspapers were
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.080]  you know like you said they had a monopoly yeah and they were incredibly
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.160]  profitable licensed print money right i remember when i was at the
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.400]  inquirer there was a time where they had and this is in the late
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.840]  90s where they had buyouts because they had a quarter where their
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.600]  profit margin was 19 percent
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.600]  they were the inquirer was a night ritter paper wow
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.120]  and they were so they the 20 was like this
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.560]  like red line in the sand you know like well i guess you can't have
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.720]  a line in the sand uh and you know they did they dipped to 19 and they were
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.040]  like instantly went into red alert and you
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.160]  know sirens went off and they like bought people out
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.680]  and it was crazy like i don't know if you guys have this i think it's an
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.960]  an east coast thing called metro it's a free
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.720]  daily newspaper i don't even know if they're still around here in philly but
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:54.720]  it was they they were a free daily um and they set up most of their kiosks
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.880]  at commuter entrances subway entrances bus stops
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:04.560]  um not real thick but you know it you know it was definitely a
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.680]  competitor to you know the inquirer in the daily news
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.040]  and you know because if you could read the metro for free
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.760]  and fin you know finish it before you got where you were going you had no
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.160]  reason to buy the inquirer daily news right
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.880]  um and it led to crazy scenarios like the guy who is in charge i i as
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.920]  the graphic design work i did i worked with a lot of the
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.200]  classified advertising people and did a lot of the
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.400]  promotional stuff that they needed to sell you know give to people
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.920]  um and so like the guy he was a great guy i forget his name but he was in
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.000]  charge of auto advertising classified or all auto
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.320]  advertising which was huge huge huge business took the buyout which
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.120]  was like two or three years salary and a week later he took the job as the
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.680]  automotive ad guy at metro at the metro like
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.360]  and it was like they just paid him three years salary to go
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.960]  and and start selling ads at arrival
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.240]  and and but while they were still incredibly profitable i mean it was just
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.640]  crazy i mean i i've definitely experienced the
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.760]  layoffs while we're profitable where the where the business people are like no no
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.920]  we're profitable we're going to make a profit we're profitable
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.000]  and then they lay off 10 people and there is nothing worse than saying
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.560]  you can't work here anymore because we're not quite making enough profit
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.440]  and that and that's a disconnect in business i mean there are businesses
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.600]  that are all about looking for growth and investment
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.480]  and there are businesses that are just trying to be sustainable profitable
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.240]  businesses that can employ a bunch of people and and
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.480]  that too is part of the disconnect of like not
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.520]  understanding what kind of business you work for and what their metrics are and
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.040]  not on a very detailed level of like what's the bonus that structure for the
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.280]  sales people but to understand like what are they looking for and uh you
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.240]  know what what do they what what do they expect from us and what's
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.880]  the growth and some some of that is uh it has to come from the top and you
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.400]  know in my years i would get a very varying degree of that depending on who
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.680]  the ceo was of you know what do we show the employees
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.240]  and uh to a varying degree the employees wanted to or didn't want to hear it
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.160]  but uh i think that's just a dangerous situation to be in to not understand
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.880]  what kind of company you're working for and what their what their goals are i
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.480]  mean at night ritter at least it was clear that 20 was the line and
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.600]  if you weren't showing 20 profit margin um that was that was red alert time boy
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.640]  those days and i think i i think the danger there
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.880]  is that it seemed very clear like because i wasn't involved i wasn't going
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.520]  to be my career i wasn't never even full-time i was
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.320]  always like a contractor but i loved the business and you know i love being
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.120]  but my view from like the ground floor and
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.640]  just looking at the whole thing was that it was so clear to me once i got in
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.920]  and sort of got the gist of how the philadelphia inquirer ran at the time
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.400]  that the people who were in that building working on that newspaper
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:56.480]  were incredible people absolutely amazing people um i forget the
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:01.760]  exact years but there's a stretch from like the mid 80s to mid 90s where
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.800]  the philadelphia inquirer won more pulitzer prizes than any
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.320]  newspaper in the us yeah it was a tremendous
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.280]  tremendous team and eventually all these this great talent
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.880]  that wound up you know working at the new york times and washington post and
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.720]  newsweek and time and they all took these buyouts and went to these other
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.120]  places but at the time it was amazing and they you know were dedicated to the
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.200]  craft and dedicated to the civic you know duty of a newspaper in a big
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:31.760]  metropolitan city and all this stuff but it was so clear that night ritter
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.400]  was an it was a corporate as a corporate parent
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.400]  didn't give two shits if they were selling widgets
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.520]  or newspapers or whatever as long as they hit that 20 profit margin and had
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.120]  growth didn't matter what they were doing
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.320]  had no no no no love or interest in what it meant to actually be making a
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.440]  newspaper and and you know like we were saying
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.000]  when you're when you've got the license to print money you can
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.360]  it's a little bit easier to be blissfully ignorant but i i
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.120]  you know i i think again somebody could listen to this podcast and say aha
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.880]  here they are they're all admitting that uh that journalism is not truly
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.440]  objective it's uh actually affected by what the
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.040]  business does well you know the truth is of course it is unless you
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.640]  are consumer reports or something and even then
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.160]  you have the objective of getting donations and if you don't get them you
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.760]  can't stay in business there is always a fundamental precept
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.400]  of a of a media business about what they're doing and and what
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.080]  why they're doing it and like a sports writer at the philadelphia inquirer
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.840]  who is from uh san francisco can't say you know i've decided i'm going to write
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.040]  about the giants right it's like no no we're in the
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.400]  business of covering philadelphia and i got that when i went to mac user
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.680]  they told me like apple's big in education but we're not targeting
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.560]  education it's like that was that was the target market our target
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.200]  market market was the mac and it was it was the business market
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.120]  primarily and then secondarily you know other users using it at home
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.320]  but not education and why was that because they didn't spend a lot of money
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.240]  and those advertisers advertisers didn't want to reach them because of that
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.920]  and yeah that was that was focusing what we could write about
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.880]  but you know that's just a fundamental business constraint what
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.640]  you know the the objectivity comes on like on the inside of those constraints
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.040]  like this is what this publication is this is what this
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.600]  website is whatever it is and then within there
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.560]  i need to be free to make the decisions about the best way to serve that
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.400]  audience but how do you choose the audience
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.440]  in large part in most of these businesses is
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.480]  you're choosing an audience you can make money selling ads to and
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.480]  that's okay but um that is a fundamental thing that i mean
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.960]  journalistic uh freedom only goes so far there is a fundamental precept of your
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.560]  business that you do need to follow as much as that guy might like to write
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.720]  about not if not the giants write about darts or uh canadian
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.800]  football or whatever it's like that's not what you're
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.800]  here to do that's not who we serve with with the philadelphia inquirer
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.960]  right uh yeah and you have to be able to you know
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.320]  even even in our lean mean you know one person
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.680]  type operations like six colors or darren fireball you still have to be
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.200]  able to you know do it in a way that makes sense
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.920]  financially and and the thing that makes me think about that
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.280]  so in the whole you know 10-15 years you could
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.520]  it's very very feasible to just run a web blog
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.640]  out of your pocket you know i think i i could
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.680]  i forget what i pay per month for doing fireball but if i really wanted to go
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.520]  for if i just wanted to do it without any sponsorships or ads or any revenue
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.160]  at all even with the readership i have i think
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.360]  it would be like a hundred dollars a month yeah maybe maybe i could probably
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.400]  find a way to you could do it you could certainly do it for 50
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.240]  right i'm paying 50 and i'm running the incomparable and six colors on the same
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:43.680]  same server for 50 a month it's not a problem yeah
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.920]  but the reason that podcasting has exploding has exploded recently is that
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.600]  until recently it was financially unfeasible there was no way
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.960]  it it doesn't seem like that long ago when i started during fireball but
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.600]  there's just no way financially that in 2002 2003 2004
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.040]  that i could distribute 100 100 megabyte mp3 files to thousands of people
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.800]  it would have it it would have cost thousands and thousands of dollars a
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.200]  month even a couple years ago i think that would have been the case
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.200]  no it's it it the the rise in podcasting correlates
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:22.000]  exactly to when it became financially pretty cheap yeah through
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.080]  borderline cloud or libsyn or squarespace or or through a hosting
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.280]  company that gives you a you know a terabyte of data for fifty dollars a
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.960]  month that sort of thing right but until recently there there was
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.840]  no such thing you know the the the bandwidth limits were
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.600]  you know in the low gigabytes or even the hot you know hundreds of megabytes
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.040]  and so if your files are you know typical podcast
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.000]  for this show is somewhere around 100 megabytes sometimes a little less
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.960]  sometimes a little more depending on how long it is but
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.400]  um you know every hundred people that's 100
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.000]  or that's a gigabyte yeah right or no every 10 people
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.040]  i don't know it adds up that's a really fast i did them i did the math when we
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.320]  were pulling the incomparable off of uh five by five and i was trying to figure
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.280]  out whether we would host that on our own server or whether we wanted to use a
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.240]  cdn for it and and i did the math and i was like wow
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.320]  that's a lot of data just on a regular episode of a moderately popular podcast
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.080]  it's a it's a just in five years ago terms
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.240]  an impossible amount of data and cost aside
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.920]  it wasn't even something people would tolerate you know when they were
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.280]  connecting with very slow connections they might think i'd like to listen to
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.000]  that but jesus it's going to take all night to download oh yeah
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.200]  yeah i remember those days of like you know leave them leave the mac on
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.480]  downloading podcasts and itunes because it's going to take forever all right but
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.040]  you really you need to understand stuff like that you know
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.920]  you need to know that if you're going to do video you're probably going to have
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.880]  to host it youtube or something like that just because that way you don't
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.440]  have to pay the bill yeah and you better know what the
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.440]  terms are for youtube then and you know are you going to use youtube's ads and
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.520]  what percentage do you get and is that going to
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.560]  you know then how many people do you need to get is viewing each video for
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.720]  you to be able to make a living doing that
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.240]  right yeah you've you know it's not too complicated but
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.920]  you've got to there's there's all these abstractions where you can just pretend
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.240]  that these things don't exist and you don't have to worry about them
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.440]  they're that it doesn't work like that right
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.200]  uh let me take a break good time to take a break and thank another long time
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.200]  friend of the show our good friends at squarespace

[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.160]  squarespace can handle the audio too that's another cost effective way yes
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.400]  absolutely you could do a blog you can do a podcast at squarespace
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.280]  but what if you have a totally different idea in mind something that's more like
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.280]  an online store where you want to sell stuff
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.320]  well guess what squarespace can do that uh portfolio maybe you're a designer or
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.280]  a photographer or something like that you want to create an online portfolio
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.720]  of your work uh well squarespace can do that just
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.960]  about any kind of thing you could need to build a website
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.280]  for squarespace has those sort of components right there
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.880]  ready for you to drag and drop into your own custom
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.360]  design they have templates to choose from to
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.240]  start with beautiful templates and that they scale
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.040]  right from your phone to tablet to 27 inch 5k
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.920]  retina imac
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.320]  and they have the brand new squarespace 7 this is the latest version of
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:39.040]  squarespace totally redesigned everything is
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.080]  right there you don't really have to if you're logged into your account instead
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.800]  of a separate editing mode when you want
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.520]  to change stuff you just do it right there
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.720]  it is sort of the original vision for hypertext
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.040]  where the big complaint against the the worldwide web when it you know came out
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.760]  in 1993 1994 was that editing was something you did in a text
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.880]  editor through ftp and you had to know html and uh browsing
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.520]  was something you did in the browser why can't you edit right there in the
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.480]  browser well that's what squarespace 7 does you just look at what you're
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.400]  looking at it's wizzy wig and you drag what you want to drag you
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.880]  take out what you want to take out you add what you want to add
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.440]  right there in place they've added integration with google apps
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.360]  they have a new partnership with getty images so if you want to get
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.120]  stock photography stock imagery you could do it right there through the

[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.000]  is going on i don't know i mean the funny thing
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.960]  about this time of year is it's uh it's pretty quiet and uh you're talking
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.600]  about going out on my own we used to have like a whole staff who
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.560]  would come up with ideas of like stuff you could write that you could put in the
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.000]  system and just sort of have it play out over
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.640]  the last two weeks of the year when nothing was going on and
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.280]  doing this myself i'm like oh yeah i should probably put something i should
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.760]  probably write something today because there's nothing going on
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.960]  but it's difficult because there's really you know there's nothing going on
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:23.360]  so you end up writing lots of hey let's look back at 2014 and
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.120]  what did we learn and what are my favorite things and i don't know it's it's
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.280]  a tough it's a tough time of year because there
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.920]  isn't a lot of tech stuff going on i've used it in the past this year i've
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.160]  just been busy it's just been a crazy busy
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.840]  holiday thing with family and travel and stuff but a lot of times i use this the
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.520]  lull period to write um
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.200]  something that it might take a long time and therefore you know
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.240]  like if i have a big thought piece on you know
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.560]  where i what we know about the apple watch now two or three months later
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:59.360]  um i wish i had more time for that maybe in this coming week i will but i have
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.560]  idea but something like that where it's not has nothing to do with
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.560]  what's new or news but just take advantage of the fact that there isn't
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.840]  any news to really focus on and write it
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.840]  something like that right yeah i um that's one of the things
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.320]  that i've been grappling with and doing the site is is how do you
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.400]  balance writing um you know being a one-person operation
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.240]  right if you're busy writing a deep think piece about something that's going
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.600]  to go on for a thousand words you're not writing things to post on the
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.200]  site today and i feel i feel like with a less established site like mine i
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.520]  definitely feel pressure to keep the lights on
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.720]  every day and uh and try to balance those things and
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:41.520]  you know you you have a different pace you you can post some links and then you
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.240]  put out a bigger piece every so often and i i like your pace but i don't feel
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.800]  like i i can do that right now i feel like i
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.080]  need to keep the keep the heartbeat a little stronger because i'm trying to
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.840]  establish myself and and and pick up uh and pick up uh an
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.600]  audience that i may not have you know have captured yet but then i
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.080]  end up in this situation where it's like wow it's going to take me three days to
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:05.840]  write like the review of the of the retina imac was an example where
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.440]  i it took me like two or three days to write that and one of my challenges was
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.200]  always um should i keep writing this now or
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.560]  should i stop and find something short to write and post to the site just to
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.480]  let people know i'm still alive while i'm also writing this longer piece and
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.120]  trying to find that balance is is uh is tricky it's one of the again not
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.200]  being on a team anymore and being just myself i i've learned the powerful
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.640]  lesson of how little one person is capable of of
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:36.480]  producing versus a staff then every once in a while though i
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.920]  surprise myself and i'm like holy crap i got a lot done in the last
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:43.360]  a lot published in the last 24 hours like not just like
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.560]  stuff that i'd been working on for a long time and happen to finish it
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:51.520]  i would just be like wow i i got like eight links and a full article all done
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.200]  in the last day why can't i do this every day
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:57.120]  well i think i think part of it is is energy and part of it is that
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.640]  that stuff doesn't always happen like that right i mean there are days i i
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.200]  know exactly what you're talking about and maybe i didn't recognize them as
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.360]  much before as i do now but there are those
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.040]  days where it's like oh my god there's like five great links and there's
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.920]  like three articles i could write about things that happen today
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.960]  and those are wonderful days and and maybe you defer a couple of those
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.160]  articles to later in the week and you just keep on writing about it
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:21.520]  and then there are other times when when it's just like wow what is
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.000]  happening nothing is happening and and you know ces is going to happen
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.160]  next week i think yeah january 5th and there's always something interesting to
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.160]  write about there even if it's sort of the anti
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.000]  ces i'm very happy to not be going to ces this year
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.280]  um but uh so that you know things the news cycle will
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.360]  will spin up again but you're right it is kind of nice to have that
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.720]  ability to either spend time with family or reflect a little bit or work on a
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.200]  longer term project and you know i've been thinking about that
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.120]  too but with travel it becomes a lot harder to uh to uh find the time to do
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.760]  that stuff when you're when you're traveling or with family and
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.800]  all that yeah do you have the um i know i don't know did i don't know if
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.320]  you've ever i know i happen to know that six colors is running on movable type
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.280]  yes uh i've been reading them write a post
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.560]  about that at some point just like kind of come out of the closet and be like
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.440]  yes like it might it might be the last the
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:20.000]  last new major site to launch on it's possible i heard from the people who
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.480]  were doing the current version of movable type because i'm using movable
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.120]  type four which i think maybe you're using
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.000]  yes definitely the last i mean the joke would be the last good version that's
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.400]  what a lot of it because five was not so good and i
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.320]  heard from the people who are the current
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.440]  support license people for movable type and they're like you know that we want
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.480]  to talk maybe we can give you a license and you you know we can use you as an
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.120]  example and and on on one level i was like oh
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.840]  that's interesting but then i also was kind of thinking i'm not sure they they
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.760]  added anything that i would actually want and i'm fortunate to have my friend
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.400]  greg noss is like savant with pearl for one and
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.760]  movable type for two and so in a way i've got an off the
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.440]  shelf you know cms from five years ago or eight years ago
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.600]  and a guy who can customize it to do whatever and so that's pretty good and i
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.920]  threw out all their templates i didn't use any of their templates when i built
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.320]  the site templates it's all original templates
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.800]  um but uh you know sometimes it's just go with what you know and all the
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.240]  movable type is old and weird um i also know it like i i i could have
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.680]  done wordpress but i actually don't know wordpress i would have to learn a lot
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.640]  about wordpress or squarespace or anything that i was
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.280]  doing and i thought i've already got the server here it's already running
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.080]  movable type for some other projects why not just do that i i can do that
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.640]  without learning anything about the cms and i can just
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.200]  focus on the content and getting the templates live
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.040]  and when i was launching a site in a week that seemed like a good idea so
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.920]  you know it's do you do you have the i am
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.000]  i m t plugin that led to gives you like a
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.400]  posting interface from the iphone oh i don't think i do
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.000]  see that to me is the game changer and i don't know
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.360]  and i know that wordpress has like a pretty good maybe even
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:07.680]  better iphone optimized interface um uh i'm gonna i forget who else wrote
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:14.000]  imt i know brad chote c h o a t e who is a long time uh six apart employee yeah
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.560]  yeah wrote the plugin originally it it goes
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.120]  back to like 2008 i mean it came out or maybe even 2007 it came out very early
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.520]  it's you know it doesn't give you all of movable type it only gives you
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.680]  just pick a blog either pick a make a new entry
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.840]  or edit an existing entry and then when you open an entry
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.840]  it it's just you know here here's the fields that you show it so i hacked mine
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.080]  a little bit just to make it a little bit more
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.840]  specific to how i use the fields but uh yeah well that's what i did with um like
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.160]  greg wrote a plug-in that does audio processing because
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.600]  doing podcasts and movable type is problematic because movable type doesn't
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.920]  know like what the byte count is and you're
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.800]  supposed to put that in the rss feed the length and the byte count of the file
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.600]  you're linking to and so he just wrote a plug-in for me
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.640]  that that does that and that means i can keep using it it is a little bit like
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.920]  uh you know an it person saying i know that there have been five versions of
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.600]  adobe photoshop that have come out but we're just going to stay on you know
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.280]  version three because it works for us and we're okay
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.120]  right it's a little like that being on this old cms but it works fine
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.360]  and if at the point that it doesn't work fine
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.560]  it's got a perfectly reasonable database format and i could migrate it somewhere
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.200]  else but um you know like i said knowing somebody
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.600]  who can write a movable type plug-in um in in a few hours to solve a problem
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.240]  helps a lot i could do anything with the six colors
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.600]  though it's so simple the incomparable is much crazier it's in movable type but
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.480]  it's got like multiple blogs and they're all related to each other so it's like a
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.360]  relational database yeah right yeah well the incomparable is
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.920]  no longer one thing right right because it's multiple
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.560]  podcasts so we've got we've got a podcast
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.000]  blog and an episodes blog and they they interrelate and that's how you can
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.400]  generate multiple podcast feeds and a master list and a master
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.080]  feed and all of that is actually a bunch of movable type things that's a
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.040]  totally crazy thing but it works um and and uh we built it
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:13.520]  because there was just things that uh that the dan benjamin cms didn't offer
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.320]  and they were not things dan should ever have built because his other
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.520]  shows would never use them but for like i want an index so that
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.040]  people can find out that we talked about raiders of the lost ark in like episode
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.400]  eight or something and they can go to a page and scroll
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.520]  down to raiders of the lost ark and there's a link to the podcast where we
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.160]  talked about it and dan's dan's site was never going to do
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.840]  that and that's not his fault it's just it didn't make sense for him but i wanted
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.880]  those features so we built this crazy thing in movable type
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.600]  and um you know it's it's it's crazy but it works pretty well and
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.720]  once i had that up and running it was really easy to just add
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.920]  the the six colors uh blog on onto movable type too because i was already
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.960]  wrangling it and greg already knew it and so we decided to do that too
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.000]  the nice thing about movable type is you know its template language is fairly
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.840]  simple but it's pretty robust and um and it's uh it's rendering static
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.160]  pages which means you're not going to get fireballed
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.120]  which is nice too well everybody renders static pages it's just a question of
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.360]  whether they're rendering them immediately or whether they're calling
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.600]  it caching well that's true that's true and caching
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600]  with with wordpress has gotten a lot better
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.040]  um which is which is good and i've used wordpress it's just i'm not comfortable
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.200]  with it um it's interesting to see
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.680]  stuff like this is is is in some cases is a nerd litmus test a little bit right
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.160]  it's like oh what blog platform do you use and
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.560]  and there's some movable type is not cool it's old and weird but
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.560]  right tool for the job you know right tool for the job and and and uh
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.080]  i'm a big believer in that that that i shouldn't have to spend a week getting
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.960]  up to speed in a platform that's going to let me do exactly what i was going to
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.960]  do on the thing that i already know um and if i had to jump i would in fact
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.520]  when i'm thinking about doing like site registrations or something for for
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.760]  the website that that uh one option i have to do like a
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.680]  a membership a voluntary membership for six colors there's a move or there's a
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.520]  there's a wordpress plugin that does a good job with that i think that's what
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.560]  ben thompson's using it might be and it's what sean blanc is
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.960]  using or if not he's customized yeah yeah but sean blanc i know told me about
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.440]  it and um you know if if i if i want to use
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.920]  that tool i can set up a wordpress instance
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.400]  too and use that for that and not for the rest of it and just have them
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.680]  interconnect and i can do that too it's not
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.760]  you know it's it's not necessarily bad to to do stuff like that but it does make
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.800]  me feel not cool when i get i got an email the other day from somebody was
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.520]  like i i see uh your this feature on your blog
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.200]  and i would like to implement that i assume you use wordpress like i do how
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:50.640]  did you do it i'm like oh okay bad news not using wordpress yeah i've gotten that
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.800]  over the years too with like the combined
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.080]  posts thing although we're you know you can definitely do it in wordpress but
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.600]  you would have to do it in a different way
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.160]  yeah yeah and and again i don't know how you do it in wordpress but i know
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.280]  exactly how you do it movable type so especially for just wanting to get it up
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.920]  soon it made it made a lot of sense to to do
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.560]  that i i you know i kind of like movable type
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.080]  it's funky and weird but um i had an argument with somebody where
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.200]  they were talking about what real real markdown was i mean don't get me started
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.080]  don't get you started but uh i had a moment where i said you
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.360]  know i still consider markdown.pl the definitive markdown and they uh very i
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.600]  think thought they're being very smart they said
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.720]  yeah but you don't actually you know how much of what you do actually gets
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.120]  processed by markdown.pl and i said all of it because either i
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.640]  run it in a script in bbedit and it outputs html and i paste that in
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.920]  somewhere or i'm using movable type which is using
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.360]  the markdown.pl on the fly to convert those to html so
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:53.760]  i'm you know it has that advantage too even my uh the markdown dingus
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.720]  at daring fireball which is an extremely popular
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:02.160]  um thing i mean i had thousands of it the number of people who use that web
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.520]  page every day is greater than i think the daily
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:10.880]  readership of daring fireball when i went full-time it's it's that popular uh
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.560]  it's just a little php form where you can enter some markdown hit a button and
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.560]  then it gives you the output beneath which
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.280]  you can then copy and paste elsewhere um which i originally wrote just for
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.600]  people i didn't think people would actually use it as a
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.280]  as a tool tool i thought it was just like if you're learning this if you're
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:31.440]  reading about this and you want to learn type something here and then you can see
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.080]  the output here and there's no better way to learn
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.760]  then you know you can see that you put asterisks around the word
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.200]  and then in the output it puts m tags around the word
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.360]  um but people use it on a daily basis just like oh i want to convert
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.280]  i need to get some i need to have this in html i'll quick dash it out here hit
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.120]  the button and copy and paste it and i have
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.560]  so anyway that's great but it's a little form written in php
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.840]  but behind the scenes it still calls out to the pearl version
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:03.520]  and it's it sounds when i did that i thought well that's
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.360]  never going to scale like if this page gets popular it's got to be slow but
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.360]  it's not it's because the whole thing is so
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.560]  stupid simple that even if it's a php script
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:16.080]  that calls out to the unix shell and runs a pearl script on the text file and
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:19.600]  then puts the input back in it all takes place in a fraction of a second
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.760]  you're waiting longer for the network than you are for
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.400]  my server to do that it's amazing how far we've come
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.680]  yeah because i remember when running a pearl script was actually like
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.280]  you know stop the presses slow right it was like
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.360]  should i write this and see or should i just write like a pearl script and it's
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.880]  like well it'll take a second or two for pearl to fire up but you know what i
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:46.960]  don't so much easier i'll just do it
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.840]  uh i want to take a break and this isn't even a sponsor break i
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:54.160]  want to circle back half an hour i've uh the research department the the
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.360]  award-winning research department here at the talk show
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.880]  uh has found the white paper that i was talking about
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.440]  it's by wilfredo sanchez i cannot believe i forgot fred's name because
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:12.080]  i've even had drinks with him at wwdc great guy it's
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.960]  a usenex 2000 presentation so this is from the year 2000
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:20.320]  the challenges of integrating the unix and mac os
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.080]  environments and i will put it in the show notes guaranteed it is
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:30.800]  i i swear it sounds very dry but it is a terrific read if you have any
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.320]  technical interest in this sort of thing like well how do you square the circle
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.840]  of having a classic mac os with colon separators
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.360]  and unix with slash separators and other issues too
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.640]  like the fact that the unix file system didn't have file ids
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:48.560]  and the mac had aliases and didn't have symlinks and unix
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.000]  didn't have aliases and did have symlinks and etc etc how did they make
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.160]  it all work uh it is a wonderfully well you know
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.520]  it's typical just for someone who would be a great engineer at apple it is
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.040]  it's written in very very clear language so i will put it in the show notes
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.200]  i don't want to forget that that's right and my apollo my apologies to anybody out
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.280]  there who's listening who remembered uh
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.680]  that fred sanchez wrote that paper and for the last 45 minutes has been writing
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.440]  email while they listen to us continue on this show isn't that great when you
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.760]  get the twitter feedback that's like oh you can't
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.600]  the answer is this and you're like just keep listening we got it so
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.840]  my apologies to them i know where you are in the show right now
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.240]  your patience will be rewarded just keep on listening
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.160]  uh you had another oh you know what let's talk about the
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.040]  the interview sony thing oh yeah that is something that was going on
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:49.680]  over uh over christmas right this whole thing
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.320]  where uh sony entertainment got hacked by somebody many people including
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.680]  the u.s government believe either by the north korean government
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.560]  or by a group sponsored by the north korean government right
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.640]  perhaps in protest of this movie seth rogan
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.440]  uh james franco or as or as president obama called him james
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.840]  flaco james flaco yeah what i mean what's the story it was conflating him
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:24.080]  with the the ravens quarterback right joey flaco
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.600]  you know a movie that is about a comedy about them
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:33.440]  assassinating uh north korean leader kim jong at right it'd be true
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:38.720]  they're they're asked by the cia to to assassinate him yeah
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:44.080]  uh and then they got hacked and all this embarrassing stuff came out
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.520]  and then they got threatened there were threats
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.480]  whether they were real or imagined that any theater it was supposed to come out
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.520]  on christmas day i guess and any there were threats that any theater that
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.040]  showed it was going to you know perhaps suffer some kind of
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.840]  terrorist attack i think they said there would be another 9 11
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.040]  at another movie theaters near you yeah right which
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.400]  it doesn't seem like it seems implausible yeah yeah you're gonna fly
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.800]  how many airplanes into the movie theaters but
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:15.200]  anyway uh theaters decided uh i think
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.120]  i i think it was a mistake but i think they made a simple economic decision
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.600]  which was well christmas is a huge time for
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:25.040]  movies and period this movie in particular wasn't going to be a big hit
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.080]  anyway just screw this movie and keep the
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.800]  theaters open right and then you know next thing you know sony wanted to
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.680]  release it online and uh they did but itunes was not among
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.120]  the the the streaming outfits that had it on
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:44.320]  christmas day right um as we record we're recording on
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.320]  the 29th 29th it it hit itunes yesterday the 28.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.840]  i think that summarizes the situation yeah and there was a there was one weird
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.080]  story that i that suggested that sony had called
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.720]  the white house asking for help in getting apple to put
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.160]  it on itunes which i i i have not seen any
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.040]  corroboration of that but that was the one that that struck me as like that's
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.480]  weird that's a weird yeah that was the new york times and it was
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.960]  an off it was just like in the middle of the
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.320]  article and it was just sort of off hand i mean i don't know if that's your call
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.280]  the switchboard and you ask for eddie q's number or is that like president
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.920]  obama can you do us a solid and call tim cook
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.200]  there's a spectrum of what might have happened there
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.440]  and it's unclear from that there's sort of the implication that they wanted it
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.120]  to be an itunes exclusive and and but apple wasn't interested
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.480]  and then uh you know what ended up happening is that it went up
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:46.000]  on christmas eve on google play and on youtube on youtube
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.400]  on youtube for purchase or rental and xbox through xbox live
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:58.800]  correct but not itunes until until the 28th i guess right
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.040]  uh you know i wrote today i just before we started the show i
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.440]  i gave it my headline of the week award uh finally g
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.800]  what was the bgr's headline was apple oh god i don't want to get this wrong
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.920]  because it's so classic
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.320]  bgr's headline was apple finally decides to stand up
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.160]  to sony hackers releases the interview on itunes
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:28.240]  oh man so i you know whether it's true or not i
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.560]  nobody i've got nobody on the record but you know speaking to some people at
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:35.760]  apple nobody directly involved at itunes but people who know people who are
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.040]  involved at itunes that the story i've heard and it makes sense
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.680]  because like for example if you're a developer this is public knowledge
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.680]  itunes connect closes around like the 22nd or 23rd
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.360]  and and they even say you go to the itunes connect site they say itunes
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.400]  connect is closed until december 28th they close
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.800]  a couple days before christmas um and they don't open until a couple of
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.800]  days afterwards and that's it like whatever you want if
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.760]  you're a developer if you want to get a bug fix and you've got to get it in
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.440]  before they close and otherwise you're going to wait about a week because they
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.600]  want to give people time off so my understanding i think that what
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.880]  happened was apple and and the new york times article kind of hinted at this
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.920]  not that apple wasn't interested but they weren't interested in doing it on
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.080]  sony's timetable that it was this was like the blackout
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.880]  period for itunes and it's not easy like this stuff is
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.400]  non-trivial like to have all these movies streaming
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.520]  around the world it it takes a while for them to propagate
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.760]  around to the cdns the content delivery networks that apple uses
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.520]  and again in theory if they wanted to get it up on christmas i'm sure they
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.720]  could have but i think they would have had to call people back from vacation
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.960]  and you know make all sorts of exceptions and i just think apple's
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:54.880]  decision was this is not our problem you know yeah we have the movie if we
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.960]  get the movie three days from now so what
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.120]  yeah and i think they might have they might have said it's not going to be the
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.440]  bigger thing i don't know i i look at the
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.920]  i look at how this story had gone and kind of think that somebody at apple
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  probably should have said um let's be prepared to slide this thing
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.160]  up on christmas day just because that may be how this goes i
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.960]  think it was clear a while ago people were talking about
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.840]  maybe they would just make it available video on demand
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.960]  um and i know that that's uh yeah that's probably telling an employee
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.400]  or two at apple that they need to they need to come to work or be on call
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.480]  to come to work over the holiday and that sucks but at the same time you
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.720]  know although that headline is ridiculous i
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.800]  do feel like um there was a chance here for apple to
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.960]  just kind of be a part of the story and instead the story was oh
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.240]  apple doesn't have it that's weird and i don't know i mean if they're in the
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.720]  business of working with the studios to get this stuff up wouldn't you want to
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.680]  be seen as being on the on the forefront of this and being
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.280]  flexible enough to get it up and i kind of feel like what was revealed is that
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.000]  apple systems are a little bit rickety and uh and they were they were running a
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.480]  skeleton crew and so they just couldn't get it up in
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.680]  in time for the for the timing of it which is kind of weird although if you've
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.720]  used itunes connect it's not unreasonable to think that
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:12.800]  that's a weird you know back-end system that regular
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.400]  people never have to see but yeah you know it's not a big deal but it is a
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.640]  little surprising that it shouldn't apple be at the forefront of this stuff
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.280]  and be like sure we can put that up no problem
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.640]  i don't know yeah i do i do kind of feel that aside you know and again who knows
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.120]  what the actual capabilities are i don't know for
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:30.640]  sure but i do think that it might be true that apple's back-end system for
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.880]  this stuff is less nimble than you know and you know
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.560]  no surprise that google might be a lot more nimble in this regard
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.840]  yeah yeah that they can do something quicker they can pull something
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.960]  put put it up quicker and have it propagate and
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.400]  stream around the world quicker than apple can i mean apple
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.440]  apple's still the company that when they make changes to the store has to take
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.280]  the score down for an hour or two yeah exactly exactly
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.760]  yeah i i just think that's that's part of the story and they've gotten
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:00.400]  better at it but it also used to be that there would be like tv shows
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.920]  that would come out and it was like supposed to be released on midnight after
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:06.000]  the after the show aired or something like
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.080]  that and then on itunes it would always be like sometime the next day
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.600]  or maybe the day after and i never knew whether that meant that somebody at the
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.160]  tv studio just didn't get the file to them in time
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.080]  or whether it was like literally there's a lag in itunes connect for
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.360]  content and you know the systems are slow or the
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.680]  approval is slow and that stuff gets uh gets delayed and they seem to be
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.960]  better at that now too but it's possible i don't know it's also
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.440]  possible that google and microsoft and whoever else
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.200]  posted this thing had no problem telling their staff to work on christmas
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.240]  and maybe they maybe they had that plan and apple has this kind of corporate
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.760]  culture of dismissing everybody for that period of
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.880]  time and uh you know maybe that's that played
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.320]  into this too i don't know it's not really anybody though right i
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.400]  mean it can't really be everybody because
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.680]  you know on christmas morning when everybody's launching you know new
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.600]  ipods or ipads somebody somebody's got to be there there are always people on
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.960]  call so that that's the part that just i don't know maybe they just didn't think
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.960]  it was that big a deal and that it was uh
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.320]  that they didn't need to be there um it's just it's funny in the end when
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.200]  the president is talking about it in his news conference it's probably a big
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.520]  enough deal to pay attention to it i think if you're apple
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.560]  just to not be even if you're not going to be the own exclusive
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.200]  provider of it to not be the one major player who's not providing it and i'm
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.320]  not saying they were afraid or anything that it's a lot of stupidity and in
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.120]  those statements but i'm just saying for pr purposes
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.320]  alone don't you want to be not seen as being a step behind
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.760]  microsoft and google play yeah i totally agree with that and and
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.480]  though the movie is a silly stupid comedy and not like a
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.920]  serious political statement which you know what i
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:51.120]  think if it had been if it had been some kind of like documentary on north korea
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.840]  that had
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.560]  you know sparked the hack and the public need to see this movie
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.840]  right that i bet i i wouldn't be surprised if apple had made the
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:04.800]  exception then but i feel like it almost doesn't matter
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.720]  like and i actually did rent the movie have you rented it no
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.320]  it was really bad yeah that's what i've heard is that i mean i did not
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.000]  i don't love those guys at their best but uh at their worst seems like
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.720]  not a not a best showing for them no there are very few movies that even
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.480]  even though i'm like halfway through and like wow i regret running this but i'll
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.680]  i'll stick it through to the end that this one i did not make it through
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:30.400]  like my wife and i just looked each other's like let's just go to bed let's
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.520]  go sleep because otherwise i think i'm gonna
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.400]  fall asleep down here in front of this thing it was not funny
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:42.240]  but i still feel like you know we can't have our movies being held
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:47.120]  to the whims of you know anonymous nut job hackers yeah oh yeah
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.720]  totally you got to stick to your guns and i kind of feel like
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.880]  so as stupid as the movie itself actually is i kind of feel like
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.160]  it really was an exceptional situation that warranted
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.360]  probably exceptional and you know an exception from apple from what they
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.600]  would typically do right you know it it wasn't just like sony
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.000]  had called them up and they're like ah we had this movie from the summer
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.560]  and we've got it scheduled to come up with you guys on january 2nd
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.320]  but you know what it's like can we do it like a week early and maybe get it up on
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.040]  christmas and apple is like no you guys you know
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:26.160]  before you know your chance to do that was last week
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.920]  it's coming up on january 2nd this was not just like a regular
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.600]  situation like you said the president united states is talking about right
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.560]  right i mean i'm glad that it ended up back in theaters and it sounds like it
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.960]  was the theater chains were like we're afraid we don't
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.000]  want to scare people away from the other movies so we're just going to punt it
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.200]  i'm glad that that some theaters finally showed it
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.480]  and i'm glad that it was on vod and that people could watch it
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.000]  and yeah it's a shame in a way that this isn't over a
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.840]  a more serious thoughtful piece of work instead of a
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.880]  kind of stoner road comedy but and i you know i like franco and rogan i mean i
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.800]  like from all the way back in freaks and
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.280]  geeks days actually um and the fact that seth rogan is a guy
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.880]  who headlines movies is totally crazy for me
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.720]  because i mean look at that guy he's not a movie star and yet he is a movie star
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.280]  i love that and he's a writer who has become you
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.800]  know he was primarily a writer who has become more of an actor now i i have
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.360]  lots of positive thoughts about those guys even if their movie is kind of
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:26.720]  sucky um i'm glad that it got out there and
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.400]  yeah yeah you would think i don't know you
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.280]  would think somebody that would be like yeah guys i think we need to do this
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.320]  uh and and i think perhaps that did happen eventually
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.520]  after the fact where maybe on christmas day somebody was like why
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.960]  why are we not out there with this and so now we see it
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.280]  you know because it it went on itunes faster than i thought once it didn't go
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.280]  on itunes on the day of release i thought
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.840]  that's going to lag behind and they're going to come up and turn all the lights
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.920]  back on and then they're going to put it out there
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.120]  and it it got up there faster than i thought after
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.160]  after they passed by the initial drop date
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.080]  no it was exactly i did i would say it was exactly what i expected i read
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.720]  between the lines and my guess was all they said was we're not going to
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.040]  do this we're not going to get this up by christmas
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.840]  and that's it we'll get it in you know somebody will come back in on friday or
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.880]  monday and push the button yeah we'll make it happen yeah yeah stupid
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.200]  movie cannot really not i really cannot an
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.800]  yeah an international incident propelled by
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:32.720]  a uh a stoner road comedy it's amazing this is amazing world we live
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.720]  all right let me take a break and thank our third and final sponsor of the show
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.200]  and it's a trifecta of longtime friends of the show it's our good friends
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.400]  at hover
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:48.480]  hover as you may know is the world's best
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:54.800]  domain name registrar no junk no upsell no scams no
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.960]  hidden prices no hidden fees you go to hover you sign up for an account
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:05.680]  and you register domains and you get great service you get great technical
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.120]  support you get a great interface for searching
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.840]  for domains so like if you have like a couple of
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.760]  words you want to use dot com and it's taken they'll help you find
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.240]  other top level domains they'll help you find
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.520]  alternatives based on the words you're looking for really really
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.200]  really clever software for getting the domain name you want
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.760]  but the best thing they have i'm telling you this thing is amazing
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:38.320]  i've done it and it works great uh is the valet transfer service
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.440]  so you sign up for a hover account you've got domains at a bunch of other
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.880]  registrars from around the web that you've been registering since like
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:50.240]  the mid-90s if you give hover your login credentials
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.600]  to your old domain name registrars they'll take care of moving those all
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.160]  your old domains into your hover account so you'll have
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.960]  them all all your domains in one centralized location
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.200]  with their great interface their great support just one place to go to renew
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:13.280]  your domains for the rest of your life because it's such a hard thing dns is so
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:17.120]  easy to screw up and when you do screw it up it takes hours to fix because you
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.800]  got to wait for the changes to propagate and how often do regular people mess
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.520]  around with dns me almost never i kind of vaguely sort of
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.520]  ish know what it's like it's terrifying the valet transfer
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.560]  people at hover this is all they do all they do is
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:40.160]  live eat and breathe dns and domain name stuff so they're experts and they know
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.520]  all the ins and outs of all the other registrars and all the tricks that they
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.720]  have and stuff like that it's just an amazing
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:50.160]  amazing service and you don't pay extra for it it's just part of being
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.080]  a hover customer can you find a cheaper registrar than hover
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.120]  i guarantee it i guarantee you you can find cheaper ones
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:00.480]  but hover charges really fair prices good prices
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.640]  and gives you amazing value in return so if you have a new idea that you need a
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.400]  domain name for i'm telling you go to hover you're crazy if you don't
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:14.480]  if you've got domain names registered as any other registrar
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:18.800]  who's you're just not satisfied with sign up for hover and let them
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.480]  move them over and you will not regret it i have never met one person who's
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.800]  like wow i regret switching to hover no it's it's like the apple of domain name
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.480]  registrars it's just a cut above the rest

[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:00.160]  uh your account now i have 16 domains at hover
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:04.080]  i may have a problem but i do it and count yeah well i mean that's where i
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.960]  put all the when i when i got six colors that's where i put it
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.160]  is yeah see i was about to say i'm going to repeat myself but it couldn't it must
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.040]  have been something i told you in person because you haven't been on the show
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:17.680]  i think six colors is such a great name ah thanks
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.240]  when you came out with that you didn't ask me you didn't say hey john what you
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.840]  think of the name you didn't my feelings were a little hard but i
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.280]  think it's because you knew you had a home run
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:28.400]  yeah well that was i mean i expected a lot more hand-wringing and
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.640]  and difficulty honestly i i i did some brainstorming
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.720]  when i decided i was going to do this site and i thought
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:40.240]  i don't want it to be i something or mac something i'd already spent
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.640]  years dealing with a brand name with mac in it that was talking about ios
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.280]  and i also wanted the freedom to talk about other tech stuff that's not apple
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.520]  related at all but i also didn't want it to be just
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.000]  completely divorced i wanted i wanted it to mean something to me
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.960]  completely divorced from apple i was like well if i can tip my cap at apple
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.520]  somehow and yet have it not be necessary uh to understanding just have it be an
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.880]  easy to scan site uh site name that that was what i was
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.960]  looking for and i also wanted to be something that
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.920]  was kind of normal words and spellable and a dot com
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:10.960]  those were sort of all my rules because i did tv.net
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.080]  which was t-e-e v-e-e dot net and there's nothing worse than having to
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.640]  spell it out and then and then point out it's not a dot com
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.160]  it's a dot net and you know i just i want it to be simple and
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.280]  then that that struck me that classic um you know the it comes from the d
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.400]  interview that steve jobs did with walt and kara
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:32.080]  about uh when he came back to apple wrapping back around at the beginning of
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:36.400]  the show in in 96 97 and he was amazed at how many
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:39.920]  um good people were still there when he thought the company should be just
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.400]  empty because it was in such dire straits and
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.760]  and the phrase that struck him at the time was somebody told him
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:50.160]  or multiple people told him that uh you know we bleed six colors here
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:53.600]  or i bleed six colors that the classic apple rainbow logo
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.640]  which was the logo at the time it's like it's in my blood this is apple is part
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.440]  of who i am um and that struck steve it's like oh
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:02.640]  yeah bleeding six colors that makes sense you love apple like i love apple
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.600]  let's make some great stuff and i i felt like that was
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.240]  that was it it's like i'm not going to always praise everything apple does i'm
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.880]  going to criticize apple i'm going to try to be fair when i write about apple
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:14.080]  and i'm going to write about things that aren't apple but apple has defined my
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.480]  career in tech journalism there's no doubt about it
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.480]  and it would be crazy for me not to find a way to
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.840]  uh to reference that and so i thought you know bleed six
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.080]  six colors bleed six colors what you know let me look that up and i found out
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.200]  that there were no websites called that the dot com domain for it was available
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:37.200]  it was owned by somebody but it was just a site literally saying make me an offer
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.480]  and i thought oh well it's like and then i gave it a few days where i just
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.600]  thought maybe maybe not do i want to do this
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.840]  what do i want to do but i i never went to a backup name because i thought
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.560]  well this is great it doesn't say mac it doesn't say i it's a dot com it's
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:55.600]  regular english words and uh so yeah so then i ended up making
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.400]  making those people an offer and transferring it to hover and i bought
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:02.080]  six colors with a u for everybody in commonwealth countries
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.400]  it redirects to the one without the u it does it redirect or does it mirror it
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.080]  it redirects it and what i want to do at some point is write a script or
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.600]  something that mirrors it with um all of the words swapped out for their
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.360]  english equivalents but i haven't gotten to that point yet
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.720]  oh maybe that would be a good addition to smarty pants
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.560]  englishify like yeah put a monocle and a top hat on it
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.560]  um but yeah so it was i'm glad you like it i i mean i've gotten incredibly
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:31.280]  positive feedback from it which is which is great because you never expect
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.080]  positive feedback from anything on the internet you expect people to grouse
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  about it but i you know i've been i've been
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.480]  happy to have the people say nice things about it and uh yeah i'm happy about it
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.800]  i i was like i said i expected this to be a
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:47.680]  real trial and for me to get something that was a compromise because you hear
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.720]  those stories like marco tells a story about overcast and how he had all these
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.040]  different ideas and you know things he couldn't get and
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.360]  things that didn't pass pass a trademark search or anything like that and you
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.600]  know for this i was really just looking for a
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.200]  ideally a dot-com domain um i would have taken
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.480]  some others probably if i could have come up with something clever
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.360]  but um you know this for me was a good fit it's like if you get what it's
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.560]  referencing then great and if you don't it doesn't matter it's
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.520]  just it's just a brand i mean like daring fireball
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.880]  is uh it's a good name you know it's a good name
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.600]  it's but it's funny though because it's not enough to have a good name though
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.480]  because well i wonder about that today like i know
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:30.960]  like jason fried at uh base camp i was going to say 37 signals but
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.320]  i still always want to call them 37 i will for the rest of my life but
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.360]  he he's written about uh how domain names don't mean as much anymore
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.600]  and they have base camp.com now right um but for
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.200]  i think at least 10 years base camp hq hq
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.040]  everybody who used base camp knows that it was hq and his thing was
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:54.640]  look man people just google base camp you know and then what you know when
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.880]  they have an account they just start typing b
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:00.480]  in their auto you know in their address field and it fills in
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.000]  and when they're looking for it they don't
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.200]  go to the website they go to google and they type base camp and basically you
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:13.280]  know we could be base camp hq x f g and you know they would get to us
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:16.720]  so i do think it's a little bit less important i agree like it's better to
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:19.200]  have a good name that just sounds like a good name
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.960]  six colors it sounds good rather than worry about the domain but i still
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.320]  think that there's an art to getting a name where
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.240]  it looks like a good url you know and every once in a while it's like i'm
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.080]  trying to think of an example but like a lot of times when you have like an s in
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:38.320]  the middle it it if it's plural like
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:44.160]  sixes colors.com it's like you know you it doesn't look good it's like you you
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.720]  lose the two words you know you want if you're going to
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:50.080]  combine two words together like daring fireball or six colors
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.240]  you want it to be completely unambiguous even without camel case because that's
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:57.200]  how most people are going to see it and every once in a while you come up
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.680]  with a domain name it's like two words put together
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.440]  they sound great the meaning is great but then you look at them all lowercase
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.000]  together and it's like you can't read it i mean it's like
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.120]  we had a lot of politics involving picking a name for the site that we
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.840]  launched it at idg and we chose tech hive and
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.040]  there are a lot of things i love i love the logo i love the colors i like the
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.600]  name but in a browser it looks terrible
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.800]  because it's the two h's in the middle yeah that's a good perfect that's
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.640]  exactly the sort of thing i'm talking about yeah
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:25.760]  no but it again it did you know but that's
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.680]  two h's in a row it's it's exactly right whereas in
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:32.800]  if it wasn't for the url you would never it would never occur to you right
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.240]  because the eight the second h would always be uppercase and there'd be a
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.760]  they'd either be camel case or it would be two words with a space between them
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.720]  but either way it would be a lowercase h and a capital
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720]  h and it wouldn't be a problem oh i did get
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.720]  and i've never even used this it redirects but i did get six color
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:54.960]  dot rs because i don't know why not that's like serbian serbian
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.440]  domain registrar has some of my money now but
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:00.800]  i don't know i i bought a lot of domains when i was speculating about the about
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.680]  the name and that's why i have 16 domains in hover is i've got
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:07.680]  i've got bleed six colors and bleed six and i've got numeral
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.520]  six of something but not of six colors and and a few other names that were in
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.480]  there snell world which is where i posted my like sort of
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:17.920]  resignation announcement thing that was just a placeholder until i
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.160]  could launch six colors but um but yeah i i it's a name right
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.720]  it's a name with real words you don't have to explain it and daring
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.000]  fireball is like that i mean people might ask what does that mean
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.160]  but uh the words are recognizable it's an understandable concept and i think i
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.280]  think in the art of naming that's what you want is you want something that is
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:37.040]  going to catch a little bit and be like oh yeah
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:40.480]  because yeah even if the domain doesn't matter although quite frankly you're on
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.080]  a podcast or you're on a tv interview and somebody says oh where can people
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.720]  read about you it helps especially at the
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.720]  beginning to say sixcolors.com because you know if you say well here's a
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.920]  weird url you have to go to it's less likely anybody's going to
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:56.080]  remember it but they might remember the name
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.440]  did you get the digit six colors i didn't
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.560]  uh and i i would like to get that at some point but it was quite frankly it
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.040]  was too expensive after i bought the others i was like
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.920]  wow that's really pricey for just a reader act
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:11.840]  and to your point about google um i feel like after
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:16.000]  some amount of time of me doing this um i can decide whether i want to go ahead
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.200]  and buy that and my feeling is at some point those
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:23.040]  other alternatives are a lot less valuable because
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.280]  there's already a thing that is six colors dot com
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:29.040]  and so numeral six colors dot com is not a you know they're going to think well
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.160]  it's it's valuable if they can sell it to me but nobody else is going to want
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.880]  it so i hope to get them eventually but i'm
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.840]  not going to pay an arm and a leg to get them just because
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.680]  they'll redirect i've told this before when i registered during fireball i
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:45.040]  registered dot net and dot com at the same time and i
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:48.320]  i went with dot net as the canonical one because
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:52.800]  um i i've since grown out of it i guess if i had it to do all over again i'd
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.000]  probably use the dot com but at the time i had a weird aversion
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.280]  to dot coms i just thought i don't know this if it's inexplicable i
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:04.640]  cannot express it it just felt like dot com meant you were like a big company
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:07.920]  well there was a time when dot net was kind of cool it was like a cool like
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:11.840]  insidery um you know we're we're the techy people
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:15.680]  of the internet and we we have dot net we had i'd tv not net and dot org i just
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:19.840]  didn't ever get dot com yeah i don't know it just seemed to me
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:22.160]  like a person with a site should not have a dot com
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.400]  and i don't even know i've never even asked him i've always thought maybe
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:29.760]  that's why kotki uses kaki.org but i registered those two and this was
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.360]  back at a time when there were really only three big ones dot net dot com dot
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.240]  org and i didn't register dot org somebody
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.320]  else has it it's this guy peter has something if you go to daring
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:46.000]  fireball.org it's a guy who hosts his personal blog there i swear to god i
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.360]  swear it's crazy and i thought the dot org for six
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.400]  colors i've you know every once in a while
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:55.760]  somebody will write to me and point it to me and be like hey are you aware of
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.720]  this but it's like the guy he hasn't updated it's in two years so
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.800]  uh and it was never popular so i just thought it's not
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:08.880]  it's just not worth it i don't know why he did it it just seems to me like he's
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:11.920]  probably he must be some kind of crazy person it's also possible that his blog
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.360]  is somewhere else but he's parked he's parked that domain at the same ip
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.680]  address and it's just accepting all the all the traffic and so even though he's
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.840]  thinking that he's serving that at you know my
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.800]  my blog.peter.com it's also still serving at daring fireball.org i
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.040]  don't know that happens sometimes yeah for a while
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:35.360]  the guy who owns newspaper.com or at least he did own
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.680]  newspaper.com had it redirecting to daring fireball
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:44.800]  uh i didn't have it it wasn't my domain it was this the guy who had it and it's
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.800]  a you know i don't know newspaper.com is
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:51.840]  probably pretty valuable domain maybe it it no longer it still isn't a thing
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.600]  if you go to newspaper.com it's like a sorry we're down for the moment and
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.360]  there's an animation but for a while and it was just weird though
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.320]  because uh it was like i don't know it was
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:07.280]  enough traffic on a daily basis that it showed up in my referrals like i was
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:10.960]  like what the hell is this newspaper.com that is like my 15th highest referral
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.560]  and i went to it and it was daring fireball and i was like what
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.080]  and and oh and i oh the other thing was while he was doing it i would get i
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.560]  would get about one or two offers a month to buy it sure
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.760]  and i was like it's not me i was like i don't know why it's pointing to my site
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:29.040]  but it ain't me yeah i i remember there was a story about
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.160]  that i think maybe even a site i did had that for a while where
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:34.800]  somebody owned it and they didn't want to give it to us
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.840]  or sell it to us but they said but i'm not using it so i'll just redirect it to
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.560]  you for now i was like okay that's that doesn't
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:44.160]  really help me because i can't rely on it but it's nice that you turn
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.080]  the spigot on us for a while um you know the story with tv.com is
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.880]  that it was a it was a blog on cnet for a while and t-e-e-v-e
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.160]  i think it was no it wasn't even cnet it was like hotwired or something like that
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.280]  and i got a wired digital got sold to like
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.440]  lycos or altavista or something like that and it basically got sucked into
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.720]  this giant internet company to to the point where they were never
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.960]  using it if you visited that.com of my.net.org if you went to the.com you
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:16.800]  just went to the search engine home page and i spent years trying to get them
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.280]  to not even to sell it to me to find the person who is in charge of the domains
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.160]  at terasoft lycos whatever to this to this day i have no idea
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:29.440]  just give me somebody to talk to yeah because you know we just have this blog
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.400]  you're not using it it was the name of a blog on a website
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.920]  that you bought 10 years ago they only did 10 posts or whatever and
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.160]  then and then they shut it down and to this day if you go to t-e-e-v-e.com
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:46.880]  you end up at insiderinfo.com at the lycos network
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:53.120]  which uh yeah with with a form submission of src equals
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.200]  nm domains i wonder if that's like all of our dead domains
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:02.960]  just redirect to this page where they uh where they uh i don't even know what
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:06.160]  it's like a user submitted content or something like that so they're renting
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.520]  out all these old domains but it's like that they just
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.360]  they got that domain domains are funny they got that domain a million years ago
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:16.160]  and they just keep paying whatever they're paying as part of the thousand
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.200]  domains that they own and will pay for it forever and
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.160]  you know that's always the problem when you're shopping for domains is is that
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:26.240]  is that if it's somebody wants to sell it it's great but
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.960]  if it's just inside the maw of a giant corporation forget it you just
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.520]  forget it t-v t-e-e-v-e you see the problem here
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:40.480]  dot com dot com yeah it just redirects to like some kind of
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.520]  weird site but dot net and dot org you know we we still have
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:46.320]  actually and that was that was my you know that was the tv blog that my
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:51.360]  friends and i did for for like 96 to i don't even know when
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.600]  sometime in the 2000s ends up lycos is still a thing i guess so
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:59.040]  or again there's a company that swallowed lycos that owns the
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:02.560]  the assets and including all those domains that they bought and they still
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.320]  run it and no i just went there they still
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:09.120]  operates as a search engine wow yeah i have not thought of lycos it's
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:13.280]  amazing it's amazing and it may even be powered by somebody else but it's it's
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:16.240]  it's still there so you can still go there and get search
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.040]  results nice so i'm sure they're really good i wonder if their search results
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:23.600]  from the 90s that'd be funny i searched for jason
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.040]  snell and it redirected me to snell world so well that's not bad
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:31.120]  they're up to date that's not bad i was uh at my mom's house and she found a
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:34.640]  uh thing i did at mac user again bringing it back around
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.600]  called the internet road map and it was like literally
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.560]  this uh this subscription premium i think or maybe it's a newsstand premium
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:45.280]  it was like a road map except it was of sites on the internet
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.640]  and they were all interconnected and it was actually a project we did where we
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:52.400]  went from site to site with links each site had to link to the next site
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:58.000]  in a chain and it is crazy um but the the funny thing about it is
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.400]  that the backbone of that that we used to really make it functional was yahoo
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.840]  at stanford when they were the just a like a link directory and we would use
[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:10.960]  that to link out to the sites and literally they were like 150 sites on
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:16.000]  the map and it was most of the internet in 1995 or whenever that was
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.560]  um so old i i had to look this up i actually looked it up through licos
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:22.800]  okay um but talking about domain name forget
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:26.800]  it duck duck go like us where it's at now it's a classic
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.120]  mcswiney's article you had to have seen this
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:34.960]  from 2004 written by uh michael ward and its email addresses it would be really
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:38.640]  annoying to give out over the phone
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:44.000]  and it's it's it's much more of a visual joke than a verbal joke because of the
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.280]  nature of the email addresses but it's like for example
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:54.960]  imagine if your surname were underscore mike underscore 2004
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:07:00.320]  yahoo.com uh i'll just put it in the show notes
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.360]  the rest of these i don't want to spoil it but it's a funny little uh
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:07.920]  five item list gag i'll put it in the show notes
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.920]  i've started doing more show notes that's good i don't know if
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.160]  people i don't know if you've noticed yeah it's i i used to be really lazy
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.960]  about it but i feel like it's one of the little things that can do to make the
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.440]  show a little better well you know people are in their cars
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:24.080]  and they hear about something that's going to be interesting
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:27.200]  and then they you know get to work and they forget and they're like oh yeah
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:31.760]  what was that thing and it's hard to look back at at you
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:34.640]  know scan through two hours of podcast when
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.480]  you can just go to the show notes and be like oh
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:38.720]  yeah that's the thing i was looking for it's like it's like you're pre
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:43.120]  instapapering the show for them i think yeah exactly and it's a pain i mean it
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:47.520]  it's totally a pain but um i as if you do it as you go along it's a
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.360]  little bit easier i've started to do that with
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:53.520]  incomparable and with clockwise mike does it for upgrade but
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.880]  um you know just somebody mentioned something and i just write it down
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:59.600]  it's like and it's a pain to do that because it gets you a little bit out of
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:03.600]  the flow of your concentration of the of the conversation but at the same time
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.920]  it kind of beats having to go back later and say where did they mention something
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.000]  and you know and people do like it people
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.400]  appreciate it when you add those links in
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:16.320]  um i had renee on lat on the last episode
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:20.480]  and i think he he even wrote on i'm more that he was on over 300 podcasts last
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:23.280]  year and i knew i already had already asked
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:27.360]  you to do the next episode i do think i've gotten back to back the
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.520]  two most prolific podcasters and on the mac web how many
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:35.600]  podcasts do you think you do a year oh man um and you're probably doing more
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:39.920]  now so maybe a better question is how many are you on pace to do yeah
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.680]  i don't know mike hurley probably has me beat um or it's close
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:47.280]  i would say if i keep doing what i've been doing now
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.920]  next year uh let me do i'm gonna do some launch bar math here
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:09:00.400]  um let's see i'd say oh man 250
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.080]  so you're at ballpark right i mean we're talking like if somebody wanted to
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.800]  listen to every show that you're on every show that renee's on they're
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:11.920]  talking 500 episodes a year yeah i mean it it goes it goes uh it goes
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.160]  fast and i don't expect anybody to be a completist but yeah so i basically i'm
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:19.680]  doing four weekly podcasts um i'm not the
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:23.360]  center of all four um i mean i do the one with tim
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:26.240]  goodman from the hollywood reporter and we talk about tv because he's the tv
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.600]  critic at the hollywood reporter and i'm the i'm kind of the classic dan
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.040]  benjamin role in that where i'm facilitating it and producing it and
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.000]  posting it and really it's like i'm asking questions of
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.600]  the guy who's the expert on tv because he's tv critic of the hollywood
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.560]  reporter that's a very different kind of show to do than
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.640]  incomparable or like clockwise is just a half an hour and it's me and dan moran
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.960]  and then upgrade is me a lot of me but mike produces that one so you know
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.000]  each of them takes a little bit of a different amount of time but yeah if
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.360]  you put those together and multiply them by 52 that's 208
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.040]  podcasts right there and then there are some others that are
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:04.480]  like i did uh i did a podcast after every episode of
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:08.400]  game of thrones last year and dot or this year and doctor who as well and so
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.400]  that that's an extra like 23 episodes and then uh we do our
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.400]  little don't and those were under the those were under the incomparable those
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:20.960]  were the flashcasts were under uh tv actually tv
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.360]  i'm reusing the names and the logos i think if you just pronounce it t
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:30.560]  tv yeah tv um longies anyway we put it there
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.600]  because i i i don't know i i'm torn i could
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.120]  basically have like five podcasts a week in the main incomparable feed and i
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.520]  feel like that's that would be litter so there's like a
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:42.320]  master feed with everything and then you can just subscribe to the individual
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.360]  podcast if you want to um and then we do the dungeons and
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:48.320]  dragons thing which is literally we play dungeons and dragons once every six
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.520]  weeks for like four hours and then that comes out every other week
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.480]  in a one hour chunk so it's not a lot of time
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.400]  um and it's fun but that is another podcast that i'm on
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:01.760]  and then i say yes to be on other people's podcasts like this one so
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.840]  it's a lot there's a lot of podcasting we'll see how how how long i last i wish
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.960]  podcasting was more like aerobic exercise because i i could really use
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.200]  some more exercise and instead i'm just doing a lot of
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.360]  podcasting i'd be very healthy if uh podcasting was
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.680]  uh more aerobic than it is i've been dreading this the whole time
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.320]  i've been putting off the end of the show but i feel like i've got to run it
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.360]  by it almost an apology is that i've got one
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:28.320]  more episode of the talk show scheduled for
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.680]  2014 and it's it's going to be a special
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:36.960]  episode on star wars oh and and i it
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.000]  it i didn't invite you that's okay i know i know
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.080]  i know i i forgive you i know way more i i know so many huge star wars fans
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.360]  and i am not i'm not one of those i i like star wars a lot
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.400]  and i'm happy to talk we talked about it on incomparable a million times for
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.600]  millions of hours and syracuse and dan moran and i did
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:59.120]  an out more than an hour on the trailer for the force awakens right
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.640]  but you know in in even in our sphere i could list off a whole bunch of people
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.680]  who are bigger star wars fans than than me including you
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:10.000]  and and john syracuse and dan moran now it's going to be me it's going to be
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.440]  syracuse and uh and then to keep us straight and
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.360]  sort of and sort of keep us from getting too
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.640]  serious guy english oh that's good oh that's that's perfect
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.720]  i love i love well my thing is i feel like i
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.760]  i cannot be responsible i can't be the host
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.920]  for more than uh a panel of three including me
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:35.280]  because it's it's it's beyond my ken as a as a host that would also be like
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.560]  eight hours long if if yeah if you were just completely
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.000]  just free to talk about star wars that's the
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.360]  that's i i i've i don't know if i said this before but i'm going to mention it
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.960]  here because i'm not sure i've said it anywhere
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.640]  one of my favorite moments in waiting in line for an apple keynote ever
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:53.840]  was uh you and me and i think like dan moran
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.320]  and i'm not sure syracuse was there because i think it was the press area
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.560]  before wwc and we were talking about raiders of
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.720]  the lost ark for like 20 minutes and there was that moment when the doors
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.520]  started to accordion up and you looked at me and you're like
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.040]  forget this let's just go talk about raiders the lost ark some more
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:12.480]  that was good stuff that was that was i almost took you up on it it's like yeah
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.680]  that would be fun but well that was the incomparable i did
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.040]  the i did the incomparable then yes raiders right yeah yeah that was you and
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.520]  me and dan talking about it yeah i have to do one of
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.080]  those again sometime uh you know on something uh something that you that
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.640]  you really like that uh that we could cover because that
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.960]  was it that was a good one and one of the
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.000]  i still hear from people who listen to that one partially they're like oh john
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.080]  grouper was on the incomparable i should listen to that
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:40.240]  but the whole goal of that show from the beginning was uh it's a catalog show you
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:43.440]  should be able to go back to 2010 when we recorded that one and
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.000]  listen i mean raiders of the lost ark isn't any different
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.600]  it's it you know it's it's fixed in time and you should be able to go and pick
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:52.400]  that episode off the shelf and listen to it and get something out of it
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.040]  you know and i think you can um and i that was always the intent and i'm happy
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.200]  that you know four plus years later um that that's still true that's that's
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:03.760]  still one of my favorites because it's one of my favorite movies in fact i look
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:06.560]  back and i think boy we should have gone for like two or three hours on that not
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:09.520]  just one yeah exactly i think it was when we had
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.120]  an artificial time i was shooting for an hour yeah
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.240]  uh i always want i always want you say it hasn't changed and isn't going to
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:18.640]  change i always imagine in the back of my head
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:23.200]  that like every monday spielberg comes into the office at amblin
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:26.560]  and there's like a stack of like three pink slips that say
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:30.320]  george george lucas call the ones that wants to talk
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:33.440]  raiders of the lost ark special edition and he just
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.200]  he just picks them off the spike puts them in the trash can
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.240]  that's yeah no i mean it's actually bad enough that the
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:44.000]  packaging is now labeled indiana jones and the raiders of the lost ark which is
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.040]  just unacceptable yeah george called he had an idea the
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:52.640]  boulder could be on fire yeah that would be much better let's
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:58.800]  insert a scene in cgi where belloq is already in egypt
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:03.760]  george called he had an idea there's a whole fleet of airplanes waiting on the
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.360]  river not just one yeah instead of traveling across the map
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:13.200]  they travel across a 3d globe that'll be good did you see somebody
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.120]  put together a special edition of the force awakens
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:20.560]  trailer yeah oh yeah yeah i did and they did like a killer i
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.760]  should i have to put that in the show notes they did like a killer job like
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.000]  somebody actually who knows what they're doing like with
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.120]  vfx like and yeah it's just more like more buzzing
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:38.960]  junk and tattooing and yeah i mean it is uh well like the
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.800]  it it's only funny because it's not even an exaggeration because it's exactly the
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.160]  sort of stuff that did happen in the special edition of the star wars movies
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.360]  but like there's the scene where you see all of a sudden you see the millennium
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.600]  falcon yeah and it's like being chased by like
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:56.560]  three tie fighters well now it's being chased by 45
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.040]  it's more exciting that way clearly
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:05.120]  anyway so everybody out there if you want to if you're listening to this this
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:07.360]  show will air first and then the star wars
