[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Do you watch football?
[00:04.080 --> 00:07.240]  Kind of. I know you're a basketball guy. I know you're an NBA guy.
[00:09.200 --> 00:14.520]  Football, like I like the idea of
[00:15.520 --> 00:19.620]  You know like I'm gonna like boycott football because it's like killing people yeah
[00:19.920 --> 00:23.040]  And I can be all self-righteous about it and say well
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.540]  I don't watch I don't watch football
[00:24.540 --> 00:28.920]  The problem is that the main reason I watch football is because it's on in the middle of the night
[00:28.920 --> 00:34.080]  And I find football of all the sports the least amenable to watching not live
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.040]  Which is weird because if you watch it not live you can watch it in like 30 minutes, right?
[00:40.840 --> 00:47.200]  But because I know when I came to Taiwan the first time I like there weren't really any streaming things
[00:47.200 --> 00:49.000]  It was much more difficult to do then
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.640]  And then when I went back for four years
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.320]  I was right back right right right back on the couch on Sunday after dudes
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.480]  So I know I'd be a bit. I'm I'm kind of a big hypocrite about it, so I do watch some
[00:59.480 --> 01:05.100]  I do watch it some I actually got the NFL package this year, but I'm terribly conflicted about it
[01:05.100 --> 01:09.440]  But it's such. It's I mean you know it is so compelling so did you watch the Super Bowl I?
[01:10.240 --> 01:12.880]  Did I did and were you able to watch it live?
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.380]  Yeah, I I have the the NFL streaming
[01:18.800 --> 01:23.520]  Thing which it actually includes all the commercials and all that sort of stuff, so I was
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.520]  able to offer side remarks along with the rest of Twitter I
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.000]  Feel the same way about you. I forget if I've talked about this on the show before I
[01:33.560 --> 01:34.760]  Know I've linked to it
[01:34.760 --> 01:41.160]  And I know cocky has to that it's like the NFL is so incredibly popular in the United States
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.400]  And it's if anything more popular than it ever was especially compared to other team sports
[01:46.720 --> 01:52.040]  But yet it really does seem like the sport as we know it is completely doomed ought to be doomed
[01:52.040 --> 01:59.020]  And I do feel as it's like a semi-casual fan somebody who doesn't really watch as many games as I used to I
[01:59.200 --> 02:01.880]  Do I actually feel like a like a complicit?
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.920]  It's like a guilt that this the game as configured is you know literally killing people and and you know giving them
[02:10.280 --> 02:15.040]  And not just kill you know, but then you know making the last years of their life absolutely miserable with this
[02:16.040 --> 02:18.040]  chronic traumatic and
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.640]  Cephalopathy CTE in other words though long story short for anybody who doesn't follow football there is massive evidence
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.800]  I mean just overwhelming evidence like
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.280]  Smoking is bad for your lungs and gives you cancer evidence that playing football
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.120]  Even at like a high school level even if you just play in high school
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.320]  And then never play again
[02:39.320 --> 02:44.240]  But let alone if you go on to play college where people hit you harder and then go on to a pro career where bigger
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.440]  People hit you even harder for more years that the the repeated hits to your head
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.520]  End up causing terrible scarring that your brain is not meant to have and it causes you know depression and all sorts of other problems
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.360]  It's a really nasty nasty degenerative brain disease, and if it really seems like it's you know
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.760]  It's just unbelievable how many former pro football players have it right and that's that's the thing that um
[03:10.760 --> 03:15.360]  It's easy to say well these guys know what they're doing. They're gonna pay millions of dollars. That's the trade-off
[03:15.360 --> 03:21.080]  They make but the problem is that oh, you know like any pro sport only a very small fraction of
[03:21.680 --> 03:29.380]  People playing actually you know make money from it and when you you know basically start banging your head from the time
[03:29.380 --> 03:31.160]  You're a kid on
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.840]  That's you know. There's a lot of people that aren't that aren't winning that trade-off to say the least
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.560]  And there were a couple of concussions in the Super Bowl. I'm reading an article here. This is
[03:44.040 --> 03:51.000]  Panthers wide receiver Corey Brown suffered concussion and Broncos linebacker Shaquille Barrett. I forget his name
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.200]  I thought number 88 for the Broncos clearly had a concussion
[03:54.200 --> 04:00.280]  He got like his clock cleaned in an early play and then later like the next time he ran a route
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.960]  He just felt held out. I hate to laugh, but it really I
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.400]  Don't know it and then just to have the word concussion mentioned during the game
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.080]  You just know that the NFL there's somebody the NFL is like
[04:12.080 --> 04:18.160]  I was really hoping to get through this game without that word coming up. Yep, but it's not just I mean
[04:18.160 --> 04:20.680]  That's the serious one, but I mean there's also I mean
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.320]  What what these people with these guys are doing to their to their bodies? I mean you have I
[04:27.120 --> 04:30.480]  Mean like what was it Ben Ben Roethlisberger in the playoffs?
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.000]  Dislocated his throwing arm and somehow managed to come in
[04:36.080 --> 04:38.080]  You know as few series later in play
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.720]  You know
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.280]  Just just I I don't think it magically healed itself in the meantime
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.020]  You know, there was like some horse tranquilizers being used or something like that. I mean
[04:49.680 --> 04:55.120]  Who knows what they're these guys are shooting themselves up with for for our our entertainment
[04:55.120 --> 05:01.960]  And yeah, it's it's definitely it's it's one of those things that it's it's hard to think a lot about my theory
[05:01.960 --> 05:06.840]  And I've said I think I've written this on during for but my theory is that the way the long-term way out is for football
[05:06.840 --> 05:08.320]  to
[05:08.320 --> 05:11.860]  evolve into a more basketball like game that is mostly
[05:12.800 --> 05:20.240]  you know more or less like professional flag football, but it's mostly like quarterbacks and wide receivers and athletic passing plays and
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.920]  defensive guys, you know who can counter that but
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.320]  I've because I feel like that's the part of the game that I like best
[05:28.320 --> 05:33.760]  I love the passing game and I love you know, some of the just incredible athleticism of you know
[05:34.100 --> 05:37.100]  Catching a ball at full speed while you're running 50 yards down a field
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.720]  But I feel like there's way way too much of the popularity is tied up in the glad II
[05:42.640 --> 05:43.720]  gladiatorial
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.200]  Aspect of the violence, you know that I say this and I might enjoy watching that game and I like watching basketball
[05:49.200 --> 05:51.680]  but that the reason the sport is so popular has
[05:52.660 --> 05:55.480]  Way too much to do with the actual brutal violence
[05:56.240 --> 06:02.400]  Yeah, I think that whether that's part of it too. And the other thing too is I think part of what makes football so compelling is
[06:03.280 --> 06:09.000]  Is like it really is such a strategic sort of game tied into you know
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.920]  So much violence and and part of that strategy is very much a sort of war of attrition
[06:13.920 --> 06:20.240]  Aspect like you you like you do stuff in the first quarter like you you run plays that achieve no gain
[06:20.880 --> 06:26.480]  in part to with the express purpose of wearing down the defense so that you can you know
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.500]  Pull off those plays, you know later in the game and like just I mean the fundamental nature of it is so tied into
[06:33.400 --> 06:35.020]  You know like
[06:35.020 --> 06:37.020]  getting a physical advantage
[06:37.020 --> 06:44.220]  That yeah, it's I mean and the other thing too is the trend I what you say makes sense intellectually
[06:44.220 --> 06:51.580]  But the actual trend of the game is yes as right guys getting bigger and stronger and faster and hitting right
[06:51.580 --> 06:59.120]  I fully acknowledge the wistful wishful thinking aspect of my make it more like flag football and a basketball type
[06:59.120 --> 07:07.120]  Athletic game I fully acknowledge that it really contrasts and is in the opposite direction of what is actually going on with the league
[07:07.120 --> 07:09.920]  What did they say they said the one of the most interesting stats?
[07:10.640 --> 07:15.040]  So there was they were making a big celebration about the fact that this was Super Bowl 50 and it's a nice round number
[07:16.080 --> 07:21.240]  Cam Newton the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers is 6 5 and
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.840]  245 pounds
[07:23.840 --> 07:32.040]  He he's bigger than every single player who is on the championship Green Bay Packers team from Super Bowl one
[07:32.960 --> 07:34.960]  the quarterback
[07:35.600 --> 07:40.040]  The quarterback was bigger than everybody on a legendary
[07:40.880 --> 07:47.080]  Legendarily great and and sort of rough-and-tough big, you know running, you know, three yards and a cloud of dust
[07:47.640 --> 07:49.640]  Green Bay Packers team
[07:49.640 --> 07:54.400]  It's kind of unbelievable. Yeah, it is unbelievable. Yeah, I thought and and again
[07:54.400 --> 07:59.720]  I think part of what makes football so appealing too is that the strategy is is very easily
[07:59.960 --> 08:06.760]  Apparent to the lathe layperson fan that specific tactics aren't right like the exact nature of what?
[08:06.960 --> 08:09.960]  the precision of the play and the complexity of a given play is
[08:10.400 --> 08:14.360]  You know, obviously it's if you've ever seen like the size of an NFL playbook
[08:14.360 --> 08:16.880]  Although I guess now they're all the size of a surface tablet
[08:16.880 --> 08:22.000]  But back when they were in a you're on brand back when they were in a binder
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.760]  They were just like phone book size
[08:23.760 --> 08:28.360]  But the you know the there it's complex tactics and very simple strategy
[08:28.360 --> 08:32.360]  And I thought the Super Bowl really this Super Bowl was a perfect example of it. Yep
[08:33.520 --> 08:40.480]  Yeah, no, it's I mean we're we're we're I don't know if this is better or worse than baseball baseball talk
[08:40.480 --> 08:45.560]  But um, it's you got to talk about the Super Bowl. Yeah. No, it was um
[08:45.560 --> 08:52.400]  You know, I I'm so I'm so it it's it's so one of those things. I mean, it's a perfect example of
[08:54.360 --> 08:56.440]  You know
[08:56.440 --> 09:04.420]  It's a reminder of about standing in judgment on everyone about on anything to anyone because I've there's no question
[09:04.420 --> 09:09.020]  I'm a total hypocrite and I like to say I'm less of hypocrite because I don't watch that many games or something like that
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.960]  But then actually that's just a matter of circumstance by being honest with myself. Yeah, if you want to think about it
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.840]  Here's the long-term the long-term
[09:16.840 --> 09:24.920]  Pessimist strategy about the NFL and football in general the NFL from the top down at the professional level is a they're very successful
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.080]  They're and they're very effective, you know, like in terms of PR and they have good lawyers
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.720]  I mean, I mean they've got effectively their lawyers are so good
[09:31.720 --> 09:37.480]  They've gotten everybody who doesn't pay them a fortune to refer to the game as the big game instead of the Super Bowl
[09:37.480 --> 09:39.640]  I know that was crazy. It's
[09:39.640 --> 09:47.220]  It's absolutely nuts how bad or not bad but how effective they are at having gotten rid of anybody using those
[09:47.360 --> 09:51.760]  the two words Super Bowl without paying them and it just shows how
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.760]  Unbelievable the brand is for the Super Bowl that they want to do that right like most like the NBA
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.760]  I don't think the NBA Finals is so
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.780]  Or the World Series is anywhere near as as
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.860]  Litigious about that because they want people talking about the World Series or they want people talking about the finals
[10:07.860 --> 10:12.540]  Or is the Super Bowl the NFL is like we know you're talking about the Super Bowl. So you're gonna pay us for those words
[10:14.700 --> 10:18.980]  No, I think it's from the bottom up where the game collapses which is that
[10:19.980 --> 10:24.140]  High schools and youth leagues are gonna start getting sued more and more
[10:25.060 --> 10:29.820]  And I feel like lawyers and insurance companies are gonna start telling
[10:29.820 --> 10:33.640]  I don't know if this is like a next few years thing or if it's a ten years from now thing
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.160]  But I think it's absolutely within the next 15 years that you know insurance companies are going to start telling schools
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.600]  We you can't have a football team. Yep, and
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.520]  More and more even without that I think you've got more and more parents who are saying to their athletic
[10:52.220 --> 10:54.880]  Children and let's just face it quite frankly their sons
[10:54.880 --> 11:01.000]  I mean, there's obviously, you know, there's a few girls who play here and there but it's usually quite notable, you know
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.800]  You
[11:02.800 --> 11:04.200]  Can't play football, you know
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.600]  You're gonna play soccer in the fall and basketball in the winter and you can play baseball in the spring
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.520]  But you're not playing football
[11:10.520 --> 11:13.920]  And I think with good reason I don't I don't think I would let my kid play
[11:14.280 --> 11:16.560]  In fact, I know I wouldn't definitely wouldn't let him play football
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.400]  And I think it's gonna happen more and more and you start hearing it now from football players like Troy Aikman
[11:23.400 --> 11:25.400]  I said he wouldn't let his kids play football
[11:25.400 --> 11:34.080]  And once that starts happening and fewer and fewer athletic kids even play football the kids who are who are the
[11:34.520 --> 11:40.560]  Extraordinary athletes who might go pro are gonna end up in different leagues. You know, they're gonna end up pitching in baseball or playing basketball
[11:42.080 --> 11:45.180]  Maybe well, maybe we'll finally have a have a good US soccer team
[11:45.180 --> 11:50.440]  I mean not that we have another team, but you know, we get if we get the the best athletes, all right
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.380]  I'm on board with that. The other thing too is because the football is such a
[11:54.380 --> 12:00.540]  You American sport like unlike baseball has lost a lot of particularly in like the inner cities
[12:00.860 --> 12:05.700]  And certain parts of the country baseball has really fallen off, but it's been
[12:06.540 --> 12:10.300]  From Latin America in particular. There's been a huge influx of talent
[12:10.300 --> 12:15.020]  That is that is really, you know picked up pick up the pace, but football is not gonna have that
[12:15.340 --> 12:20.460]  And so once once it loses the the American pipeline, that's that's the only pipeline
[12:20.460 --> 12:26.260]  Yeah, I think the long-term path is that it devolves into a regional sport in the u.s. South
[12:27.260 --> 12:28.980]  Yep
[12:28.980 --> 12:30.980]  Curious nice plays out
[12:31.340 --> 12:36.380]  It's it's um, I mean it is a mate amazing how
[12:37.260 --> 12:40.680]  Popular and pervasive it is. I mean even on something like, you know, like
[12:41.220 --> 12:45.560]  Detect circles that we we tend to you know, live in and circulate in
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.420]  I mean, there's a lot of football fans far more than than basketball or baseball or any other sport, you know every Sunday
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.220]  You know, even if you only follow tech people on Twitter and you know
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.860]  All the people are gonna complain about this podcast
[12:56.860 --> 13:01.220]  You know are I'm sure are are grimacing because they know exactly what I'm talking about
[13:01.620 --> 13:06.900]  But everyone's talking about the the play and and what's going on. It's it's really quite remarkable
[13:06.900 --> 13:11.620]  I still think but in that Super Bowl just has this weird gravity. I mean, it really does and I know it's corny
[13:11.620 --> 13:15.440]  It's almost a cliche that people say well, I'll just watch it for the commercials, but it's true
[13:15.440 --> 13:18.300]  And cuz people have parties, you know, I mean somebody says hey come over to my house
[13:18.300 --> 13:20.620]  I'm having a dozen people over we're gonna have you know
[13:21.860 --> 13:24.740]  You know big platters of food and lots of beer
[13:25.860 --> 13:30.160]  People come over and if you're not really into the game you take your bathroom breaks when the game comes back on, you know
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.980]  Yep, well a lot of those commercials this year were awful. I
[13:35.700 --> 13:39.340]  Don't know if you got the same commercials that we did. No, I did. I got all the same commercials
[13:39.340 --> 13:44.660]  I mean, I think they they're usually always awful. It's it's this weird sort of um
[13:45.460 --> 13:46.980]  Every year it's the worst year ever
[13:46.980 --> 13:52.140]  and then but it's just one of those things the one that stuck out to me the most was
[13:53.380 --> 13:59.580]  The one for diarrhea medicine where the star of the commercial was a walking human bowel
[14:01.380 --> 14:03.380]  Abdominal pain
[14:03.380 --> 14:09.500]  Yeah, they made a CGI human bowel with eyes and little legs and he's at the game
[14:10.020 --> 14:15.080]  And he's he's got diarrhea and the line to the bathroom is too long
[14:15.080 --> 14:18.340]  And now he doesn't know what to do because he's about to
[14:19.540 --> 14:25.780]  Wait doesn't have pants. He's not gonna he's not gonna shoot his pants. I guess he's just gonna go all over the floor
[14:26.900 --> 14:31.000]  Like where's what do you well made it even funnier is that was the second?
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  That was the second
[14:35.800 --> 14:40.920]  There was already one for constipation in the first half right they had a constipation one in the first half
[14:41.580 --> 14:46.600]  With the guy walking around watching people poop, but he saw a dog poopy on the street
[14:46.600 --> 14:52.740]  All right whimsical if you need an opioid to manage your chronic pain you may be so constipated
[14:53.540 --> 14:58.140]  It feels like everyone can go except you and he was jealous
[14:58.140 --> 15:01.620]  No, he was it was like a dog was enjoying a nice
[15:02.380 --> 15:09.100]  Nice nice dropping. It's like I used to be like that. He's like like some old man watching the youngins, right?
[15:09.100 --> 15:11.740]  I remember when I could enjoy a nice crap
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.420]  Boy those were the days
[15:15.420 --> 15:19.100]  There's not a good ad not a fun ad longing for a change
[15:19.100 --> 15:28.060]  Have the conversation with your doctor about oh, I see and ask about prescription treatment options. I
[15:28.060 --> 15:33.580]  Don't know like, you know, and it just followed right up by just you know, here's some kids having fun with a coke. Oh
[15:36.380 --> 15:38.380]  My god
[15:40.340 --> 15:45.600]  Real one so speaking of the Super Bowl the other tie-in to to our usual beat is
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.400]  Tim Cook was at the Super Bowl and I'm sure you saw this right that
[15:52.480 --> 15:54.040]  The so
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.440]  The game is over. I guess he had really good seeds look like he had like sideline seeds, you know
[15:58.440 --> 16:00.760]  I know he was in a box. I saw some photos later
[16:01.520 --> 16:09.080]  The photo so what happened is the game is over Tim Cook decides to tweet Congrats to the the championship Denver Broncos
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.120]  and he took a picture of like the celebration on the field like fireworks going off and and
[16:13.120 --> 16:16.320]  You know the on I don't know how that happens
[16:16.320 --> 16:21.240]  But like at the Super Bowl when the game is over there's seemingly like 1,500 people who stormed the field
[16:22.280 --> 16:24.280]  So pandemonium on the field
[16:25.360 --> 16:30.280]  And he posts a photo to Twitter and it's you know, it's not a great photo
[16:30.280 --> 16:36.960]  It's dark and it's blurry and I mean dark meaning like it's nighttime there and there was they turn the lights down
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.120]  So you could see the fireworks and so there's camera blur because it's you know
[16:41.120 --> 16:43.120]  There's not enough light to take a sharp picture
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.980]  It I you know and then and then he got
[16:47.880 --> 16:50.000]  Excoriated on Twitter it seemed like you know
[16:50.000 --> 16:57.680]  And and people in the press were picking up on writing stories that Tim Cook took a terrible photo at the Super Bowl
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.280]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there was there was you know
[17:03.880 --> 17:08.440]  Exploited perfectly fine reasons for it to be blurry. I thought it was I thought it's pretty hilarious
[17:08.440 --> 17:16.480]  The the virgin like Casey Newton at the verge had a funny post talk about people being mean mean to mean to Tim Cook
[17:16.480 --> 17:20.440]  And I think he sees a disease for his opening paragraph, which was hilarious and super mean
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.920]  But I mean whatever if you're if you're if you're the if you're a Tim Cook, I think you can deal
[17:27.760 --> 17:31.060]  Okay, so he ended up deleting the tweet
[17:31.760 --> 17:34.720]  Right and then he posted a much better picture a few minutes later
[17:34.720 --> 17:38.160]  But people still were making jokes
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.480]  I guess the joke everyone to make was they were sticking his photo is buried sort of a little slightly up
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.400]  not quite squared up photo into
[17:47.760 --> 17:50.300]  Shot with iPhone 6 billboards. Yes
[17:51.160 --> 17:57.000]  Yes, that's exactly it. I got an email. Here's in the actual actual email from an actual
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.320]  Actual reader I will not mention his name. No subject, of course
[18:03.320 --> 18:05.320]  this
[18:05.880 --> 18:12.520]  Is the entire email I got from a daring fireball reader not a word about the shitty photo you are a pig
[18:15.920 --> 18:17.920]  Doesn't even mention Tim Cook
[18:17.920 --> 18:20.380]  That's all email not a word about the shitty photo
[18:21.160 --> 18:26.520]  Return return you are a pig. So I just wrote back to him and said your message made my day. Thank you
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.560]  That was that was graceful of you I like to pretend when I get an email like that
[18:32.560 --> 18:38.800]  I like to pretend that I just answer every email as though it's I love your website and it's the best thing
[18:38.800 --> 18:39.760]  I've read all day
[18:39.760 --> 18:45.960]  It's my first thing I read every day and that's exactly how I write back to the people who write something like that. I
[18:47.160 --> 18:48.800]  thought
[18:48.800 --> 18:50.160]  that
[18:50.160 --> 18:51.920]  it I
[18:51.920 --> 18:58.680]  Wonder what happened. I kind of I like the idea that that Tim Cook sometimes tweets like that
[18:58.680 --> 19:05.280]  Just like a normal person right like, you know, he's excited. He's a sports fan. He's at the Super Bowl
[19:06.240 --> 19:08.880]  He takes a picture. He's not a professional photographer
[19:09.600 --> 19:14.920]  Whatever however much you want to praise the iPhone 6. I don't know what he's probably what do you think?
[19:14.920 --> 19:17.080]  He is a 6x. I think he's a plus guy. I
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.440]  Know idea I wonder well, it's a 50-50 chance easy
[19:22.440 --> 19:26.720]  They got the success or the success plus if he had the pull probably the six because it doesn't matter
[19:26.720 --> 19:30.280]  It's right. Maybe that's what he maybe he needs the image stabilization
[19:30.280 --> 19:38.160]  but either way even with the image stabilization as fine as the camera as it is and arguably easily arguably the best of any cell phone and
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.520]  Inarguably among the best of any phone. I think that's fair to say
[19:44.120 --> 19:46.120]  It is going to struggle in
[19:46.480 --> 19:52.780]  Certain lighting conditions and on the field that the Super Bowl is certainly after the game at nighttime is certainly one of them
[19:52.780 --> 19:57.660]  I thought it it I thought that there was a tangible realness to it
[19:57.660 --> 20:02.580]  And no, this is not the type of photo. You're gonna put on a billboard a shot with iPhone 6, but it
[20:03.180 --> 20:04.740]  The photo itself wasn't great
[20:04.740 --> 20:10.420]  But I thought that the whole hell even the CEO of Apple takes tweets after an exciting thing like this is
[20:10.740 --> 20:15.720]  Was an interesting angle, you know, and it may and I I think he shouldn't have deleted it
[20:15.720 --> 20:21.000]  Like he should have like it could have been a hilarious like segue in like the next Apple presentation or something. Yes
[20:21.000 --> 20:27.680]  yes, like own it let it play out and then and then and then you could you know,
[20:27.680 --> 20:30.440]  You can make a joke about it and a subsequent event
[20:31.080 --> 20:38.040]  Right. No exactly exactly like people that's like that's what Twitter does Twitter Twitter is run on snark
[20:38.840 --> 20:46.080]  Unfortunately, he can't quite pay the bills or snark yet. Anyway, but I know I mean it's it's people are gonna make fun of it
[20:46.080 --> 20:52.320]  That's what people do and yeah, I I think the the real mistake was was in was in deleting it
[20:52.320 --> 20:54.520]  And and then you just look yeah
[20:54.520 --> 20:59.280]  Cuz then it reinforces it it takes away the credibility from things you say in the future
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.160]  Like if you do something like that, like you said it makes you look real makes look human. We've all taken crappy photos
[21:04.920 --> 21:07.040]  and and
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.400]  you know
[21:08.400 --> 21:16.320]  there's a benefit to to a long-term benefit even if it's very slight to being a regular guy and not being a you know,
[21:16.320 --> 21:19.520]  Feeling like everything is run through PR and control and all that sort of stuff
[21:20.320 --> 21:23.960]  Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I would like to you know
[21:23.960 --> 21:30.120]  Avoid or I feel like the collect that collectively and we can't I can't nobody's gonna listen to me
[21:30.120 --> 21:56.600]  Just cuz I'm saying it on the show and I'm not saying you know, poor Tim Cook can't take it, but I just feel like collectively Twitter's group behavior forces people in higher profiles to be as guarded on Twitter as they are anywhere else, you know, whereas Twitter could be a place where you know, somebody like the CEO of the biggest company in the world could
[21:57.280 --> 21:59.040]  Have a little fun
[21:59.040 --> 22:00.680]  But it's like yeah
[22:00.680 --> 22:03.800]  It's like we have to ruin everything and it's like I'm sorry
[22:03.800 --> 22:08.400]  And I'm not trying to make excuses for it just because it's an iPhone and I mean it was not a great photo
[22:08.400 --> 22:15.080]  But it wasn't horrible. It wasn't like ridiculous. And if you don't understand that that's a tough condition to get a photo. I
[22:16.520 --> 22:21.800]  Mean it's it's like I don't know what to tell you. Yeah. No, I mean there is a
[22:21.800 --> 22:25.600]  Yeah, I mean it this is this is one of those things where
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.600]  People, you know people like they have people like to be outraged and they like to they like to
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.240]  Make a big deal out of stuff that that probably really isn't that big a deal and
[22:36.240 --> 22:43.360]  And I think there's there's a sense particularly for someone like Tim Cook or anyone that has relatively high profile like there. There's a there's a
[22:43.360 --> 22:51.160]  Dehumanization that kind of occurs to it. And again, I don't think that I don't think that Tim Cook was losing sleep
[22:51.800 --> 22:54.960]  because people were making fun of his photo, but you know, it's like
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.200]  Unfortunately, that's just the reality of being a public forum. And I think this is you know
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.840]  It's a real this is a real a real challenge for Twitter
[23:02.840 --> 23:09.080]  I mean beyond Twitter's all of other Twitter's problems, but is this it's the the virtue is that
[23:09.080 --> 23:14.080]  All of other Twitter's problems, but is this it's the the virtue is being public
[23:14.080 --> 23:20.920]  The virtue is the fact you can connect and talk to anyone right and that is the downside in spades, right?
[23:23.400 --> 23:29.800]  How long after he posted that tweet do you think he's phone jingled and looks down and it says Steve Dowling
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.680]  You totally
[23:35.680 --> 23:39.520]  Envisioned how this happened, right? So he was I think he was in the box. He's down the field
[23:39.600 --> 23:42.980]  It's very like I'm sure it's very exciting the stuff we were on takes a picture
[23:42.980 --> 23:45.320]  He probably just posted with barely even looking at it
[23:45.920 --> 23:46.960]  and
[23:46.960 --> 23:48.960]  Yes, I call
[23:49.840 --> 23:55.680]  It started without ever having been even I've never been in this stadium for a Super Bowl
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.540]  but just watching on TV, which I think almost makes it seem more sane because like they have
[24:00.540 --> 24:08.020]  Cameras that are high up that are that are stable and the cameramen on the field are truly truly amazing professional
[24:08.140 --> 24:12.140]  Photographers that it it's controlled barely controlled pandemonium
[24:12.840 --> 24:15.340]  you know with no not not overstating it and
[24:16.660 --> 24:19.560]  You just know that like ten minutes later Dowling out of column
[24:21.860 --> 24:27.020]  And I bet it was a tough call I bet it was like yeah, you know, I bet it wasn't like a clear-cut call
[24:27.020 --> 24:30.460]  Yeah, I don't know. I thought it was funny
[24:30.460 --> 24:34.920]  I I just wish he should have owned it like he said like it would have made a hilarious
[24:35.340 --> 24:43.420]  Like I mean as hilarious as such things can be but sort of like ten second interlude at the WWDC or something
[24:43.420 --> 24:46.840]  Yeah, like we're the next iPhone introduction, you know
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.480]  Like we're we're or the 5 SC or whatever. It comes with X amount of camera on good lord. Do I need it?
[24:52.480 --> 24:57.940]  You know, I mean, I think the problem is that and maybe the problem is that the timing doesn't work because new iPhones aren't gonna
[24:57.940 --> 25:02.680]  Come till September and they have at least two events between now and then and then it'll be old news by September
[25:02.740 --> 25:04.740]  Well, whatever you could still
[25:05.020 --> 25:08.520]  It would be perfect if they had like new high-end, you know
[25:09.460 --> 25:11.820]  Phones coming next month. It would be perfect
[25:11.820 --> 25:17.100]  it would almost would have been suspicious that they planned it right people would be you know, all of a sudden that would be the
[25:17.660 --> 25:18.900]  you know
[25:18.900 --> 25:22.660]  The conspiracy theories have come out that they faked it on purpose
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.100]  Rubbed rub that they rubbed
[25:27.940 --> 25:33.580]  You know rubbed some kind of grease all over the camera lens, yeah, so you saw this photo I actually took two
[25:33.660 --> 25:35.960]  Here's the one I took with the new iPhone 7
[25:38.900 --> 25:43.660]  Anyway, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor it is our good friends at

[28:09.640 --> 28:13.120]  All right, that's a good segue to talking about Twitter, right?
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.000]  Yes, so we went from the Super Bowl to Tim this could be a very seamless show this
[28:18.600 --> 28:22.040]  Could be a bunch of good segues. Let's see we can keep it going Super Bowl
[28:22.440 --> 28:26.040]  Tim Cook at the Super Bowl in his tweet that he that he deleted
[28:26.040 --> 28:31.960]  Also by the way the second one he posted the photo was beautiful. It was a really good photo
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.880]  now let's talk about Twitter and
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.560]  You you had a good piece. I think it just went up yesterday as we record
[28:41.680 --> 28:44.840]  Yes, it's been up for about 24 hours or so
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.360]  I don't want to paraphrase too much
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.760]  But just of it being you quoted the thing that I wrote that and I've said this before I've said this many times that the
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.620]  Thing that really is unfair to Twitter and hurts Twitter. Is that they're compared to Facebook
[28:58.560 --> 29:01.300]  Maybe mostly by like that sort of Wall Street perspective
[29:02.040 --> 29:04.040]  and
[29:04.280 --> 29:11.300]  They measure they come up short and as time goes on they're coming up shorter and shorter because Facebook is killing it and Twitter is
[29:11.300 --> 29:13.300]  Sort of spinning its wheels
[29:13.400 --> 29:19.880]  And it it's unfair to Twitter because Twitter has an amazing thing it just happens to be this amazing thing that
[29:20.400 --> 29:21.700]  seemingly
[29:21.700 --> 29:26.400]  Naturally is way smaller in Facebook and your argument is be that as it may they're screwed
[29:27.440 --> 29:34.180]  Yeah, well the the the real problem with for them and and for it for any company is you know that they're they're
[29:34.540 --> 29:38.240]  The the business model I mean Twitter made a choice
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.740]  To be a ad supported business and that choice has
[29:46.160 --> 29:48.160]  Certain you know certain implications to it
[29:48.160 --> 29:53.360]  What basically you if you're an ad support business you either have to have these
[29:54.160 --> 29:59.240]  extremely high-performing ads that convert like Google or you need to have a
[29:59.620 --> 30:02.840]  Massive audience that you're very good at targeting
[30:03.880 --> 30:06.400]  you know more like a Facebook sort of thing and
[30:07.280 --> 30:12.960]  Twitter doesn't doesn't really have either and and so the big problem is that yes from a user perspective
[30:12.960 --> 30:20.480]  to use Facebook and to use Twitter are different experiences, but they're competing for the same
[30:21.200 --> 30:26.180]  customer or by customer, I mean the same advertiser and the same advertising dollars and and
[30:27.520 --> 30:32.600]  That's that that's a problem because what if you're an advertiser and you have limited not just money
[30:32.600 --> 30:38.520]  But limited time like there's there's a time component to Twitter wants their custom ad campaigns Facebook wants their custom ad campaigns
[30:38.520 --> 30:41.560]  Google wants your custom ad campaigns Pinterest wants their custom ad campaigns
[30:41.560 --> 30:47.040]  You know snapchat all these sorts of things and yes, there is a shift in money from you know
[30:47.040 --> 30:51.680]  Other forms of media to digital, but where are you going to spend your time?
[30:53.040 --> 30:55.120]  particularly when
[30:55.120 --> 30:56.760]  You can get
[30:56.760 --> 31:04.600]  Pretty much the same audience with better data better targeting better tracking and they have enough inventory to satisfy your needs on Facebook
[31:04.600 --> 31:08.800]  what what's the point even spending money on on Twitter and so
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.920]  The that's just that's just a problem and it's a problem from a long-term
[31:14.920 --> 31:20.400]  Sustainability perspective and it's a problem from a absolutely from a stock perspective. I mean there's Twitter's stock is
[31:20.960 --> 31:22.960]  down massively
[31:23.480 --> 31:29.440]  from its highs and even from from its IPO price in part because you you know that
[31:31.040 --> 31:32.680]  Investors are
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.680]  rightly in my estimation losing
[31:34.680 --> 31:38.880]  Faith that there's any sort of real growth story for Twitter
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.720]  I mean a company that is more than 10 years old and has yet to turn a profit, right?
[31:45.280 --> 31:49.020]  And it's a bummer it's a bummer it's like the thing with Twitter is
[31:50.440 --> 31:54.720]  There I think I mean back back when Twitter made this decision
[31:54.720 --> 32:00.080]  there was still kind of the sense that you know at of course all consumer services will be ad supported and
[32:00.080 --> 32:06.120]  And and I actually think that's in it's increasingly questionable the egregious that's gonna be the point
[32:06.120 --> 32:08.440]  I mean face because Facebook and Google are so dominant and
[32:08.960 --> 32:15.320]  The big difference is you know, they have so much inventory like they can soak up, you know, so much so much of the spend
[32:15.920 --> 32:19.680]  So you have a better product and all the inventory there. Why are you getting anywhere else?
[32:20.560 --> 32:22.560]  Twitter like Twitter's
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.760]  do the format of Twitter is isn't as as
[32:26.760 --> 32:32.360]  Great for advertising. What is Twitter good at Twitter is good at data Twitter has
[32:33.080 --> 32:37.400]  Real-time data and the idea was the data they have about users
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.680]  who are
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.840]  building an interest graph as opposed to a
[32:42.640 --> 32:48.600]  Social graph that would make the potential for targeting, you know much more interesting and attractive
[32:48.600 --> 32:49.160]  You know
[32:49.160 --> 32:54.080]  The flip side is the way you get a good interest graph is by going through the hard work of building of Twitter feed
[32:54.080 --> 32:56.760]  Which is really difficult and is a big problem. They didn't get new users
[32:58.040 --> 32:59.560]  but
[32:59.560 --> 33:02.080]  That data the data that happens on Twitter
[33:02.080 --> 33:04.000]  the fact that Twitter is so
[33:04.000 --> 33:10.720]  central to things like the Super Bowl and things that are going on and you can get real-time understanding of what's happening and what's what's
[33:11.160 --> 33:13.160]  Pulsing and what's trending?
[33:13.760 --> 33:20.280]  It's it's too bad. They didn't explore business model built around exploiting that. Yeah, same thing for me last night as a
[33:20.280 --> 33:28.280]  As a political junkie us national political junkie at least watching last night as we record. It's the day after the New Hampshire primary
[33:29.240 --> 33:30.720]  Which wasn't all that exciting?
[33:30.720 --> 33:35.360]  I mean it was kind of this is that was one that came out sort of as the the polls got it exactly, right?
[33:35.480 --> 33:39.840]  But as a political junkie, I'm still watching, you know, I'm watching MSNBC
[33:39.840 --> 33:42.800]  I'm I'm you know, I'm that second screen guy
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.480]  It's a it's a you know
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.120]  and I'm at the point now where I can't even remember watching as a political junkie watching something like
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.160]  The returns on an election or a primary election without Twitter
[33:55.480 --> 33:58.880]  because one of the things that always made it frustrating to me as a news junkie is
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.880]  That the news on an election night doesn't come in fast enough
[34:03.080 --> 34:06.640]  The news doesn't come in and so they just fill it with the punditry
[34:06.880 --> 34:13.620]  But because there's not much news coming in they're just going to multiple people to sort of say the same thing
[34:13.620 --> 34:17.740]  right, and it doesn't go fast enough to satisfy my
[34:18.900 --> 34:20.580]  attention-addled brain
[34:20.580 --> 34:24.340]  Okay, and so Twitter fills that in because all of a sudden that's where you know
[34:24.340 --> 34:31.500]  Somebody will come up with something that's actually an interesting observation or a funny joke or something the snark we referred to earlier
[34:31.500 --> 34:35.620]  Yeah, well, I think Twitter in Twitter, it's funny. You mentioned within the context of politics
[34:35.620 --> 34:38.940]  I think the problem for Twitter and the challenge for Twitter is actually
[34:38.940 --> 34:43.620]  Kind of similar to the problem faced by news in general
[34:43.620 --> 34:50.340]  I mean news is very valuable and it's also worthless because it's fish wrap literally
[34:50.340 --> 34:56.340]  I mean, that's it's it's an old joke if you ever worked in a newspaper industry, but today's news is tomorrow's fish wrap
[34:56.540 --> 34:59.740]  That's exactly it and but the problem now is today's tweet it like
[35:00.700 --> 35:05.080]  Twitter is so valuable because someone can break a story with a tweet, right?
[35:05.080 --> 35:12.040]  But like I'll ever the the tweet is then worthless or and and or the the news in the tweet is then worthless, right?
[35:12.040 --> 35:16.760]  It's like you it's out there like there's there's no there's no value
[35:17.760 --> 35:22.080]  It's uh, it's a public good now. It can't it can't be kept it can't be captured
[35:22.720 --> 35:25.640]  And that's kind of the case for Twitter. I mean Twitter
[35:25.640 --> 35:32.380]  I mean, it's almost impossible to read a news story about lots of things without there being an embedded tweet, for example, right?
[35:32.380 --> 35:38.020]  uh, but but that doesn't make it worth something at least from a
[35:38.380 --> 35:43.540]  Traditional sort of advertising perspective where Twitter has to keep all the eyeballs and then that sort of thing going on like yes
[35:43.660 --> 35:47.460]  you you can recognize that Twitter is essential and
[35:48.060 --> 35:51.420]  Appreciate the fact that Twitter can be essential for you know
[35:51.420 --> 35:54.540]  Someone who doesn't use Twitter because they're gonna find out about what happened on Twitter
[35:55.180 --> 35:59.100]  Immediately anyways, you know through through through some other channel or through through a web page
[35:59.100 --> 36:05.140]  they read and and now you almost have to think like the model that might have worked for Twitter and
[36:06.060 --> 36:12.860]  It would you know, what's the most successful news company arguably? It's something like Bloomberg right where they they actually
[36:13.560 --> 36:17.660]  The news is a means to sell a physical product
[36:18.220 --> 36:22.140]  And the physical product is in part about utility. It's in part about status
[36:22.140 --> 36:29.020]  It's in part about the the internal social network that Bloomberg terminals have and in that all Wall Street uses to talk to each other
[36:29.020 --> 36:30.780]  and
[36:30.780 --> 36:36.720]  That is something that like that sort of model a a platform model
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.700]  But a different kind of platform model not an advertising platform model is something that might have made sense for Twitter
[36:41.700 --> 36:45.200]  But this is where you get back to the fact that Twitter didn't even start
[36:45.620 --> 36:52.100]  Twitter spent so long so many years at the beginning not developing the product not developing monetization
[36:52.540 --> 36:54.540]  But basically trying to kill each other
[36:54.540 --> 36:58.980]  and I mean, you know metaphorically speaking I
[37:00.100 --> 37:03.380]  still feel like institutionally there is a
[37:06.900 --> 37:08.900]  Uncertainty as to what the hell Twitter is
[37:09.420 --> 37:14.540]  Right. Yeah, and I and it hasn't they had it when they came out when they came out in
[37:14.980 --> 37:19.740]  2006 or I don't know if there was something in 2005 but 2006 is when I signed up
[37:19.740 --> 37:26.380]  There was a clear idea of what it was or what it was supposed to be and it obviously evolved over the years
[37:26.380 --> 37:28.760]  Like what they're I'm not saying they should go back to the original idea
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.760]  I mean they didn't even have things like at replies
[37:30.860 --> 37:33.240]  There was all this stuff that came out of user behavior
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.860]  The whole the original idea was tell people what you're up to it was I think in an elevator pitch
[37:39.860 --> 37:42.380]  it was your AOL status at a
[37:44.340 --> 37:46.340]  Combined with the old Unix
[37:46.340 --> 37:49.260]  a finger, you know, right
[37:50.300 --> 37:51.900]  status
[37:51.900 --> 37:53.900]  right
[37:54.100 --> 37:57.780]  Do you remember that? I mean I better explain that for anybody who doesn't know
[37:58.580 --> 38:02.420]  Because you would people would with this was and this is an advantage. Um
[38:03.060 --> 38:04.380]  This was something okay
[38:04.380 --> 38:09.140]  There's a there's a some anecdote around messaging services about why some one and some din
[38:09.140 --> 38:12.940]  But yeah, people would would set their their and this is back
[38:12.940 --> 38:16.100]  We're in college. We're in college like set their their AOL status
[38:18.100 --> 38:22.460]  That's our college when I was college when I was in college you set your finger status
[38:22.660 --> 38:26.100]  So when I was in college, well, I mean, I don't know when this fell apart
[38:26.100 --> 38:31.900]  But you'd get like an account on a Unix, you know machine and that's where you'd go to check your email and stuff like that
[38:31.900 --> 38:38.580]  But if you created an account in your home folder with the name dot finger now the dot made it like a secret invisible file
[38:38.580 --> 38:39.820]  So you wouldn't see it all the time
[38:39.820 --> 38:45.380]  You would just put like where you are like if you were home for winter break and you weren't around you could put it in
[38:45.380 --> 38:47.900]  There and then if you wanted to check the status of somebody
[38:49.340 --> 38:52.580]  You know, you would just say finger Ben at
[38:53.380 --> 38:57.620]  Whatever school Ben goes to dot edu and then it would read back your key fan
[38:57.620 --> 39:03.780]  I know who's the idiot who named the command finger? I I don't I don't know. Maybe they knew exactly what they were doing
[39:03.780 --> 39:11.700]  And there's there's actually a lot of stuff like this in like old tech sort of stuff. That's just really questionable in retrospect
[39:13.340 --> 39:16.260]  Right here is Navy conventions and like right?
[39:16.740 --> 39:19.140]  Yeah, the idea was that you're like poking a finger out
[39:19.140 --> 39:22.580]  I'm like, what's he up to and then you could just you would just update your finger, you know
[39:22.580 --> 39:26.420]  And that's what Twitter was Twitter was like, what are you up to? What are you doing? And you would say I'm eating a sandwich
[39:26.420 --> 39:28.820]  I'm you know getting my first
[39:29.540 --> 39:31.540]  you know coffee of the day and
[39:31.540 --> 39:34.620]  And then what it and evolved from there
[39:35.700 --> 39:42.540]  The thing the thing the way that I always thought about it is I mean the thing is Twitter evolved really quickly like oh and
[39:42.940 --> 39:50.220]  Actually, most of the core conventions of Twitter like the at reply and the retweet and all sort of stuff were in the product
[39:50.220 --> 39:55.140]  Within like a year to a year and a half and it basically the product has not evolved since then
[39:55.140 --> 40:00.460]  I think the one the one real big addition was the was the real retweet like where you could with it
[40:00.460 --> 40:02.460]  Not the manual retreat right where you actually did it
[40:02.660 --> 40:05.540]  I think that was 2009 or something like that
[40:05.660 --> 40:12.180]  But other than that like the product would the product figured it out pretty quickly and the way the way I always characterized it
[40:12.180 --> 40:16.780]  I wrote a piece about this like over a year ago was this was actually a big problem for Twitter
[40:16.780 --> 40:19.660]  And the reason it was a problem was you know
[40:19.660 --> 40:24.580]  They'd have like product market fit for companies right a company has to like they have the idea for product and it's not quite
[40:24.580 --> 40:26.860]  Right, but they figure out who their core customer is then they get it
[40:26.860 --> 40:31.420]  Right, and then like once you get that right you get your product and your mark and you know your market
[40:31.420 --> 40:32.540]  You're the right product for it
[40:32.540 --> 40:37.740]  that's when you pour on the money you and you scale and you get a bunch of customers that sort of thing but you have
[40:37.740 --> 40:39.740]  to get product market fit first and
[40:40.620 --> 40:47.180]  Almost the challenge for Twitter was the they the initial product was so it was so powerful
[40:47.180 --> 40:48.060]  It was so good
[40:48.060 --> 40:53.020]  Like they never had to go through that sort of struggle to figure out what it is
[40:53.020 --> 40:57.180]  It just took off and date and so they never had to go through that internal
[40:57.340 --> 41:02.660]  process of figuring out what their product is who their customer is like what it does it just happened and
[41:02.900 --> 41:04.900]  So the problem was it didn't happen
[41:05.620 --> 41:10.500]  Perfectly enough to reach everyone like it would the utility was so good
[41:10.500 --> 41:13.300]  The Twitter's always been hard to use like to get started
[41:13.300 --> 41:18.900]  I mean to get started from but the utility was so good that all us geeks were more than happy to jump through all the
[41:18.900 --> 41:22.500]  Hoops to figure out how to use it because the utility was so massive
[41:22.500 --> 41:26.660]  But you get down to like what I call a marginal user right where is it?
[41:26.660 --> 41:31.340]  What is the utility that I might get from Twitter worth the cost it's gonna take me to get up to it
[41:31.340 --> 41:35.580]  and they hit that marginal user after a few hundred million and they just
[41:36.100 --> 41:40.380]  round to a halt right and don't you think that it's the case that it's just
[41:40.900 --> 41:45.820]  Too hard to guess and when you're inside and like you work at Twitter
[41:45.820 --> 41:50.700]  And you're therefore have a reason to be optimistic and you get it because you actually work there
[41:50.700 --> 41:55.100]  It's easy to maybe even lie to yourself a little bit that during that growth spades
[41:56.020 --> 42:01.500]  Space early on while the product is still evolving and there's clearly enthusiasm
[42:01.500 --> 42:05.980]  You know you've got something electric on your hands that it's very unclear
[42:05.980 --> 42:11.100]  What how you know while the growth is going on how much growth there is ahead of you?
[42:11.100 --> 42:16.540]  It's right and and I think that Twitter guessed wrong. I think a lot of investors guessed wrong
[42:16.540 --> 42:19.180]  In terms of it being too optimistic
[42:19.180 --> 42:25.180]  Well the thing too is I don't think I I would say two things one Twitter's growth really
[42:25.180 --> 42:28.620]  It happened in 2009 where the growth just suddenly stopped
[42:28.620 --> 42:33.820]  That was also the time where Twitter was having massive technical problems like the site could not stay up
[42:34.700 --> 42:38.300]  Yeah, you know people don't forget the fail whale actually I have a fail whale clock
[42:40.620 --> 42:45.020]  But um like so they they had their hands full
[42:45.020 --> 42:51.820]  Basically rebuilding the service on the fly it used to you could count on it like clockwork that it would fail during an Apple event
[42:52.460 --> 42:58.220]  Oh, well, it used to fail almost every day. I mean that was an improvement when it only failed during big events
[42:58.220 --> 43:01.500]  Well there was a time where it was on the verge of complete collapse
[43:02.700 --> 43:05.500]  Then there was a time where on a daily basis they were up
[43:05.500 --> 43:10.540]  But something like an Apple event could make a collapse which is totally but which is and again for
[43:10.540 --> 43:14.060]  Me and you and the folks who listen to the talk show yeah, that's a big deal
[43:14.060 --> 43:18.940]  But compared to the Super Bowl or the Academy Awards or an election night
[43:18.940 --> 43:24.380]  There's nothing like however much attention Apple gets compared to any other technical company
[43:24.380 --> 43:32.140]  They don't get that much for a Tuesday morning at noon Eastern press event and yet right Twitter would just be
[43:33.180 --> 43:38.460]  And that was that was a big reason why Dorsey got forced out the first time and so they have they have management
[43:38.460 --> 43:41.500]  They have the site barely staying up. They have to rebuild the whole thing from scratch
[43:41.500 --> 43:47.020]  I mean Twitter started out like being like a Ruby on Rails application right which is yeah, which is which is all well and good
[43:47.020 --> 43:53.420]  But it's not it's not the framework you would choose to to to handle you know hundreds of millions of tweets a second or whatever
[43:54.940 --> 44:02.940]  Then and so and that happened at the exact same moment they hit this marginal user and so it was it was it was bad luck
[44:02.940 --> 44:05.980]  From that perspective in that in that it happened at that time
[44:05.980 --> 44:09.500]  and then I had another point here where it was but but
[44:09.500 --> 44:19.020]  They oh the other thing too is I don't think at that time if you were to tell someone in 2008-2009 that a set a user base of 300 million users
[44:19.020 --> 44:26.220]  You know I question how how many of those are actual people using it, but even you say it's 100 million 150 million you
[44:27.740 --> 44:32.700]  It would be hard to tell someone back then that that would not be a big enough user base to have a
[44:32.700 --> 44:39.500]  An ad-supported service yes, that's a very good point now before I forget because if I forget this point
[44:39.500 --> 44:44.860]  I'm gonna shoot myself and want to rerecord the whole episode because I thought one of the most interesting things I read in your piece
[44:44.860 --> 44:48.380]  And I knew this I've known this before I've read this before
[44:48.940 --> 44:51.740]  But it's one of those facts that goes in one ear and out the other for me
[44:51.740 --> 44:57.180]  And I think for a lot of other people, but I almost feel like the situation this whole situation
[44:57.180 --> 45:06.460]  We're talking about with Twitter struggling LinkedIn having some tough times and only Facebook and Google really thriving in this
[45:07.020 --> 45:15.500]  Market where people previously foresaw wow lots and lots of companies could have this free with ad-supported business and succeed is the fact that
[45:16.060 --> 45:21.740]  Very very consistently over I I'm not even sure you could tell me the time frame, but decades at least
[45:21.740 --> 45:29.500]  About one point two percent of GDP get spent on advertising. Yep. It's it's it's it's amazingly consistent like so
[45:29.500 --> 45:34.060]  There's a everything was on a recession. It goes down to it goes on his GP goes down
[45:34.060 --> 45:38.860]  It's it's amazing how consistent it is right advertising is and I you know
[45:38.860 --> 45:45.500]  I'm not gonna say I'm a big shot on advertising, but I do run a business. That's fundamentally based on advertising I
[45:45.500 --> 45:53.980]  Think that the nature of it knock on wood like even like 2008, you know during fireball actually did pretty well through the recession
[45:55.340 --> 45:58.700]  Maybe because I'm a boutique, you know publisher
[45:59.740 --> 46:03.580]  But there's absolutely no question that the adage that
[46:04.140 --> 46:07.660]  Advertised in any kind of recession advertising is the first thing to dry up
[46:07.660 --> 46:14.780]  It is the first thing always because it's the first thing any kind of advertising is the first thing to dry up
[46:14.780 --> 46:18.780]  First thing any company when they say we might need to tighten our spending
[46:19.420 --> 46:23.180]  It's advertising is always the first thing to go right and then when times are flush
[46:23.260 --> 46:25.260]  It is one of the first things to come rushing back
[46:25.980 --> 46:28.140]  Where they're like, wow, we've got a little money to spend
[46:28.700 --> 46:34.060]  Let's fuck let's dump it in some ads and and really accelerate what you know, we've got something good going on right now
[46:34.060 --> 46:36.220]  Let's spend some advertising to make it go even better
[46:36.540 --> 46:43.020]  But it's amazing that it's very very consistent that it's like just a little over one percent of GDP which means
[46:43.020 --> 46:49.980]  That it's not necessarily that the pie can't grow but the pie can only grow as the overall economy grows
[46:50.620 --> 46:55.020]  Right, and it's there's no way to make that go and I feel like a lot of the stories
[46:55.900 --> 47:02.300]  I i'm not even saying that i'm that i'm not wrong about it that I didn't think i i'm a little surprised at this situation
[47:02.300 --> 47:08.300]  Right now where the only big companies that really seem to be thriving financially and growing are facebook and google the only ones
[47:08.620 --> 47:11.980]  I don't think I would have foreseen that but I think it makes some sense
[47:11.980 --> 47:17.100]  Some sense when you think of the fact that the ad spends is sort of a fixed amount of money
[47:17.900 --> 47:20.620]  and facebook and google are clearly growing
[47:21.500 --> 47:22.780]  and
[47:22.780 --> 47:29.260]  And they have they frankly have superior products. I mean they they have the best targeting especially facebook. I mean, um,
[47:29.580 --> 47:35.020]  You know facebook is growing much faster than google is uh, particularly particularly on mobile and all their growth is on mobile
[47:35.020 --> 47:42.860]  Uh, they have superior targeting they have a superior ad placement like of people don't appreciate like a facebook ad
[47:43.260 --> 47:45.660]  Literally takes over the entire screen of your phone
[47:46.300 --> 47:52.780]  Like maybe only for a split second or whatever, but like it's the most immersive ad we've come up with in tech
[47:53.820 --> 47:59.180]  I mean beyond like the pre-roll on a video, but that pre-roll video is kind of annoying right that's getting in our way
[47:59.420 --> 48:03.260]  whereas we're willingly, you know, not you since you're on facebook, but um,
[48:03.260 --> 48:05.980]  We're really immersing ourselves in this feed
[48:06.780 --> 48:11.740]  And just scrolling through it and the feed is so clear like that's why it works so well for during fireball, right?
[48:11.740 --> 48:15.660]  I mean you I I always give you credit for actually being a real pioneer when it comes to
[48:16.220 --> 48:22.140]  This sort of native native advertising feed-based advertising is is the advertising that works on mobile
[48:22.620 --> 48:25.260]  I came up with it before native advertising was a word
[48:25.660 --> 48:31.820]  I know you did and and it's like it is the ad format that works like every every time there's a new
[48:31.820 --> 48:36.700]  A new sort of medium, uh, it takes time to figure out the ads that work, right?
[48:36.700 --> 48:43.820]  The initial like tv ads where people reading radio scripts, right? They had to figure out no you should actually tv is for scripted drama
[48:43.820 --> 48:49.980]  So, how about we do a 30-second scripted drama exactly right and make a little 30 the best ads are always little 30-second shows
[48:50.620 --> 48:55.500]  Right, exactly. And so when we started out it is you see when we started out with web pages
[48:55.500 --> 48:59.820]  We're just like plastering on these banner ads because that's kind of what we do with newspapers, right?
[48:59.820 --> 49:06.140]  And who better who better to be the protagonist of your little story than a a bow
[49:07.660 --> 49:09.660]  We are this is a very this is a very tightly
[49:10.380 --> 49:12.640]  We're pretty pretty a real bow an anthropomorphic
[49:13.580 --> 49:15.760]  human bowel infected with diarrhea
[49:18.060 --> 49:24.540]  There's a lovable character no, but you're right you've got to find and sometimes it's natural and sometimes it's not and they always try to
[49:24.620 --> 49:26.620]  Cram the last one onto the new
[49:26.620 --> 49:33.260]  uh, I mean that's a banner ads banner ads were basically lifting newspaper type advertising and putting on the web and it was dumb it
[49:33.260 --> 49:36.460]  Made no sense. Well, especially in no sense because if you think about it
[49:36.460 --> 49:39.500]  I would say it's a little bit more like magazines than newspapers first thing
[49:39.500 --> 49:45.980]  Just because the shape of the rectangle is a little bit the rectangle of a web page is a little bit more like a magazine
[49:45.980 --> 49:50.220]  Especially in the 90s when the format was invented and screens were smaller
[49:50.860 --> 49:56.540]  It was a little bit more like a magazine it's but magazines and newspapers are kind of two sides of the same coin when it comes to
[49:56.540 --> 49:58.460]  advertising
[49:58.460 --> 49:59.340]  formats, right
[49:59.340 --> 50:04.140]  There's a whole page ads but the banner ads were like the ads in the back of the magazine
[50:04.460 --> 50:11.900]  Right, right the you know little shapes of rectangles with content flowing around them the in in in magazines and newspapers
[50:12.060 --> 50:13.500]  I mean they
[50:13.500 --> 50:17.020]  The the ones that made all the money were the full page ads right the back page
[50:17.340 --> 50:23.260]  Right, it was more if you think of a magazine in particular and you think of like the classic examples like fashion magazine
[50:23.260 --> 50:27.340]  That sort of thing if it actually is more like a feed if you think about it, right?
[50:27.660 --> 50:35.180]  Because you're you're you're not jumping around like you flip through those, right? Yeah, it's exactly it's very analogous to like an instagram feed
[50:36.300 --> 50:39.340]  Exactly. This is why this is why I i've always been
[50:39.820 --> 50:40.780]  um a
[50:40.780 --> 50:47.180]  I think native advertising got a really bad rap because of some really egregious examples of people like, you know
[50:48.540 --> 50:52.300]  Being you know abusing it and doing dumb stuff advertorials, right?
[50:52.300 --> 50:57.500]  right things that were things that were written to sort of conflate what was actually the content of
[50:57.900 --> 50:59.900]  uh the publication and the
[51:00.220 --> 51:05.580]  This thing that was written by a sponsor. I mean famously those have always been terrible right on all formats, right?
[51:05.580 --> 51:11.740]  But that doesn't mean the idea of having an ad that is a similar of a similar type
[51:12.380 --> 51:15.500]  To the content that is around it is a bad thing
[51:15.580 --> 51:18.380]  That's that's how effective advertising has always been I mean
[51:18.380 --> 51:25.340]  I mean no one's up in arms because you flip through a fashion magazine and on one page there's there's editorial on the next page
[51:25.420 --> 51:27.740]  there's uh, you know an ad like
[51:28.460 --> 51:32.940]  That that's a good thing. Same same with tv. I mean, yes, you may be annoyed by it
[51:33.020 --> 51:41.020]  but no one is like up in ethical arms because uh, oh my gosh, they also scripted this television commercial I mean like that's
[51:41.580 --> 51:47.360]  That's just the way that's just the way it is and the feed is is really the key to digital advertising
[51:47.360 --> 51:49.360]  You immerse yourself in it you go through it
[51:49.520 --> 51:53.920]  The problem is how this is why it works for during fireball people go to during fireball, right?
[51:54.240 --> 51:57.040]  Your percentage of people who go straight to the home page
[51:57.120 --> 51:57.760]  I don't know what it is
[51:57.760 --> 52:05.200]  But i'm sure it's much higher than the vast majority of websites who are getting their traffic through social or or other through other feeds
[52:05.260 --> 52:10.740]  Basically, and I think that's the real key to making advertising work is you have to own a destination
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.080]  That people go to and willingly immerse themselves in that feed
[52:14.080 --> 52:19.600]  They scroll through they read your your your advertisements just like they read your other pieces
[52:19.920 --> 52:27.600]  So they're actually consuming them and they're habituated to click on the link and follow through and uh, and that's the advertising that works
[52:27.680 --> 52:29.440]  the problem is
[52:29.440 --> 52:31.440]  particularly on mobile, uh
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.760]  People where do people start?
[52:33.760 --> 52:37.360]  Wait, they they they start on twitter and this is why twitter still has potential
[52:37.840 --> 52:43.840]  Uh, but the vast majority of people the vast vast vast majority people start on facebook that that's that's the app
[52:43.840 --> 52:49.600]  They open when they're doing nothing. The other thing too is is advertising works best when you're not doing something
[52:50.080 --> 52:56.800]  Right if i'm sitting down to do a job or to accomplish something i'm focused and I don't want to be distracted
[52:56.880 --> 53:00.400]  That's why I think uh, the priest the pre-roll ads on videos
[53:00.560 --> 53:04.480]  I think is is going to turn out to be less effective of format than people
[53:05.520 --> 53:10.240]  Had hoped they would be I mean it's video so it's going to be effective but it's an interruption which no no
[53:10.240 --> 53:14.640]  You it puts you in a bad mood. It does it always does and it often I often
[53:15.280 --> 53:16.320]  stop
[53:16.320 --> 53:20.880]  And yeah, you just close the tab and especially and I know
[53:22.160 --> 53:24.640]  My tolerance word has grown slightly
[53:25.440 --> 53:30.320]  Like but the ones when they make you say you have to watch the whole 30 then it's instant close
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.800]  I don't care what it is. I don't know that I maybe like once or twice a month
[53:34.960 --> 53:39.040]  I'll wait through the whole 30 because it really seems like something I have to see but
[53:39.040 --> 53:41.120]  it it doesn't and
[53:43.040 --> 53:46.480]  When I can stick skip it after three seconds I skip it every time
[53:47.200 --> 53:53.520]  I can maybe remember once in this like the last two or three months where there was something that was so compelling
[53:53.680 --> 53:55.680]  There was I don't remember i'll never remember this bit
[53:55.680 --> 53:59.920]  But there was like there was a youtube ad the one time and I could have skipped it within three seconds
[53:59.920 --> 54:04.560]  But I was instantly like oh i've got to see this and it was really pretty clever and I was like wow
[54:04.560 --> 54:06.240]  That was that was well done
[54:06.240 --> 54:09.040]  Right, but but yeah, I know I mean
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.280]  No one started a tv show with the advertising at the beginning, right?
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.280]  It was always it would be in the middle, right?
[54:15.280 --> 54:20.400]  You'd have the cliffhanger and then it'd go to commercial and then you'd you know, you know who has great pre-rolls geico
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.640]  Geico has a series of pre-rolls that that are uh
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.360]  The gist of it is this this this ad is going to be this ad for geico is going to be over before you can
[54:29.360 --> 54:32.960]  Even skip it right just they just buy like a four second spot
[54:32.960 --> 54:38.320]  No, I think that's the that that that's that's the that's the way to do it right and it really lives leaves me with this incredibly
[54:39.760 --> 54:45.200]  Uh, you're grateful to them for not wasting your time. Well, right. They didn't waste my time and I think hey that was pretty clever
[54:46.160 --> 54:47.200]  You know
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.080]  I it's it's both I they get a little bit of my gratitude and they get a little bit of my admiration for being clever
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.080]  Yeah
[54:54.080 --> 55:00.320]  No, I the the yeah, I agree. Um, but but the thing what's so compelling about facebook is um,
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.560]  You know, I i've I made this joke on my podcast exponent, but like people don't schedule facebook time, right?
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.600]  They don't put in their calendar
[55:07.600 --> 55:12.960]  This is when i'm going to go check facebook like they check facebook when they're standing in line at the store or they're sitting on
[55:12.960 --> 55:19.760]  The couch or like whatever like it's it's found time. It's and your posture is you're not doing anything
[55:19.760 --> 55:23.040]  you're just kind of mindlessly going through it and
[55:23.600 --> 55:24.960]  That sounds bad
[55:24.960 --> 55:32.320]  sounds bad, but that's actually makes it an incredible advertising platform because your your mind's open you're open to
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.800]  Whatever is in your feed, right?
[55:34.800 --> 55:41.620]  And that's when advertisers particularly brand advertisers that want to build sort of an affinity for their brand and a positive association
[55:41.920 --> 55:43.920]  That's when they most want to reach you
[55:44.320 --> 55:49.840]  And it makes I mean, that's what makes facebook's market so incredible. It's not just there's so many devices out there
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.800]  It's not that they have so many users and it's not just that there's more time spent on mobile other devices
[55:54.800 --> 55:56.800]  It's the kind of time that is spent
[55:57.200 --> 56:03.840]  uh, and and they have this feed and they have this great ad format and frankly if you're an advertiser like
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.680]  Why would you want to go?
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.200]  You know, why would you want to go anywhere else and that's the challenge that everyone else?
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.160]  You know and facebook is still growing the user base and there's still facebook last quarter and it
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.960]  This shouldn't be able to happen, but it happened they they got they got more users
[56:19.440 --> 56:22.240]  Their users use the product more than they ever had before
[56:22.240 --> 56:25.760]  They increase the ad load per user
[56:25.840 --> 56:33.440]  So people were seeing more ads and they increase the price charge per ad because they're so effective. They can do that. Like they're they're just this
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.960]  Gargantuan
[56:36.960 --> 56:42.720]  Monster that's gonna eat all the stuff up in and if you're linked in and you want to you want to have your own ad network
[56:42.720 --> 56:45.600]  or your yelp, you have display ads or or like like
[56:46.720 --> 56:48.720]  How can you compete?
[56:49.280 --> 56:50.800]  I don't know
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.000]  Because advertisers don't care advertisers just want the return on their investment
[56:54.240 --> 56:57.440]  And and and so one facebook is providing the best return to the best ads
[56:57.600 --> 57:03.440]  but also there's an investment standpoint facebook's offering an end-to-end product you go in you can do you can do a
[57:03.760 --> 57:05.360]  video ad on instagram
[57:05.360 --> 57:06.160]  uh
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.640]  Anyone who sees it will show them ads in their facebook feed that kind of reminds them of the product
[57:10.800 --> 57:12.960]  And then if you have a promotion you can have you know
[57:12.960 --> 57:17.840]  Do some things you can follow up with messenger like it's an end-to-end offering so you could master
[57:17.840 --> 57:21.920]  the facebook ad interface get really good at it and then why like
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.960]  Oh, you really want to go create a custom ad for pinterest. I mean like
[57:25.520 --> 57:26.560]  it
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.120]  there there's an there's a a degree of
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.480]  People are busy and why should why do they want to waste their time if they can just
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.840]  Their time is better spent spending more on facebook
[57:38.560 --> 57:40.880]  Or in google, I mean google is obviously the other the other one here
[57:40.880 --> 57:43.040]  I think google is less compelling on mobile generally
[57:43.040 --> 57:48.880]  But they also google has even better tools advertising tools like in an end-to-end offering from youtube to double quick
[57:49.280 --> 57:55.920]  To adsense like it's all one interface. You can do one by doing all at the same time. It's very very compelling. Yeah
[57:56.960 --> 57:58.960]  um
[57:59.440 --> 58:06.400]  Speaking of sponsorships, let me take another break here and tell you it's so it's so it's so funny before
[58:06.560 --> 58:08.000]  let's start up to you because like
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  I I I so i'm someone's working with me
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.400]  I mean i'm finally trying to get my archives in order and like categorize them and stuff and and she remarked that
[58:14.720 --> 58:16.720]  While you've had a lot of posts with advertising
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.080]  And i'm like, well, I mean the whole premise of checkery is to be about more about the business and strategy of tech
[58:22.160 --> 58:28.160]  I don't really do product reviews and all that sort of thing. Um, but that entails I talk a lot about advertising
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.800]  It's kind of amazing how little people
[58:31.360 --> 58:36.480]  um think about and talk about that side of it when it's so fundamental to
[58:37.120 --> 58:39.360]  the the experience of technology, I mean, um
[58:39.360 --> 58:43.380]  So, you know, yeah, i'm sure people probably get bored, but I find it fascinating
[58:48.400 --> 58:50.400]  Let me tell you about our good friends at igloo
[58:51.360 --> 58:57.440]  So igloo is the intranet you'll actually like there's a way what is an intranet even just think about it
[58:57.520 --> 59:01.200]  It's a website that is internal for you. That's the intra
[59:02.480 --> 59:03.920]  you
[59:03.920 --> 59:07.040]  Have a website for your team your your company
[59:07.040 --> 59:09.520]  You go there and this is where you
[59:10.160 --> 59:12.880]  Can communicate you can share files
[59:13.360 --> 59:16.320]  You can contact each other you can have shared calendars
[59:16.640 --> 59:21.760]  All this sort of stuff that you might want to do and instead of having it spread across seven different products
[59:21.920 --> 59:23.920]  And different things you have to log into
[59:24.800 --> 59:29.760]  It's all in one place and it is configurable. So if you
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.320]  Only need the microblog and the calendar and the file sharing that's all you really need to do
[59:36.320 --> 59:39.360]  And you can set it up like that. Um, and you can have you know, what's the microblog?
[59:39.360 --> 59:42.640]  It's like a little like internal twitter just for your team really really clever
[59:43.600 --> 59:46.080]  And their stuff it's all in the web. It's all web-based
[59:46.880 --> 59:52.480]  You don't have to host it yourself. They host it. It's private to you though, and it everything works from
[59:53.280 --> 59:55.280]  phone tablet
[59:55.520 --> 01:00:02.160]  Uh big big desktop browser that spreads across your 27-inch iMac, whatever you want. It's going to look great
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.680]  And they can help you keep doing your way better
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:10.000]  You don't have to like work like with the igloo system or whatever your team just keeps working the way it wants to work
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.240]  Like you share your files to where you want to just igloo is where you put them. It's a really really
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.440]  It's really just about making collaboration not be painful
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.760]  It's an internet you'll actually like it's a good they've embraced this word
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.000]  It's it's it's and like a lot of their advertising stuff and there's talking points, you know
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.440]  This whole internet you'll actually like is based on the fact that you most people work at a place where they have a quote-unquote
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.960]  Internet and it's this thing that people hate and that they try to work around
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:45.520]  igloo is like embracing the word and they're trying to like just flip it on its head because it's really really clever software modern stuff that
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.240]  Is really optimized for the way people want to work and making the people who use it happy
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.680]  As opposed to having this thing that just makes like the it guys happy
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.880]  For whatever reason that they chose whatever crappy internet throughout there other than igloo. So where do you go?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.940]  To find out more. It's easy. You go to igloo software.com
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.840]  Tts the slash tts is the talk show very very easy to remember
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.160]  You can try it for free. Anyway, it doesn't even it's not even like a special offer just because you're listening to the show
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.480]  You can try it for free, but uh go there go to the slash tts version though
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.640]  And then they'll know you came from the show. My thanks
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.160]  To igloo longtime sponsors of the show with a great great product that I know a lot of people who listen to the show are already
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160]  Using so my thanks to them
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.720]  The it I am there is a degree of um, I mean I've been right one
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600]  area I've been right about advertising is
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.280]  from a publishing perspective just because I mean publishers are
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.520]  They're they're the least equipped. I mean if twitter can't compete with facebook. I mean what chance is like you're
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.520]  Your local newspaper have um, and so i've been you're writing for a few years now
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.080]  There's going to be kind of a shakeout, you know, not just it's been happening newspapers for a long time
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.040]  But with digital first platforms as well
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.520]  um, and the hope is that in the long run there's going to be
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.680]  Figure out new ways of monetization things that are you know?
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.000]  Things that work well. Well, it does in the long in a bit
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.200]  Just I keep thinking about that. Like I said, I wanted to mention that 1.2 percent of spending thing and and
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.640]  Maybe that'll change in the future. Who knows maybe it'll go up maybe go down
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.280]  But it's been consistent for so long that you've kind of got to count on it and therefore go back to the 90s
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:33.280]  And the web is erupting if there was any idea in your head that the web was going to get some amount of advertising money
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.040]  Then it was obviously going to come away from existing sources
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.040]  And I think it was obvious that the most you know, most of the time
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.180]  And I think it was obvious that the most you know, most obvious place where it's going to come away from is newspapers
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  and if newspapers
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.960]  wanted to to
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120]  maintain any kind of uh
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.240]  Even stagnation let alone growth but at least no not deflate
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.680]  They needed to immediately embrace it and make sure that they were selling as much money on advertising on the web as possible
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.840]  And very very few of them did
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.960]  Right. Well, not just you know, it's hard. I mean, it's it's easy to sit and you know armchair quarterback
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.440]  But it's hard to really change your fundamental business, you know
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.120]  particularly
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.080]  Given the better rates. They could always they could always get for print. But I I think one thing that's that's potentially
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:27.280]  exciting in the very long run and I I always hesitate to use the word exciting because this is excitement that entails a lot of
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.480]  A lot of you know creative destruction along the way with um is
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.360]  Is it's all we you know might their
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.520]  To like twitter would be better off today if they would have not pursued an ad-based business model
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.080]  Like if they would have figured out some way to because again, they what they have is incredibly
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.000]  Valuable and I think the real danger for tour now
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.640]  Actually, this is kind of I've changed my tune a bit is like they need to not lose what they have, right?
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640]  They they need to be very careful
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.360]  They'd be very careful use the big the big problem for twitter is one
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.440]  Over a billion people or around a billion people have tried the product and left it
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.440]  And it's really hard to get people to come back like it's much harder than you know the first time
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.040]  It's an amazing number, right? It really is an amazing number. I mean, that's incredible
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.760]  uh, so one
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.960]  It's questionable if they can even get them back but two, uh
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.280]  twitter
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.600]  Is competing in a very different environment now whereas you know when twitter was
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:35.360]  cruder came along right when the iphone came along or a year before and it really took off once there were like
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.320]  Clients on the phone because it was such a perfect mobile product
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.400]  Like it had the feed and it had it was small bite-sized sort of stuff. You could dip in and dip out so easily
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.120]  Uh, it just it fit mobile so well and there was a real opportunity where people were forming habits
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.960]  they were forming the way they interacted with these devices and so
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.620]  It wasn't just when twitter was competing for users in 2009-2010
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.640]  They were competing for that mobile habit
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:11.040]  And today that people's habits are well established like and it's mostly facebook and and facebook is also now
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.640]  Facebook has expanded far beyond who you know like to what you're interested in facebook knows more about what you're interested in than twitter
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.000]  it twitter does
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  um and
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.720]  Like it's very legitimate to question like
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.600]  Does twitter is it really realistic to expect twitter to ever grow its user base? And if it's not
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160]  And I would contend it's not
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.600]  uh
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:41.680]  Then twitter should actually be focused first and foremost on preserving its user base, which would argue against
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.640]  Changes that are too extreme would argue for addressing, you know
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.440]  sexual abuse issues and stuff like that that drive people away from the platform. Um, and
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.280]  uh, and i'm not sure that uh twitter
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.080]  twitter agrees with that and so I it's a real danger for the company that
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.480]  They pursue an unobtainable goal and then lose what they have in the meantime
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:10.800]  I kind of feel like even with jack back at the helm, which I I I do feel like if anybody can fix it
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.760]  It's him
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.960]  but
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.680]  I do feel that there's just this inherent conflict between their internal ambitions
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.040]  and a realistic measure of
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760]  What it could and should be
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.000]  Yeah, and you also have to feel like you at this point you almost have to kind of hope they get acquired
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.560]  Um, you know, that's where I was going to go. Yeah
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.440]  yeah, I mean the the they're a nice like, um, you know,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.680]  They're like they're arguably still overvalued based on on on their potential revenue
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.000]  i'm, i'm not a stock analyst, but um
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.000]  uh
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.200]  they
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.720]  But with you know with under someone someone else if they could be free from that restraint either one build a new kind of
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.640]  business or two just be
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640]  be part of portfolio
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.640]  Um, the pro a big problem is you know, they're they're the only two requires that really make sense are are google or facebook
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.240]  Yeah, um who already have scale already have all the infrastructure could plug twitter in
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:13.840]  Um, the problem with google is is facebook is twitter did this big deal with with with google to give them access to the tweet
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080]  to the fire hose and
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.280]  Integrate double click with their with their ad buying platform
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.360]  so in many respects google already has everything from twitter that they need like
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.000]  They don't necessarily need to buy them to get what they already have. Uh, I think
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.920]  The couldn't they just unplug the fire plug though
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.360]  Well, no, no, I mean twitter, you know, if google is getting google is
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:43.600]  Google effectively has twitter both from a product perspective and from an advertising perspective because twitter like twitter is building in this this this deep
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.120]  double-clicking
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.920]  Um integration, you know integration and so you can
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.600]  Use your double click data and buy in all sort of stuff. Um
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.600]  So facebook I think facebook is actually the more likely
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:05.440]  more likely acquire unless google does it to prevent facebook from buying twitter, uh, but that's really the the
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.600]  The two candidates I did josh topolsky's podcast a couple days ago a week ago tomorrow and you know
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.120]  It's always fun doing a show with him. But because I feel like we fight so much. Um
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.680]  and uh
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.600]  We talked about this
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.800]  and
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.320]  I just said in broad terms facebook has been one of the things i'm surprised about in the last few years
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:32.880]  Is that facebook has been a very good steward of acquisitions and instagram is my favorite example because when facebook bought instagram
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.640]  I thought well there goes a thing. I you know, I really like instagram
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.360]  I'm sure it's going to go downhill and they're going to wreck it and instead it's
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.840]  They've more or less left it alone and let them evolve it in a way
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.280]  That's very natural to what instagram set out to be from the get-go
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.200]  Um, you know, if anything all they've done is just add support better better tech on the back end
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.320]  You know and they've let them grow very organically
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.140]  And that google is not so good as an acquisition
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:09.120]  You know that they they hire a lot of things in recom and some people pointed out to me that actually I I may
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.700]  I think I maybe i'm overlooking that and maybe i'm also overlooking the the transition from google to alphabet
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.480]  and that there's companies like nast that google now alphabet acquired and has let stand alone as
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.640]  As their own entity and let them be their own thing and not have to answer to you know
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.640]  The wall street on their own and that maybe it would be you know
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.680]  Don't think of it as a google acquisition of twitter, but think of it as an alphabet acquisition to twitter and they let twitter be twitter
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:42.720]  Um, but the value is being a part of yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead. Well, the value is being a part of google though
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.680]  Because that's it because you can't forget the money making part of it like the the the the ad part of it
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.920]  Unless google wants is like some sort of like fashion project
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.000]  I mean, frankly facebook would be the better acquire. Um, like facebook is an unbelievably well-run company
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.160]  Uh, like and the acquisition points you made are part of it
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.080]  Uh, they mark zuckerberg has been very explicit about how he thinks about growing and developing products
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:13.360]  And where they get the product right first they grow the user base only when it's at a certain level do they
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.200]  Slowly figure out then they build a business presence and then they monetize it and then they
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.920]  Monetize that business presence, you know in in a way that makes sense and it's easy to say
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.080]  Oh, well, it's easy for facebook to do that because they're making money so they can afford to take their time with instagram
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.160]  They can afford to take their time with whatsapp
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:37.120]  But people forget that facebook was under a lot of pressure after their ipo their their stock was also down by like half
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.960]  They they were getting a ton of pressure and facebook did not do the easy thing. They didn't just start slapping up ads
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.320]  Like they took time they rebuilt their mobile their entire mobile stack. They redid everything
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.440]  They realized that they they had taken the wrong approach with the hdml5 approach
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.560]  they rebuilt it made a great experience got people on board and then
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.080]  They figured out how to monetize it and then and they again it's the best digital ad unit
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.480]  We've ever seen and and now it's just it's it's it's a money spigot
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:14.240]  And the point is even when times were hard, they were disciplined and focused on getting the experience right first
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.080]  And and they're like the company like they they they understand this space. They understand social
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.880]  I think they'd be the best stewards of twitter. Um as much as that rankles twitter, uh in twitter users in particular
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.800]  Uh, but I mean who knows here's here this to me is a sign of how run and again
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.840]  I say this and I feel like i'm an interesting position because it's somebody who does not use facebook. Um
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.600]  But I do admire them and I do recognize that they are a very well-run company dustin curtis had a tweet last week
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.280]  This is after everybody released earnings. I'm going to trust his numbers. I didn't double check them
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.440]  So if there's an area i'll publish a correction next week, but I trust dustin curtis that he went through all these companies
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.760]  You know the the you know, the revenue the the financial things that they filed last week
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.360]  And it's revenue per employee for calendar year 2015 yahoo was 419 000 twitter
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.360]  419 000 twitter
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.440]  462 000
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.480]  microsoft
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.000]  Uh, almost double that 789 000 google
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.580]  1 million
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:16.960]  160
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.080]  1000
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.520]  per employee
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.700]  facebook
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.400]  1 million
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.440]  412 thousand dollars per employee in revenue
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.760]  And then at the top of the pile was apple with a little bit over 2 million in revenue right per employee
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.120]  um
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.400]  Which is a really I mean, it's facebook's closer to apple than they are to microsoft in revenue for employee
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.760]  That is very true. And uh, and they're well ahead of google
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.480]  Right and they're growing like they they're like their revenue was up like 40 last year or something
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.080]  But they're they're catching up that to me is a really really
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:02.800]  Those numbers really fit with my gut feeling of how well run these companies are, you know
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.880]  And and how efficient they are how well organized they are like whenever I hear about twitter's head count. I'm just blown away like
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.400]  4 000 or something like that with that like just little things like i've heard and i'm and this might have
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:22.800]  Been reduced recently, but at one point like last year that they had a hundred ios engineers and their ios apps quite frankly are shit
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.280]  I mean, maybe that's why you know, there's there's there might be a very strong to that like committee
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.000]  Yeah
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.040]  Yeah, and too many chefs spoil the you know stew or whatever the hell you're making and you know
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:39.040]  The mythical I feel like we butcher like five metaphors, which is butcher them all, you know throw in a uh, uh
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.080]  What's his name's mythical man month month?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:48.320]  Yes, you know that a hundred ios engineers really it not only does it not get you a better app faster
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  It gets you a worse app
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.040]  But I it's it's almost mine instagram has like 10 right or something like that
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:01.920]  I it's not a big my understanding at least is that it's not a big uh engineering crew at all and at the very least
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.760]  they
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:10.640]  Up until the point where facebook acquired them their their engineering team was uh easily fit around a conference table. Yep
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.560]  Really interesting numbers and that facebook's numbers are really astounding and if you think about it, it's not profit
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.280]  It's revenue per employee and that's where you know
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.640]  the one company that sticks out here is apple because apple's a hardware company and so it is
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:35.040]  Easier in some ways for apple to generate revenue and it's you know that there's a remarkable story with apples
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.960]  too big of a tangent to go into here, but that apple's uh
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:44.800]  Profit is so high because their margins are so probably the most abnormal thing about apple is a company
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.520]  And there's a lot of things that are abnormal about apple. Are there profit margins on on hardware?
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.560]  and in in in all of these industries
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.440]  Maybe other than watches where the margins are notoriously small the margins are notoriously small
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:07.120]  In the pc market, they're notoriously small in the phone market. I mean they're negative for some of these companies in the cell phone market
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:15.280]  But it is easier for apple to generate just revenue because it's they're selling, you know, $800 phones and
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.440]  $1,500 macbooks, whereas uh facebook is making all that revenue on you know
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.400]  A buck or two at a time on these ad ad views. Yep. No it it no it's it's a remarkable stat. Um,
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.720]  Uh, you actually just dustin posted the profit per employee as well. Oh, did he uh, yeah, it's right below it
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.880]  Uh, so apple will start at the top apple four four hundred and sixty five thousand per employee facebook second second again
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:47.840]  Second second again two hundred ninety thousand per employee, uh, which is again a fantastic number google two hundred fifty thousand per employee
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:55.680]  Microsoft one hundred and two thousand per employee yahoo fifty four thousand per employee and twitter negative one hundred and thirty thousand per employee
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320]  which
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.000]  Twitter's ten years old in right in in a month like
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.400]  That's the problem people think about oh twitter could do this twitter could do that
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:12.000]  The the could do should be happening when you're three years old or you're four years old not when you're ten years old in a public
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:20.160]  Company it is true. I mean, I'd still kind of chalk them up as sort of a newbie, you know that you know, like somehow google is
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.160]  established
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.240]  And facebook even though it's a similar vintage like it acts so mature
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.320]  That it it you give them credit for it and there's some
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.000]  Part of me that has been tricked into giving twitter a little bit more slack on they'll figure it out
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.440]  They're you know, they're still new whereas yeah, it's true. I remember I started my twitter account in 2006. So it's it's ten years
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.560]  Yahoo's just inexcusable. I mean it's the I mean the more I think about it the more I
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.360]  I've rolled my eyes at the fact that the basic story of yahoo's
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.620]  Stock price is that it's entirely based on their holdings in alibaba
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.480]  And if you subtract what their holdings in alibaba are worth yahoo's worth nothing
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:10.080]  Just there's no there is no value in that stuff and I almost feel like i've rolled my eyes at that like come on
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.800]  Lots of people still use yahoo for stuff and now i'm starting to think you know what I think the market has that exactly, right?
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.920]  Yeah, well, I mean there's there's just no there's no growth there at all. It's just shrinking
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.360]  It's these numbers the revenue and earnings are going down every single quarter
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.320]  You know the of the core business and uh, and you know, they're they're probably going to be acquired by verizon
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:37.840]  Acquired by verizon, um, which acquired aol last year, uh, aol actually instead of a missed guy
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.080]  yahoo hired
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.640]  uh marissa meyer, uh with the
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.800]  which
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.280]  Doubled down on the core yahoo problem, which was thinking that they were a tech company
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.640]  Yeah, who's never been a tech company like yahoo started with guys making a list of sites on a page, right?
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.440]  I mean like it's always been a media company
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  um from the beginning and
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:05.760]  Thinking that it was a tech company when it wasn't um, it's the maybe the problem is that they hired the wrong people
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.320]  To to accelerate the growth as a media company. What was the guy who's the ceo terry siegel, right?
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.600]  Like a hollywood guy semel terry semel. Yeah, I think he he yeah
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.400]  No, I think he and that was the vision that he had. I think that's one that would have made more sense. Um,
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.560]  but
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.160]  That's also you have to remember media companies are also all having trouble
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.760]  So say either they would have gotten it right. It's not clear that they would be uh
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.520]  That I mean the the verizon acquisition makes sense aol
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:37.520]  To their credit spent a lot of money developing their programmatic advertising technology. You know, this is kind of like the
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.200]  Um, the the android of ad buying relative to like facebook if facebook's the iphone or google's the iphone
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:50.320]  Uh where your your target and this is what really slaughtered newspapers and sites in general, right? It used to be you would buy
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.480]  You if you wanted to reach someone in daton, ohio, you would buy an ad in the daton newspaper, right?
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.960]  Right now you can just do a programmatic buy where you want to target someone that's in daton, ohio
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.920]  And you can do all these sorts of things and you don't even know where your ad is going to show up
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.960]  It's going to show up on on whatever site it might be and this is a reason why web pages suck
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.280]  I mean we we talked about this last summer. Um
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.920]  Because of this like there's a misalignment where where between the publishers and the advertisers and this sort of thing
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.920]  But just so much more efficient. Um
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.600]  to reach people that way
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:29.120]  Uh, and and so al has the technology there there verizon has lots of interesting data about customers. Um, and uh,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:36.400]  And adding yahoo just to add scale to that product makes sense. Um, i'm sure they'll pay some
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.600]  People will be shocked at how how will the price will end up being?
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.360]  um
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.360]  Yeah, and you know
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.880]  I I know i've mentioned this before too, but it's kind of a fascinating story
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.960]  But the way that newspapers got squeezed at both ends like where newspapers made fundamentally made most of their money
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.760]  In two ways at the very biggest ads the full page ads that were in a section of the newspaper like page
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:07.520]  Three as a full page ad page five and six as a two-page spread from from aces and around the comics in the lifestyle section
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.480]  Yeah
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:13.360]  And then the other huge source of money were the tiny little text classified ads
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.800]  All the way in the back of the newspaper because it was two different things
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:23.200]  the big ones up front was okay macy's has a lot of money and they want to tell everybody in philadelphia that they're having a
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.960]  Two-day memorial day sale. How do you tell everybody in philadelphia?
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.080]  You're having to sell you put a two-page spread ad in the philadelphia inquirer
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.240]  Um the back of the the back of the newspaper ads where the reader is looking for a job
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.880]  Where do you go to look for a job you go to the back of the philadelphia inquirer and you find a tiny little?
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880]  text ad that that uh
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.480]  You know has a job listing and the those classified ads were
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:53.200]  Incredibly lucrative the prices on them were most expensive most expensive ink in the world
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:59.840]  And I and I and they used to price them super smart. I I when I worked at the philadelphia inquirer, uh,
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.440]  You know, I worked with the promotions or the the classified department
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.240]  I used to do graphic design for the little promotional things where they would
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.160]  They would need like if they needed like a flyer for something or whatever I'd do design work
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.840]  Um, they were priced all over the place. So like a three three lines of text in exact
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.800]  You know, the classified ads are all just the same font. You don't get to style it at all
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.960]  Although they would charge you extra if you wanted like bold
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.840]  Right, oh totally right
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:30.240]  So like a help wanted ad was super expensive might be like 150 for like a little three line help wanted ad
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.680]  In the sunday inquirer
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.400]  But if you had if you found somebody's wallet and wanted to just put like a loss in order you lost your wallet
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.240]  You wanted to put like a little lost and found ad in they would charge you like seven dollars
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.840]  They would just take like seven bucks for you to do it
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:48.560]  but they had every ad was sold by a human being who transcribed everything and they could they very very very
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.240]  um
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.240]  they were like, uh
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:57.360]  They were like the police to make sure that nobody tried to sneak a help wanted ad into the lost and found
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.600]  Right just to get away, you know, it was like oh no way, you know, like and they knew you know
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.440]  Each one was way more
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:10.720]  Exposed price right at the pain point for anybody who wants to do something totally and then of course that business just completely washed away
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.280]  Nobody's looking for a job now buys it sunday newspaper
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.800]  Yep
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.520]  No, I i'm young enough that I i've found jobs through classifieds. Um, oh, yeah
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.680]  It was the only way to find a job and it was the only way it was the only way to find an apartment
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.160]  Yep
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.440]  Yeah, no, it's uh, it's yeah. No the newspapers are screwed
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.160]  um, there's I mean, I guess the only other way the only other way you could find an apartment was to like walk through the
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:39.440]  Walk up and down the streets of philadelphia and see if anybody had like a rooms for rent sign in front of their building
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.200]  That was the only other way that there wasn't anything else. No, it looked like savages
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.360]  Uh, let me take one more break and thank our final sponsor of the day and it is our good friends at fracture
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:58.320]  Fracture is a company that prints photos directly onto glass colors pop like you won't believe and it even comes
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.920]  On a solid backing that is ready to mount right out of the package
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.240]  All you have to do is stick the included screw in the wall and then you just hang it up and you're done
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.800]  So it's not like a photo that you then go buy a frame put it in a frame and hand frame
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.600]  It's everything you need to put it up on a wall
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.800]  Uh or for the smaller ones to like prop them up on your desk or on a mantle or something like that
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:25.840]  It's all right there and in the packaging. It's like the actual thing that they ship the the glass bin is
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.120]  You take it apart and there it is and it you can hang it right in the wall
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:35.840]  It's super super clever and it looks super super sharp because you don't have this border from a frame or any kind of mat around it
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.360]  It's just the rectangle itself is just like edge to edge the photo. It is amazing
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.880]  And the quality is really really great. I can't
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:50.400]  the ease of use is amazing because you don't have to like stick your photo in a frame and get it to to look square and
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:56.640]  All lined up and not uh rotate slightly by like one degree as you close the frame up or anything like that
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.000]  So there's a huge convenience factor
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.200]  but there's also a factor which is that it looks as good or better than any way of
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:09.360]  Printing your photos that i've ever seen it's really great quality and it's all really affordable too with prices starting at just 15 bucks for
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  the smallest uh square size
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:17.600]  They make great gifts and they are the perfect way to celebrate a shared memory with
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:26.240]  Any of your friends and family and it's really really a great idea as all of our photos are digital these days
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.400]  it really is for me personally, it's it's just so great and and it
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.680]  I can't say it. You know, it's hard to put in the words
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.040]  How great it is to take your very favorite photos of the people that you know, that you know, that you know
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.480]  the people that mean the most to you and turn them into something analog something that isn't
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.600]  Powered by a battery and doesn't glow and it's just like a nice little artifact that you can do something with
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.480]  Each fracture is hand assembled and checked for quality by the small team in gainesville florida that does this
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.240]  um
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.720]  and if you need any other reason to buy one, you know, whether you're somebody who's already bought one before or
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.760]  If you've never checked them out
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.840]  But you've heard me talk about them you can get 10 off using the code talk show 10 all one word talk show
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.320]  one zero talk show 10
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.660]  Uh, and you will save 10 off any order big or small at fractureme.com
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  So my thanks to them
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.680]  Uh, what else we have what else has been going on
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.480]  Well, I was I mean I was on vacation last week so I missed some stuff but there was um, uh
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.400]  I mean there's earnings which is I spend a lot of time on
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.520]  yeah, we might as well I talked about a little bit last week, but I you know, it's
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.200]  it's
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.120]  interesting
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.080]  Oh, well apple. I mean I I have my um
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:53.680]  I'm a little bit actually on a on a whim here, but I thought the apple earnings were fine. Um,
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.480]  I think the
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.080]  the
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.960]  What I did I I did this in a daily update, but I went back and I charted
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:09.600]  uh all or I put down all of apple's earnings starting from I think 2010 on because I think that was
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.000]  No 2011 is when they changed
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.400]  But basically I did and no I did the iphone all along but did annual earnings like the amount they earned each year
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:22.260]  Because it's hard to do quarter on quarter comparisons with the iphone because apple shifted when they launched it in 2011
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:29.140]  And also china in particular in particular changed the dates the quarters that it launched in so I just did annual
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.620]  annual revenue and uh and
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.420]  annual revenue for for for apple
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.660]  um or for the iphone specifically
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.920]  And if you charted revenue from 2008 to 2014
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:44.260]  And then you use that to forecast
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.060]  uh to forecast
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  2015 and 2016
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.280]  uh apple
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.620]  significantly
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.700]  outperformed
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:27:00.820]  Uh, what you would expect them to in 2016, so their their earnings that they just reported 2016 quarter one were
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.780]  Were what something like 20 billion or the revenue was like like some significant number?
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:10.580]  I should probably open the I wrote it all down, uh was well above what you would expect it to be
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.420]  um
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.940]  the problem
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:18.660]  quote-unquote problem was that the first quarter last year was so
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:22.200]  Unbelievably massive. It was like 50 or 60
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:28.600]  Billion more than you would expect or something like that, right that it it the the year-over-year comparison
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:34.600]  They barely beat last year. And actually if you look at the inventory numbers and the sell-through numbers, they probably
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:43.320]  Slightly slightly under form is very close. Uh, and they're going to under form next quarter. Uh, and and I look at that and
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.480]  I
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.880]  Don't buy the iphone has peaked narrative
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:55.160]  Um, I think that apple there was a one-time event that there was a combination of polling sales forward
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:02.520]  Like people upgraded earlier than they would have but if that was all that was happening then the sales this year would have been
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.320]  significantly less than they were right the fact that they managed to stay the same and
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.360]  If looking backwards were well above what you would have expected in 2014
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:19.480]  Suggest that they really did take a huge chunk of non iPhone customers. They had a bunch of new customers to Apple and
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.800]  Those customers Apple has fantastic retention numbers people who buy an iPhone buy another iPhone that
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.760]  Suggests that the iPhones growth is going to continue
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:37.240]  And so I think that this year Apple and I'm not again. I'm not a stock analyst. I say that a lot
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  I don't get in trouble
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:44.000]  But I think it's gonna be down this year because the year-over-year comparison are gonna be tough
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  but actually I
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.320]  Think that they're in a lot better shape than people think in that 2017 is gonna be is gonna be a much better year
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.920]  For them and I feel like they go through this on a regular
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:05.000]  Cyclical basis because the last downturn was around sometime in calendar 2013
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.640]  And it's like a year after Steve Jobs died and everybody was banging the drum on you know
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.200]  they're doomed without Steve Jobs and
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.280]  Samsung was putting in record numbers, and there was this narrative that
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.680]  You know and there was there wasn't even a little bit of truth to it
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:33.480]  Which is that there was clearly consumer demand for big phones and Apple's biggest phone was four inches, which wasn't big
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.440]  So that was actually a true part of it
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.000]  I mean that even came out in the lawsuit where there was an email
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.840]  I think from Phil Schiller that was like in entered into evidence
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.960]  but it said you know people want big phones, and we don't have big phones right now and
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.240]  This narrative was that you know
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:56.640]  Apple's time at the top is over and Samsung's eating their lunch and the stock was really depressed and then all of a sudden you
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.640]  know the
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:04.320]  iPhone 6 comes out, and it's a huge hit and it's like oh the Apple's back, but it's really you know
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.080]  It was all very predictable. It was you know they just sort of got there there the long time frame that they have to
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:18.960]  You know the downside of wow they sell 75 million phones in the first quarter when they're did that
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.400]  they've been made available is that the way that you can do that is by having the pipeline be like 18 months long and
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.120]  They got caught behind that the pipeline on when they could come out with
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.240]  Close to 5-inch phone and a over 5-inch phone
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.800]  Was behind that the market moved faster than they did and there was an art
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.520]  But then the rumors came out and therefore there was also this
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.560]  Clearly a lot of a lot of casual people not people like us
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.200]  You know go and check out Mac rumors calm every day and see what stuff like that
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:54.280]  But just normal people we were like I hear Apple's coming out with a big phone. I'm gonna wait. Mm-hmm
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.720]  Yeah, the thing the thing the thing that where it's different now
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.340]  I think those are all spot-on and and that year 2014 was down a bit
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:09.520]  Relatively speaking, but they the Apple was still growing right there there the difference now is
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.240]  it is an
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:19.000]  Objective fact that iPhone sales are flat and right next quarter and we're going to go down so I think that
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.640]  The the narrative back then I think was fueled by this
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.880]  Misguided
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.160]  understanding of
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:35.340]  Why Apple maintain is able to maintain those margins and profits, and I think people are a little smarter about that now
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:39.880]  I mean that's where I really got you know got my start. You know I wrote a
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:47.400]  A big thing saying like why disruption advocates got Apple Apple so wrong and actually one of my earliest pieces was predicting that
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.680]  Samsung was in for a big fall
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.200]  and I mean but
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.840]  Relatively speaking for people who understood Apple how it worked
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:00.640]  There was a little bit of shooting fish in the barrel right and the and the numbers were on our side
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.280]  Apple was still growing the big difference now is is objectively speaking the numbers are going down
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.960]  but you can't ignore the fact that
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.480]  like
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:16.080]  Last year was so unbelievably extraordinary. I mean the numbers were just off the charts and
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:23.520]  And it on one hand it's gonna always be hard to compare to other numbers
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.640]  But if you take out that one year this year is still better than would be expected
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:35.040]  And I think that's that key point is being missed and so yeah, so like what you're saying
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.480]  let's just say we take out the 2015 numbers we take them out and
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.040]  We leave in
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120]  2012 13 14
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:50.560]  Yep, 15 to blank and now we go and we show the first of 2016 and then we say now you draw an imaginary line
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.920]  For where you think?
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.840]  2015
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.560]  Went based on what you saw at the end of 2014 and where we are now
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.440]  And you probably just draw like this night. It looks like a real nice slope
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.000]  Yeah
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.800]  I have these exact numbers actually if you do if you forecast linearly from 2008 those of 14
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.400]  Then 2015 you would have expected to sell
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:12.720]  200 million if you do logistic regression like an s-curve which it actually the data would suggest
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.400]  Then you would expect 178 million Apple actually sold 230 million
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:24.620]  So they they exceeded what you would have forecast by 30 to 50 million iPhones
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:30.380]  Which would like a really strong quarter like an entire really good for iPhones. That's more iPhones
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:35.560]  They sold in 2010 right and like more than they sold in any quarter other than the holiday quarter, right?
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:41.440]  I mean it was in it was insane and and and it's like they just added a quarter to their calendar
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:44.000]  Yeah in in in a single quarter
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.520]  And so if you did that same sort of thing and you projected again, you only had data up 2014
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.960]  You said oh, what do you think's gonna be in 2016 again if you do a win here?
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.320]  Which it'd be 230 million if you do a win your regression
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.200]  It would be a which sorry logistic regression
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:08.360]  It would be a 184 million because sales were it looked like they were peaking and they were flattening out in 2014
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.400]  Apple is on pace to sell about 230 million
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:18.680]  So either they're right on track with growth if you use a win here or they're vastly exceeding it if you think that growth had
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.040]  peaked in 2014
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.240]  regardless the fact matter is like there's there's actually not much evidence that
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.720]  the only way this story makes sense is if Apple got a bunch of new customers like
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:34.160]  In 2015 in a one-time event and it's like well, is there any explanation for that to happen there?
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.080]  in fact, I'm glad you asked there is they got finally got big screen iPhones and
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.800]  4g really came online in China is the other real big factor. Yeah. Yeah and China
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.660]  Basic economy. I mean, I know it's it's not having a good time right now, but in the grand scheme of things though
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.660]  It's just doing well
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:57.660]  Yeah, the grand scheme things. I mean there's there's hundreds of millions of people entering the middle class
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.700]  I mean like the scale of China is is is hard is hard to comprehend
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:07.020]  It's but it's it's it's very large Tim. Actually. This is a point of satisfaction Tim Cook now
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:09.460]  I've always quotes this McKinsey study about
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:13.660]  About the number of middle-class people coming in China, which he never quoted
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.380]  until until I
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.980]  Earnings call a couple quarters ago and I happen to have included in a daily update before then
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.540]  So I don't think he read it
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:27.060]  But I like to think that someone found the link and then and then for it
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:32.140]  It's been it's been in every earnings call ever since it's like it's a relatively obscure study. Um
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.140]  But that's like that's how I put myself to bed at night
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:43.260]  So here's an iPhone related thing and I wanted to I knew I wanted to shoot it past you and see what you have to
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.260]  say a
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:46.860]  reader
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:53.940]  Let me try to paraphrase it is let's say the a let's let's accept that the rumors about next month's new
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:59.460]  iPhone are true that there's a new four inch model that supposedly called the 5se
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.580]  look, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, but
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.860]  Let's just say a lot of Apple's names. Don't ya?
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.460]  And
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:15.780]  It's four inches and it has the specs more or less of an iPhone 6 meaning it has an a
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:17.300]  a
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.500]  Wait, what are we up to that 6s?
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:27.860]  Yeah, 6s has an a9 processor. So that's the state-of-the-art. It has so what it has is an a8 processor
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.660]  The current 5s the 4-inch phone that you could go in and buy today has
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.820]  As the a7 as the first 64-bit a7
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:48.460]  So it goes to an a8 processor and has a camera roughly equivalent to the iphone 6
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.420]  It's more or less like a 4-inch version of the iphone 6
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:55.740]  And it'll probably sell for out, you know, same price point $100 less
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.860]  So the question from the reader is
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:04.260]  Have they backed themselves into a corner and they have to use this year-old
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:13.420]  A8 processor and camera specs because they have to hit this hundred dollar or less than the iphone 6 price slot or
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:18.980]  Is this was this part of the have they painted themselves in the corner or have they deliberately chosen?
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.940]  To set up that corner because that's what they wanted all along
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:27.220]  I mean, I think that there's the idea of
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:34.140]  Of having the better specs and the more expensive phone. I think we're asking. Why don't they make a a
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:43.700]  Price $650 5-inch or 4-inch phone, right? I think that that what's underlying the the question did that because I've always priced by size
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:49.620]  Right sort of thing. Yeah, and I thought that it speaks to people's that there's some number of people out there who really still want
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.620]  a 4-inch phone, but they also want that the
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:57.820]  Top-of-the-line specs. Yeah, there's probably an aspect to that
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:02.180]  I mean Apple Apple has always gone for the sort of like easy to explain pricing
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:08.100]  you know, like iPods were you know, or even iPhones by memory right like which is
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:11.940]  Which is very easy to explain and very profitable
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:19.380]  It doesn't make a lot of sense given it doesn't make it easy at all. Well, it makes a ton of sense
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:24.060]  It all well, it makes a ton of sense actually makes a ton of sense perspective because right
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.140]  But it doesn't make sense that it's being priced
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:32.780]  I'm not even fairly is not quite the right word, but but in it commensurate with the price of the components, right?
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:35.100]  Well, this is something people always get tripped up on right?
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.220]  I mean our price is what the market will bear it has nothing to do with what goes into
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.780]  You know what goes in the products? I think that's I think that's probably
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:48.020]  Yes, I think you can look at that apples in a corner in that they
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:51.180]  Given the way they do their pricing
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:54.420]  It should be less and that sort of thing
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.780]  You know that said
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:05.780]  That's it I think it's fair I think it's a it's a fair thing to say but I think it also fits their strategy
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.740]  I mean, yeah, I don't think that they found themselves here accidentally though and that they're like ooh, you know
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.820]  Like they you know, like the the analogy of painting yourself in a corner is that you turn around you realize?
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:18.340]  Oh, I did not leave myself a way out here and you didn't think about it when you got started
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:24.380]  I think they knew exactly what they were doing and they know that yes that this means that anybody who wants a four-inch phone
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.540]  with top-of-the-line specs
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:33.940]  Does not get that but why are they watching it in the spring? That's kind of weird. Was it just not ready or I
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.580]  Wait here. I'll tell you what I I'll tell you what I'll tell you one thing. I think it's interesting
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:40.960]  I think that Apple did have the strategy to
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.120]  To because a big where they did the 5c
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.680]  The 5c
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.640]  was
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:54.720]  Cheaper to produce than the 5 was that was that was I don't think that was any question
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.120]  That was an important part of it. And I think I suspect Apple wanted to keep the 5c around longer than they did
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:09.320]  yeah, but I think what Apple learned from that is that it didn't it it screamed that this is not
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.320]  This is a cheap iPhone, right?
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.120]  it was obviously a cheap iPhone you could if whereas if you bought a
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.600]  The $450 iPhone the lowest one that was available
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:24.860]  No one knew if that was you bought it because it's a cheap iPhone you or you it was just your expensive iPhone
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:26.720]  That was two years old or when you told or whatever, right?
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:33.160]  But it was still an iPhone the 5c was never an iPhone in the way that every other iPhone has been an iPhone because it
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.160]  was never the flagship and
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.600]  And sorry go ahead. No, you know you go in and so I think Apple wants to
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.940]  The I think that there's things to lend itself to the 5c strategy was cheaper to produce
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.280]  You know
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.320]  They're using components that out there that they've all let the warning curve. They're producing them super cheaply
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:56.420]  I think they want that from an operational perspective. They want to go lower market
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:59.960]  I think they would like to have like a $350 phone for like India, for example
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:06.100]  Um, but they but they've learned they need to retain the this is an iPhone
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.600]  Sensibility and I think they're trying to figure that out. I suspect that's that goes into
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.440]  the the 5 se and they're trying to find the right balance where how can we get all the benefits of
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:23.600]  Building a phone from scratch to be cheaper as opposed to just using an expensive phone and selling it forever
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.200]  But still maintain the this is the iPhone sort of aura
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.880]  I think that the timing is exactly on plan and I think it makes a ton of sense
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.200]  And I think it's because at the low end at the high end these phones
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.480]  Very consistent ever since they moved to releasing them in September instead of late June early July
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:47.260]  They have an almost clockwork 12-month cycle. They like ever since they moved to September
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:52.240]  It's the exact same week of September that they have the event somewhere around September 10th
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.240]  And then they come out 11 days later
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.880]  I'd like the 21st or something like that which within a week every single year. It's 12 months
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.640]  You have a 12-month clock ticking on top of the line
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:07.120]  The bottom of the line does not have a 12-month cycle right now the 5s
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.920]  has been there for 18 months or
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:19.520]  It's been out more than that 30 months. Well that it's been at the spot where it's at first. Oh got it. Got it
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.520]  Okay, right
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:28.060]  No six months you because it was the 5c the 5c was sold until last September
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:33.380]  Well, I just yeah
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:37.180]  Holds no, I think I don't know anyway
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:39.660]  My point is that I think that this new phone that they're coming out with in March
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:44.420]  They expect to be there for at least 18 months. It'll be there for a long time or I agree. I agree
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:48.400]  No, I that's exactly I was trying to say I think they want to go below the 450 price point
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.580]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be there if the 5c was supposed to do that
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:55.280]  But they it was a flop and so this is the second attempt at it
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:02.460]  I'm curious still curious very I'm really curious about this event next month. I'm more more interested in it than any event
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:08.860]  in the last year, I think because I have no idea how they're gonna sell this stuff because to me it's
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:17.340]  The rumors are of stuff that could easily be released by press release, you know, it's there's here
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:23.860]  Here's a you know camera quality you've seen before and performance quality that you've seen before in a size that you've seen before
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.740]  And I think it's an important part of their product lineup to have it there
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:33.260]  And I know that part of the reason that they're doing this is it is a nicer phone at four inches than the current 5s
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:39.940]  And it fits their overall strategy because now this one will work with Apple pay and the 5s that does have touch ID
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:45.180]  But it does not support Apple pay. So now they've got an entire lineup of phones that supports Apple pay and
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.180]  You
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:53.400]  Know and I think it can be on the market for a while and they don't have to distract from last September's
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.540]  Hey, here's the brand new success and success plus and we have to take five minutes and tell you about this thing that we're not
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.100]  even that excited about
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:05.260]  And they don't have to do it again this September when they have this iPhone 7 which you know
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:08.940]  Who knows what it's going to do and who knows what the selling points will be but they don't have to mention it all they
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.740]  Have to do it's the only time it'll get mentioned is at the very end when they talk about pricing and they'll say
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:21.020]  This the 7 plus starts at this price the 7 starts $100 less at this price and
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:26.140]  $100 less here's the you know, we still have the 5 SE or 6
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:31.780]  Yeah, well we fascinating to see is will the iPhone 6 still exists next September, right?
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.340]  Yeah, that would be 7 6 s and 5 SE, right?
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.020]  It I think I do think that's where they want to go like right that might be whether right
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:46.660]  They would rather have the low-end phone be built to be a low-end phone because there's like if you build it from scratch
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.340]  You you again using no technologies
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:55.460]  But I bet you can produce it cheaper they can and they can build it to be a phone that's meant to go even further
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:59.720]  to our market and I won't be surprised a year later then you have the 7s the 7 the
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:06.240]  And then a new like a 6 SE. Yeah, and then and you still have the 5 SE
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.980]  I really think they want to go below that 450 price point
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.500]  Um, they have to it just needs to be an iPhone
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:18.300]  Yeah, and I kind of feel like they they you know, and again everything gets old and slow at some point
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.820]  But I kind of feel like a 8 with the 64-bit CPU
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.500]  and the
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.780]  NFC for touch ID
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:31.220]  I mean for Apple Apple pay with touch ID that it's a camera that that that could remain
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:37.100]  Relevant as the as the price point slowly dips over the next 18 months to 24 months
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:41.500]  It'll still be a credible phone. Yep. Totally agree. Ah
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.360]  Anything else do you see that while we were recording they came out with
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:53.820]  Twitter has a new feature that was rumored that they're going to let you have a setting that you can flip that will
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.780]  Show you tweets that they think are relevant to you at the top of your timeline
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:06.300]  And yeah, I I try to get I haven't gotten the setting on my account yet. I don't know if I'm international
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:11.220]  Jack Jack's tweet says just keep hitting refresh
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:16.500]  Just keep refreshing. It's like just keep refreshing until you get the setting
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.540]  That's funny
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:25.220]  The yeah, I mean, we'll see. I mean it's it's opt-in for now
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:29.580]  I think it's gonna be is gonna be it opt-out after a few weeks
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:37.860]  Some testing. Um, I like while you were away personally. Um, I've I long ago gave up on reading all my tweets
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.900]  Yeah, me too. And I think people who read all their tweets
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.560]  You probably use third-party clients anyway
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.880]  Just try to read all your tweets in the in the regular Twitter client is a hopeless cause because it doesn't save its spot
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.900]  So, yeah, I mean again
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:57.300]  I think I think I I think it's fine and it would have been sorely needed
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:03.100]  Seven eight years ago. I think they need to be careful about losing what they have now. Yeah
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:10.860]  It's again. I will I like comparing I like the newspaper comparison again because newspaper news is more
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:15.860]  widespread and popular and and value in were
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:21.740]  Valuable than it has ever been and Twitter like we the reason we talked about Twitter wiggly the amount of
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.780]  verbiage spent on Twitter relative to its importance in like the
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:32.140]  from a business perspective or all that sort of stuff is way out of whack, but it's so it I
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:35.260]  Love it. I know you love it and it's so
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:41.660]  Much part of a fabric of everything particularly politics and sports. I'm a huge NBA fan and NBA Twitter is
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:49.180]  Amazing. It's like this whole it's really the best the like the the the best possible manifestation of what Twitter could be
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.180]  But again, it's almost it's hard to get into your fair who to follow you get all the things in order
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:58.300]  But did man, how do you like just how do you make how do you make money off that?
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.500]  Let's face will figure it out
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:11.380]  Ben Thompson, thank you for your time. I'm blown away. I don't know about you
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:17.380]  I've I mean you're just for people who don't know we're recording from Philadelphia and Taipei
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:20.660]  I know so it's it's 1230
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:28.860]  Noon here and and we were talking about in our lives. We had to find jobs by reading three three
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.540]  Line tiny bits of text in the back of the newspaper, right? It is what like 1 30 a.m
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:39.660]  Yeah, why they and this Skype call has had zero latency
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.660]  It's unbelievable. It's I
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:46.540]  Don't just even if it fell apart now, I could just stop the recording and we could have to just have the show
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:48.540]  but I don't have to knock on wood, but
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:55.700]  I'm actually kind of blown away at the living in the future aspect of the recording of this episode of the show people can find
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.700]  Your stuff at the excellent
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.220]  Strateck re.com
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:05.780]  You could also probably just google Ben Thompson and it's gonna take you right there. Yeah
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:11.900]  And your Twitter account, there's Ben Thompson at Ben Thompson at Ben Thompson and and
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:17.620]  Podcasts exponent exponent FM. Yeah, if you like better the sound of Ben's voice if you go to exponent FM
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.940]  There's a pretty good podcast right there. Thank you for your time and thank you for
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:36.060]  Thank you for your time and thank you for for your insight. No, it's always a pleasure. If you think you have IBS with diarrhea talk to your doctor about new xyphaxone
