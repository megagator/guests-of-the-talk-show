[00:00.000 --> 00:02.660]  Do you know one of the most delicious little details
[00:02.660 --> 00:07.100]  of this is that Wikipedia now has to do a redirect
[00:07.100 --> 00:10.540]  because they previously had an article, Trump Impeachment.
[00:10.540 --> 00:13.040]  And now they have to.
[00:13.040 --> 00:18.040]  Which Impeachment did you mean?
[00:20.100 --> 00:23.100]  Did you see the Dojo tweet?
[00:23.100 --> 00:24.060]  I don't think so.
[00:24.980 --> 00:28.540]  I just tweeted this out, a friend of mine found it.
[00:28.540 --> 00:33.540]  It's a Don Trump Jr. tweet from 2016.
[00:35.660 --> 00:37.980]  Dear Clinton's, you know what's deplorable?
[00:37.980 --> 00:39.020]  Being impeached.
[00:39.020 --> 00:43.020]  Hashtag basket of deplorables.
[00:43.020 --> 00:44.220]  Oh man.
[00:44.220 --> 00:47.660]  But amidst all of this news, did you see the story today?
[00:47.660 --> 00:49.660]  I wanna start with some light fare.
[00:49.660 --> 00:53.820]  Do you see the story today about Jared and Ivanka's
[00:53.820 --> 00:55.880]  Secret Service detail not being allowed to use
[00:55.880 --> 00:57.280]  the restrooms in their home?
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.720]  No.
[00:58.720 --> 01:01.600]  Yeah, so there's a story in the Washington Post.
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.480]  I will put this in the show notes, I promise.
[01:03.480 --> 01:06.180]  But the basic gist is they have a very large home
[01:06.180 --> 01:08.360]  in a very nice neighborhood in Washington
[01:08.360 --> 01:11.960]  and they've forbade the Secret Service
[01:11.960 --> 01:14.120]  from using their restrooms.
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.280]  And the Secret Service therefore rented a basement
[01:17.280 --> 01:19.760]  studio apartment somewhere on their block
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.780]  just to have access to the toilet.
[01:21.780 --> 01:23.760]  And it cost $3,000 a month.
[01:23.760 --> 01:27.200]  So over $100,000 since 2017.
[01:27.200 --> 01:28.860]  You know what I hate about that?
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.420]  What I hate about that is that it almost humanizes them.
[01:34.420 --> 01:36.120]  I mean, you've had work done in your home.
[01:36.120 --> 01:37.040]  No, we have.
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.120]  Do you want people taking dumps in your bathroom?
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.120]  We're lucky, the new place we're in,
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.040]  we have a bunch of restrooms.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.800]  We've got powder rooms on every floor.
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.040]  I mean, that's the way you make a house.
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.040]  When I grew up, we had one toilet.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.960]  Or actually, we had one in the basement.
[01:52.960 --> 01:57.960]  The basement one was not good, not comfortable.
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.560]  I found a rifle in the drop ceiling
[02:04.160 --> 02:07.000]  of our basement toilet when I was a teenager.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.940]  And do you know whose it was?
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.600]  Your brother's probably?
[02:10.600 --> 02:12.440]  Yeah, it was my brother's.
[02:12.440 --> 02:15.600]  Because like a normal teenager,
[02:15.600 --> 02:17.640]  that's where I stashed my porn.
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.800]  That's a good hiding spot for porn.
[02:19.800 --> 02:22.080]  It is, it's the best hiding spot.
[02:22.080 --> 02:25.600]  And it turns out that that's where he was stashing his guns.
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.960]  Anyway, but lower in the story.
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.560]  And again, I like to filter these things through a,
[02:35.560 --> 02:38.080]  okay, what if it was somebody I liked?
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.640]  What if it wasn't the Kushner's,
[02:39.640 --> 02:42.240]  if it was the Obamas or somebody?
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.800]  Is it unreasonable not to want the Secret Service
[02:44.800 --> 02:45.860]  to use your restroom?
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.000]  Now, part of the problem,
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.720]  I think the optics problem for them,
[02:48.720 --> 02:50.240]  is that it's a very large house,
[02:50.240 --> 02:52.000]  apparently with a lot of restrooms.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.040]  So they wouldn't, quite possibly,
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.380]  they could have made arrangements
[02:56.380 --> 02:59.340]  that they could have used a restroom
[02:59.340 --> 03:01.760]  and not really disturb their families.
[03:01.760 --> 03:03.840]  The Obamas would have totally let them use their restroom.
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.680]  Well, listen to this.
[03:04.680 --> 03:07.040]  Here, I'm quoting from the story.
[03:07.040 --> 03:09.160]  They had a port-a-potty for a while,
[03:09.160 --> 03:11.840]  and the neighbors out in the sidewalk,
[03:11.840 --> 03:14.100]  and the neighbors raised a stink,
[03:14.100 --> 03:16.720]  because I guess the port-a-potty raises a stink.
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.560]  And then they did this.
[03:17.560 --> 03:20.200]  So the port-a-potty, this is from the story,
[03:20.200 --> 03:22.360]  was the agency's initial solution
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.920]  to the protective details dilemma,
[03:23.920 --> 03:25.480]  but it was removed in the face
[03:25.480 --> 03:26.840]  of the neighborhood's protests.
[03:26.840 --> 03:29.760]  After that, according to the law enforcement officials,
[03:29.760 --> 03:32.360]  the agents began using a bathroom
[03:32.360 --> 03:35.200]  in a garage at the Obamas' house,
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.680]  which the former president's protective detail
[03:39.680 --> 03:41.560]  had turned into a command post.
[03:41.560 --> 03:43.840]  The Obamas did not use the garage.
[03:43.840 --> 03:45.240]  I guess they don't drive.
[03:45.240 --> 03:48.080]  So the extra traffic to and from the command post
[03:48.080 --> 03:49.440]  caused no problem.
[03:49.440 --> 03:52.680]  Yet this solution, too, was short-lived
[03:52.680 --> 03:54.960]  after a Secret Service supervisor
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.440]  from the Trump-Kushner detail
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.040]  left an unpleasant mess in the Obama bathroom
[04:01.040 --> 04:03.720]  at some point before the fall of 2017,
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.420]  according to a person briefed on the event.
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.500]  That prompted the leaders of the Obama detail
[04:11.500 --> 04:15.920]  to ban the agents up the street from ever returning.
[04:15.920 --> 04:16.760]  You can't.
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.680]  That's embarrassing.
[04:17.680 --> 04:20.040]  Can you even imagine?
[04:20.040 --> 04:20.880]  How do you?
[04:20.880 --> 04:22.000]  I mean, you can't.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.520]  Briefed on the event.
[04:23.520 --> 04:24.640]  The event.
[04:26.200 --> 04:29.840]  That's a call with a boss that you never wanna have.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.160]  So, Ted, we've had some complaints
[04:35.160 --> 04:37.160]  about you wrecking a bathroom.
[04:37.160 --> 04:39.760]  And let's see, let me check my notes here.
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.840]  The Obamas' bathroom.
[04:41.840 --> 04:44.560]  I need more details about this event.
[04:44.560 --> 04:48.500]  I need an entire story about this.
[04:48.500 --> 04:49.720]  This needs.
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.120]  Well, I'm thinking, if I'm Secret Service
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.760]  and I'm using Kushner's bathroom, I'm wrecking it.
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.340]  That might be the right word.
[05:00.340 --> 05:02.220]  I'm wrecking it on purpose.
[05:03.160 --> 05:05.520]  What, are you going to Taco Bell beforehand?
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.880]  Well, I'm like shoving yams in the toilet.
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.100]  Like, fuck these people.
[05:12.100 --> 05:13.000]  Fuck these people.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.940]  Fuck their plumbing.
[05:14.940 --> 05:17.000]  Fuck everything about them.
[05:17.000 --> 05:17.880]  I'm gonna wreck this bathroom.
[05:17.880 --> 05:21.040]  We've all had moments with an unpleasant.
[05:22.960 --> 05:25.400]  We've all had unfortunate incidents with toilets.
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.920]  And of course, and you're in a guest.
[05:28.920 --> 05:29.760]  You may not know.
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.400]  You might have a moment where you think,
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.460]  well, there's gotta be a plunger.
[05:33.460 --> 05:34.780]  Everybody keeps a plunger.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.800]  You gotta have a plunger.
[05:37.800 --> 05:38.800]  I'm amazed.
[05:38.800 --> 05:42.240]  I'm amazed how often there isn't a plunger.
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.200]  And look, I like to leave a clean bowl.
[05:47.160 --> 05:49.520]  Whatever I do, I like to leave a clean bowl
[05:49.520 --> 05:51.100]  because one, I don't want people thinking
[05:51.100 --> 05:54.000]  that I wasn't house trained.
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.900]  And two, it's just common courtesy for the next rider.
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.840]  And that means sometimes a plunger, always a brush.
[06:04.840 --> 06:05.680]  You got to.
[06:05.680 --> 06:06.880]  How can you?
[06:06.880 --> 06:07.960]  You got to.
[06:07.960 --> 06:11.680]  You don't wanna leave any evidence of what you did in there.
[06:11.680 --> 06:14.600]  Nobody should have to come into a bathroom
[06:14.600 --> 06:16.400]  and see what somebody else did.
[06:18.920 --> 06:20.100]  Briefed on the event.
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.960]  I want, I would like the great Olivia Nuzzi
[06:24.960 --> 06:28.280]  to research this as, this incident
[06:28.280 --> 06:33.280]  in the Obama's garage restroom as her next investigation.
[06:33.520 --> 06:37.600]  You know, you saw, I'm sure, her piece
[06:37.600 --> 06:42.080]  on the Four Seasons Total Landscaping, correct?
[06:42.080 --> 06:42.920]  I love that piece.
[06:42.920 --> 06:45.960]  She should win an award for digging into sometimes.
[06:45.960 --> 06:46.960]  She should.
[06:46.960 --> 06:48.600]  To me, there's two stories to write.
[06:48.600 --> 06:51.200]  There's the big story, right?
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.920]  The trunk of the tree.
[06:52.920 --> 06:56.320]  And then the leaves, the individual leaves.
[06:56.320 --> 06:58.600]  And there's so many stories.
[06:59.840 --> 07:01.720]  There's so many stories that could be written here.
[07:01.720 --> 07:05.200]  Now this, the Four Seasons Total Landscaping,
[07:05.200 --> 07:08.840]  I presume everybody listening is vaguely familiar with this.
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.720]  This was in the immediate aftermath of the election.
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.660]  And Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani,
[07:16.660 --> 07:20.560]  called a press conference that Trump tweeted out
[07:20.560 --> 07:23.380]  as being at the Four Seasons Philadelphia.
[07:23.380 --> 07:25.120]  And then had.
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.840]  Technically true.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.560]  Then sent out a correction,
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.820]  Four Seasons Total Landscaping exclamation mark.
[07:31.820 --> 07:36.100]  Oh, but between that, between the tweet and the correction,
[07:36.100 --> 07:38.420]  there was a tweet from the Four Seasons
[07:38.420 --> 07:41.300]  that was basically, fuck no.
[07:41.300 --> 07:42.140]  Well.
[07:42.140 --> 07:44.460]  You curse on the show.
[07:44.460 --> 07:45.980]  Yeah, you can curse.
[07:45.980 --> 07:46.820]  Okay.
[07:48.180 --> 07:50.060]  But you're from Philadelphia.
[07:50.060 --> 07:51.220]  And so it.
[07:51.220 --> 07:52.060]  I am.
[07:52.060 --> 07:54.380]  And specifically, you grew up in the Northeast,
[07:54.380 --> 07:56.180]  which is actually where Four Seasons.
[07:56.180 --> 07:57.980]  Oh, don't say that, don't say that.
[07:57.980 --> 07:59.220]  That's a hate crime.
[07:59.220 --> 08:01.380]  I grew up in Olney.
[08:01.380 --> 08:03.660]  Well, you're familiar with the Northeast, though.
[08:03.660 --> 08:06.260]  I'm very familiar with the Northeast,
[08:06.260 --> 08:10.500]  and I'm very familiar with the neighborhood
[08:10.500 --> 08:13.060]  that Four Seasons Total Landscaping is in
[08:13.060 --> 08:14.460]  because there's a jail there.
[08:14.460 --> 08:15.300]  What?
[08:16.900 --> 08:19.780]  That wasn't mentioned in the remarks.
[08:19.780 --> 08:21.820]  Everybody just mentioned the porn shop
[08:21.820 --> 08:24.280]  and the crematorium across the street.
[08:25.180 --> 08:26.700]  Well, there's a jail in that neighborhood,
[08:26.700 --> 08:28.500]  and that's where we used to go to visit my brother.
[08:28.500 --> 08:31.460]  Oh, the brother who stashed a rifle.
[08:32.660 --> 08:33.820]  Exactly.
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.620]  Along with your girly magazines.
[08:36.660 --> 08:39.060]  It's your standard fuck around
[08:39.060 --> 08:40.700]  and find out Philadelphia story.
[08:40.700 --> 08:42.360]  So my favorite little side note
[08:42.360 --> 08:45.240]  of the Four Seasons Total Landscaping thing is,
[08:45.240 --> 08:48.260]  and you know, Center City, Philadelphia is very small
[08:48.260 --> 08:50.220]  for a major metropolitan city.
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.960]  It's literally walkable
[08:52.960 --> 08:55.700]  because where Center City, Philadelphia is,
[08:55.700 --> 08:58.180]  with the handshake deal that William Penn had
[08:58.180 --> 09:02.260]  with the, I guess they were the Schuylkill Native Americans,
[09:02.260 --> 09:04.180]  but you know, it was whatever he could walk
[09:04.180 --> 09:06.840]  in an afternoon would be the city,
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.620]  and he walked from river to river.
[09:09.620 --> 09:10.840]  But it's tiny.
[09:11.860 --> 09:13.260]  It broke that deal later.
[09:13.260 --> 09:14.980]  Well, we don't have to go into that,
[09:14.980 --> 09:19.980]  but it is by definition a walkable Center City.
[09:20.100 --> 09:20.940]  It is very walkable.
[09:20.940 --> 09:25.300]  So we were close to all of this craziness
[09:25.300 --> 09:26.460]  during the vote counting.
[09:26.460 --> 09:29.820]  I mean, you know, we don't live quite in the neighborhood,
[09:29.820 --> 09:32.880]  but the Convention Center is, you know, I don't know,
[09:32.880 --> 09:34.340]  it's like a mile away or something.
[09:34.340 --> 09:35.420]  It's very close.
[09:35.420 --> 09:38.420]  It's right around the corner from Hopsing, actually.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.980]  Yeah, I know that area really well.
[09:39.980 --> 09:40.820]  That's where the gallery is.
[09:40.820 --> 09:45.820]  Right, right, which is undergoing a major reconstruction,
[09:46.180 --> 09:48.020]  you know, sort of modernizing.
[09:49.020 --> 09:52.460]  When this was going on, it seemed crazy
[09:52.460 --> 09:53.900]  that it would be at the Four Seasons.
[09:53.900 --> 09:56.220]  The Four Seasons used to be on the Parkway,
[09:56.220 --> 10:00.400]  but then they were now on the penthouse floors
[10:00.400 --> 10:02.340]  of the new Comcast Tower.
[10:02.340 --> 10:04.780]  So like the top two or three floors
[10:04.780 --> 10:08.500]  of the new tallest building in Center City
[10:08.500 --> 10:10.260]  is the Four Seasons.
[10:10.260 --> 10:11.240]  It just seemed crazy.
[10:11.240 --> 10:13.640]  Why in the world, you know, for the few minutes
[10:13.640 --> 10:15.260]  where it seemed like they would be doing this,
[10:15.260 --> 10:16.900]  it seemed like how is this even possible?
[10:16.900 --> 10:19.380]  And at the time, there were restrictions in the city.
[10:19.380 --> 10:22.080]  You couldn't hold a press conference indoors.
[10:22.080 --> 10:24.380]  And then when the total landscaping thing came out,
[10:24.380 --> 10:25.400]  this is my favorite thing.
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.980]  My wife, who I believe you know,
[10:26.980 --> 10:28.700]  you're familiar with my wife.
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.620]  Is it still Amy Jane?
[10:30.620 --> 10:32.540]  My first wife.
[10:32.540 --> 10:34.780]  That surprises me, by the way.
[10:34.780 --> 10:37.900]  Nobody's more surprised than me, quite honestly.
[10:37.900 --> 10:38.740]  Oh, I believe you.
[10:38.740 --> 10:41.140]  Really, it's really, I feel like I'm over, you know.
[10:41.140 --> 10:44.500]  But anyway, my favorite thing was when Trump tweeted
[10:44.500 --> 10:46.620]  Four Seasons total landscaping,
[10:46.620 --> 10:49.100]  Amy was on Twitter at the time,
[10:49.100 --> 10:51.400]  and she said, what does that even mean?
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.420]  And she thought it meant it was some kind of jargon
[10:55.420 --> 11:00.420]  like carpet bagging or gerrymandering, you know,
[11:00.620 --> 11:04.460]  like a landscaping is some kind of old-timey,
[11:04.460 --> 11:07.460]  100-year-old term for a way to get cheated
[11:07.460 --> 11:08.620]  out of an election.
[11:08.620 --> 11:10.900]  And wouldn't it be Trump, like, wouldn't it,
[11:10.900 --> 11:13.100]  if that was a, you know, like a,
[11:13.100 --> 11:14.460]  if it was a landscaping,
[11:14.460 --> 11:17.220]  Trump would call it a total landscaping, right?
[11:17.220 --> 11:18.060]  It's-
[11:18.060 --> 11:18.900]  The best landscaping.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.100]  Right, it was a total landscaping.
[11:21.100 --> 11:23.740]  But it turns out it was actually not.
[11:23.740 --> 11:27.180]  It was actually a landscaping company in the Northeast.
[11:28.500 --> 11:32.440]  So, shit, I can't remember if that was last week
[11:32.440 --> 11:33.280]  or this week.
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.100]  Remember when he went to Alamo, Texas?
[11:37.100 --> 11:39.460]  That was like, what, two days ago?
[11:39.460 --> 11:40.660]  Was that two days ago?
[11:40.660 --> 11:44.460]  Jesus, he totally meant to be going to the Alamo
[11:44.460 --> 11:45.580]  in San Antonio, right?
[11:45.580 --> 11:47.940]  I had to, right?
[11:47.940 --> 11:49.140]  That was the same thing.
[11:49.140 --> 11:54.140]  And it, in fact, his dummies on the internet,
[11:54.300 --> 11:56.020]  they all thought that this is it,
[11:56.020 --> 11:57.780]  because they're, you know, people screenshotted this,
[11:57.780 --> 11:59.900]  you know, like the people who got kicked off Reddit
[11:59.900 --> 12:02.260]  and they, what do they have, thedonald.win
[12:02.260 --> 12:05.580]  or whatever they reformed.
[12:05.580 --> 12:06.940]  They were all celebrating it.
[12:06.940 --> 12:09.100]  They're like this, you know, these kooks who think that,
[12:09.100 --> 12:12.900]  you know, that he somehow is gonna unveil evidence.
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.780]  They're like, ah, genius, his last stand
[12:15.780 --> 12:16.980]  will be at the Alamo.
[12:16.980 --> 12:19.900]  Do it at the Alamo, yeah, like Davey Crockett.
[12:19.900 --> 12:22.140]  He's lucky he didn't have it like the Alamo Rent-A-Car
[12:22.140 --> 12:25.280]  at Reagan International Airport.
[12:26.500 --> 12:28.700]  Jesus Christ, that would have been amazing.
[12:30.260 --> 12:35.260]  I really hope somebody floated the Alamo Rent-A-Car stand
[12:37.020 --> 12:37.860]  as an idea.
[12:40.700 --> 12:42.060]  What a shit-shit.
[12:42.060 --> 12:45.000]  Un, really, just unbelievable.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.660]  What a total absolute shit joke.
[12:48.660 --> 12:49.900]  I wanna talk to you.
[12:49.900 --> 12:52.260]  Well, let me take a break first, I'll do it.
[12:52.260 --> 12:53.140]  She gave me on your pocket?
[12:53.140 --> 12:53.980]  Yeah.

[14:45.580 --> 14:46.780]  You sound extremely.
[14:46.780 --> 14:48.540]  I'm very happy about Hello Fresh.
[14:48.540 --> 14:49.380]  I like them.
[14:50.300 --> 14:52.780]  All right, I wanted to have you on the show
[14:52.780 --> 14:56.020]  because I've been wondering about this with Twitter
[14:56.020 --> 14:59.260]  and kicking Trump off the platform and I.
[14:59.260 --> 15:00.540]  I heard a little something.
[15:00.540 --> 15:04.540]  I have been on the side of they should kick him off
[15:04.540 --> 15:05.580]  for a while now.
[15:05.580 --> 15:08.300]  I thought it should have happened a while ago.
[15:08.300 --> 15:09.860]  And you know.
[15:09.860 --> 15:10.700]  I might agree.
[15:10.700 --> 15:12.220]  Well, here's the thing.
[15:12.220 --> 15:14.180]  I was thinking about who I should have on the show
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.020]  to talk to you about.
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.900]  I don't want someone who's just going to agree with me
[15:16.900 --> 15:18.940]  and I'm thinking I should try to find somebody
[15:18.940 --> 15:22.380]  who thinks that he shouldn't be kicked off.
[15:22.380 --> 15:24.700]  And you can't, I can't find anybody at this point.
[15:24.700 --> 15:27.140]  And then I realized the better debate
[15:27.140 --> 15:32.140]  would be to have you on because you felt more strongly
[15:32.140 --> 15:35.660]  about it than I did and thought, you know.
[15:35.660 --> 15:39.220]  So tell me when you think they should have kicked him
[15:39.220 --> 15:40.420]  off the show.
[15:40.420 --> 15:43.500]  I mean, it's fair to say that you have been a leading critic
[15:43.500 --> 15:46.940]  of Twitter's continuing support for this president
[15:46.940 --> 15:48.180]  being on their platform.
[15:49.420 --> 15:53.260]  I mean, I've been one of the louder ones.
[15:53.260 --> 15:55.660]  I don't know if it's amounted to a hill of beans
[15:56.700 --> 15:59.300]  but I'm certainly not afraid to yell.
[15:59.300 --> 16:04.300]  And I've been, so I've been bugging Twitter about this
[16:09.220 --> 16:13.740]  since, I guess since he entered the race in 2016
[16:15.900 --> 16:18.620]  because I mean, I was, you know,
[16:20.420 --> 16:22.980]  everybody remembers the scene of him coming down,
[16:22.980 --> 16:26.180]  you know, the golden escalator at Trump Tower
[16:26.180 --> 16:29.340]  and immediately declaring that Mexicans were rapists
[16:29.340 --> 16:31.900]  and that he was running for president.
[16:31.900 --> 16:36.660]  At the same time, he was amassing a ton of Twitter followers
[16:36.660 --> 16:41.660]  and do you remember his first tweet?
[16:41.700 --> 16:42.620]  No, I don't.
[16:43.740 --> 16:46.300]  It was something about, hey,
[16:46.300 --> 16:49.820]  I'm gonna be on some late night talk show.
[16:49.820 --> 16:51.900]  I forget which one, but hey,
[16:51.900 --> 16:54.180]  I'm gonna be on some late night talk show,
[16:54.180 --> 16:56.380]  come and, you know, come and watch.
[16:56.380 --> 16:58.220]  That was his first tweet.
[16:58.220 --> 17:02.180]  And for a while, I mean, that was the kind of tweet
[17:02.180 --> 17:03.180]  that he would send.
[17:04.380 --> 17:07.460]  Remember he had that whole thing with Robert Pattinson
[17:07.460 --> 17:11.780]  and about, you know, you shouldn't be dating Chris Stewart.
[17:11.780 --> 17:14.340]  It was that kind of like celebrity bullshit.
[17:15.380 --> 17:18.100]  And then he kind of stumbled into,
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.660]  hey, what if I make a couple of really racist tweets?
[17:20.660 --> 17:24.900]  And his follower count started going up
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.500]  and then it exploded.
[17:26.500 --> 17:31.180]  So like any good sociopath,
[17:31.180 --> 17:34.380]  he started doing the thing that got him the attention.
[17:34.380 --> 17:39.380]  So stuff got more virulent, more racist, more sexist.
[17:41.180 --> 17:42.460]  He started getting more followers.
[17:42.460 --> 17:45.620]  And at the same time, remember at the same time,
[17:45.620 --> 17:48.100]  I mean, this was back when Twitter was talking about
[17:48.100 --> 17:50.900]  like, holy shit, we should probably just sell the Facebook
[17:50.900 --> 17:54.420]  or, you know, we're running out of cash here.
[17:54.420 --> 17:55.740]  We don't know what we're gonna do.
[17:55.740 --> 17:58.580]  And all of a sudden they discover this secret potion
[17:59.860 --> 18:03.300]  of this 70-year-old xenophobe.
[18:05.260 --> 18:08.420]  And they decide we're gonna ride this guy to the bank.
[18:09.340 --> 18:11.500]  Then he decides to run for president.
[18:11.500 --> 18:15.700]  And we were like equal parts mocking him.
[18:15.700 --> 18:18.500]  Like, oh my God, what an idiot.
[18:18.500 --> 18:20.900]  This is gonna be hilarious.
[18:20.900 --> 18:21.940]  Like I remember at this point,
[18:21.940 --> 18:25.220]  Jon Stewart was still doing the Daily Show.
[18:25.220 --> 18:27.100]  And I remember Jon doing a segment
[18:27.100 --> 18:29.940]  with where he was like, thank you, thank you.
[18:29.940 --> 18:31.860]  On behalf of comedians everywhere,
[18:31.860 --> 18:33.860]  thank you for running again
[18:33.860 --> 18:37.900]  because this is exactly what we need to make the jokes.
[18:39.180 --> 18:44.180]  So it was like 50% that and 50% of people who were like,
[18:44.180 --> 18:48.220]  no, wait a minute, this is actually terrifying
[18:49.660 --> 18:54.380]  because this is, this idiot actually knows
[18:54.380 --> 18:57.980]  how to reach like the worst of the worst
[18:57.980 --> 19:01.020]  and speak in their language and fire them up.
[19:01.020 --> 19:04.020]  And he has absolutely no problem
[19:04.020 --> 19:05.900]  saying what they believe to hear.
[19:08.740 --> 19:10.380]  And so he was on Twitter
[19:10.380 --> 19:12.340]  and he was building this massive following
[19:12.340 --> 19:16.220]  and he was saying all of this terribly racist, sexist stuff.
[19:16.220 --> 19:19.460]  And he was attacking people personally
[19:19.460 --> 19:21.820]  and it was getting dangerous.
[19:22.900 --> 19:27.380]  Twitter, rather than following the rules,
[19:27.380 --> 19:31.220]  its own guidelines that were already in print,
[19:31.220 --> 19:34.180]  rather than doing that, they kept moving the goalposts
[19:34.180 --> 19:37.740]  to excuse what he was saying
[19:37.740 --> 19:39.460]  because that was getting them
[19:39.460 --> 19:42.580]  that all-important engagement that they wanted.
[19:42.580 --> 19:47.020]  Right, it was just, it drove,
[19:47.020 --> 19:50.220]  helped cement their place in the.
[19:50.220 --> 19:52.620]  He was making them money, it was making them money.
[19:52.620 --> 19:55.580]  In our collective minds, Trump tweets,
[19:55.580 --> 20:00.420]  it really did drive Twitter as a source of news.
[20:00.420 --> 20:03.420]  Like the fact, what he tweeted was the news.
[20:04.860 --> 20:07.660]  I mean, history is gonna remember,
[20:07.660 --> 20:09.540]  when history talks about Trump,
[20:09.540 --> 20:12.620]  the word tweet will be in the first sentence.
[20:13.620 --> 20:16.220]  I've seen people talking about,
[20:16.220 --> 20:18.300]  well, do you think he ever could have been president
[20:18.300 --> 20:19.260]  without Twitter?
[20:19.260 --> 20:21.300]  I don't even think it's close.
[20:21.300 --> 20:23.980]  I don't even think it's a close call
[20:23.980 --> 20:26.220]  because I don't think he ever would have got propelled
[20:26.220 --> 20:28.500]  into politics without Twitter, right?
[20:28.500 --> 20:30.500]  It's like what you were just saying five minutes ago.
[20:30.500 --> 20:34.460]  He used to be talking about the type of stuff
[20:34.460 --> 20:37.340]  that a game show host would tweet about
[20:37.340 --> 20:38.580]  because that's what he was.
[20:38.580 --> 20:39.940]  Yeah.
[20:39.940 --> 20:43.340]  Yeah, and I'm sure that all of the racist, xenophobic shit
[20:43.340 --> 20:48.340]  that he spews out on Twitter was shit that he said at home.
[20:48.420 --> 20:51.420]  I'm not saying Twitter made him that way.
[20:51.420 --> 20:54.620]  I'm saying that Twitter gave him one hell of a bullhorn.
[20:54.620 --> 20:57.500]  He really got propelled into politics
[20:57.500 --> 21:02.340]  on the issue of whether Barack Obama was born in Kenya
[21:02.340 --> 21:06.380]  and was therefore unfit to be the president
[21:06.380 --> 21:07.580]  under the Constitution.
[21:08.580 --> 21:13.580]  That was his first big flip from standard
[21:15.020 --> 21:17.740]  used car salesman bullshit into politics
[21:17.740 --> 21:19.420]  was the birtherism angle.
[21:20.700 --> 21:23.780]  And he got a tremendous amount of attention for that.
[21:23.780 --> 21:25.740]  And it's really hard to imagine how he did it,
[21:25.740 --> 21:27.300]  how he would have done it without Twitter.
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.180]  I mean, I guess he could have and he did
[21:29.180 --> 21:32.380]  call into Fox News shows and be on the telephone
[21:32.380 --> 21:35.540]  talking to whoever was the, Bill O'Reilly
[21:35.540 --> 21:36.980]  or whoever was the host
[21:36.980 --> 21:38.900]  before he got kicked off the network.
[21:40.660 --> 21:44.340]  But it really was, why was Donald Trump
[21:44.340 --> 21:48.420]  considered an authority on the issue of the quote unquote
[21:48.420 --> 21:50.900]  controversy over birtherism?
[21:50.900 --> 21:52.740]  It's because of his tweets, right?
[21:54.100 --> 21:57.340]  Donald Trump would not have been president without Twitter.
[21:58.820 --> 22:01.900]  And Twitter had everything they needed
[22:01.900 --> 22:05.220]  to stop Donald Trump from becoming president
[22:05.220 --> 22:09.780]  back in 2016 by just enforcing their own rules.
[22:11.300 --> 22:14.540]  I think about, and it is,
[22:14.540 --> 22:16.700]  what he did tweet was against the rules.
[22:16.700 --> 22:20.700]  I don't see, and I do think that's important,
[22:20.700 --> 22:23.500]  and carving out this exception that,
[22:23.500 --> 22:27.300]  okay, everybody else has to follow these rules,
[22:27.300 --> 22:31.540]  but we will make an exception for state leaders
[22:31.540 --> 22:34.420]  is almost the worst thing you could do.
[22:34.420 --> 22:36.700]  If there's anybody, if there's one group
[22:36.700 --> 22:38.220]  that should have to follow the rules,
[22:38.220 --> 22:39.900]  it should be state leaders.
[22:40.940 --> 22:42.460]  And if there's one group that certainly
[22:42.460 --> 22:46.540]  doesn't need to be amplified, it's state leaders.
[22:46.540 --> 22:49.660]  I mean, when you listen to some of the arguments
[22:49.660 --> 22:52.500]  that people have made about why he needs to be there,
[22:52.500 --> 22:56.020]  it's like, well, because we need to know what he thinks.
[22:56.020 --> 22:58.500]  We've known what every president has thought
[22:59.660 --> 23:00.700]  without Twitter.
[23:00.700 --> 23:04.820]  They literally have the world's,
[23:04.820 --> 23:08.140]  they literally have a press room in their house.
[23:08.140 --> 23:10.020]  That's true, right?
[23:10.020 --> 23:10.860]  In their house.
[23:10.860 --> 23:12.820]  Right, we've never, you don't look back
[23:12.820 --> 23:15.300]  at the previous 44 presidents and say
[23:15.300 --> 23:17.980]  that they were silenced because they didn't have Twitter
[23:17.980 --> 23:22.980]  or didn't use it or, nope, it's just not true.
[23:23.580 --> 23:27.820]  To me, and it's very clear now that he's gone.
[23:27.820 --> 23:32.820]  And I mean, my argument on maybe it was okay,
[23:34.140 --> 23:36.100]  I'll try to take Twitter's side on this
[23:36.100 --> 23:38.620]  and say that they, I think they're,
[23:38.620 --> 23:40.980]  what was the saying from the Revolutionary War
[23:40.980 --> 23:42.700]  where there was a battle and the guy said,
[23:42.700 --> 23:46.300]  don't fire till you can see the whites of their eyes, right?
[23:46.300 --> 23:48.500]  Everybody grows up hearing this legend.
[23:48.500 --> 23:52.860]  And I think that's sort of the mindset Twitter had
[23:52.860 --> 23:57.860]  of he did things that could be justified
[23:58.460 --> 24:01.180]  for kicking him off before,
[24:01.180 --> 24:03.300]  but wait until it's even worse,
[24:03.300 --> 24:04.380]  wait until it's even worse,
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.500]  wait until it's even worse,
[24:05.500 --> 24:07.140]  and then all of a sudden he's telling
[24:07.140 --> 24:10.540]  these armed insurrectionists to go storm the Capitol
[24:10.540 --> 24:13.460]  and they do it and people get killed.
[24:13.460 --> 24:17.660]  A cop got his brains bashed in with a fire extinguisher.
[24:17.660 --> 24:21.300]  I mean, and it was perilously close to them
[24:21.300 --> 24:24.700]  bursting in and getting access to members of Congress.
[24:26.060 --> 24:28.860]  And so clearly this is over the line.
[24:28.860 --> 24:30.220]  And to me, there might be,
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.100]  if to play devil's advocate to you,
[24:32.100 --> 24:36.020]  there's some sense in my mind,
[24:36.020 --> 24:39.340]  a feeling that okay, now it's this,
[24:39.340 --> 24:41.900]  you cannot take the other side.
[24:41.900 --> 24:45.020]  If you do, you're supporting an armed insurrection.
[24:47.380 --> 24:48.220]  So yeah.
[24:48.220 --> 24:49.460]  And I mean, they're still doing it.
[24:49.460 --> 24:53.660]  We still had like, what, almost 200 Congress people
[24:53.660 --> 24:55.700]  yesterday vote to not impeach him?
[24:55.700 --> 24:57.620]  For trying to get them killed.
[24:58.700 --> 25:00.260]  Yeah.
[25:00.260 --> 25:04.660]  You know, the wait till they see the whites
[25:04.660 --> 25:06.700]  or their eyes things reminds me of,
[25:07.820 --> 25:09.540]  so my whole family voted for him.
[25:11.740 --> 25:16.740]  And when I was trying to talk sense into him back in 2016,
[25:16.740 --> 25:19.580]  I was like, because we're immigrants,
[25:19.580 --> 25:21.700]  we're an immigrant family.
[25:21.700 --> 25:25.620]  And I was like, how the hell can you vote for this clown?
[25:25.620 --> 25:28.940]  I mean, he's a xenophobia, he hates, not us,
[25:28.940 --> 25:31.420]  not us was the first thing that they told me.
[25:32.340 --> 25:34.140]  He didn't mean us.
[25:34.140 --> 25:36.700]  He means those other, the black and brown ones
[25:36.700 --> 25:40.580]  and not European immigrants.
[25:40.580 --> 25:45.500]  And I mean, when we talk about like,
[25:47.020 --> 25:51.180]  Twitter, you know, waiting to see how much worse
[25:51.180 --> 25:55.060]  it could get and waiting to collect a body of evidence.
[25:55.060 --> 25:57.500]  Decisions like this are generally made by people
[25:57.500 --> 26:01.820]  who are on that last line of protection,
[26:02.660 --> 26:06.060]  otherwise known as privilege of being hurt.
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.820]  So let's let them make fun of these people.
[26:09.820 --> 26:11.540]  Let's let them make fun of these people.
[26:11.540 --> 26:13.420]  Let's let them make fun of these people.
[26:13.420 --> 26:15.780]  Okay, now he's getting a little too close to us.
[26:18.220 --> 26:19.620]  Okay, we've seen them take down,
[26:19.620 --> 26:21.580]  we've seen them take down like eight groups.
[26:21.580 --> 26:22.860]  Now he's getting a little close.
[26:22.860 --> 26:24.940]  All right, now it's dangerous.
[26:24.940 --> 26:27.260]  And that's one of the things that pisses me off
[26:27.260 --> 26:30.380]  about that sort of thinking is like,
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.060]  we'll let them go ahead and use other people at,
[26:34.060 --> 26:36.220]  well, let's test, let's test on them.
[26:36.220 --> 26:41.220]  And then if he gets close to us, then we'll do something.
[26:42.940 --> 26:46.100]  And there's another analogy that I've been thinking about
[26:46.100 --> 26:49.380]  is if you spot a kid playing with matches,
[26:49.380 --> 26:52.820]  you take the matches away right away.
[26:52.820 --> 26:55.660]  You don't wait until they actually start a fire, right?
[26:55.660 --> 27:00.660]  Like, and I don't, I know that there's news coming out
[27:01.260 --> 27:03.420]  even as we speak a week later.
[27:03.420 --> 27:04.820]  There's still news coming out
[27:04.820 --> 27:08.220]  about what exactly went on and which groups
[27:08.220 --> 27:10.300]  were actually not just a bunch of yahoos
[27:10.300 --> 27:11.460]  walking around the halls,
[27:11.460 --> 27:15.060]  but actually had a plot last week.
[27:15.060 --> 27:17.340]  It's worse than it looked.
[27:17.340 --> 27:21.340]  And I really feel that by the time we're done reporting,
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.540]  reading the reports on this,
[27:22.540 --> 27:24.820]  we're gonna see how perilously close we were
[27:24.820 --> 27:27.660]  to a truly profound disaster.
[27:27.660 --> 27:30.340]  Like, I still don't know that it makes,
[27:30.340 --> 27:31.940]  there was a path to make him president,
[27:31.940 --> 27:35.180]  but there was definitely a path where members of Congress
[27:35.180 --> 27:37.500]  get killed on that day.
[27:37.500 --> 27:40.860]  Yeah, no, I mean, I think we're eventually gonna see
[27:40.860 --> 27:44.340]  like those line drawing diagrams,
[27:44.340 --> 27:47.420]  like bird's eye view of like, here's a Congress person
[27:47.420 --> 27:51.580]  and here's like the six inches of drywall separating them
[27:51.580 --> 27:56.580]  from this jackass carrying like five weapons.
[27:56.580 --> 28:01.580]  There's an argument that Jack Dorsey has too much,
[28:01.900 --> 28:04.780]  Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg have too much power
[28:04.780 --> 28:07.540]  because they do run their companies
[28:07.540 --> 28:10.440]  and ultimately it's their call, right?
[28:10.440 --> 28:12.540]  It's Zuckerberg who signed his name to the post
[28:12.540 --> 28:15.340]  that said he's permanently banned from Facebook.
[28:15.340 --> 28:18.020]  And you know, obviously Jack was the one
[28:18.020 --> 28:19.780]  that you've been petitioning.
[28:19.780 --> 28:22.620]  I mean, and you've talked to Jack, right?
[28:22.620 --> 28:23.820]  I mean.
[28:23.820 --> 28:28.820]  I did, I talked to him face to face in January of 2017.
[28:30.460 --> 28:35.460]  We met in person after I'd been giving him,
[28:35.940 --> 28:38.020]  well, I was harassing him.
[28:38.020 --> 28:41.140]  I was harassing him on Twitter about this
[28:41.140 --> 28:46.140]  and he agreed to meet and we met and we talked about this
[28:47.540 --> 28:50.700]  and I walked out of there terrified.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.540]  Why?
[28:51.540 --> 28:55.700]  Because I saw fear.
[28:56.580 --> 29:01.140]  I saw somebody who was so incredibly terrified
[29:01.140 --> 29:06.140]  of this situation that he had somehow gotten himself in.
[29:06.460 --> 29:11.460]  It's like he accidentally got himself
[29:13.460 --> 29:18.100]  in this incredibly powerful position.
[29:18.100 --> 29:21.660]  I mean, hold on a second, hold on.
[29:21.660 --> 29:25.340]  Chelsea's leaving for work and I wanna hug her, goodbye.
[29:26.220 --> 29:27.060]  You edit, right?
[29:27.060 --> 29:29.060]  Yeah, yeah, we do, yeah.
[29:29.060 --> 29:29.900]  Sorry, hold on.
[29:33.900 --> 29:35.780]  Have a good day, all right?
[29:35.780 --> 29:36.980]  I'll see you after work.
[29:40.360 --> 29:41.660]  Sorry about that.
[29:41.660 --> 29:44.660]  Let me see if I can start this off.
[29:44.660 --> 29:49.660]  Okay, so he had gotten himself into almost accidentally,
[29:52.220 --> 29:56.420]  he wanted to do a messaging app for bike messengers.
[29:56.420 --> 29:57.260]  Remember that?
[29:57.260 --> 29:58.660]  Yeah, totally, yeah.
[29:58.660 --> 30:01.900]  And here he is now accidentally,
[30:01.900 --> 30:03.820]  he forest-gumped himself
[30:04.840 --> 30:07.620]  into this position of incredible power.
[30:07.620 --> 30:10.100]  He had absolutely no idea how to handle it
[30:10.100 --> 30:11.900]  or what to do with it.
[30:11.900 --> 30:15.960]  He doesn't have the strongest moral code in the world.
[30:16.980 --> 30:21.980]  And everybody was telling him how awesome he was.
[30:22.700 --> 30:26.980]  And he had apparently done away with anybody
[30:26.980 --> 30:31.580]  who was a good enough friend or whatever
[30:32.620 --> 30:36.020]  to smack him upside the head when he needed a good smacking,
[30:36.020 --> 30:37.580]  which everyone needs.
[30:37.580 --> 30:42.580]  And he somehow found himself in charge
[30:43.140 --> 30:47.660]  of the platform that the most powerful person
[30:47.660 --> 30:51.420]  in the world was using to communicate,
[30:51.420 --> 30:53.700]  and he didn't know how to control him.
[30:53.700 --> 30:55.620]  And he was terrified.
[30:55.620 --> 30:59.460]  The time to do it was at the beginning,
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.740]  like when he was a game show host
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.700]  posting racist conspiracy theories
[31:04.700 --> 31:07.000]  about Obama's birthplace.
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.380]  That was the time to do it.
[31:08.380 --> 31:09.220]  Yeah, he could have stopped it right there.
[31:09.220 --> 31:10.720]  And you just say this?
[31:10.720 --> 31:15.120]  Imagine where we would be right now, seriously,
[31:15.120 --> 31:18.460]  imagine what me and you would be doing right now
[31:19.420 --> 31:23.620]  if Jack Dorsey had done his job back in 2016.
[31:26.980 --> 31:30.240]  If he had enforced his own guidelines,
[31:30.240 --> 31:35.240]  his own agreed-to guidelines on this guy in 2016,
[31:35.240 --> 31:39.280]  imagine where me and you would be right now.
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.820]  Imagine what you'd be doing.
[31:40.820 --> 31:43.000]  Imagine what your kid would be doing.
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.480]  And I mean, this goes for every listener out there.
[31:46.480 --> 31:51.480]  Imagine what your life has been the last four years,
[31:51.520 --> 31:55.000]  the fear and the anxiety and the terror,
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.540]  and finally, like this, an unchecked pandemic.
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.420]  So much worse response to the pandemic
[32:02.420 --> 32:05.760]  of any other country in the world that it is ridiculous.
[32:05.760 --> 32:06.880]  It's absurd.
[32:06.880 --> 32:09.240]  I mean, my dad's sister died of COVID.
[32:09.240 --> 32:11.880]  My aunt died of COVID.
[32:11.880 --> 32:15.400]  I mean, I'm not looking for, it's terrible.
[32:15.400 --> 32:20.400]  But I mean, to say that it is real to me, it's profound.
[32:23.720 --> 32:27.720]  We're arguing whether it's real, which is ridiculous.
[32:27.720 --> 32:32.720]  That to me is the, that's the unacceptable aspect of it.
[32:32.720 --> 32:37.720]  The using it, to put it in a political terms, the big lie.
[32:38.020 --> 32:42.040]  So it's a big lie that this election was rigged in any way.
[32:42.040 --> 32:46.040]  This was actually arguably one of the most secure elections
[32:46.040 --> 32:51.040]  in the history of human democracy, the opposite.
[32:51.400 --> 32:53.240]  It couldn't be more untrue.
[32:53.240 --> 32:54.640]  It's a big lie.
[32:54.640 --> 32:59.640]  And that to me is the effectiveness.
[33:00.440 --> 33:03.880]  Because on the one hand, we're talking about the fact
[33:03.880 --> 33:05.480]  that the president of the United States,
[33:05.480 --> 33:08.280]  this president, the next president, previous presidents,
[33:08.280 --> 33:11.880]  don't need Twitter to get their message out, right?
[33:11.880 --> 33:16.420]  But so to me, this whole argument about free speech
[33:16.420 --> 33:20.000]  and that he's being quote unquote silenced is,
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.680]  it's sophistry.
[33:21.680 --> 33:26.500]  They're arguing about free speech and silencing people
[33:26.500 --> 33:28.680]  because they know that people,
[33:28.680 --> 33:31.260]  there's widespread support for free speech
[33:31.260 --> 33:36.260]  and tolerating viewpoints that we disagree with, right?
[33:37.680 --> 33:39.880]  I mean, at some point, at some point,
[33:39.880 --> 33:43.720]  when we're done counting the bodies
[33:43.720 --> 33:45.240]  and doing that important work
[33:45.240 --> 33:47.160]  and getting this pandemic under control,
[33:47.160 --> 33:52.160]  we're gonna start doing like our top 500 things ruined
[33:54.680 --> 33:57.160]  by this administration list.
[33:57.160 --> 33:58.760]  There were a lot of them.
[33:58.760 --> 34:02.680]  What it's done to the issue of free speech
[34:02.680 --> 34:04.320]  is in the top 10 for me.
[34:05.280 --> 34:07.460]  I'm a free speech advocate.
[34:07.460 --> 34:09.680]  Right, and me too, I really am.
[34:09.680 --> 34:10.760]  And so-
[34:10.760 --> 34:12.000]  I would think it were.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  And the cynical way that it's being talked about now
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.840]  by both the jackasses on the right
[34:20.840 --> 34:23.560]  and the jackasses in tech companies
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.560]  and the way what they have turned free speech into,
[34:29.600 --> 34:32.520]  the mutation, the horrid mutation,
[34:32.520 --> 34:34.480]  that's their definition of free speech
[34:34.480 --> 34:39.480]  is so counter to what it was actually intended to be
[34:39.480 --> 34:43.080]  and what it actually still is legally
[34:44.440 --> 34:49.440]  that it's really fucked with the whole idea
[34:49.880 --> 34:51.560]  of what free speech is about.
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.320]  So basically, free speech means the government can't tell you
[34:57.320 --> 34:59.120]  you can't put this podcast up, John.
[34:59.120 --> 34:59.960]  We don't like what you say.
[34:59.960 --> 35:01.160]  It's the government doing it.
[35:01.160 --> 35:03.740]  I mean, it's such an important distinction.
[35:03.740 --> 35:07.560]  I mean, the first line of the First Amendment
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.560]  is Congress shall pass none, something like that.
[35:14.600 --> 35:16.920]  But it applies to Congress.
[35:20.040 --> 35:21.400]  But this is your podcast
[35:21.400 --> 35:23.040]  and you can have on whoever you want.
[35:23.040 --> 35:25.560]  You can talk about whatever you want
[35:25.560 --> 35:29.360]  and people can decide whether to listen to it
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.400]  or not listen to it.
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.180]  If you go off on some weird right-wing tangent,
[35:35.180 --> 35:37.160]  somebody can decide, well, you know what?
[35:37.160 --> 35:38.280]  I don't want to listen to that.
[35:38.280 --> 35:39.300]  I don't want to be on that.
[35:39.300 --> 35:41.200]  I don't want to host that.
[35:41.200 --> 35:43.340]  I don't want to be associated with that.
[35:43.340 --> 35:44.680]  None of those things,
[35:44.680 --> 35:47.380]  none of those things are about free speech.
[35:47.380 --> 35:48.220]  Right.
[35:49.800 --> 35:53.760]  In fact, I would argue that me telling you
[35:53.760 --> 35:57.120]  I won't host your hateful podcast anymore
[35:57.120 --> 35:59.280]  is more covered by free speech
[36:00.180 --> 36:01.360]  than you being able to host.
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.360]  Right, because there's agency involved in sovereignty.
[36:07.760 --> 36:10.160]  You get to say what you want to say,
[36:10.160 --> 36:12.640]  but the restaurant owner also gets to say,
[36:12.640 --> 36:15.240]  if you're gonna say that in my restaurant, you're out.
[36:16.280 --> 36:17.120]  Right.
[36:19.960 --> 36:22.820]  Your ability to use racial slurs
[36:22.820 --> 36:25.760]  to address the waitstaff at a restaurant,
[36:28.200 --> 36:29.440]  it is your right.
[36:29.440 --> 36:32.200]  You're not going to be arrested for it,
[36:32.200 --> 36:33.880]  but the restaurant has a right,
[36:33.880 --> 36:35.960]  and if they want to be the sort of restaurant
[36:35.960 --> 36:37.720]  people want to go to,
[36:37.720 --> 36:41.680]  they're going to tell you you're not welcome there anymore.
[36:41.680 --> 36:43.160]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I would,
[36:43.160 --> 36:45.720]  I would say that they have an obligation to do that.
[36:45.720 --> 36:48.800]  There was a friend sent me a story.
[36:48.800 --> 36:50.620]  It seems like one of those things that's gone around,
[36:50.620 --> 36:51.800]  but I had never seen it before,
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.440]  but it was just a story about a guy sitting in a bar,
[36:56.440 --> 36:59.840]  and a guy sits next to him, and a stranger comes up
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.920]  to the bar, and he has Nazi patches on his jacket,
[37:03.920 --> 37:07.560]  and the bartender just immediately says, out, get out,
[37:07.560 --> 37:10.320]  get the hell out, and the guy said, what, what?
[37:10.320 --> 37:14.040]  And he said, just get out, you're out.
[37:14.040 --> 37:15.440]  The guy hadn't even opened his mouth,
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.480]  hadn't said anything, he was by himself.
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.320]  The guy who's still at the bar says, what was that about?
[37:20.320 --> 37:21.720]  And he's like, you saw his patches,
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.640]  and he says, yeah, but he didn't say anything.
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.720]  And he said, you let a Nazi in,
[37:30.720 --> 37:33.680]  and next thing you know, you're running a Nazi bar,
[37:33.680 --> 37:36.440]  because what happens is the next time he comes back,
[37:36.440 --> 37:39.240]  he's a nice guy, he doesn't make any trouble.
[37:39.240 --> 37:40.680]  He comes back with a friend,
[37:40.680 --> 37:42.700]  and they don't make any trouble.
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.340]  Then he'd come back with two friends,
[37:44.340 --> 37:45.940]  and maybe the third or fourth guy
[37:45.940 --> 37:47.560]  does start making a little trouble,
[37:47.560 --> 37:49.760]  and does start saying things, and next thing you know,
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.680]  the whole place is covered with Nazis.
[37:52.680 --> 37:54.320]  You gotta get them out.
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.320]  And that, to me, is the power of Twitter
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.160]  removing him from the platform.
[38:04.160 --> 38:05.840]  And it's not about silencing him,
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.040]  it's about saying and reflecting,
[38:09.040 --> 38:10.920]  not just Jadak Dorsey's opinion
[38:10.920 --> 38:14.320]  that he isn't suited to be on the platform,
[38:14.320 --> 38:16.480]  but society's perspective,
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.800]  that you cannot, from a position of power,
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.120]  convince people of serious lies that it's not acceptable.
[38:27.020 --> 38:28.800]  You know, by not booting him,
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.940]  what Jack was telling everybody who Trump was harassing,
[38:33.940 --> 38:36.040]  that he didn't give a shit about them.
[38:36.040 --> 38:37.720]  Right, no, very true.
[38:37.720 --> 38:40.480]  And it's implicitly saying
[38:40.480 --> 38:43.600]  that everything he was doing is acceptable.
[38:43.600 --> 38:44.920]  Not that he agreed,
[38:44.920 --> 38:47.680]  nobody's gonna say that Jack Dorsey agrees
[38:47.680 --> 38:49.180]  with those viewpoints,
[38:49.180 --> 38:51.840]  but that they are acceptable discourse.
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.180]  Yeah, I mean, if I own a bar,
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.400]  I gotta make sure that everybody there is having a nice time.
[39:03.720 --> 39:05.120]  That's my job, I invited them in,
[39:05.120 --> 39:06.680]  I opened the door, I said, hey, come on in,
[39:06.680 --> 39:09.520]  I'll sell you drinks, and in exchange you hang out,
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.800]  and you give me money for those drinks,
[39:11.800 --> 39:14.080]  and I'll create this nice environment
[39:14.080 --> 39:15.540]  for you to come and drink in.
[39:15.540 --> 39:19.000]  And you know, I gotta look out for those folks.
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.880]  So when the Nazi walks in, I mean, you kick him out
[39:24.880 --> 39:27.040]  because you don't want him to come back with his friends,
[39:27.040 --> 39:28.740]  obviously, but you also kick him out
[39:28.740 --> 39:31.920]  because there are other people in the bar.
[39:31.920 --> 39:32.760]  Right.
[39:32.760 --> 39:34.040]  And they're having a good time.
[39:34.040 --> 39:37.000]  And they certainly have a right not to feel threatened,
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.020]  you know, or offended, you know?
[39:39.020 --> 39:44.020]  And you know, if the Nazi should turn to a black patron
[39:44.540 --> 39:48.940]  at the bar and start spouting out racial shit,
[39:48.940 --> 39:51.740]  what am I, I mean, right now,
[39:51.740 --> 39:53.620]  let's say Jack is your bartender,
[39:53.620 --> 39:56.400]  Jack has been telling those patrons,
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.100]  well, he has a right to say that.
[40:00.020 --> 40:02.940]  There's an un, you don't, nobody goes back to that bar,
[40:02.940 --> 40:04.180]  you don't go back to that bar.
[40:04.180 --> 40:07.420]  No, right, and that's how it becomes a Nazi bar,
[40:07.420 --> 40:08.860]  because no one else will go.
[40:10.180 --> 40:15.180]  So Nikki Haley, who was UN ambassador under Trump
[40:15.700 --> 40:16.820]  and one of the few people,
[40:16.820 --> 40:18.980]  she's the former governor of South Carolina,
[40:18.980 --> 40:21.980]  one of the few people involved in this whole administration
[40:21.980 --> 40:24.060]  has her reputation intact.
[40:24.060 --> 40:27.780]  She tweeted, my opinion of her is certainly lower,
[40:27.780 --> 40:32.300]  but you know, her opinion in the world of US politics,
[40:32.300 --> 40:37.300]  you know, she tweeted after Twitter gave him
[40:37.300 --> 40:38.740]  the boot, the permanent boot.
[40:40.260 --> 40:42.340]  Here's the tweet, silencing people,
[40:42.340 --> 40:44.860]  not to mention the president of the US
[40:44.860 --> 40:47.620]  is what happens in China, not our country,
[40:47.620 --> 40:50.300]  hashtag unbelievable.
[40:50.300 --> 40:53.220]  And I talked about this on my other show
[40:53.220 --> 40:54.980]  with Dithering with Ben Thompson,
[40:54.980 --> 40:59.980]  but this infuriates me, this one tweet encapsulates,
[41:01.580 --> 41:05.140]  it's infuriating, but I salute her
[41:05.140 --> 41:10.140]  for so succinctly espousing this viewpoint of silence.
[41:10.740 --> 41:15.540]  And somebody named Jamil Jaffer tweeted a perfect response.
[41:15.540 --> 41:18.780]  Another way to look at this is that forcing publishers
[41:18.780 --> 41:22.020]  to publish the government speech is what happens in China.
[41:22.020 --> 41:25.540]  Right, and that comes to the issue of agency,
[41:25.540 --> 41:28.780]  that Jack Dorsey should not feel obligated
[41:28.780 --> 41:33.780]  to host Trump spouting, you know, that's the opposite of it.
[41:33.780 --> 41:38.780]  But this, when I see these people say silencing,
[41:40.420 --> 41:45.380]  if you replace it with shaming and disgracing, it works.
[41:45.380 --> 41:48.120]  What they're saying is we don't wanna be silenced,
[41:48.120 --> 41:51.980]  what they really mean is we don't want these viewpoints
[41:51.980 --> 41:55.980]  that we have to be shameful and disgraceful.
[41:55.980 --> 41:59.860]  We don't want this to be considered shameful discourse.
[41:59.860 --> 42:02.740]  We want this to be considered acceptable.
[42:02.740 --> 42:06.180]  Right, their argument isn't about free speech,
[42:06.180 --> 42:07.760]  it's about consequences.
[42:09.220 --> 42:11.500]  Like you're saying, they don't wanna have
[42:11.500 --> 42:14.060]  to bear the consequences of what they say.
[42:15.380 --> 42:16.480]  I'm so angry, Mike.
[42:17.620 --> 42:22.260]  And you know, we lose because we take the bait.
[42:22.260 --> 42:25.820]  For four years, we have been taking the bait.
[42:25.820 --> 42:28.860]  Trump says, hey, the Venezuelans stole our election.
[42:29.720 --> 42:32.500]  Which is like, what the fuck, where did that come from?
[42:32.500 --> 42:34.020]  That's almost inspired.
[42:34.940 --> 42:37.140]  It's almost inspired that you could come up
[42:37.140 --> 42:38.980]  with something that inane.
[42:38.980 --> 42:40.180]  Hugo Shep.
[42:40.180 --> 42:41.100]  But all of a sudden.
[42:41.100 --> 42:43.440]  Hugo Chavez, who died 10 years ago.
[42:45.440 --> 42:47.620]  Well, did he?
[42:47.620 --> 42:49.900]  I don't know, how can we be sure?
[42:49.900 --> 42:52.660]  All of a sudden, every newsroom in America
[42:53.940 --> 42:58.940]  is devoting like 30, 40, 50 news reporting hours
[42:58.940 --> 43:01.420]  to seeing whether this is true or not.
[43:03.100 --> 43:03.940]  Right.
[43:05.340 --> 43:09.820]  I mean, his evil, evil, evil genius
[43:11.300 --> 43:15.740]  is that he realized people will chase every inanity
[43:15.740 --> 43:17.260]  that comes out of his mouth.
[43:19.660 --> 43:21.860]  And we're idiots because, you know, look at us,
[43:21.860 --> 43:23.660]  we're still arguing about free speech.
[43:25.260 --> 43:27.420]  And this issue of free speech,
[43:27.420 --> 43:32.420]  and this issue has absolutely zero to do with free speech.
[43:35.420 --> 43:39.480]  But yet, that's what we're arguing about here.
[43:40.480 --> 43:41.800]  So we already took the bait.
[43:41.800 --> 43:42.640]  We already lost.
[43:42.640 --> 43:45.000]  In terms of the power that they say,
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.500]  this unchecked power that Zuckerberg and Dorsey have
[43:48.500 --> 43:50.960]  over their platforms and that it's too concentrated
[43:50.960 --> 43:52.780]  in the hands of a few,
[43:52.780 --> 43:55.340]  it is true that they have enormous power.
[43:55.340 --> 43:56.860]  I mean, there's no question about it.
[43:56.860 --> 44:01.860]  But whether it's unheralded or unprecedented,
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.300]  I would disagree.
[44:06.300 --> 44:09.140]  I would say that the era when I grew up,
[44:09.140 --> 44:10.580]  when you and I were kids,
[44:10.580 --> 44:13.540]  when there were only three broadcast networks on television
[44:13.540 --> 44:15.340]  and every single adult,
[44:15.340 --> 44:17.260]  almost every single adult in the nation
[44:17.260 --> 44:20.380]  is addicted to television to some degree,
[44:20.380 --> 44:22.020]  when there's only three networks,
[44:22.020 --> 44:26.260]  that they had at least as much collective power on the,
[44:26.260 --> 44:28.820]  but they wouldn't use it.
[44:28.820 --> 44:31.340]  A crackpot racist, the John Birch Society,
[44:31.340 --> 44:34.460]  didn't get on ABC's Sunday morning shows
[44:34.460 --> 44:37.600]  and start spouting their lunacy.
[44:37.600 --> 44:38.760]  They kept it off.
[44:40.260 --> 44:41.660]  Yeah, I mean, I would certainly argue
[44:41.660 --> 44:45.040]  that somebody like Walter Cronkite had a ton of power,
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.740]  but he also had a morgue code.
[44:47.740 --> 44:50.580]  It definitely had a tremendous amount of power.
[44:51.740 --> 44:52.820]  I mean, it was no joke.
[44:52.820 --> 44:54.620]  I mean, he was like the most,
[44:54.620 --> 44:57.080]  the Gallup poll would show that he was the most respected
[44:57.080 --> 45:00.900]  person in America after he retired for years.
[45:04.340 --> 45:08.740]  It is dangerous to have power in the hands,
[45:08.740 --> 45:10.980]  tremendous power in the hands of private citizens,
[45:10.980 --> 45:13.620]  but that's the way the system works.
[45:13.620 --> 45:17.260]  I mean, and I don't know what regulation,
[45:17.260 --> 45:19.480]  a government regulation of Facebook and Twitter
[45:19.480 --> 45:21.300]  and social networks should be.
[45:21.300 --> 45:24.020]  It's hard to say.
[45:24.020 --> 45:29.020]  I mean, I would argue that two white dudes on a podcast
[45:30.860 --> 45:33.380]  should not be the ones deciding that.
[45:33.380 --> 45:35.280]  Well, luckily, we won't be.
[45:37.900 --> 45:39.420]  Because I don't know what they are either,
[45:39.420 --> 45:42.680]  but I know that we need something.
[45:42.680 --> 45:46.580]  To me, the powerful thing that is happening at this moment
[45:46.580 --> 45:49.020]  as we speak this week is,
[45:49.020 --> 45:51.720]  and a tremendous shifting in public opinion.
[45:51.720 --> 45:54.140]  I mean, Trump has done so much,
[45:54.140 --> 45:56.100]  what are you doing, popping pills over there?
[45:57.060 --> 45:58.500]  Yeah, Trump.
[45:58.500 --> 45:59.660]  Yeah, like candy.
[45:59.660 --> 46:01.660]  It became a running gag.
[46:01.660 --> 46:06.660]  I mean, John Oliver made We Got Him into a meme.
[46:07.220 --> 46:09.520]  He would do something or say something
[46:09.520 --> 46:12.660]  that was so scandalous and outrageous
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.220]  to right-thinking people,
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.380]  and we would say we got him, right?
[46:17.380 --> 46:20.380]  I mean, most famously, the Access Hollywood tape
[46:20.380 --> 46:22.180]  leaking before the election, right?
[46:22.180 --> 46:26.780]  It seemed like, how can he possibly still get elected
[46:26.780 --> 46:30.500]  when he's caught on tape saying such ridiculous things?
[46:30.500 --> 46:35.380]  Truly profoundly just horrible, offensive.
[46:35.380 --> 46:37.780]  And we got him, we got him.
[46:37.780 --> 46:39.140]  But this time, we did.
[46:39.140 --> 46:40.540]  This time, we did get him.
[46:40.540 --> 46:44.580]  Because all of these times, and he'd do all these things,
[46:44.580 --> 46:48.740]  and his support remained almost unchanged.
[46:48.740 --> 46:52.300]  I mean, we've had a year-long pandemic
[46:52.300 --> 46:56.380]  that he told us repeatedly on camera.
[46:56.380 --> 46:58.500]  I mean, that's the thing, he does all these things on camera
[46:58.500 --> 47:01.180]  told us it was no worse than the flu.
[47:01.180 --> 47:04.900]  It was gonna wash away in April when the days get longer
[47:04.900 --> 47:07.540]  and it gets a little nicer weather
[47:07.540 --> 47:09.980]  in the northern hemisphere, it'll just go away.
[47:09.980 --> 47:11.860]  I mean, it's just ridiculous things.
[47:11.860 --> 47:15.980]  And his support did not go down until this week.
[47:15.980 --> 47:18.460]  Now his support has truly taken,
[47:18.460 --> 47:20.220]  it's like an 11 or 12-point dive.
[47:21.900 --> 47:23.500]  Well, his support didn't change.
[47:23.500 --> 47:26.860]  And the other things that didn't change
[47:26.860 --> 47:29.980]  was he remained white and he remained a racist.
[47:31.580 --> 47:34.580]  And that's what people were voting for.
[47:35.540 --> 47:38.340]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[47:38.340 --> 47:41.140]  Oh, man, am I happy to talk about this.
[47:41.140 --> 47:44.020]  Tech Memes Ride Home Podcast.
[47:44.020 --> 47:46.940]  Hey, when The New Yorker magazine asked Mark Zuckerberg,
[47:46.940 --> 47:48.940]  of all people, how he gets his news,
[47:48.940 --> 47:52.100]  he said the one news source he definitely follows
[47:52.100 --> 47:53.380]  is Tech Meme.
[47:53.380 --> 47:55.460]  I have been reading Tech Meme personally
[47:55.460 --> 47:58.980]  for, God, close to 20 years at this point.

[48:52.320 --> 48:54.180]  around the latest news of the day.

[48:58.360 --> 49:01.140]  as well as behind the scenes analysis.
[49:01.140 --> 49:04.040]  The Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast is like too long,
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.300]  didn't read, as a service.

[49:52.440 --> 49:55.720]  So my thanks to the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast
[49:55.720 --> 49:57.600]  for sponsoring my podcast.
[49:58.760 --> 50:00.440]  You know, I walked away for a second,
[50:00.440 --> 50:02.040]  and I came back and you were talking about
[50:02.040 --> 50:03.920]  15 to 20 minute podcasts,
[50:03.920 --> 50:05.800]  and I thought, well, he's not talking about this one.
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.080]  You know, my other show with Ben, The Dithering,
[50:08.080 --> 50:12.240]  we do 15 minutes on the button every day,
[50:12.240 --> 50:13.080]  three times a week.
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.760]  That's the sweet spot.
[50:14.760 --> 50:15.580]  People love it.
[50:15.580 --> 50:19.880]  I really should, it does seem like it's the sweet spot.
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.200]  It's a really great,
[50:21.200 --> 50:23.480]  I can't tell you how many people have written to me and said,
[50:23.480 --> 50:24.860]  and they're always very nice,
[50:24.860 --> 50:27.280]  because they're fans, you know, people who read my website.
[50:27.280 --> 50:30.580]  And, you know, some people love long talk shows.
[50:30.580 --> 50:33.160]  You know, they love that this show is two hours long,
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.080]  because they have, you know,
[50:34.080 --> 50:36.040]  they just love listening to long podcasts.
[50:36.040 --> 50:37.320]  But there's other people who,
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.000]  you know, they're listening to us right now
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.180]  at like two X speed,
[50:41.180 --> 50:42.920]  and we sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.200]  having like intercourse.
[50:45.200 --> 50:47.720]  But so many people love the fact
[50:47.720 --> 50:49.320]  that Dithering is only 15 minutes long,
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.920]  because they don't want a long talk show.
[50:50.920 --> 50:53.320]  So to me, it's just one of those things
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.880]  where the sweet spot is either be really long
[50:55.880 --> 50:58.360]  or really short, one way or the other.
[50:58.360 --> 51:03.360]  Did you see Jack's bullshit last night?
[51:03.840 --> 51:04.680]  No, I did not.
[51:05.820 --> 51:06.860]  I had enough.
[51:06.860 --> 51:08.040]  Last night, I had enough.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.640]  I got off the internet.
[51:09.640 --> 51:11.600]  I was just, I can't take it.
[51:11.600 --> 51:13.560]  I couldn't take watchin' these Republicans
[51:13.560 --> 51:15.120]  vote against impeachment.
[51:15.120 --> 51:16.080]  Couldn't take it.
[51:16.080 --> 51:18.040]  Oh, I couldn't, I didn't watch any of that.
[51:18.040 --> 51:20.520]  Last night, the Wizard of Bitcoin got back
[51:20.520 --> 51:25.520]  and made his first public statement since booting Trump.
[51:25.520 --> 51:30.520]  He said it's, while he agreed with some difficulty,
[51:32.640 --> 51:36.680]  with having to kick Trump off,
[51:36.680 --> 51:39.800]  he believes it sets a very dangerous precedent.
[51:41.600 --> 51:45.920]  And then he started, he went into a weird Bitcoin promo.
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.520]  No, are you serious?
[51:47.520 --> 51:49.360]  Yeah, no, go look.
[51:49.360 --> 51:50.200]  It's all there.
[51:50.200 --> 51:54.240]  He went into a weird, and then he started
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.040]  talking about blockchain, and here's the scary part.
[52:00.800 --> 52:05.080]  He started talking about decentralized platforms
[52:07.480 --> 52:09.920]  and how that's the future of all this shit.
[52:12.360 --> 52:14.120]  And in combination with, I mean,
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.840]  did you see Sheryl Sandberg talking about
[52:16.840 --> 52:20.840]  how none of this capital riot planning
[52:20.840 --> 52:22.240]  happened on Facebook?
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.400]  No, I did not see that either.
[52:24.400 --> 52:25.680]  Oh yeah, she said that.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.040]  She said that.
[52:28.040 --> 52:31.240]  So you got people at Facebook saying,
[52:31.240 --> 52:34.680]  nah, it didn't happen here, we don't have a problem.
[52:34.680 --> 52:37.200]  And you got Jack saying, well, the only problem
[52:37.200 --> 52:40.960]  with our platform is that I'm still too close to the blame.
[52:43.920 --> 52:46.440]  And people have been talking about,
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.480]  like, this is tech's moment of reckoning.
[52:51.080 --> 52:54.400]  Because you've got all of this shit happening
[52:54.400 --> 52:57.560]  on Twitter and Facebook and,
[52:57.560 --> 53:00.440]  did they say parlay or parlor?
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.560]  So we, yeah.
[53:01.560 --> 53:02.680]  Parlay, yeah, because they're dumb.
[53:02.680 --> 53:03.520]  Yeah, they,
[53:04.760 --> 53:06.000]  And you've got.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.400]  But they have things, you could have a parlay
[53:09.400 --> 53:11.840]  with somebody on parlor, but they pronounce
[53:11.840 --> 53:16.760]  the name of the platform as parlor.
[53:16.760 --> 53:20.840]  You know, sometimes waking up and deciding to be,
[53:20.840 --> 53:24.120]  it's a decision that I'm gonna wake up and be dumb.
[53:24.120 --> 53:25.960]  It's a decision that people make.
[53:28.160 --> 53:30.800]  I mean, this is tech's moment of reckoning.
[53:30.800 --> 53:33.320]  Like all of this shit that's happening now is built,
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.120]  is happening because we built shit tools.
[53:37.120 --> 53:41.840]  And we didn't care to manage those tools.
[53:41.840 --> 53:45.000]  And we got them too big to manage in some cases
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.640]  and badly managed in other cases.
[53:47.640 --> 53:50.600]  It never really gave a shit about managing them
[53:50.600 --> 53:52.560]  in many of the cases.
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.560]  And now what we're hearing from the two biggest platforms,
[53:57.840 --> 54:02.240]  arguably, is, yeah, we still don't see a problem here.
[54:03.320 --> 54:04.960]  And that scares the hell out of me.
[54:04.960 --> 54:09.120]  Because we're not done.
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.360]  I mean, January 20th is not the goal line.
[54:13.360 --> 54:14.720]  It's not like the end of the race.
[54:14.720 --> 54:15.720]  We're not done here.
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.680]  I mean, we're getting one of the biggest idiots
[54:23.680 --> 54:25.440]  away from the nuclear codes.
[54:25.440 --> 54:27.040]  That happens January 20th,
[54:27.040 --> 54:29.960]  and that's all very appreciated.
[54:31.320 --> 54:34.440]  But these idiots that he riled up,
[54:34.440 --> 54:39.440]  and they were always, they were always these people,
[54:39.960 --> 54:43.360]  but they never felt quite as powerful as they did
[54:43.360 --> 54:45.840]  when he was in charge, and now they're riled up.
[54:47.600 --> 54:52.600]  To me, a clear place to draw the line of enforcement
[54:52.920 --> 54:57.560]  is to reaffirm our,
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.160]  and this sounds so high-faluting,
[55:01.160 --> 55:04.240]  but to reaffirm our culture and our society's
[55:04.240 --> 55:09.240]  commitment to the truth being important.
[55:09.400 --> 55:11.240]  Facts, right?
[55:11.240 --> 55:14.200]  Oh, our society's never been committed to that.
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.200]  But our, it's been our North Star, though, right?
[55:20.360 --> 55:22.240]  We've failed in so many ways,
[55:23.200 --> 55:26.480]  but we keep, that's the direction that we keep going, right?
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.480]  And it is, it goes back to the Enlightenment,
[55:31.480 --> 55:36.480]  and it ties political truths, like was this election fair?
[55:37.320 --> 55:40.520]  Did Joe Biden fairly win the election?
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.320]  It's every bit the same sort of thinking
[55:44.320 --> 55:48.920]  that got Galileo locked up by the Catholic Church,
[55:48.920 --> 55:51.240]  that he was doing science, right?
[55:51.240 --> 55:54.680]  And telling people things they didn't want to hear,
[55:54.680 --> 55:59.400]  and whether he was, whether what he said was true or not,
[55:59.400 --> 56:02.280]  and the science could be backed up by actual facts
[56:02.280 --> 56:04.400]  and observations, didn't matter, right?
[56:04.400 --> 56:06.440]  It's the same sort of thing.
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.440]  And it's, so like, where do you draw the line?
[56:09.440 --> 56:14.440]  You know, in terms of what sort of stuff going forward
[56:16.640 --> 56:19.680]  will not be tolerated on a platform like Twitter.
[56:19.680 --> 56:22.080]  And it's not about disagreeing, right?
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.000]  It's not, that is the, what's the Voltaire line?
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.640]  That I disagree with you, but I will fight to the end
[56:30.640 --> 56:32.240]  to support your right to say it.
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.800]  What can't be tolerated is promoting things
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.560]  that are obviously not true.
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.100]  That has to be, it cannot be tolerated.
[56:46.920 --> 56:48.600]  Do you remember when Zuckerberg said
[56:48.600 --> 56:49.920]  he was okay with Holocaust deniers?
[56:49.920 --> 56:50.760]  Yes, I do.
[56:52.200 --> 56:53.960]  That was terrifying.
[56:53.960 --> 56:56.120]  Right, right.
[56:56.120 --> 56:57.360]  That was fucking terrifying.
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.400]  It's really hard to imagine that.
[56:59.400 --> 57:04.080]  And it's such a slow boil, right?
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.260]  We're all frogs who've been in this slowly boiling pot,
[57:08.260 --> 57:10.960]  and now here we are, you know, getting burned.
[57:10.960 --> 57:13.760]  But it, like when you and I were kids,
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.440]  like could you imagine, it would be hard
[57:17.440 --> 57:19.680]  to describe Facebook, but it would be fair
[57:19.680 --> 57:22.040]  to say, you know, who's Mark Zuckerberg?
[57:22.040 --> 57:25.400]  He is a billionaire, self-made billionaire
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.520]  who was in control of a platform, a computer platform
[57:28.520 --> 57:31.720]  where people can post things, right?
[57:31.720 --> 57:33.800]  That's a description you could take back
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.000]  to your 1985 self, and it would make sense.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.280]  You can leave little messages for people.
[57:39.280 --> 57:41.160]  Right, you can leave messages for people.
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.360]  And this billionaire, who is very famous
[57:45.360 --> 57:47.920]  and his platform is exceedingly popular
[57:47.920 --> 57:51.280]  with billions of users, espouses the viewpoint
[57:51.280 --> 57:54.560]  that Holocaust denial is, while he doesn't,
[57:54.560 --> 57:56.840]  certainly doesn't endorse it and doesn't agree with it,
[57:56.840 --> 58:00.400]  it's tolerable speech on the platform.
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.840]  You wouldn't believe it.
[58:01.840 --> 58:05.040]  That in the past, that wouldn't, that's,
[58:05.040 --> 58:08.420]  it's hard to think of an issue
[58:08.420 --> 58:12.280]  that should be less tolerated, right, and wouldn't be.
[58:12.280 --> 58:15.680]  Like if you, it's hard for me
[58:15.680 --> 58:18.560]  to even articulate how ridiculous that is.
[58:18.560 --> 58:20.240]  But he said it, and he really meant it.
[58:20.240 --> 58:25.080]  It was like his thoughtful, considered idea.
[58:26.600 --> 58:28.720]  You know, yeah, he did.
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.560]  He said that.
[58:29.560 --> 58:30.400]  And I guess that.
[58:30.400 --> 58:32.200]  He said that, and we were,
[58:32.200 --> 58:35.760]  and here's what kills me about that.
[58:37.240 --> 58:39.720]  People kept working for him.
[58:39.720 --> 58:42.360]  I'm with you on that, and I've gotten an.
[58:42.360 --> 58:47.360]  People, I mean, people kept building that platform.
[58:47.360 --> 58:48.720]  That platform.
[58:50.200 --> 58:55.000]  I mean, I'm thinking if I was like a worker on that line,
[58:56.160 --> 59:00.260]  and if this were like a meat packing plant,
[59:01.640 --> 59:04.280]  and we're down there, like in the rendering pit,
[59:06.260 --> 59:10.560]  and we get word from on high, like, guess what?
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.360]  Stop separating the good meat from the bad meat.
[59:14.360 --> 59:17.360]  We're gonna sell it all.
[59:18.240 --> 59:20.760]  I would hope that me and you working next to each other
[59:20.760 --> 59:23.440]  would turn to each other and say like, what the hell?
[59:23.440 --> 59:24.280]  What?
[59:25.440 --> 59:27.100]  No, we couldn't have said that.
[59:28.160 --> 59:30.280]  Let's double check,
[59:30.280 --> 59:31.680]  because we're not gonna do that, Jon.
[59:31.680 --> 59:33.840]  We can't sell bad meat to the people.
[59:36.200 --> 59:37.940]  I mean, even for selfish reasons.
[59:37.940 --> 59:40.600]  What if some of this bad meat ends up on my kid's plate?
[59:40.600 --> 59:45.560]  I guess that part of what makes this argument have legs,
[59:45.560 --> 59:48.860]  this free speech, this argument that it is an issue
[59:48.860 --> 59:53.520]  of free speech, is that Zuckerberg's take on that issue
[59:53.520 --> 59:58.000]  was about Facebook as a public square, right?
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  It was him arguing that because he supports free speech,
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.520]  like, that he was, is it any wonder
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.520]  that critics now of his decision
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.000]  to kick Trump off the platform
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.520]  are calling it a violation of free speech,
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.360]  because Zuckerberg himself was promoting that mindset,
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.560]  that way of thinking about Facebook, right?
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.960]  If Zuckerberg wants his platform
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.440]  to be considered the public square,
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.400]  then his position of leadership
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.320]  should be up to a vote by the public,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.880]  the same as any other public office.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.400]  But it's not, is it?
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]  No, it's not.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  It's, you know, and it's just artful dancing, you know?
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.680]  It's sophistry to argue otherwise,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.880]  and it's in a way that we wouldn't tolerate it in real life.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.160]  You really wouldn't.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.560]  We wouldn't tolerate a workplace.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.640]  One way to look at this is that all these platforms
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.640]  kicked him off when he incited
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.760]  all that shit at the Capitol.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.960]  Another way to look at it is that they kicked him off
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.320]  when they were done milking the husk,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.720]  because what happened at the Capitol was atrocious.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.720]  I mean, I'm noting, there's,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.680]  I wouldn't wanna talk to anybody
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.080]  who would debate that point.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.720]  But if you look at what he's done in four years in power,
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.680]  there have been so many other moments
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.400]  that were just as atrocious.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  And that you could have seen
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.200]  that this is where it was inevitably going,
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.360]  something violent, right?
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.360]  And the fact that those didn't give Jack Dorsey
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.280]  or Mark Zuckerberg cause is disgraceful.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.040]  So I think it was a combination of,
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.560]  you know, there was some math.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.880]  There was some math done there,
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.880]  and it was accounting math.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.260]  This is terrible times.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.300]  Well, we're done with him anyway.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:27.300]  All right, yeah, it's, there's, you know,
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.220]  I've reused the phrase better late than never
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.800]  more times than I should have probably in the last week.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.960]  And I still agree with it.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.500]  I don't think that they should have said,
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.440]  well, now it's too late.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.480]  He's only got 10 days left in office.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.560]  Why kick him off now?
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.460]  We'll wait till he's out.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.480]  I don't, you know, I think it was better
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.160]  that they did it when they did
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.920]  than not having done it at all.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.040]  Totally agree, totally agree.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.080]  Can you, I mean, this isn't,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.620]  the amount of damage that he could do in 10 days.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]  It's unbelievable.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.640]  I mean, just, just think back.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.640]  I mean, when, when, when was the impeachment vote?
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.600]  The first one?
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.960]  There was one yesterday.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.400]  John, a president was impeached
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.320]  in the United States yesterday.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.000]  Does it feel like that?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.840]  No, it doesn't.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.880]  It's bizarre.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.820]  I mean, when we were kids,
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.220]  there was, you know, the Buchanan impeachment,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.400]  which, you know, is something weird
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.720]  and that happened back then when, you know,
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.680]  men wore wigs and had top hat.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.800]  Lamb chop sideburns.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.280]  Bullshit.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.000]  Yeah, lamb chop sideburns.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.440]  And then all of a sudden there was the Clinton impeachment.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.280]  You're like, whoa.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.480]  Well, and there was Nixon, right?
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.660]  Like we grew up in the post-Nixon world.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.720]  Right, right.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.620]  Except Nixon wasn't, I mean, wasn't impeached.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.460]  He had the decency to quit.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.200]  But yeah, then we lived through the Clinton impeachment
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.560]  and it was like, holy shit, this is such a big deal.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.960]  This may be like, this is such a big moment.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.960]  And in the last year, we've lived through two more.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.060]  Same guy.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:20.040]  And yesterday's was just like, oh yeah, he was impeached.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.600]  What are we having for dinner?
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.760]  That's very true.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.120]  Honestly, I was at the end of my rope yesterday.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.880]  Like Overton's window has so much plywood
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.040]  on it at this point.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.440]  But to me, the thing to keep coming back to
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.080]  as a first principle is a commitment to truth
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.240]  and that the spreading of lies simply cannot be tolerated.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.120]  And that's where it all starts.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.520]  I mean, there are all sorts of political viewpoints
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.640]  that people can espouse that I disagree with vehemently,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.640]  but I would support your ability to espouse them,
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.100]  but not spreading lies.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.180]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.280]  I mean, because that's the other thing too about this.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.240]  And one thing I've been saying to people
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.960]  and trying to think about and trying to do myself
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.360]  when I'm writing about this and talking about it
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.760]  is to target the liars,
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.800]  not the people who believe the lies.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.000]  That doesn't mean I forgive the people
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.200]  who believe the lie that this election is rigged
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.720]  and that they're not complicit in it
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.340]  and that they don't bear responsibility.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:34.060]  But to me, it's the people who knowingly spread the lies
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.480]  and promoted this that deserve our ire
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.080]  because it's the bigger problem.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.300]  Well, the bigger, bigger problem.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.140]  Do you wanna talk about the bigger, bigger problem?
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.980]  Yeah, I do.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.460]  What do you think?
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.300]  We were ready.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.700]  I mean, we'll believe anything that these idiots say
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:53.700]  because ultimately, we're freaked out as fuck
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:57.860]  that we really like the idea of a white America
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.180]  and it's going away.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.900]  And so we'll happily elect anybody
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.140]  who keeps talking about that
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.260]  and we'll believe anything that they have to say.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.560]  Don't you think that's partly really,
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.800]  like the how did this happen?
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:23.060]  How in the world did this mob break into the Capitol?
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.780]  And I feel like the, right?
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.620]  They were let in.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:29.820]  Well, it's some places, and why weren't they,
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.340]  people have pointed out repeatedly
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.980]  the difference in the nature of the preparations
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.620]  that in the same city, Washington, D.C.,
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:43.980]  that they did over in June for Black Lives Matter protests
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.540]  and had National Guard troops wearing camouflage
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.500]  and body armor to protect the Lincoln Memorial of all.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.540]  That's where somebody had photos of it.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.540]  It's not even far less.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.680]  It's just a memorial, right?
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.740]  It's just a stat.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:03.740]  I heard, gee, I heard it.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:10.220]  So why wasn't Congress protected similarly for this?
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.940]  And I don't think, I think part of it
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.340]  is a bit of a conspiracy,
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.000]  and I think that there are some sympathetic,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.860]  I mean, we've seen the pictures
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.780]  that some of the police were taking selfies
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.020]  with the people they should've been arresting.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:22.980]  But I think.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.100]  Because white people can get away with it.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.060]  Because white people can get away with this shit.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.980]  There's, is there any question that with the exact,
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.700]  if January 6th had been a Black Lives Matter protest
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.860]  of the same size, you know, 10,000 people, 15,000 people,
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.440]  however many people were there for this protest,
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.500]  that they would've been,
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.580]  it would've been an entirely different security setup
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.380]  around the Capitol.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:56.060]  It would've been entirely different.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.860]  The closest body, and I mean body,
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.500]  wouldn't have made it within 50 foot of the Capitol steps.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.860]  And they would've been shot.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.020]  Black people attacking the Capitol
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.420]  would've been shot on sight.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.960]  Well, I was thinking about this.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.420]  I don't even think that,
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.040]  they would've if they had tried to,
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.300]  but they wouldn't have tried.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:19.740]  And one of the things while the actual riot was ensuing,
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.220]  and we had footage of it, and we could see it,
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.940]  and then in the days afterwards
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:27.740]  when the cell phone video and stuff like that came out,
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.940]  the thing that's so shocking is how the perpetrators,
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.660]  the mob, they weren't scared in the least bit.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.500]  There was, you know, like, I saw.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.740]  They've never had to be.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.220]  They've never had to be.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:45.380]  I saw firsthand, I saw looting here in Philadelphia
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:50.020]  back in June when the protests went bad.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.140]  And the one thing, it was very clear
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:59.140]  that the people doing it had that nervous energy
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:05.380]  of people who thought they might be shot at any moment,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.100]  right, like the people just running,
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.740]  people just running out of a Modell Sporting Goods
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.500]  with a fistful of sneakers, boxes of sneakers.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.020]  They had that nervous energy
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  where there was sort of a giddy rush of, you know, mayhem.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.180]  But they also had the nervous energy
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.900]  of people who wouldn't have been the least bit surprised
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.380]  to hear gunshots coming from police officers at any moment.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.700]  Whereas this crowd who took the Capitol,
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.020]  they were strolling.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.420]  Like that numbskull from Florida
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.220]  who stole Nancy Pelosi's podium, he was posing.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.540]  You know, and again, it's not that, you know,
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.460]  not even did they think that they'd be arrested or whatever,
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.380]  but there was no fear that they were going to be shot.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.780]  It is, so I don't think Black Lives Matter,
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.260]  black protesters would have never tried this
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.860]  because they would have assumed they'd be shot.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.100]  Of course.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.460]  It is crazy, it's insane that they,
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.540]  because they were white and looked like,
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.340]  well, they're certainly, you know,
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.500]  white people certainly wouldn't barge in
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.300]  and storm the Capitol.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.220]  So, you know, we don't need any extra security.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.460]  Well, they don't have to, they're invited in.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.420]  They were invited in.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.820]  And I don't mean just that day.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.340]  They were invited in the day before.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.980]  They were given tours by some of the Congress people.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.300]  Did you see stories about that?
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:36.100]  I've seen some, like with this Bobert woman.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100]  Well, I forget her first name,
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.140]  but she's the one who made the video that went viral,
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:44.060]  bragging about the fact that she planned to carry a,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.220]  this is before, you know, before this happened,
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.180]  that she was going to carry a gun around Congress
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.660]  and became an internet sensation.
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:56.060]  But I saw that, I think it was her
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.980]  who brought people in the day before.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.340]  Yeah, she was giving people tours.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.300]  The same people who would go to riot the next day.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:07.580]  Well, and then her speech, you know, you have to see it.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.980]  I think the transcript alone doesn't convey
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.580]  the sense of what she's saying,
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.260]  but when she gave a speech during the fight
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.460]  over whether to certify this election,
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.460]  she said, I have constituents who are out there right now.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.260]  And the way she said it was very clear.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.780]  It wasn't just, oh, that's an unfortunate way of saying it
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.500]  because she knew she had constituents
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.340]  who were at the protest.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:30.060]  She knew that they were coming to storm the Capitol.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.180]  You know, all you need to know
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.180]  about how fair this election was
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.580]  is how much conservatives are fighting against it.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.660]  Explain.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.100]  I think this is probably the most fair election
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.020]  we've ever had, and I think Georgia supports that.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.180]  And oh my God, the work that Stacey Abrams did.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.540]  That's unbelievable, right?
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:12:00.540]  She's quite possibly one of the most effective leaders
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.020]  that in my adult lifetime
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.620]  that we've ever had in our nation.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.380]  What she did in Georgia is just astounding,
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.300]  and it's the diligent hard work, right?
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.060]  So for people who don't follow,
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.900]  she had a, you know, talk about a rigged election.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.820]  She lost the governor's race in Georgia.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.500]  And I know that that's sort of the dastardly thing
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.700]  that Trump has this ability of saying,
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.580]  you know, that because he wants to,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:30.780]  he made lock her up a chant, right?
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.780]  And therefore, then when he faces the law,
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.260]  come January 21st, he and his supporters
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.540]  can say that this is just retribution
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.100]  because it's, you know, same reason that he said lock her up.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.420]  Now they're saying lock him up,
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.580]  and it doesn't, you know, you can't say,
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.220]  I trust me, they'll make the argument.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.060]  They'll say, you can't say that Hillary Clinton
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.500]  should not have been chanted against,
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.540]  lock her up, and now turn around
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.540]  and say that Trump should be locked up.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.020]  But that's, it's just nonsense
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.820]  because she didn't commit crimes.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.260]  He did.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.860]  Yeah, there were no crimes.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.860]  I mean, I believe it was Stacey Abrams who said,
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.500]  and if I'm wrong about this quote, forgive me,
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.080]  but I believe that she was the one who said,
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.420]  the South is not red, the South is suppressed.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.540]  And she proved that.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.460]  She proved that in Georgia, at least.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:36.460]  And I think the conservatives issue with this election
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:43.380]  was that, holy shit, our rigging didn't work.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.900]  Our rigging didn't work.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.740]  We have been rigging these elections forever.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.740]  Forever.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:00.040]  And somehow this woman and her organization
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.880]  and all of her people managed to do the impossible
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:09.380]  and they got all these people to vote
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:12.680]  who we didn't want voting.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.840]  I saw a fascinating interview back during,
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.040]  remember, how long ago was that?
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.300]  Like that week between the election
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.200]  and the networks calling it officially for Biden.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.400]  That was 16 years ago.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.760]  I was watching MSNBC and I think it was
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.520]  at some point midweek, it was after the election
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.800]  and before the networks called it,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.840]  but at a point where the state of Wisconsin
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.540]  was officially called for Biden.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.440]  And they had the, I forget,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.360]  doesn't matter what his name is,
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.860]  but the guy who was in charge
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.640]  of the Democratic National Committee in Wisconsin
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.160]  on MSNBC and they were congratulating him
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.280]  and saying this was a lot closer
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.760]  than the polls were saying Wisconsin would be.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.600]  You did a great job.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.840]  And he just said, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.480]  Let me just say right now,
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.080]  I don't deserve anywhere near as much credit
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.560]  for Wisconsin as you're giving me.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.840]  Stacey Abrams does.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.080]  And they're like, well, she was running it in Georgia.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.040]  And he goes, no, you don't understand.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.600]  She came up here last year in 2019
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.720]  and took a look at our organization
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.480]  and told us, she left us with a plan
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.840]  that we followed to a T
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.140]  and we realized we had no plan.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.040]  It's not just Georgia.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.520]  She is, really, she's like a genius
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.160]  at an organizational level of following,
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.200]  like writing a computer program.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.760]  Do this, do that, if this, then do this,
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.640]  then do this and do the hard work.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.620]  And the thing that is so astounding to me
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.140]  is that she got to work on this
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.600]  as soon as she had that election stolen
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.400]  from her in Georgia, just immediately.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.260]  No time of self-pity, no wallowing,
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.960]  just got to work and look at this.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.640]  It's really unbelievable.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.520]  And so Biden didn't need any one of these states, right?
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.640]  Georgia could have been a few thousand votes
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.640]  in the other direction and Trump could have won Georgia
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.240]  and Biden still wins the election, but he needed a bunch.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.480]  And if Georgia hadn't been for Biden
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.240]  and Wisconsin hadn't, and Wisconsin was so close.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.920]  This guy was saying, if Stacey Abrams
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.040]  hadn't helped Democrats in Wisconsin,
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.360]  he said, we would have lost.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.960]  There's no question in his mind.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.400]  I mean, this is, you know, right after the election,
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.380]  people, I saw people like,
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:43.880]  well, this isn't the landslide we thought it would be.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.880]  And I was like, holy shit, it was absolutely a landslide.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.940]  It had to be a landslide.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:57.180]  It had to be a landslide to get through all of the barriers
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.420]  and just get to the other side.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.240]  And we were never gonna get to the other side
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.920]  with, you know, 50 million more votes than the other dude.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.920]  Right, but it took, it took everything.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.000]  I think it's just so hard to articulate
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.120]  how close we came to losing this,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.880]  and really losing democracy, I mean.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:24.720]  I don't think we're out of the fire.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.600]  Oh, I don't think so either, right?
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.880]  We're still in a straw house with a bunch of people
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.040]  flicking matches, you know, at the walls.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.400]  Yeah.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.380]  We just don't have a fire right at the moment,
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.040]  but if Trump had won, man, you could see it.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.560]  That was it, that was it.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.400]  And I know it sounds like hyperbole,
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.520]  and people, you know, what, I know.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.480]  You know, in 2016, in 26, no, wait, 2017, I'm sorry.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.640]  In 2017, I was going around,
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.320]  and I was doing a talk called How to Fight Fascism.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.500]  And you know, mostly like online shit,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.720]  but catchy title, so I ran with it.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.840]  And I made mention several times in the talk
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.840]  about fascist activities online and things like that.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.880]  And after, the first time I did it,
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.920]  during the Q&A, somebody stood up,
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.760]  and they were like,
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.800]  you can't just call anyone you don't like a fascist.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.240]  And I was like,
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.240]  you know I'm talking about actual fascists here, right?
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.680]  This isn't just me like picking a dirty word
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.200]  to call people who hurt my feelings.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.280]  We're talking actual fascists.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.700]  Didn't see it, people didn't see it.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.040]  There's, you don't hear it,
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.220]  I don't know why the word sort of disappeared,
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.440]  but for a while, people would talk about fanboys.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.420]  And I had this line, you know,
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:04.840]  people would accuse me of being an Apple fanboy, right?
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.160]  I lost count of how many times I faced that accusation.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.880]  And my zinger was that I enjoyed collecting
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.920]  remarks from people,
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.220]  who's the guy who owns the Dallas Mavericks?
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.880]  He's one, Mark Cuban.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.280]  Yeah, he's one of them.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.960]  Where these people's definition of a Mac Apple
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.280]  or a Mac fanboy is somebody,
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.740]  anybody who was into Apple's devices before they were.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.840]  Right?
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.400]  It's like the moment that Mark Cuban became a Mac user
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.680]  and started espousing how great the platform was.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.740]  But in the past, he had accused people of being wrong.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:48.080]  It's the same sort of mindset where it's like,
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.440]  these people, they don't acknowledge that we were right
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.520]  that Trump was a deranged lunatic and a danger,
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.240]  a menace to the nation and the world.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.160]  And they called this, what did they call it?
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.320]  Trump derangement syndrome, right?
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.520]  And instead of saying, huh, you guys were right,
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.520]  this guy was a menace to the world.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.520]  Their perspective is, no, you were still wrong
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.600]  and it was all hyperbole.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.440]  It's just that I came around to the idea
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.500]  that he's dangerous at the right time,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.640]  which was right when there's a nitwit
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.320]  running around the halls of Congress
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.640]  with a Confederate flag inside the building.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.040]  Anybody, anybody who knew what the hell
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.640]  they were talking about or had any sense of history
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.560]  saw this four years ago or more.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.040]  You know Sarah Kensyer who wrote Hiding in Plain Sight?
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040]  Oh yes, yes, Hiding in Plain Sight.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.040]  Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.340]  And I mean, she's been talking about this shit
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.680]  on Twitter forever and she nailed it.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.040]  Like she, back when Trump started doing his thing,
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.440]  she was like, here's what's going to happen
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.400]  piece by piece by piece by piece
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.320]  and it'll happen in this order.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.280]  And all of those things happened.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.880]  Right, but it's like, there's these,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.540]  it's almost like people are arguing at the meta level
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.880]  saying you can't call the president fascist.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.160]  But that's not the argument.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.000]  Well, you can't.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.800]  Right, that's the thing is it's like
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.480]  this bizarre viewpoint that it can't be,
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:25.660]  that the president can't be a narcissistic sociopath.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.040]  That just can't be.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.120]  Yes, it can be.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.540]  It absolutely can be.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.600]  You know where else I see this a lot?
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.680]  Is when guys decide that their friends
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.840]  didn't fuck up because they're good guys.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.320]  Right, right.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.760]  So you define the person
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.480]  and then every action that they take
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.720]  falls under that umbrella that you've decided
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.160]  that person is versus defining their actions.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.160]  No, that's a very good analogy, yeah.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.320]  It's how high up in the stack your priorities are.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.360]  And if the, if.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.880]  So Steve, Steve can do good things
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.500]  and he can do some bad things.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.600]  And we call Steve on the bad things he does
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.400]  and we praise him for the good things he does
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.040]  rather than Steve's a good guy.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.840]  Therefore, everything Steve does is good.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.000]  And you hear Trump talk in that way about people too.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.680]  Like oh, Epstein, good dude, good dude.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.520]  Yeah.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.040]  One of. Anybody.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:38.200]  Well, one of my favorite moments of this whole thing,
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.280]  because it really was a light bulb going off in my head
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.120]  was back when Woodward's book came out in August.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.600]  Talk about something that feels like it was 16 years ago.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.480]  But Bob Woodward's second book comes out
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.360]  and Trump, and it contains all sorts of scathing,
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.080]  just absolutely scathing facts
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.800]  about the lunacy of this man.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.800]  And Trump was talking about his phone calls with Woodward.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.800]  And I guess, I think it's because Woodward had tapes, right?
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.240]  He taped all the phone calls.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.120]  And he's playing, I think he was on the Colbert Show
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.160]  and Woodward is playing a tape of Trump talking to him
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.800]  and he's like, just tell me Bob, is it a good book?
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.800]  And what Trump meant clearly about a good book
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.040]  is whether it was flattering to him or not.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.240]  It had nothing to do with is it actually interesting?
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.520]  Is it historically significant reporting?
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.080]  Is it well written?
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.600]  Are the sentences good?
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.120]  Or even is it printed well?
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.800]  Is it a nice book to hold?
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.800]  He thinks a good book is a book that was flattering to him.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.880]  And that's it.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.520]  Of course, yeah.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.200]  Very fair, very fair to me, very fair.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.880]  Said nice things.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.320]  And he's even said to him, he's like,
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.600]  your last book, it was terrible, it was a terrible book.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.700]  And I'm telling you Bob, if you write a good book,
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.140]  it'll sell, trust me.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.440]  That's what people want to read.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.060]  A book telling the world how great he is.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:06.920]  Speaking of books.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.320]  Yeah, well let me take a break
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.240]  and thank our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.240]  Oh man, Squarespace is back for 2021 sponsoring the show.

[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.960]  start a new website.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.640]  You have a website idea for a website
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.800]  or an existing website you need to improve.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.440]  You should take a look at Squarespace.

[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.920]  So let's do it, let's talk about your book.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.760]  You have a new book.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.240]  How many books have you written, Mike?
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.320]  This is number four.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.120]  What in, and the name of the new book is?
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.600]  The Collected Anger.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.240]  I love that, I love the cover.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.140]  Are you sending me a copy?
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.840]  I don't have it yet.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.680]  Yeah, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm absolutely sending you a copy.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.400]  Can we talk about this typeface?
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.620]  I love, did you design the cover, did you do the cover?
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.440]  I did.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.180]  I mean, I'm only talking about the typeface
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.560]  because I wanna give props to the type designer.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.440]  Otherwise, I would be yelling at you
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.160]  for starting a conversation about a book
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.600]  by talking about a typeface.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.200]  The typeface is Bayard.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.300]  How do you spell that?
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.960]  God, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960]  How do you spell it?
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.080]  B-A-Y-A-R-D.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.680]  B-A-Y-A-R-D, I would say Bayard.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.300]  Bayard, and it's by Vocal Type.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.520]  And Vocal Type, I think Vocal Type is just one person.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.800]  Trey.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.160]  But in case they're not, I'll keep saying they
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.160]  and referring to Vocal Type.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.400]  Vocal Type is making typefaces
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.760]  based on civil rights signs.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.740]  And the lettering style of that era.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.500]  Yeah, and they're beautiful.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.680]  I mean, not only are the typefaces beautiful,
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.760]  but the fonts themselves,
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:10.760]  they've done a really fantastic job making quality stuff.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.200]  Yeah, like technically speaking, open types of stuff.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.800]  They're visually stunning and technically robust.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.520]  Here's the thing about this typeface,
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.280]  and we can talk about the book more,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.640]  but the thing about this typeface,
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.640]  I would love to just give you,
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.600]  you and I, we are publicly,
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.200]  we give each other a hard time, right?
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.240]  We bust each other's balls.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.760]  I would love to bust your balls about it, but I can't,
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.420]  because it is the perfect font for your voice.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.800]  It is somehow, it is you.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.400]  It's hard to believe that this typeface wasn't made
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]  just for you to use on this book.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.240]  It is.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.080]  Well, it wasn't.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.440]  Considering where it came from and its history,
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.040]  I'm honored that you would say that,
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.680]  and mostly I'm relieved that I haven't embarrassed it.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.000]  So what is the book about?
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.080]  The subtitle is Essays About Design
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.600]  for an Unwilling Audience.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.960]  Explain.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.480]  This is the book that you put together
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.200]  when you've been sitting at home for 10 months
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.380]  under quarantine.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.220]  You can barely put two words together to write anything new,
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.860]  and you start reading over your old stuff,
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.400]  and realizing that some of this old stuff is pretty good,
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.520]  pretty good, and it's scattered all over the internet.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.520]  And who knows how long the internet's gonna be around.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.640]  And there was definitely, I mean,
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.680]  that was definitely a concern during the campaign
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.720]  that we might all be living in caves
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.920]  eating nuts and berries.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.160]  And at that point, I wanted you to have a book.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.160]  It's nowhere near as funny as it would've sounded years ago,
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.140]  but it is still funny.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.160]  That's sad, that's sad how close we came.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.520]  Anyway, I really just wanted to put all the old stuff
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.880]  together in a volume.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.040]  And if you've read the other three books,
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.040]  one, thank you, and two, some of this may sound familiar.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:39.040]  Familiar, because the way that I write everything
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.040]  is I start with an essay, or what we used to call blog posts.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.560]  You start with an essay, and then at some point,
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.000]  some of them were like, hey, wait a minute,
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.200]  I wanna turn that one in with talk.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:01.240]  Or that one is actually, let's blow that up
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.460]  into a whole book, or that one may be the chapter of a book.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.640]  So they kind of become like Lego pieces.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.160]  And you break up the essays
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.680]  and recombine them with other things.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.000]  So they've all been, some of them have come out
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.300]  as parts of books.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.800]  If you've seen a talk here and there,
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.580]  some of this will sound familiar.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:34.740]  But this is all that stuff in its original essay form.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.720]  Where can people find this book?
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.620]  They can go everywhere, everywhere.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:46.600]  My preferred method is if you go to bookshop.org
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.160]  and get it there, because they kick back
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:56.640]  a percentage of the cash to local independent bookshops.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:01.300]  Isn't that, talk about things that it just,
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.320]  try explaining to your 30-year-old self
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.820]  that bookshops would be in danger in the year 2020.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.480]  And you would think, what, is there an apocalypse?
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.640]  I mean, and I guess we do have a pandemic
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.680]  and it has furthered the stress.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.600]  And so that actually is a furthered stress point.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.600]  But of all this sort of, it does.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.560]  It sounds like something out of an Orwell book,
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.700]  the idea that bookshops are endangered.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.080]  I still find it incredibly hard to believe
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.160]  that Borders is gone.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.680]  And I know that that's not an independent bookstore,
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.160]  but it's like.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.600]  I get what you mean, yeah.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.560]  How could that be?
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.800]  Anyway, so.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.760]  I mean, Borders was kind of,
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.960]  like either Borders or Barnes & Noble
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.960]  was like every little book-reading nerd's first bookstore.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.760]  We had, at the mall where I grew up,
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.360]  we had a Walden Books, and what was the other one?
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.760]  Walden Books, that's what you want.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.200]  Yeah, but I think Walden Books,
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.640]  one of them was like the sub-brand for Borders,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.760]  and one of them was the sub-brand for,
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.920]  what's the other big mega-chain?
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.720]  Oh, it was like some initial thing,
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.160]  like W.H. Auden?
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.160]  I loved, I don't know.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.360]  I always, it's just,
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.000]  my parents would have to drag me
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.480]  out of the bookstore at the mall.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.840]  It was just what I was, it just felt like heaven.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:41.680]  I don't know.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.840]  I would be willing to go on any mall trip with my parents
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.960]  because I would escape and go to the bookstore.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.240]  I was just thinking about that too.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.400]  I was thinking about how I used to,
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.480]  we used to go do our grocery shopping
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.200]  at Pathmark once a week, and I would go with my mom,
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.960]  and I would just go to the newsstand,
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.720]  and I could tell you, I was thinking about this in bed.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.400]  I was, I could tell you,
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.920]  I don't remember almost anything else about that Pathmark,
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.680]  but I could tell you how to get to where the magazines were,
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.160]  and I would.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.200]  Did you have the little racist books?
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.000]  Oh yeah, yeah, the little.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.040]  You remember the little racist joke book?
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:23.040]  Yeah, but I don't think I sold those at Pathmark, right?
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.320]  Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, at the registers.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.920]  No, and it'd be like, yeah, there'd be like,
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.400]  oh my God, that's so true, that it would be like.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.240]  They were two in ones.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.080]  You flipped it over.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.960]  It'd be like Polish jokes on the one side
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.760]  and Italian jokes on the other side, right?
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.600]  Right.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.440]  Yeah, and they would just sell them
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.120]  at the checkout at the supermarket.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.760]  Yep.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.840]  My favorite day, and I should have subscribed,
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840]  but.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.960]  In some ways, in some ways, we have come a long way
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.920]  as a society, in some way.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.120]  They sold Polish joke books at the cash register,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.840]  and at the supermarket.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.560]  And that is so true that you'd turn it upside down
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:10.560]  and from the back forward, it'd be like Italian jokes.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.040]  That's unbelievable.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:13.880]  Yep.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.920]  Yeah, I loved going to the supermarket for that reason,
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.040]  and I would buy Mad Magazine,
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.400]  so I wouldn't read Mad Magazine there,
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.560]  and my mom would let me buy it.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.200]  I would read all the other magazines
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.640]  that she wouldn't let me buy.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.400]  Right, that's a good strategy right there.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.080]  Right, that's like maximize my reading material.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:40.080]  And the supermarket, unlike a neighborhood shop, right?
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:44.120]  We had a neighborhood coffee shop type place
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.960]  that sold comic books, and the guy would come out.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.880]  Jake, he was the guy who owned the place.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.720]  If you sat there, he'd give,
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.600]  this ain't a library, kids.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.240]  So we'd go in there and start reading the comic books
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.880]  we didn't wanna buy until the man who owned the store
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.440]  would say, get out of here, or buy it.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.080]  The Pathmark didn't care.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.120]  They didn't care if I sat there
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.360]  and read Newsweek cover to cover.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.880]  They did not, they did not.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.360]  It felt like I was getting away with something.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.400]  That's because your mom was walking around
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.080]  filling a grocery basket, a giant cart,
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.640]  which probably totaled $60.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.520]  Well, the other thing, yeah, totally.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.440]  You fill a cart for like $60.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.560]  47 bucks.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.800]  Yep, and then they complain.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.840]  That's too much.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.560]  Well, it always astounded me
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.320]  that there were other kids in the supermarket
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:43.000]  who weren't doing the same thing.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.560]  Like, why aren't you here reading with me?
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.080]  What in the world are you doing?
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.600]  Why would you wanna walk up and down
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.000]  the aisles of a supermarket?
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.360]  We've really come a long way.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.360]  Anyway, the book looks great.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.080]  I am looking forward to getting my copy from you
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.920]  because I don't wanna buy it.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.280]  But if I were going to buy it, I would go to bookshop.org,
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.840]  buy it from an independent seller.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.360]  But you could find this book anywhere that books are sold.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.440]  Anything else you wanna?
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.200]  We're not using the name of that other place,
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.400]  but yeah, it's there too.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:25.120]  I know you've got some, a lot of Apple aficionados,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.480]  let's say, who listen to this.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.680]  It's available as an ebook at the Apple bookstore.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.320]  Well, get it any, literally, anywhere books are sold.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.440]  Anything else you wanna promote,
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.400]  people can find you on Twitter,
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.880]  at Montero, M-O-N-T-E-I-R-O.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.440]  Unless I've been suspended,
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.880]  which happens every couple weeks now.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.000]  You used to be Mike for the Win, Mike F-T-W.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.880]  How did you pronounce your old Twitter handle?
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.680]  Did you say Mike for the Win or Mike F-T-W?
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.320]  I think I would say F-T-W, underscore F-T-W.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.360]  That was a long time ago.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.760]  I never, I didn't know, I'm not good with acronyms.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.000]  I didn't know what F-T-W stood for for a long time.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.960]  But you and I were friends and I knew it was your handle
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.480]  and I really didn't, I thought it was like,
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.760]  fuck the world or something.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:16.960]  I wasn't even sure.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.840]  I hear that one a lot too from people.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.240]  And you know, when they thought it meant that,
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.360]  I was, you know, fine, run with it, run with it.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.320]  But anyway.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.040]  Just keep favoring, call it.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.680]  Because, you know, that pays my rent.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.760]  This has been, for me, a stress relief.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.760]  I enjoyed talking about this with you
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.180]  and I'm really glad to have had you on the show.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.040]  And it's one of those episodes of my show
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.040]  where, in hindsight, who else would I have had on this week
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.640]  to talk about these machickiness other than you, really?
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.800]  I always love coming on this show, Jon,
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.340]  and I want to apologize because your regular listeners
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:07.840]  probably stopped listening about an hour and 30 minutes ago.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.780]  Yeah, well, we'll send them over
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.080]  from your Twitter account, though.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.160]  There you go.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.720]  Well, but that's the other thing, too.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.960]  And let me just say this.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.820]  You know, regularly scheduled programming will come back.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.840]  But four years ago, Merlin came on the show
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.360]  after the election and we had a,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.640]  we called it a holiday party.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.480]  I was drunk.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:30.480]  This November, Merlin came back on
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.340]  and I was not drunk because Biden had won.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.940]  There are times when, to me, and I get it.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.920]  So you drink when you're sad but not happy?
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.560]  I drank too much after Trump won four years ago,
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.400]  to be honest.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.400]  I mean, it was a temporary coping mechanism
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  that I should've had the wherewithal as a grown man
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.000]  to stare it in the face.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.200]  But I couldn't, honestly.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:10.200]  And again, I, again, I don't want to lord this over.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:14.000]  I'm not looking for my son Jonas's famous
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.280]  being right points, our family currency
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.720]  here in the Gruber household.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.560]  I love a being right point.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.400]  I don't really want it.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.520]  I'm not looking for, yes, you were right.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.960]  But I saw, you know, I didn't know how it would happen.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.240]  But it's like, every president,
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.240]  which president has ever not faced a major crisis?
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.420]  And that's the way the world works.
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:39.320]  That's the job.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.800]  And when this man was faced with a crisis,
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.680]  he was going to do the exact wrong thing.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.000]  And here we are, you know, with the goddamn pandemic.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:49.920]  Among other things.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.580]  Well, also, let's not jinx it.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.640]  Let's not jinx it,
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.120]  because I don't know when this is being released.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.160]  But I'm still looking at six days.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.600]  Well, I've had that count, I've put a countdown
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.420]  on my website before the election.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.400]  And then, I forget who it was, but after the election,
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.160]  just a little number up in the corner.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.840]  And somebody said, you should bring it back
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.000]  and make it for Inauguration Day.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.040]  And I've had it up for, I don't know, 90 days or something.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.040]  I greatly enjoy seeing it now in the single digits,
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.400]  but I really, really cannot wait for that number to be zero.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.760]  How much do you think we're gonna sleep?
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.760]  My wife has said she cannot believe
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.920]  how much better she's sleeping
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.280]  now that his Twitter is unplugged.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.320]  And she gets up before I do.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.080]  I'm the night owl.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.080]  She wakes up earlier.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.080]  And the oddest ritual that I didn't anticipate
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.520]  how it would make me feel is that I no longer wake up
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.880]  and say to her, anything?
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.400]  Meaning, what has Trump been tweeting about today?
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.580]  For years, that's how we've spent
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.980]  most of the last four years, is my, good morning.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.800]  Anything?
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.280]  You know?
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.440]  No, he's golfing, you know?
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.880]  Or, nope, oh, wait till you see it.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.020]  He's gone off on whatever.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.460]  It is an incredible relief, it is.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.400]  That was the really terrifying part,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.700]  is that it could have been literally anything.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.100]  It is, it's like when you have a browser tab
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.960]  that's consuming a huge chunkier CPU
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.620]  and it makes everything on your computer,
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.340]  your scrolling's a little janky.
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:43.340]  Having that tab closed, in my mind, is unbelievable.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.700]  I feel like I've gained 20 IQ points.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.100]  I feel like I just shut down an Adobe product.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.300]  You know, it's the same way, you hear,
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:53.940]  I'm trying to wrap this up, but it's like
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.780]  when you go through, when you personally,
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:59.740]  or a loved one goes through a health crisis of any kind,
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.020]  you can't get anything else done.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.340]  It's too consuming.
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.680]  You just can't, you know, it's,
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.820]  you'd like to think you can, you know,
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.660]  and that you can compartmentalize stuff.
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:13.820]  But when something like that is weighing in your head,
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.960]  you know, that this idiot might start a war with a tweet,
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.900]  it's crazy.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.980]  Well, anyway, I am so glad to get this off my chest.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.700]  Good talking to you.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.780]  Last show, this will almost certainly be the last episode
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.540]  of the talk show in the Trump administration.
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.900]  That feels good.
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:36.820]  Maybe the Dorsey administration, too.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.020]  You know what we talk about?
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.460]  What did we not talk about?
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.580]  What the hell happened?
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:46.380]  Like, if you had been a, like,
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:50.600]  to be a fly on the wall inside Twitter,
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.340]  I mean, there's no inside Twitter.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.660]  It was probably all over Zoom or something.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.460]  But the actual conversation where,
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:02.300]  and I'm guessing, I'm guessing there were probably
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:07.300]  like a pack of pretty high up employees
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:11.740]  who went in at once and were like, enough.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.060]  I would love to see it documented.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:15.340]  I, it's, Ben Thompson and I have talked about this,
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.320]  that for all my criticism, I think Facebook
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.340]  is a far greater threat to society than Twitter.
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:24.100]  I think Facebook is a real problem.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.900]  But I will give Zuckerberg credit
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.660]  for having a coherent strategy for dealing with this.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.580]  And when they finally pulled the trigger,
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.700]  they just pulled the trigger.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:35.740]  The way that Twitter gave him a 12-hour timeout
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:38.540]  and temporarily banned it, and then the next.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.860]  That was disgraceful.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.500]  It just was so incoherent.
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:45.060]  That, to me, had to be the precipitating moment
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.540]  where the executives went to Jack and said,
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.060]  Jack, how in the world can we end a 12-hour timeout?
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:54.220]  This can't be, you know.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.180]  Well, I wouldn't be sure they were all executives, either.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.020]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.700]  I would like to, you know what, there was,
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.020]  I don't wanna know.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.600]  I don't wanna know, because honestly,
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.960]  if we were to find out now,
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.780]  I think some of those people might be in danger.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:07.620]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.480]  Well, there was a letter, you know,
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.020]  that rank-and-file employees sent.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.220]  I did hear about the letter.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:19.220]  And I believe the letter was before the 12-hour timeout.
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.700]  I could be wrong there.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:21.620]  I forget, too.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.300]  Yeah, but I mean, remember, they let him back on
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.340]  after the 12-hour timeout.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:31.900]  And at that point, every other platform
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.660]  was already booting him permanently.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.060]  It's just a very strange response, you know.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.260]  I mean, it's like.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.960]  Not if you know anything about addiction.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.740]  Yeah, that's the best analogy I can think of.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.980]  It's true.
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.120]  Jack Dorsey is addicted to Donald Trump,
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.900]  as much as Donald Trump is addicted to tweeting.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.700]  And it was, it was like a bargaining maneuver, right?
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:02.300]  Okay, 12 hours of shutout.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.580]  Not just you can't post,
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.080]  but we're gonna disable the account for 12 hours.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.460]  You know, it's.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.300]  Oh, I can do it.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.860]  I can go 12 hours.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.100]  I can go 12 hours.
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:12.080]  Yeah.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.340]  We've all heard this.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.400]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.020]  I can go 12 hours.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:18.300]  It's not a problem.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.740]  Anyway, to better times ahead.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.340]  Thanks, Mike.
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:26.340]  To better times ahead.
