[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Oh yeah, I love it. I love that beat. Go ahead. God, this is going to be a nightmare to edit.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  Sorry, Caleb.
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.800]  Good thing neither of us are editing the show. Paul Kefasis is back on the show, co-founder
[00:25.800 --> 00:28.980]  of Rokumiba Software. Paul, you've been on the show many times. I don't think you've
[00:28.980 --> 00:31.880]  been on in quite some time.
[00:31.880 --> 00:36.280]  I think I was on some kind of a list. I'm not sure what I did. I didn't rip up a picture
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.680]  of the Pope or anything, but I don't know what I did, but I'm back.
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.520]  All right, let me see here. I've got a list of former guests. This is episode 214. You
[00:46.520 --> 00:51.440]  were just on. You were on episode 112.
[00:51.440 --> 00:54.280]  We should have waited 10 more episodes. We could have doubled the number.
[00:54.280 --> 00:57.040]  Or we should have done it two episodes ago and made it a centennial.
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.040]  Oh, there you go.
[00:59.040 --> 01:04.560]  I don't know. Well, I don't know what took so long. I will have to speak to the scheduler,
[01:04.560 --> 01:08.360]  but it is good to have you back. It's not a complete coincidence. We're celebrating
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.200]  the release of a new Rokumiba app, Farago. Am I pronouncing that correctly?
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.200]  You are.
[01:14.200 --> 01:15.200]  F-A-R-R-A-G-O.
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.560]  That's right.
[01:19.560 --> 01:20.960]  And where does the name come from?
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.080]  Well, it's actually a word that means, it's a word that nobody knows. It's an English
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.980]  word that means basically sort of a melange or a jumble or, you know, just an assortment
[01:30.980 --> 01:36.120]  of things. We were, you know, toying around with a whole bunch of different names as I'm
[01:36.120 --> 01:40.700]  sure anyone who's named anything has experience with you. You try everything.
[01:40.700 --> 01:45.520]  The Mac OS X dictionary says it's a confused mixture.
[01:45.520 --> 01:50.800]  Yeah, it's got slightly negative connotations, so it's not quite like, you know, a medley,
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.400]  but most people don't know the word, so we're hoping to get away with it.
[01:54.400 --> 01:58.800]  All right. And the app, it's a Mac app that is a soundboard app. And if you don't know
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.520]  what a soundboard app is, a soundboard app is. That's my handing it off to you.
[02:03.520 --> 02:11.620]  Oh, I mean, it's the perfect thing for, you know, just basically if you want any sort
[02:11.620 --> 02:16.240]  of audio effects in your audio, you're recording a podcast and you just want to have some great
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.640]  sound effects like.
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.800]  I really think this is just what my show needs. I do.
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.920]  I think you I think you need to get 10 times as many sound effects as you have now. And
[02:29.920 --> 02:31.920]  that's really going to draw the listeners in.
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.760]  I think it'll greatly, greatly reduce the complaints about the speed at which I speak
[02:37.760 --> 02:44.400]  and the number of times I pause before speaking. Marco, if you can talk on sound effects anytime
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.920]  you need a break. Yeah, I've long suspected that Marco added that smart speed thing just
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.760]  just for my show for you solely for you. Right. It should be like the talk show.
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.960]  The Gruber filter. Just take out the long pauses and now we now we can fill them with
[02:58.960 --> 03:05.440]  farts. Absolutely. Well, so so we were talking about this before the show and I pulled up,
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.000]  you know, half a dozen couple dozen different audio effects to fiddle around with. So I
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.520]  got to figure out how to sprinkle them in lightly. I don't want to go too nuts with
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.400]  it. Right. But the idea here is is not just that you can play sounds at any point, but
[03:19.400 --> 03:25.080]  you you've obviously, as everybody listening can can hear, you've piped it into the audio
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.360]  pipeline that you're recording. You know, it's, you know, and that's that we could talk
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.200]  about that just for people who aren't familiar, some of the other apps were Amoeba has that's
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.840]  right up your alley. But then, you know, so at a technical level, you've got to understand
[03:40.840 --> 03:46.440]  the way sound works on a Mac. But I think more importantly is that it has a gorgeous
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.760]  user interface. Effectively, I, you know, correct me if you if you think, you know,
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.880]  you've obviously put tons of thought in this, and I've put about five minutes into like
[03:55.880 --> 04:04.120]  looking at it and saying cool. But in effect, it is sort of like a user interface design
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.560]  app for people who need to play sounds at a moment's notice. So you can arrange, you
[04:09.560 --> 04:15.280]  know, pick the sounds you need, arrange them in the way you want them to be or that makes
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.760]  logical sense to you, maybe not to anybody else. But you can pick this logical order
[04:19.760 --> 04:25.880]  and you have a big visual interface and you can color code the sounds by category or whatever.
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.780]  And you've got these big click targets. So it's you know, you don't it's not like a little
[04:29.780 --> 04:33.240]  tiny thing you have to add. So if you really want to play a sound right away, it's it's
[04:33.240 --> 04:37.040]  got a big Fitz's law target as they would say.
[04:37.040 --> 04:43.480]  Yeah, and also the way we sort of anticipate people using it is via the keyboard. So everything's
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.960]  mapped right to your keyboard. So it sort of turns your keyboard into a basically like
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.000]  a sample machine, right? So if you're if you're looking at the visual on screen, and you say,
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.200]  okay, you know, I know what I need, and you can see what key you need to hit right away.
[04:55.200 --> 04:59.600]  So that's, it's certainly playable via the mouse, but the keyboard is really the sort
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.220]  of the primary way to use it, I think.
[05:01.220 --> 05:08.040]  And by default, like when you first like first run the app does F map to fart?
[05:08.040 --> 05:13.360]  Our sample set actually does not have a fart sound in it. I had to download that separately.
[05:13.360 --> 05:22.160]  You know, we've got we've got the the, you know, we've got all sorts that we we came
[05:22.160 --> 05:27.920]  up with, I'm trying to look at our sample set, I think it's 25 sounds. And we were scouring
[05:27.920 --> 05:31.920]  the internet to find good sounds and to find things that we wanted. And some of the feedback
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.200]  I got after the app was released about probably about a dozen different people said, Oh, this
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.240]  is great. It just needs, you know, sound and it's like fart noise it needs. It needs a
[05:40.240 --> 05:46.240]  toilet flush. So really, we need another sample pack of like the really goofy or juvenile
[05:46.240 --> 05:49.120]  noises that we did not include in the first go round.
[05:49.120 --> 05:56.600]  I had I had a I had a brainstorm and as usual, it came way too late. We started recording
[05:56.600 --> 06:01.160]  roughly an hour and 20 minutes after I told you we would be starting to record. I had
[06:01.160 --> 06:06.720]  a true I had an eye doctor appointment that ran late. And various other shenanigans going
[06:06.720 --> 06:11.320]  on here in the city of Philadelphia, which we will get to in a bit. And of course, so
[06:11.320 --> 06:15.840]  an hour and 20 minutes after we were set to record as I come down to the podcast cave,
[06:15.840 --> 06:21.580]  shuffling my various beverages and trying not to trip and fall. I suddenly realized
[06:21.580 --> 06:27.640]  what we should have loaded the soundboard up with. And it's it's clips of my wife laughing
[06:27.640 --> 06:32.480]  on just the tip. And then we could we could have made it sound as though she was here
[06:32.480 --> 06:38.440]  with us and just loving what part of the episode No, just but all just loving what we're saying
[06:38.440 --> 06:43.200]  just dying of laughter every step of the way, which probably would have hated that it would
[06:43.200 --> 06:48.840]  have been perfect would have driven her nuts. Because I mean, when she listens to the show,
[06:48.840 --> 06:54.960]  all she hears is
[06:54.960 --> 06:58.280]  if you could make her look a fool, that'd be pretty good. Yeah, that would have been
[06:58.280 --> 07:05.480]  pretty good. Anyway, as usual, dollars a day late and a dollar short.
[07:05.480 --> 07:11.560]  For I go for I go for I go for I go came out two weeks ago, right? Two weeks ago today,
[07:11.560 --> 07:14.560]  actually. How's it doing?
[07:14.560 --> 07:21.640]  I haven't bought a boat yet. So if the listeners are intrigued, get get your 1000 copies and
[07:21.640 --> 07:26.400]  all right, then I can each and then I can get my boat. I know the answer to this question
[07:26.400 --> 07:32.360]  but I'm going to ask it as though I don't direct download direct purchase Mac App Store
[07:32.360 --> 07:39.240]  or both direct download for free trial as with all of our software direct purchase from
[07:39.240 --> 07:44.280]  our store and this app actually could potentially be in the Mac App Store but it is not in the
[07:44.280 --> 07:48.600]  Mac App Store. I mean, I don't know how deep you want to get into this but we've we've
[07:48.600 --> 07:54.080]  had two applications in the Mac App Store and we pulled one of them out because the
[07:54.080 --> 07:58.080]  changes that they made in terms of the rules in the Mac App Store made it not viable to
[07:58.080 --> 08:03.640]  stay there. And that remaining app that app was piezo, right? Yep. So that was that's
[08:03.640 --> 08:07.680]  our simple audio recorder, which is actually the recorder that I'm using right now because
[08:07.680 --> 08:14.400]  my version of audio hijack was all the let's just call it messed up. So that was in the
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.600]  Mac App Store specifically to make it possible to have a recorder that was that skirted the
[08:20.600 --> 08:26.680]  sorry that followed the rules of Mac App Store. And then those rules changed. And so we eventually
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.360]  had to pull it out because the app was not able to be updated. So we said, Alright, we'd
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.240]  rather have a functioning app, a properly functioning app that is available directly
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.960]  than a crippled app that is also in the Mac App Store. That's a similar it's a similar
[08:41.960 --> 08:48.860]  story to our good friends at panic, right with, I believe with Coda, their code editor
[08:48.860 --> 08:56.920]  with remote file connection file serving connection stuff effectively had to be pulled at one
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.280]  point from that Mac App Store even though it's it's an acclaimed app. It's an FTP and
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.480]  a web editor. I mean, like, you wouldn't think this sort of thing would run afoul of App
[09:07.480 --> 09:13.840]  Store rules. But here we are. But you've written publicly, I believe about piezos success after
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.040]  being just going direct download direct sale only, right? Yeah, absolutely. So I actually
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.240]  just just this afternoon, we posted a review of last year, 2017. And I was rereading that
[09:25.240 --> 09:28.120]  the post that you're referring to, it was a post from February of last year, just about
[09:28.120 --> 09:32.680]  a year ago. And two years ago is when we pulled piezo out of the Mac App Store. And so after
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.920]  a year, I compared our revenue from the year what the last year when it was in the Mac
[09:37.920 --> 09:41.840]  App Store, and the first year when it was no longer in the Mac App Store. And the result
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.840]  was that we actually earned more revenue, because our sales were our raw unit sales
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.560]  were slightly down. But the difference was not so great that we didn't earn more revenue
[09:52.560 --> 09:58.840]  because Apple takes 30% of every sale that you get in the Mac App Store. And he when
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.000]  we sell it directly, we're getting somewhere around 95% of the revenue. So it's not terribly
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.560]  difficult to with to make more money. Even if you have slightly lower sales, you're probably
[10:09.560 --> 10:16.640]  gonna earn more money on those sales. So and as you're where we are, as usual, many caveats
[10:16.640 --> 10:26.720]  apply that the rules for games might be entirely different than for utilities like piezo. But
[10:26.720 --> 10:33.440]  the bottom line is that the Mac App Store, wherever it is on the scale of zero to 100
[10:33.440 --> 10:40.560]  as a success for the Mac development community, it is absolutely I think I can't I think it's
[10:40.560 --> 10:50.680]  undeniably not at the point where it is eating the non Mac App Store market, if anything,
[10:50.680 --> 10:54.440]  the non Mac App Store market is as strong as ever, like,
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.960]  well, and I think has has started to eat some of the App Store. Because you mentioned you
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.000]  mentioned panic, and we pulled an app out. And you know, I'd have to look back. But there's,
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.560]  you can probably find a good dozen fairly major apps, the app store that right, that
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.080]  that then left exactly just like that.
[11:12.080 --> 11:13.080]  Right.
[11:13.080 --> 11:20.680]  I should try to find it. Rich Segal, founder of BB co founder of BB edit, bear bound software,
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.760]  had a great talk at Singleton. But God is Max Q talk. Yeah, yeah. But Singleton, how
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.120]  many years ago is that? Geez? I think it's probably about three or four, at least. So
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.380]  it's not even that recent. And it was a great talk. Because effectively, it was like a half
[11:36.380 --> 11:41.000]  hour talk about why he took BB edit out of the Mac App Store and went back to direct
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.120]  downloads. And I don't even want to try to summarize it. Because what made it such a
[11:46.120 --> 11:50.120]  great talk was it really did take half an hour for him to make his point.
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.200]  Right, right. You know, I won't I won't summarize it either. But it's right. I'm sure you can
[11:55.200 --> 11:58.840]  find a link. And it's definitely worth a watch if you're at all interested in the Mac App
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.000]  Store or leaving the Mac App Store, right. But if anything, peak Mac App Store was early
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.720]  on in the days of App Store. And one of the fears a lot of us had was that if man if the
[12:08.720 --> 12:17.600]  Mac App Store really takes off, and and Mac users just abandon direct downloads and outside
[12:17.600 --> 12:23.300]  the Mac App Store payments and only buy stuff from the App Store, it really it's it's not
[12:23.300 --> 12:29.160]  about the 30% or certainly not only about the 30%. But it's just about, boy, would that
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.880]  make people whose livelihood depends on selling independent Mac App Store feel uncomfortable
[12:33.880 --> 12:41.040]  about having their entire livelihood in a store that is clearly never going to be better
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.640]  than the second favorite in Apple.
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.580]  Right, absolutely. Yeah, the the iOS App Store is clearly what they're focused on. And the
[12:48.580 --> 12:52.680]  Mac App Store sort of seemed like, hey, we did this on the phone. So we might as well
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.780]  try it on the Mac. And I think you made a great point that let's see, I think it's been
[12:57.780 --> 13:02.920]  I want it was it 2010 or 2011 that the Mac App Store came out. I don't want to I don't
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.560]  want to screw it up. It was a route. It was one of those two. I'm fairly certain. But
[13:06.560 --> 13:09.560]  it was quite a while ago at this point. And when it came out, everyone said, Okay, let's
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.040]  get in there. You know, the iOS App Store has been such such a success. Let's get in
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.520]  there. And this will get our app in front of everyone. And and I think a lot of apps
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.400]  did get in there. And then over time realized, you know what, this isn't doing a whole lot
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.000]  for us. And it's taking a decent chunk of our both our money and our energy. And that's
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.580]  when you've seen apps sort of peel back. And like you said, the peak was was early on.
[13:33.580 --> 13:39.620]  And I think since then, it's been fairly slow. And there certainly hasn't been any major
[13:39.620 --> 13:44.800]  app that I've seen that has only been in the Mac App Store.
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.600]  Is Pixelmator Mac App Store only? Ooh, that's a good question. That's it's
[13:49.600 --> 13:54.800]  certainly possible. But I would bet that they focus on the Mac App Store but still have
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.820]  a direct download. Anyway, your memory is excellent. The Mac App Store was announced
[13:58.820 --> 14:05.520]  at Apple's back to the Mac event October 20 2010. That was the episode that was the on
[14:05.520 --> 14:11.120]  the event where I believe Craig Federighi first appeared on stage and he had a sort
[14:11.120 --> 14:17.200]  of a shaky, shaky demo. He's gotten much he's gotten much better
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.120]  at the at the on stage performances. Yeah, the the backstory behind that wasn't
[14:24.120 --> 14:29.720]  really so much that he was nervous but that there was like a last minute software change
[14:29.720 --> 14:32.960]  and he realized that it didn't work the way they thought it was sort of like, you know,
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.120]  like the rule like don't change anything in between rehearsals and demo. And it was like,
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.560]  they thought, well, we can change that. And he realized on stage that we shouldn't have
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.600]  changed that. Anyway, he has gotten a little. I mean, he went from being like, wow, why
[14:46.600 --> 14:53.760]  did they put him on stage to? Wow, he should be on TV. Right. Anyway, October 20 2010 was
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.240]  when it was announced, they began taking submissions in November 2010. And then it launched in
[14:59.240 --> 15:05.420]  January 2011. So your 2010 2011 confusion was actually more accurate than picking one
[15:05.420 --> 15:10.520]  or the other. Yeah, and and you're right. I was just looking at pixelmator Pro is it
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.480]  looks like only in the Mac App Store. So that is that is certainly one that is sort of the
[15:15.480 --> 15:20.720]  exception that proves the rule maybe. Well, it's a complicated story. I think sketches
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.880]  in there. I don't think sketches only Mac App Store, but it is definitely not sketch
[15:25.880 --> 15:31.120]  definitely isn't. Yeah, it Well, it's, it's worked out in a weird way. I don't want to
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.360]  spend too much time on the Mac App Store here. But it just seems like, gosh, now we're seven
[15:36.360 --> 15:43.480]  years in, and seven years in it. It's sort of like a, like a nowhere, you know, like,
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.240]  it's not a failure. But it is absolutely not put a dent in not independent or not a big
[15:49.240 --> 15:56.560]  success. Right? It's just sort of weird. I don't know. I don't want to, you know, I'm
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.000]  not, I just looked at that one to sketch actually, is one of the ones that left the store. Oh,
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.120]  that's right. That's right. That's right. They're one of the fairly large ones that
[16:04.120 --> 16:08.480]  left. That's right. Because they wanted to, they wanted to switch to a subscription model
[16:08.480 --> 16:14.160]  that the App Store doesn't really support, or something. Exactly. Right. Yeah, that's
[16:14.160 --> 16:17.880]  right. That's right. That's why I knew that sketch was on the, there was something about
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.120]  it. Exactly. Something about it. Well, so that so that all this is sort of tangential
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.440]  to what you originally asked. And you know, Ferrago is something that fits within the
[16:28.440 --> 16:34.760]  confines of the App Store, at least currently. But for for us as a developer, as developers,
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.680]  it has not been a priority to get it there. And I was looking back at a post from several
[16:40.680 --> 16:43.600]  years ago, and somebody was saying, Oh, you know, this isn't in the Mac App Store, you
[16:43.600 --> 16:46.920]  know, no one's gonna buy it, or I'm not gonna buy it. And you're you're crazy. This is where
[16:46.920 --> 16:52.400]  this is where the puck is going, etc. And it was pretty amusing to read, because, you
[16:52.400 --> 16:56.420]  know, that's not the way that it's worked out. And fortunately, for us, we've been able
[16:56.420 --> 17:00.440]  to continue selling this stuff directly there. I mean, there's a part of it, I you know,
[17:00.440 --> 17:08.400]  I've been in the the racket, as they say, and I understand the the when you're on the
[17:08.400 --> 17:14.000]  side where Apple's taking 30% from the price you set for the app you made it, you know,
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.900]  it feels a little high. But I totally understand from the user's point of view, because I personally
[17:20.900 --> 17:25.660]  still enjoy buying buying apps from Mac App Store. Because I love the simplicity of knowing
[17:25.660 --> 17:29.440]  like, if I bought it from the Mac App Store, there's one place to go to re download it
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.200]  on a different machine. Or, you know, you know what I mean? There's just one central
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.400]  place to to to check for that. And that is very convenient. And I do trust it, you know,
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.240]  and I know I'm not going to get spam from the developer afterwards, right? Not that
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.960]  I buy a lot of apps that I suspect I'm going to get spam from the developer for but I understand
[17:47.960 --> 17:48.960]  the convenience of it. But
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.580]  no, absolutely. And it's certainly something where it's not something we shied away from.
[17:54.580 --> 17:58.960]  And you know, we've mentioned that 30% a bunch that that was never a sole reason to avoid
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.280]  it or anything like that. It's a it's a high number, but it's not so high that you'd say,
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.800]  Well, the heck with that, right. But that coupled with, you know, a half dozen other
[18:06.800 --> 18:10.760]  issues that you face as developer makes it a whole lot less appealing right now. And
[18:10.760 --> 18:16.120]  it's not something where like iOS, you have to be there to get to users. So yeah, fortunately,
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.120]  we can avoid it.
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.880]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. You're never going to believe
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.720]  who it is. It is our good friend. It's the Mac App Store. It's the Mac App Store. Squarespace.
[18:26.720 --> 18:32.320]  Look, it's the new year. It still counts as New Year in early February. And if you people
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.640]  add, you know, I think it's cliche that people make resolutions and they're setting out to
[18:36.640 --> 18:40.840]  do new things. But I think it's true. I think it's absolutely true that it's you know, the
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.960]  wintertime is the time you reflect you think, hey, I want to set out I've got this project
[18:43.960 --> 18:49.580]  I've always been wanting to make something like that. Or you want to redo like a website
[18:49.580 --> 18:58.320]  you already have. Squarespace is a fantastic platform to go try it out on. First, it's
[18:58.320 --> 19:06.320]  terrific. Second, it has unbelievable design features. And third, it they do it all they
[19:06.320 --> 19:16.240]  do the hosting, they do the do you could do domain registration there. They have their
[19:16.240 --> 19:24.000]  own stats and analytics package. And I've seen it and the presentation is so good because
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.080]  it's not just about like with analytics. It's not just like, do you have all this XYZ information?
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.480]  It's how is it presented to you? Is it like does it make any sense? I'll tell you the
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.320]  truth. I still use Google Analytics during fireball. I honestly don't understand how
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.320]  to use it. I've been using it for like seven years and I go in there and I honest to God
[19:43.320 --> 19:47.560]  feel like I'm reading Greek or something like that. It's terrible. Everything at Squarespace
[19:47.560 --> 19:55.720]  is so easy. It is so clearly made from a company that values good design every step of the
[19:55.720 --> 20:00.640]  way, not just in terms of you having a good website that looks well designed, but that
[20:00.640 --> 20:06.720]  everything when your billing interface is well designed, your back end stats interface
[20:06.720 --> 20:13.200]  is well designed. It's just so clear sometimes when a company only values design at the very
[20:13.200 --> 20:19.440]  very front end customer facing part of their business and they don't care about it at the
[20:19.440 --> 20:24.520]  rest of the way down the line. Squarespace is a company that is all about design, really

[21:14.440 --> 21:18.040]  I've got some follow up. I've got some important follow up from last week's episode,
[21:18.040 --> 21:27.600]  episode 213 with John Moltz who hadn't been on for a long time either. I mentioned,
[21:27.600 --> 21:30.820]  there was a podcast a few years back. Do you remember the show Paul? It was called You
[21:30.820 --> 21:38.280]  Look Nice Today. It's a show I figured you would be. It's a show that was actually,
[21:38.280 --> 21:43.720]  this is actually, people don't know this, it was actually the first podcast. These three
[21:43.720 --> 21:53.960]  lads invented podcasting a little over 10 years ago featuring Scott Simpson, Merlin
[21:53.960 --> 22:00.960]  Mann and Adam Lonely Sandwich, Lisa Gore. All three of whom have been on this show,
[22:00.960 --> 22:06.000]  I think a few times including Scott who happens to have been on a very special episode of
[22:06.000 --> 22:14.180]  this show that was recorded with you. It was me, you and Scott Simpson.
[22:14.180 --> 22:17.620]  The Velocity Hotels episode. That was the Velocity Hotels episode. We came
[22:17.620 --> 22:21.920]  up with the idea. It was a fantastic idea that we never really followed up on but we
[22:21.920 --> 22:27.840]  are now has been stolen. I have lawyers working on this but I don't know if we're going
[22:27.840 --> 22:30.720]  to see any money out of it. The idea if you don't remember this in the
[22:30.720 --> 22:39.900]  Velocity Hotels episode is that we came up with the idea that why are hotels only fixed
[22:39.900 --> 22:44.200]  in fixed locations and what if you're on a trip and you need to get from point A to
[22:44.200 --> 22:49.760]  point B. We stay in a hotel at point A, you get a good night's sleep, you wake up and
[22:49.760 --> 22:55.280]  then you still got to get to point B. Well, what if your hotel could be a bus, a large
[22:55.280 --> 23:01.040]  motor coach perhaps but not like you're sleeping on like a greyhound and just reclining
[23:01.040 --> 23:05.540]  in a chair. You'd get a nice little luxury seat sort of like those first class cabins
[23:05.540 --> 23:06.540]  on Emirates.
[23:06.540 --> 23:08.440]  Oh yeah, like a light flat bed.
[23:08.440 --> 23:13.280]  Yeah and maybe there's a lobby bar in the back of the bus so before you tuck in, you
[23:13.280 --> 23:20.360]  could have a nightcap. It was a fantastic idea and the truth is as you've pointed
[23:20.360 --> 23:24.040]  out that there are some competitors. While we've been sitting on the idea, some competitors
[23:24.040 --> 23:29.880]  have come out and do we have lawyers on this?
[23:29.880 --> 23:36.040]  I do. I don't know exactly what they're doing. I got laughed at kind of a lot so
[23:36.040 --> 23:40.900]  it's not clear if that was laughter as they're going to take these people to the cleaners
[23:40.900 --> 23:43.720]  or I hope that's what it was.
[23:43.720 --> 23:48.480]  Well anyway, while John Moltz was telling a story on the show last week about how he
[23:48.480 --> 23:53.680]  does not enjoy cherries but he does enjoy cherries when they are soaked in bourbon and
[23:53.680 --> 24:00.320]  put into a cocktail which does sound good and I asked him just for specificity even
[24:00.320 --> 24:04.160]  though I kind of knew the answer. I suspected that he was talking about regular cherries.
[24:04.160 --> 24:08.680]  I wanted to make sure he didn't mean maraschino cherries which are often used as a garnish
[24:08.680 --> 24:13.600]  in cocktails and he said no regular and that reminded me of an episode of You Look Nice
[24:13.600 --> 24:20.200]  Today and I brought it up where the lads on You Look Nice Today were talking about a cocktail
[24:20.200 --> 24:25.960]  they invented just for the listeners of the show and I conflated two cocktails unfortunately
[24:25.960 --> 24:31.140]  and that's what I need to follow up. I said it was called the Aunt Nancy like your dad's
[24:31.140 --> 24:41.080]  sister Nancy, the Aunt Nancy and that involved a fistful of maraschino cherries, ice and
[24:41.080 --> 24:47.560]  top it off with Maker's Mark. Turns out that's not the Aunt Nancy. That was from a later
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.880]  episode of You Look Nice Today. That drink was called, they called the Shirley Temple
[24:51.880 --> 24:52.880]  of Doom.
[24:52.880 --> 24:55.480]  I think there's some ginger ale in that, is there not?
[24:55.480 --> 24:58.000]  Nope, that's the Aunt Nancy. The Aunt Nancy.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.440]  Oh is that, okay this is why you conflated it, I see.
[25:00.440 --> 25:05.240]  Right, this is why I conflated it. The Aunt Nancy in fact and I will put this link in
[25:05.240 --> 25:11.000]  the show notes, there's a gentleman who runs a You Look Nice Today index where he went
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.960]  back and re-listened to their episodes and index topics. Unfortunately the Aunt Nancy,
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.080]  I happened to re-listen to the episode on the HomePod I've got upstairs as a matter
[25:22.080 --> 25:24.240]  of fact.
[25:24.240 --> 25:25.240]  It was.
[25:25.240 --> 25:28.160]  I also gave it a listen because it was better than anything else that was going on.
[25:28.160 --> 25:35.320]  It was ambiguously defined in the episode. But as best as anybody can determine, the
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.920]  Aunt Nancy is ginger ale and Maker's Mark served with lots of cherries.
[25:40.920 --> 25:41.920]  But also.
[25:41.920 --> 25:50.160]  A plastic drink sword. You know those little swords they use to spear a garnish? So on
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.680]  one of those you put a buffalo chicken wing pre-dipped in ranch dressing and then a second
[25:56.680 --> 26:04.640]  sword kebab with eight, spearing eight mentos. And then you put that together and there you
[26:04.640 --> 26:09.400]  got it. That's the best definition anybody has of an Aunt Nancy. The only required elements,
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.360]  this is sort of like when you're talking about like an old-fashioned and you know there's
[26:13.360 --> 26:15.480]  bourbon or rye.
[26:15.480 --> 26:17.300]  Twenty different variations on it.
[26:17.300 --> 26:21.840]  Sugar and bitters. But then other variations on the old-fashioned, some will include a
[26:21.840 --> 26:28.160]  muddled up orange or cherry or something like that. The required parts are not the ginger
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.780]  ale or the Maker's Mark. It's just now it's just the speared buffalo chicken wing pre-dipped
[26:33.780 --> 26:38.760]  in ranch dressing and the second sword of eight mentos. And you could pretty much mix
[26:38.760 --> 26:43.880]  that with any alcohol that you wanted to and I think you could still call it an Aunt Nancy.
[26:43.880 --> 26:48.920]  And I also believe there's there's some ambiguity about whether you can also substitute a chicken
[26:48.920 --> 26:49.920]  tender.
[26:49.920 --> 26:55.920]  Right, there is definitely ambiguity about chicken finger versus chicken wing. And while
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.800]  I was listening to this I had to raise a couple objections because my parents are from Buffalo
[27:00.800 --> 27:04.660]  and they would roundly chastise me for not pointing out that it's a chicken wing. It's
[27:04.660 --> 27:12.360]  not a buffalo wing. So it's the Philly cheesesteak kind of thing. But you know my mom always
[27:12.360 --> 27:17.120]  makes sure to point out that buffaloes do not have wings in case anyone is confused.
[27:17.120 --> 27:23.440]  And ranch dressing is all wrong. It's blue cheese or it's nothing. And then the third
[27:23.440 --> 27:32.200]  issue is I don't think you can spear mentos. Mentos have a hard shell. So this is a 10
[27:32.200 --> 27:41.480]  year old episode of a mildly popular podcast. But we are doing some deep cut and critiquing
[27:41.480 --> 27:42.480]  of it.
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.160]  Stirring up some significant controversy.
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.880]  Absolutely. But I do I do want to praise them because in the episode, there was a reference
[27:50.880 --> 28:00.040]  to a domain butthole video.com which a decade later, almost one full decade later still
[28:00.040 --> 28:08.120]  leads to this episode, which is just video.com butthole video.com. You know, click that and
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.800]  it will take you directly to this episode.
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.920]  I'll bet you 10 bucks Merlin registered the domain Merlin is a domain hoarder. And he's
[28:15.920 --> 28:22.040]  also very good at it. If by good you mean actually keeps them and keeps paying for them
[28:22.040 --> 28:28.000]  perhaps for forever by by some people's definitions, the people who are good at domains are the
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.740]  ones who forget the ones they've never used and stopped paying for them. But
[28:32.740 --> 28:38.820]  I was gonna say I bought velocity hotels.com for that episode that we did. And I checked
[28:38.820 --> 28:43.680]  it and I have not been paying for it. So I guess it's a question of whether or not I'm
[28:43.680 --> 28:50.240]  good at it, but I have kept the 30 or $40 that I would have been paying. So I my wallet
[28:50.240 --> 28:51.940]  thanks me.
[28:51.940 --> 28:57.580]  So in the show notes for this episode, do I just leave butthole video.com as an item
[28:57.580 --> 29:06.680]  in the list of links without any explanation? I think I must no context. No context. I also
[29:06.680 --> 29:14.080]  in a minor correction on the Shirley Temple of Doom is that I believe the official definition
[29:14.080 --> 29:22.120]  is not a fistful of maraschino cherries, but instead a shitload of maraschino cherries.
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.260]  It's sort of like mixing up teaspoons and tablespoons. So you don't want to get the
[29:26.260 --> 29:30.640]  wrong proportion. You want a shitload of maraschino cherries and maker's mark and I guess some
[29:30.640 --> 29:35.800]  ice and that's it. And and that is that is the drink I have in fact seen Scott Simpson
[29:35.800 --> 29:41.800]  order several times. Oh, frequently, but I'm looking at Merlin's picture of a Shirley Temple
[29:41.800 --> 29:45.440]  of Doom and there is ginger ale. So I think the Shirley Temple of Doom and the Aunt Nancy
[29:45.440 --> 29:52.960]  are remarkably similar, save for the speared meats and candies. Yeah, I and then I actually
[29:52.960 --> 29:58.920]  was trying to Google this and it's actually impossible to to Google you can get to the
[29:58.920 --> 30:04.320]  Aunt Nancy, even though usually most of the Google like Aunt Nancy recipe and it's seriously
[30:04.320 --> 30:12.680]  like somebody's Aunt Nancy's like recipe for pumpkin pie. And there's absolutely no. There
[30:12.680 --> 30:17.760]  are no Mentos involved. Oh, and I should also mention for those of you who are curious about
[30:17.760 --> 30:25.200]  the the chicken wing garnish that what that their their idea for that is is not necessarily
[30:25.200 --> 30:29.960]  that it's a flavor enhancer for the cocktail. It's something that while like a mixed crowd
[30:29.960 --> 30:36.080]  of adults and children, right as a distraction, right that you could, you know, if mommy needs
[30:36.080 --> 30:39.960]  a moment, you know, mommy needs a drink, she can order an Aunt Nancy and then take the
[30:39.960 --> 30:44.080]  chicken wing out and hand it to little Joey and he'll have something to, you know, keep
[30:44.080 --> 30:51.520]  them quiet. Anyway, which I think is a genius idea, quite frankly. Here's my point. If you
[30:51.520 --> 30:56.480]  Google Shirley Temple of Doom, there's a ton of people who've come up with it's too, too
[30:56.480 --> 31:01.000]  obvious a name. There are, you know, the pun, I don't recall that when you connect Temple
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.560]  of Doom with Shirley Temple, and you Google it and there's actually a an entire slew of
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.240]  people who've used this name to define a cocktail and the cocktail nut they bear no similarity
[31:10.240 --> 31:14.160]  whatsoever. They're just people who thought of the name. Whereas the Aunt Nancy to me
[31:14.160 --> 31:19.080]  is a genius name for a cocktail. And I kind of feel like I kind of feel like it's up to
[31:19.080 --> 31:25.440]  me and you Paul to sort of I kind of feel like this this definition in the guy's index
[31:25.440 --> 31:28.960]  of you look nice today ought to become the official and Nancy let's let's combine them
[31:28.960 --> 31:35.240]  together. We'll have ginger ale maker's mark. I would just go with a splash of ginger ale.
[31:35.240 --> 31:39.560]  Frankly, I don't want to put a lot of ginger ale on a drink. Mostly maker's mark is what
[31:39.560 --> 31:48.760]  we want. Yeah, splash of ginger ale. maker's mark a shitload of cherries, a kebab with
[31:48.760 --> 31:55.520]  a buffalo chicken wing or small chicken finger. Now, do you want to do you think that we should
[31:55.520 --> 32:02.000]  say ranch dressing or blue cheese? I want to nix the ranch. I'm not all right, blue
[32:02.000 --> 32:08.080]  cheese or nothing. But remember, this is for children. And blue cheese is a pretty strong
[32:08.080 --> 32:16.280]  flavor for for children. You make a you make a good point. I'm gonna say we're making the
[32:16.280 --> 32:21.960]  cocktail for children. We can go with ranch. Let's just nix let's just nix the dressing.
[32:21.960 --> 32:25.720]  Let's just nix it as as you know, and then it can be as a required element dressing of
[32:25.720 --> 32:28.800]  your choice. You know what I mean? Like you can get a martini with a blue cheese stuffed
[32:28.800 --> 32:32.200]  olive and that's not necessarily canonical. But nobody would question that it's still
[32:32.200 --> 32:38.080]  a legitimate martini. It's just up to the right. And what do we do about the Mentos?
[32:38.080 --> 32:43.880]  I I really don't think you can spear Mentos with a plastic sword. And I I don't want to
[32:43.880 --> 32:47.880]  make that a requirement and then suddenly no one can make this drink. Is there a spearable
[32:47.880 --> 32:49.280]  candy?
[32:49.280 --> 32:56.600]  Oh, starbursts that have been sitting in your back pocket. Yeah, I don't think that's against
[32:56.600 --> 33:03.440]  I think I think that's gonna I think the bar is gonna lose their a rating. I think starbursts
[33:03.440 --> 33:09.320]  are legitimate. I think starbursts are a legitimate substitute. I hate to speak for the you look
[33:09.320 --> 33:12.920]  nice today boys because they're all good friends and I don't want to stomp on their intellectual
[33:12.920 --> 33:18.640]  property and I know that they have very good attorneys. But I think starbursts off the
[33:18.640 --> 33:24.880]  top of my head is a good idea. And I'll tell you what it adds. It adds a little bit of
[33:24.880 --> 33:30.600]  of chance to the drink because you don't know what flavor starbursts are going to get.
[33:30.600 --> 33:34.400]  And it's it's going to help the kids even more. You know, they get their they get their
[33:34.400 --> 33:37.320]  dinner and they get their chicken wing or chicken tender and then they get a little
[33:37.320 --> 33:40.960]  dessert. Yeah, I know they're going to be barking for those starbursts. But you got
[33:40.960 --> 33:46.320]  to tell them you know, not until you eat that chicken wing. I like it. Alright, I say we
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.960]  redefine it, see what the boys say, see if we can get an official get the and then you
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.480]  know, see if we can get this into some cocktail books, some cocktail books. Exactly. All right.
[33:56.480 --> 34:01.480]  All right. What else do we have to follow up? This one's nowhere near as fun. This one
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.480]  is so much nerdier. There's an app called nuzzle that Milton I talked about, which is
[34:06.480 --> 34:13.480]  an app that it's I really like it's you you let it have your Twitter, Twitter credentials,
[34:13.480 --> 34:18.320]  and then nuzzle keeps track of the people you follow. And that, you know, a threshold
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.080]  you can specify if four people that you follow in the last four hours have posted the same
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.220]  link, nuzzle will send you a notification of it. And then when it when you just want
[34:28.220 --> 34:33.720]  to see what's up, you can go and there's like a homepage where it maybe they haven't reached
[34:33.720 --> 34:39.040]  the point where they would have sent you a notification. But you can see a list of linked
[34:39.040 --> 34:45.280]  articles in order of how many people you follow have recently tweeted the link. And it's truly
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.320]  for me, at least the people I follow an interesting source of information, a way to find interesting
[34:50.320 --> 34:58.160]  breaking news. I said that they don't use the WebKit browser. Turns out they do. There's
[34:58.160 --> 35:05.680]  an option that you can turn on so that it does support the new SF Safari view controller,
[35:05.680 --> 35:13.280]  which is the in app browser that looks like Safari and supports content blockers and and
[35:13.280 --> 35:20.320]  stuff like that. You have to go to settings view stories with Safari, and in most cases,
[35:20.320 --> 35:23.800]  they'll use Safari view controller, but even then they don't use it all the time because
[35:23.800 --> 35:29.920]  they also have a view that includes a little dingus at the bottom that shows you which
[35:29.920 --> 35:34.920]  Twitter people you follow are the people who linked this that you can, you know, so you
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.960]  could see who are the people who linked this so that it's in your list and you can tap
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.740]  on them to see what their commentary was on the link to. And when they show that view,
[35:43.740 --> 35:48.560]  they still use the old web view that's kind of janky and shows a lot of ads. But anyway,
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.880]  that's that's, that's my follow up on this. There's a reason I don't do follow up most
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.160]  weeks. I just like that. And yet we've got three of them today, but the errors for this
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.680]  next one, I think is going to be very interesting to you. This seems like something that knowing
[36:00.680 --> 36:03.880]  you you're going to have strong opinions on this one, I might have let fly except I knew
[36:03.880 --> 36:07.480]  that with you on the show, we could have a good conversation about it. And this was that
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.400]  Molson I were talking about me complaining about a trip to the bank to deposit a check
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.720]  and I knew this, I knew this, but it kind of slipped my mind during the show because
[36:18.720 --> 36:26.860]  I can't help it. I try not to be too American centric, especially these days. But I knew
[36:26.860 --> 36:30.740]  this and it kind of slipped my mind, which is that and then maybe this is news to some
[36:30.740 --> 36:35.120]  of you who are Americans that the rest of the world, the rest of Western civilization
[36:35.120 --> 36:44.460]  moved away from checks as a means of conducting banking about 20 years ago. And so the idea
[36:44.460 --> 36:49.400]  that we still conduct business by checks, there were numerous listeners of the show
[36:49.400 --> 36:56.840]  who simply expressed like laughter like it's like finding out that in America they still
[36:56.840 --> 37:04.680]  don't have indoor plumbing. And that literally what I want to do, what I would like to be
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.840]  able to do is take a write myself a check and then take a picture of it and submit it
[37:09.840 --> 37:14.960]  through an app. So I don't have to go to the bank and effectively do it electronically.
[37:14.960 --> 37:21.300]  But even in that scenario, I'm, I still have to rip out a check a piece of paper and write
[37:21.300 --> 37:29.000]  it and sign it and then authorize it on the back just to do it. So that's what I was going
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.240]  to say is I've got I get I'd have to think about how many checks I get in here. It's
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.840]  not a lot. But I can do bill pay or you know, an online deposit of them by taking a picture
[37:38.840 --> 37:44.720]  with my phone. But this, the fact that I have to get this artifact in the first place, and
[37:44.720 --> 37:52.200]  then I digitize it with my, you know, $1,000 pocket computer, send it to the bank, right?
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.020]  I mean, that's, we're still we're still we're still dependent on this ridiculous piece of
[37:58.020 --> 38:05.040]  paper that has almost no security features. So what's the follow up on this, though? Just
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.840]  yeah, we're, we're backwards. And yeah, sorry. And it's embarrassing. It truly is. And it's
[38:09.840 --> 38:15.600]  just, but I don't you also think I just looking back on it, the idea of checks are absurd.
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.120]  I mean, at a certain point, all the concept of money, you know, we it's like, you know,
[38:19.120 --> 38:21.320]  we can, you don't want to think about it too much. You don't want to think about it too
[38:21.320 --> 38:31.880]  much. It's a collective shared illusion. But checks, in particular, just seem, it just
[38:31.880 --> 38:37.840]  seems crazy that when I was a kid, you know, half the time, when I'd go to the supermarket
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.240]  with my mom, you know, somebody, somebody in front of us was paying for the groceries
[38:42.240 --> 38:46.640]  with a check. And it was just, they would just let the person walk out of the store
[38:46.640 --> 38:52.400]  with $150 where the groceries with here, I put my name on this piece of paper. I'm good.
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.360]  Yep, you're good. But john, they they usually made him write a phone number on to their
[38:58.360 --> 39:03.880]  phone number, but a phone number. We're going to call this number that you wrote on here
[39:03.880 --> 39:12.960]  of this study problems with this check. It was kind of crazy. I mean, and it's just crazy
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.220]  now. Like, imagine if like one of these new payment systems came out, like Apple Pay came
[39:17.220 --> 39:26.740]  out and Eddy Q is up there on stage. He's like, we've got this is a great new system.
[39:26.740 --> 39:31.680]  You just type in how much you want in your your iPhone. And then you go down to the share
[39:31.680 --> 39:38.740]  menu and you hit print. Go to your go over to your printer. And now you've got an Apple
[39:38.740 --> 39:44.160]  Pay certificate. And you can take that to any store. And they're going to take it and
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.500]  they're going to file it away in a register. And they're going to take it to their nearest
[39:48.500 --> 39:55.800]  Apple store at their nearest convenience and will turn it into cash. Like it, the idea
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.800]  that there's paper involved in this is just nonsensical. It's crazy. So anyway, we understand
[40:01.800 --> 40:06.320]  what was the check you were depositing? It was just a payment, a partner payment from
[40:06.320 --> 40:12.120]  my daring firewall company to, you know, to me and Amy's personal account. So it was even
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.160]  your own money, your transferring money between your own accounts, and you still had to do
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.040]  it with a check. Well, and bottom line of this, and I've never a couple other people
[40:20.040 --> 40:23.260]  who commented on this one of them said, and the problem, we can't do the electronic thing
[40:23.260 --> 40:29.240]  because our personal checking has like a $500 limit on the checks that we can scan. So like
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.680]  relatives, you don't want to get too much money in your own account. Like a grandparent
[40:34.680 --> 40:40.500]  sends Jonas a check for his birthday or whatever, we can scan that. And it goes right into,
[40:40.500 --> 40:46.240]  you know, our account because, you know, we're not going to give the money to him. Of course,
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.760]  but any kind of serious like a, you know, anything that would count as a paycheck, you
[40:50.760 --> 40:53.880]  know, so over the limit, but a couple people have said that they had the same problem,
[40:53.880 --> 40:56.800]  but you just go to your bank and say, Hey, I want a higher limit on this, that they have
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.600]  a lot of discretion. I never tried that. It never occurs to me to try stuff like that.
[41:01.600 --> 41:05.600]  Like a bank tells me I'm, I don't know, I don't think I'm, you know, me, Paul, I'm not
[41:05.600 --> 41:12.160]  really like a strict toe the line rules follower. But I just assumed that when a bank's rule
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.600]  just seems like it doesn't, it doesn't seem negotiable. When a bank tells me you can deposit
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.840]  up to $500 I just think, well, that's a, that's a stupid rule. It doesn't even occur to me
[41:22.840 --> 41:24.480]  that you can't do it.
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.760]  Do you think we should be trying to negotiate like better interest rates?
[41:28.760 --> 41:29.760]  Yeah.
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.320]  Is that an option too?
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.560]  Can I do the same thing with my mortgage? Is that possible? Can I just go and say,
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.320]  I'm just not going to pay one month. So what are you going to do about it? Can we make
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.320]  this work?
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.000]  Well, what do you say I only pay in a month that I have 31 days? Because that seems like
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.760]  the full value of a month. I'll still pay the same number.
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.080]  Now I got a task for after the show. This is good. I'm going to call my bank, see what
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.080]  happens.
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.280]  Well, that's it for follow up. Anyway, checks are ridiculous. We know it and we don't know
[42:00.280 --> 42:03.480]  what to do about it. I'm sure Trump will get on it.
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.800]  We'll fix that right after we fix our healthcare system and our immigration system.
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.760]  And our elections being hijacked by Russian propaganda.
[42:12.760 --> 42:15.000]  Fourth on the list, right after those three.
[42:15.000 --> 42:23.920]  We'll get right on the check. Well, I don't know. Why don't I, I'll take a, take another
[42:23.920 --> 42:29.120]  break here. It seems like as good a time as ever. And I talked to you about another sponsor
[42:29.120 --> 42:37.160]  of the show, Casper. And boy does Casper have a deal for you. They have a special limited
[42:37.160 --> 42:42.120]  time President's Day offer. This is the first time they've ever done this. I think it's
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.920]  the first time they've done anything like this, but they've got a terrific offer.
[42:46.920 --> 42:53.640]  Casper is a sleep company. They make three lines of mattresses. Now they have the original
[42:53.640 --> 43:00.600]  Casper, the RIT, the innovative wave mattress and the streamlined essential, but they're
[43:00.600 --> 43:06.720]  not just a mattress company. They also offer sheets, pillows, uh, and even bed frames.
[43:06.720 --> 43:12.200]  They are the place to shop for President's Day mattress savings this year. It's, I don't
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.680]  know why President's Day seems to be like a big mattress promotional period. Well, Casper's
[43:16.680 --> 43:24.960]  on board, uh, and they make these mattresses, uh, right here in the United States. They're
[43:24.960 --> 43:31.400]  designed and made right here in the United States. Uh, and you can be sure of your purchase
[43:31.400 --> 43:38.760]  with whatever you wind up with. Um, with their a hundred night risk free sleep on it trial
[43:38.760 --> 43:44.480]  and returns are hassle free if you're not completely satisfied. Uh, really is that easy.
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.180]  You just buy it, it shows up at your house, you unpack it from the clever little box and
[43:50.180 --> 43:55.280]  wait for the air to fill up the foam and boom, you've got a mattress and if you don't like
[43:55.280 --> 44:00.020]  it, they'll just take it right back. You got a hundred nights to try it out. Um, really
[44:00.020 --> 44:06.400]  is that easy and it really is a terrific product. Great company. Uh, we've got Casper mattresses
[44:06.400 --> 44:11.400]  here in the house. Everybody loves them. Uh, guests love them. We got people in the guest
[44:11.400 --> 44:18.400]  bedroom right now for a Superbowl parade. Uh, I worry that maybe we shouldn't have a
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.560]  Casper in the guest bedroom because maybe we have too many people coming back. Uh, maybe
[44:23.560 --> 44:27.440]  we should get like a real lumpy mattress in the guest bed. I think that's where you get
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.280]  the piece of crap from the, from the retail store. I think we made a, I think we made
[44:31.280 --> 44:36.000]  a terrible decision with that. Uh, that's how good these mattresses are. Uh, so for

[45:28.400 --> 45:33.040]  from now, probably a day after the show. I've had one for a little over a week now, a review
[45:33.040 --> 45:40.480]  unit from Apple after a, uh, a trip to California where I also got a tour of Apple's quote unquote
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.800]  audio lab, which I didn't really talk about in my review too much. A couple of other people
[45:44.800 --> 45:52.160]  did. I've got some links in here. I thought, um, uh, Dow Rumple's review had a good look
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.400]  at the, you know, a good summary of the behind the scenes. That's what I was hoping. I was
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.520]  hoping that somebody else who was on this tour would, would have written that aspect
[46:00.520 --> 46:08.080]  of it up cause it was pretty interesting. Um, I don't know. What are you curious about?
[46:08.080 --> 46:14.800]  Well, I think I'm most curious to see how it does. I mean, we've seen, like you said,
[46:14.800 --> 46:20.520]  these reviews are out now and there's probably a good half dozen to dozen of them. And certainly
[46:20.520 --> 46:26.160]  none of them are glowing reviews that say you have to get this device. And I think,
[46:26.160 --> 46:28.800]  you know, that's, that's a pretty high bar obviously, but you know, that's something
[46:28.800 --> 46:33.640]  that I guess I maybe, maybe I've got rose-colored glasses on, but like when the iPhone came
[46:33.640 --> 46:39.320]  out, were there, do you remember what the reviews were like for the first iPhone?
[46:39.320 --> 46:44.080]  Well, they were severely limited. There were only four people who got it. It was Pogue,
[46:44.080 --> 46:53.760]  Ed Begg, Mossberg, and Steven Levy, who was at the time at Newsweek. I don't think they
[46:53.760 --> 46:57.640]  quite knew what to make of it. I do remember that they, the four of them got together and,
[46:57.640 --> 47:03.160]  and on the 10th year anniversary and I did reread them and none of the reviews had any
[47:03.160 --> 47:07.360]  clunkers in them. You know, nobody, none of those. And I think, you know, Apple was, you
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.260]  know, wise and they knew it, they knew they were getting four smart people to review it.
[47:12.260 --> 47:19.800]  So nobody had the knee-jerk reaction of every other phone on the market has a hardware green
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.560]  button for making calls and a red one for hanging up and why in the world, you know,
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.600]  something stupid like that. Why in the world doesn't this phone have this?
[47:28.600 --> 47:33.280]  You know, there's the classic iPod slash dot review of, I can't even remember exactly what
[47:33.280 --> 47:39.520]  it was, but like less space than a Nomad something. Yeah. I remember, but yeah, it was like, it
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.880]  was like 10 words that they all, they all turned out to be just foolish sounding after
[47:43.880 --> 47:44.880]  the fact.
[47:44.880 --> 47:50.200]  Right. And nobody wants to touch on glad they were, the reviews were good. I think the reviews
[47:50.200 --> 47:53.560]  saw the potential. All four of them saw the potential and were pretty good, but none of
[47:53.560 --> 48:00.600]  them were like, you should run out and buy it because I feel like that the 699 or 599
[48:00.600 --> 48:07.080]  starting price of like the four gig model was still exceedingly high by cell phone standards
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.500]  because it wasn't on any kind of contract. And I know a lot of people today are no longer
[48:12.500 --> 48:21.680]  buying their phones on contract, but that's, that's after 11 years of like weaning us towards
[48:21.680 --> 48:29.760]  having 500 to $1,000 cell phones after, you know, whereas 10 years ago everybody was used
[48:29.760 --> 48:36.560]  to buying quote unquote $29 cell phones that you know were $29 on contract from Nokia and
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.360]  your carrier or whoever. But everybody had this mental model that your cell phone costs,
[48:42.360 --> 48:48.000]  you know, like $29 or maybe if you got an expensive one like a razor or something like
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.920]  a few hundred dollars, but the idea of a $700 cell phone was so seemed so outlandish that
[48:54.920 --> 48:57.760]  I think they were hesitant to tell people you got to go out and get it just because
[48:57.760 --> 49:03.440]  it was too much. And I think it was too hard to foresee at the time how people would see
[49:03.440 --> 49:10.600]  value in that in terms of it really replacing your laptop for many purposes.
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.120]  Right. Well, so, so anyway, so I, you know, I was thinking about this because the reviews
[49:16.120 --> 49:20.560]  currently out for the HomePod have not been tremendous. There's good aspects. You know,
[49:20.560 --> 49:23.960]  people are talking about how high quality the audio is. That's, you know, that makes
[49:23.960 --> 49:30.480]  sense. They're doing a tour of the audio facility there. And it certainly sounds like it sounds
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.080]  great. But in terms of just comparing to what's already on the market, it certainly isn't
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.920]  blowing anything away. So I'm curious, not I've got one coming on Friday. You know, I
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.380]  need it for work. I don't know that I'd get it for myself, but I'm curious how it plays
[49:45.380 --> 49:50.560]  out over the next, say, three to nine months, more than just any individual thing on it.
[49:50.560 --> 49:53.920]  I don't know. Is there anything specific that you I mean, you just wrote a review of it,
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.960]  obviously. But is there anything specific that jumped out, jumped out to you that was
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.040]  interesting? Or I guess one thing that you mentioned was being able to give commands
[50:03.040 --> 50:08.160]  to it without sort of yelling over the music if you're playing music. That's that's that's
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.360]  one that was interesting to me. I'm interested to experiment with that, even if I don't know
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.660]  that it's something that's super useful.
[50:13.660 --> 50:20.680]  It is super useful. I think if you ever plan to play music at a even reasonably loud volume,
[50:20.680 --> 50:24.880]  and it's it really is uncanny. I think that's the word I used in the review. It's it works
[50:24.880 --> 50:31.320]  uncannily well, because it you don't expect it I didn't expect it to be able to work better
[50:31.320 --> 50:37.360]  than human ears. So imagine if if you and I are in the same room where a home pod is
[50:37.360 --> 50:44.040]  blaring music relatively loudly. And you're standing eight feet away from me. There's
[50:44.040 --> 50:50.620]  a certain volume that I'm going to if I want to say to you, hey, do you want another beverage?
[50:50.620 --> 50:56.520]  I'm going to say it at a certain volume that I think you'll probably still hear me. And
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.720]  I you know, and I think I'm I think, you know, anybody who's lived life for a while is pretty
[51:00.720 --> 51:05.120]  good at getting that volume about right. You know, where you don't sound like you're screaming
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.840]  too loud. But you're speaking louder than you would without the music on. Whereas with
[51:08.840 --> 51:16.100]  the home pod, you can say, hey, dingus, whatever to it at a volume that if there was another
[51:16.100 --> 51:20.260]  person in the room, you'd have you would you would never think that they would hear it.
[51:20.260 --> 51:24.200]  Or they might hear that you're saying something, but they would never understand it.
[51:24.200 --> 51:29.080]  Right. So that's, that's definitely interesting. And it sounds like from what you said, and
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.220]  from your experiments with it that, you know, it's fairly impressive. And it's not something
[51:33.220 --> 51:37.140]  that I saw, at least that Apple had touched on or that Apple had, is that something that
[51:37.140 --> 51:39.440]  they at least mentioned to you? Or is that something that you discovered?
[51:39.440 --> 51:44.440]  No, they mentioned it to us, to me, at least to my group, at least while we were in California.
[51:44.440 --> 51:45.440]  Okay.
[51:45.440 --> 51:53.240]  Yeah, it's, and it is at an engineering level. And I think it's, I think it is inextricably
[51:53.240 --> 52:00.720]  tied both to the hardware of the microphones and the software, you know, the software running,
[52:00.720 --> 52:04.400]  it's a version of iOS, it's like a lot of these other gadgets Apple's come out with
[52:04.400 --> 52:09.880]  where it's really running a variant of iOS, the version number right now is even 11.2.5,
[52:09.880 --> 52:16.840]  the same version number as the version on your phone, you know, right. It's a combination
[52:16.840 --> 52:23.100]  of the mics being really good, the mics being oriented in a certain way, and the mics knowing
[52:23.100 --> 52:34.360]  exactly how the seven tweeters and the woofer are oriented. And, you know, you know, and
[52:34.360 --> 52:40.440]  it's one of those funny things where Apple wanted to, I'm not surprised that they're
[52:40.440 --> 52:45.560]  not like making it a major advertising component. But they definitely wanted us to know about
[52:45.560 --> 52:52.800]  it. I definitely noticed it in the demos that Apple performed for me, that they
[52:52.800 --> 52:53.800]  Okay.
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.580]  You know, she clearly, the woman who was doing the demos, clearly wasn't speaking I thought
[52:58.580 --> 53:02.520]  loud enough, but it was hearing her almost perfectly. I mean, there were a whole bunch
[53:02.520 --> 53:09.060]  of commands and there was like one or two she had to repeat. But it was, and I know
[53:09.060 --> 53:15.920]  any other thing combining that is that firsthand as a year long owner of an Amazon Alexa, with
[53:15.920 --> 53:19.640]  the Alexa, it's not that you have to scream, but you have to talk at least as loud as you'd
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.120]  have to talk to a human being over the same volume of music.
[53:24.120 --> 53:27.740]  So you've got, you've got, I think you mentioned you've got an echo in the kitchen,
[53:27.740 --> 53:30.800]  do you have how many do you have throughout the house, like two or three?
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.200]  Yeah, we've got one in Jonas's room and another a dot in the living room. But the
[53:36.200 --> 53:40.820]  living room is that kitchen are on the same floor. And it's it's it's maddening, because
[53:40.820 --> 53:44.040]  I'll be in the kitchen. The same thing happens to Amy is we'll be in the kitchen and we'll
[53:44.040 --> 53:51.180]  say, you know, the Alexa name. Hopefully, I said that in a way that won't trigger
[53:51.180 --> 53:58.820]  people's things. Right. And then whatever, at a relatively same volume. And it's like,
[53:58.820 --> 54:03.960]  for whatever reason, the one in the living room at the other end of the of the floor,
[54:03.960 --> 54:09.560]  is kicks in. And it's like, what is like crazy? I don't understand how that's possible.
[54:09.560 --> 54:12.360]  And does the kitchen one not kick in? Or do they both kick in?
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.760]  No, it's only the one the other one. I don't know how that is. It's very strange. And it
[54:16.760 --> 54:19.280]  doesn't happen all the time. It certainly doesn't happen most of the time, or I would
[54:19.280 --> 54:25.120]  have thrown the things out the window. But it happens enough that it's crazy. And it's
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.080]  like, and one way, one way it manifests itself is like Amy certainly sends the most timers
[54:30.080 --> 54:35.600]  because in the kitchen, because she's she cooks more things that need to be timed. And
[54:35.600 --> 54:41.920]  I think what happens every once in a while, she'll tell it to set a timer. And thinks
[54:41.920 --> 54:45.520]  it didn't hear. And then she'll tell it to set the timer again, and it hears her and
[54:45.520 --> 54:51.480]  it goes off. But meanwhile, the dot out in the other room, I don't know, 30, 40 feet
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.680]  away, heard it too, and nobody's in there. And it set a timer. And then like, you know,
[54:56.680 --> 55:01.240]  15 minutes later, the dot is making the little alarm sound. And it's like, who the hell did
[55:01.240 --> 55:02.840]  that? Anyway.
[55:02.840 --> 55:08.400]  Well, so I'm interested, I'm interested to hear, you know, you've like you said, you've
[55:08.400 --> 55:13.200]  had these Echo devices for about a year, and you've had, did they just gave you one HomePod
[55:13.200 --> 55:14.200]  to test with?
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.120]  That is correct. Because it's right now. And the HomePod we got for testing is running
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.200]  the production software that will be on the ones that come in the mail on two days, or
[55:25.200 --> 55:30.160]  that you can buy in a store in two days. So because ours are running, which is the way
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.880]  I would prefer it, I would not I would be, I would have been very uncomfortable. I don't
[55:34.880 --> 55:37.040]  know what I would have done, in fact, because I
[55:37.040 --> 55:40.800]  Right throwing in caveats of, you know, testing something that's not yet available.
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.520]  Right, I would have I would have if I was running one with with a pre release version
[55:45.520 --> 55:52.080]  of 11.3. With the AirPlay two stuff on it, I would have had a may I would have mentioned
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.360]  it up front, and I would have had to mention it every step of the way I would have I don't
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.120]  I would have made me very, I don't know. So I'm glad and I think that the same reason
[56:00.120 --> 56:05.360]  that I'm glad is the reason that they gave us the production firmware, whatever you want
[56:05.360 --> 56:08.480]  to call it. So anyway, they only gave us one because there's really no point to having
[56:08.480 --> 56:13.280]  two yet. I mean, I guess you could set it up as two independent devices, but it's not
[56:13.280 --> 56:14.800]  really going to help you review anything.
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.640]  Sure. But so in your in your actual use case in your house, you it's if you've got three
[56:20.640 --> 56:28.000]  different Echo devices. I guess that's sort of the question is, does Do you think and
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.960]  does Apple think that people are going to use this in the same way that people use an
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.040]  Echo currently or use a Google Home currently?
[56:35.040 --> 56:35.440]  No.
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.000]  Or exactly. And because they've been so focused on the music aspect of it, it really seems
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.360]  like, you know, maybe you only get one of these for the house and you put it wherever
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.480]  you have your biggest TV or your stereo system if you still have one of those. And it sort
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.040]  of joins in that way, as opposed to Amazon's idea that, you know, maybe you have one of
[56:53.040 --> 56:54.720]  these in every single room of the house.
[56:54.720 --> 57:01.840]  Right. Although I think you could have them in multiple rooms. I think, you know, I think
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.960]  it varies greatly by the layout of your home. Like, do you have this sort of floor plan?
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.400]  We're putting one in the dining room and the kitchen and having them sink together to play
[57:12.400 --> 57:20.960]  the same song at the same time makes sense. We kind of do. That might make sense for us
[57:20.960 --> 57:26.480]  to have to that way, because from our dining room, you can walk right through to the kitchen.
[57:26.480 --> 57:30.800]  But if we if the if the HomePod was in the kitchen, you wouldn't really consider it a
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.720]  source for music in the dining room and outside the kitchen, right?
[57:34.720 --> 57:43.040]  Right. So I think it comes down to the fact that it really is music first. It really is
[57:43.040 --> 57:47.520]  a thing that's meant to be playing music. And I think the other thing I think that you
[57:47.520 --> 57:51.520]  mentioned that the one place where I feel like the HomePod really doesn't fit is in
[57:52.080 --> 57:58.480]  the room with your TV, or at least not unless you want to use it completely separately from
[57:58.480 --> 57:59.200]  your TV.
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.840]  Like, sorry, that is what I meant. Yeah. That's as the same way that, you know, you might
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.920]  have a stereo there that is at least in my mom's house, she has a TV here and a stereo
[58:07.920 --> 58:11.680]  there. And they're completely divorced from one another or completely unrelated to one
[58:11.680 --> 58:17.600]  another. But it's where you do your listening or your viewing. But right, yeah, that was
[58:17.600 --> 58:21.440]  something interesting that you wrote about was that it's not designed to hook up to your TV.
[58:21.440 --> 58:26.640]  And this is a super high quality speaker that doesn't have an input and can't really take
[58:26.640 --> 58:33.600]  audio from your TV short of having your Apple TV send to it. Which is, I don't know, you
[58:33.600 --> 58:37.920]  you had talked about not having a line input because Apple, you know, is thinking that
[58:37.920 --> 58:43.360]  everything's gonna be wireless. And that's, I get that. But it's a pretty cheap part to
[58:43.360 --> 58:48.160]  add to this. And when everything else on this is fairly high end, and you, you know, you
[58:48.160 --> 58:53.360]  could say, Well, I just want to be able to take my device somewhere and plug in audio
[58:53.360 --> 58:59.280]  to it without having to wirelessly send to it. I don't know, that's one that it wouldn't
[58:59.280 --> 59:02.960]  make me not purchase it if I were interested to purchase it. But it seems like something
[59:02.960 --> 59:08.480]  that doesn't necessarily make sense to cut the same way that they made some changes on
[59:08.480 --> 59:12.560]  like the phone where, you know, a headphone jack, supposedly, at least had something to
[59:12.560 --> 59:16.720]  do with waterproofing. Obviously, you're not waterproofing the HomePod. So it's there's
[59:16.720 --> 59:20.960]  not a an obvious reason to cut this, besides the idea that no, we just want everyone to
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.200]  focus on wireless audio to this thing. Well, I think there's also a simplicity angle though,
[59:25.200 --> 59:30.880]  because if you have a line in, and then you're pumping your TV to it, and you're watching
[59:30.880 --> 59:36.400]  a movie, what happens when you say, hey, dingus, play whatever to it? Does it start playing
[59:36.400 --> 59:41.600]  the music you just asked it to play? Or does it keep playing the TV input on line in? And
[59:41.600 --> 59:47.040]  what happens when you tap the top of it, which typically does play pause? Does it stop? And
[59:47.040 --> 59:54.000]  how would top how would tapping the stop button on a speaker getting a dumb line in signal
[59:54.000 --> 59:59.600]  right? Go back to pause the TV? It couldn't. So that's that's certainly a good point. Yeah,
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.760]  absolutely. You know, I do I mentioned it in my review, it does seem wasteful. If you want
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.920]  to put it in a room where you already have a TV and some kind of speaker system, it seems
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.040]  wasteful to add another wholly independent speaker system. It is right, you know, what
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:19.280]  is that word? I was gonna say duplicitous. But duplicitous means deceitful, superfluous,
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:27.120]  superfluous, right? It does seem superfluous. But I get it. I think it's for a simplicity
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.960]  where it's always just playing either what you tell it to, or acting as an airplay speaker
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:39.200]  and acting as an airplay speaker. Never. I don't know, because you can set Apple TV to
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:46.160]  talk to it as an airplay speaker. I don't know. I you know, I don't feel like I feel
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.640]  much stronger. I feel like getting rid of the headphone jack on the phones is the right
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.640]  way. I feel like it was the right decision last year. I really do. On the line in, I'm
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.520]  a little bit more ambivalent. I'm okay with this product not having it. But if it did
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.800]  have it, I wouldn't. I wouldn't think that they were sticking with an older technology
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.640]  for no good reason, like I would have if they didn't get rid of the headphone jack.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.600]  I'm more ambivalent about it.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.840]  What else about it? I do think if there's one thing, excuse me, Paul, there's one thing
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.760]  I mentioned I saw in a couple of reviews, I think Matthew Pansarinos in particular,
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.840]  which was really interesting to me, because he knows and I knew this, like, you know,
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:37.040]  like a career ago, he was actually working as a salesman in a, you know, like a high end
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:46.000]  stereo shop. So he really knows a lot more about why speakers, one speaker sounds better
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.960]  than another, or where one speaker sounds better and another one doesn't and why and
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.000]  stuff like that than I do. I just kind of listen to one listen to the other and then
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  like, I can tell I like that one better. I just I don't know. Right. But he mentioned
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.480]  something. And I think it's absolutely true is that. And it's just the layout of our
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.560]  current house just and where I could try it. I don't really have a smaller and smaller
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:20.080]  room. And in a small room it and I saw I heard a couple of demos because you know, like when
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.160]  Apple demoed these things for us. It was in an actual house like they don't know if they
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.240]  rented it or whatever, but it was in a real house of real dimensions, you know, and had
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.400]  real furnishings and stuff there. And I think very typical, you know, I don't think it
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:44.640]  was, you know, there was nothing weird or set up about it. Including some cameras on
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.800]  every unit and you're in all sorts of videos now, but but they had like a downstairs with
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.840]  like a like a very modern floor plan for a living room living floor, where the kitchen
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.760]  flows right into the living room without a wall just with like a kitchen island between
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.360]  them, which is you know, I've been I know so many people who have a floor plan like
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.960]  that, which is a bigger, bigger, much bigger space more risk for more ways that you could
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.320]  get echoes. And then a smaller room upstairs, which would be just a very, very typical or
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.160]  they even had a bedroom, there was even a bed in a very typical bedroom, and then maybe
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:28.480]  like a very typical home office type room. And in those smaller rooms, it was really
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.880]  more startling how good it sounded. And I in my personal testing at home, it sounded
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.040]  good. It sounded better than any other thing I've tried in these rooms. But I feel like
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.640]  our place is a little bit has more space, bigger rooms and more echoey rooms.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.280]  So that's one thing too, is there's a lot of, you know, the smaller your room, I think
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.480]  the better this thing is going to sound. And it really is almost sounds phenomenal. And
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:59.600]  and the effect of not quite coming from a single point is way more pronounced in a smaller
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.320]  room. That's and that's the other thing that I remember from the demos. And it's not
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.720]  like it fools you into thinking that there's two speakers on two sides of the room, you
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.280]  could close your eyes and point to where the HomePod is, right? Or you could point to
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.360]  where the HomePod is, right? Or, like if you're in a, you know, a small room, and there's
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.600]  one HomePod, and somebody spins you around, like pin the tail on the donkey, and they're
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.360]  like, where's the HomePod? You'll get very close to it when you point it, but it doesn't
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.960]  sound like it's coming from a tiny little seven inch point. It really does have a dimensionality,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:39.760]  a 3D-ness to it, that seems like something, you know, a next level up in small speaker
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.240]  design.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.880]  So do you think that all these reviews have talked about, you know, this audio quality
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.960]  and Apple touted this, and it sounds like that is true, that this has phenomenal audio
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.960]  quality and better than, you know, the other devices that are out there, certainly better
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.200]  than the cheaper devices that are out there, and sounds like better than even the devices
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.480]  that are comparably priced from, you know, the Google Home Max and Sonos. Is that enough
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.000]  to make this thing sell, though?
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.400]  I don't know. I thought before I started my review, just knowing what I knew, you know,
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.480]  you know, what Apple had said coming up to it, and up to the point where I met with their,
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.440]  you know, engineers, and the next day got a briefing and headed home with my review
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.640]  unit. Before it and after it, I really, I have, I don't know what I would, which way
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.920]  I would bet on how successful this product would be. My guess is that the best case scenario
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:40.560]  is a sort of slowly building hit, sort of like Apple Watch, you know, where, although
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.840]  without that initial, like, Apple Watch debuted with like a, you could, you know, all of a
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.520]  sudden it was backordered six weeks.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.360]  Right. Everybody wanted that up front.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.520]  But then once that subsided, it was sort of like you didn't really see a lot of people
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.880]  with Apple Watch the first year, but then it seemed like through word of mouth. It's
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.560]  the sort of thing that I feel like you need word of mouth for, and that people might come
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.360]  to your house and if you have a HomePod, they might be really impressed by it and think,
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.360]  wow, that really does sound good. I might get one of those. But I could, I could see
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:20.480]  it all the way to being, you know, the iPod 2, HiFi, the iPod HiFi 2.0, you know, that
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.600]  Apple built this thing that they seemingly spent a lot of engineering time on and seemingly
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.360]  are very proud of and really think people are going to like and people just don't want
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.720]  to spend 300 plus dollars on something that just plays music from Apple.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.880]  And was that, I'm trying to remember, was that $4.99, the iPod HiFi?
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.040]  I don't remember how much it was. We could.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.920]  I think that's, I don't want to, we should look it up, but it was, it was definitely,
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.880]  I think, even more expensive than this and obviously did a lot less. That was literally
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.520]  just a speaker that took audio from an iPod.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.960]  Nope, it was three. It didn't take commands or anything like that.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.080]  It was $349.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.480]  Oh, was it? Was it exactly the same price? I guess I feel like I remember people saying
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.920]  that now that I, now that I think about it.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.960]  That's even funnier. My God, is it bigger. It's, it's ridiculous how much bigger the
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.920]  iPod HiFi was.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.040]  Oh, it was enormous. Yeah. And especially compared to the device that you were, you
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.760]  were putting on it.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.480]  I never bought one of those. I had no desire to buy one. But boy, I kind of wish I had
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.840]  one laying around because that would be a fun side-by-side review.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.240]  Oh, comparison test. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.360]  See how much better it sounds.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.960]  I thought Pansarino, I think I was Pansarino, had another observation that I thought was
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:40.880]  spot on where he described the iPod HiFi's sound as being, I think he said accurate.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.200]  Wait, the iPod HiFi or the HomePod?
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.720]  Not the iPod. Yeah, you've got me thrown off the HomePod. And everybody agreed. If
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.720]  you saw it, there were, if you read it, the, I'll put a link to all these, a couple of
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.480]  these reviews in there. But there was a strong consensus among everybody that the Google
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:06.320]  Home Max, which is their $399 dingus, which is the, you know, $50 more than the, the HomePod.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:14.160]  So clearly, you know, fair comparison is way too bass heavy, you know, which some people
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.400]  like, but it's like one of those things that's like the TVs in the store being oversaturated
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.880]  because you're in there looking at 17 different TVs and the ones with the saturated colors
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.760]  look like, wow, that one has, that other one looks bland. This one has pop. I want the
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.240]  one with pop, but you would never, it's like inaccurate. You'd never really want to tune
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.520]  your TV that way. It's, you know, and, and I think it's also similar to the way that
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:51.600]  Apple has calibrated its screens forever, but especially like in the iPhone era where
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.280]  Apple, one of the reasons that they were one of the last, if not the last major phone company
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.400]  to put out a phone with an OLED display was that in the early days of OLED, while there
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.760]  are some advantages to battery life and certainly all along batteries or advantages to the richer
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.680]  blacks, color accuracy was really, really hard and really has only come in the last
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.520]  few years. And even though once it came on other phones, it still couldn't come in the
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.800]  quantities Apple needed. Like Apple was never going to ship an OLED phone until they could
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.080]  ship it in the quantities they needed and with the color accuracy that they wanted.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.160]  And one day I'm picky about color. I really, I've always been very picky about color. And
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.920]  the one thing I've noticed with the iPhone 10 now that I've had it for months is even
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.560]  when I see it side by side with anybody else who has like an iPhone 8 or a 7 or any other
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.720]  recent iPhone is the one thing I don't notice is I don't notice any difference in color.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.520]  I really don't. And you know, I feel like that is exactly what they've done with sound
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.240]  on the HomePod where they're being very, very fair to the original. They're not pumping
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.120]  up the base. They're not doing other, like the audio equivalent of sugar sweetening,
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.600]  the audio tweaking it to make it sound supposedly better, but
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.240]  bastardizing it a little bit. Right. I would say that that's, that's very fair.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.640]  I think the other thing that I got out of this, I feel like there's three factors
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.640]  in the decision of does somebody want a HomePod? One is, do you care enough about, do you have a,
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.520]  do you have a, do you have a place in your life where a $350 speaker that sounds really good
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.400]  makes sense? And, and, you know, for some people that might be no, you know, it might be nowhere,
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.320]  you know, you might not have a room in your house or an office where you can do that. You know,
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.080]  if you work in a cubicle or something like that, I don't think your cubicle mates are
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.840]  going to appreciate it if you set up a HomePod. But it's going to sound great.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:54.400]  Right. And there might be people out there who like hear the $89 Amazon Alexa play music
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.960]  and say, that's good enough for me. And why in the world would I spend four times more
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:03.040]  on this other thing? So that's one factor. Do you have a spot in your life where you're
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:12.880]  willing to spend $350 for audio that you, you would appreciate? Two is the issue of
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.200]  where do you have, where's your music come from? You know, if your music, if you're heavily into
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.880]  Spotify, and Spotify keeps coming up over and over and over again, and all these reviews,
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.640]  because some of these other products support Spotify as a first class like source of talking
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:35.360]  to the device to play music from Spotify. And HomePod doesn't. There's no way you want HomePod,
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.640]  in my opinion, if you're heavily into Spotify, and you don't want to leave, then I really can't
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:47.120]  see why you'd want to switch to HomePod, even if the sound is a little better. Right. And conversely,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.400]  if you are on the opposite, if you're heavily into the Apple Music ecosystem, lowercase m,
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.200]  because I'll include in that the Apple Music capital M subscription service,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.280]  iTunes Music Store, any purchases that you've ever made, or see any music that you own in
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:14.880]  your personal library, if you have iTunes match or Apple Music, they'll sync to the cloud,
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.800]  and then you can talk to your HomePod and have it play those. And in fact,
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.720]  that's most of the music testing I did this week, because I was so interested in that is how I had
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:28.720]  to play a bunch of Rolling Stones albums I have that are not and have never been available from
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:36.000]  the iTunes store. And it worked great. So if you're into the Apple system, yeah, and you could
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.160]  just say and it's funny, it got smarter too. I have an album. I think it's a 1973 album.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.640]  1973 live recording called the Brussels Affair recorded in Brussels. One of my all time favorite
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.320]  Rolling Stones albums. And the first time I asked the HomePod to play the Rolling Stones Brussels
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.280]  Affair, I think that's what I asked for play the Rolling Stones Brussels Affair. HomePod told me
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:08.560]  that it couldn't find any music Brussels Affair. And I thought, Oh, damn, that's this sinking. I
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  thought the damn sinking feature wasn't working. So I thought about it. And I looked in my library,
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:21.520]  and the actual file name I have on the album is Brussels Affair parentheses, live 1973.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:30.800]  So I said, I asked the HomePod to play Brussels Affair live 1973. And it said, okay,
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.920]  here's the Rolling Stones Brussels Affair live 1973. And it just started playing. And I thought,
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.040]  well, that's a little bit of a pain in the ass, but that's okay. But then like the next day,
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.120]  I said, Hey, play the Brussels Affair. And it said, Okay, here's the Rolling Stones Brussels
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.200]  Affair. And then it worked. Now, I don't know if it learned. I don't know if it just needed to sink.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.120]  You know, if I asked it the first time before it was done sinking, I don't know what right.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.240]  You know, and that's one of the things about these talking dinguses is you never know why
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.200]  why it works one day and doesn't work the other day. Well, so can I can I can I pick this bone
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.280]  that I have with you? Yeah, absolutely. Well, before we do this, let's save that. Let's save
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.680]  that. And I did want to mention I wanted to mention one review in particular that I thought
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.240]  was kind of crappy was Brian Chen's review for the New York Times. Because I feel like all the
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.840]  other reviews I largely agree, even if I didn't agree completely, I thought they were all pretty
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.400]  accurate. And I thought Chen's review for the New York Times was way out of line, because it was
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.680]  sort of like it started with him talking about using it to listen to music. And he said, you
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.320]  know, hey, play some music, and it played music he didn't like. And he tried to get it to stop.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.040]  And instead of stopping, it said it, you know, didn't recognize whatever artist he's complaining
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  about album stop or something like that. And then he kind of went right to like a 14 point
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.280]  comparison of trying to get these, you know, multiple of these devices to to do assistant
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:06.320]  type things, like create calendar events and, and stuff like that. And creating calendar events is
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.400]  something HomePod doesn't do now. I'm not saying it's not fair to mention that. But it's like his
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:20.720]  whole review was pretty much comparing it to me, it would be the equivalent of if he wrote a review
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:29.200]  of the the new Amazon Echo, and quickly brushed over a bunch of, you know, something that Alexa
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:34.640]  does that, you know, that does particularly well, and then just skipped right to a 14 point
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.040]  comparison of how good did the speaker sound? Right, and then that's a whole review of it.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.800]  Like, it's, it's totally fair to mention it. And I think almost my review and various others,
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.520]  you know, we're, you know, I don't see how you couldn't mention that Siri does less on HomePod
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.840]  than Alexa does on the Echo products, and that the Google Voice product, you know, which I feel like
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.920]  needs a name, like, I don't know what to call it, they call it like the device is Google Home Max,
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:12.080]  but and you address it as okay, Google. But it's so much doesn't have a personified, right? It's
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.800]  so much easier. It's just a small aside from writing a long review about this is it's so much
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:25.760]  easier to write about the separation between HomePod and Siri, and say the Echo, or the the
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:34.400]  Alexa equipped Sonos one hardware, and Alexa as the abstract service. I feel like I wish Google
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:40.000]  would fix that. But I you know, I don't. I guess you I guess we could just call the service. Okay,
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.840]  Google, I don't know. But anyway, that's an aside. Anyway, I thought Chen's review was sort of
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.760]  deliberately written to make it look bad. Like there's no way I don't see how there was any
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.480]  way that HomePod could come out of his review testing looking good there, because he was trying
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:59.200]  things that he knew in advance it couldn't do. Like, what's the point? But I mean, is that is
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.600]  that unfair? If those are the things that he wants it to do? I mean, it's not like he went and said,
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.920]  this car doesn't have any storage space. So it is a two seater convertible. So I'm going to try and
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.800]  haul, you know, two tons of potting soil in it. This is something that I think people who get a
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.000]  device of this type are going to try and do and this is, it's something where it certainly is
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.040]  lacking. And Apple definitely want wanted to frame this device and I think successfully
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.240]  framed a bunch of the reviews as, you know, there's some shortcomings, but the audio quality
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.720]  is great, or there the audio quality is great, despite other shortcomings. And his review was
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.760]  definitely it didn't really talk too much at all about the audio quality said, you know, I listened
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.840]  to some music that didn't work super well. And then Siri itself worked really poorly.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.600]  Is that do you think that's about an accurate summary of what he wrote?
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.760]  Yeah, I think so. I think that's a pretty accurate summary.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.400]  So I don't I don't know that. I mean, you're absolutely right. It was definitely
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.480]  one of the harshest reviews of the device. I don't think that he came at it in a super unfair way.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:13.280]  I wouldn't say super unfair. I would say, I would just say a I just don't think it was helpful.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.240]  You know, I mean, I don't know, I feel like I almost feel like the angle he took would be
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.200]  better as a follow up after reviewing it for what it is. And then you having a column of
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.480]  what type of device do you want in your house that talks to you? Which is two different things.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:36.640]  Well, I guess, to me, it's a question of how similar is this device to the Echo and the
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:42.400]  HomePod or sorry, and the Google Home rather. You know, are these really exactly the same type of
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.480]  device? Or are we getting down to the nitty gritty and saying, you know, you know what, there's
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.360]  actually virtual assistant devices that happen to play music, and there's music players that happen
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.040]  to have a virtual assistant. And those are two separate things. And I think to most, I would
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.840]  assume to most potential customers, those are the same thing. And, you know, it's just a question
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.440]  of which one of those you care about a little bit more. But that's a good way to put it. I think
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.680]  that's exactly a good way to put it. And that's how I tried to frame my review. And in fact,
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.200]  I even caught myself at one point, where I, in my review, I in an early draft of it, I had that,
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.960]  that the HomePod and Alexa clearly aren't even in the same category. And I realized that the other
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.360]  day, I had written that they are in the same category, but from different perspectives. And
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.600]  so I caught myself and realized, so the way I reworded it, and which I think is more accurate,
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.800]  is that they're at opposite ends of the category. Like, because really, like, I right now,
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.640]  we literally have the Alexa and the HomePod in the kitchen at the same time, both, you know,
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:51.120]  just mostly for testing reasons. Feature wise, because Amy is actually annoyed that the HomePod
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.720]  doesn't have the one thing she, one of the things she really likes about the Echo, which is being
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:01.360]  able to set multiple timers, which really feels like it's something that Apple could, could and
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:09.520]  should fix right away. Like with Alexa, you can say, set a potato timer for 20 minutes,
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:15.440]  and then like a minute later, say, what else might you be cooking with potatoes?
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.960]  Remind me about the boiling water in 10 minutes or whatever.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:26.880]  Right. And then you can say, Alexa, how much time do I have left on the potato timer? And she will
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:32.800]  tell you. And on the HomePod, if you set a timer, you can't name it, it's only one timer. And then
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.720]  if you set another timer, Siri will say you already have a timer with four minutes and
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.600]  33 seconds remaining, would you like to replace it? Like, that's your only option. And that's,
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:51.440]  you know, pretty sure that iOS is an A8 processor could handle running two timers at the same time.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.360]  Well, now I'm trying to think, does the phone let you do multiple times?
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.800]  No, the phone doesn't either.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.160]  I don't think it does, right?
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:06.720]  No. So, you know, and you know, it's a feature she uses. It's not a crazy feature. I don't think
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.360]  that's esoteric, you know, I feel like and I feel like once you get, I hear this a lot. It's
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.720]  clearly putting these things in a kitchen is very popular. And setting timers is hugely popular.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:24.400]  And it's just, it's just one of those like, tiny little, you know, once you get used to just to
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.760]  go back to it, once you get used to indoor plumbing, there's no going back to outdoor
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.520]  plumbing. You know, people have been cooking for thousands of years, and they've used various ways
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:42.640]  of determining how long to cook a thing. But the idea of having to touch a device to set a timer,
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.960]  is it once you go to just doing it by voice, it's so right, it just seems barbaric.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.200]  Because, you know, a lot of times, if you're in the kitchen cooking, your hands are might
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.280]  be covered with stuff, or you might not be near the device, or, you know, various reasons.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.080]  It's just so nice. And it's just, you know, so anyway, that's something Apple's got to get on.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.880]  All right, now can I now can I get you with this thing?
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.000]  Absolutely, absolutely. I feel like this is a fantastic discussion.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:19.520]  All right. So six, no, I guess about eight months ago, the HomePod was announced. And you had a post
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:27.120]  that I assume you will link to about the HomePod having a touchscreen. And prior to the announcement,
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.600]  there were all the rumors floating around and multiple rumors sites reported,
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.640]  multiple rumor sites reported that it did not have a touchscreen. Unlike the, what is it,
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.440]  the Amazon Echo Show, I think is the one that has a screen.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.400]  Which you don't hear about much anymore, by the way. In this whole-
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.160]  Yeah, that came out. And I don't know if it's, I don't know anything about that one,
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.640]  except that it has a screen. And I guess it exists. But so after this was announced,
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.640]  you said, you know, claim chowder, it does have a touchscreen. And you and I had a discussion about
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.680]  this. And I said, I don't think that that constitutes a touchscreen. And you, you stuck
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.760]  to your guns. And you said now that you touch it, and I don't know, you can summarize your own
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.520]  position. Well, I don't think it was multiple rumor sites, though. I think it was a Bloomberg
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.680]  report by Mark Gurman and Alex Webb for Bloomberg. And it was, I think, about a week before WWDC.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.560]  And their exact words are, ahead of Apple's launch, the competition has upgraded their
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:31.600]  speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon's gained a touchscreen. Apple's
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.880]  speaker won't include such a screen, according to people who have seen the project, product.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.840]  And then Ming-Chi Kuo, two weeks before that, said, we also believe this new product will
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.280]  come with a touch panel. Okay, and then you wrote HomePod has a touchscreen on top.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:53.760]  Right, after seeing it at WWDC. This was, I've posted it Tuesday, so it was like within a day
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:01.360]  of the keynote. And I was under the impression, now this was, I forget if I'd had my hands on,
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.200]  I don't think I had, I don't think that had the briefing yet. Maybe I did though, maybe they did
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.240]  that on Monday. I don't remember when, in addition to the one that they had out there for everybody
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:16.880]  to walk by, but not touch, we also got invited in like little groups of four to hear it,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.240]  but not touch it. And we weren't allowed to speak to it or anything.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.880]  But I saw the plus and minus buttons that you could touch for volume. And I saw the Siri,
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.240]  I'll call it a waveform, but the, you know, primary colored, circular animated,
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:42.080]  you know, swirly cloud animation. And assumed incorrectly that that was, you know, some sort of,
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.240]  like the equivalent of an iPhone screen showing these things. And that, you know, it could in
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:54.640]  theory, you know, show other things at, you know, under other circumstances. And I had no idea how
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.320]  it worked, other than that they said you could touch it to do the plus minus, but they wouldn't
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:07.440]  let us touch it. So we couldn't see how it worked. So you think I was wrong? You think I was wrong?
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:14.480]  You think I was wrong? I would say I am wrong. Because I would not call the thing on top of
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:21.440]  HomePod a touchscreen. What Ming-Chi Kuo called it a touch panel is probably better. It's weird
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:28.800]  what to call it because it doesn't show arbitrary pixels. You know, I'm kind of curious for iFixit
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:34.160]  to get more curious than for most products to have iFixit take this apart because I'm curious
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:41.040]  what the hell is under there to make the waveform. But what we've since heard from various birdies,
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.720]  not me directly, I think ATP might have had a birdie who said it, is that there's some kind of
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:52.640]  color LCDs under there. But it's more like, I don't know, like light bright type things,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.120]  you know, like not pixels that could display anything that, you know, like text, arbitrary
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.200]  information, but it's really only meant to create that Siri multicolored animation that
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.680]  color animation and then some kind of diffuser that makes it look blurry.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.560]  And like the plus and minus buttons are, I believe, just completely hard, you know,
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.240]  just they're just old fashioned buttons that are, you know, there's nothing else in plastic
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.640]  or whatever, right? They're not arbitrary pixels. They're just, you know, plus and minus.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.720]  So I looked this up, and Apple refers to it, you can go to their tech specs, and they call
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:37.200]  it the touch surface, which I guess would apply to pretty much anything you can touch. But
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.520]  it's definitely not, they don't refer to it as a touch screen. Because like you said,
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.880]  I think that's that to me, I guess, is the definition is that it can't display
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:54.960]  an arbitrary image. And that to me is what a touchscreen can do. Touchscreen ATM can display
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.880]  whatever you put on it, your phone obviously can display whatever you draw to it.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.560]  Trenton Larkin Touch surface, I guess that's fair.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.840]  John Wallis Touch surface. So touch panel sounds pretty much
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.200]  right to me as well. That's that seems like a pretty good name for it. Touch surface just
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.400]  sounds sort of meaningless. But that is the term that they're using.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.640]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I think I was wrong. I don't think
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.640]  Germin and Webb were right, though. I don't think saying it doesn't include such a screen is right
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.720]  either. Because you can, there is a touch thing that they didn't mention.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.640]  John Wallis Well, so the only thing that
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.680]  there, I think there, I think it was poor writing, if anything, they're saying the Amazon device has
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:35.440]  a true screen that displays the weather and whatever. And this the HomePod obviously does
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.800]  not have that. And if you just showed them side by side and said, this one has a screen and this
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.400]  one doesn't, you'd say, yeah, that's right. But because they're writing about things that they
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:50.320]  didn't have images of, and I think, like, like I said, didn't necessarily express it properly.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.960]  Express it properly. Then Yeah, I think I think you're right that it was not necessarily written
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.840]  the way that should have been. Trenton Larkin
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.200]  Right. You read it again. And it sounds to me like they weren't told by someone what the HomePod
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:08.000]  does present to you a Siri waveform and plus and minus volume buttons. But they were told that it
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.080]  doesn't present to you a John Wallis
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.360]  What the Amazon device does. Trenton Larkin
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.560]  Well, I just kicked Syrian somehow. Sorry about that. Sorry, Siri.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.840]  Here's a weird thing with the HomePod that I forgot to mention in my review.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.560]  It happened to me today, you know, which is really why I forgot to write I'd noticed it before.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.480]  But if you don't touch your HomePod or use it in a, you know, like a day, like, let's say,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.520]  I was using it yesterday, and I went to bed. And then I woke up today and did some work. And then
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.160]  I went out and then I record a podcast. And it's, you know, it's been like 18 hours since I've used
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.960]  the thing. And I go in there. And if I just touch the top, it'll just start playing whatever I left
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:57.920]  off on, like a day ago, 18 hours later, right. And it, you know, and like, I've, I've run into it.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.440]  And I mentioned in my review that the, at least on the space gray run, the touch surface is a
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.200]  fingerprint magnet. And I kind of wish it was either matte finished or had a better
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:12.560]  oleophobic coating. It's I've run into it where I look at it, and it looks like smudgy. And I want
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.320]  to just I kind of wipe it off. And I just go to wipe it off. And it just starts playing music
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:24.160]  real loud. It doesn't seem I don't know, it doesn't seem to me like it's it seems like that
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:29.120]  I could see where you it would like wake up and maybe maybe, you know, Siri should say hello to
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.880]  you or something. If it hasn't been playing for. I don't know what the threshold is. But there's
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.560]  some threshold in ours where if if if it hasn't been playing music, I feel like just touching it
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.960]  should just sort of wake it up. I'm not quite sure what wake it up means. But I you know,
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.040]  you know, more or less the prompt you get when you just hold the side button
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:54.320]  on the phone. Right? I don't think I don't think it should just start playing. When it is playing,
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:59.280]  of course, it tapping it to pause it is fantastic. It makes all the sense in the world.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.000]  But just randomly starting to play when you touch it is surprising.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.120]  Well, I'm interested to get it. I'm interested to fiddle with it. I don't know if it's gonna
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.880]  be something that I wind up using, or if it's something that I test with. And then
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.720]  that's sort of the end of it. But like I said, I'm definitely interested to see
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.960]  longer term whether this is something that, you know, do you think how about that? Do you think
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:29.280]  they have a HomePod 2 in development already? With I don't even know what features we think
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.720]  it would have. But you know, do they do you think they have a chain of these? Or is it something?
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.960]  No, I think it's iPod HiFi, where they were more on and that was it. I think it's more like Apple
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:44.320]  TV. And Apple TV had at least the in its current incarnation, since it went to like a, you know,
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:51.520]  a tv OS with an App Store. It had a very obvious next generation model with support for 4k.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:58.320]  I know there were other changes too. But just specifically going supporting 4k was an obvious
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:04.560]  need. And there's no such thing in audio, right? Like, so I wouldn't be so I think this is sort of
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:11.920]  like Apple TV without even the obvious 4k upgrade. And anything that's improved on this is all going
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:19.200]  to come on the software side, in terms of either some kind of SDK so that other services like
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:28.160]  Spotify can can be addressed directly by talking to the device. And so that apps, like things like
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:37.120]  podcast players, like Overcast and Castro can be addressed by talking to the device without having
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:42.640]  your phone nearby, you know, or even if it even if it's only with your phone nearby, but some way
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.920]  where you can just talk to it. Well, so I guess the only so thinking about the hardware, the only
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:52.000]  obvious thing that you could do to change it would be what we were just talking about is having some
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.720]  sort of display screen on it, which given what you said about the Echo Show, not. Well, I guess we
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.000]  don't really know. We have no idea how well that sold or anything. But it certainly has not been in
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.560]  the forefront. When you're talking about the Echo. It doesn't necessarily seem like that would be the
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.360]  obvious thing to do with this. So so yeah, it definitely does seem like software is where this
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.760]  will get upgraded. Yeah. So that's Yeah, I don't know that the whole thing is interesting to me
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.720]  because they've been talking they've said that they've been working on this for half a decade.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:26.800]  Yeah. And so it's it's very much not, oh, we got to play catch up with a virtual assistant. It seems
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.960]  more like, oh, we have this thing. And we can, you know, add a virtual assistant to it. So we'll do
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:37.120]  that. That makes sense. But they didn't necessarily want to enter that virtual assistant market as
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.800]  much as they wanted to have a high quality speaker. Yeah. You know, and it's, you know,
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.120]  a lot of people, people who are already invested in Spotify are very, very down on the thing. And
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.920]  I don't blame them if you really are and and talking to a couple of I'm not I have like a free
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:57.120]  Spotify account that I only use for poking around on it. But talking to various friends over the
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.600]  last week or two, some of them are really into Spotify sounds like Spotify has some fantastic
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:08.720]  features. Some really interesting features in terms of not telling Spotify to play, you know,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.640]  having something specific to play in mind. But being able to tell Spotify what you're in the
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:20.640]  mood for. And based on your previous preferences, it's like getting a radio station that is just
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:26.160]  perfect for you. And it plays things. Well, it's what Pandora, you know, claimed to do a decade ago
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.440]  and is still around and still trying to do. But yeah, it seems like Spotify has
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.800]  gotten the intelligence of, you know, music recommendations pretty well done at this point.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  Right. You know, like, I guess the two main things are playing things that you do like,
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.960]  but weren't in your mind to ask for. And like, Oh, I love this song, and be exposing you to new
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.080]  music that you that would you you might like, whereas if you only ever ask for what you like,
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.080]  or what you already know that you want to listen to right now, it's it's very different. And I'm
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.320]  not saying that that's how HomePod works. I mean, although that's how mostly how I tested it.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.400]  You know, and a big factor in that, though, is the limit the current limitation of HomePod
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.880]  only being tied to one iCloud account, which, you know, I spent a fair amount of time on my review.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:17.200]  And it's I understand it, especially for a 1.0. But it's, it certainly is obvious to me that the
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:24.720]  way this product should work is that, you know, at least in the in the size of a typical household
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:35.360]  with, you know, two, three, five people, it should be able to have five people's iCloud music accounts
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.480]  and identify them by voice and their competing products. And you know, you say, Well, you know,
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:46.880]  this isn't science fiction, but the other products already do this, you know, the Google products can
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:52.960]  identify people by voice and the Amazon and tie them to different Google accounts. So like with
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.760]  the products, you can tell it to add an event to your calendar. And it adds it to your Google
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.280]  calendar because it both recognizes your voice and knows which Google account is yours. And then I
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.840]  can ask it to add event to my calendar and it knows my voice and can add it to my calendar.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.160]  So it's not like this me ask saying that the HomePod should do this is asking for something
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.160]  outlandish. It's something that competing products do. And for building up any,
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.640]  are there any Apple devices besides the Mac that do profiles?
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.920]  No, I don't think so. Like your phone obviously doesn't your phone that makes a decent amount
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.840]  of sense. That's your device, even if you have kids or something like that. iPads are one that
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.320]  people have been, I think clamoring for for years to have profiles right from the beginning. I
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.800]  remember people saying this would be fantastic in school, but you know, why can't I have profiles?
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:49.680]  Apple TV is one where individual apps definitely have profiles. You know, if you load up Netflix,
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.960]  it'll ask you who's watching. But there's not an overarching profile where you can just say, okay,
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:01.360]  now Paul's watching now John's watching and just show me my apps or show me my recommendations or
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.320]  whatever. It seems like something that they don't do currently besides on the Mac, obviously.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.640]  Yeah, it seems like a blind spot for the company. I thought about that as an angle for the review
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:17.520]  that they're so you know, they're their roots as a quote unquote, personal computer company
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.040]  really still show through to today, right? And like with a watch, it makes all the sense in
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:29.040]  the world, you know, right. But with the TV, it makes no sense. And even with the way that
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.680]  they've changed their TV app in the last year, to make it try to make it like your hub for watching
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.480]  stuff. Exactly. From multiple sources like pick up on the show you were watching on Hulu or pick
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:50.240]  up on this other show that you're watching on Amazon Prime, or watch this new movie release
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.880]  from iTunes. It's like it's based on the aggregate viewing of everybody in your house, not on you,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.960]  which really doesn't make a lot of sense. Doesn't make any sense. Yeah. And now I'm trying to
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:10.400]  remember, oh, nine and earlier. Did that not have users? No, definitely did not. Some kind of weird
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.520]  cheaty move towards the end that was like in it. I wish Syracuse were here, but it was
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.720]  that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to go back in time 20 years at this point. But it's clearly
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:28.080]  where that's that's definitely built around individual users and you have a home folder.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.760]  And you can have 10 home folders on your computer if you have 10 people in your house and everybody
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.560]  can use the same computer. And everybody can be equal. You can even make everybody an admin.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:42.000]  It's not an admin on it. Exactly. You can't you're not even limited to Well, one person can be the
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.720]  admin and everybody else can be a, you know, non admin user, you can even grant admin privileges
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:52.640]  to everybody in the house if you want and trust them with the computer. And the non admin users
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.000]  aren't really limited from what they can do other than modifying the system software and installing
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.840]  apps and stuff like that. Right, whereas the truly is that that's, that's the big one to me that
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.320]  the TV and the iPad where these sorts of things make perfect sense, but they, it I think you're
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.840]  right. It's not in their DNA as a personal computing company. And I think you know, as 10,
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:18.000]  it sort of happened almost incidentally, because they built it on Unix. Yeah. And Netflix has a
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.160]  great interface for it. Netflix, I don't I'm not even quite sure what their algorithm is. But their
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:27.440]  algorithm seems to be, if you haven't fired up Netflix, if you've, you know, we've got three
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:31.920]  family members on one Netflix account. And, you know, you fire up the Apple TV and you fire up
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.840]  the Apple TV and you haven't watched Netflix in a while, it'll say who's watching. And there's,
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.520]  you know, the three of us and you pick who it is. And then it shows stuff based on what you've
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:46.400]  watched before. And it seems like if you if you have watched recently, it just assumes that you're
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.920]  the person who was watching recently. But if you want to, you can go back and, you know, manually
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.720]  change it to the other person. Right, if you dip out of it to go back to the home screen, it
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.200]  doesn't immediately ask you who it is again. Yeah. But after Yeah, you're right. I mean,
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.880]  yeah, you're right. I don't know what the time is. Because I've never thought about it. Because it's
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.760]  always just worked the way I expected it to. Oh, my God, it was like a year ago, I had to sit
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.040]  Jonas down and say, you know what, don't be lazy. You've got to switch this goddamn thing. Because
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.800]  my my Netflix is the worst recommendations in the world, right? It was filled up with 30 seasons of
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:29.600]  friends. I think Amy told me this like friends got big with the middle school crowd last year.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.120]  Yeah, like last year. I don't understand. It was like a nationwide craze. Jonas watched the entire
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:42.080]  series of friends from first episode to last twice. But he did like the first season of it on
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.520]  our first year of our first run through the whole thing on my Netflix account, which I honestly have
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:53.920]  no interest in, in rewatching friends. And it really, he watched a couple other stupid things,
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.600]  too. And it was all he understood it. That's the worst part. He totally understood it.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.800]  He just didn't feel like going back, you know, one level two clicks to get back to his profile.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.760]  Son of a bitch. Kids are in great. Hey, let me take a break here and thank our third and
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:15.120]  final sponsor of the show. It's our good friends at fracture. fracture is a company that you send
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:21.200]  them your photos, they print them directly on glass. And they do this. Each one is handmade
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.000]  with love and care in Gainesville, Florida from us source materials. And let me tell you something.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.320]  I've said this back in November said I think in early December, but certainly November.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:38.160]  These things make incredibly thoughtful, unique gifts. It's win win win. Because you get it's
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  you get an easy place to go to buy the gift. The person you give it to your friend, your family,
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.880]  who you give it to gets a very thoughtful gift that's much more personal than anything you could
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.640]  just buy out of a store. And they'll appreciate it. I'm telling you, people love getting these
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.080]  things. And then the best part about it is, is you can just keep going back to the well
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.440]  and giving them as gifts again and again. And again, like I've said before, like the worst
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.840]  thing about when you find if you're a bad gift giver, like I am, and you finally give somebody
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:13.200]  who you really care about a gift that they're like, and that they tear up and they're like,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.920]  this is fantastic. Thank you so much. Well, now you've got to top it, right? And you can't like,
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.440]  if it's like a store bought item, you can't just go and buy them the same thing again.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.040]  Fracture prints, when you buy them as gifts, you can just keep going back and giving them again
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.600]  and again and again. Like if you've got, you know, kids you can take pictures of or dogs or,
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.520]  you know, if you go on a vacation with certain family members every year,
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.400]  just find a couple of good photos from the annual trip and make a fracture every Mother's Day or
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:44.160]  whatever holiday is coming up. You can keep going back to the well again and again, and people don't
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.440]  they don't think twice about it. It really is fantastic as a gift. I can't emphasize that.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:55.440]  It's also great for filling your own home with pictures from your life. It really is. I can't
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.160]  say enough. And as our cameras get on our phones especially get better and better. It's like you've
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:06.160]  got all of these fantastic photos and all you ever do is look at them on a five inch screen.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:13.280]  It's almost unbelievable how good a modern iPhone picture looks when it's blown up to,
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.120]  you know, 18 inches or even bigger. It really does work. It's kind of crazy that we just look
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:26.080]  at them and flick at them at these little tiny index card size screens. It's kind of stunning
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.040]  how good they look big. You can fill up all the walls in your house with these things.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.960]  Really a great product. It comes, it's just a piece of glass. The picture is printed right on
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.920]  it edge to edge and everything you need to hang it up or display it comes in the box. They even
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:46.880]  include the wall, the wall hanger. It's a green company operating a carbon neutral factory. Visit

[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:12.560]  from survey? It helps support the show and it helps them know that their advertising money is
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.360]  being put to good use. So my thanks to fracture for their continued support of the talk show.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.960]  You've sent some fractures to us, I believe. Isn't that true?
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:29.280]  I was just thinking about that. Amy and I did an episode of Just The Tip that revolved around what
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:36.880]  we called the fracture swap. And I was wondering where those are. I sent, I believe, basically
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.720]  fracture sponsored the show and they gave us basically like a credit to send photos to one
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:49.600]  another. And she sent me one large photo and I sent her I think about five different ridiculous
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.840]  photos that then we spent half an hour laughing about. But I was wondering where those photos are
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  now. There's one of Danny DeVito's naked ass that should be hung in a prized place in your house.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.360]  They might be packed up, Paul.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.000]  I bet they didn't make it through the move. That's my guess. And I'm hurt by it. But I understand.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.480]  I believe one of them was Pete Rose, right? The all time the hit came. Absolutely.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.600]  Yeah. I'll include that one in the show notes. That was a good one. Pete Rose underwear model.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.120]  He's a handsome man. I saw Pete Rose a couple weeks ago. I was in Vegas.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.520]  How's he doing? Well, he's still signing autographs.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.080]  And what's that go for about 50 bucks a pop? I think so. It might be up to 100 depending
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:35.520]  on what you want him to sign. I think it might be a sign. Baseball might be 100 bucks.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:44.880]  Very strange. Speaking of sports, we had the we had the Super Bowl this last weekend.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.840]  Did you do you watch the Super Bowl? I did watch the Super Bowl. I'm in Boston.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:57.600]  And so, you know, it's certainly fairly mandatory to watch the Super Bowl when the local team is in.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.840]  I, I was out in Vegas for the Super Bowl, which I've done for the last few years. I don't know
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.880]  if you can hear it. My voice my I'm a little hoarse still. Do you hear it? Do you do I sound
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:15.600]  a little hoarse? You sound like you've had a weekend in Vegas. It's a bad combination
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:25.120]  because it's dry desert air. And it's really the last place I go in the world where people
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:31.040]  are still allowed to smoke cigarettes in public. I personally do not smoke. I've never really smoked.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.720]  But there's a lot of it. It you effectively pick up a cigarette habit.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.920]  So I don't know how much of it to blame on the dry desert air. I don't know how much to blame
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:49.440]  on the ambient cigarette smoke. And I don't know how much to blame on yelling and screaming during
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:56.080]  during the game. But it was it was pretty wild. It was really I would honestly, in hindsight,
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.520]  though, as time goes on, you end an exciting game, you know, like, you know, last year's game had a
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.200]  very exciting finish. And it had a very exciting finish. And it had a very exciting finish.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.920]  And it had sort of a stunning fourth quarter. And you come out of it thinking, my God, that was an
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.120]  extraordinary game. And then as the time settles on you, you it settles in and you're like, well,
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.960]  it was certainly an extraordinary fourth quarter. But it wasn't really an exciting game. The first
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:28.960]  three quarters were actually rather unexciting. You're talking about last year's last year Super
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.560]  Bowl when the blowout for most of the game and then yeah, the Atlanta Falcons ran up a 28 to
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.200]  three lead on the New England Patriots until late in the third quarter. I believe I believe
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.920]  the third quarter finished 28 to 10. And so they still had an 18 point lead going into the fourth
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:51.040]  quarter, but they were had been up 25 points in the late in the third quarter. And then everything
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:57.200]  went to hell for the Atlanta Falcons. Whereas this year's Super Bowl was truly and in hindsight,
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:04.480]  I really I even in a moment, it felt like it was terribly exciting throughout. It was certainly
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.400]  terribly exciting for me as somebody with a large, large wager on the Philadelphia Eagles.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.000]  Were you one of the million dollar bets? I was not one of the million dollar bets. We were talking
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.720]  about that. That is crazy that I know they said there were about a half dozen. And I think most
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:24.720]  more of them at least were for the Eagles. That was the consensus for those people. But well,
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.520]  it word comes around. It's like you're you're when you're in Vegas for the Super Bowl weekend.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.800]  It's just like it. Who knows what's true and what's not? It's not like you go into the sports
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:39.360]  book where you place the bets and there's like a light up sign that says someone just placed a
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:45.600]  million dollar bet. But there's some kind of weird certainty that runs around where it's like
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.840]  somebody somebody will say, I heard somebody dropped a million dollars on the Eagles. And then
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.000]  you're like, really? And then somebody will say, Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard it from my, you know, my
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.600]  you know, my guy at the casino, you know, like his casino host or something like that.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:03.040]  What do you think the mechanics of dropping a million dollar bet on?
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.480]  I we couldn't figure it out. Like you don't just want you How do you back that bet up? Right. I
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.200]  when I placed my bet, which I could called and considered and certainly felt in my heart
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:20.240]  throughout the game, a quote unquote, large bet. My bet was placed with cash. I certainly couldn't
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:26.560]  do that with a million dollars. So you know, you could I mean, a million bucks is like that's a
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.600]  suitcase worth, I think. Yeah, I don't think that that's what people are doing. I believe that you
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.040]  would have to set up some kind of a line of credit with the casino and and maybe do a wire transfer
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:43.280]  or something like that to an account. And then I don't know what it probably is. I think they just
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:50.000]  write a check. That's it. Well, I mean, this is America, you can just write a million dollar check
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.440]  and hand it to them. And they'll walk it over to the bank. You've now you've you've you've been in
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.760]  Vegas with me and you've you've placed sports wagers before and you and when a normal punter
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:06.560]  like us goes up and you maybe maybe you would like to bet a hundred dollars preseason on the
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.680]  Red Sox to win the World Series. And it'll pay I don't know what the current odds are. I'll bet it
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.640]  some I bet a Red Sox ticket right now off the top of my head probably pays eight to one or nine to
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.600]  one something like a thousand bucks. You could play, you know, put one hundred dollars down and
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.240]  then they'll print out a little ticket. And it's it's like almost like a receipt. It's a little
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:32.000]  white piece of paper with that heat type printing on it. Right. Thermal printed. It's super high
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.560]  quality. Right. And then there's like a little the equivalent of a QR code at the bottom and it
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.480]  tell you you bet one hundred dollars at nine to one. And then you can hold that until the World
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:45.680]  Series is over. And if you win, you can either fly back to Vegas and cash it in or you can mail
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.880]  it in and they'll they'll send you a check for your nine hundred dollars. I'm going to guess
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:55.760]  when you place a million dollar bet, they don't just print out a little thermal printed slip of
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:03.760]  paper. But I would love to know what they do print. Right. What what do they do? And just
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.320]  think about things. Think about this. Let's say I go out and I bet a thousand dollars on the Eagles
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:16.640]  and the game is over and the Eagles have won. But I've got a flight to catch. I could just
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:21.520]  hand you the ticket and I'll just say, Paul, just send me that thousand bucks. And I'm I'm off in
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.920]  a cab to the airport and you can walk right up to the counter and hand it over. And then right.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.000]  There's no verification. Just having possession of the ticket is all you need. They'll just pay you
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:34.320]  the the thing. I'm going to guess you can't do that with a million dollar
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.920]  bet on this. I think I think it's like a bearer bond. You know, whoever has possession of that
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:43.840]  slip of paper, it's worth a million bucks now. And that's it. And actually, I guess that's the
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.160]  question. Was it was it a million dollar? Were the bets? Did they put down a million dollars?
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.800]  And then how much did they win? Well, there's different ways to bet. So the two ways to bet
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:59.200]  on the game, if you take the point spread and then this game, the Patriots are favored by four
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.560]  and the that if you bet on the Eagles on the point spread, you could add four and a half points to
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:09.440]  the final score in terms of the Eagles could have lost by up to four points. Right. So if the
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:14.800]  Patriots had won by three or even four, they would have won the Super Bowl and they would have been
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:20.480]  very happy. But if you bet on the the Patriots, you would be unhappy because you would have lost.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.360]  And then the other thing you do is they call it the money line, where instead of any point
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:30.800]  spread, it's you bet on the team that wins. And the way that it's adjusted for who's favored
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:38.800]  and who's the underdog is it pays different odds. If I recall correctly from Sunday, the Eagles,
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:43.760]  I know what the Eagles went off at. The Eagles were called were at plus 165. And that means
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:51.280]  a money line bet on the Eagles for $100 if they won would pay $165. So however much you want to
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:58.000]  bet on it, you'd multiply it by 1.65. And that's your payout. And the Patriots were the other way.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.160]  I believe that when the game started, they were at minus 190, meaning you had to bet $190
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:13.280]  to win just $100 if the Patriots won. And that's right. So if you bet a million dollars on the
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:19.440]  Eagles at 165, you would get back 2.65 million. Is that right? That is correct, because you would
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.920]  give them when you place the bet, you give them the money. So they they've already got your
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:31.600]  million dollars. And it's sort of like an escrow. We're by escrow, I mean, in you know, the casinos,
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.720]  in the vault in the vault. And then when it wins, you go over there with your little thermal ticket,
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:45.200]  and they'll pay you. And the ticket will say you've bet a million to pay 2.65 million to win
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:51.040]  1.65 million. You give it to them, and then they'll sit there and count out 2.65 million
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:53:00.080]  in $100 bills. Sure. I don't know why we didn't do this. It sounds like loads of fun. And you
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:04.640]  wouldn't have been at all nervous when the Pats threw a Hail Mary at the end of the game.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:13.200]  I was dying because it seemed like exactly the sort of play that they would make. It really
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:19.920]  did. Make the completion, get the two-point conversion, go to OT, win by six. Right. With
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:23.920]  another touchdown, just like last year. Yeah. Well, so this is interesting, though. I mentioned
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.520]  we should talk about this because you live in Philly and I live in New England, but you're a
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.440]  Cowboys fan. That is correct. So if anything, I mean, you said you placed a bet on the Eagles,
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.560]  so I guess you're rooting for the Eagles. But if anything, you should be rooting against the Eagles.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:40.720]  I know I have plenty of friends who are Giants fans who were rooting for the Pats,
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.680]  which felt weird to them. Well, I remember specifically, it's funny, the last time the
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.440]  Eagles were in the Super Bowl, I don't remember the year. I think it was 2006, though. I could
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:56.480]  be wrong. 2005? It was against the Pats, right? Against the Pats. And I've never been a fan of
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.480]  the Patriots. I was a bit ambivalent about that game. I don't remember which way my gut swung,
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:06.560]  but it wasn't very hard in either direction because I don't like the Eagles because they're
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:13.120]  a division rival of the Cowboys. And as a Cowboys fan in Philadelphia, I have numerous friends who
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:21.120]  we have a friendly rivalry about that issue with. And I don't like the Patriots because they cheat.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:30.080]  And to be honest, I really don't like the Patriots because as a Cowboys fan, what I really like about
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:37.120]  the Cowboys is that they are a historically great team and that they've won five Super Bowls. And
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:44.640]  I would like for the Cowboys to be the team that has the most Super Bowl victories. But right now,
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.040]  the Cowboys have been stuck at five since, I don't know, I was like 20 years old. It's been
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.960]  a long time. They're in a very long extended rut, stuck at five. I believe when they last won...
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.320]  94, right? No, 95 or 96, 96, I think.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:06.000]  I think they won in 93, 95 and 96. No, no, no. They won back to back years because that's where
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.520]  I was going with this, was that they played the Bills two years in a row. And they had the blowout
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.840]  against... So I mentioned my parents are from Buffalo. So I grew up a Bills fan and had the
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:21.920]  love of football just beaten right out of me because the Bills lost to the Giants, to the
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:27.920]  Washington Redskins, to the Cowboys in the biggest blowout in history. And then I was actually at
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:34.800]  Super Bowl XXVIII, which was in 94, I'm pretty sure, and watched them lose their fourth Super
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:41.520]  Bowl in a row. Right. Which is astounding. I mean, it's an incredible feat. I'd probably never be
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:46.480]  equaled. Just getting to four Super Bowls in a row is tremendous. In a league, in any league,
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.920]  it would be impressive. But in the NFL in particular, you tend to have teams
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.880]  come out of nowhere to get to the Super Bowl and then drop out of the Super Bowl and be nowhere
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:01.680]  the next year. So this past weekend, we had you, a Philadelphia resident who likes the Cowboys,
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.560]  who was sort of cheering for the Eagles. I was all in on the Eagles. I was all in in this case
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.560]  because the Patriots have only extended their argument to be the greatest team of all time.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:18.000]  So I need that to stop. You want that to stop. I want that to stop. And I just generally find
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.120]  them to be unlikable people. I really do. It was noted after the game that when the game was over,
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.640]  Tom Brady didn't go to the midfield to shake hands with the Eagles quarterback, Nick Foles. He just
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:36.960]  went right to the locker room. I don't think that's a huge deal. He just lost a heartbreaker.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:42.080]  Who knows? I might do that. I'm a very poor loser, to be honest. Honestly, I might do the same thing.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.640]  I wouldn't want to go shake somebody's hand. But this rubs me the wrong way.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.400]  But this rubs me the wrong way. I don't know. I don't like them. And I happen to,
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:54.160]  even as a Cowboys fan who generally is predisposed to just like anybody,
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.880]  any other team from the NFC East, this particular Eagles team this year is extraordinarily likable.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.280]  I said it to Maltz last week that they've got these guys who are just just likable guys. I mean,
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.280]  the one guy donated his whole salary to local schools. I mean, how do you not love that?
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.760]  I mean, it's just like, boy, that just seems like it. And they're just doing great things in the
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:18.320]  city. They've been doing it since before this really reached a fever pitch. But they're
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.480]  they're just really good guys. And they sold all those dog masks. So I mean, that's good for
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:29.680]  somebody. So anyway, we had to record today because tomorrow we're we're having a parade
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.560]  here in Philadelphia. And by whereby parade, it pretty much means the entire city is shut down.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.800]  I mean, like literally like they're they're shutting the city down tonight.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:44.080]  And I don't think there are the schools closed schools are closed, man. They're not even
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.280]  pretending that kids are going to school. It's no school. Schools are closed, which is really kind
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.480]  of awesome, honestly. I mean, it's Jonas has never been more interested in sports than when he found
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:58:01.440]  out that that he gets out of a day off of school. Yeah. But and, you know, I just don't think people
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:07.360]  people don't realize it's, you know, it really means a lot to the city. It's a city that hasn't
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:12.240]  had a championship team since the 2008 Phillies. And prior to the 2008 Phillies, I said this last
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:19.120]  week, I should have 25 years before that it was the 83 Sixers. And that's a lot. 83 to 2008 sounds
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:25.520]  like a long time. And from 83 until Sunday, only have one sneak in the middle was the Phillies. It's
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.840]  you know, it's been a long time. And but of all the teams in the city, the one that's the most
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.080]  beloved is the Eagles without question. I don't think there's anybody it doesn't matter how big
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.040]  a Sixers fan or Phillies fan or even certainly Flyers fan that you might be. No one would argue
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.600]  that this isn't an Eagles town. And there's nothing they want more than to win a Super Bowl.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:50.800]  And they went 50 52 Super Bowls and only made it to two and lost both. So people went nuts. And
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:57.920]  to have them win it in quite arguably, the most extraordinary Super Bowl game in history
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:02.880]  is just icing on the cake. I mean, and again, I know there's probably some people have already
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:07.120]  stopped the show, but that's all right. But if you're into it, it's it's mathematically it's
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:13.520]  extraordinary that in the it's not in the history of the Super Bowl, which is 52 games, or the
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:20.960]  history of the playoffs in the NFL, which is I guess, 1000 or so games in the history of the NFL,
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:26.720]  every game that has ever been played in the National Football League. The game on Sunday
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.880]  had the most total yardage ever. And it was by a long shot broke the record in the third quarter.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:37.840]  In the third quarter, they had already racked up more total yardage between both offenses
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:44.560]  than any game in the NFL. And when I was watching, I was watching in this big, big room in Vegas in a
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.120]  casino filled with, I don't know, a couple 1000 people in all of these big jumbotrons and
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:54.800]  real noisy. That's why that that's so noisy that that's why I think I'm half the reason I'm horse.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:59.360]  But everybody was just sort of looking at each other, like in the third quarter, like when it
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:04.880]  when the halftime, the first half was terribly exciting. And then you got the big long halftime
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:08.560]  show. And then the third quarter starts up and third quarter just takes it up a notch on both
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:13.840]  sides. And neither team every time every team touches the ball, they score. And everybody was
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:17.920]  just sort of looking at each other saying like, Am I nuts? Am I am I drunk? What am I doing?
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.160]  Am I am I drunk? What's going on? This is this is like crazy, right? This is crazy.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.960]  And when they came up with that stat that this was the most yardage in any game, not any playoff game,
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:31.360]  any game ever, and we're only in the third quarter, and it's the it's the Super Bowl,
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.120]  which is often a very defensive game. We were like, Okay, this is crazy.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:39.840]  Well, that was the thing. Nobody was playing defense. I mean, if you if you like defensive
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:45.280]  football, this was not a very good game at all. Right. That's my theory. My, my fundamental
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:50.240]  theory over all the stats I saw were that like, sorry, go ahead. Well, my fundamental theory is
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:55.040]  that this is that's where football is going is to be a more basketball like game. Meaning
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.520]  just constant scoring. Yeah, constant scoring and and much faster, faster pace.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.680]  Both I was gonna say all the all the stats I saw were about it was about the pats and how they're,
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.960]  you know, they got over 600 yards. And that's the only time anyone has ever lost a game doing that.
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:16.880]  And, you know, they've got they got all these great records, except for the fact that they
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.960]  lost this game. Right. So Brady personally had 500 500 plus yards passing and three touchdowns
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:28.160]  and no interceptions and no quarterback who's ever done that again in every single game
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.040]  that league has ever played for like, roughly 100 years, probably about 90 years.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.720]  Every game that's ever happened, anytime a quarterback has done that they've won the game
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.320]  because you would think, well, they how could you lose? Right. But you can lose your defense
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:49.360]  was just slightly worse than the other team's defense. And the other team only had one time
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.960]  that they touched the ball that they didn't score. Both teams I believe had one time they
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.800]  touched the ball that didn't score one time the Eagles punted and then at the end of the game
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:02.080]  towards the end of the game. One time Brady got hit and fumbled. Yeah, I think that's I know they
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.640]  didn't. I know they didn't punt. So that sounds right. Why? Usually when you want it historically,
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.720]  at least when you watch the Super Bowl, you think, my God, it's hard to score in this league.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.640]  You either have to do something crazy or you got to get a lucky break or whatever. And there's
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.480]  times where it's like, punt, punt, punt. You're like, my God, there's no way. How does anybody
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:26.000]  score in this game? Whereas in that game, it was like, does the other team even have 11 men
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:34.720]  on the field? Well, congratulations to the city of Philadelphia. Oh, it's going to be something.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:41.760]  Hopefully the city stands up to this. I guess they're greasing the polls again. I heard that
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.080]  they were not going to grease the polls. I think I told Moltz last week they were going to stop
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.320]  because the idea was that they Chris code up the polls. We have a tradition here in town where
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:58.560]  when a Philadelphia team wins, the fans will climb up the street polls for whatever reason.
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:07.280]  That's what you do. Well, the cops to, I don't know, fight against this because they don't want
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:15.760]  to prevent it. They greased them up with Crisco before the Vikings came and it didn't stop them.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:19.600]  And then you're the one who sent me the link that they, what'd you say? They're training for this.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.320]  That in South Philadelphia, it's a tradition like on certain holidays during like an Italian
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:29.920]  festival or something that they grease. They themselves grease the polls and then they have
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.960]  a contest. They put something on top of the pole, grease it, and then everybody tries to climb it.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:40.960]  So yeah, they're training for this event. And so that didn't work. They Chris code up the polls
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.320]  and people climbed them anyway. And so the word was, they're not going to Chris go on up again.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.600]  But what they did is they replaced it with some sort of industrial grease. I don't know how much
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.680]  better. It was like some kind of oil or something. Yeah. Well, so did it work though? I saw a bunch
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.160]  of street poles on the ground. I don't know if that was from climbing or just destruction in
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:03.760]  general. Yeah, maybe people getting angry that they were so well greased up where it's like,
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.400]  well, if I can't climb it, I'm going to take it down. I might as well knock it over. I don't know
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.720]  how you do that. I really don't. I saw there were a couple of street poles knocked over. And I
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.640]  guess if you just get a couple people rocking it back and forth, you can do it. But it certainly,
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:21.360]  you know, I've walked by and just given them a knock this week. And it certainly seems like most
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.280]  of them are pretty sturdy. So it's pretty impressive. Hopefully, the parade will go off. All
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:32.480]  right. And is it it doesn't go by your house? Does it? Did you say it goes by Jonas's school?
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:41.440]  It does. Right by the school? Yeah. He might not have a school come Friday. Yes. He's the
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.280]  luckiest kid in the world. That's what he's not only does he get a day off, he gets the whole rest
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.600]  of the year off. Yeah, he's rooting for chaos. We're nearby at Center City, Philadelphia is very,
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.720]  very small. Given the size of Philadelphia proper Center City, Philadelphia is very small. So we're
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:05:00.720]  clear nearby. We could walk we have a couple of choices of which way to go. But I think I think
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.760]  our house will be all right. I don't know. Anything else you wanted to talk about Paul?
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:14.160]  Now, I think we covered it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much you you get into the politics,
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:19.600]  but I did have I did a quick interview that I thought maybe we could just real quick touch on.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:25.520]  And, you know, you know, feel free to cut this out. But I was able to reach my good pal Barry
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:33.440]  Oboms. And I got his take on the current president of the United States. And it's just a five second
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.520]  take. I don't know if you'd like to hear what Barry Oboms thinks of President Donald Trump.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:43.120]  Now, you know, that guy ain't shit. Sorry motherfucker got nothing on me. Right? Nothing.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.760]  Right. Nothing. You know, it's from the heart. He spoke so
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:55.520]  letting it fly. Let out there telling it as it is.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:03.440]  My thanks to Paul and his his sidekick for ago over there. I've got some links. I promise
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:08.800]  they'll be in the show notes. There's a great designing for ago. story on the the rogue amoeba
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:16.320]  blog talking about the design of it to terrific app hope it does very well. And I'm not sure what
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.480]  to say. It's like I almost wish that the Patriots had gotten blown out. I could stick it to you. I
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:28.480]  feel like there's something noble in a five time championship team also having the single greatest
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:33.760]  performance and indisputably the single greatest performance in a loss in Super Bowl loss. Yeah.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:39.760]  Right. Like there's there's some way to measure. Like when you count the greatness of teams in all
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:43.760]  times, certain losses are better than others. You know what I mean? Like your Buffalo Bills,
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:49.760]  the time that they lost on a wide right kick at the last second by two points. Well, that counts
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:54.240]  for something different than when the Cowboys beat them 55 to 10 or whatever the hell the score was.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:59.120]  That's what it was. It was 55 to 10. So I would say scoring a touchdown every time you have the
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:07.360]  ball except once and then still scoring a minute later, almost scoring a minute later certainly
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:13.440]  counts for something. There's something certainly it's certainly a noble loss. Oh, did you see the
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.920]  crazy thing before we sign off? You see the crazy thing with the offensive coordinator on the the
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:24.080]  pats? Yeah, Josh McDaniel. So Josh McDaniel had agreed he was supposed to go to Indy and be their
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:29.440]  head coach and had gotten so far that they had already scheduled a charter plane to take him
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:34.640]  there today for the big introduction. And he'd already signed a bunch of assistant coaches who
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:39.920]  quit their jobs at other teams and had already been signed and are under contract for next year.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:46.560]  And somehow Belichick and team owner Bob Kraft said, hey, maybe you want to stay?
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:54.640]  Hey. And he said, OK, Indianapolis, never mind. It's a real it's a real kick in the pants for
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:59.600]  the Colts, but, you know, they deserve whatever they get for stealing the team in the first place.
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:04.720]  So whatever. Yeah, it's sort of like I kind of had the same thought there where it's kind of
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:08.240]  what you get. Anybody who doesn't know the back story on that, the Indianapolis Colts,
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:12.320]  long story short, in turn, we want to think like, hey, I feel that doesn't sound right,
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.160]  that a team would lose their their new coach like that. But what happened with the Indianapolis
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:21.760]  Colts was they were the Baltimore Colts, the beloved Baltimore Colts for decades.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:28.320]  And the team owner, Art, what was his name, Modell, Art Modell, for whatever reason,
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.120]  decided he would move the team to Indianapolis and knew it wouldn't be popular. And so he had
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:37.440]  a bunch of moving trucks show up literally in the middle of the night in Baltimore and moved
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:43.200]  everything out of their stadium in the middle of the night and drove it all to Indianapolis
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.880]  and then announced it there that they were leaving the city of Baltimore.
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:53.440]  Needless to say, did not did not go well in in Baltimore. I forget if it was Art Modell
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:58.160]  was the owner. Art Modell was the wrong man. He was he's the one that eventually got the Ravens.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:02.400]  He's the Browns, right? The Browns owner. Exactly. All right. Sorry. It was Bob Ursay.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.320]  It was the father of the current owner. That's right. That's right. Ursay. Right.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:11.360]  So they got exactly what they deserved. Modell's the guy who screwed the Cleveland over,
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:15.840]  not not screwed Baltimore over. Well, but he didn't screw Cleveland over the way Baltimore
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:19.200]  got screwed over, because when when they left Cleveland, Cleveland knew they were getting
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.120]  a team back. Yeah. Yeah. In like two years or something. And that they would get to keep the
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:27.600]  name. The Browns name. Exactly. He didn't steal. That's exactly right. He didn't steal the Browns
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.880]  name. Right. And he took the team. And when you have a storied success like the Cleveland Browns.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:40.800]  Like the Cleveland Browns. Where the only good thing in your team's history was the great
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:47.680]  Jim Brown, who so hated the team owner that while he was indisputably the single greatest player
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:55.920]  active in the league, he quit so he could just go make action movies. When that's the finest
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:00.320]  achievement your franchise has ever achieved, you certainly want to keep that name and brand.
