[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  How are you liking it over there?
[00:01.880 --> 00:02.600]  It's awesome.
[00:02.600 --> 00:05.120]  It's great.
[00:05.120 --> 00:05.560]  It's fun.
[00:05.560 --> 00:10.080]  I mean, it's hard, but it's been really good.
[00:10.080 --> 00:12.720]  Well, this is a busy time for you guys because it's
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.680]  like a busy time of the year period
[00:14.680 --> 00:17.280]  because it's like May and June is
[00:17.280 --> 00:19.320]  like when everybody in tech wants to,
[00:19.320 --> 00:21.800]  if they're launching anything, they're doing it now.
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.080]  Like, you've got to get it out before July and August.
[00:25.080 --> 00:27.120]  And you guys have a big conference that just got
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.240]  wrapped up, right?
[00:28.240 --> 00:32.760]  Yeah, which was my third time attending it,
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.520]  but my first time working it.
[00:34.520 --> 00:38.160]  And totally different experience.
[00:38.160 --> 00:39.960]  I mean, it is an amazing conference.
[00:39.960 --> 00:43.680]  It's probably, obviously, it's different than something
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.720]  like WWDC or CES.
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.160]  But as far as executive conferences go in tech
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.040]  that the public is invited, well, sort of invited to,
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.240]  I think it's the best one.
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.440]  Well, the history clearly dates to when
[00:59.440 --> 01:01.280]  it was called All Things D. I mean,
[01:01.280 --> 01:05.720]  it's Kara and Walt and the big red chairs.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.880]  And it was basically the only conference
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.920]  that Steve Jobs went to besides Macworld
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.760]  and whatever Apple would put on.
[01:13.760 --> 01:17.160]  Right, and the big difference is that when
[01:17.160 --> 01:19.880]  Apple puts on a keynote, it's not really a conference.
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.320]  Here's everything we have to say, and it's prepared.
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.160]  And on stage there, it's Walt and Kara asking the questions.
[01:28.160 --> 01:28.920]  Right, totally.
[01:28.920 --> 01:32.480]  Yeah, the difference in preparedness
[01:32.480 --> 01:36.040]  and who kind of lays out what they talk about and all that.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.840]  But it was great.
[01:37.840 --> 01:45.480]  Actually, watching the videos now, I kind of wonder,
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.360]  man, what if Jobs were still here?
[01:47.360 --> 01:49.920]  What would he be talking about?
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.640]  It kind of ruins the mood.
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.080]  But watching Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk,
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.560]  just really, really exciting and really interesting.
[02:00.560 --> 02:01.560]  Yeah, it's a great list.
[02:01.560 --> 02:03.840]  I mean, I would say it's pretty hard
[02:03.840 --> 02:05.960]  to top in today's executive world,
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.120]  a one-two punch of Bezos and Elon Musk.
[02:09.120 --> 02:11.400]  Yeah, it was great because Bezos kind of
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.040]  has taken the role of the elder statesman
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.880]  almost as far as CEOs who are still really, really involved
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.960]  in the day-to-day and would talk not only at length
[02:23.960 --> 02:25.880]  about the products that their companies make,
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.480]  but just kind of the bigger picture
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.680]  in general, which is kind of the role that Jobs would do.
[02:30.680 --> 02:33.640]  He would talk not only in detail about how
[02:33.640 --> 02:35.400]  Apple thinks, but also just kind of what's
[02:35.400 --> 02:37.560]  going on in the world.
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.720]  And if you haven't had a chance to watch the full videos,
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.520]  80 minutes of Jeff Bezos talking to Walt Mossberg,
[02:45.520 --> 02:48.240]  and then the other one was, I believe,
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.400]  over an hour of Kara Swisher and Walt interviewing Elon Musk.
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.120]  They're all available for free on Recode.
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.840]  You should check them out.
[02:57.840 --> 02:59.760]  It's really interesting.
[02:59.760 --> 03:02.600]  And meanwhile, Musk kind of has played this role
[03:02.600 --> 03:09.520]  as the wacky guy in a spacesuit, basically, who half of the talk
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.280]  was a physical lesson, and the other half
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.840]  was, let's pretend that we're inside of a video game.
[03:19.840 --> 03:20.600]  I don't know.
[03:20.600 --> 03:22.240]  It was crazy, and it was super fun.
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.640]  And that one came at the end of, for me, a 16-hour day.
[03:27.640 --> 03:29.400]  Yeah, that might be a little mind-blowing
[03:29.400 --> 03:32.560]  to have Elon Musk up there speculating on whether.
[03:32.560 --> 03:35.360]  I mean, the idea was that it's not like he's the first person.
[03:35.360 --> 03:37.640]  I mean, anybody who ever smoked a little weed in college
[03:37.640 --> 03:44.040]  had the same, you could go down that rabbit hole pretty easily.
[03:44.040 --> 03:46.080]  But I mean, it's a serious question
[03:46.080 --> 03:48.680]  that actual scientists have pondered is,
[03:48.680 --> 03:50.840]  is the universe as we perceive it?
[03:50.840 --> 03:54.240]  Could it be a computer simulation
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.680]  of some kind of super advanced civilization?
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.120]  Right, and I think his answer was
[04:01.120 --> 04:03.200]  like, there's a one in billion chance
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.440]  that we're not in a simulation.
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.000]  Yeah, I have to say, I disagree with that.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.880]  I kind of feel, I kind of lean towards the Occam's razor
[04:11.880 --> 04:14.560]  explanation that, no, this probably is it.
[04:17.960 --> 04:19.160]  I don't want to, you know, I think
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.080]  people should watch it, because it's
[04:20.080 --> 04:21.840]  interesting to see a smart guy riff on this.
[04:21.840 --> 04:22.280]  It really is.
[04:22.280 --> 04:23.720]  So I'm not trying to discourage people
[04:23.720 --> 04:24.560]  from actually watching it.
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.880]  I promise, I promise to put the links to those two
[04:26.880 --> 04:27.960]  videos in the show notes.
[04:27.960 --> 04:30.560]  They really are worth watching.
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.360]  I think that the argument that there's
[04:32.360 --> 04:34.680]  an infinitesimally small chance that this
[04:34.680 --> 04:40.120]  is the real universe is that if you assume that computers are
[04:40.120 --> 04:41.720]  going to keep getting faster at the rate
[04:41.720 --> 04:43.840]  that they've gotten faster, you know,
[04:43.840 --> 04:45.920]  and that civilization is going to,
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.880]  you know, we're not going to destroy ourselves,
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.960]  eventually we're going to have computers that could simulate
[04:51.960 --> 04:54.760]  something as complex as the universe.
[04:54.760 --> 04:57.600]  And they're going to have, you know,
[04:57.600 --> 04:59.120]  and there are going to be billions
[04:59.120 --> 05:01.520]  of those simulations.
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.240]  So if any civilization got to this level of technology
[05:05.240 --> 05:08.600]  first, then the odds are that of all the things that
[05:08.600 --> 05:11.400]  are as complex as the universe, that we're
[05:11.400 --> 05:13.600]  in the one that's actually real is very small.
[05:13.600 --> 05:15.440]  Do you think that's fair paraphrasing?
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.560]  Yeah, that's basically what he said.
[05:19.560 --> 05:22.120]  Which, you know, I mean, we wouldn't know, would we?
[05:22.120 --> 05:26.720]  But it's interesting.
[05:26.720 --> 05:29.080]  I guess we wouldn't know, would we?
[05:29.080 --> 05:29.760]  I don't know.
[05:29.760 --> 05:31.440]  They figured it out in the matrix.
[05:31.440 --> 05:33.200]  That's true.
[05:33.200 --> 05:33.720]  That's true.
[05:33.720 --> 05:38.480]  We just need a Nokia phone and some pills, I guess.
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.560]  I think that one of the things that makes these two
[05:40.560 --> 05:42.720]  guys interesting, and it's one of the things that,
[05:42.720 --> 05:45.560]  I mean, Jobs was just a compelling figure, period.
[05:45.560 --> 05:48.320]  And I think there's even like a term for it,
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.960]  but it's not just the fact that they're CEOs,
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.680]  and it's not just the fact that they run interesting companies,
[05:54.680 --> 05:57.400]  and it's not just the fact that they have their interesting
[05:57.400 --> 05:58.760]  minds and they come up, you know,
[05:58.760 --> 06:00.440]  they say interesting things, but it's
[06:00.440 --> 06:02.560]  that they're the founders of the company,
[06:02.560 --> 06:06.040]  that CEO founder has a certain magic.
[06:06.040 --> 06:08.560]  And maybe there's no real, maybe it shouldn't,
[06:08.560 --> 06:10.680]  maybe that's not quite logical, maybe that's
[06:10.680 --> 06:15.760]  sort of a lizard brain aspect of human perception,
[06:15.760 --> 06:22.880]  but that somehow there's a gravitas to a CEO founder
[06:22.880 --> 06:27.800]  that, say, Tim Cook is never going to have.
[06:27.800 --> 06:34.640]  Yeah, and I don't know if that's because they're a founder
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.800]  or because they're still CEO, but maybe just because they're
[06:38.800 --> 06:42.520]  the type of person that would be the founder of something
[06:42.520 --> 06:45.480]  truly successful and big.
[06:45.480 --> 06:48.920]  And I think it's kind of interesting in comparison
[06:48.920 --> 06:52.960]  to many of today's CEOs who make cool things
[06:52.960 --> 06:56.920]  and then kind of escape, quit the company,
[06:56.920 --> 06:59.440]  or something like that.
[06:59.440 --> 07:01.480]  Not only are they still there, but they're
[07:01.480 --> 07:05.400]  using their power and influence in really interesting
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.840]  and creative and productive ways.
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.520]  In Bezos' case, doing space research
[07:12.520 --> 07:17.120]  and starting new companies and buying one of the nation's most
[07:17.120 --> 07:21.920]  storied newspapers, Musk too, basically creating,
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.600]  now creating free startup ideas for everyone
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.280]  every couple of years, like the Hyperloop.
[07:27.280 --> 07:30.840]  And now, what was he talking about?
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.840]  The mesh that goes in your brain and lets you,
[07:34.840 --> 07:36.520]  I forgot what it's called.
[07:36.520 --> 07:38.840]  Yeah, he lost me there.
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.160]  Yeah.
[07:40.160 --> 07:41.640]  I believe him.
[07:41.640 --> 07:43.520]  Right.
[07:43.520 --> 07:44.800]  But it's cool.
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.600]  I really liked it.
[07:46.600 --> 07:50.240]  And you could also, so we also had Sundar Pichai,
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.720]  which in the same vein as Cook, he's
[07:53.720 --> 07:56.680]  the CEO of one of the most powerful companies
[07:56.680 --> 07:59.080]  in the world.
[07:59.080 --> 08:01.240]  He's an interesting guy, but doesn't
[08:01.240 --> 08:04.240]  carry the same weight as Bezos.
[08:04.240 --> 08:07.040]  And then Bill and Melinda Gates, and you
[08:07.040 --> 08:09.480]  can really tell that Bill is no longer thinking
[08:09.480 --> 08:15.040]  as the CEO of Microsoft, but as a world leading philanthropist
[08:15.040 --> 08:19.640]  and is really actively much more interested in science
[08:19.640 --> 08:25.560]  and medicine than the nuts and bolts of technology
[08:25.560 --> 08:26.560]  and the internet.
[08:26.560 --> 08:27.040]  Yeah.
[08:30.520 --> 08:33.480]  Something interesting too, and I don't know if it's coincidence
[08:33.480 --> 08:35.560]  or if there's really something to it, to the fact
[08:35.560 --> 08:39.840]  that Bezos and Musk are in fact directly competing
[08:39.840 --> 08:46.320]  in terms of having space rocket ship startups,
[08:46.320 --> 08:48.680]  trying to privatize space exploration, something
[08:48.680 --> 08:52.800]  that had previously been entirely a government
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.040]  overseeing endeavor.
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.960]  Elon Musk has SpaceX.
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.480]  And what's Bezos' rock?
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.520]  I think it's Blue Origin.
[09:00.520 --> 09:00.840]  Is that maybe?
[09:00.840 --> 09:01.520]  Yeah, that's it.
[09:01.520 --> 09:04.800]  That's it, Blue Origin.
[09:04.800 --> 09:06.440]  I don't know if that's a coincidence.
[09:06.440 --> 09:12.480]  I don't know if that's just a factor of a couple of guys born
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.080]  in the 60s when space, as young boys with an interest
[09:19.080 --> 09:21.720]  in technology, how could you not be obsessed with space?
[09:21.720 --> 09:25.120]  And that if you ever got successful enough
[09:25.120 --> 09:28.120]  to be in the position to do it, it's inevitable that they would.
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.280]  Or is there something to it, like is this really
[09:30.280 --> 09:33.440]  going to be a thing in the next 10, 15 years?
[09:33.440 --> 09:36.560]  Yeah, I think it's some of both.
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.520]  I think if you have essentially unlimited money, what's
[09:41.520 --> 09:46.720]  bigger than trying to leave the planet?
[09:46.720 --> 09:49.120]  It's hard to imagine bigger things than that.
[09:49.120 --> 09:51.600]  But I do think a lot of it has to do with when they grew up.
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.160]  I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg has much interest in space,
[09:57.160 --> 09:58.560]  for example.
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.480]  He might, I don't know.
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.040]  And I don't know if that is just because of who he is.
[10:03.040 --> 10:04.760]  Our sample set is pretty small here.
[10:04.760 --> 10:06.680]  But it is interesting coincidence
[10:06.680 --> 10:09.680]  that the two of them are so into it,
[10:09.680 --> 10:11.840]  or maybe not a coincidence.
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.040]  It's certainly interesting.
[10:13.040 --> 10:13.760]  I don't know.
[10:13.760 --> 10:14.880]  Do you want to go to space?
[10:21.520 --> 10:22.800]  I have late-breaking news.
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.680]  I have late-breaking news.
[10:23.680 --> 10:24.880]  I have to interrupt the show.
[10:24.880 --> 10:27.240]  This is big news.
[10:27.240 --> 10:29.800]  My wife just came into the office while I'm recording.
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.640]  I knew that must have been a big deal.
[10:32.640 --> 10:39.200]  She found my missing canisters for the fizzy machine.
[10:39.200 --> 10:41.040]  Where were they?
[10:41.040 --> 10:41.520]  Amy!
[10:44.160 --> 10:44.800]  We're going to do it.
[10:44.800 --> 10:45.920]  We're going to reveal it on the show.
[10:45.920 --> 10:46.480]  Where were they?
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.080]  It's not funny.
[10:50.080 --> 10:50.880]  Well, where were they?
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.440]  Or fun.
[10:52.400 --> 10:54.240]  They were in the coat closet.
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.680]  Somebody put them in a milk crate in the back.
[10:58.640 --> 11:00.400]  I don't know who would do such a thing.
[11:00.400 --> 11:00.900]  You?
[11:03.440 --> 11:05.200]  And one of them fell on the floor.
[11:05.200 --> 11:06.880]  And I ducked her cover, I thought.
[11:06.880 --> 11:08.800]  Yeah, interesting.
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.600]  Did you put them there?
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.280]  No, I believe that my wife is the perpetrator.
[11:16.480 --> 11:19.120]  And I believe that's why she came in with a very sheepish grin.
[11:20.000 --> 11:20.880]  That's cool.
[11:20.880 --> 11:21.840]  How many are there?
[11:22.640 --> 11:23.360]  Three.
[11:23.360 --> 11:24.080]  Several, right?
[11:24.080 --> 11:24.480]  Right.
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.480]  Well, now I've got a lot.
[11:26.480 --> 11:32.560]  See, my system with the SodaStream is I have four in the house at all times.
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.520]  And then as soon as three are empty, I take the three to the local Williams-Sonoma
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.840]  and exchange them for another three.
[11:39.840 --> 11:43.360]  But that way, if I put it off for a couple of days,
[11:43.360 --> 11:46.720]  I've got the fourth one in the machine keeping me carbonated.
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.200]  So our long national mystery of where my missing three canisters were is over.
[11:53.200 --> 11:53.920]  All right, where were we?
[11:53.920 --> 11:54.720]  What were we talking about?
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.600]  Spaceships.
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.200]  See, my system is use one up and then not make SodaStream for six months.
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.320]  No, I would die of dehydration.
[12:04.320 --> 12:10.000]  Well, I just have to buy the six-pack of Whole Foods sparkling water.
[12:10.000 --> 12:10.240]  Right.
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.080]  Anyway, we were talking about space.
[12:12.080 --> 12:13.120]  Do I want to go to space?
[12:13.120 --> 12:14.160]  No, I don't think I do.
[12:14.160 --> 12:15.040]  I don't know.
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.120]  I feel like I grew up at the wrong time.
[12:19.120 --> 12:24.000]  I was born in 1973, so I've never been alive when there's been a man on the moon.
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.080]  And I loved the space shuttle stuff when I was a kid.
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.800]  But then it was like, cool, we have a reusable spaceship.
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.680]  It made it seem like there was a coolness to that.
[12:37.120 --> 12:40.400]  Even as a little kid, you could tell that there was something wrong about the idea
[12:40.400 --> 12:48.000]  that they build these massive skyscraper-sized rockets that look just amazing and are just
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.360]  filled with jet fuel.
[12:49.360 --> 12:52.880]  And then by the time these guys got into space, they were in these tiny little things that
[12:52.880 --> 12:53.920]  were just at the tip.
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.920]  And then they come back when they land, all that comes back into the ocean is this tiny
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.040]  little thing that looks like a refrigerator.
[13:06.400 --> 13:07.760]  And you could tell that that's inefficient.
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.800]  So when the space shuttle program started, I don't know.
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.320]  I was in school the day the first space shuttle launched, and it was so awesome.
[13:17.280 --> 13:21.760]  Everybody got out of class, and we'd crowd around the TV and watch it on the news.
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.560]  And I think they even let us do it again when it landed.
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.800]  I think when the space shuttle landed, they pulled us all out of class and let us watch.
[13:28.800 --> 13:30.400]  And it was amazing, because here's the ship.
[13:30.400 --> 13:33.920]  It went, you know, there still were rocket, you know, to get it into space, there were
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.480]  disposable rockets, but the main ship itself came back.
[13:36.480 --> 13:38.480]  That seemed like, hey, we're getting somewhere.
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.080]  And then nothing else really happened, right?
[13:42.080 --> 13:43.360]  I mean, it's like after the space shuttle.
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.720]  And then, you know, the space shuttle program had a couple of, you know, like with the Challenger
[13:46.720 --> 13:49.200]  disaster, it was all kind of a bummer.
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.640]  Yeah, I would say for me that the main problem is I'm just not really a desert guy.
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.640]  So going to Mars, it's like, I'm not really interested in going to a giant desert.
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.520]  If it were lush mountains and streams, maybe that would be interesting.
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.040]  Yeah, I could see it.
[14:09.040 --> 14:14.640]  It may be, you know, like the 2001 Space Odyssey idea, if they put a Hilton just in orbit around
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.120]  the Earth.
[14:15.120 --> 14:17.440]  Yeah, put a Hilton in orbit.
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.280]  Put a Hilton in orbit.
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.880]  I might be convinced to go to that, but I feel like, yeah, going to Mars, it's, you
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.160]  know, it seems like certainly within our lifetime, there's never going to be a way to go there.
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.920]  That's not, you know, you know, incredibly long trip.
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.000]  I feel like it's a long enough trip flying to California.
[14:40.000 --> 14:40.320]  Right.
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.760]  Yeah, I was going to say enough.
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.560]  It's enough fun to go to LA for a few days.
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.840]  I had the Hilton in low orbit, though.
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.000]  I would withhold the right to go up there.
[14:54.000 --> 14:54.800]  That could be neat.
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.320]  That's basically like one of those Emirates flights where you have the suite with the
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.560]  bath, the shower now just going for a week instead of 12 hours or whatever.
[15:07.280 --> 15:07.840]  Yeah.
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.560]  And, you know, it would be cool to experience weightlessness, I guess.
[15:12.320 --> 15:14.160]  I'm not sure I get the infatuation with it.
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.320]  And I think, you know, I think you're right.
[15:16.320 --> 15:18.320]  I think it is sort of generational, though.
[15:18.320 --> 15:19.520]  And maybe these guys are right.
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.200]  You know, like, you know, maybe there was something to the the 60s.
[15:23.760 --> 15:26.720]  John F. Kennedy, you know, challenged to do something like that.
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.720]  Seems more than coincidental that Bezos and Moscow both both have that obsession.
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.440]  Well, maybe next year we need to have them both on at the same time dueling, dueling rockets.
[15:41.440 --> 15:43.680]  Yeah, it makes me wonder, like, like, did Bezos hang out?
[15:43.680 --> 15:44.800]  Was he there the next day?
[15:44.800 --> 15:46.720]  Did I like did they spend any time together?
[15:46.720 --> 15:49.440]  I know it was, you know, Bezos the first night and Musk the second.
[15:49.440 --> 15:51.360]  And I know Musk was late getting there.
[15:51.360 --> 15:54.080]  So he obviously wasn't there, you know, beforehand.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.760]  No, to my knowledge, there was no hanging out.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.160]  Just kind of a bummer.
[16:00.160 --> 16:06.720]  It'd be cool if the kind of VV VIP guests hung out and stayed around for a while.
[16:06.720 --> 16:15.600]  But a lot of times now they just kind of take take off, go back to wherever they come from.
[16:15.600 --> 16:18.160]  Go back to their bond layers, Bond villain layers.
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.320]  Yeah, I heard I heard last year that that the Snapchat guy basically showed up,
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.560]  took a brand new T-shirt out of a box, put it on, went on stage, got off stage and then left,
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.480]  basically. But it's the new T-shirt thing that gets me.
[16:38.480 --> 16:40.240]  Yeah, I'm not going on stage with that.
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.040]  No, it was like a brand new mid condition, deep V-neck T-shirt.
[16:45.040 --> 16:47.120]  Go on. I forgot the brand that we actually.
[16:48.080 --> 16:49.920]  So we just relaunched the site.
[16:49.920 --> 16:51.520]  I should probably explain why I'm there.
[16:51.520 --> 16:59.360]  But basically, you know, the Vox Media bought Recode over just over a year ago.
[16:59.360 --> 17:05.360]  And, you know, in many parts, in many reasons for the code conference itself,
[17:05.360 --> 17:11.440]  but also because the Recode website is so influential and, you know,
[17:11.440 --> 17:15.120]  just a brand that people know and I think trust.
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.360]  And, you know, they want to do a lot more with it.
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.320]  So they approached me earlier this year with kind of that that in mind.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.920]  And it sounded like a really exciting opportunity for me.
[17:27.920 --> 17:31.200]  So the first thing we did was completely redesigned the site
[17:31.200 --> 17:34.640]  and relaunch it on the Vox Media publishing system.
[17:34.640 --> 17:40.800]  And now we're about to open a bunch of jobs and hire new people
[17:40.800 --> 17:44.000]  and expand our coverage and do a lot of that sort of stuff.
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.080]  Dan, you left off the very most important thing that you guys did.
[17:49.120 --> 17:51.760]  Oh, yeah. We got rid of the slash.
[17:51.760 --> 17:54.720]  We got rid of the slash, which I never gave you anyway.
[17:54.720 --> 17:56.080]  No, that was like my first day.
[17:56.080 --> 17:58.000]  I think they were like, what are we gonna do with the slash?
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.080]  I'm like, we are getting rid of the slash.
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.880]  If there's ever a question about how to write the name of your site,
[18:04.880 --> 18:05.840]  that is a problem.
[18:05.840 --> 18:08.960]  So it was great.
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.520]  That's why I think they should have instantly,
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.920]  even if it was the first day, they should have given you a raise.
[18:13.920 --> 18:14.420]  Yeah.
[18:15.280 --> 18:18.640]  I mean, I think I remember maybe it was even you when they launched.
[18:18.640 --> 18:20.400]  You were like, I don't know about this slash.
[18:20.400 --> 18:20.960]  I was.
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.320]  I was immediately questioning the slash.
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.080]  Yeah, I didn't know what the history of it was.
[18:28.080 --> 18:33.200]  And I asked about it last week and I found out about it.
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.520]  And let's just say it's not an interesting story, so I won't repeat it.
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.040]  But I don't think anyone was really tied to it.
[18:41.680 --> 18:43.280]  Well, I'm all about simplicity.
[18:43.280 --> 18:46.160]  I mean, if you remember every time I build a website,
[18:46.160 --> 18:48.640]  it's the simplest layout possible.
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.560]  And not too much depth or complications.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.680]  So in my case,
[18:55.680 --> 18:58.080]  Recode has had that as part of their brand right from the start,
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.920]  that even when they had the slash in their name,
[18:59.920 --> 19:02.320]  it has been a very reader friendly site.
[19:03.600 --> 19:04.560]  I disagree.
[19:04.560 --> 19:06.000]  I think it got better.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.160]  I think that the redesign is better.
[19:08.160 --> 19:08.640]  It's better.
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.360]  I mean, before the front page was this very Pinterest looking thing
[19:13.360 --> 19:15.920]  with variable height blocks.
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.360]  And you could say, well, the front page doesn't really matter.
[19:19.360 --> 19:20.400]  People don't really go there.
[19:21.040 --> 19:23.280]  Our front page is actually still very popular.
[19:23.280 --> 19:26.160]  It's often the most popular page on the site.
[19:26.160 --> 19:27.600]  And it's much simpler now.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.480]  It's a standard reverse cron.
[19:30.480 --> 19:31.840]  Actually, not always reverse cron
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.000]  because we have complete control over the order of the post.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.200]  But it's much simpler.
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.920]  So I think my impression is it's mostly reverse cron,
[19:41.920 --> 19:45.680]  but you guys can pin like a blockbuster story to the top.
[19:45.680 --> 19:49.120]  Yeah, we actually do some pinning throughout the river.
[19:49.760 --> 19:51.120]  Like if there's a feature story,
[19:51.120 --> 19:53.680]  we'll keep that in the river up top for a few days,
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.360]  something like that.
[19:55.360 --> 19:58.560]  But before like the headline font was Futura,
[19:58.560 --> 20:02.560]  which is a great for like one word here and there,
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.320]  but not really the kind of font you'd want to ever read a sentence in, for example.
[20:07.600 --> 20:09.840]  So some of that stuff, I mean, it wasn't bad.
[20:09.840 --> 20:14.000]  It's just to me, it was an opportunity to really simplify
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.040]  and got to work with the really talented design.
[20:17.040 --> 20:22.080]  Actually, the guy who made our logo designed the Oculus logo for Facebook.
[20:22.080 --> 20:26.240]  He has designed, he designed the logo for Curbed
[20:26.240 --> 20:28.240]  and some of the other Vox media properties.
[20:28.240 --> 20:29.920]  So I'm really happy with it.
[20:29.920 --> 20:30.240]  Yeah.
[20:30.240 --> 20:33.040]  And the logo has a little homage to the slash.
[20:33.040 --> 20:34.560]  Yes, the implied slash.
[20:34.560 --> 20:34.800]  Yeah.
[20:34.800 --> 20:38.160]  And that actually was a little more pronounced in the earlier versions of it.
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.080]  And I kind of had them tweak it a little bit, but it works.
[20:42.080 --> 20:45.680]  I mean, the whole point is for the design to get out of the way
[20:45.680 --> 20:49.840]  and just break news and do good analysis and we'll do more.
[20:51.360 --> 20:57.120]  We did a few really big, ambitious profile features for our relaunch,
[20:57.120 --> 21:03.760]  which was about a month ago, including a really well-reported feature.
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.600]  One of the first really about Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat.
[21:07.600 --> 21:12.560]  And we sent one of our reporters to Kansas city to write about Google fiber,
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.120]  which had had now celebrated, I believe it's fifth birthday there.
[21:17.680 --> 21:22.560]  And both of those stories did so well that we were almost surprised.
[21:22.560 --> 21:25.120]  And now we have to figure out how to do more of those
[21:25.120 --> 21:28.240]  because they were really outside of our kind of workflow.
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.920]  So we're really happy with that.
[21:31.920 --> 21:34.640]  And it's been fun so far.
[21:34.640 --> 21:40.960]  You know, I guess kind of the back story is that for me,
[21:40.960 --> 21:44.240]  it's a reunion with my first boss, Peter Kafka,
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.560]  who I worked with at Forbes almost 11 years ago.
[21:48.560 --> 21:55.040]  And we left together in 2007 to start Silicon Alley Insider with Henry Blodgett.
[21:55.040 --> 22:00.000]  So we were the first three people at the site that became Business Insider.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.600]  And then Peter left to join Kara and Walt at All Things D.
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.840]  And I stayed on and now, basically a decade later we're reunited.
[22:09.840 --> 22:12.000]  And that's when you and I first got to know each other
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.800]  was when you were the Business Insider or Silicon Alley Insider at the time.
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.680]  Alley Insider, I still remember the first time you linked to us
[22:19.680 --> 22:23.120]  and probably said something probably like,
[22:23.120 --> 22:26.160]  well, this is wrong, but here's, I don't remember,
[22:26.160 --> 22:28.960]  but claim chowder or something.
[22:28.960 --> 22:29.600]  Yeah, I don't know.
[22:31.760 --> 22:32.720]  And what's your title?
[22:32.720 --> 22:33.920]  You're like the editor, right?
[22:33.920 --> 22:34.960]  I'm the editor in chief.
[22:34.960 --> 22:35.600]  Editor in chief.
[22:37.120 --> 22:38.640]  So now you're Peter Kafka's boss.
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.160]  Sort of.
[22:42.080 --> 22:46.240]  No one's really Peter's boss, but no, I mean, he's, you know, we work together.
[22:47.280 --> 22:51.440]  There's, and Kara Swisher obviously is very involved in the site,
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.040]  but basically it's kind of my site to do what I want with.
[22:55.040 --> 23:01.440]  And my perspective is that, you know, having now worked at some really interesting
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.120]  business publications and watch the tech section basically take over.
[23:06.480 --> 23:09.200]  You know, I think all you need is the tech section.
[23:09.200 --> 23:13.360]  So, you know, I don't know, I wrote somewhere that like tech,
[23:13.360 --> 23:16.560]  we used to cover tech as a thing, but now tech is everything.
[23:16.560 --> 23:19.840]  So, we'll keep adding new coverage areas.
[23:19.840 --> 23:26.320]  We recently hired a really wonderful transportation reporter to cover the rise of,
[23:26.320 --> 23:31.840]  well, it's not the rise anymore, but the continued growth of Uber, Tesla,
[23:31.840 --> 23:33.440]  and those types of companies.
[23:33.440 --> 23:37.360]  And, you know, I anticipate that, and by the way, that's a role that, you know,
[23:37.360 --> 23:41.360]  even three years ago we would have kind of scratched our heads out.
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.880]  Like, well, why would a tech site need a transportation reporter?
[23:44.880 --> 23:47.120]  But obviously, of course, of course you do.
[23:47.120 --> 23:48.000]  It is funny though.
[23:48.800 --> 23:55.280]  That's a perfect example of like how this industry changes on a, you know,
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.000]  five years is a good distance to go back.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.240]  Five years ago, that would have been like a head scratcher.
[24:00.240 --> 24:02.720]  And today it's like, you're nuts if you don't.
[24:02.720 --> 24:03.120]  Totally.
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.800]  I mean, five years ago, I think Uber already existed,
[24:06.800 --> 24:10.640]  but it would have been covered as a, you know, an app startup or something like that.
[24:10.640 --> 24:13.600]  And now everything is an app startup really.
[24:13.600 --> 24:19.920]  And just every industry is going to be, you know,
[24:19.920 --> 24:23.360]  reimagined by tech, some faster than others.
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.920]  And transportation is one that we've kind of identified early as something
[24:27.920 --> 24:31.760]  that we should really have a say in covering.
[24:31.760 --> 24:39.360]  I imagine, you know, at some point we'll be covering the tech of food or finance
[24:39.360 --> 24:40.800]  or all kinds of stuff.
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.920]  Basically, wherever we have personal interest or wherever we find a really great
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.480]  journalist who can do kind of own that coverage for us.
[24:50.480 --> 24:56.960]  Have you seen the story that was sort of a mini controversy about Tesla yesterday
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.000]  about like some guys, Tesla had the ball joint and the suspension sort of rusted out.
[25:04.480 --> 25:05.760]  Did you see this story?
[25:05.760 --> 25:06.320]  I did not.
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.720]  I'll put it in the show notes,
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.440]  but there was a guy who I'd never heard of before named Niedermeier,
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.360]  which always makes me think of Animal House.
[25:20.640 --> 25:27.520]  But I've never heard him, but he's a long time car industry,
[25:27.520 --> 25:30.400]  automobile industry writer, Edward Niedermeier.
[25:31.280 --> 25:32.480]  I know another Niedermeier.
[25:32.480 --> 25:36.560]  No, I'll send you a link, but I'm pasting this into the show notes right now.
[25:36.560 --> 25:37.440]  So I won't forget.
[25:37.440 --> 25:37.840]  Here we go.
[25:37.840 --> 25:38.560]  Boom, there it is.
[25:38.560 --> 25:48.160]  And the gist of his article and his writing on Tesla and Tesla responded.
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.120]  And it seems it's again, it's sort of like, you know,
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.720]  Musk has jobs like we're sometimes like with those like.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.520]  I mean, sometimes he'd sign them like with thoughts on music,
[25:59.520 --> 26:02.400]  but like remember the one time there was like a fact on the App Store.
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.920]  It was like an FAQ and it was like there was some stuff in there like,
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.120]  you know, the App Store doesn't need any more fart apps.
[26:09.120 --> 26:10.640]  You know, not everything needs to be made.
[26:10.640 --> 26:15.440]  And you could just tell that Steve Jobs, not just like stood over it,
[26:15.440 --> 26:18.720]  but that he like had his hands on the keyboard for some of that.
[26:18.720 --> 26:25.520]  And the Tesla PR response to this was sort of dismissive in a way,
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.560]  tonally in a way that like, you know, and there's enough people with Teslas out there.
[26:30.560 --> 26:32.880]  They're obviously not all falling apart, but you know,
[26:32.880 --> 26:34.880]  the gist of it was that they really blame this guy
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.400]  because he lived at like a two mile driveway to a remote home
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.280]  that was like a dirt road and that the car was just covered with dirt.
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.080]  And it's sort of an unexpected use of it.
[26:44.080 --> 26:46.640]  But it's you're holding it wrong.
[26:46.640 --> 26:46.880]  Right.
[26:46.880 --> 26:49.840]  But the gist of this Niedermeier guys is what made it more interesting
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.840]  than the specific incident of this ball joint in one Tesla at Model S.
[26:53.840 --> 26:57.200]  And whether they're in general, there's a problem is this guy
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.720]  who's a long time automobile industry watcher is very pessimistic on Tesla,
[27:02.720 --> 27:05.600]  more so than anybody I've seen in his argument is that.
[27:08.640 --> 27:11.200]  Again, I'll put it in the show notes, it's an interesting argument,
[27:11.200 --> 27:12.880]  and I'll probably link it from Daring Fireball.
[27:12.880 --> 27:14.800]  Actually, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
[27:14.800 --> 27:22.160]  But his argument is that it's there's a counterintuitive aspect to pricing cars
[27:22.160 --> 27:24.960]  and that people think, hey, when you spend a lot of money on a car,
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.040]  like let's say like a Model S, you expect a better quality car.
[27:31.040 --> 27:33.920]  And that's actually not true because you go super expensive
[27:33.920 --> 27:37.040]  and get like a Lamborghini or Ferrari and things fall apart all the time.
[27:37.040 --> 27:38.000]  And they're always in the shop.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.400]  And it doesn't matter because if you've got enough money for a Ferrari,
[27:40.400 --> 27:43.920]  you could just have your chauffeur drive you around in your Mercedes
[27:43.920 --> 27:45.440]  until the car's back out of the shop.
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.480]  And that it's the lower you go in prices, the lower the price car,
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.880]  the more the person who's buying it absolutely positively relies on it.
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.000]  And therefore it needs reliability.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.800]  And that's the secret to Toyota and Honda's success starting in the 70s
[28:02.800 --> 28:09.200]  is that they, from the top down, were focused on quality
[28:09.200 --> 28:12.720]  in a way that a company from Silicon Valley isn't going to get it right
[28:12.720 --> 28:15.280]  because quality at every step of the process
[28:15.280 --> 28:18.640]  is sort of the antithesis of the Silicon Valley model,
[28:18.640 --> 28:20.960]  which is move fast and we'll fix problems later.
[28:23.040 --> 28:26.480]  Like the revolution that Toyota brought to the assembly line
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.760]  was that the old way was that the car would keep moving down the assembly line.
[28:29.760 --> 28:31.680]  And even if a fault was identified,
[28:31.680 --> 28:34.480]  they'd try to fix the fault after it got off the end of the assembly line.
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.600]  And what Toyota is, the Toyota way, and that's actually a thing,
[28:37.600 --> 28:40.320]  like the W is capitalized, the Toyota way,
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.520]  is that as soon as a fault is identified in a car in the assembly line,
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.840]  the entire assembly line shuts down and they almost move it in reverse
[28:47.840 --> 28:51.760]  to identify where the fault happened and fix it right there
[28:51.760 --> 28:57.040]  to make sure that it isn't perpetrated in more than one car,
[28:58.480 --> 29:01.680]  even if it's expensive to shut down the assembly line and do it that way.
[29:01.680 --> 29:04.080]  But then that sort of expense of that
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.240]  is sort of what motivates everybody along the way to be hyper focused.
[29:08.240 --> 29:10.160]  You don't want to be the guy who shut down,
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.520]  caused the assembly line to shut down.
[29:12.240 --> 29:14.160]  And that Tesla doesn't have that mindset.
[29:14.160 --> 29:16.560]  And as they move down to more affordable cars,
[29:17.920 --> 29:20.560]  what's this, the new one called the Model 3?
[29:20.560 --> 29:22.080]  What's it called? I don't think so.
[29:23.680 --> 29:26.000]  Whatever the one is called that everybody went nuts for
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.960]  and bought gazillion preorders for at this $35,000 price range.
[29:30.960 --> 29:33.200]  People's expectations for reliability
[29:34.240 --> 29:37.600]  are going to be way higher than they were for the $100,000 Model S.
[29:37.600 --> 29:39.600]  And he doesn't think that they're suited to do it.
[29:40.240 --> 29:41.360]  Interesting theory.
[29:42.160 --> 29:43.520]  Yeah, I don't know about that.
[29:43.520 --> 29:46.880]  I mean, he seems really, again, I don't know.
[29:46.880 --> 29:49.680]  I've never, I don't own a Tesla.
[29:49.680 --> 29:53.520]  I don't know what their kind of global reliability is,
[29:53.520 --> 29:57.440]  but he did seem to really care about quality
[29:57.440 --> 29:59.680]  when he was talking about it at code where he was saying,
[29:59.680 --> 30:04.640]  even the people who bought the base level $35,000 version
[30:04.640 --> 30:07.280]  would get a pretty freaking awesome car.
[30:09.200 --> 30:11.520]  Definitely not like the kind of situation
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.600]  where you need to upgrade to the $50,000 tier or whatever,
[30:15.600 --> 30:18.640]  making that number up to get a great car.
[30:18.640 --> 30:23.680]  So, uh, it seems like safety is probably the biggest priority,
[30:23.680 --> 30:26.320]  but also, and you know, and also cool features,
[30:26.320 --> 30:28.080]  but I don't know.
[30:28.080 --> 30:31.600]  It seems like I don't, I don't have the perception
[30:31.600 --> 30:34.400]  that Tesla doesn't care about quality.
[30:34.400 --> 30:34.800]  I don't know.
[30:34.800 --> 30:36.560]  I, you know, it might also be the kind of thing
[30:36.560 --> 30:41.600]  where they're not old enough to have a long-term example
[30:41.600 --> 30:44.960]  of, of how their cars hold up over time.
[30:45.680 --> 30:45.920]  Yeah.
[30:45.920 --> 30:46.320]  I don't know.
[30:46.320 --> 30:52.080]  Uh, that seems like, you know, how you were describing this,
[30:52.640 --> 30:53.520]  we'll fix it later.
[30:54.080 --> 30:57.280]  That seems like the attitude for a lot of software companies,
[30:57.920 --> 31:00.480]  especially because the internet has made it so easy
[31:00.480 --> 31:02.880]  to patch software as it goes.
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.960]  And, you know, you could also argue that
[31:04.960 --> 31:07.280]  that's one of Apple's problems that they don't do that enough.
[31:08.160 --> 31:10.720]  But when it comes to hardware, it seems like the companies
[31:10.720 --> 31:17.120]  that excel at hardware make stuff to last more than the software company.
[31:17.120 --> 31:17.840]  So I don't, I don't know.
[31:19.200 --> 31:24.080]  Uh, and the other part of the controversy is that apparently it's come out that, um,
[31:24.080 --> 31:28.640]  when you're with, with certain out of warranty of repairs,
[31:28.640 --> 31:31.920]  that if your Tesla is out of warranty, let's say it's like three years old
[31:31.920 --> 31:34.000]  and you take it in, but it's a weird problem.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.920]  And they run it up, uh, the chain like, Hey, should we fix it for this guy
[31:37.920 --> 31:41.360]  or at a discount or for free that sometimes when they do that,
[31:41.360 --> 31:44.320]  they ask the person or, or in exchange for it, they,
[31:44.320 --> 31:46.880]  they have you sign what they call a goodwill agreement,
[31:46.880 --> 31:49.760]  which is effectively an NDA that you're not going to talk about that.
[31:49.760 --> 31:53.920]  You're well, you know, instead of what's charging you $3,000 for this repair,
[31:53.920 --> 31:56.160]  we'll only charge you $1,000, but you,
[31:56.160 --> 31:58.800]  but you need to sign this that says you're not going to talk about the problem.
[31:58.800 --> 32:03.040]  And people, some people are spooked about the, you know, the, the,
[32:03.040 --> 32:07.920]  uh, in a way that some people just get spooked when anybody's asked to sign an NDA.
[32:08.480 --> 32:12.720]  Yeah. Or how about the guy who, what did he trash them on Twitter? So he can't,
[32:12.720 --> 32:16.160]  uh, just literally can't buy a test.
[32:16.160 --> 32:21.840]  Stewart Alsop, long time technology columnist and, and, uh, now a, a, uh, VC
[32:23.280 --> 32:26.240]  Elon Musk personally canceled his order.
[32:27.760 --> 32:28.260]  Amazing.
[32:28.960 --> 32:31.440]  Which is a very Steve jobsy type thing.
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.200]  I mean, they're, they're very savvy about some of this stuff.
[32:35.200 --> 32:40.240]  They, you know, I wrote a post a couple of years ago about how they are effectively, uh,
[32:40.240 --> 32:45.120]  their own media company too, the way he would, the way that he handled criticism by the New
[32:45.120 --> 32:50.400]  York times and, you know, in other situations where Tesla essentially published, you know,
[32:50.400 --> 32:56.640]  their own media, um, without going to a, another reporter or something like that.
[32:56.640 --> 33:01.600]  They're, they're certainly ahead of the, uh, head of the curve in a lot of those things.
[33:01.600 --> 33:04.640]  I've got these, I've put a couple of links in the show notes already,
[33:04.640 --> 33:07.920]  so they'll be there for everybody who wants to read them here. I'll paste it for you.
[33:07.920 --> 33:12.480]  You don't have to read it while we talk. Um, let me take a break. Actually. It's a good
[33:12.480 --> 33:18.560]  time to take a break and thank our first sponsor and it's a new sponsor. Could not be happier
[33:18.560 --> 33:27.520]  to have them here. It's Eero, E E R O. Um, here's what they make. They make a brand new system
[33:27.520 --> 33:33.040]  of wifi routers. Uh, why would you want to do that? Well, here's why wifi is broken.
[33:33.040 --> 33:37.760]  Because, uh, for most people in most houses, unless you live in like a studio apartment,
[33:37.760 --> 33:42.800]  um, it's, if you have dead zones in your house, we're like, you know, you don't get good wifi.
[33:42.800 --> 33:50.080]  It's because it's just really hard for one wifi router to reach everywhere. Um,
[33:50.960 --> 33:54.000]  it's just, uh, it's really just the nature of physics that the, the,
[33:55.440 --> 34:00.160]  the waves just can't pass through walls as easily as they can pass through the air. And most people
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.360]  have walls and floors and multiple floors in their houses. So it really doesn't make sense.
[34:05.360 --> 34:10.240]  And then the old way of trying to extend it, uh, you know, oftentimes you'd end up with multiple
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.680]  networks within your house. It's like, you have to be like a system administrator to, to do it.
[34:15.680 --> 34:19.680]  So the single router model just doesn't work. What you need is a distributed system.
[34:19.680 --> 34:26.640]  And that's what Eero is. And it is amazingly simple. So they sent me as part of the sponsorship,
[34:26.640 --> 34:30.320]  they sent me a package. I got it. I set it up. They sent me a three pack. They give you three
[34:30.320 --> 34:34.880]  of these little things. Each one is identical. They're just little pucks, little Apple TV
[34:34.880 --> 34:41.280]  ask sized pucks, a little bit thinner, a little bit bigger, but a little square round rec puck.
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.960]  Honestly, it really does look like something Apple would design. It's that sort of
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.240]  visual aesthetic. It's not something you'd want to hide, you know, somewhere in a cabinet or
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.360]  something like that. It's easily something you wouldn't mind having out, you know, on behind
[34:55.360 --> 35:02.640]  your TV or whatever it is. Um, uh, it's got all the security stuff you'd want state of the art WPA
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.640]  to encryption, uh, great customer support. You can call them up on the phone and get a hold of
[35:08.640 --> 35:16.400]  a night wifi expert within 30 seconds. Um, and it's just so simple. They recommend one Eero for
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.280]  every thousand square feet of your home. Most houses, two or three euros. It's fine. So the
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.560]  three pack is a good starting point for just about anybody. And if you want to buy more,
[35:24.560 --> 35:31.520]  you can just buy more. Um, and it, you just plug it in to your router, replace,
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.760]  take your old router, throw it away, plug this into your cable with the ethernet, right? Just
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.640]  one of them gets the ethernet. Then wherever else you want to put them around your house,
[35:40.640 --> 35:48.160]  just put a couple more and they just configure themselves into a mesh network and just offer one
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.440]  effectively from you as somebody who just wants to hook up your Mac book to the wifi or your iPhone
[35:53.440 --> 35:58.560]  to the wifi. It just looks like one network. You put the password in, um, to configure it.
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.400]  You don't have to go to one of those goofy figures, you know, fakey fake websites with,
[36:02.400 --> 36:06.640]  with an IP address or whatever. They've got a nice app right there in the app store for iPhone and
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.600]  Android. Uh, you just go there on the app and configure it right there. Really nice app for
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.960]  configuration could not be easier. One of the pucks, it's not like a special one. Just pick
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.040]  one of them. One of them, plug it into ethernet, plug a couple more in around the house on
[36:21.040 --> 36:26.320]  different floors. And all of a sudden the fact that you can't get wifi in your bedroom or something
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.040]  like that, it's, it's all over. So I've got one. I can vouch for the ease. I can vouch for the fact
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.720]  that the dead spots that we've had in our house are no longer dead spots. Um, really, really great.
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.960]  So if you are looking, if you've got, if you're dissatisfied with your wifi at your house or
[36:41.680 --> 36:50.640]  looking for a new wifi router, go check out Eero, go to Eero E E R O.com and use the code,
[36:50.640 --> 36:58.320]  the talk show, and you will get free overnight shipping. So use that code. You'll get free
[36:58.320 --> 37:05.280]  overnight shipping. You'll have it tomorrow. My thanks to Eero. Uh, speaking of breaking news,
[37:05.280 --> 37:10.080]  what do you think about scoop, uh, scoop German leaving nine to five Mac and, uh,
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.000]  he's heading to Bloomberg. Yeah. Um, it's funny. I'd actually heard about that a few months prior,
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.520]  but I didn't say anything and I'm glad it, I'm kind of amazed it stayed, uh, stayed quiet.
[37:21.520 --> 37:27.920]  I heard about it too. I heard about it back at the March Apple event. Oh, cool. Um,
[37:28.800 --> 37:33.440]  and I even heard that it was Bloomberg and I thought about being snarky and posting something
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.160]  about it and I thought, nah, cause it seemed like it wasn't, it wasn't up and it wasn't clear to me
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.920]  whether Seth Weintraub at nine to five Mac knew it turns out. I think he did at least by March. Um,
[37:43.920 --> 37:48.240]  but I didn't want to be, I didn't want him to hear it that way. And I thought asked her,
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.080]  but I just thought it was funny that, that, uh, Mark Gurman who, who spoils all these things
[37:54.080 --> 37:58.480]  for Apple and other companies that, uh, a couple of people I know knew and nobody,
[37:58.480 --> 38:05.280]  nobody leaked it. Yeah. That's restraint. Uh, I think it's great. I think it's cool. I mean,
[38:05.280 --> 38:12.640]  it's going to be, uh, a bummer to compete with him. So, Hey Mark, if you, if you find yourself
[38:12.640 --> 38:18.240]  miserable at Bloomberg, give me a call. Uh, but I think it's cool. I, you know, he's going to get
[38:18.240 --> 38:25.280]  to work with Brad stone, who's a great journalist and have, uh, what I would imagine are very, uh,
[38:25.280 --> 38:33.680]  nice resources available to him and also a TV network and, and also, um, you know, an organization
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.560]  that has a very specific mission and a business model that has nothing to do with, uh, internet
[38:40.560 --> 38:50.320]  advertising and is being run by a, um, you know, a non, a non-web guy who many people thought would,
[38:50.320 --> 38:54.160]  would not really come back. And this is Mike Bloomberg, of course, not really come back and
[38:54.160 --> 39:01.120]  be the boss again, and then showed up and was the boss again. And, um, you know, is, is a very
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.520]  profitable business that is dominated by the terminal, which is going to face increasing
[39:07.520 --> 39:15.760]  competition. So it's, it's, and it's also kind of, uh, in the business of producing soulless,
[39:15.760 --> 39:23.120]  but extremely accurate, very fast, uh, you know, market moving news. So should be interesting.
[39:23.120 --> 39:28.480]  I mean, I would guess that a lot of the stuff that would be, uh, publishable at nine to five
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.160]  Mac will not be publishable at Bloomberg either because it's too small, you know, like feature
[39:34.160 --> 39:39.120]  store, you know, not, I don't mean long feature stories. I mean, stories about features of products
[39:39.120 --> 39:44.800]  that probably wouldn't, you know, wouldn't really cut it. Uh, we'll see how that goes. I don't know,
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.440]  but it also sounds like he's going to be working on non-Apple stuff too. So if he can use some
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.880]  of his reporting techniques, which, you know, I admire, um, to break news on, on other big
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.080]  companies, I thought I read that he was going to be working on stuff like Google and Amazon as well.
[40:00.080 --> 40:04.640]  Um, consumer tech, I think that's great. So it should be really interesting to see how it goes.
[40:04.640 --> 40:11.040]  Um, yeah, it's the scoop aspect. And that's why when I heard Bloomberg months ago,
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.680]  it immediately clicked as, Oh, that makes sense. Cause it Bloomberg. And again, this is, you know,
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.200]  you and I getting a little inside baseball here, but Bloomberg and, and, but it's interesting to
[40:19.200 --> 40:26.160]  you because Recode is definitely a, a scoop company too. Right? Like you guys definitely
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.520]  pride yourselves on breaking some stories, a lot of stories first. Absolutely. Yeah. And,
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.360]  and Bloomberg it's, it's institutional at Bloomberg too. Like, you know, it's sort of
[40:37.360 --> 40:44.800]  almost the opposite of me. I almost seldom ever break anything, uh, and don't really care about
[40:44.800 --> 40:51.760]  it, but it's, you know, uh, and it's, um, exemplified by the leaderboard at tech meme
[40:51.760 --> 40:59.760]  at which, you know, Garmin is so far out in the top of it's ridiculous. I think you're right
[40:59.760 --> 41:07.920]  though. It's going to be interesting to see how his, uh, the faster and looser style or standards
[41:07.920 --> 41:12.640]  of nine to five Mac compared, you know, how, how that translates to an institution with a more
[41:12.640 --> 41:19.600]  formal, um, set of standards. And, you know, I would say not having ever worked with Mark that,
[41:19.600 --> 41:26.720]  uh, his, his accuracy rate suggests that his personal standards are quite high. Yes. Uh,
[41:26.720 --> 41:32.880]  because it's very easy to get sucked into posting what you think is a scoop and then being wrong.
[41:33.760 --> 41:40.080]  Um, whereas, you know, even when he is somewhat wrong, it's usually, you know, could be easily
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.720]  explained by, well, he was right at the time, but you know, three months passed and totally
[41:44.720 --> 41:50.000]  reasonable for Apple to change the name of something or, you know, whether, whether they,
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.680]  I don't think they did it despite him that one time or whatever, but, um, but like, you know,
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.800]  to my recollection is never really been wrong about something in a way that suggests that his
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.840]  journalism is highly flawed. Uh, you know, I don't know who his sources are, but my guess is that
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.960]  he's has pretty high personal standards about that. So, uh, I've actually also never worked
[42:12.960 --> 42:19.120]  for Bloomberg, so I don't know what, how, how the, there's also the Bloomberg way, capital w.
[42:19.120 --> 42:26.560]  And, um, and I'm not sure how that will work with, with Mark, but it certainly is a,
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.640]  is an interesting place to be right now. So it should be fun or at least a learning experience.
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.320]  I mean, the dude is 23, so he can do it. He can kind of do a lot of different stuff and figure
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.840]  out what he likes. Yeah. It's and if, you know, if he doesn't like it, he can always move on.
[42:43.840 --> 42:52.960]  Interesting. Um, but to me, it's also interesting that he went that route as opposed to, um, you
[42:52.960 --> 43:00.400]  know, doing his own thing or taking on, um, you know, more independent stuff like nine to five or
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.400]  creating his own company or trying to work somewhere, you know, and I have no idea who
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.800]  else he talked to. Um, you know, he, he certainly could basically work at a lot of places. I mean,
[43:12.800 --> 43:19.040]  I would obviously have wanted to hire him at Recode if, if, uh, if I gotten to him before
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.520]  Bloomberg did, uh, but yeah, it's cool. I mean, you know, to be, to be open about what,
[43:25.520 --> 43:29.680]  what I was thinking, you know, this was when I was thinking about doing something new this year,
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.000]  one of the things that jumped back to mind was doing my own thing again and, you know,
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.240]  splat F 2.0 or something like that. Um, there's nowadays there are business models that didn't
[43:40.240 --> 43:45.840]  really exist when I started splat five years ago. So what about this new app store stuff?
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.760]  I think it's interesting. So you, uh, you got briefed, so why don't you start off and explain
[43:51.760 --> 43:59.120]  what, so I guess what happened? Yeah. So it's very fast moving. It was Monday. Uh, and someone
[43:59.120 --> 44:05.600]  at Apple PR, uh, asked me if, if I could be available Tuesday for a half hour or so phone
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.440]  call with Phil Schiller about some developer news that they're putting out ahead of WWDC next week.
[44:11.440 --> 44:17.440]  I said, I would try to find some time. Maybe I could, maybe I could squeeze that in. Uh,
[44:18.880 --> 44:22.800]  so Tuesday, you know, I had a, uh, I was gonna say a conference call, but it, you know,
[44:22.800 --> 44:26.000]  it was speakerphone and there were a couple of other people on the other end, but it, you know,
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.840]  it wasn't like other, it was just me on, on my end. It wasn't like the other report. I think
[44:31.840 --> 44:37.760]  some people, the people in California got to meet with them live, like the verge, um, that obviously
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.760]  wasn't going to work for me. Um, but yeah, and then Schiller told me that three things that are
[44:43.760 --> 44:49.120]  three of the things that they're doing, uh, or I have already done is, uh, the faster review times
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.240]  for the app store, uh, all the app stores. Um, we've noticed that because, you know,
[44:54.240 --> 44:58.960]  developers who are submitting apps and are used to week long approval times,
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.120]  getting their app approved same day, you know, it sticks out, but it's not a fluke.
[45:03.120 --> 45:10.800]  It's not some kind of short term, um, uh, happenstance. It's a deliberate plan that they took,
[45:10.800 --> 45:17.520]  um, three parts of the, what did they say? Staffing changes, which I think, I think there
[45:17.520 --> 45:23.680]  were a couple of managers in there who, uh, uh, were sort of roadblocks to, to moving this forward
[45:23.680 --> 45:29.680]  and that they're no longer there. Um, but in addition to that, I, it was very clear talking
[45:29.680 --> 45:33.760]  to Schiller that in addition to the staffing changes, I think that there's also just the,
[45:34.400 --> 45:38.720]  some, some changes to the way they're applying just the pure manpower of how many people are
[45:38.720 --> 45:45.840]  doing the reviews, um, tool changes. Uh, and I heard a little bit more about this off the record
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.240]  from other people later in the week, but definitely some, some really good engineers
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.960]  at Apple. Um, I mean, they're not talking about the details of what these tools are, but that
[45:54.960 --> 46:01.200]  there's, there's been a significant effort expended within Apple to create internal tools
[46:01.200 --> 46:08.400]  to expedite the software, the app review process. Um, they're not revealing details, not even
[46:08.400 --> 46:14.320]  off the record, but, um, it's not minor. This is the thing I've understood that months,
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.200]  months of time from really good engineers were applied to this. Uh, and then the last one,
[46:19.200 --> 46:25.360]  the mystery one to me is policy changes. And I asked Schiller if he could expend upon that,
[46:25.360 --> 46:29.040]  expound upon that. And he hesitated and said, I'd rather not talk about it.
[46:30.240 --> 46:34.400]  So I don't know what that means, but, uh, he did and then he stopped and he did give one example.
[46:34.400 --> 46:40.800]  And he said, well, here's one example, um, that if, uh, if an, a developer has three apps and
[46:40.800 --> 46:46.480]  they're sort of interrelated and, and they update some core component of it and all three apps get
[46:46.480 --> 46:53.440]  submitted at the same time. Now, when the reviewer pulls the app from the queue, I mean, he didn't
[46:53.440 --> 47:00.640]  use the word inbox, but effectively the inbox of, of apps waiting for approval, uh, they'll get all
[47:00.640 --> 47:05.520]  three at once and they can review them together. And if there's any kind of interconnectedness
[47:05.520 --> 47:10.880]  between the apps, it can really ex it can make it, you know, an hour long thing instead of a
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.360]  days long thing. Um, which is interesting, but to me, that's not really a policy change. That
[47:15.360 --> 47:21.920]  sounds like it's more part of the tool changes. I suspect that part of the policy, this is nobody
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.240]  told me this, this is just my thinking about what this could be. Uh, nobody told me this on the
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.480]  record or off the record, so I could be way off, but I can't help, but think that maybe some of
[47:32.480 --> 47:40.720]  the policy changes are a little bit of, um, almost just granting the, the reviewers a little bit of
[47:40.720 --> 47:49.920]  common sense, um, uh, latitude where like if a developer, if they pull up the app and they look
[47:49.920 --> 47:57.280]  at the developer's history and it's Marco Arment and here's all of the apps that he's had before.
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.840]  Here's the app. He's submitting a new version of Overcast. Here's the previous updates to Overcast.
[48:01.840 --> 48:08.080]  And he says that this is an update that fixes a sinking bug and that maybe that there's a sort of
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.800]  like, well, I think we can trust this guy, look at his history. He's got a reputation, put it
[48:12.800 --> 48:17.920]  through, you know, that, or, you know, run the, whatever tests you want to do, but that, uh, an
[48:17.920 --> 48:24.880]  app from a developer with a trusted record is going to get less of a, uh, thorough combing over
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.840]  than a brand new 1.0 app from a developer who doesn't really have a history or whose history
[48:29.840 --> 48:38.800]  isn't really, um, uh, uh, high profile. I can't help but think that it must be that there must
[48:38.800 --> 48:46.000]  be something like that. I don't know. Um, I mean, and this seems to make sense and if anything,
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.440]  it's, it's kind of absurdly late to make changes like this. I mean, if you, if you think of the
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.720]  app store as a nine year old product, pretty much every other product that was launched nine years
[48:56.720 --> 49:04.800]  ago has, has been vastly improved. Uh, and it seems like, you know, whether it was just a low
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.360]  priority for Apple, but the developer app store experience just really didn't change that much
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.400]  over the years. Yeah. The things that they added were so minor. I mean, it's things like bundles,
[49:14.400 --> 49:18.400]  you know, where you could sell to the same developer could sell a bundle of two or three
[49:18.400 --> 49:24.160]  apps as a single purchase. Uh, you know, it's, that's, I mean, it was nice, but I mean, it's
[49:24.160 --> 49:28.960]  like, wow, that's not really a major change. And it, it wasn't something that really addressed
[49:28.960 --> 49:33.280]  some of the fundamental problems that developers had with the app store, like these lengthy review
[49:33.280 --> 49:38.560]  times. Right. I think it's fair to say, I would guess that if there were any, and this is, you
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.320]  know, it's far fetched, but the idea that remember back in the day was, oh, there should be multiple
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.880]  app stores and Apple should have to compete with, with other app stores. You, you could bet that if
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.120]  there were other app stores that Apple would have made improvements like this a long time ago and
[49:53.120 --> 49:58.720]  much more quickly. So, um, you know, it, yes, it's nice to see stuff like this happen, but
[49:59.760 --> 50:05.840]  I, you know, so there was a, uh, not really a, not like a major reorg, but a minor reorg and
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.280]  some promotions back in December, um, within Apple. And one of the things that got shuffled
[50:11.280 --> 50:16.080]  around was that the app store got moved from being under at EQ to being under Phil Schiller,
[50:16.080 --> 50:22.080]  um, and that Phil Schiller was going to take a much more active role in overseeing it.
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.800]  And this is the result of it. That's why it was Schiller who was giving me and, and Jim
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.760]  Dalrymple and the verge Lauren good at the verge. And I think, um, I think the UK Telegraph, I
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.440]  forget who wrote it, but I think that they might've been the only four. We might've been the only four
[50:37.440 --> 50:43.200]  who got it a day in advance. Um, and if it was more than that, it wasn't many more. Um, but that's
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.600]  why it was Schiller doing the briefing. Cause it's, this is his baby. I mean, this is his,
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.440]  these are the results of his actions. I think it's completely non hyperbolic to say
[50:54.480 --> 50:59.040]  that the app store has improved more in the six months under Schiller than it did in eight years
[50:59.040 --> 51:04.720]  under at EQ. I don't think that's, I'd agree with that. And why is that? And a couple of,
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.880]  you know, there's been people emailing me, you know, Twitter, you know, what's, is this,
[51:08.880 --> 51:13.600]  is that EQ? Is he incompetent? What's, what's the problem? I don't think that's the case.
[51:13.600 --> 51:18.240]  I think it's, I don't think it's a case that Eddie Q couldn't get things like this done.
[51:18.960 --> 51:26.800]  I think it's just that he didn't choose to that, that his worldview and what he saw as important
[51:26.800 --> 51:32.960]  in the store wasn't as developer focused as it, as it is under Schiller. And I just think it didn't,
[51:32.960 --> 51:36.560]  it didn't rise to a priority level that it, that it got done. Like it might've,
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.560]  these things might've been on the list under Q, but that they didn't percolate to the top of the
[51:40.560 --> 51:45.280]  list and therefore didn't get done. Well, it's also very easy for Apple to feel like the app
[51:45.280 --> 51:51.440]  store is a huge grand slam hit. I mean, and a huge success that the number, the growth was,
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.080]  was unprecedented. The numbers are all up and to the right. And, and how, you know, how can you
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.240]  argue with the success of this, the store? And by the way, we've, we've written you checks for
[52:00.240 --> 52:04.960]  billions of dollars. So why aren't you happier? $40 billion, I think is the number. And I think,
[52:04.960 --> 52:07.920]  I think that's what Schiller told me the other day. And, and, and that might be,
[52:07.920 --> 52:13.440]  it might just be that that was the number from January and it doesn't even include whatever
[52:13.440 --> 52:18.160]  they've paid since from January to now, because of that, that hasn't been either hasn't been
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.800]  tallied or hasn't been authorized to come out. And to me, what's even more amazing and could be
[52:22.800 --> 52:29.120]  10 to, you know, a hundred times more amazing is that's only the money that goes through the iTunes
[52:30.080 --> 52:35.760]  system. It does not include the money that goes, for example, directly to Uber or something like
[52:35.760 --> 52:42.320]  that, which is in my, you know, I'm, I'm making this up, but it's, it could be five to a hundred
[52:42.320 --> 52:47.680]  times more money that, that actually goes through apps that has nothing to do with, with that $40
[52:47.680 --> 52:53.280]  billion. So yeah, for me, by far and away, the most money I spend is on Uber without question
[52:53.280 --> 52:58.400]  through my phone. The most money I spend has gotta be through Uber or the, or the Apple store app
[52:58.400 --> 53:04.320]  when I buy a new laptop or something like that, but, uh, or Amazon or whatever, but there's so
[53:04.320 --> 53:10.480]  much money that goes through these apps and you really do have to make it a better product for,
[53:10.480 --> 53:16.480]  for developers, for app users, for everyone. So, um, you know, so the, I guess the other
[53:16.480 --> 53:21.920]  changes are more, I guess they're all kind of developer focused. Well, the subscription
[53:21.920 --> 53:32.800]  pricing. So how did they, how did they kind of frame that? It was, it was framed as we've had
[53:32.800 --> 53:40.000]  subscriptions, but for a very limited number of type of apps, con mostly content producing apps,
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.160]  like video streaming, audio streaming, you know, like Spotify. Um, it's great. Schiller is such
[53:46.160 --> 53:52.240]  a pro that he's never knocked off. So it's like, he never mentions any competitors even just on
[53:52.240 --> 53:57.280]  like a phone call. Never even. So he never didn't mention span Spotify or Pandora, but he just
[53:57.280 --> 54:04.160]  mentioned, you know, uh, streaming audio streaming video. Um, remember the daily, I think was one of
[54:04.160 --> 54:09.680]  the first publications. And he said news news obviously qualifies, you know, you can subscribe
[54:09.680 --> 54:16.000]  to, to, uh, paywall publications like, uh, uh, New York times and wall street journal through an app.
[54:16.800 --> 54:26.400]  Um, uh, more or less an app that you have to subscribe to get content in, you know,
[54:26.400 --> 54:30.560]  on a regular basis. And he said, well, you know, we want to change that to open that up to all
[54:30.560 --> 54:38.400]  app categories. Um, and he, he mentioned, and I didn't quote him on this, but I know that the
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.680]  verge did too. The verge quoted him on it, uh, that it would apply to like a, a productivity
[54:43.680 --> 54:50.480]  app that requires, you know, constant updates to support features and, and stuff like that.
[54:50.480 --> 54:57.840]  And so I took it initially as meaning that just about any app would be able to use subscription
[54:57.840 --> 55:04.960]  pricing in any way they see fit. Um, so that if you wanted to, um, like an app like Vesper,
[55:04.960 --> 55:08.800]  the app that the, you know, me and Brent Simmons and Dave Whiskas made,
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.960]  if we wanted to do subscription pricing, we could just do subscription pricing. Um,
[55:12.960 --> 55:22.400]  uh, and then, you know, when they published their own website, it Apple's website,
[55:22.400 --> 55:27.360]  the language on the webpage made it seem as though it was still mostly about getting content.
[55:27.360 --> 55:32.160]  And it was very, very confusing. And then, you know, I emailed Apple PR and I got,
[55:32.160 --> 55:35.280]  I got answers, but they were opaque and
[55:35.280 --> 55:45.520]  the long story short, you know, and then I got a phone call. Um, and the answer is I posted
[55:45.520 --> 55:51.520]  something last night about this, that, you know, they're, they're still thinking about how to
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.720]  clarify this, but that they're absolutely aware of developer's uncertainty about this. Definitely
[55:57.760 --> 56:04.240]  looking forward to, to talking to developers next week at WWDC about the way that developers have
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.880]  in their head that they'd like to use subscription. And that in the week after WWDC, they anticipate
[56:10.880 --> 56:17.280]  posting, publishing something that clarifies some kind of fact that clarifies what the rules are
[56:17.280 --> 56:24.560]  going to be. And what is this? When does this take effect? Is it part of the iOS nine SDK
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.200]  and app store, or is this something that won't really work until iOS 10 anyway? I,
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.680]  I, that's a good question. I think it's iOS 10. I think they're launching. So they have time.
[56:33.680 --> 56:39.760]  Yeah. They said that they're launching a beta over summer. Um, and there are already subscription
[56:39.760 --> 56:45.920]  apps and they'll get to take advantage of that new pricing system immediately. It sounds like,
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.520]  yeah, well, and the new rev share, one of the big, yeah, that might be the biggest thing that
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.960]  they announced was that any app was any app using subscriptions after a subscription is a year old,
[56:56.400 --> 57:03.360]  this revenue split changes from 70 30, which is what Apple publicly used for everything at
[57:03.360 --> 57:09.840]  all times everywhere. Um, there are longstanding rumors that like on Apple TV, some of the
[57:09.840 --> 57:16.080]  their individual deals made out with companies that are better, probably 85 15, I guess. Um,
[57:18.160 --> 57:23.440]  but that at least for developers in the iOS and Mac app stores, everything is 70 30 in app purchases,
[57:23.440 --> 57:29.680]  app purchases, subscriptions, everything after a year, it goes to 85 15 until the end of the
[57:29.680 --> 57:35.760]  subscription. And that's terrific news because that's a significant difference, especially if
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.960]  it's a three, four, five, six years subscription, it's a lot, a lot of money. That's like a 20%
[57:40.960 --> 57:46.800]  increase. So that's interesting. And it applies to me. That applies immediately. So if you believe
[57:46.800 --> 57:52.560]  retroactively, right? Yes. So if you already have a subscription app, uh, you know, that,
[57:52.560 --> 57:58.160]  that previously qualified for a subscription with the old rules, all of your subscribers,
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.640]  who've been with you for more than a year, that's starting next week. I think, you know,
[58:02.640 --> 58:06.480]  when the next building cycle for those subscriptions comes around, it'll be 85 15 for
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.880]  you. That applies immediately. Which is nice. I mean, you, you could also argue that it really
[58:12.880 --> 58:19.840]  should just be 97%, 3%, because once the marketing is done, Apple's really only facilitating
[58:20.640 --> 58:27.280]  credit card transactions, but, um, you know, they also are in the position to, uh, set the rules.
[58:27.280 --> 58:32.000]  So, uh, I think it's interesting to me, one of the most interesting things about this
[58:32.000 --> 58:40.960]  subscription thing is that, uh, this is kind of the problem, the app store solved for prior,
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.920]  uh, mobile apps. If you, you know, if you think back to the days before the iPhone,
[58:46.640 --> 58:51.360]  when you had a flip phone or whatever, there, there were apps and there were games and that
[58:51.360 --> 58:54.960]  kind of stuff, and they were all sold on subscriptions and they were comically over
[58:54.960 --> 59:00.480]  price subscriptions and the phone companies took most of the money and the developers got
[59:00.480 --> 59:06.400]  hosed on a lot of it, which is one of the reasons that these, uh, these apps really
[59:06.400 --> 59:10.800]  never took off, but they all got added to your phone bill. Yeah. And I believe, I think there
[59:10.800 --> 59:15.360]  were even like class action lawsuits about, you know, how you would kind of get suckered into
[59:15.360 --> 59:21.200]  subscribing to one of them and never get, uh, never, it was never easy to get to unsubscribe
[59:21.200 --> 59:26.320]  and that's that kind of stuff. But when the app store came out in 2008 and made it, you know,
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.280]  an ownership model where for a few bucks or, and then, you know, what, what eventually went down to
[59:31.280 --> 59:36.560]  99 cents and free, you could actually buy an app and own it. That was a huge difference over
[59:36.560 --> 59:41.920]  the previous model where, you know, you might get Tetris for five 99 a month or something like that
[59:41.920 --> 59:49.600]  of which the developer got less than half of it. And so it is a different time. And obviously the,
[59:49.600 --> 59:54.640]  the devices themselves have changed so much since then and the apps themselves too. Uh,
[59:54.640 --> 01:00:02.320]  I think the better, the better model now to kind of look at is, is, is, is how profoundly different,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.680]  uh, Adobe's businesses now that they've been able to switch to recurring subscription revenue for
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.400]  their creative suite products and Microsoft too, for, for office. And, you know, and if,
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:20.880]  if Apple is trying to make the iPad pro a professional device and they want companies
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.400]  like Adobe and Microsoft to make their highest end software for it, they really need to support
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:34.000]  the business models that, uh, that those companies are using. So I think that I do expect them to
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:42.160]  clarify what sort of apps could do subscriptions. I mean, we've, you know, you also see on the indie
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.720]  side, you see an app like Marco's podcasting app where he charges an optional subscription just
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.280]  because you want to support him. So he doesn't renew though. I don't think. Yeah. And I don't
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.680]  know how that, how that sort of thing. I wonder if that, uh, I wonder if that would hold up under
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:06.480]  whatever policies they would Institute. I think that I I'm really optimistic about this. If Apple
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:13.040]  takes a laws, a fair attitude to it and let developers, I, to me, Apple's role should be
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:21.120]  there to serve as the trusted intermediary between you and the developer you're paying
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.320]  for the subscription to meaning that Apple will be there to make sure that you can unsubscribe
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.240]  easily at any time that you're not going to get the rate changed on you behind your back.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:39.120]  Any rate change you have to approve explicitly, um, that sort of thing. Um, and I think that's,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.000]  that's perfect. And then other than that, I think that they should just let developers try
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.520]  whatever pricing they want and see what works. I don't think that they should really get in
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.320]  a way. So like if a developer of, uh, something that doesn't get any content at all, like a
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:02.880]  calculator app, like P Calc from James Thompson wants to switch to a $3 a year subscription so
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:09.840]  that there's ongoing revenue, um, and that he can keep doing things like, uh, updating the app for
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.960]  new OSS and, and not have to, you know, cause there's no upgrade. This is the pro there's no
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.400]  upgrades in the app store. I know. I don't think there are going to be, um, and so apps like tweet
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.960]  bot and Twitter ethic have done things over the years where like when tweet bot comes out with
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.400]  a major new version of tweet bot, it's a new SKU in the app store. And if you own tweet bot three
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.720]  to get tweet bot four, you have to buy tweet bot four and it downloads as a new app next to tweet
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.920]  bot three on your, on your device. And you have to set it up again and make sure your accounts
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.320]  are in there. And then probably, you know, delete the old version of tweet bots. You're not getting
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.240]  like duplicate notifications for the DMS and stuff like that. Um, and that whole fiddly,
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.960]  like now I've got two apps on my home screen and I want to delete the old one and, uh, use the new
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:06.080]  one. It's even worse in some ways than old school managing your applications on a Mac or PC because
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.320]  of the sandbox. Although I guess maybe to app from the same developer, I think maybe when you
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.080]  with treat bot, because it's the same developer, they can look in the sandbox. Yeah, I guess that
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.840]  actually now that I think about it when I, I'm confused cause I'm a beta tester of tweet bot.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.160]  So I see all sorts of weird stuff, but I guess maybe they can read the old tweet bot three
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.240]  information cause they're the same developer. And so it's a little bit easier to migrate,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.400]  but the whole idea of having to manage these apps as two different apps and, and keep it straight
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.080]  and delete the one you don't want anymore. That's the, that's the sort of system administration
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.000]  nonsense that the app store is supposed to eliminate, but there's no other way for a
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.120]  developer to, to put months and months and months, if not years of development time into a major new
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.480]  version, when most of their customers are, you know, they already have most of the customers
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.720]  they're going to get that they want to make money. You know, they need to make, they need to monetize
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.640]  the users. They already have to support the ongoing development. And to me, subscription
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:07.040]  pricing is, is the way forward. Yeah, I agree. And I, I agree with your assessment that they
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.480]  should let the market sort it out. If, you know, if people want to use this model,
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.960]  then they'll pay for it. And if they don't, they just won't and the app will fail. So,
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.400]  Right. Or it'll change, you know, adapt or die, you know, change to paid upfront,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.840]  go back to paid upfront or something like that. And I know that there are people listening. I
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.760]  know I've heard from you on Twitter. I know that there are people who really hate subscription apps
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.000]  and that they like the idea, like just basic idea of, all right, I'll give you, we'll agree X amount
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.400]  of dollars. I'll give you $5 for this version of your app. And if a year from now you have a
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.240]  version with new features and you want more money from me, I get to evaluate whether those features
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.040]  are worth it to me. And if not, I'll just stick with the one that I have and it'll keep working.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.840]  Whereas if it's a subscription model and a year from now, you're not happy with what the app is
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.480]  and you want to stop your subscription before it renews the app, you know, depending on how
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.480]  the developer has a configured is probably going to stop working or go back to a very limited
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.080]  feature set. And you're going to lose what you had because you didn't renew the feature.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.680]  I realized that in some ways that's a step back from the user's perspective.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.160]  But the truth is that apps tend to stop working after a year or two anyway, if you're not upgrading
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.600]  to the latest version just because of OS changes, that subscription model just makes that more
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.720]  instantaneous. And that's the way stuff has worked on the web forever. I think the web has sort of
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.720]  changed people's mindset on stuff like this. Like if you sign up for a service like Basecamp,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.600]  if you stop paying for Basecamp, nobody expects.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.520]  Right, exactly. Yeah, nobody expects that you can keep using the old Basecamp.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.960]  Yep. Yeah, the models have changed. And, you know, don't be a cheap ass, I think is,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:01.680]  is part of it. But, you know, if you get value from software, and if the model for the developer
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.880]  to, you know, build a sustainable business is to make it a recurring revenue thing. I also wonder
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:13.040]  how much of this is, has to do with this new Apple like we're a services company thing. Probably,
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.480]  that's probably not the number one, number two, or even number three factors. But for Apple to
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.160]  get more recurring revenue through the App Store is a great thing as well. So yeah, well, this is
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.520]  why I think they should take a laissez faire attitude towards it. And the reason that I'm
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:33.680]  optimistic, I mean, here, to me, the biggest hole in the ecosystem, I think I don't see how anybody
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:40.320]  could deny this, the biggest hole in the ecosystem is serious productivity software for the iPad.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.440]  That there's lots of great iPhone apps that you can do, quote unquote, work with about as best
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.080]  as you can expect to on the phone, ambitious apps for the phone. And the Mac, that's the whole
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.040]  reason the Mac even still exists is that there are serious applications that people who work on their
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:06.000]  Macs all day long, can get their work done on. And those sort of apps, there are some for iPad,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.600]  but nowhere near as many as there are on the Mac. And a lot of them are a lot.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.560]  I would say nowhere near as many as as are necessary for the iPad to become,
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.600]  you know, the future work machine for a lot of people.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:26.240]  Yes, exactly. I mean, an example would be the very, very popular drawing and it's a sort of
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:36.480]  specialized in UI design tool, Sketch, Sketch app. It's very popular. And they just announced that
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.520]  they have a sort of, it's not a subscription, but they have a sort of annual, you know,
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.440]  I'll put it in the show notes, I'll make a note, but they're Mac only. And people love this app.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:53.280]  Sketch is a big, big part of the UI design workflow for an awful lot of developers.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.400]  And they don't have an iPad app. And they've actually come out publicly and said,
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.840]  we don't really have plans to make an iPad app because we don't think it'll be worth it
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.280]  financially. We don't think that the money we could make from it, given the ecosystem,
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:14.240]  you know, the pricing, you know, the prices people expect on iPad, it's just not going to be worth
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.440]  it. You know, I think it's, I think Sketch is like $100 on the Mac. And there's just no way,
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.680]  you know, it doesn't seem like they could, like the iPad supports that. Maybe if they could go
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.120]  to like, say a $5 a month subscription, they could, maybe that would work. I don't know. I
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.760]  don't want to say Sketch in particular, but that's just the sort of thing. You don't see people
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.680]  saying we're not going to make a Mac professional tool because we don't think we can make money at
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:44.640]  it. And you do see people saying that on iPad. And I can't help but hope, I wouldn't necessarily
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.880]  bet on it, but it seems to me possible that subscription pricing for apps like Sketch
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.160]  could be the answer for the iPad.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.360]  Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it would have been neat to launch it
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.360]  at the same time as saying, and by the way, Sketch is coming to iPad.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.200]  Easier said than done. The switch from buying stuff to subscribing
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.440]  to stuff is happening elsewhere, too. I mean, that's where music is going. And there's, you
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.920]  know, rumors that Apple is in particular in it, you know, obviously Apple Music is a big,
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.720]  a big effort in subscription pricing, but that they're strategically de-emphasizing
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.360]  purchasing music from iTunes as time goes on. I mean, there've been a couple of reports about that.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:32.080]  I subscribe to paper towels. An awful lot of people watch an
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.160]  awful lot of video through Netflix, you know, that they're not buying all this stuff. They're
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.520]  paying Netflix eight bucks a month or nine bucks a month or whatever tier they're at and watching
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.560]  it until their subscription isn't there anymore, at which point they watch nothing. You know,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.040]  you subscribe to paper towels. Your paper towels don't disappear, though, if you stop your
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.600]  subscription. True. And I realize there are definitely trade-offs, but I think people who
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.320]  want to be knee-jerk, I'm going to resist this. You know, I'm not going down this route at all.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.360]  You're not moving forward with the industry. And again, I acknowledge that there's,
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.280]  it's not perfect, but it's, you know, it's the way things are going.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.040]  There's also the ads. We can talk about the ads, but let me take a break before we do that. I'll
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.880]  come back to that. And I want to thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Harry's.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.320]  Harry's shaving set will make the perfect father's day gift, but you got to order this soon. You got
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.080]  to order like right now. Like you're probably listening to this. I think a lot of people
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.640]  are going to listen to this over the weekend of June 11th and 12th before WWDC.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.800]  Order now and you could get this stuff before the following Sunday, which is father's day.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.120]  So listen, don't even, you know, maybe even just, uh, maybe even just stop right now. Just pause the
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:58.720]  podcast and go to Harry's.com. Uh, and remember the code, uh, talk show, not with the, the just
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.800]  talk show and you'll save five bucks. Um, uh, just stop the show and go order something for your dad.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.160]  They have a father's day shave kit with a matte black razor handle. Looks great. Chrome razor
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.880]  stand. Uh, Harry's moisturizing foam, shave gel, three of their handcrafted blade cartridges,
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.720]  a travel cover, and it's all for just 40 bucks. And it comes in a sleek giftable box with the
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.080]  option to add custom engraving and a personalized card. Um, they have regular shaving kits. If
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.040]  you're not looking for a gift started just 15 bucks. Uh, and here's the deal. They, they have
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.840]  their own blade factory. They, they were sourcing them from this razor blade factory that in Germany
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.760]  and they were so happy with it. They just bought the factory. They just make the blades themselves.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.600]  They sell stuff to you guaranteed and they easily beat the price of big name companies like Gillette
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.880]  and Schick and those people because they're not going through middlemen stuff from Gillette.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.920]  Gillette makes razorblades and then it goes to a middleman and a distributor and then it goes to
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.160]  like your local drugstores distributor and then the drugstores send it to the individual retail
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.720]  place and the retail place has to pay all this stuff for the store that they're in and all the
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.200]  employees who were there. And then you got to go find a guy to come and unlock the thing to the
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.600]  anti shoplifting glass thing to buy these razor blades. You're paying twice the price for the
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.800]  blades and it's a big pain in the ass. Go to Harry's use that code talk show. You say five
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.120]  bucks off your first purchase and you can get a father's day gift. Uh, you got to act quick on
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.200]  that. Um, and if it's just for you, you can do things like, uh, get a, get a subscription.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.200]  There we go. Tying it in with the show where you can get, uh, figure out how often you need new
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.200]  blades and you don't even have to do anything. They'll just show up every, every month or three
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.360]  months or whatever you need. So go to Harry's.com and remember that code talk show. Great sponsor.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.960]  So the last thing Apple introduces, uh, search ads in, in, uh, the app store.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.120]  And now that I see what they're doing here, I don't think that it's, I think it's worth talking
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.960]  about, but I don't think it's worth, I think anybody who's upset about it is it's a little
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.160]  misplaced. I don't know that Apple needed to do this, but I feel like it's, this isn't really
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:13.760]  detrimental and it might end up helping developers. It's including a smaller ones. Um, I think the
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.280]  fear that people have is that this is going to be a thing where, uh, the auctions for these keywords
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.160]  or whatever are all going to be won by bigger developers with big ad budgets. And it's just
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.400]  going to further promote, um, the rich getting richer, meaning the most popular apps getting
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.880]  more popular. But talking to Schiller and seeing how they're doing it, I think not. I think this
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.280]  might actually be a good way for small developers, you know, including really small individual ones
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:50.400]  to with a minimal ad spend that they're completely in control of, um, to get their app at the top of
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:57.680]  the listing for more searches. And interesting statistic that, uh, that Schiller revealed was
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.640]  that 65% of all app downloads still come or the path to it is from the search box in the app store
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.960]  app. Um, so getting your app, being able to pay to get your app at the top of that list is actually
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.280]  seems pretty, pretty worthwhile. Yeah. I mean, these, these ads work for a reason and they've
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:25.440]  driven a lot of growth for Facebook's mobile business and, uh, Google has them. Uh, it seems
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:31.840]  logical that Apple would have them too. I'm sure they'll make a nice amount of money for it. Uh,
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:39.920]  and it may, I don't think it makes up for the fact that the app store needs to be better organic
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:46.320]  search and just the app store browsing and discovery experience needs to be better, but
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:54.160]  it, you know, it's hard to fault them for, for building a system like this. Uh, and even then
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.720]  I've talked to developers who, who buy a lot of downloads on, on Facebook and Google and
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:08.000]  it's still way cheaper than acquiring a customer almost any other way. Yes. Yeah. I've heard that
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.360]  too. So in Schiller's parlance, it's quote unquote, social networks and search engines.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.760]  Yeah. In reality, it's Facebook and Google and it's really no other, no other social networks
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.680]  are really big. Twitter has a little bit of it. And, and when they first launched it,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.080]  I think a lot of people were optimistic about it, but it talk asking a few people, it seems like
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.600]  Twitter is nothing compared to Facebook with regard to being able to pay for placement to
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.560]  get app downloads. Yeah. I would say it's Facebook and Google, Facebook and Google. Uh,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:48.800]  to me, the question is, will developers get any good data from Apple on their campaigns?
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:55.120]  Will they be able to see which keywords drove users? Will they be able to tie those users to
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:03.440]  any other analytics to tell paid user cohorts versus organic? Um, I'm really curious about
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:10.320]  that. I think so. It's, it's, I, I, I think that the answer is yes, that you'll be able to see if
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:15.440]  a certain keyword worked or how many came from it. Um, they also have an interesting option where
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:23.440]  you can just say, here's what I'm willing to pay, uh, and let Apple pick the, the terms that,
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.240]  that would be relevant to your app. And you don't even have to pick the search keywords,
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:35.360]  let Apple pick them. And you only pay per, uh, so I don't know whether to say click or tap,
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:41.040]  but since iOS is more popular than Mac OS, I'll say tap, pay for tap. So as a developer,
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.880]  you only pay if your ad is shown, but the user doesn't tap it, you pay nothing.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.920]  You only pay when the user actually taps on it. So if you figure out what, what, you know,
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.400]  what conversion rate you think you can get for everybody who actually taps on your app,
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:01.680]  uh, and they even have a calculator for that to help you figure out like, uh, what you should
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.440]  be considering your highest bid in the auction to make sure that you'd be profitable. It seems
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.040]  like they have tools like that. And I think that, that the reporting tools are, um, probably pretty
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.560]  good. We'll have to see. Yeah. I mean, to me, so the, and then there's always users who will tap
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.840]  the ad and then not download the app. And then there are people who will download the app and
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.880]  never launch it and then they'll launch it once and then never again. So, uh, what I don't know
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:33.680]  is, will you be able to identify which of your users were acquired through app store search ads?
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.280]  Oh, I don't think so. Will you be able to compare them? Yeah. I don't think you'd be able to do
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:43.760]  that because it's so there, there are so many privacy related things. Yeah. So I don't. Will
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.800]  you be able to target users that have a competitor's app or something like that? Uh,
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.840]  I remember hearing once that the, I had let you target users based on what, maybe either
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.720]  what apps they had or what songs they had purchased from iTunes or something like that.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.760]  Uh, I don't really remember though. Yeah. I don't know either. And I there and there's,
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.560]  you can definitely target by location and a user can opt out of that. You know, it's part of the
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:16.400]  use location services and you can go to the settings and opt out. Um, but that is interesting
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.680]  to me. You know, it's, I, I'm not quite sure. I'm not sure I can think of a perfect example
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.040]  for where it would apply, but, um, that seems pretty interesting. But those are the sorts of
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.720]  things that like as a, as a developer, you would want to have that access, but Apple's privacy
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.760]  focus might prevent you from, from having that access. So, right. And I'm thinking about,
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.720]  you know, like something like, uh, I don't know, like, uh, like if a conference has like a
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.240]  conference app that the location thing could help, but on the other hand, that also seems like the
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.920]  sort of thing where, where you shouldn't have to pay at all because the search terms should
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:58.560]  absolutely, you know, if you type in recode re recode conference, the recode app, if you guys
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.080]  had an app, I don't know if you did, but if you did it, why in the world would it not be the
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.880]  number one result anyway? Yeah. I think we had a web app this time that, that actually was very
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:14.640]  nice. So actually surprisingly nice, like for a web app. Yeah. I think, uh, I mean,
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:22.560]  so kind of zooming out a bit, I think it's interesting that they went for the strategy of
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:31.120]  announcing these things first. Um, my guess is that none of these would have made the key,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:39.760]  maybe the subscription pricing may have made the morning keynote, but probably not the ad stuff.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.240]  I think review times would, because they could cover it quickly. And I still think that I still
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.760]  think they'll touch upon it. I think they'll, I think they'll say, as you've, as you've probably
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.640]  heard last week, you know, we've made some changes to the app store. It lets them, here's what I
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.920]  think they're going to do. You know, it's like the typical Apple keynote style where they'll
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.920]  introduce it. And then at the end of the segment, they'll, they'll review what it is. We just,
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.280]  you know, here's what we're going to tell you. Now we're going to tell you now we're going to review.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.160]  They can skip all, but the review and just say, as you've probably heard last week,
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:15.200]  uh, we've put new systems and tools in place to let app get app reviews to 50% within 24 hours
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.560]  and 90% within 48 hours. And then the crowd will go nuts. And then cheer, um, we're adding
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.320]  subscription prices to all app categories, uh, and 200, uh, price points for subscriptions,
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.080]  um, and territory based pricing. Uh, I, we didn't mention that, but that's, I, I've heard,
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:39.840]  and I'm, I try not to be us centric, uh, but I can't help but be sometimes, but I've heard
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.640]  from a couple of people that, that this territory based pricing for subscriptions could be huge.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.320]  And the fact that it wasn't allowed before was really problematic that effectively the old way
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.800]  was you'd set a price. If you set it in dollars, that the price in China would just be the
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.240]  conversion rate between, you know, China's currency and us currency. Whereas now you
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.120]  could set a dramatically lower price in a country like China and India, um, where, you know, your
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:13.040]  us price was completely out of reach of most people. Um, and apparently this is something
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:19.360]  that is a huge deal. Um, and it could make, you know, subscription to even content based services
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.840]  a lot, uh, a lot more interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, if you imagine
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:30.880]  Netflix has a smaller library in many countries, maybe would want to charge a, you know, a locally,
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.600]  whatever the local equivalent to eight bucks a month is as opposed to the direct
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.360]  conversion of $8 a month. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, I don't know. I could see this stuff being
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.080]  in the keynote, but I can see how if the keynote was deemed full, that these were the things that
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.880]  were, let's just announce them a week in advance. Like I could see it both ways. Like if there was
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.240]  room, I could see holding them for the keynote. If there wasn't none of them are that blockbuster
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:04.640]  of a, of a, of a thing that much of a blockbuster, they'll have enough to go over with the, uh,
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:15.520]  the arm based Mac OS to, uh, I mentioned that as an example, I mentioned something like, like, uh,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.960]  you know, that apps break over time. Like, like power PC apps don't run on Intel max anymore. And
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.560]  that I, something like that could happen again in the future with Intel to arm. Uh, and that was not
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.280]  one of my coy little, I know something is coming. I have, I don't know. I have not heard one thing
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.400]  from one person that arm based max are a real thing. I just common sense tells you though,
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:41.600]  that it might, it might be a thing because I think Apple has good reason to be unhappy with Intel.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:48.720]  Intel seems to be late with everything from mobile chips to desktop chips. Um, Apple would surely
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.960]  like to have it under control under its own control. And the existence proof is there that,
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.640]  that there are benchmarks that show the iPad pro outperforming the, the new Mac book one.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:04.960]  And it's at least roughly on par in terms of just pure CPU performance. So the possibility
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:14.480]  of arm based max is real. And when they did the Intel thing back in 2006, um, they announced it
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:20.080]  at WWDC, not with hardware that you could go buy, but they pre-announced it at WWDC so that
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.880]  developers could start thinking of, you know, get the tools to recompile their apps to be,
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.560]  you know, fat binaries with native arm and Intel code. So if such a thing were to happen,
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:37.040]  it, it, it wouldn't be, it would actually be, uh, there's precedent that they might announce it at
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:45.760]  WWDC nine months before the machines actually ship. So who knows? Huh? All right. I'm all for
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.440]  it. I think that'd be great. I, you know, I do too. I don't know. I think it could be, I think
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.000]  it's gotta happen eventually. I don't know. It might just be, uh, you know, three, four years
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.160]  from now. And it's like, wow, maybe it just took a while for, you know, maybe they really wanted
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.920]  those chips to be super fast before they do it. But I just think, you know, I just think it could
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.840]  happen eventually. I just think, and it just seems like something Apple would like to have under its
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:17.440]  own control. So we'll see. I don't know. What do you think of this, uh, this week's rumor about
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.400]  iMessage for Android? That's in my notes. So that's an interesting thing at a meta level
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.120]  because it came from Mac daily news, who is not really known for breaking rumors.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.040]  Mac daily news is sort of a mysterious website to me because I don't know who,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:37.520]  there's no byline on it, but it's been around forever, forever. Yeah. I mean, like I longer
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.120]  than daring fireball, I'm pretty sure, but I don't, I don't know who runs it. It's a weird
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:50.560]  little site. Uh, Apple to deliver iMessage to Android at WWDC. This was, uh, yesterday.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:56.000]  Apple will announce that iMessage encrypted text messaging is coming to Android users at WWDC.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.440]  Next Monday, uh, according to a source familiar with the company's thinking, this will make it
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.880]  possible for Android and iOS users to communicate securely as iMessage features end to end encryption,
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.840]  uh, blah, blah, blah. The source notes that plants are constantly in flux leading up to Apple
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.720]  keynotes and the timing, the announcement could change, but that the iMessage instant messenger
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.240]  service would quote, definitely be coming to Android this year. Um, and the other thing he
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.320]  says is that, uh, cause there's a separate rumor that Apple is going to allow person to person
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.680]  Apple pay payments via messages. That's, that's been around for a while and it's just common sense
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.040]  that Apple has a payment service. Apple has a secure messaging service. Uh, why wouldn't they
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.640]  let me send you money through iMessage? Uh, no, I think I question about that. This is a great
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.160]  topic. I've been, I definitely want to talk about it with you. The payment thing though is what
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:59.040]  confuses me because I thought the so much of Apple pay was tied to the hardware in the phones, you
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:06.800]  know, the secure enclave. Well, and to me, the bigger question is the fact that it's connected
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:15.920]  to the credit and debit card network, which has a cost to it. So if you look at the free person to
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:24.960]  person payment systems, they're mostly go through, uh, bank transfers, ACH bank transfers. If you do
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.240]  want to use credit or debit, you usually have to pay, although I think square cash is free, but
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.320]  squares in the position to lose money to get new users. Whereas that's not really an Apple. Right.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:42.000]  So they're eating those transaction fees. So you wouldn't just be able to, you know, I couldn't
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.360]  just send you a hundred bucks and put it on my chase visa. That would cost Apple, you know,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:54.800]  whatever, like three or three bucks. So they're not going to do that. Um, I don't know. I, you
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.800]  know, and one of my colleagues reported earlier, Apple pay is interesting. I mean, one of my
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.280]  colleagues reported earlier that they would also be working on Apple pay for mobile web. Uh, I
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.080]  don't know how that would work. Would that be, would there, you know, how would that launch and
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.800]  how would, how would Safari access the secure enclave? Um, you know, going back to the iMessage
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:21.520]  thing, if iMessage is a marketing tool for selling iPhones, and I think that's how you maybe
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.040]  described it in a, in a previous show, uh, it doesn't make sense to launch it on Android, but
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:35.040]  if iMessage is suddenly a platform for payments for potentially bots for all sorts of stuff, then
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.240]  yeah, let's get that on as many devices as possible. So, and then, you know, maybe even
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.080]  get a few of those Android users, uh, much like Apple music going, Oh, this, these Apple services
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:52.240]  are kind of cool. Maybe I should just get an iPhone and log right in. Um, so I, I've long
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:59.120]  been curious as to when there would be some sort of iMessage platform, the way that, uh, Facebook
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:05.920]  messenger is opening up the way Slack is. And you can kind of see, I believe Apple itself uses
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:13.840]  iMessage through some sort of server, because when you buy, uh, if you use, if you buy an Apple
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.680]  product through their Apple to the Apple store online and then pick it up in a store, they send
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.360]  you an iMessage saying that it's ready for pickup. So, and I don't think that's someone sitting at a
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:31.680]  Mac or an iPhone typing that in. So Apple obviously has a backend to send iMessages
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:39.040]  through some sort of server queue. So the question is how, how rich is that? Are those APIs,
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.560]  is that the kind of thing that they would ever open up to third parties, the way that again,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:51.120]  Facebook messenger line, all these other services are becoming, uh, WeChat becoming platforms for
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:57.680]  bots and for, for other person to machine communication. Uh, I don't know where that sits
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:05.040]  for iMessage, but I think it could be really interesting. And I know there's a lot, this broke
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.000]  yesterday and most people asking me what I thought were very skeptical of why would they, you know,
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.880]  this seems completely opposite of Apple. And, and, you know, maybe iMessage even was this all
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:22.640]  previously was a premium messaging service, you know, just one of the nice things you get as an
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:30.960]  iPhone and Mac user is you get this nice messaging service that's end to end secure. Um, maybe they're
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.880]  looking past that now. And as you mentioned before, two quarterly conference calls in a row,
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.920]  a main talking point from Apple was that they are a quote unquote, they're now, you know, one aspect
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.840]  of the company that's worth talking about is that they are a services company and a messaging
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:52.160]  service would play exactly into that. And bringing it to Android would be a way to emphasize that.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.760]  I keep thinking when I see like the monthly active users or daily active users for messaging apps,
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:05.120]  like WhatsApp and, uh, what does somebody else, WeChat and some of these other ones, um, that
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:12.000]  iMessage has to be up there in the same ballpark in terms of active users on a daily basis. It has
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.040]  to be that if they, but somehow if it made sense in any way to spin iMessage off as an independent
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:24.160]  company, it would be one of the biggest messaging services in the world. And it would have, uh,
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:31.360]  just by the fact that the demographics of Apple's customers are that they're tend to be, for lack of
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.120]  a better word, richer. They're, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's not just the number of users,
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.160]  the number of users, but the amount of money that they have to spend is, is significant, that that
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.640]  would be a valuable company. Yet so many times when I see, I just noticed it last week with
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.800]  Mary Meeker's internet trends thing, and she talked about the top messaging services in the
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:58.640]  world and iMessage wasn't listed. You know, our, perhaps I'm colored by being mostly Apple focused
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:04.480]  in what I write about, but I really do think iMessage deserves to be treated in that caliber,
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:10.560]  even though it is iOS and Mac only. Uh, I think bringing it to Android would open a
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.760]  lot of people's eyes to iMessage is value as an independent service.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.040]  Yeah. By the way, credit where do I'm now hearing those words in Ben Thompson's voice,
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:26.880]  the iMessage as a iPhone marketing tool. So I think that was Ben who said that on your
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.120]  show a few weeks ago. I'm hearing the, I'm hearing the Wisconsin, uh, tones.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.760]  So how could they make any money at all on this? You know, like what would be the sense of bringing
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:41.360]  it, like bringing Apple music to Android makes sense because the, however many Android users
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:47.440]  are using it are paying for it. So duh, it makes sense, uh, to try. What sense would it make to
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:54.400]  bring iMessage to Android as it stands today? Well, I don't think any, right? Because it would
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.280]  just be that they, they would just be losing money on whatever it costs to develop the app,
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:05.600]  which is probably minor, but they'd be losing on the, you know, the, the, the ongoing cost of
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:11.040]  supporting all those additional messages, right? All the bandwidth of photos and videos and,
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.440]  and all that, I think from when Eddie Q was on the show a couple months ago, I think that at
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.920]  peak that iMessage handles 200,000 messages per second, which is really impressive. I mean,
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:25.840]  it's, you know, I know that, you know, blah, blah, blah, Apple gets services wrong. I feel like it's
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:31.040]  like they always see are the ones they get wrong. And the fact that iMessage does a tremendous
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.240]  volume and does it really well. And in my experience as a heavy iMessage user better and
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.280]  better all the time in terms of like not getting like duplicate notifications on different machines
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.400]  and stuff like that. Um, it, you know, there has to be some other way that they're going to
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:51.440]  monetize it from Android users and whether that's payments or whether that's like bots, you know,
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.240]  from other, you know, like say that other stores could do the same thing that the Apple store does.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.240]  Um, but there has to be something like that.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.720]  So I wouldn't be surprised if that rumor is true at all.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.920]  Yeah. Yeah. I think it'd be, I think that could be really interesting. Uh, you know,
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:14.320]  but you also couldn't argue that that would also be the, the, the first ticket for a lot of people
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:19.680]  to, to get rid of their iPhone and go to Android. Maybe, um, probably not millions of people,
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:26.400]  but there's probably some folks out there who would find switching to Android easier if iMessage
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:33.680]  were there. It really is a good network effect and a good lock-in. But if the idea is to build
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:40.720]  a, you know, a really robust messaging platform out of it, that's for other for,
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:47.840]  for bots and other services, then why wouldn't you want to access it? And I wonder if like
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.760]  some markets like India, which Apple has now brought up several times as a, as a key growth
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.240]  area. And Tim Cook spent time there earlier this year. You know, I wonder if that's the kind of
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.400]  thing where it's like, well, first get iMessage on your Android phone, see how cool it is. And then,
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:09.520]  you know, and then buy a, a, a refurbished iPhone at your first opportunity. But I don't know.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:18.400]  Uh, I, I think that iMessage as lock-in is more effective than iMessage as a reason to get an
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:25.280]  iPhone in the first place. And I've heard stories about like, you know, like teenagers who it's,
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.080]  it's, you know, it's like totally uncool to be getting green messages from somebody. Um,
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.720]  and you know, and there's memes that are out there, you know, where people like on Instagram,
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:42.240]  you know, tweet screenshots of, ooh, gross, a green message. Um, but I can't see how that really,
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.800]  you know, works for anything other than teenagers, right? I mean, who else would be,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.680]  you know, I notice when I get a green message from somebody and I think, oh, that might, you know,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:56.000]  that's surprising that, you know, that's, I wouldn't have expected so and so's, you know,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.880]  to have an Android phone. Um, but I don't really, I don't, I don't think lesser of them,
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:08.240]  right? It's, you know, so I don't, you know, so I do, well, I, I do a little bit. I do. I
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.160]  just think they have bad taste. I don't think of them as a bad person and I don't think they
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:16.240]  should, you know, they should therefore feel bad and go buy an iPhone. I just think, oh,
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.520]  there's somebody who doesn't have, you know, doesn't have the good taste to buy an iPhone.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:26.480]  Yeah. Uh, I, I was lying when I said, I don't think less of them, but, uh,
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.880]  Okay. One, what, uh, my Google reporter, Mark Bergen, I excuse that he has a,
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:35.840]  an Android phone. Oh yeah. He needs to. Yeah. In fact, I prefer him too.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.400]  Yeah. I know Mark. Uh, we rode in the back of a self-driving Mercedes together.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:47.440]  Really? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Um, nice. Uh, uh, I talked about it a couple episodes ago,
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:52.640]  a couple months ago when we were at the Mercedes self-driving outfit out there in the Valley and
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.000]  Mark and I were the two guys that got picked to go together. So we could have been killed
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.200]  together as well. Yeah. Um, yikes. Yeah. If you follow, if you're a Google reporter,
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.920]  you got to have an Android phone, but anyway, I don't think they sell many phones with it,
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.680]  but I think once you have a phone and you're used to using iMessage, it's definitely, you know,
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.600]  if you, if you're like, Hey, maybe one of these Android, you know, maybe there's some stuff in
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.960]  Android that's appealing to me, like not having your iMessage anymore. It seems like, well,
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.160]  maybe I shouldn't switch, but so it would be magnanimous for Apple to offer it on Android
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.520]  as in terms of like, we, you know, we don't want to use this as a, as a lock-in, you know, we,
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.280]  we're confident that people will stick with iPhone, you know, for other reasons. And,
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.880]  and, you know, if you do want to leave, take your iMessage ID, you know, with you.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.760]  I also really do believe that the hassles and I think they've fixed some of these problems,
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.560]  but there were problems that people had maybe still have to some extent where once your phone
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:53.200]  number gets associated as an iMessage phone number, if you do switch to Android and just
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:37:01.600]  pop your SIM into an Android phone, you don't get text messages from people, people. Yeah.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.040]  It's like, you have to remember before you switch to disassociate your phone number from
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.400]  your Apple ID and then switch. And that even there were people who even did it the right
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.640]  way and it still got lost. And they don't, they don't get text messages from iPhone users because
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.120]  Apple keeps trying to send them as iMessages. And, you know, it's a pain in the ass. So.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:30.720]  I think now you can, after the fact, go in and remove an iMessage device from the server somewhere.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.320]  Yeah. I think that's the solution that they can, they they've come up with a way to do that.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.120]  They've given it, delivered some kind of interface to allow it, but it wasn't there before. Here's a
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:45.040]  question I have though, about iMessage on Android is part of the appeal to me, a huge part of the
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.880]  appeal on iPhone is that I don't have a separate app for SMS. That it just, it's just one app and
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:58.560]  I don't have to worry about it. Yeah. And, and, and similarly, I wonder how that new, uh, allo
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.320]  app is going to work on Android where it's not the, I believe it's not the default texting app,
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:11.760]  but it is the new app. Um, yeah, I wonder if you'll be able to somehow select it as a, as the
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:18.240]  main texting app at some point, I would say that we're maybe we're in the minority. I mean, a lot
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:25.440]  of people are already using Facebook messenger and WhatsApp and WeChat as their primary texting app
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:31.040]  mentally. So maybe this is not a, it's big of an issue for them, but I use mostly iMessage.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:38.640]  I do too. Or Twitter DM, I guess. But I, a lot of times I send Twitter DMS and it's like,
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.320]  if it's an ongoing thread, I'm like, why the hell am I, were we not doing this on iMessage?
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:48.640]  It was better. Yeah. Or I won't see it for two days cause I'm running Twitter for Mac and it
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:56.480]  somehow swallows the notification or whatever. But so I don't know. And it's my verdict on
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.960]  iMessage for Android is maybe, yeah, I could see it going either way.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.280]  And the biggest reason I'll repeat is simply the way that Apple's been saying,
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:12.480]  we're a services company, we're a services company. That would be putting their
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.840]  muscle where their mouth is. Right. I wonder what it's like to be on the Android team at Apple.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.040]  And if it's anything like what being on the Mac team at Microsoft was 10 years ago.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.600]  I do. I wonder, I don't know. Or like the people who wrote or I guess continue to
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:38.320]  write iTunes for windows. Yeah. Maybe they're exiled. Could be even another office somewhere.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.280]  It is worth noting though, that Apple music for Android, I mean, I don't have,
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.800]  I've tried it. I've, I've installed it on the Android burner phone I have here, but
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:40:00.560]  it is to my eyes, a much more natural Android style app in terms of UI than any, you know,
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:06.080]  than any of Google's apps are for iOS. Like Google uses their material design language,
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.800]  which is effectively the Android design language on all of their iOS apps. But Apple music for iOS
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:18.720]  or for Android looks like an Android app. It's got the Android style share button, the Android dot,
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:28.240]  dot, dot, uh, and stuff like that. Whereas iTunes famously was not a very windows like app at all.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.800]  Yeah. Or Safari. Yeah. I believe it even had brushed metal at launch perhaps.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:41.280]  Yeah, I think it did. And I used Safari used the Mac. They, they it's like they built like a little
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:47.360]  mini version of cocoa into the app and you use the, the Mac style anti-aliasing, which you could
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:54.160]  get into an argument about which one is a better anti-aliasing algorithm. Apple's was thicker and
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:41:00.560]  fuzzier and Microsoft's was more, a little bit more like pixel perfect, but thinner.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.200]  But the bottom line is that it just, you just stick out. It's like, you know, you're not the
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.680]  platform host, so you should, you know, when in Rome, be like the Romans went on windows,
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.440]  render texts like windows. It's a lot like putting on a stranger's pair of glasses,
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:21.600]  but anytime I saw the Microsoft anti-aliasing it, I just couldn't even read it. Like it was,
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.520]  that's a good way to put it. Right. Or is the cocoa Apple one just felt so,
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.040]  so much more like real print. Yeah. I should mention that by the time so far the plug was
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.240]  pulled on Safari for windows, they had actually fixed a lot of that, um, that by the time the
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.000]  plug was pulled, they were using the windows text rendering. I think they weren't using,
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.480]  uh, brush metal. I think that, you know, it looked a lot more like a windows app.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.040]  Um, but it was too late. It was like, and they never had, uh, marketing money behind it.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.680]  So it just, you know, so I should mention that for anybody who actually did the hard work at Apple,
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.280]  if they're listening that, you know, I recognize that by the end of Safari for windows,
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.200]  you did fix some of those. But anyway, speaking of Google apps, did you see the, uh, the Google, uh,
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:17.520]  motion stills app for iPhone? Yeah. You know, I downloaded it and it, uh, it didn't work.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:25.120]  It just, uh, I must have some weird edge case where it just doesn't like my, my photo library
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:31.440]  or my phone or something. It just would, it would show the, one of the live photos for a split
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.400]  second and then I would scroll and it would just be all blank. So I deleted it. I maybe I should
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.280]  try it again. Yeah, maybe it's a guess. Let me guess. It's not featured in the app store. Nope.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:48.160]  Not featured in the app store despite being a very cool app. And I wonder why that is.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.520]  Hmm. I don't know. You know, one of the things that is different in the app store under Shiller
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.880]  recently is that they changed the featured apps on almost a daily basis. Whereas it used to be like
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.560]  a weekly thing, like every Tuesday they'd roll out a new set of featured apps. Um, yeah. Uh,
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:11.920]  there's a lot more emotion in that regard too. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I think other people
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:19.760]  are getting bugs too. So maybe I'll wait for 1.1 cause here I'm every every downloaded it and
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:28.640]  check access my photos. Yeah. And I like it, it'll do the first two and then it's,
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:35.040]  then I'm done. So I dunno, some weird bug. You'll fix it someday. It's uh, sounds cool though. I
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:43.120]  mean, I, I, I did shoot a bunch of live photos at the beginning of having the six S plus and I
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.200]  haven't recently, but if there were something cool to do with them, I probably would again.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.960]  I shoot live photos by default, uh, just because I've got the 128 gigabyte phone and it's nowhere
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:44:00.880]  near fold up. So why not? Yeah, cool. Yeah. And I turned it off for the storage reasons,
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.600]  but I almost never do anything with them though as a live photo because there's,
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.760]  they're so hard to share. I mean, and it is, it's a curious thing. So the Google's,
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:18.720]  if anybody who doesn't have it yet, Google motion stills, um, it takes your live photos and lets you
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:26.640]  share them either as a video or as an animated gif, uh, which puts them into two formats that
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.880]  you can actually share on like a social network as opposed to the proprietary. And I say proprietary,
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:40.480]  there's nothing that, that at a technical level is proprietary in the, the apples, the, the way
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:48.160]  that it stores live photos on disc, it's just JPEG. And then like an, uh, uh, a sidecar, uh,
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:55.200]  MOV file, like a H two 64 video with the corresponding video. But the way that software
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.520]  would know how to play a live video is, you know, you'd have to, but you'd have to write, right.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:05.760]  You'd have to specifically backwards engineer the way apple is doing that. And so things like social
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.280]  networks like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, don't let you just natively post live photos in a
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.680]  way that if you just post a GIF to Twitter, everybody sees the animated GIF. So, uh,
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:23.280]  motion stills makes that possible. Pick an animated or a live photo from your library,
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.360]  uh, turn it into a GIF and share or save it back to your camera roll to share. There you go.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.080]  Done. Um, but the second thing that it does, which is really, really,
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:41.440]  you know, what levels it up is that they use their, um, super powerful image stabilization
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.160]  stuff that Google has to, to take out the shakiness of the live photos and the before
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:54.160]  and afters on some of this is just amazing. Like it just, you don't have to do any work.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.320]  It just identifies, okay, this is the subject of the photo. It's this person.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:03.120]  The rest of this is all background. So we'll stabilize the background for the entire animation
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:06.000]  and let the, the, just let the subject move around.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:10.320]  And some of the before and afters on this are just absolutely mind blowing.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.080]  But yeah, it's, it's kind of cool. All the stuff Google's been doing with images lately.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:23.600]  Well, and I think this is pretty cool sign of, of sort of it. Cause one of the things that I,
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.720]  I mocked a little bit or took gentle fun poking at is that when Google announced this,
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:33.360]  the comments are just filled with Android users, upset that this is a Mac iOS only app
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.560]  instead of an Android app. Um, and then people would say, well, Android doesn't have live photos.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.040]  And then somebody said that there's like one HTC phone that introduced the same feature under a
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.480]  different name a year ago. So Nina, Nina, the Android does have it. If you have this
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:55.840]  one phone out of the 8,827 Android phones on the market, um, it's just kind of cool that they'd be
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.760]  willing, you know, that Google is willing to make like a cool little iOS app. That's really only
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:06.240]  applicable to iOS users just to solve a problem that now that you see it, you kind of think like,
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:11.280]  why didn't Apple solve this themselves? You know, why didn't Apple see that, you know,
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.640]  these live photos, if, if they're cool, that people are going to want to share them on social
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.800]  networks. So why can't they put it into video or gif file? Yeah. And I mean, maybe they will next
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.720]  week, but, uh, who knows? Uh, but it really speaks of Google being aware of what their business
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:32.640]  model is, which is, you know, reaching all people on the planet with their services and getting them
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.760]  to share more stuff with Google. I got to take a break for another sponsor, but before I do, I want
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.560]  to, I want to just insert like a parenthetical there to rewind about a half an hour to where we
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:48.320]  were talking about subscriptions. Um, do you know how to manage your subscriptions, your iTunes
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.200]  store subscriptions?
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:48:00.960]  Kind of, I think you go into iTunes on a Mac, at least that's how I've done it maybe. And so I'm
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:07.440]  aware of them there. I'm aware of two ways. Uh, you can go to iTunes on your Mac and go to the
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.480]  account menu and then you go to view my account and then you scroll down and there's subscriptions
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.720]  to click another thing. And then you can see your subscriptions in there. They are kind of hidden.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.920]  And then on iOS, you can do it on iOS too. And it's even more hidden there where you go to
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.920]  settings so far, so good. You would expect it to be there. Um, iTunes and app stores.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.720]  And then from there, it doesn't look like there's anything with subscriptions,
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.600]  but you have to do is tap on, it just says Apple ID and there's my Apple ID. You tap on your Apple
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.720]  ID and then you get a dialog that says view Apple ID sign out. I forgot or cancel. You have to say
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:50.400]  view Apple ID. Then you have to type your password. And then if you scroll down, there's a thing that
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.280]  says subscriptions and it'll list all your subscriptions. That's good. And you can do
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.960]  things like cancel them there, but I feel like that's hidden enough. And it's good that they're
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.920]  all listed in a row and that there is, there are at least, you know, in iTunes on the Mac and on
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.720]  iOS, there's a way to get, see, here's everything I've subscribed to through iTunes, but that has to
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.520]  be, if they're going to make subscriptions more of a thing that has to be easier to find.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:20.560]  Yeah. Because, because I honestly think it's not just like, Hey, you're doing the right thing by
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.920]  the user by making it easier to find. I honestly think that making it easier to find will instill
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:34.160]  confidence in users that I'm not going to get in over my head, subscribing to too many apps, like
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:40.560]  in the case that more apps start using subscription pricing now that they're allowed to. I think if
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.240]  users feel typical, people just feel like I don't even remember how many apps I'm subscribed to.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.240]  It's going to make them a lot, it's going to make them naturally and just comment,
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:56.720]  it's just common sense that they'd be resistant to signing up for another one. Just wanted to
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.680]  throw that out there. That, that feature does exist, but I think, and I've just asked a couple
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:04.480]  people here and there, like, do you know how to do it? And most people don't know how to do it
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:10.000]  because it's hidden enough both on the Mac and especially on iTunes or iOS. All right, let me
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.920]  take one more break. Thank our third and final sponsor. This is our good friends at Wealthfront.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:21.120]  Wealthfront is an automated investment service with over $3 billion in client assets under
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:28.400]  management. They manage a diversified, continually rebalanced portfolio of index funds on behalf of
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:35.760]  their clients in a low cost and tax efficient manner. They charge very low fees and they take
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:42.160]  every strategy they can to minimize your taxes. In plain English, they make it easier for anyone
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:47.840]  to get access to a sophisticated, diversified, long-term investment portfolio. The idea here is
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:53.680]  this is where you put long-term savings. They do not have high fees and they do not have the
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.600]  very high account minimums of traditional wealth managers. Historically, you needed to invest at
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:02.560]  least a million bucks to get the attention of a quality financial advisor or wealth management
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:08.080]  professional. And then you had to pay at least 1% per year in management fees. Wealthfront charges
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.280]  no trading commissions and is completely free for accounts under $10,000. And I think the previous
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:21.920]  deal, I bet it's still the case, is it's $15,000 if you go through the code that I have for you,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:28.240]  which is wealthfront.com slash the talk show. So you go through there, you get up to $15,000
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:36.080]  without fees. And then once you go over that, over $10,000 if you don't use the code,
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:43.440]  over $15,000 if you do use the code, they charge an advisory fee of only 0.25% per year. And that's
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:49.680]  only on the amount above that minimum. So if you have a $100,000 account and you can also get
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:57.760]  $5,000 more in headroom for referring friends. So if you have $100,000 in your account and you have
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:05.280]  referred six friends to Wealthfront, your first $40,000 is free and you only pay a management fee
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:12.320]  of 150 bucks per year on the remaining $60,000. So in that case, if you've referred a few people,
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:19.520]  it's only 0.15%. It's a great deal. Go there. Their website can tell you so much more about
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:25.360]  how they invest, the strategies they use, the algorithms they use, the way that they can
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:30.480]  optimize your tax bill and stuff like that than I can because I'm not an investment expert. That's
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:37.120]  why you might want to sign up for a service like Wealthfront. So go there. Go to wealthfront.com
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.560]  the talk show and check them out. It really, really seems like a terrific way to invest
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.440]  your money for the long term. What else do you have to talk about? We can talk about what we
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:55.200]  expect from WWDC. Yeah. What do you think is going to be the first thing about iOS 10 they talk
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:03.760]  about? What's the tent pole number one? I don't know. I think that they've done a heck of a job
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:09.600]  keeping stuff under wraps. Yeah. Which is kind of new almost because there were a few years where
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:15.600]  a lot of the big stuff was out by now. Yeah. Even software. I mentioned it on Twitter the
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.680]  other day and a couple of people said, well, maybe it's because Mark Gurman is between jobs
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:29.280]  and that's possible. But he was on the Jay and Farhad podcast the other week with Jay Yarrow
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:38.720]  who's now at CNBC and Farhad Manju of the New York Times. I know that when it was first announced
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:44.960]  that Mark was leaving 9to5Mac and it was unsaid where he was going, I saw a whole bunch of people
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:50.800]  speculate that it was CNBC because it was blah, blah, blah. He wants to be on TV and I choked.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:56.000]  I knew that he was going to Bloomberg so I just quietly guessed. I think people guessing CNBC
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:02.800]  are forgetting that Bloomberg has a TV channel too. But anyway, he was on their show and he
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.600]  talked a couple of things. It didn't seem like he was holding back. It just doesn't seem like he
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.520]  knows much either, but maybe he didn't dig as much as he would. I don't know. It's possible,
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.720]  but we don't know. Gurman said this, I've heard this too, that there is some sort of
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:24.320]  visual refresh to iOS 10. Not like a radical one, like when we went from iOS 6 to iOS 7,
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:30.480]  but maybe more like when we went from Tiger to whatever 10.5 was called. The one where they
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:35.680]  got rid of the stripes and got rid of the brush metal and said, here's the unified window. Here's
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:41.840]  what all windows look like. Like that sort of level of refresh. So maybe the glass panels look
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:46.080]  different or something like that. Yeah. And I haven't heard any details about it, except I
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:52.560]  think it might be a little bit less stark. So not so much everything is either white or dark,
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:58.160]  but maybe there's some more just broader swaths of color. And it seems like Gurman has heard the
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:05.760]  same thing. So that's one. Does that perhaps reflect new hardware color in the future?
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:14.480]  I think it's more like just a refinement. With iOS 7, I think it's safe to say that they really
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.600]  went and just pixel to pixel, just shook the whole Etch A Sketch. They really went back to
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:27.120]  nothing and redrew the OS. And I think that it's just a refinement of that. This is a little too
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:34.400]  stark. I think we can put a little bit more pizzazz into the UI, for lack of a better word.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.040]  I don't know. That makes sense. But all I heard was just that the only thing I can base this on
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:49.120]  is just the word that the UI has been refreshed. I don't know. Do you think that multi-user mode
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:55.520]  will be introduced broadly into iOS? I think for iPad. I think that's a great point. I didn't have
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:02.560]  that written down. To me, that's still one of the biggest weaknesses of the iPad is that if it's
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.640]  designed to sit on the coffee table, that it's still mostly my device, which is problematic.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:16.080]  Yeah. And it doesn't make sense that why not have one that's there and that your significant other
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.800]  or your kid can put their finger on it. And when they put their finger on it, it unlocks
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:27.040]  with their stuff. Oh, great. So now I only have an eight gig iPad instead of 16.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.640]  Yeah. I mean, I think that would be, to me, that's been a no brainer since the beginning,
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:39.600]  you know, and especially since Mac OS has supported that since the beginning of OS 10.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.520]  I think it's a little different with the Mac because the Macs,
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:52.080]  you know, it's different started Mac OS 10 started as a multi-user thing. But yeah,
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:57.120]  you know, but you know, like you said, it's a solved problem. I mean, and the solution would
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.520]  have to be a little bit different because of sandboxing and stuff like that. And whether all
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:08.480]  apps, you know, like, right. Which Apple ID owns the apps for the different profiles. Right. Yeah.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.560]  So there's some, yeah. And I guess, you know, Apple, you know, the, the app store is actually
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:19.840]  one of the complicating factors with that. But, you know, solvable problem. Yeah. And it seems
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:25.600]  like something that ought to be solved. And since they've, they've shown some stuff in education,
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.320]  you know, where there's these education, I don't know how it works exactly, but there's ways for
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.720]  schools to have these iPads where each student doesn't matter which iPad they use. They can just
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:40.960]  log in and use them. It seems like that's, that work is applicable to the consumer market.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.000]  Do you think we'll see a iOS app streaming a la Google?
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:56.000]  I don't think so. I, but then again, I, the Google thing blew my mind. It never,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.320]  you know, it seemed too good to be true. So I don't know, but it doesn't seem to me like iOS
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:08.720]  apps are as compartmentalized as Android apps. I forget the technical term for what you called,
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:15.200]  like the little actions within an app where you could just download the one little,
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:21.760]  you know, effectively just like the sheet for sharing. And I don't know that Apple would do
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.800]  that. I don't know that Apple, you know, I think Apple likes the idea that it's
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:33.280]  a deliberate action on the user to get native code running on your iPhone. I don't think Apple
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.040]  would, I don't know that Apple, it's a neat technical trick, but I don't know that Apple
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:43.040]  wants to make it that easy that you just tap a URL and all of a sudden after it loads, there's
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:48.720]  native native code running on your machine. Yeah. I mean, there's some of that with the,
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:54.560]  what is it like the asset streaming or something for big games or something like that.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:00.080]  Yeah. I don't know. I, I'm trying to think like how technically they could,
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:08.000]  um, put Apple pay into the, to the web browser, which is supposedly a thing. And, you know,
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.960]  is that, is there, is, is the website downloading, uh, a one page app that does the payment? I don't,
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:20.960]  I have no idea. I don't know. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if we see payment information,
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:27.520]  uh, you know, maybe web payments, uh, user to user payments through iMessage. You know,
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:31.200]  we mentioned that when we were talking about the Android, uh, iMessage rumor.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:38.880]  Um, I just had another one in my head. Forget it though. What else are you thinking?
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:45.280]  Hmm. I don't know. I really should spend more time thinking about this sort of stuff.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:52.560]  Uh, I, it's hard because I feel like, you know, they must have a lot. I mean, and I mean,
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:56.640]  that's actually what Schiller told me on the record was we have so much for the keynote
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.600]  already that we wanted to get some of this out a week in advance, you know, and, and, you know,
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:05.760]  the, the, the devil's advocate take on that is that they knew that some of this stuff might be
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:10.320]  a little controversial, like the ads and search. I don't think subscription pricing is controversial,
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:13.520]  but it's certainly something to talk about. And maybe they just don't want people talking about
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:19.760]  that. They want people talking about these other more feature oriented things. Right. Um, so there's
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:24.640]  that too, but there must be stuff there. I mean, so I'm sure they're gonna talk about the Siri
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.840]  stuff, right? We have a good sense that that's happening. Right. And Gurman said, I've had the
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:34.160]  question of, well, okay, so there's going to be an API for Siri, but what, where, where does that go?
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:40.560]  You know, and Gurman's thing was that it's, you know, and this makes sense. It's the easiest way
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:45.360]  I think to do it is that it would be part of the iOS app, you know, that you'd, you're, you're,
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.840]  you know, your app, an app for the iPhone could have a component that is a Siri extension,
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:58.800]  like in the same way that when you have a, uh, uh, third party keyboard, how do you install
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:03.120]  a third party keyboard? It's an app. There's an app that it, you know, has the extension.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.920]  Well, so there might be an easy answer to this, which is something that I thought of
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:13.440]  a while ago and, and have now successfully failed at reporting out, but how does it work
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:20.080]  on the Apple TV? How does Netflix integrate its library into Siri? Because it has. So
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:25.520]  how does that work? Do we know how it works? Technically? I think so far it's a partner
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:30.480]  by partner basis. Technically. How does it work? Are there, is there a database they're exposing?
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.720]  Does their app have an extension into the Apple TV's Siri? You know, if you deleted
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:43.440]  the Netflix app, would it not search? I don't see would not search through Siri on Netflix.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.080]  Yeah. It wouldn't search through. It must be, or I don't know if, if the extension is in the app
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.480]  or if it's just that the extension is in the OS, but it knows if Netflix isn't installed,
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.920]  don't bother looking. Right. So that might be a model of how it works on the phone, but I don't
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:06.240]  know. Um, I get the feeling, I don't, I, and I just have a, it's just the hunch. I don't know
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:13.920]  that the series stuff, it either, either the Siri extensions are more robust than I'm able
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:22.240]  to imagine or, or there's more Siri news than just the extensions. Like I just, my, and again,
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.080]  this isn't like somebody told me, you know, Hey, there's a whole bunch of Siri stuff in the keynote.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:32.400]  Nobody just told me a damn thing about what's in the keynote, but like my just Spidey sense is
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:38.400]  that it, Siri is going to get a big chunk of it. I just sort of, because that's where the industry
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.520]  is going, right? Exactly. There's so much going on industry-wide with these AI voices systems.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:51.680]  And Apple really was the first to bring it to the consumer market that they, I would like to think
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.040]  they almost have to have had a lot of stuff that they've been working on for a while and that
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:03.920]  they're going to want to show now. Yeah, I think so. Like, I just think that there's, they're,
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:08.320]  they're too invested in it. And I think that they truly believe it. I really do. I mean that they
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:14.400]  still, you know, put Siri into commercials and stuff like that. Um, so I would expect a lot of
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:19.280]  Siri. I mean, why, why wouldn't they, if, if, if they already have the foundation for it and
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:25.040]  other companies are picking up and running with the ball, then why, why wouldn't they try to be
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:32.320]  the best? It seems like that would make sense unless they've seen something that they no longer
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.960]  believe in it, but it seems like they totally believe in it. So I would hope that they have
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:43.040]  a lot to show, uh, including hopefully things that Amazon and Google haven't thought of yet.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:49.760]  Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, so we'll see. I don't know. Um, so that's part of it. Uh,
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:58.720]  the watch, I definitely expect watch 3.0 to be announced. Yeah. And I realize, I think that
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:09.040]  there's an awful lot riding on much improved watch hardware, which I would very much not expect to
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:17.120]  see until September. Um, but, uh, however much improvement they can do in the hardware. Um, I,
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.880]  there's two, you know, it's, it's too part, too much part of the Apple brand that, you know,
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:26.000]  you're everybody who has an Apple watch, it's still a new watch, right? Like,
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.960]  even if you bought one on day one, it's like it, it given the shipping delays they had,
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.120]  it still may not have even been in your hands for a year, right? I mean, there were people who
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:41.040]  didn't get their, their watch ordered at day one until June last year. So everybody's watch that
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:46.160]  they already own is relatively new. So there, you know, the new version of watchOS has to be
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:52.720]  applicable to the existing Apple watch. Yeah. And my guess is now that they have a year's worth of
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:05:01.440]  usage, uh, lessons and, you know, the, the reality of the app platform, which is that it's
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:09.200]  kind of a failure, um, and probably have had time to study how people use, use the device that
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:18.000]  they may majorly rethink the paradigm of how apps and glances work and, and even like the,
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.800]  the home screen complications. I mean, that was something that even whatever last fall I thought
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:29.920]  would be a big thing and that there'll be all kinds of cool complications that I'd be able to
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:34.800]  add. And there just aren't. Yeah. There's a cool, there's a sponsor for during fireball last week,
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:40.640]  which is a small indie app called streaks. Oh yeah. Streaks. And, uh, it really, really blew
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:44.800]  me away about how clever it was. And it had, it has a really great complication where it's like,
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:49.360]  the idea is streaks is, uh, I think it's streaks app.com. So, I mean, they sponsored this site.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:52.240]  They didn't sponsor the podcast, but I'll give them a shout out cause it's really,
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:56.240]  really good. And I really think people, I will vouch and it really, really well designed.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.040]  The complication is really cool too, but the idea is that with streaks,
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:04.160]  it's like a way to kind of build daily habits. So like, uh, walk two and a half miles every day,
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:09.280]  take your vitamins. Uh, you know, uh, let's just say those are two things you want to do.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:13.760]  So the complication shows up as two dots. And when you complete it each day,
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:17.760]  the dot goes from like light gray to white so that you know that you do it. And then you can,
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:21.920]  you know, just keep track of it. And if you have like six of them, it just arranges them sort of
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:28.800]  like the dots on a, on a dye. It's really cool. Very simple. Uh, and to me, a really clever use,
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.320]  it's one of the few clever uses of a complication I've seen in a third party app.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:40.080]  Have you seen the quartz app complication? Uh, no courts. So my, my former employer courts, uh,
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.920]  uh, had a, uh, kind of a neat messaging based news app that they launched earlier this year.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:53.520]  And the watch complication is a, uh, just an emoji that, that, uh, is a reaction to the
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.480]  stock market. So if it's, so if it's, I forgot, you know, what the threshold was,
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.120]  but at some point it's the monkey with his hands over his face. If it's like really doing poorly,
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:08.880]  or it's doing great, it's, you know, something, uh, that shows some sort of ecstatic reaction.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:14.640]  It was cool. It's funny. That's actually pretty funny. Yeah. Um, they're very creative over
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:17.840]  there. Of course. Yeah. To me, that's the sort of thing that I think they need to improve. Cause
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:22.320]  I feel like a year in the things that the watch, I have lots of complaints and I really need to
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:26.400]  write up a detailed view of it, but at this point, I might as well wait to see what they have in 3.0.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:31.200]  Um, yeah, but I feel like just talking to lots of people, notifications are a real thing and
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.520]  people like getting notifications on their watch and people like being able to react, you know,
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:41.680]  deal with notifications in some way from the watch. Um, and status updates, right?
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:47.120]  Like dark sky is a pretty cool thing on the watch and getting an alert on your watch that,
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:52.640]  Hey, it's going to rain in six minutes is useful. So that's like a combination of two things. The
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:57.360]  watch is pretty useful for status. The status is the actual weather is about the change,
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:01.920]  you know, and the status of the stock market, the status, the temperature outside. Right.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:07.600]  Um, and then the notification is actually useful to like notification status and,
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:12.800]  and the fitness tracking and health tracking absolutely is a popular feature. And I don't
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:17.360]  know that the watch presented the best way, but it it's a success story for the watch.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:23.200]  And a lot of the other stuff that really wasn't the message they gave us a year ago.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:28.560]  Right. And you know, I don't know if they knew, uh, I don't think so. Right. Another one. And I,
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:35.120]  I would assume that they would show it off, uh, during WWDC because it would probably be part of
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:41.920]  iOS 10 would be my, you know, my, I would say my number one request would be a more robust health
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:49.840]  app. Um, now I have a year's worth of data on here and yes, that screen with the little loops on it
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:55.360]  was fun. The first few times I looked at it, but there's probably a lot more you can tell me about
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.760]  trends or, you know, Hey, uh, Hey, Hey, fat ass, you know, you, you don't exercise on the weekends
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:08.400]  enough. What's wrong with you, you know, that kind of stuff. Um, and I'd love to see a better health
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.600]  app. And I would guess that based on the, you know, what you hear about the teams that they
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.080]  have there, that there's something coming for that. Right. It's almost to me like a,
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:24.480]  a data visualization design problem, not even almost that's what it is. It's okay. So, so
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:32.320]  because of the watch, you've collected all of this information over a year of time, but you're not
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:38.880]  showing it to me in any way that, that gives me any kind of a trend or a story or a sense of myself.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:45.440]  And I feel like that, that that's something to watch could do and should do. Yep. And actually
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.480]  it looks like it has been updated a little cause now I can see workout stuff. You know, I, I don't
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:54.640]  have a reason to go to this app every day and I really should. Why not? You know, I'm, I'm
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.840]  tracking this data every day. I should probably be reviewing, reviewing it and, and gaining some
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.240]  access, some knowledge from it. And this is something that I think, uh, Jawbone tried to do.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:11.360]  And it's, you know, the trends they would notice were, were very kind of not really revelatory. So
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:18.480]  I, this was before Apple watch. So I never really stuck with the Jawbone system, but
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.800]  I would really hope that there's a lot more that Apple is going to do here.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:28.800]  Uh, I really hope so too. So I'm very interested to see the watch related announcements. I would,
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:34.400]  I, again, this is a pure bet. I'm not cheating. Nobody told me anything, but I would definitely
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.320]  bet money on a nice chunk of the keynote going to watch. Yeah. That makes sense. Since it is one of
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:47.200]  the three, I guess, four major platforms now, um, assume there'll be some Mac stuff, but probably
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:53.760]  not too much. I think that's what I think too, but I would love to be surprised. I know that the Siri
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:11:00.640]  coming to Mac, but that to me sounds like it's just integrating voice search with spotlight
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.840]  search, you know, and I just see, it almost seems overdue. It seems like if my phone can do Siri,
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:15.200]  why can't my Mac? Yeah. Uh, maybe some tvOS stuff too. I wonder about that. I honestly do. Um,
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.080]  it's it's, it also maybe seems so new that maybe there isn't a ton to add to it.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:26.640]  Yeah. I can't, that could be hardware dependent. Yeah. I can't see them not mentioned. Excuse me.
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:34.560]  Can't see them not mentioning it, but I, I, I don't know. It would be cool though. Uh,
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:37.760]  but they're not going to have new hardware. So I feel like they're kind of limited
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.920]  to what they can, what they can do.
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:48.160]  I wouldn't be surprised to see something globally about notifications, just cause
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.600]  that's such an important part of the user interface now. And maybe that's the kind of
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:57.760]  thing where they've done a lot of work on all the platforms too, to, you know, for last year,
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:03.760]  they, they let you organize them better. That's been nice, but I think there's still a ton more
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:10.000]  they could do there. Uh, it, it has really revealed itself as a, you know, one of the
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.080]  most important user interfaces in mobile. So yeah, I bet there's, I bet there's something
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:22.560]  coming there. I would, I would assume, I don't know. Uh, one of the changes this year,
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:30.080]  because they're having the keynote at the bill bill Graham civic auditorium and they
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:33.920]  send out invitations differently. They don't do like a theme anymore. There's no slogan
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.440]  or anything like that. So like the guessing game where people, we would just try to backwards
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:42.240]  engineer from the slogan they gave and the decoration to, well, here's what they must mean.
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:49.040]  Uh, uh, they don't have that anymore. No. Did you see the photos though of someone, uh,
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:57.440]  installing, uh, what looked like air conditioning, like temper temp. I watched the IO thing a few,
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:03.040]  like a week later and I, you know, it's like the whole thing is outside. Really? That's crazy.
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:08.240]  Yeah. And it seemed like they really got for, for the Valley for mountain view,
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:14.720]  they really got bad weather. It was unseasonably hot. Huh? Yeah. Sure. A lot of sunburns. Yeah.
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:19.280]  Mac rumors has some pictures of the bill Graham civic auditorium. They put an Apple logo up front
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.520]  and center that kind of makes it look like the whole thing is an, a gigantic Apple store. It's,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:29.840]  but it's just an Apple logo. And then they put, uh, uh, six color flags out in front,
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:36.160]  which looks pretty cool because then a nice little homage to the old, uh, Apple logo. Oh, cool. But
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.960]  no clues, no slogans, nothing like that. Uh, so there's nothing to go on. Hmm.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.520]  Yeah. And, and, you know, you got to imagine they'll also spend some time probably talking
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  about the new Apple music. I, and, and maybe, so maybe is this one we'll get a redesigned iTunes
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:00.320]  for Mac. I think maybe, I don't think it's gonna, I don't think there's ever going to be a, uh,
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.960]  a major rewrite of iTunes for Mac. Yeah. But I feel like it so far they're,
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:13.680]  their attempts to declutter it have been not so great. Something's gonna,
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:20.080]  got to replace that connect tab. Yeah. I wonder though, because the update that did recently ship
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:29.920]  changed some of the, uh, I forget the, what's the version number. Is it 11.12? Uh, about 11.12.4.
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:35.840]  So 1.6, they did change some stuff in terms of bringing back a sidebar and making,
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:41.760]  putting a little pop-up menu there for switching between, uh, TV and movie and music and stuff like
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:47.040]  that. But boy, I hope so. I don't know. But I think that Apple music for iOS and Android is
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.840]  definitely, I mean, this is a bunch of rumors to this front, but that, you know, definitely going
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:56.240]  to get a simplification because it just seems like it's universal that people are confused by how it
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:03.520]  works. Yeah. Uh, what else they might have to change? I don't know. And, and I've said this
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:13.920]  before, but I really do mean it like as a, just as a canary in the coal mine, I found the, the
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:22.320]  Apple music presentation last year to be alarming because a sign of Apple losing its way post Steve
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:28.080]  Jobs. Uh, and again, I think I, I, my reputation as somebody who doesn't throw about this wouldn't
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:32.000]  have happened if Steve Jobs were still around. Like I don't overuse, I don't hit that button
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.520]  very frequently, but that music presentation and last year's WWDC keynote, I hit that button.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.040]  Like that, that would not have happened like that if Steve Jobs were still around,
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:46.160]  it wouldn't have gone on so long. It wouldn't have been meandering. It wouldn't have seemed
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:52.720]  under rehearsed. Um, and it would have been more focused. So I'm very interested to see if,
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:55.840]  if they solve that problem this year, because otherwise it seems to me that there's some
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:01.360]  kind of communication problem within the company that there's this division that can't communicate
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:09.600]  itself clearly. Yeah, that was weird. Are you coming? You're coming, right? I am. I'll be there
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:16.960]  for, uh, about 24 hours or a little longer than that, but I have to leave Monday almost right
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.160]  after the keynote to go to a company meeting. That's right. We talked about this cause I
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.960]  invited you to come to the live episode of, of the talk show, but that's not until Tuesday.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:34.000]  No, I won't be there. Unfortunately. I'm excited. I got Saturday, Sunday, Monday too. So four days
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.360]  from now I'll, I'll be doing the live talk show. Can't even imagine who's going to be the guest
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:51.200]  this time. Uh, working on it. Yeah. Monday you'll ask, uh, actually I think this is the first time
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:56.000]  you've booked me this far in advance. I did. I'm trying to do this. I'm trying to book people
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  further in advance because it's trying, I'm trying, you know, I've been on a pretty weekly
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.840]  schedule too. Um, and they've been great. I've really enjoyed the shows recently. All I'll say
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:09.760]  is that one of these years, the live episode of the talk show is going to have a disappointing
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:15.040]  guest because the last year by having Phil Schiller, the bar clearly got raised. Um,
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:21.360]  it can't get raised much higher though. And yeah, you better have Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:26.480]  All my money back. Right. Um, so all I'll say is that one of these years I'm going to,
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:31.840]  the very special guest is going to be molts. Nice. And it might be this year. We'll have,
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:39.440]  we'll have to see on Tuesday. That'd be awesome. Anything else you wanted to talk about? Um,
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:46.640]  no, I can't think of anything. You know what? I will say that, uh, the reviewers blew it.
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:52.800]  The new 12 inch Mac book is a huge improvement over the previous one. And I love mine.
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:56.400]  That's interesting. What do you think that they blew? Was it that just the overalls that
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:00.160]  the consensus I got from the review? I have not used one. The consensus I got was,
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:05.920]  I can't believe this is the improvement. And that was my first reaction to when I saw that it's only
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:13.440]  15% faster, but whatever it is, that 15% is the difference between waiting for the computer every
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:19.520]  single time I wanted to do anything and feeling like, okay, this computer is as fast enough to,
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:27.600]  you know, is as fast as my brain. Um, well still a little slower than, than I'd like it. And there,
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:34.240]  you know, it still chokes on things like Chrome and Google maps and random stuff and,
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:40.560]  Oh, the new Twitter for Mac app. Don't even get me started on that. But, uh, I use it,
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:46.480]  you know, as my secondary computer most of the month. And then the week that I'm in San
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:51.840]  Francisco every month, it's my main computer. And it's way, it's way noticeably faster than
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.760]  last year's and, um, is a great computer, a really excellent computer, especially if you travel.
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:02.880]  And I'm very happy with it. I wish it were a little faster and, you know, it's still
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.520]  kind of on the expensive side. Um, and I definitely, do you get good battery life out of
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:13.600]  it much better this time than last time, although I've switched back to Chrome from safari, which
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:20.720]  hurts battery wise. Um, but, uh, I've also been just keeping it plugged in on the plane.
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:26.960]  So that hasn't really been too much of an issue, but the battery's fine. I'm not worried about
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:35.120]  the battery. I bought a couple of these little USB hub, HDMI thingers, and they kind of help
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:39.920]  plugging other stuff in when necessary, but it's great. It's amazing computer.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.400]  If there were a 14 inch one, I'd probably get that.
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:46.960]  I get the, I get the feeling that, you know, like with the talk to people at Apple about the watch
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:50.400]  and, and they won't say anything, but they nod their head in a, yeah, you know,
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.800]  this is our first attempt and we're, we're learning a lot. And you get the sense that,
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:20:00.800]  that the next watch will be, uh, will show that they've learned a lot. When you complain to
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:05.840]  people at Apple about the Mac book one, as it's called, they shake their head and it's like, no,
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:10.240]  this is the future laptops. Like it'll get faster. Time will take all it needs is time. And, but,
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:14.880]  but in terms of, you know, complaints about the keyboard or complaints, like nobody needs
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.000]  a device this thin, they should have made the battery thicker, et cetera, et cetera. None of
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:26.160]  they just know thinner, yep. Thinner and port and ports are, uh, antiquated, do not need the ports.
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:32.320]  Right. And there's a, there's a confidence from Apple that this product is it. And to me,
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:37.760]  it exactly echoes the original Mac book air, the original Mac book air, the one that jobs took out
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:44.400]  of the envelope was like, I, I, it was like 60 had like a 64 gig hard drive and the iOS was like
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:50.720]  30 gig. I mean, I was running on like an iPod hard drive or something. No, it was SSD. That's
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:58.000]  why it was so small. It was like, it was spinning. Oh, was it? Yeah. It wasn't SSD until later or,
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.320]  you know what? No, no, no. You could buy an SSD, but then it was like three grand or something
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:07.760]  like that. Yeah. It's crazy. It was super expensive, but that they, and everybody was
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:13.760]  like, well, it's ridiculous. It's way too thin. I want a big fat battery. Uh, and they were like,
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:18.160]  no, no, no, we've got, we've got this. We just need time. You know, time will solve the price
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:23.920]  and time will solve the speed and time will increase the SSD size. And they were right.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:28.480]  And I think that it's just the same story all over again. So maybe the Mac book isn't right for
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:34.960]  everybody yet in 2016, definitely wasn't right for everybody a year ago, but you know, they're,
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:37.760]  they're convinced that that's the future. So I'm not surprised to hear that you like it.
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:43.280]  No, I really like it. And I, I can't reiterate like that upgrade. I was very skeptical and
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:48.320]  obviously I, you know, I'd want it to be faster and I guess I should clarify, I got the, whatever
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:57.600]  the five, 12 gig version with the slightly faster CPU is, but not the fastest one, which is now like
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:02.560]  just too expensive. But personally, I don't have it. I still have a 13 and a year old or two year
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.760]  old Mac 13 inch Mac book pro. I, but I use my Mac book pro so much less now that I have an iMac at
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.440]  my desk that I only use it for traveling that by the time I do get a new machine, I think I'll
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:15.360]  probably get the Mac book instead of a Mac book pro cause I really it's, it's great. And by the
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:22.480]  way, so yeah, the first Mac book air had a, uh, 80 gig, 1.8 inch hard drive, or you could get an
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:29.920]  optional upgrade to a 64 gig solid state. That's it. So we were both right. Yeah. So I, I only
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:35.840]  saw the appeal in SSDs, so that's why I thought 64, but isn't it great that the upgrade lost you
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:41.200]  16 gigabytes because it was going to SSD. Well, it was already 1800 bucks. So back then you could
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:48.240]  imagine how much more that SSD would have cost too. I I've still been using the, the 12 inch,
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:53.600]  you know, the, our small size iPad pro the review unit here I have from Apple and I've still been
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:59.120]  using it as much as I can, but for having a, and it's to me roughly comparable to that Mac book
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:06.000]  air. I find that the elegance of just put it on the desk and just flip up the lid to be so elegant
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:12.080]  and the way that I want like a little laptop type thing on the desk and that the, the little flippy
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:18.080]  cover and make a little tent and bend the thing around. Like every time I have to set up the,
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:25.120]  the iPad as a laptop thing, I just think I I'd rather have a Mac book. Yeah. I also,
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:32.560]  I'm not a fan of that aspect ratio for something that size just feels too tall. I don't know. Yeah.
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:40.080]  But, uh, I, I, I'm still very tied to the Mac for productivity. I'm still the
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:47.840]  flipping between four apps and 17 Chrome tabs. So, um, I'm too good at it. It's, it's totally
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:52.800]  understand why other people, uh, who never really got good at the Mac. Like, you know,
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.520]  if all you ever did on your Mac is just open up a bunch of Chrome tabs or Safari tabs, then
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:03.280]  switching to iOS is totally doable. Right. We, it, you know, but I use apps, you know,
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:07.920]  it's like I use so many native apps and I'm good at switching between them. Yeah. Um,
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:14.480]  all right. Your home base is at recode.com. You're the editor. No,
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:20.960]  recode.net, recode.net, recode.net. That's what I meant. Yeah. Someday we'll get recode.com.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.200]  Maybe not though. I don't know. I would just type recode and it'll auto complete because you've
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.200]  already got it in your history. Uh, and you're doing great work there. It's a great staff.
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:37.520]  And on Twitter, people can enjoy your, your musings at from dome F R O M E D O M E. And,
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:41.360]  and you're a very good follow and a long time friend and guest on the talk show. And I
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:56.240]  appreciate it. Hope I see you Monday morning. Yeah. Thank you. Talk to you then.
