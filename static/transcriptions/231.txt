[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  Did I tell you that I figured out what the heck that was? I don't think so. No. So the
[00:06.280 --> 00:10.600]  backstory on this is that Dan and I were in the Steve Jobs theater together sort of towards
[00:10.600 --> 00:14.680]  the back, maybe like five or six rows from the back. And during the event, especially
[00:14.680 --> 00:20.720]  the first half, there was a lot of noise from seemingly like, like, I couldn't quite make
[00:20.720 --> 00:27.880]  it out. But I thought it was like Asian language, sort of like speakerphone noise. And I thought
[00:27.880 --> 00:32.760]  someone was on the phone. And I thought, I completely thought it was somebody who was
[00:32.760 --> 00:39.000]  on the phone, like with, you know, like, like, like Chinese media, and they were on the phone
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.320]  with somebody at their office back in China, like to let them listen to the keynote live.
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.060]  And I'm like, dude, they're streaming it. You don't have to, you don't have to let them
[00:49.060 --> 00:55.260]  listen in on speakerphone, you know, and why are they talking. And it was a bit distracting.
[00:55.260 --> 00:59.440]  And it was also kind of baffling, because I would like turn around to see who it was
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.480]  to maybe shoot them a dirty look. And, and it, it was like, it seemed to like be moving
[01:04.480 --> 01:07.480]  around the theater, like, at first, I thought it was over my shoulder to the left, then
[01:07.480 --> 01:11.400]  it seemed to be coming from over my shoulder to the right. Anyway, long story short, what
[01:11.400 --> 01:18.400]  it is, what it was is that Apple provides non, I don't know how many languages they
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.760]  support. But if English is not your first language, they they give media like a little
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.420]  earpiece, and they can get a live translation from somebody who, you know, that Apple hires
[01:27.420 --> 01:34.200]  to translate it on the fly. And which is cool. But what happened was that they had them turned
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.920]  up way too loud. And I guess there's no volume on on the actual thing that goes in your ear.
[01:39.920 --> 01:43.820]  It's like Apple was controlling it, and it was way too loud. And so what and so what
[01:43.820 --> 01:47.280]  people were doing, because it was so loud in their ear is they took it out of their
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.740]  ear, and we're just sort of holding it. And it was so loud, like, it was supposed to be
[01:52.740 --> 01:56.560]  like an earpiece, you know, so you wouldn't distract people. But it was so loud that that's
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.320]  what we were everybody could hear. It was like, that's how loud it was. And they are
[02:00.320 --> 02:03.340]  funny. And the reason it went away about half an hour in his Apple figured out what was
[02:03.340 --> 02:08.620]  going on and turn the volume down and everybody stuck them back in their ears. I had an amazing
[02:08.620 --> 02:15.980]  meeting once in Tokyo with the I wanted to do a story on the evolution of the Japanese
[02:15.980 --> 02:21.520]  vending machine. And I met with the guy at Coca Cola, Japan who runs all their vending
[02:21.520 --> 02:25.920]  machine operations, which is a fascinating story. And I'm not going to get into the details
[02:25.920 --> 02:31.520]  now. But they in this meeting, and also I think in a few other meetings I've had in
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.800]  Tokyo, someone is an interpreter who sits in the room and you have an earpiece where
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.100]  you can hear her speaking translating into English in real time while you're sitting
[02:41.100 --> 02:45.280]  there in the meeting. It's fascinating. It's very cool.
[02:45.280 --> 02:52.720]  It's like being at the UN or something. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It was I gotta say it
[02:52.720 --> 02:59.760]  was it was, you know, it had been a year since we'd been in the Steve Jobs theater. And
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.880]  it's still really impressive place. Like, I think you probably talked with Neil, I about
[03:04.880 --> 03:12.080]  this last show, but this, I just, the sound blew me away. I wasn't I forgot that they
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.440]  did that they went completely all out with the sound system and the projector and everything.
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.200]  Like that's, it was when they were playing that intro sequence, the Mission Impossible
[03:22.200 --> 03:28.120]  thing, like the room was shaking. It was so the bass was so strong. It's not an obnoxious
[03:28.120 --> 03:30.480]  way either, like in a really, really compelling way.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.920]  No, it's the best sound I've ever heard in the theater. It is literally no echo. It is
[03:34.920 --> 03:48.640]  super crisp. What's that's all right. We love dogs on the talk show. Joanna's dog is always
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.480]  always a problem. What's your dog's name? Ralphie. Oh, that's a good name. I'll try
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.320]  to mute when he's that's all right. He's guarding the door. So that's his job. Yeah, it is his
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.200]  job. No, that's totally allowed on this show. Now it is fantastic sound and I talked to
[04:04.200 --> 04:09.180]  some Apple people and I think that they use it a little bit more internally than I was
[04:09.180 --> 04:14.280]  initially led to believe like I heard from I wrote about how you know what a remarkable
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.520]  place it is combined with the fact that at least publicly they only use like once a year.
[04:19.520 --> 04:23.560]  They do use it internally a couple times a month. They have you know, team meetings and
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.240]  stuff there. I mean, it's it doesn't just sit unused all year long. I mean, they do
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.080]  make some good use of it and I heard from a couple people that they had a screening
[04:35.080 --> 04:42.720]  of The Incredibles 2 and employees were allowed to bring their kids and everything like that.
[04:42.720 --> 04:47.600]  I haven't seen it yet. I love The Incredibles. It's absolutely I go to the theater so little
[04:47.600 --> 04:53.360]  now it's it's criminal. I really it was sort of like a New Year's resolution for this year
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.880]  that I missed. I want to start going to the movies more often again that because I love
[04:56.880 --> 04:59.960]  going to the movies and I don't know why I don't go but I haven't seen The Incredibles
[04:59.960 --> 05:05.880]  2 yet but there's apparently a scene where the little baby Jack Jack is like up in a
[05:05.880 --> 05:09.720]  corner like like hiding. I don't know. I don't know what this is not really a spoiler but
[05:09.720 --> 05:15.600]  he's up by the ceiling hiding in the corner like back right and he makes a noise and the
[05:15.600 --> 05:19.280]  theater it made it sound like he was in the back corner of the theater like my one friend
[05:19.280 --> 05:25.020]  at Apple was like you know me and my two kids we all just turned around and looked up there.
[05:25.020 --> 05:32.560]  That's amazing. Yeah that's cool. How the promise of surround sound. So what's coming
[05:32.560 --> 05:35.660]  up I guess we before we get into the news we can while we're talking about the Steve
[05:35.660 --> 05:40.800]  Jobs theater we can we can speculate on what's coming up for Apple because everybody is expecting
[05:40.800 --> 05:50.120]  them to announce new iPad pros and probably new MacBooks that are not pro at an event
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.920]  which I'm guessing I honestly have no inside information about this. We're recording this
[05:53.920 --> 05:59.420]  on October 15. Nobody has told me a damn thing but I'm guessing it's going to be Tuesday
[05:59.420 --> 06:03.920]  October 30th but the question for me is where are they going to do it in the Steve Jobs
[06:03.920 --> 06:10.280]  theater or are they going to do it like you know like they had that remember we were you
[06:10.280 --> 06:15.600]  there at the Chicago thing. I was yeah yeah at Lane Tech where I took the SAT that's exactly
[06:15.600 --> 06:25.000]  right I forgot about that right. What a small world. The place where you took the SATs was
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.760]  at the I so I don't know I have no idea what they're going to do but I feel like Tuesday
[06:28.760 --> 06:35.520]  October 30th is the right day because it's obviously not going to be this week. I mean
[06:35.520 --> 06:41.160]  invitations haven't gone out yet and I in theory you know they could send out invitations
[06:41.160 --> 06:44.840]  now for something next week but I don't think they'll do next week and I don't think they
[06:44.840 --> 06:52.040]  ever would because next week is like this Friday is when the iPhone XR goes on sale
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.120]  or pre-order and then next Friday is when it ships and I don't think they would hold
[06:56.120 --> 07:02.400]  an event in between there because I would guess that like reviews of the XR will be
[07:02.400 --> 07:06.080]  coming out at some point in between then and there and they're not going to have they don't
[07:06.080 --> 07:11.400]  want to have reviews of a new major new iPhone coming out at the same time that they're announcing
[07:11.400 --> 07:16.240]  new things like it doesn't really make any sense from Apple's perspective yeah I the
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.180]  minute you or so I forgot where I read that that thinking first but that that made sense
[07:21.180 --> 07:25.040]  I mean there was a world in which you know and maybe this would have happened four years
[07:25.040 --> 07:33.180]  ago they would have put out the invitations the day of the Google pixel event they did
[07:33.180 --> 07:40.920]  used to do stuff like that yeah my guess is that you're right the discipline of not not
[07:40.920 --> 07:46.780]  messing up with the the signal of the new iPhone you know no noise about iPads or anything
[07:46.780 --> 07:53.520]  else just keep one story at a time that makes that makes sense yeah so I had to bet I would
[07:53.520 --> 08:00.280]  bet that they'll have it at the Steve Jobs theater again and yeah but that's it's simply
[08:00.280 --> 08:04.540]  I don't know why I think I just know I really don't think that they would ever hold an event
[08:04.540 --> 08:09.440]  at the old town hall on the old campus again I know like why I mean it would seem that
[08:09.440 --> 08:16.480]  doesn't make sense even if it's not supposed to be as big a big deal as you know new iPhones
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.120]  I think new iPads are pretty big you know oh man I'm pumped I'm I need one so I hope
[08:22.120 --> 08:26.360]  it happens sooner than later yeah that's that's a good question like is it more work for the
[08:26.360 --> 08:33.480]  events team to do it on campus or it's probably a lot less work yeah having to do it somewhere
[08:33.480 --> 08:39.080]  else yeah I'd say even if it were in San Francisco or Cupertino you know even if it were in Silicon
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.720]  Valley like it's probably a lot easier for them I think it's a lot less work a lot because
[08:43.720 --> 08:48.600]  it's less travel obviously for everybody because they're just doing their normal daily commute
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.280]  and I think for the whatever you want to call the team that does the setup they don't have
[08:52.280 --> 08:57.160]  anything to set up I mean not that they don't I mean they put up some decorations and stuff
[08:57.160 --> 09:01.320]  like that in the theater but it's nothing like the pop-up theaters that they've been
[09:01.320 --> 09:08.120]  making in recent years at places like the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium and and even
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.480]  Lane Tech High School like that was by far the cleanest day in the history of that school
[09:12.480 --> 09:18.640]  forever forever after like it will never be that as clean as it was the day that Apple
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.840]  event there right yeah I guess there's the argument that like oh keep keep the Steve
[09:24.840 --> 09:30.120]  Jobs theater for only the most important special events the iPhone event but I don't that doesn't
[09:30.120 --> 09:35.880]  really know I don't think that means anything yeah I think it made sense maybe for the first
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.840]  event to be there to be for last year's iPhone you know the biggest event of the year is
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.400]  the iPhone announcement I think it sort of made sense to christen the theater with that
[09:45.400 --> 09:49.680]  event but now it just to me makes sense that you'd use it whenever you have something to
[09:49.680 --> 09:53.760]  announce and the reason they only used it once last year is it was a year where they
[09:53.760 --> 09:57.120]  just didn't have anything else to announce I mean one of the reasons that people are
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.160]  so excited about new iPad pros is that the iPad pros are current ones are really two
[10:02.160 --> 10:09.920]  generations old they sort of skip the whole a11 CPU cycle so I think people are really
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.840]  excited people who love the iPad are really excited about it because it's you know I hate
[10:14.840 --> 10:20.440]  to use the word overdue but they're maybe a little overdue no I think I think that's
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.800]  super fair I mean you know if you look at especially you know not even just in a vacuum
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.320]  but if you look at competition like it's getting better and you know that's not to say that
[10:29.320 --> 10:35.520]  they have to respond to any sort of increased cadence pressure but they there needs to be
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.040]  a new iPad pro like now so and it seems like especially if the idea is that it won't have
[10:42.040 --> 10:47.640]  a home button there's probably more to the story that that's not just going to be a press
[10:47.640 --> 10:54.640]  release update like that I think that commands an event so yeah remember though when they
[10:54.640 --> 11:01.320]  did the Apple watch and I think what was it I forget what year when they announced there
[11:01.320 --> 11:05.840]  was a 2015 when they originally announced the Apple watch maybe it was 2014 but the
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.480]  and they had that event on the college campus in Cupertino what's the name of that college
[11:09.480 --> 11:17.160]  yes I don't know but remember yeah they built like a gigantic I get a literal building out
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.320]  front for the yes hands-on area like they yeah yeah they built the equivalent of it
[11:22.320 --> 11:32.000]  of an Apple store all temporary just to have an open air hands-on area after the event
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.840]  it was crazy I mean even the stuff they do in that Convention Center where they have
[11:37.840 --> 11:46.280]  WWDC is pretty is pretty intense like the I think last summer they had a big demo area
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.640]  and I don't remember now making no making things up but yeah the construction they will
[11:52.640 --> 12:00.440]  do inside of someone else's space like is pretty is pretty intense so to go back to
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.640]  earlier yeah I think that if it if there's going to be something and they don't have
[12:04.640 --> 12:08.980]  a good reason for it to be somewhere else you know in the past they've had like events
[12:08.980 --> 12:14.600]  it like what the maybe I'm blending with Amazon too but like they'll have something at a library
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.920]  somewhere or something like that or you know the education event this spring was at a public
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.680]  high school but there doesn't seem to be a place like that where they would have an iPad
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.120]  event so and they used to have a member they used to have events at the what's that place
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.120]  in San Francisco Yerba Buena Yerba Buena yeah and it was just too small you know it really
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.480]  wasn't that much bigger than town hall I guess it was a little bit bigger but it it it always
[12:40.480 --> 12:46.120]  felt a little cramped and and the hands-on area was always super cramped in there too
[12:46.120 --> 12:49.800]  I remember the one time just talking about how over the top they go at Yerba Buena it
[12:49.800 --> 12:56.940]  might have been the last year that Katie Cotton was still there and they they knocked out
[12:56.940 --> 13:02.340]  a wall like it like the the room where the hands-on thing was at Yerba Buena they always
[13:02.340 --> 13:06.640]  painted or I don't know if they use paint but draped with black so it was sort of a
[13:06.640 --> 13:13.480]  very dark room with spotlights shining on the tables and they just took out a whole
[13:13.480 --> 13:20.600]  wall of the building so that it would be like airy and sunshiny and then just paid to reconstruct
[13:20.600 --> 13:26.040]  it like it wasn't like a removable wall they literally like figured out they wanted they
[13:26.040 --> 13:31.960]  wanted open air they they did the work in advance to figure out like yeah we you know
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.840]  there's no supporting beams in there we could just knock this out and then we'll just rebuild
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.980]  it the next day like that's crazy it's absolutely insane what they spend on these events yeah
[13:41.980 --> 13:47.040]  it's amazing though and it and it shows the it's you know it's just attention to detail
[13:47.040 --> 13:54.560]  and and really why spare any you know I mean sure spare some expense but not you know what's
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.540]  what's a couple what's ten thousand dollars here or there when that's like selling a hundred
[13:59.540 --> 14:05.920]  iPhones yeah speaking of iPad Pro did you see the hundred no sorry that's like selling
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.760]  ten iPhones yeah exactly it's like selling eight of the fifteen hundred dollar ones yeah
[14:12.760 --> 14:18.160]  did you see that Adobe I mean it's sort of a poorly kept secret but that today at their
[14:18.160 --> 14:24.400]  Adobe Max conference they pre-announced Photoshop for iPad right which made me wonder is this
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.080]  something that they announced last time there was a major iOS event or is this something
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.840]  that they will announce at the next major iOS event I would I would eat my I'll eat
[14:34.840 --> 14:40.560]  my hat if they don't have Adobe on stage at this next event yeah and you know what I was
[14:40.560 --> 14:46.520]  actually watching some of the Adobe Max conference today live they had a great live stream and
[14:46.520 --> 14:53.280]  Phil Schiller was on stage for a while yeah which is I can't remember the last time somebody
[14:53.280 --> 14:58.040]  or Phil I can't remember the last time Phil Schiller was at somebody else's conference
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.400]  I think it just goes to show how serious Apple is about wanting stuff like Photoshop for
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.080]  iPad and it's funny because the verge had a really great hands-on preview they got you
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.740]  know they got to play with it's not coming out till quote-unquote 2019 so who knows if
[15:11.740 --> 15:18.360]  that means early 2019 or later 2019 I suspect that it might be a little later I wouldn't
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.800]  I wouldn't hold my breath for Photoshop for iPad in January because there's definitely
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.940]  some it's not just that it's beta it there's there's some features that just aren't there
[15:28.940 --> 15:34.440]  yet like there's things you could like you can tap on it but it doesn't do anything but
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.040]  the verge had a great hands-on and they let their like their production staffers you'd
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.000]  use it and play with it for a while and they had a great video today I'll put it in the
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.740]  show notes with their first thoughts on it but the thing that keeps coming up is both
[15:46.740 --> 15:50.680]  from Adobe and the people who are trying this pre-release version that it's quote-unquote
[15:50.680 --> 15:56.040]  the real Photoshop it's not just a an image editing app that they've put the Photoshop
[15:56.040 --> 16:01.920]  brand name on it it really is Photoshop that we know and love from the desktop running
[16:01.920 --> 16:10.880]  on an iPad which is kind of crazy which makes you wonder why why they're doing it yeah I
[16:10.880 --> 16:18.000]  I that's a good question and I I wonder about that I I think it is a bet on you know that
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.280]  this really is the future and I think it is a really good form factor for a lot of the
[16:24.280 --> 16:30.880]  stuff people do in Photoshop true there especially read you know retouching yeah well the one
[16:30.880 --> 16:34.480]  guy for the drawing the one guy for the verge made a great point just a fantastic point
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.960]  where he was like like taking he had like an image of a sword and he just wanted to
[16:39.960 --> 16:44.560]  to get the background out just to cut cut out the sword and he said this is you know
[16:44.560 --> 16:47.740]  one of the things you can do here you just don't think about it is in you just rotate
[16:47.740 --> 16:50.780]  the iPad you know like as he goes around you know it's like the way when you're drawing
[16:50.780 --> 16:54.360]  on a piece of paper you can just turn it upside down to do another part he's just turning
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.520]  it around upside down turning it left turning it right and it all you know that's something
[16:59.520 --> 17:04.580]  you can never do with a MacBook yeah right so I don't know I and I think you know a lot
[17:04.580 --> 17:12.000]  of the stuff with the pencil is is obviously uniquely you know at least on the Apple platform
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.800]  is unique to the to the iPad platform and it looks to me I mean from watching the Adobe
[17:18.800 --> 17:25.880]  Max thing that they're doing it at a really really high refresh rate like they had a guy
[17:25.880 --> 17:32.000]  doing a demo with simulating oil paint and it just the way that he was like swirling
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.480]  two colors together it it was really just stunning that it wasn't it just looked like
[17:37.480 --> 17:42.480]  a photograph of you know like like high-def photograph of like a Bob Ross type guy using
[17:42.480 --> 17:48.160]  actual oil paint but that's really where the secret you know I mean like it's no good if
[17:48.160 --> 17:51.560]  the latent if there's latency there between the pencil and the thing but it looks to me
[17:51.560 --> 17:57.120]  like they're doing it right so I would guess that's the reason why I you know yeah I also
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.160]  I guess in the era where you're if you're a creative professional you're probably paying
[18:02.160 --> 18:09.720]  for a subscription to Adobe now so it doesn't really matter you know the idea that you're
[18:09.720 --> 18:15.960]  not buying a $20 iPad version of the app you're subscribing to whatever the yearly or monthly
[18:15.960 --> 18:20.640]  subscription is so at that point they should get you using it on every device you have
[18:20.640 --> 18:24.920]  and not just your one Mac or something like that right we could do a whole thing we could
[18:24.920 --> 18:28.960]  do a whole digression on software as a service and subscription versus buying and I know
[18:28.960 --> 18:33.560]  that there are people out there I know because I get email from them all the time I know
[18:33.560 --> 18:38.440]  that there are people listening to us who hate it who just really really really feel
[18:38.440 --> 18:44.800]  strongly that they want to give Adobe you know $299 or whatever and then they get to
[18:44.800 --> 18:51.160]  use Adobe Photoshop version x.0 for as long as it runs on their computer and then choose
[18:51.160 --> 18:57.480]  whether or not to upgrade when x plus 1.0 comes out you know and I you know there's
[18:57.480 --> 19:02.840]  all sorts of pros and cons to subscription but a certain absolute pro is if you're already
[19:02.840 --> 19:08.680]  in you're already paying you know the monthly fee for the the cc the creative cloud and
[19:08.680 --> 19:14.120]  then all of a sudden next year at some point you just get Photoshop for iPad I mean that's
[19:14.120 --> 19:20.560]  totally that's pretty sweet yep yeah now I'm gonna watch now I gotta watch this video looks
[19:20.560 --> 19:26.160]  cool yeah it really is cool and it's I know at least one person is working on the team
[19:26.160 --> 19:33.680]  and it you know it it's the real deal I mean it's top top flight talent at Adobe and it's
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.480]  the real it is the real Photoshop they're not just saying it so that's very cool here
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.680]  why don't I take a break and thank our first sponsor keep this show moving our first sponsor

[22:39.680 --> 22:47.240]  but we could jump right into the Google pixel event yeah I was going to go to but I didn't I
[22:47.240 --> 22:55.700]  did not so I was going to go and timing wise it didn't really work out that great for me they
[22:55.700 --> 23:01.720]  had like it was a Tuesday last Tuesday was the keynote but because they had it in a sort of like
[23:01.720 --> 23:07.520]  it wasn't a very big venue it seems like it wasn't a lot of seating in New York they had a full day
[23:07.520 --> 23:15.520]  of press stuff Wednesday to like where you I just that's what I did I went up on Wednesday and it
[23:15.520 --> 23:19.200]  was it was nice it was a nice little date they had a nice little setup they had like a sort of
[23:19.200 --> 23:24.120]  a big huge I don't even want to call it a studio but a big huge open space there in New York and
[23:24.120 --> 23:30.120]  then they set up a bunch of kiosks and a bunch of little fake rooms they had a fake kitchen and a
[23:30.120 --> 23:35.360]  fake bedroom and a fake living room and then in like groups of three they were taking you know I
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.960]  got paired up with two other people from the media and then we just sort of round-robin go from each
[23:40.960 --> 23:46.440]  station to the next and see everything it was a nice way to do to do a hands-on thing that's cool
[23:46.440 --> 23:55.840]  and I watched the keynote on video it was typical Google keynote way too long way too many people I
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.460]  always say it's so obvious like the one thing Apple does and and it to me it would be like a
[24:00.460 --> 24:05.400]  canary in the coal mine if it ever started going the other way in terms of well you know Apple's
[24:05.400 --> 24:11.920]  really going downhill is with like a company like Google you can see the politics of the internal
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.360]  politics of who gets on stage you know like it it's like well we got to get somebody from this
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.960]  team up on stage so here let's find some reason for them to be on stage as opposed to just sort
[24:23.960 --> 24:29.200]  of telling a story straight through about the products I thought it could have been a much
[24:29.200 --> 24:39.120]  shorter event but the the tablet yeah so they have intrigues you a little bit I just set up my my
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.800]  pixel XL which we can talk about later but yeah well the one thing I'll say this in favor in
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.280]  Google's favor I thought it was a very cohesive group of products to be announced three things
[24:49.280 --> 24:56.800]  the Google the new Google pixel three in two sizes the brand new pixel slate tablet slash
[24:56.800 --> 25:05.520]  keyboard cover and their their new talk to it device with a screen called the home hub and
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.880]  one two three those are the three products they wanted to talk about I thought that they fit
[25:09.880 --> 25:18.560]  together in in a you know an event very well the slate is interesting because it is their first
[25:18.560 --> 25:26.280]  Chrome Chrome OS tablet like but it runs Android apps you know and I know that they've been working
[25:26.280 --> 25:35.280]  on getting Android apps running in Chrome OS for years now and I kind of feel like I kind of feel
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.960]  like the whole I kind of feel like the whole reason maybe not the whole reason but a big
[25:39.960 --> 25:45.560]  driving factor in that is to get it you know to for tablets I think because I think it makes most
[25:45.560 --> 25:50.240]  sense there I don't think we're using an Android app on a laptop makes all that much sense but on
[25:50.240 --> 25:56.160]  a touchscreen tablet type thing maybe it does right unless they do something like the the new
[25:56.160 --> 26:02.600]  OS 10 is it called marzipan or not what are we calling well we have to call it marzipan so we
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.440]  can have something to call it but Apple is definitely not calling it marzipan publicly
[26:07.440 --> 26:15.040]  yeah but we can call it marzipan got it yeah I and my first thought when I picked it up is man
[26:15.040 --> 26:23.640]  this thing is way too heavy this is too heavy and then I did like on the train ride back to Philly
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.920]  I did the I like looked up what the iPad pros way and it's actually only ever so slightly heavier
[26:28.920 --> 26:35.400]  than the 12.9 inch iPad Pro the reason I thought it was heavy as I'm used to the 10.5 inch iPad
[26:35.400 --> 26:40.480]  and they only have one the pixel slate only comes in one size which is roughly equivalent to the
[26:40.480 --> 26:46.600]  12.9 inch iPad Pro so it actually isn't heavy compared to an iPad Pro it just felt heavy to
[26:46.600 --> 26:54.480]  me at first has a very nice screen they're touting it I guess apples are all 264 pixels per inch and
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.680]  then the pixel slate is like 295 pixels per inch so they're bragging about having the most pixels
[27:00.680 --> 27:07.240]  but it's most pixels per inch but it looks good I will say this just tapping around though with
[27:07.240 --> 27:14.440]  the demo apps that they had a lot of it is they had like a text editor like you know sort of like
[27:14.440 --> 27:20.800]  a BB edit you know like a not like a word processor but like a good old-fashioned plain text text
[27:20.800 --> 27:27.240]  editor forget what it was called and I should have asked I wasn't sure and I guess this is actually
[27:27.240 --> 27:33.440]  a good thing I couldn't tell if it was a Chrome app or an Android app but the fonts were just
[27:33.440 --> 27:42.080]  tiny just like I know I've my eyes I'm 45 and kind of have crap eyes but I mean by anybody's
[27:42.080 --> 27:47.440]  standards this was like it was like the small print on a credit card application you know what
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.360]  I mean like when you're signing up for a new credit card and there's like all this like tiny
[27:52.360 --> 27:57.000]  little small print or like the small print when you buy like a iPhone or something and there's
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.640]  like here's how weird here's the warranty it was like it was like four point type and I don't know
[28:02.640 --> 28:06.720]  if it's configurable or not but it seemed it was a weird thing to have on a demo machine you know
[28:06.720 --> 28:14.440]  like ready to go to tap on like this this does not seem thoughtfully designed the other thing that
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.480]  really stuck out to me compared to an iPad the big thing for me is that the keyboard cover that it
[28:19.480 --> 28:27.480]  has real keys and a trackpad and you know I tried playing with it like snapping it out of the case
[28:27.480 --> 28:31.520]  back in and as soon as you snap it out you know there's like a little black arrow cursor for the
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.440]  trackpad as soon as you disconnect it from the keyboard the moment it's disconnected the arrow
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.440]  cursor just goes away and then as soon as you snap it back in and move the trackpad around the
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.400]  arrow cursor shows up again so it's all you know I would really like to see Apple do something like
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.880]  that with the iPad even though by there's no indication that they are because I find that one
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.320]  of the to me one of the things that drives me nuts if I ever try to do like writing on an iPad is it
[28:56.320 --> 29:02.120]  text selection just poking around with my finger on the screen is seems so crude compared to what
[29:02.120 --> 29:07.920]  I could do with a trackpad how precise I can move it and double click on words and how my hand is
[29:07.920 --> 29:14.000]  already right there by the trackpad yeah unless you have us and I guess if you have a stylus if
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.960]  you if you're holding on to the the pencil thing but if you are you're probably not typing too it's
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.400]  not super comfortable to hold that yeah but I don't think why you're typing Apple doesn't let
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.960]  you use the pencil to like move the insertion point around it's like only really meant for drawing like
[29:26.960 --> 29:35.520]  it so it's there's really no good way to select text in my opinion on iOS period it's just it to
[29:35.520 --> 29:42.560]  me is is just a glaring hole in the iOS experience especially in that when you have the whether it's
[29:42.560 --> 29:48.360]  the Apple smart keyboard cover or some any of the various third-party keyboards you can get to use
[29:48.360 --> 29:54.200]  with an iPad it's like when you have it set up like a laptop using your iPad in a rough either
[29:54.200 --> 30:01.480]  very laptop like or roughly laptop like fashion not having a trackpad to me is just a huge it
[30:01.480 --> 30:07.640]  never I never get used to it I mean maybe I'm too Mac centric but it's it certainly seems nice on
[30:07.640 --> 30:13.600]  the Chromebook it's yeah I mean I think that's one of the main reasons I have not like every
[30:13.600 --> 30:21.720]  time I do try to use a an iPad Pro for text model you know for editing basically or writing I
[30:21.720 --> 30:27.880]  immediately grab my MacBook and just go back to that I think you're right it I don't think about
[30:27.880 --> 30:34.800]  it a lot but the the text the cursor insertion and just text selection is pretty bad yeah and
[30:34.800 --> 30:40.880]  you know it's the surface you know there's I guess the the you know the battle for these tablets now
[30:40.880 --> 30:48.960]  is iPad the surf Microsoft surface ones and now you know this it's like a full reset like Google
[30:48.960 --> 30:54.760]  is seemingly really backed away from Android as anything other than a phone OS and this this
[30:54.760 --> 30:59.640]  Chrome OS that runs Android apps is their new tablet OS and you know this is the first product
[30:59.640 --> 31:04.480]  like it you know that ships with that that's their entry in this the other the other two
[31:04.480 --> 31:11.600]  Microsoft and Google all have trackpad support oh wow all right well now we're on right now it's on
[31:11.600 --> 31:19.520]  now who'd you get the sense that they are building this for because 12-inch screen is is not a super
[31:19.520 --> 31:24.960]  portable tablet is this did you get a sense of this is a work device and not a that's it ever
[31:24.960 --> 31:32.760]  on the house thing it's a good question I thought about that too and the other thing too is it it
[31:32.760 --> 31:41.640]  starts at $599 but it goes up to like $1400 $1500 depending mostly dependent on like I think there's
[31:41.640 --> 31:49.560]  you can either get it with like 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage but then the CPU goes up to and as you
[31:49.560 --> 31:56.160]  pay more for a better CPU and this is an Intel device it is not running an ARM chip which is to
[31:56.160 --> 32:05.840]  me interesting yeah but it you know that's Chromebooks Intel I guess I would guess that
[32:05.840 --> 32:14.040]  they are they're just I should probably know but I think that they are but I don't know but this is
[32:14.040 --> 32:19.680]  and you have a you know I don't know I've dropped off you know I just don't pay attention to Intel's
[32:19.680 --> 32:25.960]  chips anymore you know I when I buy a MacBook you know I just there just aren't that many options
[32:25.960 --> 32:30.480]  on the Apple side of things but there's like eight different CPU configurations for the pixel slate
[32:30.480 --> 32:36.160]  and with very different prices and they you get a little bit more RAM if you buy the more expensive
[32:36.160 --> 32:43.880]  ones too so I I do wonder who's buying a $1400 Chrome OS tablet I mean it's it's certainly not
[32:43.880 --> 32:49.720]  targeted at that low-end Chromebook market you know that is like dominating education you know
[32:49.720 --> 32:57.320]  where there's like $199 plastic laptops it's definitely not that starting at $599 I mean I
[32:57.320 --> 33:01.880]  think this speaks to the bigger question you know if you zoom out and look at Google's hardware
[33:01.880 --> 33:08.800]  strategy in general for especially for the phones and seems like this too you just kind of have to
[33:08.800 --> 33:14.840]  wonder why they're doing it the way they're doing it I mean it basically seems like they're they're
[33:14.840 --> 33:21.560]  pushing for the super high end of the market they're trying to compete with and and in some
[33:21.560 --> 33:29.480]  cases seem to be you know very successfully either at Apple's level of of you know blending hardware
[33:29.480 --> 33:35.960]  and software or approaching it they're clearly not going mass-market with these things you know
[33:35.960 --> 33:43.120]  you can see that the pixels are not flying off the shelves they're not super successful commercially
[33:43.120 --> 33:49.000]  even though they are really nice devices so yeah I guess this kind of fits in with that strange
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.640]  strategy I forgot who maybe so uh maybe it was I don't even want to misattribute this but someone
[33:55.640 --> 34:00.360]  said like maybe they're just being a troll by doing all this stuff like they're I don't I don't
[34:00.360 --> 34:05.400]  think so and I there was a couple of pieces I didn't I wanted to link to one maybe I'll get it
[34:05.400 --> 34:10.480]  by the end of this week there was a piece somebody wrote maybe at Bloomberg kind of scoffing at the
[34:10.480 --> 34:16.400]  whole idea of Google doing phones and why are they even bothering this is you know effectively like
[34:16.400 --> 34:21.840]  corporate masturbation because it's it's they're not selling enough of these to make any kind of
[34:21.840 --> 34:29.480]  dent in the market or dent in their bottom line and I disagree with that I I well I don't disagree
[34:29.480 --> 34:35.320]  that that it's a blip financially somebody did the math and figured out that Apple like Apple
[34:35.320 --> 34:41.600]  sells as many iPhones in eight days as Google sold pixel phones in an entire year I'm almost
[34:41.600 --> 34:50.040]  surprised that it's not even more lopsided than that but I think that there's no other Android
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.520]  phones that are like the pixel phones in my opinion I've described them a year or two ago
[34:54.520 --> 34:59.760]  I have a pixel one I skipped the pixel two generation and I've already pre-ordered a pixel
[34:59.760 --> 35:05.200]  three because I like to you know to me it's the most interesting Android device I've described it
[35:05.200 --> 35:12.840]  as an it's an Android device for people who want Android it but they want an iPhone like phone
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.600]  because to me the rest of the Android especially the the high-end market has sort of gone in a very
[35:19.600 --> 35:25.320]  different direction I mean for all the the legal consternation between Apple and Samsung over the
[35:25.320 --> 35:32.640]  early galaxy devices you know you know the the lawsuit that went on for 10 years over the you
[35:32.640 --> 35:39.000]  know look and feel or whatever you want to call it you know and and remember there there was a
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.040]  moment where somebody held up there was a Samsung expert witness on the stand and one of Apple's
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.920]  lawyers held up one of the phones and said here can you tell if this is an iPhone or the galaxy
[35:49.920 --> 35:56.960]  no three and the guy was like no I can't I can't it was seemingly a good moment but I don't think
[35:56.960 --> 36:02.840]  that's like that anymore there's no confusing a gal high-end Samsung galaxy you know s9 or the
[36:02.840 --> 36:06.480]  note whatever they're up to they look very different they have a very different design
[36:06.480 --> 36:13.160]  language they have it both software and hardware they look different whereas the pixel phones I'm
[36:13.160 --> 36:20.040]  not saying they're their iPhone ripoffs but they're they're definitely iPhone like and very
[36:20.040 --> 36:28.800]  nice like I'm holding a pixel 3 XL and an iPhone 10 s max in two hands and they're neither one of
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.280]  them is much obviously nicer than the other one like I'm very very nice devices both have really
[36:35.280 --> 36:42.520]  really impressive screens and I could you know I mean to some extent it probably is helpful for
[36:42.520 --> 36:47.440]  Google to be able to show their employees like hey look at we can actually make this really good
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.560]  stuff too and you can own this and use Android as intended yeah on this device yeah the other thing
[36:53.560 --> 37:00.160]  they do it to me the hardware is definitely iPhone like I wouldn't mind you running iOS on one of
[37:00.160 --> 37:04.680]  those devices just in terms of how they yeah they feel really nice in hand they've always did and
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.360]  especially they've really made it better in the last two years like my my pixel one is okay but
[37:10.360 --> 37:17.920]  there's things about it that I think were mistakes like like the power button they like etched like
[37:17.920 --> 37:23.720]  a ridging on the side and it's just not pleasant I think that because they put the volume button
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.920]  right below the power button I might my guess is the thinking was well let's give the power button
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.240]  this rigid feel so you can tell but it's like you don't need that you just know which one's up and
[37:34.240 --> 37:38.520]  which one's below you know and they've they've gotten away from that you know that's they just
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.040]  feel better now but the other thing that they do with their phones you said the displays are I
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.080]  think the displays are fantastic they're there but they're also to me very iPhone like in terms of
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.160]  color reproduction like they're not super saturated you know like to me the Samsung phones
[37:53.160 --> 38:01.080]  and the LG phones all look ridiculous yeah to me I they're just not to my liking it would they're
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.400]  just so over-the-top oversaturated and it's you know some people like that and I've heard from
[38:06.400 --> 38:10.120]  you know like in China there's a lot of people who really really like that look they like that
[38:10.120 --> 38:16.120]  it's not really a real realistic it's it's like hyper realistic that the pixel phones are like
[38:16.120 --> 38:25.800]  iPhones to me in terms of having a natural sort of color landscape yeah it looks great the man
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.280]  the one thing that really is throwing me off though that the missing gestures from iOS like
[38:30.280 --> 38:37.520]  not being able to swipe backwards and some of this stuff you know I've had it set up for about half
[38:37.520 --> 38:44.120]  an hour so I'll get used to it but or maybe not but it's super weird however that I just discovered
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.800]  something very very smart which is you can I don't know how they do this but you can squeeze the
[38:48.800 --> 38:56.680]  phone yeah and it activates their assistant which is really clever it seems like a gimmick but when
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.040]  I played with it in their hands-on area it works pretty well it's a well and they use haptic
[39:01.040 --> 39:05.200]  feedback to make it feel like you're actually squeezing the phone yeah I don't I don't think
[39:05.200 --> 39:13.680]  I am like I hope but it really feels like I am which is cool I'm agree I just hit it I agree
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.280]  without reading the screen I don't know what they're collecting on me now yeah well everything
[39:17.280 --> 39:27.760]  yeah I don't I so to me that it you asked before who is the pixel slate for I'm I'm not entirely
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.920]  sure about that answer it's not for me because I I don't I'm not a big Chrome user I guess if
[39:34.920 --> 39:40.400]  you're all in on Chrome though and you want a tablet this could be really nice if you're like
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.280]  sort of living the Chrome OS lifestyle I don't know if you live in Google Docs it might be it
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.600]  might be a compelling device I don't know all right and it's a lot by the way like tens of
[39:49.600 --> 39:55.040]  thousands of people in Silicon Valley live in Google Docs all day so yeah I I do see it you
[39:55.040 --> 40:01.840]  know I have an iPad I have a MacBook and you know I use them at different times for different things
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.960]  and but there are I can see how it would be nice to reduce it to one device in some ways like let's
[40:08.960 --> 40:15.920]  say like I'm a notorious tab lever opener you know I've at any given time I've got like six windows
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.920]  each with you know 20 tabs open in them and if I've you know oh I wanted to read that that story
[40:21.920 --> 40:27.000]  that Dan wrote about whatever and I know I've got it open in a tab but I'm on the iPad it's like you
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.200]  can get it out of iCloud but it's like I don't remember which device it was on sometimes and I
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.940]  don't know where to look for it whereas if it's one less device it you know the the tab I have
[40:36.940 --> 40:41.380]  open with the article I've halfway read is is right there even once I've detached it from the
[40:41.380 --> 40:47.200]  keyboard and I'm just sitting on the couch at night so I can see that but I don't know but with
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.940]  the phones I definitely see who the market is and the thing that the thing that really strikes me
[40:51.940 --> 40:59.280]  about the pixel owners and it just hit me this year is I think in some ways that pixel the pixel
[40:59.280 --> 41:07.760]  aficionados right now pixel phone aficionados remind me a lot of being a Mac user in like the
[41:07.760 --> 41:14.760]  late 90s hmm so you know and that was the era when you know there were all sorts of same thing
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.400]  this the same argument like hey why does Google even bother making these things their market
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.100]  shares so low it's all irrelevant they should just give up because the market shares so low
[41:23.100 --> 41:28.600]  that's everything everybody said about Apple in 1995 right that they should give it up you know
[41:28.600 --> 41:35.560]  Michael Dell said you know what he what would he do if he ran Apple he'd liquidate the company
[41:35.560 --> 41:41.640]  and give the money back right shareholders but if you if you like me were a Mac user in the late
[41:41.640 --> 41:47.240]  90s and you really were passionate about the things that the Mac still did even at the edit
[41:47.240 --> 41:54.080]  you know at a technical level when the OS was really behind the times at a user interface level
[41:54.080 --> 42:02.160]  they were they never lost that lead and and it was always a nicer user experience you know the
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.480]  word beleaguered was always thrown around but that's sort of what we felt like and I was never
[42:06.480 --> 42:14.000]  a big you know like remember people would spell windows W I N D O Z E and right right and stuff
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.720]  like that and get in you know every single usenet group what whatever it was it could be about like
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.000]  the weather you know like all dot Philadelphia dot weather it eventually it's gonna break into a
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  Windows versus Mac flame war like there was there was no news group hey those were fun though there
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.720]  was no news group that didn't eventually break into a Windows versus DOS flame war whether it
[42:35.720 --> 42:40.680]  was computer related or not probably the computer groups were the least likely because everybody
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.960]  had gotten it out of their system but I just see it like on Twitter when I see that the pixel people
[42:46.960 --> 42:53.040]  like touting like their their you know photo advantages and stuff like that like I see that
[42:53.040 --> 42:59.760]  passion and I see their frustration that it's not more popular right that they're they're like it
[42:59.760 --> 43:05.120]  just seems like Google should be selling more pixels than they are because it really is a very
[43:05.120 --> 43:10.080]  compelling device and software experience it just doesn't seem right that it's that it's not more
[43:10.080 --> 43:16.240]  popular and I know that's a really good analogy I think Mac users had that frustration for a long
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.560]  time they really did and I see it you know I mean there was a lot of reviews I can't speak to it
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.960]  because I don't have a pixel 2 I'm getting the pixel 3 soon but there's you know a bunch of
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.880]  reviews like neil I and a few others all you know said like that the pixel 2 from last year was still
[43:29.880 --> 43:37.000]  a better still camera than the iPhone 10s so who knows how good the pixel 3 is yeah I haven't had
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.080]  a chance to test it but it seems to be great I mean the fact that they're even in the same
[43:41.080 --> 43:49.320]  sentence is astounding so that's you know whether it's 10% better or worse or you know even more
[43:49.320 --> 43:56.400]  than that that's pretty pretty remarkable considering much like Apple Google did not
[43:56.400 --> 44:01.440]  have much of a hardware or sorry did not have much of a a camera and smartphone background
[44:01.440 --> 44:07.280]  now before they just started so yeah there's a couple of features I wrote I wrote about it
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.000]  briefly on during fireball but there's a couple of features in the pixel 3 and and it's a little
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.000]  confusing what's what's pixel 3 specific and what is going to ship in a software update for existing
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.160]  pixel 1 and pixel 2 owners later this year there's a bunch of features they talked about at the event
[44:23.160 --> 44:28.400]  some of them are specific to the pixel 3 and some of them are coming to supposedly coming to older
[44:28.400 --> 44:37.400]  pixels later but almost like that who cares but the one feature that really blew me away is the
[44:37.400 --> 44:43.880]  one they're calling top shot which is like you you don't have to go to a special mode it's just
[44:43.880 --> 44:47.080]  I guess you can turn it off I don't see why you would though because it seems great you take a
[44:47.080 --> 44:54.120]  photo and it keeps a couple of frames from before you tap the shutter button and it takes a couple
[44:54.120 --> 45:01.560]  of extra frames after you hit the shutter button and it shoots a video in between as well so it
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.960]  might take let's say five stills at the full resolution with all of the everything you know
[45:07.960 --> 45:14.040]  they're all they get the same HDR processing everything you'd want and then in between those
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.240]  there's video and so the if you if you take one of the video frames you're going to get less
[45:18.240 --> 45:25.520]  resolution you know and it's not quite as good of a photo but the idea is like let's say you're
[45:25.520 --> 45:31.120]  shooting a sporting event or you know a whale is jump you're on a boat and whale jumps out of the
[45:31.120 --> 45:37.440]  water and you take a photo that the absolute best image that you get might be one of those video
[45:37.440 --> 45:43.920]  frames even though it's a slightly lower resolution image it might be the one you want to keep because
[45:43.920 --> 45:50.200]  it's the perfect moment right it's that perfect fraction of a sentence or second when the moment
[45:50.200 --> 45:56.640]  was just perfect but it in practice it really seems to work I again that this is something I
[45:56.640 --> 46:00.420]  don't have a pixel in hand yet but I only got to do it during the hands-on area but what they did
[46:00.420 --> 46:04.800]  is they gave us each a pixel to walk around with and while they were explaining the feature to me
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.080]  I took a picture of the the woman from Google product marketing who was telling me about it
[46:09.080 --> 46:14.120]  and I swear as I took the picture I actually caught her at a bad moment when she was looking
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.800]  down and her eyes were closed and as she's telling me about the top shot picture I took a picture of
[46:19.800 --> 46:24.320]  her it was a bad very unflattering photo because her eyes were closed and she's looking down and
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.280]  it immediately says would you prefer to use this one and it went back like half a second and she
[46:30.280 --> 46:36.760]  looked perfect and she's looking right at me it it's like I got I gave myself the perfect demo of
[46:36.760 --> 46:42.160]  the feature and so when you take a good photo and Google thinks it's a good photo it doesn't
[46:42.160 --> 46:47.480]  even ask you it like only is when it recognizes something like hey there's a subject here with
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.800]  her eyes closed we should that's to see if we can suggest something better and it happens
[46:52.800 --> 46:58.320]  instantaneously it happens right after you snap the shutter button that's cool you can do that
[46:58.320 --> 47:04.320]  manually with live photos right well and then scrub it a little right but right so it's the
[47:04.320 --> 47:09.400]  fact that this note this is like proactively recommending to you yeah that's cool yeah and
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.360]  it really does it again I shot like five you know five minutes where the photos but it really does
[47:15.360 --> 47:22.400]  seem to only suggest it to you when the photo really was taken at the wrong moment and doesn't
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.560]  bother you when you've taken a fine photo right away so it doesn't annoy you needlessly and it
[47:27.560 --> 47:35.600]  when it does interrupt it it's right that's pretty cool what was the other feature that I liked I
[47:35.600 --> 47:42.280]  love how both of these come both Google and Apple though are using software to make photos you know
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.800]  what 50 to 100 times better than just hardware alone would absolutely yeah it's and it's great
[47:47.800 --> 47:52.680]  that they're pushing each other you know and and there's you know I'm not saying that Google's
[47:52.680 --> 47:59.400]  ahead in every single regard but it's it's great though that somebody else is is doing similar
[47:59.400 --> 48:04.000]  type things and I know Samsung has some AI features to everybody's sort of doing it but it
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.280]  seems to me like Google and Apple are ahead ahead of everybody else here in different ways and who's
[48:08.280 --> 48:14.160]  not doing it are the camera companies like I almost never you know I still love the the photo
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.960]  that will come out from my Fuji more than you know it just feels like I'm taking a photo in a
[48:19.960 --> 48:27.200]  way that an iPhone photo still does not but when you when you do it side by side you know a lot of
[48:27.200 --> 48:33.680]  times the iPhone photo actually does look better yeah another cool feature they have I guess it's
[48:33.680 --> 48:41.080]  not a camera feature but it's the did you see the the call screening feature I did yeah that was
[48:41.080 --> 48:47.280]  cool that is really googly it's very googly and it really you know and they did again they they
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.880]  demoed it exactly the right way where there was like a Google employee up in a you know like in
[48:51.880 --> 49:02.560]  a different room who called us and we got a real phone call restaurant in you know because it was
[49:02.560 --> 49:08.280]  a real demo of a real feature and super useful and it's like they said I mean they even acknowledged
[49:08.280 --> 49:15.040]  you know that that you know the the spam phone calls are worse than ever you know I get them all
[49:15.040 --> 49:20.280]  the time so it would I would love to have that feature on iOS and it just makes so much sense
[49:20.280 --> 49:27.280]  that like it just takes you know that for all these years I mean going back before iPhone going
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.640]  back to like you know the original cell phones where they had a green button and a red button
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.360]  they've always been two buttons for when a phone call comes in take it or don't take it and now
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.120]  there's this third option where it's like okay phone you talk to this jerk see who it is right
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.760]  and if it turns out it's somebody you know if it's like you know your accountant is calling you or
[49:45.760 --> 49:50.600]  somebody you know is calling from a weird number you can see it on the transcript and then just
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.960]  jump right into the call and be like oh okay I didn't know who it was it's a very very cool
[49:56.960 --> 50:05.320]  feature and like you said very very googly what else so what do you have both phones as a review
[50:05.320 --> 50:12.960]  unit I do yeah I've only done the big one so I'm not taking out the I just I just picked them up
[50:12.960 --> 50:19.680]  today so I have not I will say I think it's a little I think it's a little weird and it is a
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.880]  little it they've gone the wrong way like one of my very very favorite things about the iPhone 10s
[50:24.880 --> 50:32.040]  is that the 10s and the 10s max are the only difference is the size that the cameras are
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.640]  exactly the same the CPU is exactly the same they have the same amount of RAM it's just you
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.560]  want a bigger one you know so the display is bigger and the battery is bigger because the
[50:40.560 --> 50:47.200]  you know because it's more room for a bigger battery but that's it they look the same you
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.920]  know and I just think anyway this is my way of saying I can't believe they put a big ugly notch
[50:50.920 --> 50:57.520]  on the one and not the other yeah and it doesn't seem to I maybe I'm not finding it but there does
[50:57.520 --> 51:03.600]  not seem to be the face ID type thing no they don't know there is no face ID type thing it's
[51:03.600 --> 51:09.400]  it's only there to have the two cameras because so the other weird thing I'm not weird but but
[51:09.400 --> 51:13.960]  certainly different from Apple I'll just say different is that they still only have one camera
[51:13.960 --> 51:20.040]  on the back as the main camera but now they have two cameras on the front one of which is like a
[51:20.040 --> 51:27.920]  normal focal length selfie camera and now they have this super wide angle almost fisheye selfie
[51:27.920 --> 51:37.440]  camera to get a wider field of view oh weird I can see my whole apartment in one right one right
[51:37.440 --> 51:41.760]  so you zoom it's like you you go to the selfie camera and then you can zoom the other way instead
[51:41.760 --> 51:47.440]  of like zooming in like a telephoto you zoom out and it's super wide in there it seems interesting
[51:47.440 --> 51:53.840]  I guess I don't know what I would use this all the time yeah someone who has an embarrassing
[51:53.840 --> 52:00.640]  number of selfies I would use this all the time that's cool all right but it looks I mean it
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.480]  actually looks kind of like a person looking back at you because there's two yeah it looks like a
[52:05.480 --> 52:12.160]  smiling creature of some sort but yeah I was surprised there's no face ID type thing no no
[52:12.160 --> 52:19.160]  it's now I'm now hooked on like this fingerprint thing like get rid of it yeah it's I don't know
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.760]  I know that there are all sorts of people out there who have mixed feelings about face ID
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.640]  versus touch ID and who are should not be holding their breath for it but are secretly hoping that
[52:29.640 --> 52:36.520]  Apple is working on touch ID under the glass like I'm telling you true I don't think it's gonna
[52:36.520 --> 52:42.800]  happen I don't think now and I actually think who knows I could be wrong that it maybe it would work
[52:42.800 --> 52:48.360]  well in addition to face ID but I sort of feel like there's an advantage to only having one
[52:48.360 --> 52:54.520]  biometric ID you know that you don't have to choose between fingerprint and face ID it's like
[52:54.520 --> 52:59.440]  if you've got the new phone you want to use face ID and if you have an older phone use touch ID I
[52:59.440 --> 53:05.320]  agree with you though they definitely lose style points for having the notch on one of them but
[53:05.320 --> 53:13.360]  not the other yeah 99.9 percent of people will never have both of them no at any point so and
[53:13.360 --> 53:22.200]  nor nor is this like iOS where they dictate how every phone looks like yeah you know the whole
[53:22.200 --> 53:28.120]  point of Android is that it works on you know a hundred thousand different phones so it's a
[53:28.120 --> 53:33.320]  weird-looking notch too though it is it's a it's the biggest notch I've ever seen it's a deep notch
[53:33.320 --> 53:42.040]  it's a deep notch and I know it's you know it's been amusing to watch like the the larger Android
[53:42.040 --> 53:49.040]  fan droid you know world of people are very down on this notch you know to their credit you know
[53:49.040 --> 53:53.160]  that they're being honest you know they're not just oh I love pixel phone so I'm gonna say this
[53:53.160 --> 53:59.480]  notch is the best notch no instead the consensus seems to be that this not this not just it is it's
[53:59.480 --> 54:05.920]  just you know what it's just ungainly yeah it's not bothering me at all well it is kind of weird
[54:05.920 --> 54:13.080]  but I don't know I fine I still don't like the notch on the iPhone 10 I I've you know I am used
[54:13.080 --> 54:18.640]  to it though I don't even I don't even see it anymore right but you know it just is weird that
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.520]  the two phones have different you know foreheads because the one has a regular forehead the other
[54:23.520 --> 54:32.760]  one are you are you back to the normal 10 size now yes I've I this is a weird thing is I know
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.400]  that when you put the 10s max next to like a previous plus phone like an iPhone 8 plus or
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.760]  7 plus whatever they're almost exactly the same size it's like less than I think it's like a
[54:44.760 --> 54:53.040]  millimeter the the iPhone 10s max is is like a millimeter smaller in each dimension or something
[54:53.040 --> 54:59.200]  like that it's very very similar but for some reason it looks and feels smaller in my hand
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.280]  than the plus size phones did I think it's just like an optical illusion created by the fact that
[55:04.280 --> 55:12.560]  that it has so much greater screen to body area ratio it somehow feels smaller so I never liked
[55:12.560 --> 55:19.800]  the plus size phones at all and never was tempted to buy a 6 plus or 7 plus or any of those even
[55:19.800 --> 55:23.120]  though it always bothered me that they had slightly better cameras you know with optical
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.600]  image stabilization and and a few features that the smaller one didn't have it just that the 10s
[55:28.600 --> 55:33.000]  max was actually somewhat tempting to me it was the first time the Apple made a larger phone that
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.080]  I was like hmm maybe and there were times when I was testing it when I forgot which one I had I
[55:38.080 --> 55:44.480]  was like wait is this the bigger one and a smaller one but I did end up buying the smaller one yeah
[55:44.480 --> 55:51.680]  I haven't I'm I'm still in the review unit stage I I was a plus guy for the three years or whatever
[55:51.680 --> 56:01.760]  it was during that era and now I'm testing out this max and boy that screen is gorgeous and the
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.840]  to me the most underappreciated thing about the bigger phones is that typing is much more accurate
[56:06.840 --> 56:13.920]  because the keys are wider yeah but I'm not really using the whole screen for anything like I still
[56:13.920 --> 56:19.880]  find myself reading in the top kind of third of the screen almost or top fourth of it and this
[56:19.880 --> 56:27.480]  thing just feels big in your pocket you know although having the new Apple watch series 4
[56:27.480 --> 56:33.040]  makes it kind of a different game because the and we can talk about the new watch for a bit I mean
[56:33.040 --> 56:39.800]  it's it is a really damn good device like it it feels like a computer on your wrist now in a way
[56:39.800 --> 56:46.560]  that it just did not previously and I would say that's 80% just speed like you it actually
[56:46.560 --> 56:54.080]  responds to your clicks and and doesn't get caught up in you know a series of commands but the
[56:54.080 --> 57:00.040]  software is starting to get really good too I mean especially the watch face like that well hold
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.760]  that though let's save it for a different section I got the feeling at the press thing and I feel
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.320]  like I'm clearly in the minority and I don't know like I and it's a sort of thing Apple doesn't like
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.960]  to talk about they'll give unit sales for iPhones but they don't like to break it down by model I
[57:14.960 --> 57:20.480]  would love to know what percentage of people are buying the regular tennis and what are buying who
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.800]  are buying the tennis max I really don't even know how to guess how that's going but at least among
[57:25.800 --> 57:33.000]  the enthusiast crowd like the sort of people who go to Google a Google press event to see the new
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.800]  phones the the bigger size is clearly the more popular it's like cuz oh and you know it's a
[57:40.800 --> 57:46.200]  funny thing because like you go to the Apple event and almost everybody's carrying an iPhone around
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.320]  like at the Google thing most of the press who I was there and looking around with we're carrying
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.680]  pixels you know because they're sort of Google you know it's it's gonna draw a Google oriented
[57:54.680 --> 58:00.040]  members of the media totally but it really looked to me just doing a quick eyeball survey that almost
[58:00.040 --> 58:07.480]  all of them had the pixel 2 plus or whatever they what do they call the big one plus XL XL yeah
[58:07.480 --> 58:13.640]  pixel 2 XL whereas I like the smaller one better for sure but it is weird it does look a little
[58:13.640 --> 58:18.320]  dated because it has a forehead and a chin I mean here I am knocking the notch on the other one but
[58:18.320 --> 58:25.120]  yeah and it seems it it's just one of those things that Apple Apple does better than anybody but you
[58:25.120 --> 58:32.200]  know and Google as sort of hardware being not their forte the fact that even the the one with
[58:32.200 --> 58:43.280]  the notch still has the chin down below at the bottom it just is it it's not a premium look yeah
[58:43.280 --> 58:52.080]  you wonder why they kept it you know whether they had to or they chose to yeah I don't know
[58:52.080 --> 59:00.440]  it does last year I think they had to I think that that it was it's technically super super
[59:00.440 --> 59:08.080]  hard to go edge to edge even though they're all led which makes it easier and not LCD but it
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.960]  everything I've heard from people at Apple is that getting these things you know doing getting the
[59:12.960 --> 59:17.880]  iPhone 10 and 10s to do it you know to get as close to corner to corner as they are is technically
[59:17.880 --> 59:24.640]  very hard and then that the 10 are which we can you know get to is even harder because it's an
[59:24.640 --> 59:32.160]  LCD screen not an OLED it just looks weird it just is sort of a weird look for the pixels in my
[59:32.160 --> 59:36.200]  opinion I also thought that they were a lot lighter I don't know what they what they weigh
[59:36.200 --> 59:42.520]  compared to a 10s but I don't mind how much the tennis ways but it is true I mean steel weighs
[59:42.520 --> 59:48.160]  more than aluminum so it's it is it is a heavier device I feel like the pixels really compare
[59:48.160 --> 59:54.960]  better to the 10 are because they're they're more just off the top of my head they're both glass on
[59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.460]  the front glass on the back aluminum on the sides and in a single camera on the back right so it's
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:05.040]  sort of the the 10 are is the one that you know and the starting price is around the same around
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.200]  seven hundred fifty eight hundred dollars it's like the tennis is sort of a different class
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:16.920]  device than even the best pixel it's true we're entering a 10 our world I need to recalibrate all
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:26.400]  my analysis now yeah I can't wait to find out more about it like the 10 are was is sort of it's like
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.280]  they announced it and it was interesting and you know it was kind of rumored and here it is and
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:37.240]  it's this you know it's just so strange in so many ways because it's like it's not the same size as
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.120]  the tennis or the tennis max it's in between it's one size and it's in between which is a weird
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.400]  third size and it only has one camera but it's the same great camera you know the that the tennis has
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.040]  and it comes in a bunch of fun colors which Apple hasn't done with an iPhone since all the way back
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:03.720]  at the 5c you know it's different in so many ways and I kind of feel and I just feel like most
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:09.720]  people feel like 800 bucks is already a ton of money to spend on a phone and so I just can't
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.160]  help but think that the 10r is going to be an incredible seller you know because it has the
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:22.840]  look and it has the performance of an iPhone 10 and you know saving 250 bucks for a you know
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:29.240]  primarily missing out on a 2x telephoto camera that I'm guessing a lot of people never use it's
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.120]  you know seems like it seems like a lot of people are gonna go into the Apple store and be like why
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.080]  would I even think about buying the more expensive one yeah that's gonna be really interesting
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:47.360]  because once you divide it into the monthly payments it's not as drastic a dollar difference
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:54.320]  but because now you know very few people are actually buying the phone outright but even on
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.560]  a monthly basis it's probably I don't know what 10 20 bucks cheaper a month so maybe yeah and I
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.720]  just don't think typical people are going to see the difference I mean I not like they wouldn't be
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.760]  able to tell them apart I mean certainly the colors tell you that you know but I really don't
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.040]  think that a typical person would look at an iPhone 10s and 10r side by side and think that
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:24.360]  the 10s is that much better you know especially inside if you're if you're outside I you know now
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.120]  I know I would never want to not have well I don't know I haven't tried the 10r outside maybe it's
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:39.720]  amazing but that you you can tell OLED outside in a way that yeah LCD just was not as good before
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.080]  yeah and you know I mean it's you see it when you play games and watch movies or something like that
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.520]  too where OLED has these richer blacks but I to tell you the truth I don't really watch movies on
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.000]  my phone I mean that's I either watch on TV or if I am on an airplane or something I want a bigger
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.360]  screen than the phone so you know I kind of miss out on that do you think this new what is it liquid
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.160]  retina do you think that's what they're gonna call the iPad Pro I wonder that's a good that's a good
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:14.280]  question I guess I would guess so I wouldn't be surprised if it's the exact same technology I do
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.360]  have another theory by the way because the other feature that's missing from the 10r is 3d touch
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:25.680]  and it has been widely reported ever you know and this was one of those things that Ming Chi Kuo had
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.640]  you know leaked a report back in February or something so it's a long time ago it came out
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:38.400]  that Apple's 6.1 inch mystery phone was going to lack 3d touch and it's all been reported as like
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.800]  a cost saving measure because this is the lower cost new iPhone but it's not really a lower cost
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:50.440]  new iPhone it starts at $800 or 750 bucks like that that's the normal price for a new flagship
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:58.960]  iPhone like that the 10s and the iPhone 10 it's created a new super tier above the normal price
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.600]  and you know like when they first introduced I just looked it up last night for the show
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:10.600]  actually but the I 3d touch debuted with the iPhone 6s and that was a phone that started at
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.520]  like $699 that was the entry level price back then for the success and they all had 3d touch
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:25.120]  so it's not cost per se you know if a $699 phone four years ago could have 3d touch then cost wise
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:33.780]  surely the $750 10r could have 3d touch I think it's a technical problem that that whatever
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:40.300]  shenanigans and and technical wizardry they had to pull to get an LCD screen that comes as close
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:45.200]  to corner to corner as they did I mean the whole reason that LCDs have always had foreheads and
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:53.360]  chin is is for the backlighting stuff I think that whatever they had to do to get the they
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.280]  they sacrifice 3d touch to get it to look like an iPhone 10 that goes corner to corner and I'm
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.760]  betting that it's an engineering problem not a cost problem and if it saves seven bucks per phone
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.960]  I'm sure that makes typical happy too but it is weird for the product experience though that that
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.200]  they work in different ways for stuff like turning on the flashlight and stuff like that yeah that
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.600]  was one of the things I just noticed on this pixel too is not I'm not having because you know I
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:28.460]  basically only use it for cursor movement yeah in the cursor but that alone to me pays for the
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:33.980]  feature so not having it all right this might blow your mind though this might blow your mind did you
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:39.000]  know I think it's an iOS 12 feature I don't think it was there in iOS 11 but Apple has added and I
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.640]  think it was specifically with iPads and the 10 are in mind you can now get that cursor move around
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.240]  feature on a non 3d touch iOS device by holding down on the spacebar hold down on the spacebar
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:59.240]  for a little bit and then you get the same thing okay so you can buy a 10 are and you still you
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:05.440]  don't miss out on the you know and oh yeah look at that Wow and for those of you listening who
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.640]  don't know what I'm talking about it because I one time a couple episodes like six months ago I
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.000]  mentioned this and I got so much email from people saying oh holy shit that's the greatest tip ever
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  I didn't I had no idea is that on a on a modern iPhone with 3d touch when you're typing this
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.280]  actually gets to the point we were talking about earlier with the trackpad support where you can
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.680]  3d touch anywhere on the keyboard and it turns the keyboard into a trackpad where you can move
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.760]  the insertion point around whatever you texted is you're editing and if you touch again while
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:42.360]  you're moving it it'll select text it's it's it once you know to do it it is a truly I I know
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.720]  it's a cliche but it's a game-changing feature you can do it now on non 3d touch iOS devices
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:54.800]  by holding down on the spacebar for a fraction of a second and it's a fantastic feature well
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.000]  there you go we've just paid for the before we go I wanted there's here's the other feature I wanted
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.880]  to mention with the pixel cameras and it seems very cool it's called motion autofocus so you
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.560]  compose your shot and you tap and hold on like the subject let's say it's a dog or somebody's
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:17.000]  up somebody at Google actually went to a concert the night before and and shot it was a great
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.800]  little video or really cool but you can like tap on a on the subject and then once you tap on it
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:30.400]  if the subject moves around the the focus stays on that person as they move around using you know
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.800]  artificial intelligence to identify what it is so it for a moving subject it's absolutely it seems
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.360]  absolutely amazing and once you see it you think oh my god every camera should have this and again
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.640]  like you said where it's Google and Apple who are inventing these things and the camera companies
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:54.400]  seem to be just leaving leaving leaving all this stuff on the table yeah this is exactly what I
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:01.040]  need on my Fuji so right cool all right great Fuji is probably the closest in my opinion I'm
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.280]  not really I can't say I'm a camera expert but I think Fuji of the major camera companies is
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:11.280]  the company that seems to me to be most taking seriously the world of computational photography
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.960]  maybe I'm biased because I have a Fuji x100 s which is now a couple years old I'm sure the
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:26.440]  newest ones do even more but it just seems to me like Fuji is doing more more more confidently
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.200]  moving towards the world of computational photography and whereas like Canon and Nikon
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:38.000]  to me still seem to be treating digital sensors as like it's like a 35 millimeter strip of film
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.360]  I have I I guess I'm looking in the wrong spots then I need to I need to do some more research on
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:55.160]  that because it you know I I buy Fuji for the glass and for the you know for the look and feel
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:00.240]  of the camera and also the amazing image quality I have not noticed much of the computational
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.280]  well I think but I will have to do some reading on it now I think compared to compared to Google
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.320]  and Apple they're still light years behind yeah I know it's just the the motion this motion focus
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.000]  tracking is just mind-blowing but once you see it amazing it it's very cool you could do it you
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.120]  don't even have to be a person like like somebody at the hands-on area last week just did it like
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.560]  showed their watch and then it like moved their hand around the frame and as they move the hand
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.880]  around the frame the little white square stays on the watch it's really cool I mean and the best
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.160]  part of all this it just seems intuitive like this is how photography should work you know ignoring
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:41.000]  all of the technical constraints of the actual process of using sensors to take a digital image
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  like you know even the simplest thing of being able to zoom by pinching on the viewfinder screen
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.080]  on an iPhone like yeah duh of course that's how a photo feature should work so what else is Google
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.920]  doing there they had a cool feature I don't know how well this works I mean because they
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.800]  obviously knew they had like a pair of Nikes and you point I think it's a different mode you put
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.720]  the camera in but you put it like an ID mode show it show the Nikes and then it immediately says oh
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.800]  these are the Nike Air Max whatever whatever I have to you know I'm in back Oh panzerino doesn't
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:20.400]  listen to this but you know whatever model of Nike this is you know it tells you exactly what model
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.640]  it is and gives you options for where you could go buy them right now and stuff like that I how
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.240]  widely that works with you know all brands of shoes and shirts and whatever else you might
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.680]  identify it who knows but apparently it works great with like movie posters so you pointed at
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.200]  a movie poster and tells you everything you want to know about that movie it's it's a pretty cool
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.040]  feature all right let me take another break here thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:51.600]  at Squarespace look Squarespace makes building a new website as easy as it can possibly be I
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.600]  honestly can't even fathom how you could get a custom-made custom design website that you have
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:03.440]  complete control over in a way that is like less busy work less fiddling less tedium than
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.200]  Squarespace and it really is soup to nuts everything from registering domain names
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.240]  picking templates adjusting the look and feel actually being a CMS so like if you're one of
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.560]  the features on your site is a blog or if you want to host a podcast on your Squarespace site
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.240]  you enter you know you actually you know the the CMS for making a new episode or making a new blog
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:31.960]  post all of that is right there in Squarespace all of it is right there it really is just a
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.680]  fantastic service they've been sponsoring this podcast for as long as I can remember and people
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:42.480]  keep signing up and that's why they keep coming back as a sponsor but it really is great I say
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.120]  it all the time that the next time you have to make a website or even more importantly if somebody
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.080]  your friend or family somebody comes to you and they don't know jack about making websites and
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:56.240]  they know you do and they come to you for help get them started on Squarespace and it'll get them
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.080]  out of your hair it and it'll be everybody will be happier you'll be happier because you're not
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.600]  building a website for them as a favor they'll be happier because they're gonna get a terrific
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.440]  website and they're gonna have control over it and if they need help they can get help from
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.040]  Squarespace they don't have to go to you it really is a fantastic service and it just you just cannot
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.480]  believe if you ever start doing view source on various websites you just wouldn't believe how
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:24.320]  many websites on a daily basis you use that are Squarespace sites every time you see like a new
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.280]  website from like a cool new restaurant or something like that if you do view source I'll
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.720]  bet it's a Squarespace site because you know what like if you're opening a website you know what you
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.000]  don't want to do you don't want to screw around and waste weeks building a website and you don't
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.800]  want to spend a fortune hiring somebody for tens of thousands of dollars to build one you just want
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.960]  to get your brand out there get your menu up tell people where the hours are you could do it yourself
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:53.040]  on Squarespace it really is super easy for non technical users non designers even to build a
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:00.560]  really great looking website that works great super fast everything you'd want you know responsive

[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:52.720]  show kind of want to start bribing and or forcing all restaurants to just move over to Squarespace
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:59.840]  I did when they do when there is a bad website for a restaurant I think the exact same thing I
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:09.320]  it's like half an hour out of my day just to find the menu or the reservation link or whatever well
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.560]  hash still it's I feel like restaurants are always had they were always flash that I would
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.920]  say there was no industry in the world that was more likely to have a flash player website than
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.320]  restaurants I feel like they've gotten their act together in recent years I feel especially new
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.400]  places at least here in Philly it seems like a lot of new places have pretty good websites
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.920]  well it's because if you view source they're pretty much all Squarespace now there's there
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.080]  are a couple other tools that exist but they're not as good no and you know and I also feel like
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.880]  webs websites for it was like you could just do like a talk at like a web design conference about
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.160]  how bad web websites for restaurants where people want the exact same thing for every time they go
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.400]  to to to a website for a restaurant they want like three things they want to see the menu they want
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:03.080]  to know the hours and they want to know how do you make a reservation you know it's that and usually
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.840]  now it's open table but just give put them put a big button there so they can tap it and shoot
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.200]  them right over to open table to make the reservation but that's all people want and
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.840]  websites used to hide all of those all of those things like how could you have a restaurant and
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.520]  not put the menu up that's what people want to know is there something here to eat that looks
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:28.800]  good to me yeah nuts all right the home hub that's the last thing from Google that I didn't talk
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.720]  about it's it's like a little you know they've got a whole bunch of these you know the their
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:40.080]  little speaker type things and this one has a screen I can't think of these things with this
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.080]  screen speakers Amazon has one you know we well I don't need to get into detail about Facebook's
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.920]  but one of the things they mentioned very very prominently was that they deliberately did not
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:56.520]  put a camera in this device and I thought that's pretty interesting coming from Google you know
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.640]  who you know you could see Apple bragging about making a thing without a camera for privacy sake
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:10.760]  but I thought it was pretty interesting that Google did I don't know about these things with
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:18.880]  the screen I guess I kind of get it I think that the home hub though is it is too small is my
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.240]  that's my take because it's sort of like this I don't know what the diagonal measurement on
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.920]  the screen is but it's sort of like either a very very small tablet even smaller than an iPad mini
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.800]  or like the world's biggest phone like the biggest phablet ever made but if you're gonna have it in
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.440]  your kitchen and it has a screen I feel like people want to use that as a TV at some point
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.800]  they want to watch video and you know they own YouTube and they definitely mentioned YouTube in
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.800]  terms of like hey you know you can talk to the thing and get it to show YouTube videos but I
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.960]  feel like it's too small of a screen in a kitchen to be that I feel like you want something more
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:03.800]  like the size of a regular iPad as a minimum and then the other area where they showed it off was
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:10.840]  like as a bedside table dingus and I don't feel like that makes any sense at all because everybody
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.680]  charges their phone next to their bed so they don't need a device that size and in fact Google
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.800]  even came out with their own little Qi charging pad stand that stands your iPhone up so it can
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:30.000]  serve as a bedside clock slash picture viewer so I I don't I don't get the home hub I get the idea
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  of having a screen on these talking devices but I feel like if you're gonna have a screen you want
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.320]  it to be at least like 10 inches at least for use in a kitchen I just feel like this one is too
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:47.480]  small yeah yeah that's a good point I've watched many 90s Cubs games on a 4-inch tube TV in my
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.800]  kitchen but yeah that's that you don't have to do that anymore I I watch I watch my iPad a lot
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.040]  when I do watch video it's often in the kitchen because we only we only have one TV and so I'll
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.360]  often watch baseball games on the iPad and I just can't imagine doing it on a smaller screen than a
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:13.440]  9.7 inch iPad like it's nice for me and it's it's certainly at 9.7 inches it isn't something that
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:19.240]  you would be it wouldn't be great for a communal viewing right like it's sort of personal it's like
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.960]  the nice like a nice size for you to watch one thing you wouldn't really want to have like a
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.000]  group of four people staring at an iPad but yeah and it's ambient like especially these kitchen
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.800]  things I'm kind of interested in these I don't own any of them but like in the Facebook one is
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:40.840]  you know its own kind of can of worms but which does have camera that will track you around if
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:47.960]  you want to do video conferencing on it I think the idea of having kind of a purpose-built device
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:53.440]  that's just on in the kitchen you don't have to go find the iPad you don't have to you don't have
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.720]  to you know you don't maybe don't have your phone with you I think it's interesting especially for
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:06.640]  kind of ambient TV like a like a sports game where you're gonna ignore 75% of it but then maybe you
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:14.560]  know lean over and watch that bad or the you know the field goal but for looking at recipes or
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:20.760]  playing playing music or whatever it's it's an interesting genre to me I I don't I haven't spent
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.120]  my own money on any of them I don't I don't know if I will to me it's like okay I have an old iPad
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:34.440]  that does a lot of that already but I can see why Amazon and Google and Facebook are are making them
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:39.280]  it's certainly you know and they don't have to be the thinnest thing imaginable they don't have to
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.640]  in many cases they're plugged into the wall so they don't even have to have a good battery life
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:51.000]  so it's kind of interesting it you know it kind of serves the purpose that the home PC may have
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.920]  once had like the living room yeah computer where the family can each check their email or or do
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.520]  thing you're not gonna do your homework on it but right now and the interface is interesting
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.680]  exactly along the lines you're talking where instead of being I don't even know what OS
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.560]  it's running I don't know if it's running if if it's Android under the hood I guess I should
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.400]  have asked that's a question I guess I could have asked I I guess it might be Android but it it's
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.960]  not Android like it's not like a phone you know there's no home button and a screen full of apps
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:28.760]  and text that is meant to be held 18 inches from your eyes everything on it is is big you know the
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:37.560]  text is big and it's it's you know in a way even an iPad is still sort of it can't it can't do
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.120]  everything it can't be you know you can't have an interface that works both 18 inches in front of
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:50.000]  your face and five feet away right right and and so for things like cooking instructions and stuff
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.720]  like that the text is comically large compared to a phone but it actually seems exactly right
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.800]  for something that might be well over an arm's reach away while you're making whatever it is
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.520]  you're making I just feel like it should be it should be bigger I think I don't know though I
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:13.840]  just don't know if like this is the device that people all of a sudden decide they they love and
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:20.400]  need but I probably would have said that about the first echo devices too and the smart speakers
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:30.360]  and right here we are and everyone has one now so and I use mine every day yeah I you know that's
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:39.160]  funny I digression I guess but we have like smart shades ooh who I need those oh it's they're great
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:47.320]  yeah from Lutron and they're super quiet and for a long time we did you know we have buttons that
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.080]  you know little remotes that control them and they're okay but it's it's really better when
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.320]  when you issue voice commands and you can raise all of them like on our main living floor all at
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:04.360]  once but we had it for a long time where we had the only the only integration that that that are
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:13.440]  supported was Amazon so we had to do it through the echo and you had to give these exact commands
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.880]  like so to open the kitchen shades it was hey dingus turn on kitchen shades up so the name of
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:27.600]  the scene was kitchen shades up and to make it happen you had to say turn on so grammatically
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:33.040]  that's a mess turn on kitchen shades up and then turn on kitchen shades down and and there was
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.840]  also this weird rule and again I'm not blaming Amazon it might have been Lutron who whose fault
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:45.840]  it was and maybe with other things it would be better with Amazon but not only that but you in
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:55.520]  your scene names you couldn't use the words on and off and it's just it's it was and it's so
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:01.040]  much time so we got it we got it we got like the base station for the Lutron thing it's just looks
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:08.440]  like a little like Wi-Fi router but we got that swapped out with one that's homekit compatible
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:15.360]  and I like doing this stuff through Siri so much better and I know that you know all sorts of
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.760]  people think Siri's garbage and the Lexus so much better but you can in the home app you can like
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:27.080]  it's so much easier to a it's way easier to program like and to adjust it and you can give
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.680]  it whatever name and it's like with the Amazon thing I could never I honest to God couldn't
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:35.480]  figure it out it was like it's like once we had it set up that was it but I didn't had to change
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:41.760]  it but it still is sort of confusing and and Siri lets you speak to it so much more naturally you
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.320]  can just you know name it name something kitchen kitchen shade open the kitchen shades and just
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:54.440]  say you know hey dingus open the kitchen shades and and you can say all sorts of things like just
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:59.800]  you know open up the shades in the kitchen and it'll it'll do it it doesn't have to be the exact
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:06.440]  right command line style incantation like it understands natural language but it was funny
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:12.040]  I was confused and thought it was broken because I programmed it so that our our both our living
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.880]  room and our kitchen are on the same floor and I made a scene called open all shades and close all
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.360]  shades and then I would say hey dingus open all shades and sometimes it would work and open them
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.560]  all and then other times it would open every shade in the house including like our bedrooms
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.920]  and it was because I named it was like I gave it a bad scene name because sometimes Siri would
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.560]  interpret it as this is the exact name of a scene you defined I'll do it and other times it was like
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.160]  I'll open every shade I know about because you said open all the shades yeah which is actually
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.640]  it was almost like it was too clever so I changed the name of the scene to like main floor shade
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.680]  open main floor shades and close main floor shades and now there's no more confusing but I have to
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.720]  say that editing that stuff in the home app in iOS is so much nicer to me way nicer and way more
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:05.400]  sensible and very visual in terms of oh I see here's it just here's the icons for all the shades
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.880]  that'll go up when I turn this scene on it's super super visual and really nice and I almost feel
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.080]  like Apple doesn't get enough credit for how nice that is yeah especially now that you know and I
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:23.900]  haven't actually spent much time in the Siri whatever the automator thing is called the
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:30.400]  workflows yeah shortcuts shortcuts yeah but being able to stitch all those things together makes
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.040]  really makes homekit compelling if you already have all the devices yeah it's a big if but once
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:41.720]  you do it's really really pretty sweet yeah but even just like the home app being able to toggle
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:49.000]  that stuff without saying anything to is can be useful yeah totally absolutely and it would you
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.120]  know just open it up do you hit a button there goes yeah you know much like live photos I can
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.440]  imagine homekit being one of those things that just becomes quietly more and more popular and
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.600]  useful and yeah the kind of thing that you know I only have one I have one smart light bulb so
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.920]  that doesn't do anything but when we move we'll probably have a bunch of stuff so yeah and I have
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.560]  to say it was really pretty cool too because I at some point when we first bought these shades we
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.360]  had to set up this lutron app and we got an account with lutron and it's I've but I haven't
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.080]  opened that lutron app and like over a year I in fact I'll bet that on my iPhone 10s I'm not even
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.600]  logged in because I don't think I've I haven't opened it since I got a new phone but once you've
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.480]  got it configured when you open the iOS home app it already knows about all these things because
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.960]  the lutron app like uses the API's to say okay I'll report to homekit here's everything I know
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:50.240]  about and so you open the Apple home app and all of the stuff that it can control it's all just
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.840]  there like you don't have to like add devices to home it once you've configured them in whatever
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.560]  the app is for the thing it's really really pretty nice and I feel like exactly what you said that
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.200]  it's sort of everybody was like ah you know and there was that whole thing when homekit was first
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:15.120]  announced where because they had sort of a lot tighter review process and security concerns you
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.080]  know that there were you know hundreds and hundreds of things that you could control through
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.320]  the Amazon you know devices and there were a lot fewer for home homekit because Apple had these
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:30.720]  more stringent things but I feel like quietly they've you know gotten a lot of these things
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.800]  into the system I don't know it's something that if anybody blew it off years ago it's worth
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:44.360]  another look if you haven't looked at it recently is what I'm trying to say what else do we got
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:50.000]  here we get we didn't talk about we were saving it we're saving the the Apple watch series 4 yeah
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.880]  why don't we yeah let's do let's talk about it I it's like you said or did you we can we can fit
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:02.960]  it in with the the new palm the new palm phone that came out oh my the which is basically an
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.880]  Apple watch with no band on it right right I linked to it on during fireball I guess I'll put
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:16.600]  it in the show notes Dieter bone of course who's the the palm guy the palm guy love it it's a it's
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:23.600]  so weird that somebody bought the name palm and put this on this because it there's nothing palm
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:30.480]  like about it it just says palm but it's not web OS it's Android it's mostly stock Android it's a
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:37.560]  little phone that Verizon is selling very heavily it Verizon I guess is a big part of it I don't
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.280]  think it's even on any other carriers it even has a little Verizon thing on the glass on the front
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:48.600]  sort of subtle down at the bottom which in itself is like as Dieter points out is kind of messed up
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:57.800]  because Verizon arguably like sunk the the palm by not selling the right or whatever right when when
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:05.440]  palm was was worth saving and and really was making very interesting products that just
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:13.360]  couldn't get traction for some reason her eyes and definitely helps sink them and now they're
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:19.680]  selling a device back with Steph Curry yeah so it has a 3.3 inch screen which is actually smaller
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.200]  than even the original iPhone the original iPhone is 3.5 it's a tiny little phone it obviously has
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.840]  smaller bezels than an old iPhone 2 so it's it's not quite corner-to-corner but it's pretty small
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:36.560]  it's you know certainly one of the smallest touchscreen phones I've ever seen and it looks
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.800]  adorable but to me that the thing that is just like what are they thinking is that it's designed
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:49.000]  as a secondary phone but that you know in the same way that with a cellular Apple watch you
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.480]  pay 10 bucks a month to Verizon so that you can have this second phone it that technically has
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:01.200]  its own SIM card and phone number but instead because it's paired with your main device you're
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.400]  you know if you put your main phone away and you go out with your little new palm phone and somebody
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.320]  calls your regular number the palm phone will ring and you'll talk to it on there and you'll
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:16.440]  get your text messages there etc it's like an alias to your yeah your phone as opposed to a
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:22.600]  second phone right but what it's like I to me having the cellular Apple watch is pretty cool
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:32.840]  in that regard and especially now with the new watch OS I and now that third-party apps like
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:41.400]  overcast can can actually do podcasts from the watch it's when I go jogging now I don't have to
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:46.440]  put my phone in a ridiculous fanny pack underneath my shirt I can I can literally just leave the
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:53.160]  house with just my watch and AirPods and I it's such a great AirPod feature the way that if the
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.280]  AirPods are paired with my phone but I leave the house without them with my watch they just
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:02.560]  automatically go to the watch and like okay I'll just play the audio from the watch and you don't
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:08.440]  have to fiddle around with anything just works and I go to overcast play a podcast and I'm listening
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:13.320]  to it it's fantastic and I know that if somebody calls me I'll get I'll get the phone call it's
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:19.400]  it's it's really a great feature but I can't see I can't I having it on a watch having your watch
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:25.040]  be a secondary phone is seems like a great feature and I really do like it it's definitely worth
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:32.760]  ten bucks a month to me having a second phone not so much like it just doesn't make any sense to me
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:40.080]  I wish that they had just made a phone at this really tiny adorable size and made it good enough
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:47.080]  that it could be your main phone that it has a great camera and in you know that to me would be
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.520]  more of a statement in terms of hey how about we focus less on these five and a half inch screens
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:57.920]  that absorb so much of our attention every day how about you take a tiny little 3.3 inch phone
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.760]  and spend less time on it that would be more interesting to me this this idea of a secondary
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:09.720]  phone it goes back to that Dave Moran from what was it path with his day yeah day phone and night
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:20.760]  phone anyway yep no I I have I mean I have no interest in this at all I found there's another
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:28.160]  company that it's called punked or punked that makes like you know Android powered essentially
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:34.000]  like candy bar phones like all these things that that are trying to to like force you off of your
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:42.200]  phone either for convenience or for you know time well spent quote-unquote the idea that people are
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:47.160]  gonna spend another $350 for that just doesn't make any sense to me like it's does not seem
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.880]  like you know I don't know the watch I guess that's how much my problem I think my new watch
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:33:02.680]  actually costs like $500 but so here I am a huge hypocrite but that again to me has has different
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:08.520]  utility like it's it's a purpose-built device as opposed to having just a second smaller phone that
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:14.960]  doesn't have I guess if you're on Android maybe it's like if you're on an iPhone I don't know how
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.840]  you what just switch over to Android at nighttime or something I guess it's clearly meant for people
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.520]  who have an Android phone it's not yeah it doesn't it won't do I message either so oh yeah true right
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.560]  yeah that's why I was scared to put my SIM card into this pixel 3 I don't I don't want to mess up
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.800]  my I message I forget how that works now that's why I have us I have a I bought a second yeah years
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.840]  ago but I'm gonna get a second SIM card for that yeah I got it a t-mobile and it's great it's I
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.640]  forget what I pay per month but it's it really is like no-nonsense it's like 40 bucks a month or
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.880]  something like that and it's like no fit the bill really is like 40 bucks a month it's not like I
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.600]  don't want to try the project fi oh that's another Google thing yeah especially if you're gonna pop
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.800]  it be popping it into Android phones it's probably I just don't know how easy that is to start and
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:07.960]  stop yeah I don't really want to keep paying for it yeah after the t-mobile one is great because
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:13.600]  it's prepaid and you can sign up to automatically renew every month but if I ever do but if I ever
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:20.440]  do want to cancel I you know I I would just go to their website say I want to cancel and and then
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:25.160]  at the end of the month my SIM card will just stop working so there's no no contract no funny
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.080]  business it's it's really a great way you know if you're gonna get a it just seems so much easier
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:36.560]  than getting a sim like a secondary quote-unquote SIM card from like the the AT&T or Verizon yeah
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:45.640]  totally hmm yeah anyway so the the watch yeah so the palm I don't I don't really have much to say
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:51.360]  about the palm other than that as someone who loved loved loved palm for I don't know what
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:59.560]  15 years like sad to see this this era but right this too will pass I guess I don't know yeah it's
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:07.000]  it's it's a it's such a it's the saddest story in the entire it I'm gonna to me the iPhone marks the
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.120]  beginning of like a new era of personal computing and it's very it just seems so clear in hindsight
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:18.080]  that there's pre iPhone and post iPhone and that is just it it's every bit as big a deal as like
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:25.840]  the Mac was for for computing and in the post iPhone world to me the greatest tragedy is the
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:30.040]  palm didn't make it because they were doing such interesting stuff with their user interface I mean
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:36.600]  indeed Dieter never misses an opportunity that's right to point out how many of the things that the
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:42.400]  new features of like the iPhone 10 with the swipe up from bottom to go to a card view of running
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:50.360]  apps and all sorts of things that palms web OS was doing in like 2008 2009 it was they deserve
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:57.040]  so many kudos and it was a super attractive OS it looked great it was really really well done and
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.840]  I know there were a bunch of ex-apple people at palm and it I always said like the the palm pre
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:12.360]  you could easily have gone back if you took like a 2008 palm pre and went back 10 years to like
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:18.320]  1997 in time and said showed it to people and said this is you know cover up the logos and said this
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.360]  is Apple's cell phone from ten years ago everybody would say oh yeah definitely oh my god that's
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.760]  amazing I can't wait to get it and you could totally sell it as the Apple phone from ten
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:33.040]  years in the future just in terms of the system design and what it looked like it just was so
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:40.640]  copacetic corners yep curved corners it just you know if you like Apple stuff it was hard not to
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:49.400]  like the palm stuff and if anything it was almost more of a classic pre Steve Jobs Apple look and
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.400]  feel than the post Steve Jobs look and feel there was you know it was almost more like the classic
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:01.680]  Apple which I loved and and in many ways you know it you know I was just looking somebody actually
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:09.560]  reported a typo under over the weekend somebody reported a typo from October 11th 2002 on daring
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:17.320]  fireball excellent I so I said about I was just I missed the word a just like this I I don't it
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.320]  was like this this should it should have said like this is a big deal and it just said this is big
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.520]  deal or something like that so I fixed it and and you know said to them you know you've just broken
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.680]  the record for oldest typo ever because I only started the site in August 2002 so it was like
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:41.320]  10 weeks 10 weeks into during fireball and I just fixed it now but I remember I just and then it
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.160]  sucked me into like reading old 2002 during fireball articles and like a big theme back
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:53.040]  then was all the various ways that Mac OS X was crummy compared to Mac OS 9 and and to me the
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:38:05.400]  Palm Pre sort of nice that Mac OS 9 niceness in terms of no no weird fiddly things I don't know
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:11.600]  it's a sad story and now there's me I think eight five for me was the the Pentagon closest to my
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.080]  heart but no yeah probably for me too could have just been the point of my life that I was at I
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:24.520]  don't know I don't I also have a soft spot for system 7.5 I thought so yeah I was it was a
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:32.280]  really sweet one although it's it was the current version for so long that maybe maybe it was it
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:41.920]  was like Stockholm syndrome 7.5 that's like true 7.5 was the classic Mac OS that was like at the
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:48.400]  time when Apple was flailing with these eventually all these efforts for quote unquote next generation
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.240]  OS is that never never really even came close to seeing the light of day and so therefore it just
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:39:01.160]  just sort of sat around as the current version of Mac OS for a long time but that's neither here nor
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:10.160]  there Apple watch series for well so to me the most interesting thing I've seen well so and you
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:18.480]  you posted the good links to the 9 to 5 Mac story on making the infograph face yes more more useful
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.080]  and I've got a couple of those utility apps that I had never heard of before which is kind of cool
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.360]  but to me the most exciting thing are it's just this idea of the of the UI playground that is the
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:40.480]  Apple watch face now that there's enough space to poke around and you know this Steve wasn't Steve
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.240]  trout and Smith is that his name yeah so I'll put a link to this in the show notes I think I've got
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.160]  here already yeah but Steve trout and Smith who is hacker extraordinaire he's one of the you know
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.520]  you know his name he's one of the guys who you know sometimes finds finds things in beta OS
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.680]  releases of iOS that reveal upcoming hardware products and stuff like that he's also a very
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.880]  very talented programmer but he's been on a kick since if anybody is by the time you listen to this
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:14.920]  it'll be maybe closer to a week but for the last maybe half a week or so he's been a recurring
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.960]  theme with Apple watch is how come they don't allow third-party watch faces there's apps and
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:26.720]  then you can your app can provide complications that fit in these you know predefined okay there's
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:33.320]  a corner complication you know monochrome you know for the certain watch face and then there's a
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:39.400]  corner complication on the utility face that is color and you provide you know you get to use
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.680]  these API's to make a complication for your app that provides data that fits in these little
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.520]  complication areas that are predefined by Apple but you don't get nobody's allowed nobody but
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.800]  Apple is allowed to make watch faces and you know that's been a source of controversy or debate ever
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.560]  since the Apple watch shipped is what is Apple thinking in this regard are they is it something
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.160]  they haven't gotten around to yet is it something they're on the fence over or are they like hell
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:11.840]  no we're never gonna let people make watch faces and if so why not but so rather than just talk
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.480]  about it Stephen trout and Smith just started making them and it's not even like a hack it's
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.000]  not really a watch face what he's done is he's making apps and then he turned on the setting in
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.440]  the Apple watch I think you have I don't know if you can do it on the watch itself or if you have
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:33.600]  to use the phone app but there's a setting for last used app and it's like I think by default
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.120]  it'll you know like when you raise your wrist does it show you your watch face or does it show you
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.640]  the last app you were using and I think by default it's like after two minutes it goes back to your
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:49.280]  watch face so like if you're using you know a weather app or something like that on your wrist
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.800]  and you tap around you don't have to like quit it or go back to home you can just lower your
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.880]  wrist and go about your day and five minutes later when you go to check the time it just
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.920]  goes back to your watch face but what he's done is set it so that it always goes back to your last
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:09.880]  running what our app and he's made these apps that look like watch faces and so every time he raises
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:18.320]  his wrist it just shows his custom app that shows a watch face and he's literally I you're gonna
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:24.600]  think I'm making this up but he's he's made like a system where he can generate he's got like a
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:32.880]  bunch of options for like color schemes and and dial schemes and he's generated like 65,000 of
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.880]  these things algorithmically like by randomizing the colors and the options and most of them look
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:44.440]  really cool it is amazing it is super cool it I'll put a link in and if you haven't looked at these
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.240]  things it is really really cool he's got this one of the options he has is something that sort of
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:55.480]  emulates the very clever I've never seen anything like it just because it could only happen on a
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:03.800]  digital face but the Hermes watch faces for series four have an option where the half the screen is
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:09.240]  one color and the other half is the other color and the dividing line between them is based on
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:16.480]  the minute hand of the watch so as time changes the color scheme slowly changes over the course
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:24.240]  of 60 minutes so he's replicated that and has literally started yeah he was just trying to clone
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:30.560]  that maybe I don't know yeah but it's he's it's really awesome I love it yeah and the other thing
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  he's doing it they do look plausible because the one thing about Apple watch faces branding wise
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:43.600]  and we're talking about analog style ones ones with an hour hand and a minute hand the one thing
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:51.080]  all Apple watch faces to date share in common is they use the exact same style of hands which I've
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.240]  actually I've actually asked around when I was on the hood in keypad podcast a couple weeks ago
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:59.440]  talking about Apple watch and I actually asked because those guys know more about watches than
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.600]  anybody I asked if there was a name for this style of hand like there's all sorts of watch
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.640]  lingo for like different style of hands like there's some that are called like fence post
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.480]  hands because they're like straight and then they have like a triangle at the end think about like
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:19.400]  a like a traditional Americana fence you know a picket fence there's sword hands like certain
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:24.080]  kind of hands that look sort of like a like a sword but this style of hands doesn't really
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.960]  have a name it's used a couple of high-end watchmakers use hands like this but everybody
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.520]  knows that look it's sort of like a capsule with a little skinny thing at the end to connect it to
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.920]  the center you know like an oval these oval shaped hands he's Stephen trout and Smith's faces use
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.800]  Apple watches hands like he's somehow genius that he is fished out he figured out where on the Apple
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.480]  watch OS the hands are stored and so he's he's not like replicating their hands he's using Apple's
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:56.240]  hands I didn't realize that that's awesome yeah it's really cool yeah and then I actually play
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.840]  this very small role in this I actually because I know him and I pinged him over the weekend is
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:09.560]  his first ones that the proportions were slightly off like his second hand stuck out over the
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:15.120]  you know like on that if you have a round watch and Apple watch and there's a little tick marks
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:21.120]  to mark the second a bunch of the faces have them the second hand should be exactly the the radius
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:27.280]  of those tick marks so that the tip of the second hand exactly touches the tick marks as it goes
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:33.480]  around his hands were a little bit too small and I helped him with a little bit of proportion sizing
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.240]  on that it's just the sort of thing you don't really notice but then once he fixed it he was
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.960]  like holy crap that looks so much better it's it's exactly right but these are amazing so the bigger
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.680]  question the question then is is this the kind of thing that Apple ever opens up or is that you know
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.480]  on purpose yeah I don't think they will I think that they don't and I think it is definitely on
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:00.500]  purpose for a couple of reasons and I don't it's not gonna make Apple watch users happy to hear me
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:05.560]  say that but I don't think it'll ever happen what do you think I can give you what I think the
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:11.680]  reasons are yeah what do you think they are I think one they don't want people to make ugly
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:18.760]  watch faces and if they opened it up for you know it's there's pros and cons to opening it up because
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.920]  some of them would obviously be beautiful I mean we can see from Stephen trout and Smith's work
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.960]  that's some of them are really beautiful and it would be so much more so much greater variety
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:35.280]  and choices but a lot of them most of them would be ugly and I don't think they want to allow that
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:42.360]  I actually I kind of know that the one watch face that is on Apple watch that they are deeply
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.800]  ambivalent about is the photos face the one that lets you pick a photo of your own to put on a
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.480]  watch and the reason they're sort of like is that a lot of people's pictures they put up on
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.000]  their watch are ugly and they don't like it but they kind of knew like that's just the one thing
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.280]  that the story I heard is that knowing how people set their wallpapers on their phone and stuff like
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.160]  that and how many people want to have a picture of their kids or their spouse or their dog and
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.680]  you know that's what they've done that's the wallpaper on their computer it's the wallpaper
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.520]  on their phone it's you know it's just what people do and so they got we got to do it we got to let
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:20.920]  people put a picture of their kids on a watch if that's really what they want to do but that's the
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:27.000]  one face that that can be ugly otherwise and and as many gripes as we've all had Marco Arment had
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.760]  a great story this week talking about the why all of effectively he was talking started talking
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:36.880]  about infograph like you said like with the nine-to-five article it was sort of like hey
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.320]  infograph is overwhelming by default but if you turn everything off and then just slowly start
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.840]  adding stuff back you can kind of keep it sane but ultimately very happy with how I have mine
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.120]  set up right now Marco makes a very convincing argument that all of the analog faces for Apple
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.600]  Watch are dissatisfying in some way yeah and you know you could solve that if you could open it
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.120]  up to third parties but I don't think Apple wants to do that because I they don't want to allow
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:10.800]  ugly watch faces and I think the second reason is it's probably even gonna be even less popular
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.420]  among people who are hoping to see custom watch faces on Apple Watch is I think marketing wise
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:21.880]  it's a huge they see it as a huge advantage that Nike and Hermes watches have watch faces
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:28.000]  that other watches don't have and that is true you know and some people said oh it'll be a
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.560]  copyright nightmare because somebody's gonna make a knockoff Rolex watch face and then Rolex will
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.120]  sue Apple and stuff like that like I don't think copyrights the issue because it's like people
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.520]  could make a fake Rolex watch face for the phone I mean you can do anything on the phone you know
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.840]  I mean I I don't I don't think the watch is special in that regard but I just but I do
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.960]  think though that like the they don't want people like Stephen trout and Smith making these watches
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:49:01.280]  that give you the Hermes look and feel without spending the money on an Hermes watch yeah it's
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.400]  interesting like the the copyright stuff yeah every once in a while you see something in the
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:12.920]  App Store that's a clear copyright violation but it seems to police itself pretty well like the App
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:21.400]  Store is not terrible yeah in terms of well I don't know I'm in if you look for it sure you'll
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:31.040]  find stuff wherever but yeah it's not you know the way that things work is the what rises up if you
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.560]  search I'm sure you can find Disney knockoffs or whatever but it's not like it those things can't
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:44.040]  become very popular before they get taken down so yeah the question is the Mickey Mouse face is
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.120]  another good example of that where there's obviously some kind of financial arrangement
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.640]  between Apple and Disney for the Mickey Mouse and the Pixar one and they're you know they I think I
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.960]  think they enjoy I don't know who's paying I don't even know who's paying whom they're right
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:05.440]  like who is paying is Apple paying Disney or is Disney paying Apple I I honestly that's an
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:11.680]  excellent question I don't know but I don't I feel like they don't want they don't want universal
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.680]  making one for the minions without Apple's involvement just you know here you go here's
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:21.160]  your minions watch face you know they like having that control so I don't think it's gonna happen
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:27.840]  what I mean them to me the argument would be out of functionality sake you know now that now that
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:34.760]  this watch face is basically becoming the equivalent of the panic activity monitor screen
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:43.840]  or whatever that you know it status board status board yeah I guess the infograph and the digital
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.080]  infograph provide enough of a canvas that you know you're more limited by what Apple allows
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:56.080]  you to do functionally than by how it looks necessarily or how it's laid out but I could
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:03.800]  see I could see a world of different possibilities of different configurations and you know features
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:10.480]  that a built-in watch face would never really support out of the box that could be potentially
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:16.880]  useful or interesting but it's it's it's been interesting to see over the years what they allow
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:22.360]  you to customize and what they don't like on the iPhone you know first you couldn't even set the
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:28.240]  background now you can so you can make your phone as ugly as you want it to write but you still can't
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:35.040]  can custom configure icons Apple is still the only I mean sort of like Major League Baseball
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:42.720]  Apple let you change the icon to your favorite team but I believe Apple is still the only calendar
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:47.400]  app that has the correct date right and then there are in their icon right and the way that
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:54.040]  their their clock app has a actual moving second hand yeah and is that just you know is that just
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:00.440]  a battery and CPU consideration or do they just not want to see us home you know the way that
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:06.440]  Twitter stop letting you use an animation is your avatar they just not want to imagine a world where
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:13.280]  every app icon is moving all the time right so I could see them being I could see a case where
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.680]  that obviously they haven't gotten to it yet there's there seems to be not much like they
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:24.920]  definitely seem to be aware how useful the watch face is like it is clearly the most useful screen
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:33.480]  yeah so they they're on to that as to whether or not they let you as the you know as a developer
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:41.560]  decide how the things are laid out or or the size or the functionality of them you're right
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:49.560]  it probably seems that seems like two or three steps beyond where we're going so yeah and again
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:54.360]  I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer here on this I just don't think they want to do it and and if
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:53:01.360]  I like as an outsider somebody who just is a customer and has an Apple watch I kind of wish
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:08.280]  they would allow it because I would I am vaguely dissatisfied with every single Apple watch face
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:14.800]  and I feel like if third-party developers could could make their own I could get one that I that
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:20.840]  I think is perfect and so me as a user kind of wishes they would open it but if I worked at
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.280]  Apple and I would it was my decision to make whether Apple watch would open the third parties
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.400]  I'd probably say no because I would selfishly I would enjoy the the fact that we have complete
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:36.920]  control over the watch faces and I do think that it's because Apple sort of sees itself as a quote
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:43.600]  unquote real watchmaker you know that they that they treat the watch a little differently than
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.520]  they treat other devices and they're a little bit more protective of what it looks like that they
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:55.400]  see the look of the eye every single watch face that they provide is like they think that this
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:00.680]  is copacetic with the Apple watch brand and once if they opened it up to all third parties that
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:06.200]  they'd lose that so I maybe the best case scenario and I know Stephen trout and Smith even said this
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.560]  on Twitter at some point over this thread is that what he you know what he hopes would be like a
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:16.760]  middle ground where instead of like the App Store where there's 10,000 10 10 20,000 developers and
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.640]  are all submitting watch faces if Apple just picked a limit a hand selected limited third
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:27.600]  parties to be able to bless them with the ability to provide third-party faces that that's an
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.440]  interesting middle ground and Stephen said that he'd be happy with that because if they had if
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:39.720]  if that was even possible technically he could hack it and make his own like he all he needs
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.960]  is for them to allow it in gen at all and then he could just make his own watch faces and it'd be
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:51.080]  fine for him that's what it's cracked it cracked me up really so I guess I could see them doing
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:59.000]  that but I don't know you know I also thought there would be more partners in the way that
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.880]  Nike and Hermes are partners by now yeah I did too I'm actually a little surprised how few official
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.160]  band partnerships there are and that kind of stuff so I don't know maybe they're keeping it
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.520]  tighter than and before but I also would not be shocked if next year watch OS was it five six
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:19.680]  six will be next has has face kit or something like that and even if it's limited in certain
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:26.320]  ways like for example I would I would be shocked if they didn't if you make an analog face I'm I'm
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.080]  nearly certain they would force you to use their hands like their hands are the brand way more than
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:39.440]  you know typically typography is how you establish a brand but like the Nike watch watch faces use
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:46.680]  Nike's font Futura condensed bold and they look very very Nike but they use Apple's hands and it's
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.720]  in the inner it's just very very interesting to me and I even talked to someone that Apple you know
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:57.280]  on the watch team who even talked about it that they were super they love their mess partnership
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:01.840]  and the Nike partnership and they're even inside the Apple watch design team they're just blown
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:09.400]  away by how and so happy with the way that these like the Nike faces can look both Nike and Apple
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:15.360]  watch II at the same time and that there are mess faces look so or messy you know with their
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:22.080]  distinctive weird but very distinctive typefaces that they use for the numerals and yet because of
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:30.360]  those hands it still looks very Apple watch II you know yes so I don't know I I wouldn't hold my
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.560]  breath on this but it is this this exercise that people are doing making these apps that just act
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.400]  like watch faces is fascinating to watch and it's just funny the way it just burst onto the scene
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.240]  and now if you look on Twitter and look at like Stephen Trump Smith's replies David underscore
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:51.320]  Smith is making some too he made nice did you see the one he made it was well a he made one that
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.680]  uses Roman numerals like tells like a digital watch that uses Roman numerals it just seemed
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:03.440]  like it was meant just for you just for me I just tweeted out of my said you should be arrested but
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.760]  he also made one that looks like the classic going is talking about classic Mac OS that looks like
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:15.800]  the classic Mac OS stopwatch cursor oh it's just this super fat 32 by 32 pixel grid of black pixels
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:24.240]  oh nice who I like that super cool yep I like that yeah and so I mean hey look this is one of those
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:31.720]  situations where like you know the the community could inspire Apple to change their change their
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:37.160]  approach you know if they see the the UI hate to steal your term for I don't know what Twitter apps
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:44.920]  the UI playground right now is is in watch faces so maybe maybe they'll see them and go crap you
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.680]  know I guess we got to figure something Ken Cascenda who adds that the book that just came
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:56.760]  out recently the you know creative selection which is a great book but he even tweeted and
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.760]  more or less in favor of allowing third-party watch faces which is that the story isn't that
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:06.960]  much different than it is with apps with the phone you know you get your brand new Apple iPhone and
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.960]  you open it up and every single app is there is from Apple and it all meets Apple standards for
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:19.080]  how apps should look on an iPhone and that's it and then you know if you want to go get third-party
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:24.080]  apps and you think that's there's ugly apps but you want to use them that's up to you but out of
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.600]  you know and this would be the same way with the watch face we're here we give you you know 15 or
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:33.040]  16 of these watch faces and they have a bunch of configurations and they're all approved by us but
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:38.000]  if you want to go outside that box and start downloading third-party ones that's up to you
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.880]  we'll ship you a watch that meets that we're happy with every every single watch face but we'll you
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:50.800]  know why not let people do it and in the meantime that there is the complications themselves are
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:59.040]  it's tricky it's not really this discoverability is pretty bad actually of good complications which
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:04.200]  is why that nine-to-five Mac article was so useful and really there could be a whole micro
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:13.840]  website of just cool iPhone or Apple watch complications but it's a start yeah what watch
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:21.120]  face are you using I have infograph right now I'm gonna admit to something embarrassing I still have
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:27.720]  a hard time figuring out what time it is with just the hands that's actually very common though
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:35.200]  that's actually not unusual I I'm I I get that because I remember as a kid my grandparents had
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:41.360]  a clock in their kitchen that didn't have numbers and I was like mind blown how does anybody know
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.320]  what time it is I'm right I was very proud of myself that I was able to tell time I feel like
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:53.360]  I was I could tell time on a clock at a fairly early age and I you know it seemed like an
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:57.640]  accomplishment and then I'd go to my grandparents house and I'd be like I have no idea what time
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:03.800]  it is I've none at all like without the numbers I had no idea in school we had the you know the
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:09.600]  the round clock but I had the numbers on it right and classic school clock yeah and a lot of these
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:14.880]  faces just don't have it but I just noticed that the iPhone sim tool looks exactly like the watch
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:22.240]  oh it does hand interesting all right good to know that is awesome so I'm using info infograph
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:28.840]  is that it's called yeah and I had the middle I still have the little calendar thing in the
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:33.000]  middle I turned off the white background I don't know why that's the default that's terrible it is
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.920]  terrible I that is baffling to me and it's so funny that it's the default but Apple's all of
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.880]  their product marketing shots show it with the black yeah I don't get it I don't get that either
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:49.840]  I almost feel like there must have been an argument inside the company and somebody won
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.440]  the argument and got the white one as the front face and the product marketing people were like
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.520]  well we lost that argument but we're still we're still not putting it on the box and we're not
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:04.720]  putting it on the billboards and we're not showing it in the commercials imagine the meeting yeah
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:12.120]  yeah so I have most of the stuff turned off however so I can too and there is an option to
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:20.440]  make the center a digital time yeah but the curse it's with the second it's not just the minute it's
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:29.280]  the seconds and the colons blink yeah and that I'm not into that it was too flashy too blinky
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:34.440]  it made me feel like there was a blink tag on a website I appreciate though that you're because
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.080]  it's true that once you start fiddling with it the little just the littlest thing like a blinking
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.640]  colon will drive you nuts I would actually pay five bucks for a cop for a watch app that has
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:50.200]  a complication that has a non blinking or configurable digital clock in the meantime I'm
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:57.720]  using the the world clock in the lower right corner with New York City and so I can see what
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:04.160]  it's but the other thing is my sleeve usually covers my watch so if I just creep the sleeve
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:11.080]  open over the right corner I can catch the time without having to unsheathe the whole watch which
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:17.920]  is kind of a nice little thing I used to use the color face on the old ones yes and that was the
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:23.640]  one I had that similar setup where I could just peek out the kind of the far corner of the watch
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:29.220]  and see what time it is without having to pull my whole arm out of my sleeve and then you know
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:34.500]  pretty simple I still have the calendar thing on I kind of like it I kind of hate it I don't really
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:42.300]  like the the showing your next appointment thing it's sort of useful when I'm at the office and I
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:47.680]  want to see like what conference room I'm supposed to be in next but it also is stressful so I might
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:56.280]  lose that at some point I I think that replacing like the 10 11 12 1 to our tick marks with the
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:03.240]  text right along the outer rim is clever but it's like too clever for me I'm like yeah I got tired
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:09.360]  of that after a day I was like that's that's too much yeah I might lose that otherwise I have I
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:15.400]  love the new weather thing where it shows you the range of temperature for the day absolutely I do
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:22.680]  miss the on the on the on the three I used the Explorer face because it would show you the
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.960]  cellular signal right I do miss having a good description of the actual weather whether it's
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:35.080]  you know raining or yeah or not some third I don't know I imagine like dark sky will do that
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.760]  but I had trouble getting that to work so I don't know yeah if you haven't tried it yet an app that
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.120]  I would really recommend is carrot weather car they don't like like what Bugs Bunny I haven't
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:50.720]  tried that carrot weather is sort of a it's very hard to describe but it's a very it's sort of a
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:57.480]  sarcastic weather app and you can dial up like it's not really the sarcasm I think I probably
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:02.560]  would have really loved when I was like a teenager and it seems a little too cute by far now but it's
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:08.480]  a great it is also a great weather app if you'd like turn off the thing that makes it talk to you
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:16.760]  sarcastically but the the complications it offers are tremendous it the watch stuff this it's just
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:22.000]  oh my god it's it's really fantastic so like one of the nine-to-five Mac I had the humidity on his
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.680]  info graph that's not nice he got that from carrot and it does the same thing as the weather where
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:32.160]  it gives you the range for the day oh cool so anybody's looking for some cool weather oriented
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.720]  watch complications check out carrot it's like I think it's a I think it's a free app and you
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:41.360]  have to pay five bucks you pay five bucks a year for a subscription to unlock all the watch stuff
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:46.280]  it's a great five bucks Jesus yeah it's really great and it gives you so many options you go
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:52.920]  to your phone and it's just like oh my god you can set it up so that it's like you so you can
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:57.800]  have two of them and it's like on infograph and if it's the lower left corner it's humidity and
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:02.900]  if it's the lower right corner it's something else so you can you can you can specify it to
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:08.520]  like the utmost if you want to fiddle around with it which of course I do yeah and to me
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:14.800]  like this is now inspiring a lot of ideas like could I do a chart beat complication that shows
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:20.480]  the traffic on recode for the day or something like that right you know how how many of these
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.480]  little and remember like spark lines there were again for five minutes like how many spark lines
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:32.400]  could I configure on this thing they can be really interesting so I'm just getting started with that
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.440]  and I really love the possibilities that it's that it allows and it is funny it's funny how
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:41.920]  many ways you can configure just the you know we're talking about wanting thousands of third-party
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.760]  watch faces but it's it's funny how much time you can spend especially to me it just seems like on
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:53.840]  series four with the infograph stuff it's like you can really just sink it 90 minutes into screwing
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:59.280]  around with your watch faces easily and some of them have like like 40 different colors to choose
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:06.240]  from yeah yep there's like 18 different shades of blue yes and I don't mind that but it is you
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:12.280]  end up you do kind of end up scrolling with the digital crown an awful lot to go through every
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:17.240]  single color I think they're trying to match every band they've ever shipped yeah yeah I think so I
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:22.640]  think it's like and and it's like they may only be selling 20 bands right now but they have like
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:28.560]  color options from you know the spring 2017 collection yeah yeah all right here let me take
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.240]  a break here thank our third and final sponsor before we get any further but it's it's our good
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:40.160]  friends at trace Pontus trace Pontus sells freshly roasted gourmet coffee and it is shipped directly
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.960]  to you their coffee beans are roasted to order your order and they are shipped out immediately
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.840]  so it's not like they roast coffee put it on a shelf and then it sits there for who knows how
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:54.240]  many days or a week or two weeks or whatever they're roasting coffee every day you place an
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:59.680]  order you get freshly roasted coffee and it goes right to you and it makes a big difference coffee
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:04.720]  is a perishable item I'm telling you and and it's like you can have weeks old coffee beans
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:11.040]  and it's not like it's undrinkable but it isn't like having freshly roasted coffee trace Pontus
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:18.280]  coffee is all it's named after the mountain range in Brazil and the race family re is has
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.640]  owned this family for generations and they've been making this coffee for over a hundred years
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:28.240]  hundred years three generations this family but for the most part most of that time they've only
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:33.520]  been selling it in Brazil now they have traced Pontus and they sell this coffee all around the
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:40.040]  United States and it's great and so what you can do you can go to trace Pontus calm or some coffee

[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:07.600]  I drank it all before we started recording enter that code at checkout the talk show at trace
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:16.360]  Pontus calm my thanks to them for making excellent coffee and for sponsoring this podcast anything
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:20.800]  else on the watch the only thing I had on the list to talk about was the the big hack which I don't
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.800]  know why don't we why don't we why don't we do that yeah I haven't done a show since this big hack
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:31.360]  thing came out and I guess sorry I do have one more thing in the all right all right let's get
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:40.520]  it out of the way look yeah I gotta say it this idea that the the cellular you know having having
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:47.640]  LTE on your watch will let you leave your phone behind the first year of that it didn't really
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:54.200]  work for me because I'd go walk the dog and realized three minutes in that it's actually
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:59.440]  kind of boring to not have your phone with you like oh it would be nice to have Instagram with
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:07.000]  me right now but there's there's now that you can do podcasts and it just feels like watch it like
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.720]  the new series 4 is fast enough that yeah you really do have a responsive device on you and
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.920]  not every app works like I don't know half the time the uber app doesn't look like it's working
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.720]  I don't know if it's gonna work now or not but it feels like we're finally getting to a place you
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:28.760]  know several years in now where this is a compelling device that is not going to replace
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:36.480]  your phone but it's certainly part of the whatever the you know the quote unquote this is kind of a
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.640]  silly jargon term but like the personal cloud of whatever you're gonna have in the future whether
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:46.320]  it is your watch and your glasses or your watch and your air pods and some other sensors like
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:54.240]  this is definitely we're getting to a place where you can see the shifts happening and it's a
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:11:00.440]  remarkable combination with air pods yeah it really does feel that and and to me it's exactly
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:05.800]  what you said it's with this watch OS 5 maybe I still have my personal Apple watch is still a
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:12.280]  series 3 and I I don't know how much is series 4 definitely feels faster you know but my series 3
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:20.360]  still works just as well and so I think it's mostly watch OS 5 and of a somewhat recent Apple
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.720]  watch whether it's this year's new one or last year's but yeah the performance is there I no
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:29.680]  longer and again maybe it goes app by app I actually don't think I even have the uber app
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.400]  on my watch but like with overcast like it never happens anymore well I'll go to launch overcast
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:39.080]  and I get a spinner and it just spins and spins and it's not like overcast fault it's like the
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:46.000]  system is just like the I don't know you know that just doesn't happen anymore it just launches and
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.080]  you hit play and it just pumps through your air pods right away and it just feels it does feel
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:56.640]  like the future and you know I you go for a run you you start the Nike app you start your run
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:04.080]  you play a podcast you change the podcast you use Syria to download it or stream a new podcast over
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:10.480]  the air you get back you stop your run and nothing is lost like it hasn't accidentally knocked you
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:16.640]  offline or and you know and and your battery still has the whole day's charge left yeah I
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:22.760]  don't know if it just feels like we're getting somewhere with this and it's gratifying yeah the
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:27.880]  one thing I sometimes miss is not having a camera because it just seemed it's like sort of like the
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.560]  Murphy's Law type thing like you know the way that if you drop buttered toast it's always gonna
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:37.160]  land butter side down it just feels like if I go for a run something interesting is gonna happen
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:42.160]  that I want to take a photo of that did happen to me yesterday yeah it's like oh my god I wish I had
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:46.320]  a camera and then if I take my phone with me nothing happens as absolutely nothing of interest
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.840]  I don't spot any interesting things to take a photo of but as soon as I leave without my iPhone
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:56.320]  there's some ridiculous scene or something that I wish I could take a picture of yeah and I don't
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.560]  think that's coming yeah it's a foreign factor wise it seems really difficult to get feels weird
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:09.760]  yeah all right all right the big have a big hack so that's that's Bloomberg's truly blockbuster
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:21.400]  story alleging that these servers from a company what was the name who semi I don't know elemental
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:26.720]  technologies and that and they're they're using they make the servers and they're there they've
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:33.040]  right so I'm super micro super micro which sounds like such a made-up sounds like yeah a made-up
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:39.040]  name it sounds like it was made up in 1987 which it probably was right I always thought Microsoft
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:48.600]  sounded like a made-up name right like Microsoft was such a like a typical just a typical 1979
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:56.880]  company name yeah in our industry but super micro makes these boards and according to Bloomberg was
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:05.760]  shipping somehow the the the supply chain got compromised and the Chinese the government got
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:12.120]  them to put these tiny little grain of rice-sized chips on the motherboard that that enabled all
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:16.400]  these superpowers where they could phone home and then they could effectively backdoor all these
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:23.120]  servers that were used in Amazon Amazon and Apple's data centers and then the then the story got
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.600]  really weird because Apple and Amazon both said adamantly no this didn't happen we've been telling
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.720]  them we've been working with them on this story for over a year and we've been telling them this
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:42.560]  didn't happen we don't know of any incident like this and it's very very strange and nobody really
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:46.160]  knows what to make of it the cynics the people who are cynical about companies like Apple and
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.440]  Amazon are you know and I get it but they're there they're they I've seen so many people
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:57.360]  read apples and Amazon statement and try to find loopholes and be like well here they say you know
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.640]  a B and C but they don't say D so maybe that's you know that's their little wiggle room but I
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.920]  don't think that's the case like if it turns out that this story is true or mostly true that it's
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:13.520]  fundamentally true Apple and Amazon look terrible because they denied it you know and they even said
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:18.040]  things like and we're not under a gag order because of the yeah right that was the one thing I was
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:24.960]  like no we're not under a gag order and they just denied it in a way that they never deny anything
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:32.320]  right they they put posts on their websites and you know they just they I I've never seen them
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:40.240]  deny anything on the record in public like that at four right and I mean and I think the situation
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:46.160]  calls for it like they're basically not only are they being accused of you know being compromised
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:51.920]  but in a way that you know makes it seem like they could be compromised again like you know they this
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:58.560]  thing got snuck in under their under their watch and you know and their and their dummies and they
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:05.200]  won't you know and they fell for it and and whatever but I've never seen them deny it now
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.640]  to me the one thing is like and it's kind of strange because they they were like oh more
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:17.520]  than 30 companies who were affected by this but I haven't seen much about any other companies
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:23.840]  and nobody's then right and and nobody has come up with it's been a couple weeks now nobody
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:29.040]  independent security researcher has gotten their hands on one of these and said aha here's the chip
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:34.160]  and and part of what makes it I I think there's some egg no matter what on Bloomberg's face
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.680]  because I think it was journalistic a journalistic crime to illustrate the story the way they did
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:46.880]  with they have like the cover of the the magazine that it shipped and had a fingertip with a little
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.000]  tiny chip on it and it makes it seem as though that's the chip and then there's pictures of
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:58.160]  a motherboard and they show a little tiny chip on it but that's it's all just like hypothetical
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:03.840]  right yeah fantasy basically right like these and but every so many people reasonably and reasonably
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:08.720]  so came away thinking oh they even have a picture of one of these compromised motherboards with the
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:14.560]  chip on it but that's not it's just like this is what it could look like you know it's very strange
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.960]  and to me it's very telling that nobody has come up with one yet because they're even you know they
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.640]  even said 30 companies were hit the the company was selling thousands of these servers so they're
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.280]  out there and apparently according to the story they didn't even the the FBI didn't even tell
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:34.800]  everybody who was involved like like they they because they didn't want to you know it was an
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.360]  American you know that that according to Bloomberg part of the story was that this elemental and
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:45.600]  super micro are American companies and they didn't want to cause irreparable harm to their reputations
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.800]  or something I don't know it's all but it's very very telling to me that nobody has come up with
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.680]  aha here I'm you know because some independent if some independent security researcher could
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:01.360]  come up and say here I found the chip on on this board that you know this company who you know
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:07.760]  hired me you know I found it and you know a lot of people have made the case that what they're
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:12.480]  saying they did maybe is technically possible but it would be like the hardest possible way to do
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:18.880]  this and that companies like Apple and Amazon really do things like photograph and and their
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:24.080]  motherboards that come in and make sure that there's no funny business on them like it would
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:29.680]  be so much harder to detect if they did something like this in firmware meaning the software that
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:35.040]  runs on an embedded chip so that the mother yeah right so like you've got an uncompromised
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.960]  motherboard and I've got a compromised one but they're physically the same the only difference
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.360]  is mine has bad firmware and yours has the right firmware you know that would be a much
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:52.640]  easy harder detect way to do it and would be easier I would think it's just super weird that
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:19:01.760]  that because the story quotes three quote-unquote apple insiders who you know that is one of those
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:08.160]  officials it's it's very curious that they quote quote-unquote apple insiders but that is also a
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.600]  very weird way to say it are they employees or are they some you know who are these people who
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:19.200]  are their sources that they blog for appleinsider.com right it's very strange so I have a
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:24.480]  theory about what is actually going on oh I'd love to hear it well my theory is that it is
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:32.240]  effectively just part of uh what's the word agit prop a-g-i-t-p-r-o-p it's just propaganda from
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:39.200]  the the trump executive branch who are trying to stoke the flames of the chinese trade war
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:44.560]  which is actually underway it's not like it's not like a conspiracy theory to say that the u.s is
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:48.880]  trying to engage in a trade war with china they you know they say it they come out and say yes
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:54.160]  we're having we would like to start a trade war with china and making china look bad and making
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:59.600]  it look like china is hurting good u.s companies like apple and amazon all fits in the narrative
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:06.320]  that that that the trump administration is trying to provide so I don't think I really don't like
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:09.840]  people have asked me do you think these bloomberg reporters made the whole thing up I mean are they
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.720]  committing fraud no I don't think so I mean bloomberg's a super reputable publication
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:20.320]  I'm sure they did talk to national security officials and that the national security officials
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:25.600]  told them these things or or said yeah yeah that's it because there was like a podcast that the one
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:31.040]  guy who was a named source came out on last week and said he was talking to the bloomberg report
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:34.240]  he doesn't know anything about the specifics of this case he was just giving them background
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:38.640]  information on what might be possible in a hardware hack and then the story like everything
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:42.720]  he said that they might do like the story says they did do and he was like that's either I'm
[02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:47.600]  really prescient or something weird is going on here so I think it was sort of like they got
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.920]  information from national security people who were just trying to get that story in the press
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.800]  that china is screwing around with apple and amazon and other company servers and bad china
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:03.440]  and didn't really give them specifics and they tried to get specifics and then they got like
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.880]  some hypothetical things ran it by them and they're like yeah yeah that's it sure whatever
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:12.960]  because they just wanted the story out there that's my theory and to me everything that's
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:19.920]  happened since fits with that and knowing and this is the one thing I was thinking like
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:28.240]  there's there's basically no situation in which apple can publicly badmouth china right because
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:33.440]  and that is stokes the cynicism of people you know you know that's why people are so cynical
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:36.960]  about apple's reply as well of course apple's going to say it didn't happen because they can't
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:44.320]  piss off china yeah you know not only as a place where a lot of people buy phones but also with
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:49.680]  everything they they have is made like if if for some reason apple had to stop doing business in
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:55.600]  china there would be no more apple at least for a long time right it would be devastating to apple
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:22:00.960]  right like apple it's probably the single biggest danger apple faces or certainly uniquely to apple
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:06.960]  you know that that you know you know the chinese government is an authoritarian communist regime
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:13.840]  that can really do whatever they want at any moment you know so it's truly at this point
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:20.000]  an existential threat to apple because you know at least you know maybe not existential but it
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.720]  would be devastating profoundly devastating right they would have to figure out how to move
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:31.600]  everything to brazil india where you know in in a matter of days uh not gonna not which is
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:36.000]  probably impossible or at least super hard or it would take years years to rebuild
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:41.280]  years and years years and billions and billions of investment you know it would be very difficult but
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:48.480]  so it's interesting how strongly they denied it while also you know not saying anything remotely
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:55.440]  bad about chinese government or anything like that um it just it's it's weirdly specific about
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:03.360]  certain things that either like are pure fantasy or had to have happened or i mean i guess there's
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:10.640]  a middle ground um but it just seems very weirdly specific about certain things it's interesting to
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:17.520]  me that none of these bylines are i don't think from their tech desk either like i think they're
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:23.680]  like i think this is the dc desk or something like that yeah i think so too i don't know if the tech
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:29.120]  editors were involved in editing it's been i haven't been to a good uh new york media cocktail
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:34.640]  uh party in a little while so i don't have the gossip on like who actually edited this
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:41.280]  right but you know you know still business week is arguably one of the highest standard publications
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:49.120]  that exists so they're not i would be really surprised if they kind of flubbed the i don't
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:53.920]  know if they have fact checkers but if they flubbed the i just i just think it all comes
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:59.360]  down to the they took they bought a bill of goods from these national security sources whose goal
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:04.480]  was specifically just to fan the flames of a trade war so yeah they've got sources who told them the
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:08.080]  things they're saying sources told them but i think the sources are the ones who were full of
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:15.200]  shit or exaggerating or gate were vague up front and then when asked could it have been like this
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:19.600]  that they were like yeah yeah sure whatever yeah you know they just wanted to see the story in
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:24.400]  print because it makes china look bad anybody anybody who believes the story it makes china
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:29.120]  look absolutely terrible and of course china's official statement was so cryptic
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:37.520]  it was like they didn't do themselves any favors by by issuing a statement that that was sort of
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:43.600]  a non-denial denial like who knows what's going on in cyberspace i think the chinese statement
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.920]  literally used the word cyberspace awesome by the way uh you have to look at the supermicro.com
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:59.040]  home page it looks it looks like it was made on uh adobe fireworks it it is this is a very 2002
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.880]  oh i would say like 1998 it's not even retina it's all rendered in graphics and none of the graphics
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:10.240]  are retina resolution so everything looks blurry has an amazing drop shadow that is cropped so you
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:17.600]  can see the hard edge on the shadows i will put a link to the super micro website in in this show
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.200]  that's boy super micro i don't know if they've recovered when i checked it they lost like their
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:25.440]  stock price took like oh yeah percent hit all right i got i'll put a link to that recode story
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.600]  in there too all right i guess we should wrap it up uh we've gone on long enough i don't really
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:34.400]  have much more to say about this big hack other than that i it's crazy i don't either i we'll see
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:42.000]  i mean i'm surprised there hasn't been anything corroborating it or uh or you know adding and
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.280]  they supposedly were reporting this for a year so i don't know well the thing that to me it
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:52.880]  you can't prove a negative but it it's very very suspicious to me that we don't still have
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:57.280]  corroboration because supposedly it was thousands of servers and they're out in the real world
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:01.920]  for anybody who knows their shit around a motherboard to say yeah here it is here's the
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:06.640]  here's the spurious chair here's one of these motherboards and here's the here's this rogue chip
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.360]  you know and the fact that we haven't gotten that yet is to me very suspicious again it doesn't
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:15.920]  prove anything but as time goes on and if it continues that nobody can show one of these
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:23.760]  compromised boards it sure looks like a bogus story agree yeah dan thank you for your time
