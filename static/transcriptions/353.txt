[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  Michael Stieber, welcome to the talk show you. I just want to say you made my week.
[00:08.560 --> 00:12.000]  Thank you. Thank you. I hear that you like the project.
[00:13.280 --> 00:19.280]  It can. It's like, I think you, you sent me a heads up maybe exactly a week ago,
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.520]  like over the weekend. And you just sent me in the shot me a nice little email and just said,
[00:23.520 --> 00:28.880]  Hey, I'm releasing this thing called the App Store time machine on Monday morning,
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.440]  this, that, the other. Here's a link if you want to take a look before it goes live.
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.840]  And I thought that sounds like an interesting thing. And I had like an idea in my mind of how
[00:38.560 --> 00:46.720]  good it was going to be, which was maybe not quite Minecrafty, but more on the level of like
[00:46.720 --> 00:53.360]  a Minecraft experience or something. Right, right. And then I down, I was like, Ooh, 1.7 gigabytes.
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.880]  Hmm. And I downloaded it and I was just like, what? I mean, like,
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.240]  if I had been wearing a hat, it would have popped off my head. So tell people for the people who
[01:06.240 --> 01:10.160]  didn't see my link to it or didn't stumble across it anywhere. Cause it was all over
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.760]  the Apple internet this week, but tell people what the App Store time machine is.
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.640]  Sure. So what I did is I recreated four different Apple stores at Tyson's corner,
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.640]  Stanford shopping center, Fifth Avenue, the original store, not the,
[01:26.640 --> 01:32.560]  not the current one and infinite loop formerly the company store. And all four of them are recreated
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.640]  to look exactly how they did on their grand opening days, down to everything, how the,
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.400]  how the tables are merchandise, the graphic panels on the walls. And, and I put this all together.
[01:44.400 --> 01:49.920]  I modeled it all and I put it in unity and added a first person controller so that you can walk
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.120]  around the stores just like you would have, except there's no people, obviously. It's just kind of a
[01:55.120 --> 02:02.880]  cool way to, to kind of revisit those places. And most of them are either gone now or they look
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.640]  different with the exception of the company store at infinite loop. It's, it's, it's mostly the same
[02:08.640 --> 02:14.400]  yet today, just obviously different products, but I was never around when the first Apple stores
[02:14.400 --> 02:20.160]  opened. I just wasn't following Apple at all at the time. So this was kind of a way from, for me
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.760]  personally to, to visualize it. But then also I thought other people might really enjoy it.
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.920]  When did the Apple retail stores first open? This is one of the, I should know, I should know this,
[02:31.920 --> 02:39.840]  but I'm going to guess 2001. Yeah. The first two stores, and this is something that, that I've had
[02:39.840 --> 02:46.800]  a lot of people write to me or, or mentioned to me that like, actually Tyson's Corner wasn't the
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.240]  first Apple store that it was a Glendale Galleria, but the first two opened on the same day in May,
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.000]  2001. And, and they opened just a couple hours apart because of the time zone difference.
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.640]  So, so it's always been like, which one's the first one. And, and there's some people that'll
[03:04.640 --> 03:10.720]  swear by that it was Glendale Galleria, no matter that it opened a few hours later, because it has
[03:10.720 --> 03:19.600]  the rollout number 001 where Tyson's Corner is 10. So there are people that will argue that either
[03:19.600 --> 03:27.440]  way, but my stance is that Tyson's Corner is the first one. I feel funny as me, John Gruber arguing
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.120]  over pedantic details and saying that somebody, somebody is being too pedantic. So I appreciate
[03:33.120 --> 03:38.320]  it. I think it's a, I would call it a tie though. It's sort of a photo finish if it's the same day
[03:38.320 --> 03:45.200]  and they're in different time zones. But so what was the year? 2001. That's what I thought. Yeah,
[03:45.200 --> 03:52.000]  that's what I thought. I am trying to think what the first was. I was living in Massachusetts
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.480]  outside Boston at the time. And the one that was closest to me and my now wife was in Rockingham
[03:58.480 --> 04:05.280]  Park, New Hampshire. And it was one of the first, it was so, it's such a weird time. You know what,
[04:05.280 --> 04:09.440]  let's, let's hold the talk on, on the actual stories and let's, let's focus, let's keep
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.480]  focusing on your project for now and we'll come back to it. But I will say it's, it's an inner,
[04:14.480 --> 04:22.320]  it, it's uncanny how much those, they feel like the original stores. And it's like, I knew it
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.400]  because I've, even though I wasn't writing Daring Fireball quite yet, it was a year before I did,
[04:26.400 --> 04:35.760]  but I obviously was still following Apple. I knew from my memory that a big chunk of the retail
[04:35.760 --> 04:43.040]  space in the original stores was devoted to boxed software. Like I knew it, I remember it. And I
[04:43.040 --> 04:50.160]  know that that's one of those things that really dates, you know, 20 years is a long time and it's
[04:50.160 --> 04:55.600]  like, yeah, that's a big difference. But then using your app, and again, it feels funny to
[04:55.600 --> 04:59.200]  call it an app. It feels more like a game. What do you think? Is it an app or is it a game?
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.880]  Yeah, I've tried to decide should I call it an app? Should I call it a game? What do I want to
[05:04.880 --> 05:10.720]  say? And I guess it, it feels a little bit wrong for me to call it a game because there isn't
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.200]  really a strategy element to it. And you're, you're essentially, you're just walking around
[05:15.200 --> 05:21.200]  the stores, right? But so I think like a game might give people the wrong impression, but
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.680]  yeah, it's, it's not quite like on what you would normally think of as an app either.
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.800]  Yeah. And experience?
[05:28.400 --> 05:29.280]  Sure. Yeah.
[05:29.280 --> 05:35.040]  It does feel a lot. And it's funny. We had some family over earlier this week,
[05:35.040 --> 05:38.800]  staying with us for a couple of days here in Philadelphia. And they had some of my young
[05:38.800 --> 05:45.360]  nephews and we took them to some of the museums here in Philadelphia. I had your App Store time
[05:45.360 --> 05:50.480]  machine in mind. It just seems like something built for a museum, right? Like the Franklin
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.960]  Institute here in Philadelphia has lots of stuff like that where you can like, Oh, see what it's
[05:54.960 --> 06:00.240]  like to do blank. Right. And it's like, see what it was like to go to the original Apple stores in
[06:00.240 --> 06:05.840]  2001. And that's exactly what it feels like. It's yeah, I guess it's not a game cause you don't play.
[06:05.840 --> 06:10.960]  There's no score. You don't win. There's no competition, but it's not an app. You don't do
[06:10.960 --> 06:17.040]  it. It's an experience, but it is amazing. And it's so different than say a video. Like if you
[06:17.040 --> 06:23.600]  had rendered, built the same models, but just rendered out a video of walking through, right?
[06:23.600 --> 06:28.880]  Cause you could do it at your own pace. Right. Cause like, I'm sure you've watched the video
[06:28.880 --> 06:34.160]  of Steve Jobs introducing the first Apple store and you kind of get the feel of the store when
[06:34.160 --> 06:39.200]  he's walking around Tyson's corner there and showing each of the sections. But there's this
[06:39.200 --> 06:44.240]  added dimension when, when you are controlling the camera, I think that really puts you in the
[06:44.240 --> 06:51.600]  moment. Yeah. Like for me, I spent an enormous time just sort of looking at the box software
[06:52.480 --> 06:58.560]  because I was like, it was, it was funny. It was so much of this box software and it just
[06:58.560 --> 07:05.120]  The box. Yeah. The box software was, was really funny to me when I was researching all the
[07:05.120 --> 07:08.800]  different titles. Cause like there were, there were actual books on the shelves,
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.680]  like four dummies book. Yes. Yes. You know, obviously there was like Microsoft office
[07:13.680 --> 07:18.640]  and things like that, but then there were, there were a lot of apps from smaller developers,
[07:18.640 --> 07:23.600]  which I thought was kind of interesting, but given the context that it was before the app store and,
[07:23.600 --> 07:29.840]  and really how significant that would have been to have your title on the shelf of every Apple store,
[07:30.480 --> 07:33.600]  which it's just kind of something I never really thought about before.
[07:34.640 --> 07:41.520]  Yeah, it was absolutely a huge thing and it was completely unlike the app store. It was
[07:41.520 --> 07:50.560]  finite. Right. And, and I'm sitting here emphasizing how dated it seems that they devoted
[07:50.560 --> 07:56.400]  so much shelf life to something that doesn't even exist anymore. It's not like they choose not to
[07:56.400 --> 08:02.640]  put box software on the shelves. There's, there's no such thing at least for Apple platforms. Right.
[08:02.640 --> 08:09.360]  I guess the last red holdout for box software would be the dedicated game consoles, PlayStation,
[08:09.360 --> 08:17.200]  Xbox, and red and switch. It, they couldn't put box software on the shelves if they chose to,
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.000]  and it's never existed for the iPhone or iPad, right? What do you, what the hell would,
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.240]  what the hell would they give you? I guess maybe like a lightning thumb stick. I mean,
[08:28.240 --> 08:33.840]  it doesn't even make any sense, but still even, even with me emphasizing how ridiculous it seems
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.160]  that so much of the space in the stores was dedicated to box software, super limited,
[08:38.160 --> 08:46.480]  right? And tons of it went to Microsoft and Adobe and Quicken and the big names of either some of
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.680]  them still big names today, or at least the big names of the time. So, so for the indie or smaller
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.720]  developers to get in there, it was super, super prestigious and I guess good business. I don't
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.800]  know. It's it's box software was always sort of a weird business to be in. The other thing that,
[09:02.800 --> 09:09.040]  that was really striking to me in the, in the oldest stores was how much space was devoted to
[09:09.040 --> 09:15.360]  third-party hardware, especially like camcorders, digital cameras. The first stores predated the
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.640]  iPod by a few months. So there are actually third-party MP3 players on the shelf from,
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.000]  from like the Rio. Can't remember the other names off the top of my head, but yeah, there were POM
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.400]  PDAs, just all this third-party hardware that's, that's slowly disappeared from the stores.
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.200]  And if you walk into an Apple store today and you, and you really study the, like the
[09:37.200 --> 09:44.240]  accessory shelves, there's almost no third-party anything except for a few different iPhone cases,
[09:44.240 --> 09:50.800]  like, like five different MacBook sleeves, or like they just have a very, very small selection
[09:50.800 --> 09:56.400]  for us. That's like, that was like half of the store originally. Yeah, definitely. What I,
[09:56.400 --> 10:02.640]  I remember from that era was it didn't take long. Obviously it was only a couple months. I don't
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.720]  even know if I, when I first went into one, I forget when the Rockingham one opened and there
[10:08.720 --> 10:12.800]  was another one closer to where I worked at barebone software outside Boston, forget the name
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.760]  of the mall it was in, but it was funny because they were identical. I mean, like, if you like
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.880]  kidnap me, put a hood over my head and then just put me in one of the two, which I was familiar
[10:24.880 --> 10:28.560]  with. I wouldn't be able to tell you which one I was in because they were like identical,
[10:28.560 --> 10:36.720]  which is a very Apple like thing to do, but it didn't take long for me to notice that like,
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.840]  if you were walking around the mall where there was one and people would, you'd hear people say,
[10:41.840 --> 10:50.640]  do you want to go to the iPod store? And I mean like super common, like the way that probably more
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.600]  people called the iPod touch the, I touched then called it the iPod touch while the iPod touch was
[10:57.600 --> 11:03.600]  a thing. People called it the iPod store for a long time, which for me as somebody who loved
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.120]  the Mac and knew that the Mac was the bigger deal of the things in there, or at least it was
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.640]  in my mind, it didn't annoy me, but it was like, huh, that's really interesting. And then it made
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.920]  me think like now we're getting into the very early years of daring fireball and people used
[11:19.920 --> 11:27.280]  to talk about the quote unquote, halo effect. That was the idea that, Hey, maybe the iPod is
[11:27.280 --> 11:34.720]  going to be good for Mac sales because it's introducing people to any Apple product for
[11:34.720 --> 11:40.480]  the first time. And then they're thinking, Hey, if the MP3 player was really cool, maybe I should
[11:40.480 --> 11:44.560]  take a look at one of these Macs. And I just remember thinking anecdotally hearing people
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.240]  call it the iPod store. Yeah, maybe there's something to that. It doesn't just seem like a
[11:48.240 --> 11:54.480]  spitball idea. It actually seems like something. I think it's interesting how much influence the
[11:54.480 --> 12:02.720]  products have on what the store design has to be, but at the same time, how little the stores can
[12:02.720 --> 12:09.280]  really rapidly change to fit the evolving products. So like the original stores were designed
[12:09.280 --> 12:15.360]  before the iPod was announced. And I'm guessing that the majority of the retail team had no idea
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.440]  that it was coming. And I would assume that the same was true with the iPhone given the
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.480]  secrecy, which it was developed in. And when you have physical real estate all around the world
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.480]  and a product comes out tomorrow and it completely changes your entire business, like it's so much
[12:30.480 --> 12:36.320]  more difficult to rapidly redesign all of your stores than it is to just, I mean, and I'm
[12:36.320 --> 12:41.120]  oversimplifying it obviously, but just to ship a new version of the iPhone, for instance, when you
[12:41.120 --> 12:47.680]  have all of these spaces that are leased, sometimes you can't just expand the store tomorrow
[12:47.680 --> 12:54.480]  because now your audience wants the new iPhone. And before it was just a handful of people in
[12:54.480 --> 13:01.840]  there for Macs. I think it's part of the right person at the right time with the right team.
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.200]  And again, this is like a duh statement of the obvious. Steve Jobs was a good CEO for Apple.
[13:07.200 --> 13:18.720]  But I do think he had the right mix of a plan and a grand vision and the flexibility to continue
[13:18.720 --> 13:27.440]  playing it by ear day by day, week by week, quarter by quarter, as the industry change,
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.520]  as facts change, as tastes change, as technology changed. So it's not like, oh,
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.080]  we've got this master five-year plan and we can't change blank because that's not on the plan.
[13:40.080 --> 13:47.840]  It's okay, let's adapt, right? But I think it's extremely clear in hindsight that part of his
[13:47.840 --> 13:54.320]  master plan was number one, let's fix the Mac and get the Mac. Without this, we're going to go under.
[13:54.320 --> 13:59.600]  We got to fix the whole Mac platform. We got to get a new operating system built for the future,
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.640]  go from classic to Mac OS X, built on the next technologies and taking the best of
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.920]  what Apple already had along with it. Let's fix the hardware, which was a confusing mess,
[14:09.920 --> 14:16.560]  simplify it with the famous four-way grid of pro and consumer, laptop and desktop.
[14:16.560 --> 14:23.280]  Here, boom, there's four Macs, pro laptop, consumer laptop, pro desktop, consumer laptop,
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.840]  consumer laptop, the iMac, go from there. But once we write that ship with the Mac, we need new
[14:30.480 --> 14:37.680]  products, new platforms because otherwise the company has to grow. And I think that was in mind
[14:37.680 --> 14:45.680]  with the retail plan from the get-go because one of the reasons people were so skeptical about
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.920]  Apple's retail plans was at the time, laptops were not the majority selling computers because they
[14:51.920 --> 15:00.560]  were so expensive. Desktops were, but desktops are super heavy. They were like the iMac was a CRT.
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.080]  It was like, I don't know, 27 pounds, right? And it's like, not exactly. I know people,
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.960]  that's what people did. They'd go to big box stores too, or gateway stores or whatever.
[15:10.960 --> 15:17.840]  People did buy computers in stores, but also it was sort of like when you go to a big box store,
[15:17.840 --> 15:24.240]  like Best Buy or whatever, you can buy something big and heavy. You check out and then you go into
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.120]  the parking lot and back your car up to the entrance and put it in the trunk or whatever.
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.880]  Doing the Apple stores in regular indoor malls was weird because it's like, well, wait,
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.680]  if you buy an iMac, and they had ways of doing it. Some of the ones, I think at one point we
[15:41.680 --> 15:47.280]  actually bought my wife an iMac at a retail store. And you could walk out with it if you want,
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.240]  but where are you parked? What you can do is do this, back your car around. And there was
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.800]  like a back entrance, like a loading dock where you can move your car. But it just didn't seem,
[15:57.360 --> 16:01.040]  if all they ever planned to do, this is where I'm going, is all they ever planned to do was
[16:01.040 --> 16:08.720]  sell Macs. And the Macs were going to be the same mix that was current in the year 2000, 2001.
[16:08.720 --> 16:17.200]  So retail space and malls did not make sense. To me, the whole idea was things like the iPod,
[16:17.760 --> 16:20.480]  things like the iPhone eventually, et cetera.
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.400]  Yeah. It's funny that you mentioned that with the size of Macs at the time,
[16:26.400 --> 16:32.000]  because there's a video out there from Grand Opening Day. It's from the Glendale
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.720]  Galleria opening. And I don't know, it was produced by some marketing team within Apple.
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.520]  And it's on YouTube. You can find it. They're talking to this family that
[16:43.520 --> 16:50.320]  purchased all of these Macs on opening day. And they literally have an industrial dolly
[16:50.320 --> 16:57.920]  from back of house up front in the store when they have loaded on it a big Power Mac G4
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.720]  tower and CRT display. And it's this huge stack. I don't know how you would ever
[17:02.720 --> 17:07.040]  walk it out of the store. It's funny. Yeah. All right. I'm promising people. I'm putting it.
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.320]  I wrote it down on a piece of paper here. I'm going to put it in the show notes. Glendale
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.480]  Galleria opening day video. All right. Let me take a break and we'll keep going. But first,
[17:14.480 --> 17:20.000]  I want to thank our first sponsor. And it's my good friends at retool. They've been sponsoring
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.800]  during fireball for a while. I think this is our first spot on the talk show. Retool
[17:24.800 --> 17:32.400]  lets you build internal tools like dashboards and admin panels, custom crud apps. If you don't know
[17:32.400 --> 17:39.040]  the lingo crud is I forget the acronym, but basically you've got a database. You want to
[17:39.040 --> 17:44.400]  make a little dashboard that shows the database in a friendly way. Retool can dramatically speed
[17:44.400 --> 17:50.400]  up how your business operates. You can build them from scratch. Of course, that's, that's the way
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.840]  people think. Some developers think that's a lot of work and it's a lot of maintenance and involves
[17:55.840 --> 18:02.640]  a lot of tedious work. Retool helps developers build internal tools much faster. It's a complete
[18:02.640 --> 18:09.760]  UI library with over 80 fully featured accessible components that you just drag and drop into an
[18:09.760 --> 18:15.280]  interface. You arrange them the way you want. And from there, you connect your interface to
[18:15.280 --> 18:22.400]  any data source, databases, Jason feeds, customize anything with JavaScript. You can just write code,
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.360]  you click on buttons. And what happens when you click this button, you just
[18:25.920 --> 18:31.520]  write the JavaScript that happens when you click the button, deploy your apps right within retool
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.880]  with app environments, permissions, SSO, and other time saving features available right out of the
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.720]  box. And the result is that you can build production grade business apps without Googling for
[18:42.720 --> 18:49.440]  component libraries, debugging dependencies, or rewriting boilerplate code. It is easy and fun.
[18:49.440 --> 18:56.320]  Thousands of teams at companies you've heard of like Amazon, DoorDash, Volvo, and Brex collaborate
[18:56.320 --> 19:01.760]  around custom built retool apps to solve internal problems and create new workflows. Here's where
[19:01.760 --> 19:08.560]  you go to learn more. Visit retool.com. That's all you need to know. No special code. Just go
[19:08.560 --> 19:16.320]  to retool.com and you can build tools up to 10 times faster. All right. You said, let's get the
[19:16.320 --> 19:20.880]  technical details out of here. You built it in Unity, you say. What does that mean? Explain that.
[19:22.560 --> 19:28.560]  So Unity is a game engine and it's a cross platform game engine, but this app is just
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.120]  for the Mac. Theoretically, I guess I could bring it to iOS, but I honestly, I didn't even try
[19:35.120 --> 19:40.640]  because I didn't figure like there was any chance that this would pass app review. I mean,
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.360]  Oh my God. Yeah. I didn't even think of that. Okay. Yeah. So, so I didn't even,
[19:45.360 --> 19:49.840]  I didn't even like look at, like I would have had to, to modify the controls obviously for
[19:49.840 --> 19:54.480]  touch and everything, but I didn't even go down that road. So yeah, it's, it's built in Unity,
[19:54.480 --> 20:00.880]  but the, the actual modeling of the stars is done in Blender, which is just a totally free
[20:00.880 --> 20:05.520]  3d modeling tool and it's extremely powerful and all the texturing was done in Blender.
[20:05.520 --> 20:11.200]  And then I brought those models into Unity and I'm not, I'm not a software developer by any
[20:11.200 --> 20:17.760]  means. So I just use YouTube tutorials, Googled stuff. And so I figured out what I needed to do
[20:17.760 --> 20:23.120]  to, to get a first person controller working. I wanted to add some different interactions.
[20:23.120 --> 20:28.480]  So there are, there are different computers within this, each store that you can walk up to.
[20:28.480 --> 20:34.000]  And like, there's an iMac you can boot up. There's one computer that's running GarageBand,
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.040]  and you can play a track on GarageBand. So there's different things like that I wanted to,
[20:39.040 --> 20:44.240]  to have in the, in the stores. And I just kind of hacked away at it until I figured out what I
[20:44.240 --> 20:52.000]  needed to do in Unity to get it all working. And, and then the result, you can build apps directly
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.120]  in Unity. Like you don't have to go through Xcode, but then they're not notarized, right? So the only
[20:57.120 --> 21:03.840]  way to open it is to go into system preferences and security and allow it. And it's kind of a
[21:03.840 --> 21:09.520]  mess. It's, it's not really, well, it's obviously not what Apple wants and it's not ideal really
[21:09.520 --> 21:17.920]  for any user either. So I did go down the road of getting a Apple developer account and, and then
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.440]  you can, you can send Unity projects through Xcode. And, and I had a little bit of help along
[21:23.440 --> 21:30.400]  the way getting, getting Xcode to then build the, the Unity project and then notarizing it so that
[21:30.400 --> 21:35.120]  I can distribute it without those security warnings. And again, I didn't, I didn't try to
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.800]  put it in the, in the Mac app store because I didn't figure it would ever get approved.
[21:38.800 --> 21:44.400]  Well, you should try it. I mean, at the very least. So I, what I would say is don't waste
[21:44.400 --> 21:50.880]  your time iOS-ifying it because that would be a lot of work, but you should at least submit the
[21:50.880 --> 21:56.000]  Mac. I mean, cause you've got the Mac version, right? So why not? I don't know. I get what you're
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.360]  saying. No, it's so, but this project is so off the wall. Like in terms of like, I, I it's, it's
[22:03.360 --> 22:10.880]  unlike anything I've seen. I get it. It's like, if I make just Joe random app, just to pull out
[22:10.880 --> 22:17.440]  any random app out of the app store and you put an Apple logo in your app, it's going to, and they
[22:17.440 --> 22:20.800]  and they see it, it's going to get flagged. And it'd be like, you can't, you can't put the Apple
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.560]  logo in your app. You've got the Apple logo in your app because as you enter an Apple retail
[22:26.560 --> 22:32.960]  store, one, one of the things that hasn't changed is the only signage I believe, right? It's, it's
[22:32.960 --> 22:40.640]  like the only signage they've ever had at any Apple retail store is just an Apple logo outside,
[22:40.640 --> 22:46.000]  right? It's one of the cool things that people don't think about, but it's like, they've never
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.920]  said Apple. It certainly never says Apple store. It's just an Apple. There's actually, there's
[22:51.920 --> 22:57.840]  actually like at least one exception to that I can think of. Okay. So I don't know if this still
[22:57.840 --> 23:03.440]  exists, but it was like this the last time I was there. So if you in Chicago, if you go to Apple
[23:03.440 --> 23:10.880]  Lincoln park, which is on the North side of Chicago, there is about a block away from the
[23:10.880 --> 23:17.600]  store. There is like a sign post where there's like acrylic, just like acrylic pieces printed
[23:17.600 --> 23:25.840]  and, and, and inserted for every store in the, in the upcoming block. And there's one strip of
[23:25.840 --> 23:33.680]  acrylic in there. It says Apple store. It's the it's set in Apple Garamond. And I don't, I actually,
[23:33.680 --> 23:41.360]  I have no idea why that sign exists because that store opened I think in 2010 and I don't think
[23:41.360 --> 23:49.920]  Apple was using Garamond in anything in 2010. No. Yeah. So, so that's the one exception to that I
[23:49.920 --> 23:54.000]  can think of that is kind of weird, but it's still, I'm going to say though, that doesn't
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.960]  really count as signage on the store, right? It's wayfaring. It's wayfaring signage near the store.
[24:00.960 --> 24:07.520]  That is, that is curious. Like it makes me think that it was somebody not involved with Apple who
[24:07.520 --> 24:13.200]  thought they were being helpful and nobody at Apple ever noticed. And it'd be funny if somebody
[24:13.200 --> 24:16.880]  listening to the show now is like, what the hell are they talking about? Looks into it and is like,
[24:16.880 --> 24:24.000]  Oh my God, get that out of here. But yeah, 2010 was clearly well into the myriad era of Apple
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.520]  branding typeface. So that that's doubly weird. Yeah. I'd say you've got to try submitting it to
[24:31.520 --> 24:37.520]  the app store and see the Mac app store and see what happens because the Apple logo alone might
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.880]  be the thing. And it's just somebody who doesn't even like, who knows? I have no idea what goes on
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.520]  with these reviewers, who they are, what, what sort of mindset they have. But if it's just
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.920]  somebody who doesn't even look at it and think, Hey, this is amazing. This is really cool. Maybe
[24:51.920 --> 24:55.200]  hadn't heard of it, but it's like, this is super cool. Maybe they're just like going through the
[24:55.200 --> 24:59.520]  checklist and they're like, Oh, there's an Apple logo flagged, but I could see it also going all
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.000]  the way to every single bit of this is Apple's intellectual property. You've got no chance,
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.880]  right? Right. But you've got the app, right? All you really have to do, the only effort it would
[25:08.880 --> 25:14.720]  take is these submission to the Mac app store. I don't know. I say you try it. I mean, I could
[25:14.720 --> 25:22.000]  certainly try it. One of the things I noticed looks right to me is the lighting. It's one of those
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.080]  things where feeling right is more important than technically being right. I think you nailed it.
[25:28.080 --> 25:36.880]  The lighting Oh, seems right. And seems super tricky. Cause like, again, I like when I linked
[25:36.880 --> 25:42.640]  to it on daring fireball, I mentioned to people, but here's the basic idea. Michael has recreated
[25:42.640 --> 25:48.880]  four of the original iconic Apple stores and you it's like a game like experience walkthrough where
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.720]  you can go through. Like, for example, I said like, maybe it's more like Minecraft. Like
[25:52.720 --> 25:57.520]  Minecraft doesn't, I, eh, I'm not a super Minecraft. My son used to play, but it doesn't
[25:57.520 --> 26:01.920]  seem to me like there's extensive lighting options in Minecraft. Like you just sort of go through
[26:02.480 --> 26:12.160]  and everything is, is lit with like a universal light source. Right. Whereas in, in your experience,
[26:12.160 --> 26:19.840]  the lighting is exquisite and seems realistic. Yeah, I had, I had pretty much total control
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.880]  over the lighting. There's kind of two tricks at play. And one is I probably didn't do it in the
[26:24.880 --> 26:32.080]  way that a real game developer would there's no actual live dynamic lighting and shadows in the
[26:32.080 --> 26:38.640]  game. So everything is, is all baked in and all the textures have the shadows baked into them. And
[26:38.640 --> 26:44.240]  the, the, so the lighting in the scene is all, is all coming from Plender where I modeled it. And,
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.840]  and that way I had really precise control over how I needed to light each, each part of the store.
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.960]  So like there, there's different lighting above each table. There's lighting in the,
[26:54.960 --> 27:01.360]  like the graphic panels, obviously are backlit. And then like on the newest store infinite loop
[27:01.360 --> 27:07.360]  along the displays on the walls, the avenues there's lighting in the top. Like there's a,
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.920]  an led strip that runs along each one. And it, it, it it's pointed a certain angle into the
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.320]  display so that it lights up the products on the shelves. And that's all the stuff I had really
[27:18.320 --> 27:25.440]  close control over in, in the Blunder where it is, it would have been not only a lot more CPU and GPU
[27:25.440 --> 27:33.440]  intensive to do it live. But I just wouldn't have had that same control in unity and it made it a
[27:33.440 --> 27:40.480]  lot, it made it easier for me to, to render the, the models in the store, like the, the,
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.680]  each individual iPod. And, and like, especially in the older stores, like the, the curvature of
[27:45.680 --> 27:52.080]  like the Power Mac G4 with, with a lot higher detail because I wasn't spending CPU cycles on
[27:52.080 --> 28:02.880]  lighting. Uh, the Power Mac G4 is the one that was still like a plastic case, but instead of being
[28:02.880 --> 28:10.000]  the Bondi blue of the G of the G3 one, that was like an iMac. It was more of a, I forget what they
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.040]  called it, like a slate blue. I think, I think they called it graphite. Oh, that's right. Yeah.
[28:15.040 --> 28:19.600]  Graphite. Yeah. Not positive. Nope. Yep. As soon as you said it, it was definitely called graphite,
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.720]  which was male. I was going to say perfect, but maybe there was a lot more blue in it than I
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.000]  would think the word graphite implies. But anyway, that's what they called it and you nailed it. It
[28:30.000 --> 28:39.600]  looks right. It matched the design of the G4 cube, which was the same time. So yeah, let's pour one
[28:39.600 --> 28:45.440]  out for the G4 cube, which, which has sort of come back in spirit, in my opinion, with the,
[28:45.440 --> 28:51.520]  the Mac studio, which is sort of the, it's the dream of the, the cube, which is the small
[28:51.520 --> 28:56.080]  footprint thing that you could put on your desk. I mean, the footprint is very similar. Obviously
[28:56.080 --> 29:05.280]  the new Mac studio is squatter than, than, but unlike the Mac mini, it is meant to be a pro
[29:05.280 --> 29:10.800]  level device. And I know I say that knowing that Apple has spent actually the last few years
[29:10.800 --> 29:16.880]  reiterating how many professionals actually use and love Mac minis. But to me, the Mac studio is
[29:16.880 --> 29:22.800]  more in spirit, but yeah, that was definitely it. Beautiful. I mean, seriously, I mean,
[29:22.800 --> 29:30.640]  the Mac cube is like, even though everybody in technology looks back and says one of Apple's
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.240]  rare failures, but there it is in the museum of modern art. I just love that. Here's this thing
[29:36.240 --> 29:42.240]  universally hailed as a failure. Yeah. And it's in the museum of modern art. What were you saying?
[29:42.240 --> 29:49.600]  The G4 cube I actually used as like the, the base for the, the time machine in the,
[29:49.600 --> 29:55.360]  there's like an intro video loop that plays when you boot the app. And I use the, the G4 cube to
[29:55.360 --> 30:00.960]  kind of represent the time machine that you're entering into. I tried to create like a backstory
[30:00.960 --> 30:05.520]  so that you, that you weren't just thrown into these Apple stores out of nowhere. Like,
[30:06.320 --> 30:11.280]  why am I here? What's going on? And, and I guess that is kind of a, a gameplay element, but I
[30:11.280 --> 30:18.880]  wanted there to be context to the time machine and like, why does the entire UI look like Aqua from
[30:18.880 --> 30:26.800]  Mac OS 10? Right. So, so like the, the, the story behind it is like, here's like a modified
[30:27.520 --> 30:35.040]  power Mac G4 cube. It's running time OS and, and there's like a, a boot sequence. And then you
[30:35.760 --> 30:42.080]  are entered into this like alternate reality when the, the the intro video plays from,
[30:42.080 --> 30:48.240]  from Mac OS 10. And then, then you're left on the main menu. So, so it was kind of a,
[30:49.680 --> 30:56.240]  when I started the project, I was originally going to just have the Tysons Corner model and then,
[30:56.240 --> 31:01.440]  and it kind of just, it got out of hand and I added three more stores. So, so that's why,
[31:01.440 --> 31:05.840]  that's why I used the Aqua interface because it matched the era of the store. But then
[31:06.640 --> 31:10.560]  when, when I started adding more stores, I'm like, well, I really need a reason
[31:10.560 --> 31:13.520]  for this interface. So that's kind of how that came about.
[31:13.520 --> 31:17.200]  Darrell Bock I say there's a long,
[31:17.200 --> 31:25.760]  glorious history and future of great labors of love that involve the phrase, it got out of hand.
[31:27.440 --> 31:36.800]  And then it got out of hand. Right? Right. Yeah, I, I, to me, the conceit, the rapper of the,
[31:36.800 --> 31:43.600]  of the experience is sort of like, what if Doc Brown from Back to the Future, instead of building
[31:43.600 --> 31:50.640]  a time machine to transport humans and dogs through time, physically in a DeLorean, what
[31:50.640 --> 31:57.520]  if he, instead of Jerry rigging a DeLorean, what if he Jerry rigged G4 Mac cube to take you back
[31:58.240 --> 32:04.240]  to 2001 Apple stores? It's, I just can't stop laughing at this. And I just love,
[32:04.240 --> 32:09.040]  and then it got out of hand, because that is, it just seems so obvious to me that that's what
[32:09.040 --> 32:15.120]  happened. I, when I, when I got the idea, because you sent me that email, and I got the pre,
[32:15.120 --> 32:19.280]  I got the preview link, and I was like, blown away. I'm like, I am definitely going to link
[32:19.280 --> 32:23.200]  to this. But then I thought, wait, this is not enough. I, because I have questions.
[32:23.200 --> 32:27.520]  And I started asking them. And then I thought, you know what, I should get this guy on the
[32:27.520 --> 32:31.840]  podcast, because this take for it would take forever an email, and then it's not out there
[32:31.840 --> 32:35.920]  for the world. But like, what did you do? This is one of the first questions I asked you by
[32:35.920 --> 32:43.360]  email, but I gotta ask again, what did you do to get, like the the dimensions of these stores?
[32:44.400 --> 32:52.160]  Like you? So, yeah, this, that was, that was really tricky. So I, as you can imagine,
[32:52.160 --> 32:58.320]  like, I searched for building permits. I looked at, all right, you say that. I, I, I can't
[32:58.320 --> 33:03.600]  imagine, but that does not seem like the obvious answer. The obvious answer is always to half
[33:03.600 --> 33:08.640]  asset. Right, but all right, you're starting, you're searching for building permits.
[33:09.440 --> 33:14.880]  Right, I searched for like mall lease plans, because sometimes, like, even if Apple's not in
[33:14.880 --> 33:19.920]  the same spot in the mall, like, they'll have the, the footprint of the store, like the square
[33:19.920 --> 33:25.840]  footage, and then I could work from there. I looked. Well, there are some, some dimensions
[33:25.840 --> 33:34.320]  like that I, there are some dimensions that I just knew. And I mean, I don't know how much I
[33:34.320 --> 33:40.160]  want to say, like, I happen to know, like, the exact length of the, of the graphic panel at
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.840]  Apple Fifth Avenue. So like, that was a good start. Like, it's only one dimension, but that
[33:45.840 --> 33:50.960]  was like a really good starting dimension for me to kind of figure out the rest of the store from.
[33:50.960 --> 33:55.920]  And, and I know like the exact dimensions of a standard Apple store table, like the thickness
[33:55.920 --> 34:03.200]  of the wood and things like that. So like, I was able to use like a few known dimensions and then
[34:03.200 --> 34:08.320]  like work backwards from there. And, and like, there are a couple, there are a couple of published
[34:08.320 --> 34:13.040]  numbers out there. Like if you go to, I believe when the, when the cube opened, like there was
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.000]  a page where like it listed like the exact dimensions of the cube. I think like maybe
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.560]  one of the engineering firms that Apple worked with, like published a summary of like the work
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.960]  they did. And so like, there were a couple of things I was able to use and, and-
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.680]  And that's the, for context, that's the Fifth Avenue, New York iconic Apple store,
[34:31.680 --> 34:38.000]  not the G4 cube, the, the cube up on the Fifth Avenue. Okay. So they published something about
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.880]  the cube itself, the actual glass structure?
[34:40.880 --> 34:47.440]  Yeah. So, and, and really the glass structure was kind of, well, I didn't want to go down
[34:47.440 --> 34:54.800]  the rabbit hole of like 3D modeling downtown Manhattan. So I don't, I don't let people
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.880]  walk up and outside of the cube, but it's up there.
[34:58.880 --> 35:03.760]  Yeah. Because otherwise now you're, now you're building an entire recreation of,
[35:03.760 --> 35:06.800]  of Bergdorf, Bergdorf Goodman across the street.
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.600]  Right. And I need the GM building and all that. Yeah.
[35:11.600 --> 35:18.800]  So for context, personally, your background is that you also, you, how you got into this
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.280]  and maybe how you got some figures for some of these things like the details of certain
[35:23.280 --> 35:30.560]  panels or the tables is that you have been a reporter for at least for nine to five Mac
[35:30.560 --> 35:36.400]  on the Apple retail beat. Maybe you've written elsewhere. I actually, I guess I should know,
[35:36.400 --> 35:41.840]  but you know, so you have sources in retail and, and as I like to call them little birdies,
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.000]  who maybe have given you information over the years or something like that. It's not
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.240]  like you came to this without any relationships whatsoever.
[35:51.200 --> 35:57.520]  Yeah. I've just, I've been studying Apple retail really since 2017 is like when I really
[35:57.520 --> 36:03.600]  got into it like day to day. And so I've, I've just kind of built this database of knowledge
[36:03.600 --> 36:10.480]  about, about Apple stores. I have an album in photos on my phone that has pictures from,
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.760]  from all of the store visits that I've, that I've done. And it's, it's, it's a lot of
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.600]  visits. And if you can, there's, there are, I'm going to just check right now. Let's see
[36:21.600 --> 36:29.840]  the Apple store album in photos has 14,200 photos in it. So, and that's all photos taken
[36:29.840 --> 36:36.880]  in and outside Apple stores. So like when it came time to, to build these models, I
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.240]  had this like huge collection of assets for things like what, what is the material of
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.480]  the floors? What, what type of wood is there? And I was able to build these textures for
[36:46.480 --> 36:51.760]  3d modeling based on this, this huge library of material that I already had.
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.840]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor is our good friends
[36:57.840 --> 37:03.360]  at memberful, which is where you can go to monetize your passion with memberships.
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.920]  Memberful allows you the creator who has a passion and an audience to build a sustainable,
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.360]  recurring revenue out of your audience. It's the easiest way to sell memberships to your
[37:15.360 --> 37:22.240]  audience. And it is used by many of the biggest creators on the web. You listening to my voice
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.960]  right now, quite possibly already subscribed to memberful sites, and you may not even know it
[37:26.960 --> 37:33.520]  because one of the great things about memberful is they don't put their brand in front of the
[37:33.520 --> 37:40.480]  creators who use them. They're just a backend and it's your site, your branding and memberful
[37:40.480 --> 37:48.080]  just provides that infrastructure to build everything you own your membership list.
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.840]  So if anything happens down the road and you'd like to move your membership system elsewhere,
[37:53.840 --> 37:57.200]  build your own thing, go to something else, you can just take it with you.
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.920]  That's how confident that's a, that's just respect to the creators who use memberful,
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.880]  but B it's a sign of confidence on memberful part that they just don't think you're going to want
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.200]  to do that because you're going to be so happy with memberful. It really is just a terrific
[38:13.200 --> 38:17.840]  service and they keep making it better. You have full control and ownership. That's that
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.560]  would be important to me. That's important to the people I know personally who use memberful
[38:22.560 --> 38:26.880]  and that's why memberful does it that way. And they also have a world class support team
[38:26.880 --> 38:30.560]  that is ready to help you simplify your memberships and grow your revenue.
[38:30.560 --> 38:35.120]  They can help you with technical details, but they can also help you with strategy.
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.560]  Like, Hey, how should I price this? What should I do? What works? Trust me. They know. And the
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.720]  reason they love to help the people who build on memberful is that they succeed when the people
[38:46.720 --> 38:53.680]  building member membership sites on memberful succeed. It's win, win, win, happy audience,
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.520]  who is happy to pay happy creators who are building a recurring revenue stream and memberful
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.800]  succeeds only when the creators succeed, you can diversify your revenue stream with membership.
[39:04.800 --> 39:10.880]  It is so easy. You can get started for free with no credit card required. It's just terrific.
[39:10.880 --> 39:20.080]  Go to memberful, M E M B E R F U L memberful.com slash talk show. That's
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.680]  memberful.com slash talk show, and you can get started. How long, how long did you spend working
[39:25.680 --> 39:31.920]  on this project, Michael? Do you want, and if you would prefer not to answer that question,
[39:31.920 --> 39:40.320]  you can just say pass. So, so, okay. So this project actually began with a smaller project
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.320]  I did while I was at nine to five Mac. And that was for the 20th anniversary of Apple retail stores.
[39:46.320 --> 39:52.480]  And I built, I built what was really the fundamental model of Tyson's corner
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.640]  way back then. It was a, it was a simplified version of it. The, the products in the store
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.080]  were modeled in a lot less detail. The textures were a lot lower resolution and I made it a,
[40:04.080 --> 40:12.320]  a USDZ, like an AR quick look file. And, and I published that when, when I published a big
[40:12.320 --> 40:18.560]  feature article about 20 years of Apple retail stores. So it was like a little desktop model,
[40:18.560 --> 40:25.680]  just, just like you would take like a model of like a Ikea chair and put it in your room.
[40:26.320 --> 40:31.040]  Like you could just drop this down onto your desk and look down into it like a,
[40:31.040 --> 40:35.680]  like a little Lego house or something like that. But, but while I was, while I was building that,
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.600]  I kept thinking like, it would be so cool if you could see this at full size and actually walk
[40:41.600 --> 40:48.560]  around in it. But like the limitations of, of AR kit, like a USDZ quick look file has like
[40:49.200 --> 40:55.680]  a lot of limitations on texture resolution and file size. I just, I just couldn't make it
[40:55.680 --> 41:01.760]  something that you could view that large and it still had an acceptable quality. And also you get
[41:01.760 --> 41:09.600]  like the like iPhones with LIDAR, I believe they detect where the walls are in your room. So the,
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.320]  the actual walls of your room would, would clip into the model because it's obviously
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.680]  bigger than any room you'd be in. So, so I kind of had this idea in the back of my head and that,
[41:19.680 --> 41:27.920]  so that was May 2021. And then in, in January, that's kind of when I started to really
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.720]  put in the work on this project and I took the, the model I had made of Tyson's Corner and I kind
[41:34.720 --> 41:42.000]  of tore it down, got rid of the parts that were low poly, low resolution textures, rebuilt it.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.280]  I added a roof because obviously the, the, the USDZ file, like you had to be able to look down
[41:49.280 --> 41:56.320]  into it. So there was no ceiling on the store and, and then the, the, so the modeling, I went
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.040]  store by store first modeling and then bringing it into unity, making sure that it worked. And
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.600]  then I started on the next store and that, so that took from January to July. It was,
[42:05.600 --> 42:12.400]  it was really like all of my free time and yeah. So, so I guess seven months, maybe,
[42:12.400 --> 42:19.040]  maybe a little bit more. The thing I love about it and, and I don't know, I don't know why it,
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.920]  it's happening now. It's maybe it's me being solidly in middle age. Maybe it's coming out of
[42:25.920 --> 42:31.520]  this pandemic, but maybe it's just the state of the world and the internet, but
[42:33.440 --> 42:40.640]  more and more recently, I've been just looking back at the earlier years of the internet and
[42:40.640 --> 42:47.200]  just thinking like, man, people used to just build cool things or build fun things and share them
[42:47.200 --> 42:54.160]  with the world. And people don't do that anymore. People it's not that no one does it, but it's
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.640]  like, it just doesn't seem like that's where people spend their time. People just get on
[42:58.640 --> 43:05.360]  Twitter and argue and post links to fun things. And that's it. As opposed to registering their
[43:05.360 --> 43:13.600]  own domain name and just putting something. Whoa, I, where the hell did that idea come from?
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.840]  Putting it up on the web, sharing it or making something else. If it doesn't make sense as a
[43:17.840 --> 43:24.560]  website, make something that people can download. And it's not a business idea. It's not, it's just,
[43:24.560 --> 43:30.720]  here's a cool thing. And I want to share it with the world. Your project is exemplifies it. This
[43:30.720 --> 43:34.560]  is what I want to see more people do. I want to see more people spend seven months of their
[43:34.560 --> 43:39.840]  spare time building something awesome for no practical reason other than that you just,
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.480]  I, I'm just imagining in your brain, you're like, I would like to build this. And then
[43:44.480 --> 43:48.960]  you're, you're thinking, I just, I need to build this. Right. It had to be a moment where you're
[43:48.960 --> 43:54.400]  just like, I have to do this. Yeah. Well, truthfully, you know, I, I really kind of
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.600]  built it for myself because like, I wanted to see what these stores were like. I've been so
[43:59.600 --> 44:05.120]  fascinated by, by Apple retail stores, but obviously like the Tysons Corner store is still
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.840]  there and it's right for now. It's still in the same exact spot in the mall where it always was,
[44:09.840 --> 44:15.600]  but it doesn't look anything like it did in 2001. And it's, it's something like, I can just never
[44:15.600 --> 44:22.480]  get back to without like just rebuilding it myself. So it kind of, it started just, just from
[44:22.480 --> 44:29.520]  that. And then I realized along the way, like how meaningful it actually might be to people who have
[44:29.520 --> 44:36.240]  a lot of memories of the stores or the products that everyone has their favorite iPod and, and
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.800]  just kind of be able to put yourself back in that moment and that place in time. So many people have
[44:40.800 --> 44:48.880]  said that it, that it meant a lot to them. I think that's how all creative, good creative endeavors
[44:48.880 --> 44:54.720]  have a story like that. I just, I'm lucky as I've gotten older and I have an audience and I know
[44:54.720 --> 45:01.280]  authors who write books. I know I'm an acquaintance at least of John August, who's, who's a pretty,
[45:01.280 --> 45:09.600]  pretty to say the least successful screenwriter. And it's like people who write the books that you
[45:09.600 --> 45:15.200]  love the most are writing the books that they themselves would love most to read. Stephen King,
[45:15.200 --> 45:21.600]  who's one of my favorite authors has always said that, right? Like he, if there, if you could like
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.320]  erase from his memory, one of the books he's written and then give him a copy of it, he'd be
[45:26.320 --> 45:32.160]  like, this book is amazing. This is fantastic. Right? It's, that's what creative people do.
[45:32.160 --> 45:38.400]  It's like, they build the thing that they want themselves, even though you don't get the
[45:38.400 --> 45:43.680]  enjoyment out of it as a surprise that anybody else does. Right? So now you've got these models
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.000]  and you can, you, Michael Stieber can experience these stores, but because you built them,
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.080]  you don't get the experience that I got when you just plop this link in an email to me over
[45:54.080 --> 46:01.520]  the weekend. And it came as a total surprise and just lit up the parts of my brain that shoot
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.320]  good feelings and chemicals through my body. Like this is so much fun, but it's, it's that
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.000]  self-satisfaction right? Like you just had to see this real. And, and then the other thing too,
[46:12.000 --> 46:19.360]  is there's that moment where like you, you, like you, you, you underplayed your skills. You say,
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.240]  you're not a developer and maybe you don't write code, but obviously you're talented with Blender
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.840]  and you self-taught yourself with unity and such. There had, it's that moment when you realize when
[46:29.840 --> 46:33.680]  you got good enough, like, well, let me watch some YouTube videos, see how to do this. Where
[46:33.680 --> 46:40.400]  you're like, Oh, okay. I have, I could, I could do this, right? Like I, I could do this. Now I
[46:40.400 --> 46:47.520]  have to do it. Yeah. It, it it's it's kind of a thing that just like one thing builds on the next
[46:47.520 --> 46:55.920]  and it started from, from just wanting to really research the stores too. If you go on, like I go
[46:55.920 --> 47:02.080]  on Flickr a lot to find, to find photos of old stores. Cause people used to post big albums from
[47:02.080 --> 47:08.560]  store openings and things like that. And the photos are always like a 640 by 480, like really
[47:08.560 --> 47:16.960]  like it's, it's so difficult to figure out what the title of a random Mac game is when the entire
[47:16.960 --> 47:25.200]  photo is 640 by 480. And this is one box on the shelf. And, and, and it's the only happens to be
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.800]  like the only photo of this shelf that was apparently ever taken. So like just the,
[47:30.800 --> 47:36.560]  the quality of it, trying to experience that through the photos that people took at the time
[47:36.560 --> 47:41.760]  is just like, I knew that I had to make something better than that.
[47:41.760 --> 47:48.480]  And it's not like Flickr. Flickr is still an active photo sharing service. It is, it's,
[47:48.480 --> 47:53.200]  I'm glad it's still around. I occasionally, cause I still have an account and over the years I've
[47:53.200 --> 47:58.560]  put some, I don't really, I don't know. I was going to say, don't really have, I don't have
[47:58.560 --> 48:06.160]  at all any kind of photo gallery widget at Daring Fireball. So if I have like, oh, here's the thing
[48:06.160 --> 48:11.520]  sometimes, I don't know, a couple of years ago, one of the portrait mode came out for the iPhone
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.960]  and I wanted to publish way more photos than I usually do in a review of an iPhone at Daring
[48:16.960 --> 48:22.000]  Fireball. So I put them into an album on Flickr. There's a bunch of articles over the years where
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.320]  I've done that. So glad that they're still around my happy paying customer. It's obviously not what
[48:26.320 --> 48:34.880]  it once was, but in terms of like the heyday of Flickr, it completely coincides with the era of
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.080]  your research. So that's, it's so great that Flickr is still around for that, right? It's like,
[48:40.080 --> 48:46.320]  Yeah. And I kind of, I felt this, this urgency when I was doing my research, because a lot of
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.800]  the accounts, what I would just say, just about every account that I came across on Flickr is
[48:50.800 --> 48:57.760]  inactive now. And, and I have like a list of links to different albums and like every once in a
[48:57.760 --> 49:04.640]  while I'll click on one and that, that album is now gone. So like, I have no idea how many photos
[49:04.640 --> 49:11.040]  like I missed that would have made this process so much easier. Yeah. And it's, what's, what's kind
[49:11.040 --> 49:17.840]  of funny is that Flickr serves this, this really important purpose in like cataloging a specific
[49:17.840 --> 49:24.000]  time that I think it's kind of sad that we're, that we're losing slowly. When I was researching
[49:24.720 --> 49:30.880]  Infinite Loop, that star opened in 2015. So that was like already in the Instagram era. People
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.200]  weren't really using Flickr. It was actually more difficult to find photos of that store opening,
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.480]  even though it was really only a few years ago, than it was to find like photos of like the
[49:42.480 --> 49:49.120]  Stanford mini star in 2004. Just because like, it's impossible to go back and find anything on
[49:49.120 --> 49:55.360]  Instagram. You can't search by date. The people seem to like wipe their accounts a lot more.
[49:55.360 --> 50:02.400]  It's and the quality of the photos, you've never been able to upload like the actual JPEG file
[50:02.400 --> 50:09.200]  from your phone. It's always a compressed version. So yeah, it's, I think it's kind of sad that,
[50:09.200 --> 50:15.920]  that we're really going to lose a lot of history when as Flickr just kind of falls apart.
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.240]  Yeah, it's funny because and this is total serendipity because I just posted a link and
[50:22.240 --> 50:30.960]  it's been a week of sort of bemoaning Instagram, jumping the shark, which has been a long, slow
[50:30.960 --> 50:39.920]  boiling frog ever since Facebook acquired it when it was indie. But it seems like 2022 is the year
[50:39.920 --> 50:45.600]  where they just sort of, yeah, we're just going to destroy the Instagram that was and build
[50:45.600 --> 50:52.960]  something, turn it into a tick tock clone or whatever. But even the Instagram of everybody's
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.200]  fondest memories, where it was just a simple timeline of sharing from people, it was never
[50:59.200 --> 51:07.280]  meant for like a historical archive, right? But you could do back in the day is if you knew who
[51:07.280 --> 51:14.560]  took the photo, like if, if it was Jason Snell, you knew that Jason Snell posted a bunch of
[51:14.560 --> 51:22.000]  photos of a store opening on his on his Instagram, then you could go to Jason sales, Instagram
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.560]  account, and click on his profile. And then there'd be a list of all the things that he's
[51:26.560 --> 51:32.000]  posted. And you could just scroll to the bottom and get there. But like the way Instagram is
[51:32.000 --> 51:37.200]  evolved. Yeah, it's like, it's, it's, they have no interest in it. So even though Instagram is
[51:37.200 --> 51:42.960]  still around, you know, to say the least, it was never meant for that. That's, it's really a shame.
[51:42.960 --> 51:47.840]  You mentioned 640 by four a and in sort of bemoaning it, but the back in the back when
[51:47.840 --> 51:52.640]  people were posting it, that seemed big enough for anybody. And it just, it's, it reminds me,
[51:52.640 --> 51:56.000]  I don't know if you've ever heard this, there was, you're probably too young, but like the
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.680]  original IBM PCs in the early 80s, in the DOS era had a limit of exactly 640 kilobytes of RAM.
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.760]  Okay, it was like a technical limit. It was really bizarre. I didn't even I never really encountered
[52:09.760 --> 52:15.520]  it. I never owned a PC, but there's a famous quote from Bill Gates that somebody, it was at a
[52:15.520 --> 52:18.960]  like a trade show or something. And they were like, Hey, what about this technical limit?
[52:18.960 --> 52:24.080]  It's only 640 kilobytes of RAM. And it was like, like, it wasn't just a limit in the hardware. It
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.080]  was like a limit in the operating system. So next year, there was no way to make a computer with
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.040]  more RAM. And supposedly Bill Gates said 640 kilobytes of RAM ought to be enough for anybody.
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.680]  And it's a super famous quote, but apparently, and again, I'm promise everybody I'm doing it
[52:37.680 --> 52:42.080]  right now. I'm going to put it in the show notes. He claims he never said it. It's apocryphal. It's
[52:42.080 --> 52:46.000]  like all the great quotes. It's one of the sad things in the world, all the best quotes, you
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.920]  know, of apparently the person you think said it didn't say him, but 640 by 480 pixels, that ought
[52:53.920 --> 52:59.840]  to be a big enough photo for anybody. Turns out, nope. When you're trying to build a retina level,
[52:59.840 --> 53:05.760]  full screen, high quality recreation of these stores, 640 by 480, not, not big enough.
[53:05.760 --> 53:10.160]  Yeah. Yeah. Not great. What else? So what else did you do? Any other
[53:10.160 --> 53:13.520]  research notes that, that are worth, worth a story?
[53:14.400 --> 53:22.160]  So there are a ton of small details that, that I think really, really sell the, the realism
[53:22.160 --> 53:27.520]  of the models. And, and they were things that I really was only able to, to track down because
[53:27.520 --> 53:34.160]  I've been paying so close attention to, to how the retail store design has evolved. So for example,
[53:34.160 --> 53:40.320]  like at Infinite Loop, there, there are the, the drawers of iPhone cases that you can open the,
[53:40.320 --> 53:47.840]  the wooden drawers. And inside each, each iPhone case and its packaging is separated by
[53:48.400 --> 53:52.400]  a little wooden divider. And that's, that's how they're all organized in the drawer. But
[53:54.080 --> 54:00.400]  Infinite Loop is one of the only stores in the world that actually has a drawer with wooden
[54:00.400 --> 54:07.280]  dividers in it. And if you go to any other Apple store with a, with a newer store design that has
[54:07.280 --> 54:14.720]  a drawer like that, and you pull open the drawer, what you'll find is like little brass dividers
[54:14.720 --> 54:21.120]  between each case. And they look like, like DDR2, like RAM sticks. They have like the,
[54:21.120 --> 54:26.320]  the little notches in the side and everything, but they're just like plain brass dividers. And that's
[54:26.320 --> 54:32.560]  what they've been using almost since the beginning. But like the very first few stores with that
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.160]  design used just wooden dividers between the cases. So like, there were like really tiny
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.480]  little obsessive details like that, that I, like 99% of people probably won't notice. But
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.240]  like, I spent like way too much time researching stuff like that.
[54:50.240 --> 54:56.320]  Trenton Larkin Not too much time, just enough time is what I say as the person who can identify the
[54:56.320 --> 55:03.200]  difference between Ariel and Helvetica in a snap of a finger. No, that's the sort of thing. That's
[55:03.200 --> 55:11.600]  why this experience is so awesome. Here's another one. The actual name of the app is, I keep
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.720]  forgetting it actually, shop different shop different. And I keep going, I'm a launch bar
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.800]  user myself. But I know a lot of people use spotlight. Some people use Alfred, but you hit
[55:20.800 --> 55:26.960]  command space and type the name. I keep typing time machine. And time is time machine, of course,
[55:26.960 --> 55:33.920]  is a hit. But it's right. It's not your project. It's time machine, the actual backup software
[55:33.920 --> 55:37.840]  that's been built into the Mac since probably around the time of these stores that you're
[55:37.840 --> 55:44.320]  talking about. Is that why you didn't call it time machine? So I, I was I was really conflicted
[55:44.320 --> 55:50.320]  on that. And I thought, well, yeah, time machine, I didn't want it to be the same as time machine,
[55:50.320 --> 55:57.920]  the Apple app. And I also thought that the Apple store time machine like that was way too long for
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.520]  an app name. It's it's going to be, it's just not gonna look good. So I went with shop different
[56:03.520 --> 56:10.800]  because I think it kind of it fits the the project like is you are going shopping, but it's
[56:10.800 --> 56:17.440]  it's very different. And and the shop different is also a slogan that Apple used when the very
[56:17.440 --> 56:23.520]  first stores open. If you go to like if you go on archive.org and you find Apple's homepage for
[56:23.520 --> 56:31.440]  May 19, 2001. It has like a rendering of the Tyson's Corner storefront and it says shop
[56:31.440 --> 56:37.760]  different and all the employees shirts and I think the shirts that they gave away at the openings
[56:37.760 --> 56:46.640]  originally they have an Apple logo on the back with like a barcode like on top of it and then
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.840]  right below it says shop different so like they use that slogan 2001 and I thought it was kind
[56:51.840 --> 56:57.840]  of fitting for this. That's it's that's great. I love it. But I do remember I shouldn't say that
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.840]  I forget the name what I remember to shop it's like I've been turned because I kept on preparation
[57:01.840 --> 57:08.240]  for this podcast. I kept opening it and it's like it's as a launch bar user. It's like all I need
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.440]  is a couple of letters of the at the beginning. So it's like command space SHOP shop return,
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.000]  but I do think I think the time machine thing is funny because I kept typing time machine
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.640]  and it was a hit and it's like no this isn't the time machine now.
[57:24.000 --> 57:31.040]  You mentioned building a our kit model type thing and I saw on Twitter and it's obvious
[57:31.040 --> 57:36.320]  it's like oh man this is so much fun to play on a big Mac screen. But it's like lots and lots of
[57:36.320 --> 57:43.120]  people on Twitter are trying it and then they're like oh this would be cool is it a AR experience
[57:43.120 --> 57:50.000]  if say a certain company based in Cupertino came out with like a thing you strapped on your head
[57:50.000 --> 57:56.240]  and had AR goggles or VR goggles in front of you. It's that I presume that's something that at
[57:56.240 --> 58:02.960]  least crossed your mind as a future direction to take the project you've already built.
[58:04.400 --> 58:12.240]  Yeah I've thought about a dozen different ways to make this project take another seven months
[58:12.240 --> 58:18.400]  and you know I would like to build a version of it that that was for like very powerful hardware
[58:18.400 --> 58:26.400]  and and that the so that I could make like really photo realistic texture resolution just just like
[58:26.400 --> 58:31.120]  incredibly detailed like you can move every product in the store things like that and I
[58:31.120 --> 58:38.320]  think it would be perfect for an AR or VR type experience. I just hope that if there is a future
[58:38.320 --> 58:43.840]  product like that that this is something I can bring over because I think it would be really cool
[58:43.840 --> 58:49.680]  you know in a more immersive setting. I do too it just seems obvious I mean it's super super good as
[58:49.680 --> 58:59.680]  is and and given the options you had for what to build it for I think building it for the Mac
[58:59.680 --> 59:06.400]  was exactly the right thing to do and even taking the app store would they approve it aside and the
[59:06.400 --> 59:12.080]  whole again I laugh I was chuckling there but I'm not the one who might have wasted seven months of
[59:12.080 --> 59:19.680]  effort right like but it exemplifies not to turn this into a bitch fest about app store but it
[59:20.480 --> 59:26.240]  exemplifies though your project exemplifies the sort of project or problems with the
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.560]  the order of app store approval which is spend all the time to build the thing
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.440]  then give it to apple and then you find out if they're going to allow it unless your project
[59:41.440 --> 59:46.880]  is something that you know is kosher for the app store right but if you're if you have the
[59:46.880 --> 59:54.560]  idea for a project and you're yours is to me a perfect example of hmm I could definitely see
[59:54.560 --> 01:00:01.760]  apple saying no and and maybe no on something as simple as you cannot have the apple logo so you
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:09.040]  could and maybe build the version that if you just took out the apple logos and and turned it into a
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.280]  circle or something instead then you could submit it or maybe they would put the kibosh on the whole
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.160]  thing because it's a reproduction of their intellectual property these stores but the only
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.480]  way you'd find out is if you'd built the whole thing and then submit it right and then you've
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:33.600]  got this thing built for the iphone so I think you did the right thing but a future direction of
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.600]  hopefully maybe moving it towards the goggles would be awesome and maybe now that it's out and
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.240]  you've got this thing and you're you've gotten some attention for it maybe you could figure out
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:51.760]  a channel to get like yeah you should definitely move this to ar kit for the apple glass or
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.200]  whatever they think we think they might call the the the platform before you actually spend the
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.880]  gobs and gobs of hours doing it or something like that all right let me take one more break here and
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.600]  thank our next sponsor and then what I want to do when we come back is talk to you about apple
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.560]  retail itself and get your thoughts on on that because it nobody builds a project like this
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.680]  and spends spends years reporting on it without having some serious insight into it but I want

[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.120]  all right it's funny to me to hear that that your original idea was just to do the tyson store which
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.960]  would have been fine and it still would have been fun maybe we'd still be here talking but i think
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.440]  no surprise the store in your experience i'm going to keep going back to that i spent the most time
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.280]  in was the cube as you called it the fifth avenue store in new york i don't know if that's the most
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.920]  famous one it's hard to say maybe it is yeah i i would say so but it it clearly it was more
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:14.160]  than a small leveling up right there was like the leveling down of the the mini stores which you
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.440]  have which is which is the name of the one that's the mini store in your in your in your app oh
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:26.720]  stanford stanford yeah and their idea behind that was that many malls have these sort of retail
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.440]  spots that are smaller footprint than the original concept of the apple store and that was an
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.840]  interesting direction for apple's expansion the thing that i don't think anybody would have
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.320]  anticipated because so many people when they started were thinking like this is doomed none
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.240]  of these computer companies that that make try to expand into consumer retail ever have any success
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:53.040]  so not only did they exceed with the regular stores now they have a series of flagship stores
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.480]  literally all around the world and the one in new york is well maybe they have two a couple
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.360]  flagships in new york but the fifth avenue one is clearly iconic i mean there's the big cube
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:13.520]  above ground and it's just such a weird space retail what wise right for i mean i know i'll
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.160]  bet because it's so iconic and everybody so many people go to new york a lot of people who are
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:25.440]  listening have been there but if you haven't it's really weird it is subterranean it is underneath
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.720]  a plaza on fifth avenue do you even know what was there before it was an apple store
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:40.000]  so as far as i know there was a sunken plaza in front of the gm building there and i don't
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.920]  remember if it was still sunken like when apple took it over or not i've really not seen too many
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.240]  photos of that but i know that it was pretty underused it wasn't a very successful area as
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:59.520]  far as i'm concerned and i mean i think it makes sense right you have all these skyscrapers along
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.640]  fifth avenue and then there's just a hole in the ground like people aren't right not really like
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.360]  oh what's down there so yeah so the i mean it was it's kind of a bold idea to to put the entire
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:17.840]  store on the ground right well and the other thing too is number one that's just tough period right
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:24.320]  to to make an a pleasant shopping experience that's underground and to have an underground
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:30.240]  store that people will get to that they would notice from the ground it's not like the
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:38.400]  big fifth avenue apple store is like when you go to a train station and you're underground
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.760]  and there's a dunkin donuts and a newsstand where you can buy magazines and stuff which makes sense
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.240]  for them to be underground because they're there to get the consumers as they walk to catch a train
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:57.040]  it's just a tough idea period and they solved that how do people know where it is from the ground
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:07.280]  with the cube which serves no functional purpose it's it's just there to be an icon a literal
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.480]  architectural icon i guess functionally it does let sunlight in because it's glass and you can
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:18.720]  see through it but it's like we the basic idea is we could build this big store underground and
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:27.040]  we'll put this big architectural marvel glass cube above ground and people will come down a very you
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.240]  know i remember when it opened it was it people obviously talked about the cube but the other
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.920]  thing that people talked about an apple including apple was the staircase which yes is also made of
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.400]  glass is it still the original staircase i don't even i i'm not quite sure i haven't been back
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  since they remodeled refurbished did they did they rebuild the whole thing i'm not even sure
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.640]  i've only i've only been to the original yeah the the fifth avenue store is like i think the term
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:06.240]  is a ship of thesius right so yes right so like nothing from the original store from from 2006
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:11.760]  which really isn't that long though there is nothing left from it at all it's it's an entirely
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:19.360]  new space and and really the the cube was completely dismantled and replaced in 2011 i
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.440]  believe they reduced the number of glass panels so that that first cube lasted just a few years and
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:34.320]  then they closed the store in january 2017 and it stayed closed until september 2019 and they were
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:42.960]  in the former i can't remember the name of the the the toy store that was fa o schwartz yes yes
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.840]  they were in there as a temporary space for for like over two and a half years while that
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.720]  that while the new store was built and they literally started over so they they tore out
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:00.560]  the the entire glass staircase they they lowered the floor of the entire store by i don't know how
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:07.200]  many feet but it's it's much taller inside now than it used to be and just it's it's much larger
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.760]  but there's literally nothing left when they rebuilt the cube the new staircase when you
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.560]  walk down there are like mirrored stainless steel panels on all four sides so you are in this like
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.480]  mirrored environment it's it's actually kind of it's not disorienting but it's it's it's almost
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.200]  like being in some type of like funhouse where you just you look all around and you see your
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:36.560]  own reflection on on every wall and the stairs are now polished stainless steel too so it's just
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.320]  it's this kind of like dazzling experience as you walk down the stairs but but yeah so the the
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:51.440]  original cube aside from the aside from the actual glass cube and staircase itself the store was
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.080]  really just a standard apple store with a few more tables than than in what would be in a large mall
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:05.280]  and and i think like people were able to to look past that because the the cube was so spectacular
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.480]  and and when they rebuilt it the the actual store matches the cube in in magnitude now
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.360]  yeah that's interesting that they lowered the floor i did not know that because like i said
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.520]  i haven't been back but that was one of the things was that it's like oh my god this cube is
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:29.360]  cool and like anything really worth seeing in person pictures and videos don't do it justice
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:35.760]  you go there and you see it and it's like this is even cooler than i thought from pictures and
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.040]  then you go down the stairs and then you're in the store and it's sort of like oh this is a little a
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.960]  it was a little sort of like yeah it's just sort of a bigger square footage regular apple store
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:54.640]  but the the low ceilings were not great it's actually sort of a downgrade from a regular
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.360]  apple store right low ceilings are not generally regarded as luxurious but you knew but on the
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.840]  other hand you knew you were underground and so it just sort of was like it was like like if you
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.560]  went to a regular mall and the ceilings were that low you'd be like what the hell is going on here
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.600]  this is weird whereas you know it was totally acceptable knowing you were underground the thing
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.160]  that's so in addition to the problem of solving well we've got underground space how do we make a
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:28.000]  nice store is tough no matter where you are in the world but the other extra tough thing for
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.080]  apple is the competitive nature of the company and the pride of being on what you know is arguably
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.600]  the highest end retail stretch in america i mean i guess you could talk about rodeo drive
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:48.800]  or there's other super high-end shopping areas but fifth avenue new york that's the major leagues
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:57.280]  of retail and apple obviously do do they compete directly against tiffany or any of these other
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:05.680]  brands gucci or whoever else is nearby on fifth avenue no not even at all but you know they want
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.320]  to hold their own right and it turns out they did more than hold their own they're probably
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:17.120]  the most famous store on that stretch yeah and and what i what i think is really fascinating
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:23.200]  about the cube is that it certainly is the most iconic apple store and i think a lot of that
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.160]  has to do with the fact that steve jobs was was directly involved and there's this kind of story
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:37.040]  about about how it came to be and and it coincided with the that early era of the iphone when there
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.480]  were huge lines outside the store and it got a lot of attention with the the press cameras and
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:49.680]  things like that but in terms of like architecture and magnitude of stores there are so many new
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.680]  stores that have been built over the last five years or so that i would say like really surpass
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:03.440]  the cube not only in in architecture but in their their physical placement like for instance apple
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.000]  marina bay sands which is in singapore it's literally a floating glass orb on the water in
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.600]  singapore and it's it's just so much more i mean i've never been there but you can just tell from
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.760]  the photos like this is this is at another level and and it's certainly like it's it's not like
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.160]  it's a hidden project or anything like that but i i don't think anything has been able to
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:35.200]  been able to surpass that that like legendary status of the cube yeah because and a lot of
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:42.800]  the other flagships are built into historic buildings in yes london and other cities i mean
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.520]  you i should ask you which some of the ones are and it's a great thing apple does is take a historic
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:59.440]  building that had fallen into disuse or and restore it to architectural glory and make it
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:06.160]  a thing that people want to go to right like it's one of the things about apple stores they're there
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:16.800]  it's it's high-end luxury architecture and it is totally mass market it is for everybody everybody
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.480]  is welcome and feels welcome to go into the store and you get to go into a world-class
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.680]  architectural retail experience but the ones that are built into historic things
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:36.240]  apple is respectful of the history right whereas the cube is all apple right and and i think the
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.040]  the historic preservation projects that apple does it's it's really kind of it's really kind
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:48.400]  of unfortunate how they get a bad rap and i know that you and i can appreciate the level of of
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.400]  detail that they go into into restoring these historic buildings but i know like outside of
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.720]  the apple community like especially the store at carnegie library in dc and and even tower
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.640]  theater in in la which opened last year like there's a lot of criticism about those projects
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:14.160]  that people think that apple just kind of went in took over some great historic space and now it's a
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.440]  cell phone shop and they ruined a historic building and so it's it's kind of a tough
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:26.800]  situation and and i think i think people have because stores like the fifth avenue cube they're
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:33.120]  so iconic people have in their mind that's what every apple store is like so they think like
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.480]  oh apple gutted this historic theater and now it's a glass box and and i think that's really
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.480]  been like a a perception problem that they've really struggled to overcome especially as they
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:51.200]  move into more historic buildings i feel like they've handled it very well which is that i
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.920]  don't think there's any path to them doing this that doesn't have that criticism and i think you
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:07.360]  just sort of do the right thing have the right attitude and you just have to ignore the haters
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:14.320]  and it's so cynical because they act as though the critics of these things act as though i don't
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.160]  have a specific example in mind but you know that imagine that there's some city and and they act as
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.040]  though it was a thriving public library where all the children of the city loved to come and filled
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:36.080]  the filled this place for the last hundred years and was still thriving and like the mean old mr
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  potter from the it's a wonderful life mean old trillionaire apple incorporated came in
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:50.640]  stole the lease and closed the library and turned it into a like you said a cell phone store
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:58.320]  and now the kids who up until apple did this love the place uh now they don't they don't have any
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.880]  books from the library and that that doesn't happen that's not what apple is doing i don't
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.200]  i don't think there's a single one of these that was a thriving it their historic buildings and
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:18.320]  and and his and notable architecture but apple's not taking over places that were thriving in their
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.920]  original use and buying them out because they have more money it's they're taking buildings that that
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:32.720]  no longer were you know the their glory years were in the past and i don't so i don't know
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:38.720]  what the critics think should happen to these buildings it's it's it's like a wishful thinking
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.840]  of a utopia where collectively somebody or we taxpayer money would just go to restore it
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.520]  and for what purpose that people would actually enjoy i don't know it's it's just sort of utopian
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.200]  foot stomping of i don't know some something something but it should just be for the public
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.120]  good and shouldn't be for selling consumer products yeah it's it's really kind of remarkable
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:12.560]  when when the tower theater store was just a rumor i happened to be in la for the adobe max
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.680]  conference and i thought well i'm gonna stop over and see what that what that building looks like
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:24.080]  i remember walking walking around on the sidewalk in front of the store and it's it was falling
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:30.240]  apart i mean it was completely closed there was like pieces like dangling off the building like
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:39.440]  it was it was falling apart it was in really tough shape and i mean then when i came back
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:46.560]  for the opening i remember rounding the corner and it was like nine o'clock at night maybe and
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.440]  the marquee was lit up a big letters tower and and it was just it was lighting up the whole block
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:00.160]  and and there was like this immediate like transformation of the entire downtown just by this
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.000]  one store and it was it was incredible what what they were able to do with a space like that and
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:14.240]  and like realistically like even in its heyday that building was a theater which was a for-profit
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:23.280]  business it wasn't like some community like some like sacred park or something that was taken away
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:29.360]  so i think once you if you look past the surface level and like it makes an easy like twitter post
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.240]  like to just say like oh look here was this beautiful building and somebody posts a photo
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.960]  of how it looked in 1920 and then here's what apple did to it but but once you once you really
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:48.640]  look beyond the surface there's there's a lot more to it i think it's sort of like to me it's
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:21:00.080]  sort of like toy story and it yes toys really aren't anthropomorphized beings with personalities
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:07.280]  and and like but in you know the idea what's the best purpose of a toy to be loved and played with
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:14.960]  by actual kids that that's that's what resonates about toy story right it's not realistic of course
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:24.560]  i mean but that that's the truth right and so like a toy that actually gets loved and played
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:34.800]  with by a kid to me is more interesting than a toy that an adult buys and and not only never
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.960]  plays with but actually doesn't even want the box dented or opened and puts on a shelf and you know
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.960]  i i've got stuff that i haven't actually i don't really i don't tend to buy things i keep in boxes
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.280]  but i get it if you do i'm not putting anybody down i'm sure that lots and lots of people out
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.600]  there who listen to the show have some favorite things that they keep in mint condition in a box
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.440]  or whatever but to me the one that gets played with that's more interesting right and that's
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.760]  one of the things i love about some of the photos in the designed by apple in california coffee
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:13.440]  table book my favorite picture in that whole book is the original iphone that's that belonged to
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:19.760]  evan's hankie who's now in charge of design at apple her iphone her original aluminum backed
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.840]  iphone and she used it seemingly maybe didn't upgrade herself to an iphone 3g the next year
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:33.440]  it's beaten to hell and it is the most glow it to me is the most beautiful picture in that whole
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:43.760]  book of beautiful objects because to me an iphone that is all scratched and dent and used is more
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:52.160]  interesting right and what if you if if a building were anthropomorphized to me what a building wants
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:59.040]  is to serve a purpose so taking a historic building that was sad if it had a personality
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:07.440]  and now has been restored and and is filled every day with people from the building's home
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:16.960]  city from all walks of life students to retired people people of every nationality and race they
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:24.400]  all feel welcome and come in from opening until close buying some of their favorite things that
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.520]  they own what what better purpose is there for a building it to me it's just sort of the knee jerk
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.120]  you know there's obviously problems with capitalism there's problems with everything
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.240]  and it's just the it's the worst system ever invented except for all the other ones right
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:45.920]  but it's like the idea that some people have that the entirety of capitalism is rotten to the core
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:52.000]  and a capitalist intent for these historic buildings is inherently wrong is to me go go
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.280]  go bitch about it on your website and we'll ignore you in the meantime we're gonna go enjoy this very
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:06.080]  nice store there's there's my rant i suspect and and i think that apple especially in the last
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:12.800]  couple of years they've really put some touches in these historic stores that that celebrates like
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:18.800]  the the original intent and the original history of the store and so for example if you go in the
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:26.240]  basement area at tower theater they have historic photos from from when the when the building was
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:32.480]  an actual theater and they have samples on the walls of different architecture elements from
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.760]  the store and they show how they restored each element so like there's like a plaster like an
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:47.120]  ornate plaster decal and they show like how it was when when they found it in the store and then
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.160]  like our preservationists did whatever to to peel back the layers of paint and to fix it up and they
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.200]  show you like this progression so you can really really get a feel for for how much detail went
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:05.360]  into every piece of it uh it's just really cool it's it feels more like a museum when you go down
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:11.520]  there oh man yeah again a lot of the critics too speak of it as though apple came in and bulldozed
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  these buildings and then built a cookie cutter generic apple store on top which when in fact
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.680]  they do the opposite like you just emphasized that when they come into the historic buildings
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:28.480]  they each one is unique each one is a unique project and they try to honor the history and
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:35.600]  preserve what's able to be preserved and document the history and do it with the most respect that
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.680]  they possibly can and i think that's awesome i think that it is it's the opposite it's not like
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.880]  well it's like the downside to apple's expansion into retail to me it's one of the best parts of it
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.920]  for for society as a whole is is rejuvenating these buildings and giving them purpose
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.040]  while respecting the history yeah i've watched some of the like city council meetings where
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.680]  apple has to present these projects and there's always a representative from the apple real estate
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.560]  team and usually maybe someone from foster and partners there and i've seen specifically
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.800]  they've said this is not another glass box like they go out of their way to emphasize that because
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:24.160]  i i think even at the city level that they face a little bit of pushback it's interesting to me too
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.360]  as somebody with a broad interest in apple as a whole and the apple way of doing things
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.080]  is that it's really the only thing apple the modern apple does and i've always defined
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.720]  modern apple is the post steve jobs reunification 1997 onward it's the only thing they do that's
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.920]  backward looking they're actually it's it's part of the culture of the company is not to dwell on
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:57.120]  the past to there's a steve jobs quote i'll paraphrase but you know when you've made
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.000]  something great what you should do is take a moment to enjoy it and then move on and make
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.800]  another great thing you know and there's there's exceptions to that they've brought back some of
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:13.280]  the six color apple logo stuff they've made some wallpapers for phones that have sort of a callback
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:19.600]  to that era and the logo and i i think it helps too you know and i think it goes along with with
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:29.840]  their very keen outspoken interest in lgbt equity obviously literally from tim cook on downward but
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:37.680]  that the classic six color logo draws associations to the use of the rainbow logo for lgbt
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.720]  type support so they do that there's actually a new ad campaign i just noticed on billboards here
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.880]  in philly for air pods i don't know if you've seen this but that sort of a bold primary color thing
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:58.080]  with a figure in a dark silhouette with white air pods in their ear which is a clear nostalgic
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:07.200]  callback to the ipod campaign from 20 20 years ago or so 15 to 20 years ago so they don't they
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.520]  they don't never look back but the architecture is the one thing where they're they're they're
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:19.280]  they're explicitly looking back and i think um you know when thinking about apple retail in general
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:26.240]  apple's mentioned it before in keynotes that they think about the stores as the largest product they
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.080]  make and it's it i think it's easy to dismiss that as like well that's that sounds great no but i i
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:40.160]  think if you really internalize that idea and think about the next apple store as just like
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.760]  the next iphone and everyone builds on the last and each one a lot of people think that all apple
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:53.840]  stores look the same right but does the iphone 12 look that much different than the iphone 13 like
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.640]  yes and no right if you if you know what you're looking for there are a lot of differences and
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:04.880]  i think that the the they really do think about the stores in that sense that this is this is
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:11.440]  another product that we make and that's i think that's what makes them fascinating and what makes
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:18.320]  it really the the area that that i've been studying for for so many years because it's
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:26.480]  it's endlessly changing that's it really it's really what it is well said all right let me

[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:11.280]  of the saddest things to me it is sad we laugh at it i mean and it's it is it is both funny and
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:18.960]  sad is like when microsoft launched their retail stores and they're very apple store like often in
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.240]  the same mall system where apple stores are because one of the things apple one of the
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.920]  little things apple is good at is figuring out where to put stores and then they'd build these
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:36.560]  stores that were not rip-offs i i wouldn't say they're rip-offs but the the clear low that use
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.040]  use glass have these tables let people just play on the computers without a hard sell like if
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:48.560]  somebody really just wants to come in the store and just like log in and check their gmail on the
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:53.040]  computer like they're not going to get bugged by a sales associate and then you go through the mall
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:58.320]  and the apple store is sort of like packed and then you look and there's the microsoft store
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:05.440]  and it's like crickets chirping like like if somebody somebody wanted to build the microsoft
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:10.000]  microsoft store time machine but wanted to come in and take some photos but they really don't want
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.960]  people in the photos well guess what you're in luck you could do it any time of the day i i'm
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:23.040]  curious what you think about that like what and i i it's it there's something different about apple
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:28.720]  in so many ways and it's hard to imagine how anybody else could build stores that are so
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:35.920]  popular as apple right google has some pop-up stores but you know who else could do it yeah
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:42.160]  and and what's what's really sad i think is that almost all the microsoft stores are closed now i
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:49.120]  wonder why yeah the the pandemic really like knocked them back and i think the only ones
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.120]  that they have left open are like a couple of their flagship stores if even those really i
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:01.280]  think there's there's two parts to it and i think number one is that the genius bar
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:08.640]  and the apple support experience is so important to the stores and i think that the stores would
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:14.800]  be packed if there were if it was literally just the genius bar and there were no products to look
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:20.880]  at the stores would still be packed every day of the week all hours a line of people out front
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.080]  before the store opens waiting knocking on the glass like that's just how it is there's always
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.040]  somebody that needs to get their iphone battery replaced and and i think that you just don't see
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:40.320]  that with with other brands like microsoft and maybe it's because that they don't offer the same
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:48.240]  support experience honestly i i couldn't tell you what what it would be like to get your surface
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:55.120]  tablet serviced or something like that and i think that people also are attracted to the
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.960]  architecture of the apple store right so even though the like a microsoft store or google store
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:08.320]  is distinct in in its own regard like the the design of the apple store is so eye-catching in
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:16.080]  a mall that you and the the lighting it's it's it just draws you right to it so there's like this
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.320]  natural interest in in like oh let's see what's going on there i just don't think anyone anyone
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.280]  has been able to match it the pandemic to me is is maybe it's the last topic we'll cover here but
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:36.480]  it's the apple store's role and and what it clarified is to me really fascinating here in
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:43.360]  philadelphia philadelphia was actually i don't know how encyclopedic your knowledge of apple's
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:51.120]  retail stores are but philadelphia actually if you if you chart it on an xy axis the size of a u.s
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:58.800]  city and how late it got its first apple store philadelphia is some sort of outlier by far the
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:04.720]  biggest story that city that was the last to get an apple store the the walnut street store is is
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:10.480]  like the only one in in this in downtown correct i mean that that is everything else is in the
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.760]  suburb yeah yeah that's correct i forget when it opened but yes it's the walnut street store here
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.320]  in philadelphia and i just happens to be pretty close to where i live and so i walk past it all
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:28.160]  the time including during the pandemic my my gut feeling i've never really asked around but my gut
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:36.240]  feeling is it is in fact that stretch of walnut street in philly would be the the premier retail
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:43.520]  district in downtown philadelphia center city we call it and i i think what happened is that they
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:50.000]  just were waiting for something to open that fit what they thought their needs were and it was a
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:58.080]  game i used to play beforehand like when something would close and i would think that that could be
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:03.120]  an apple store and then i'd wonder if that would be it and then it never was right down center city
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.600]  philly is philly is big but center city philadelphia is actually relatively small
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:16.960]  it's very walkable from end to end and i don't really think there's
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.840]  a market for another one i i guess i could be surprised if they opened another one in this in
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.640]  the city limits but yeah i've i've looked around i i'm not sure where they would put another one
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:34.160]  in philadelphia specifically because they've just become more picky over time yeah so like if you
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:41.440]  if you look at the malls that some of the earliest apple stores went into i think like they have these
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.480]  properties there now and they're committed to maintaining them in in most cases unless like the
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:52.320]  mall is is dying but i just can't imagine them ever opening a store in some of the malls that
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:59.920]  they're in now so i i think i think that they've compared to compared to other countries like the
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:06.800]  u.s is fairly saturated with apple stores like if you consider how few there are even in china
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.240]  compared to how many people there are there so yeah i think the the market for u.s expansion is
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:20.320]  it's they they'll choose and they'll wait as long as they need to to find the perfect property yeah
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.080]  the other thing with philadelphia is that in the suburbs there's the king of pressure mall in
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:31.360]  pennsylvania which is like 15 miles west but it's like i often tell people it's like the longest
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.440]  depending on the time of day and the traffic there's only one road to get there the school
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:42.160]  expressway and if there's a car accident it is the longest one one accident it's the longest 15
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.640]  miles you'll ever drive but if there's no traffic you could go there as you could drive as fast as
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.840]  you want and then on the other side of the river in new jersey there's the cherry hill mall which
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:57.280]  is can be depending where you are in center city you can get there in like 10 minutes in a car it
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.200]  is really close and they've been around the king of pressure one that was was is a they've since
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:08.400]  moved to a new small the king of pressure mall is huge one of the biggest malls in in america
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.680]  and they've moved to a new location it's it's really huge and cherry hill is a pretty big store
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:21.440]  so philly was well served just not in downtown but during the pandemic it was interesting to me
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:30.080]  as a pedestrian just walking by seeing the apple store come back and it was one of the first doors
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:36.640]  on that stretch when they couldn't serve people indoors because of indoor restrictions for covid
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.640]  they set up a nice tent and they took it down every night to shade people from the sun because
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.920]  one of the things that's perfect about the walnut street store is it's not just on the nicest
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:53.440]  stretch of walnut street it's also south facing so it gets it gets sunlight during the day and
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:59.360]  guess what it's all glass storefront but because it gets the sun and everybody had to be outside
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.720]  they put up like a nice tent so people weren't having the sun beat down on them they had cold
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.520]  water for everybody waiting in line and i'd walk past and you'd hear just a snippet of conversation
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.360]  and it's exactly what you think they dropped their phone and now it doesn't work the screen doesn't
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.240]  even turn on and or something like that people need help you know it's their it's their phone
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.760]  right they were there i i don't see given the pandemic restrictions and and being respectful
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.800]  of their the employees who work there i don't see how they could have been open more and and it was
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:35.200]  really an interesting thing as all of this retail that the most thriving area of retail in my
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.240]  hometown was all shut down you know or even with the george floyd right you know they got their
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:45.280]  windows smashed there was a i forget if it was a police car i think it was a police car
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.800]  was right you couldn't if you were making a move michael bay were directing a movie you couldn't
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.480]  make it up it was a police car right in front of the apple store that somebody threw a molotov
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.480]  cocktail into and it burned out the police car right in front of the apple store you know and
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.200]  now the glass got smashed and they covered it up and they let their employees i actually walk i
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.320]  have some it might even be on my instagram i get another call back to earlier in the show
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.400]  you know they boarded up the glass and they let their employees paint paint a collaborative mural
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:24.160]  on it while they ordered new glass and in the meantime they were serving customers while it
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.760]  was all the glass was boarded up it was a big part of bringing the city back and it again i
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:34.720]  think you can be if you want to be super cynical and just think it's just a cell phone store and
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:40.160]  it's just there to make the most currently financially successful company in the world
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.560]  even more successful i mean if you want to be that cynical go ahead but i don't know it meant
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  something here in philadelphia it really did i think that the the pandemic was a big reset for
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:58.560]  for apple's retail strategy and i don't i don't say that because somebody has told me that i don't
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:07.120]  i don't have any like confirmation of that but from my observations like i think it was it was
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:14.320]  a moment where whatever the store plans were going forward had to change and i think that
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:22.720]  their priorities had to shift and in terms of like new stores what what the existing stores are going
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.520]  to offer for services and and i think that new strategy is going to take a few years to really
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:36.960]  show itself just because of the fact that physical real estate only can change so fast and they can
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.320]  only roll out things to stores so fast but i think like for instance like apple pickup
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.320]  is one of the biggest changes since the pandemic so like the the new stores that have been built
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:55.120]  over the past year they all include a dedicated area in the store it's specifically marked this
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.840]  is apple pickup there will be like drawers in the wall that where they're storing customer orders
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.760]  sometimes like it has direct access to the backstage area and they've carved out these
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:14.160]  sections in new stores just for online pickup and then at all of the existing stores they've like
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.600]  cleared off a product table where they would have had iphones before and they have a little easel
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:26.640]  there and they've just turned them into dedicated pickup zones and i think that's one of the largest
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:33.600]  changes to the store format in quite a few years it's famously there are no like checkout counters
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:41.200]  at apple stores but i think the the pickup element is something that is only going to become
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.600]  more important as more and more people are buying online and i think as much as apple likes to think
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:55.680]  of its stores as places that you go just to visit hang out try the new products like there is that
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:01.520]  express component that's just really important right now and i don't think i don't know for a
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.440]  fact but i don't think that they would have moved in this direction quite so fast had the pandemic
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.720]  not really or had the pandemic not really shook everything up it accelerated it right it was like
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.640]  maybe that's what would have happened anyway and that's the way the world of retail was going to
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:25.120]  involve but the the pandemic just did a decade of acceleration in in a year i i can't let it slide
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.840]  because it's my i was gonna ask i was gonna save it but i'll get it out of the way now but well
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.160]  i'll save the question for you but my least favorite thing about apple stores is the fact
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:40.080]  that they don't have a dedicated place to go get in line to pay i hate it and it's a total
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.600]  maybe i get it that i've been to california enough times that it's an east coast west coast thing
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:50.880]  but the other thing is that they used to have it in the like like the the original stores that you
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.080]  modeled there used to be a place where you would pick up a thing and then here's the line and then
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:04.400]  here's the line and then you could go and get in line and pay and i like to get in line to pay i
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.560]  that's my least favorite thing about apple stores because it you you if if it's something you can
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.160]  just pick up off a shelf like an iphone case and you pick it up and now i want to buy it and you
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.560]  go up to somebody wearing the t-shirt and you're like can can i check out with you and they're like
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.240]  oh no you want to find that guy over there and it's like how am i supposed to know that and you
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.280]  and and the other the person you're supposed to go to is wearing the same shirt but there's somebody
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.000]  who can check you out i i complain about it less now because you can do it in the app and that's
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:41.040]  just that's actually what i do i just go to the app which was still i still find weird where it's
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.240]  like how does anybody know that i bought this but i mean i do it i don't i don't shoplift it to test
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:55.760]  the test the security but i the the years in between them having a a queue to check out and
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:02.560]  being able to do it in the app may infuriated me because i i it's like you're just wandering around
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:11.840]  guessing who to go to i hated it right and and i think i think the idea of it initially was
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:17.280]  i mean it made sense like the idea that you can just walk around wherever in the store and someone
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.640]  will help you and without a specific counter there's never like the appearance of like a line
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:29.840]  and waiting but but in practice yeah that that's probably the number one complaint that i see about
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:36.880]  apple stores and and i think part of it is that the the feature that you can scan scan and buy
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:43.440]  things right with your iphone that's up until like the last year or so they really never talked about
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:49.280]  it at all it was something that you would have to know before you went into the store and it's only
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.440]  since like last fall that they've started putting specific signage like on the accessory shelves
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:01.920]  that say like just they use actually app clip codes where you can just scan the app clip code
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:07.120]  and it brings up an app clip for the apple store app and then you can just check out right there
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:13.600]  and they really have not promoted that feature until the last year and so i don't think that
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:21.520]  the majority of customers even realize that's an option for them yeah i do but yeah well go on go
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:29.200]  on okay well the the apple pickup counter it functionally it looks like a checkout counter but
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.960]  but when you when you approach it you have to already have an online order placed right so
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.400]  in that sense it is that kind of central place where you know where to go when you enter the
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:46.400]  store but but yeah i i guess i would agree with you it is frustrating like when you
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:52.240]  want to check out you just have to kind of like hold up whatever you want above your head and
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.560]  kind of wave it around like someone like yeah i want the explanation for this why there's no
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:09.200]  line i for people who want a line i i honestly i i really don't know because in practice it's not
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  like they've been able to maintain the appearance of no lines because you often get lines congregating
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:21.200]  around a specific table where someone is helping people check out and you'll get lines for
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.800]  appointments so that like the waiting in line is like a big part of the apple star experience
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:33.120]  and yeah it is a little bit baffling to me i i'll just say though i do the other thing from the
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.000]  pandemic so i think on the one hand they're more friendly to online shopping and getting a pickup
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.720]  on the other hand i do think it reiterates the fact that they've come back and there's
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.960]  they're crowded right i've i've walked by or visited several since the pandemic restrictions
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:56.000]  and and have ended uh and it just serves to emphasize that there is something important to
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:04.720]  being talking to people face to face right and being in a room and feeling welcome and people
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.680]  like being in the apple store that's why people go there and and they're they look happy when
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:15.040]  they're in the apple store and i think that's the difference that's the that's the missing thing
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:22.720]  from why did the apple stores work and the microsoft stores didn't is people want to be
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:31.840]  in the apple store and the the the being there is uh meaningful and irreplaceable and yes you can
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.800]  every single thing apple sells in those stores you could just buy at apple.com or in the apple
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.920]  app on your phone and have it shipped to you and you could get free shipping on most of the stuff
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.520]  and in some sense that's more convenient right and i i certainly lots of the stuff i do buy from
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.480]  apple most of the stuff i buy i just get shipped to me i certainly didn't buy my studio display
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:59.280]  and walk it down walnut street it's you know but there are times where it's just nice to be there
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:05.600]  right and it's nice to see things right like what does that apple watch strap look like for real
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:11.600]  yeah one of the things that i was happiest to see come back it's it's been about a year now they
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.640]  they started bringing back the today at apple sessions that they host in all the stores and and
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:25.200]  i think really like i think they could have used the pandemic as an excuse to kind of quit doing
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.480]  that all together if they decided like it's it's not worth the money or something like that they
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.120]  could have just said well we're done with we're done with classes in apple stores but they but
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.560]  they brought it back and they've they've started programs like it's called creative studios so
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:48.240]  they they host like a series of events just for underrepresented communities in each city
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:55.520]  and they they aren't even necessarily programs that are available to to everyone that walks in
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:00.000]  the store it's sometimes it's the thing that you have to apply for it kind of depends on what what
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:07.120]  the specific city is but but then the events are hosted in partnership with the store teams the
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:13.200]  the creative pros at each one of those stores and yeah i i think that's that's like a really
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:20.000]  important part of what makes an apple store stand out from something like google's attempt at
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.520]  retail and and i know like in the apple community because a lot of a lot of people like you and i
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:34.800]  are very proficient with macs and iphones like the today at apple sessions are kind of ignored
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.600]  ignored because we all know how to use those features but but i think there are so many people
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:48.560]  that find so much value in in learning about how to use the devices that they spend all day on but
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:55.680]  they just never knew how much easier certain features could be yeah i think that's huge i do
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:05.840]  i think i think it explains the the to me the fundamental success of the iphone and ipad is
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:14.000]  that people who before they had an iphone or ipad used a computer because they were already on the
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.200]  internet and had email and they used chat and search the web but always felt like it was the
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:24.400]  whole thing was a house of cards ready to collapse and get gummed up and slow and and like don't
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.120]  change anything right like don't install anything that the thing they learned from installing
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.400]  software is all of a sudden now they have a tool bar in every browser window that they never asked
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:40.480]  and don't know how it got there to oh this is great and i can download apps and try new things
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:46.240]  and if i don't like it i just tap and hold and hit a red button and it goes away and anything i
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:51.360]  download and install isn't going to mess up it literally technically can't because of the
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:58.240]  sandbox and it it it just turns them from feeling like everything they do on their computers is
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:06.480]  going uphill in a struggle to oh this is so easy and i'm coasting downhill let me learn more and
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:13.120]  you you mentioned in the original 2001 2002 era they had all these books in the stores because
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:19.440]  they wanted you to like maybe get a book on how to get the most out of iPhoto because they wanted
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:26.720]  you to right you know what's a lot more effective and more fun and actually more people will do it
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.320]  than reading the book is sitting down for an hour and hearing from somebody in a class of all these
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.640]  other people who are in the same boat as you and if you're thinking like ah maybe i'm the only
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:42.080]  person who doesn't doesn't know how to create a shared folder with my family and photos here's
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:47.520]  all a dozen other people exactly like you or maybe they're not like you because they're older
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:52.960]  and younger and they're from different different in those ways but the one thing you all share is
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:59.200]  you're all there to learn how to do more with photos and that's a great feeling and it's it
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:08.880]  it is it you can't you you can't fully describe it with words why that's different than all being in
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:16.080]  the same zoom class at the same time right it is being in a real place with real other people
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:22.960]  and having a real person from apple in front of you it explain this to you and then feeling like
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:29.920]  hey i i actually feel like they want my question they're not just perfunctory asking do you have
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:34.880]  questions and hoping i don't they seem to really want to know if i have questions and and i do have
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.480]  a question and maybe it's dumb and they'll say no that's not a dumb question that's a great question
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:47.600]  and let me show you the answer that i i think there's also something that's really exciting
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.640]  especially like the the photo and video sessions that apple does where you'll go on like on a
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.080]  photo walk around the mall or something like that and and when you come back to the store at the end
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.840]  of it they'll use well you'll like air drop the photos you took to the creative pro that's
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:09.840]  presenting and then they will airplay those from their phone right up onto the big video wall and
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.600]  i i think there's there's something really exciting about seeing your work in that context
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:22.480]  and and what you're able to do in that session versus like it's being shared on screen in a
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:29.040]  webex call yeah yeah it's it's really neat and i think it resonates in a way that is truly
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.560]  important to being a human being and i i know that it could sound corny but it i think it's
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:39.280]  true and i think it's fundamental to the success all right bonus round here we go final questions
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.920]  okay i told you my least favorite thing about apple stores is they don't have a dedicated queue
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.880]  for i i here i have a thing in my hand i want to buy it tell me your what what's give me your
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.000]  biggest annoyance or thing or just thing you would change if it were up to michael steber
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:02.400]  to change the thing okay so i know this is kind of a big thing but the thing that i would change
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:09.840]  and it's it's a pretty big thing but there is this divide between the classic store design the
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:16.880]  stainless steel walls that look and the new store design which is the the avenue displays along the
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:26.000]  walls the the like terrazzo flooring the quartz walls that architecture style is fundamentally at
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.880]  odds with the architecture style of the classic stores so when you walk into an older store like
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:40.080]  like the one on walnut street the store was designed for an era of box software of big
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:48.080]  desktop max and it's it's harder to find the products that you want the store looks less tidy
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:56.320]  because it's the the new products are shoehorned into an old design and apple's kind of maintained
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:04.560]  both designs side by side and they've been pretty slow with remodeling stores to the new design and
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.640]  i think that if you walk into a new store and an old store back to back that that contrast is
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:16.560]  really striking and it's growing more striking by the year and i i just think that like it's
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:22.480]  really important for the the brand image really going forward that there's more consistency
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:28.960]  between the stores that's a good answer and i do feel it's funny because i don't feel like our
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:35.200]  our walnut street store is dated in general because i feel like that look is actually
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:43.520]  pretty timeless in and of itself but i know enough about the modern style of apple architecture
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:50.160]  including the way that the style is sort of unified with apple park there are aspects of
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.760]  apple park and the steve jobs theater and everything they've done and sort of big part
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:03.520]  of it to me too is sort of like the integration of plants yes like the apple store here on walnut
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:08.720]  street has no plants and it doesn't have any leather seats and like that's sort of the new
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:13.680]  style i i think if you you seem familiar enough with our walnut street store i think if they
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:17.360]  needed to do that they would need to find a bigger footprint and i don't know if they're on the hunt
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:22.000]  for that if they are they're in luck because there's a lot of a lot of retail openings in
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.880]  philadelphia so i wouldn't be surprised if there's actually a hunt going on if they're thinking that
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:34.000]  because to me that's part of the new style of apple retail stores is like root plants and
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.120]  seating and sort of an indoor park area for lack of a better word it's not quite so rectilinear
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:49.040]  just a perfect rectangle of gleaming stainless steel or i guess it's aluminum walls so that's a
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:53.120]  good answer all right and then what about your favorite little thing that maybe people don't
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:59:00.960]  really think about about apples apple retail stores oh wow that is difficult i thought maybe
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:05.280]  i thought maybe the other one would be the one where i put you on the spot so the complaint
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:10.320]  about the dated style the the dichotomy between the two architectures that's your complaint what
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:18.960]  about a little thing okay so i really love the tables in apple stores and i don't think that
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:24.880]  people really think deeply about what's going on with the tables and i actually i named
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.440]  my newsletter about apple retail i named it tabletops because i'm always thinking about
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:38.080]  the tables but the the tables so i'm sure that you remember like the the old television sets that
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:46.240]  were like consoles that like i do a wood box around the tv right yep so in a way like apple
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:54.560]  store tables are like console tvs where they're really an appliance disguised as furniture so
[01:59:54.560 --> 02:00:00.960]  there's so much going on inside the table from like the on the newest tables like the the cable
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:07.120]  is routed up through the leg of the table so that you don't see any any cable coming down from the
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.160]  center like on the older stores there's there's power management inside the tables right there
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:20.400]  are actual white wall chargers just like um like the the usb-c bricks that you get with like a
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:26.320]  macbook right they're inside the tables and they're there's complex like mechanisms inside
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:32.480]  the table for for routing cables especially like an apple watch display table which is actually
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:38.400]  on its way out but there's there's so much going on it's it's not just a big solid block of wood
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:44.480]  and i think a lot of people do know about at the back of the of not every store has these tables
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:53.600]  but actually i might be wrong about that but the the the tables you you can wave your hand over the
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:01:00.720]  table and the the outlets will like rotate out of out of the tabletop if you've never seen it
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:07.040]  it's it's hard to explain but there's a there's a wooden section of the table that physically
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:15.520]  turns and reveals power sockets and usb ports that are hidden inside the table so if you sit
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.960]  down for like a genius bar appointment you can plug in your mac or whatever and so like there's
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:30.160]  so much going on inside of what just looks like a huge wood slab that's a very good answer that's
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:36.080]  excellent all right let's wrap it up you mentioned so that was a perfect segue you mentioned that
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:42.960]  you mentioned that you publish a newsletter called tabletops where can people find that so that is
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:49.680]  newsletter dot michael steber dot com all right and i publish it every week and michael steber
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:56.640]  dot com it redirects to your seems like that's your main home page department map dot store
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.600]  yeah so so that's a project that i i started a while back actually when i was at at nine to
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:10.240]  five mac and it's it's a glossary of like of the different features in an apple store and and i
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:16.880]  would use it to link specific things in my articles when i didn't want to explain like
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:22.480]  oh what's what's the video wall every time i wrote a story because the audience was some people had
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.800]  never visited a store or some people were very familiar so i would just i would just link to
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.680]  certain things like that rather than explain it every time and but that that glossary is a little
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:38.240]  bit outdated i should i should probably update it but um it's maybe now that i'm finished modeling
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:45.600]  those stores it is again in the same way that your entire shop different experience is way more
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:51.600]  detailed than i had any hope that it might be the glossary is actually way more comprehensive
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.440]  than i was guessing that it was it is actually really really it's almost like a little like a
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.800]  book really really nice but anyway the home page at that site which i again i promise will be in
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:08.880]  the show notes has links to everything including the apple store time machine including your
