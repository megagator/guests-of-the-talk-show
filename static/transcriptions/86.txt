[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  You've got a bigger role on the show.
[00:01.600 --> 00:03.320]  I don't, we've never really talked about it,
[00:03.320 --> 00:05.520]  but you now have significantly,
[00:06.520 --> 00:07.680]  I mean, second to me,
[00:07.680 --> 00:08.680]  maybe even more than me,
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.160]  bigger role on the show.
[00:11.280 --> 00:13.960]  I gotta tell you the editing on your show lately
[00:13.960 --> 00:14.800]  has been outstanding.
[00:15.880 --> 00:19.120]  So Dave Whiskis now does the editing of the show.
[00:19.120 --> 00:21.640]  I don't, we actually were just talking about this the other day.
[00:21.640 --> 00:23.720]  I've actually never listened to a complete episode
[00:23.720 --> 00:24.960]  of the talk show.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.120]  I don't think I have either.
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.160]  Well, when I'm doing the edit,
[00:29.160 --> 00:31.280]  sometimes I'm just looking for, you know,
[00:31.280 --> 00:33.000]  where things overlap.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.360]  So I mean, I've listened to the whole thing,
[00:34.360 --> 00:35.800]  but when I'm doing like the editing part,
[00:35.800 --> 00:36.800]  I'm just looking for,
[00:36.800 --> 00:39.480]  it's kind of like looking at the matrix.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.320]  How long does it take you to edit an episode?
[00:42.360 --> 00:44.520]  The talk show, like a two hour episode
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.120]  will take about two hours in real time.
[00:48.120 --> 00:49.200]  Yeah, about, yeah.
[00:50.280 --> 00:53.320]  I think most people seem to say it takes usually
[00:53.320 --> 00:54.680]  about 1.5x.
[00:54.680 --> 00:57.560]  I think Marko seems to say it takes him around three hours
[00:57.560 --> 00:59.520]  for an ATP.
[00:59.520 --> 01:02.120]  Well, that's if the show is more than two people.
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.080]  A two person show is pretty easy to edit
[01:04.080 --> 01:05.000]  because things don't,
[01:05.000 --> 01:06.600]  you don't have a run into a situation
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.120]  where three people are trying to talk at the same time.
[01:09.120 --> 01:10.320]  All right.
[01:10.320 --> 01:12.600]  Yeah, that's probably the biggest problem, right?
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.440]  Is when you have,
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.880]  because your professional always has three people
[01:15.880 --> 01:18.400]  because it's you and Jamie and a guest,
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.720]  at least one guest.
[01:19.720 --> 01:20.560]  Yeah.
[01:20.560 --> 01:21.680]  And so I pretty much have to listen to the show
[01:21.680 --> 01:23.120]  of like every second of the audio
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.800]  to make sure that things are right.
[01:24.800 --> 01:25.920]  And that it's sometimes people
[01:25.920 --> 01:27.800]  monologue a little bit and that gives me a chance
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.440]  to skip ahead a couple of seconds.
[01:31.440 --> 01:32.840]  It's not like I'm listening to make sure
[01:32.840 --> 01:34.320]  that they're, I mean, I was there.
[01:34.320 --> 01:35.360]  I know what they said.
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.760]  So I don't have to worry about content.
[01:36.760 --> 01:39.120]  I'm more listening for audio and when things overlap
[01:39.120 --> 01:40.880]  and making sure there's not weird background noise
[01:40.880 --> 01:41.880]  and stuff like that.
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.200]  Cross talk is a big problem with three people yet.
[01:46.200 --> 01:47.000]  And it's, you know,
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.640]  some one person will stop talking
[01:48.640 --> 01:50.520]  and then the other two might go to say something
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.760]  and you get that handshake thing of,
[01:52.760 --> 01:53.720]  oh no, sorry, go ahead.
[01:53.720 --> 01:54.880]  No, you go ahead.
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.720]  It's weird.
[01:55.720 --> 01:58.920]  I'm in a weird position that I am,
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.800]  well, I'm not on, I don't listen to that many podcasts.
[02:01.800 --> 02:03.000]  I've tried to listen more,
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.640]  but my percentage of my average week
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.800]  that I'm recording a podcast is pretty close
[02:08.800 --> 02:11.520]  to the percentage of a week that I listen to podcasts.
[02:13.240 --> 02:16.920]  So I'm like, very, very close to being, you know,
[02:16.920 --> 02:19.520]  recording as many podcasts as I listen to at least time wise
[02:19.520 --> 02:21.880]  because I can listen to more than I record
[02:21.880 --> 02:24.880]  as you can listen in like 1.5x.
[02:24.880 --> 02:27.760]  And whenever I'm on a show, especially not this show,
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.240]  but like a special guest on some other show,
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.040]  like with, you know, like with Renee and Guy
[02:33.040 --> 02:36.040]  on debug, like we were a couple weeks ago.
[02:36.040 --> 02:37.520]  Yeah.
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.120]  When we're recording a cross talk always gets to me.
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.200]  And I think, ooh, that was horrible.
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.480]  I tried to say something and clearly it was like
[02:46.480 --> 02:48.720]  the second or so of latency with Skype
[02:48.720 --> 02:51.000]  and somebody else had already started talking.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.880]  And it is very difficult for the guests
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.560]  to autocorrect that, like you wouldn't real life.
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.000]  If we were recording around the table,
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.600]  you can make eye contact like, hey, I've raised your finger,
[03:02.600 --> 03:03.800]  I've got a point to make.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.360]  But once it starts on a Skype recorded show,
[03:07.360 --> 03:10.240]  it seems like everybody wants to be polite and stop.
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.400]  But then that's, you know what I mean?
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.080]  Yeah, and it seems like this could be solved with software.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.440]  Either, I guess there's an argument to be made for
[03:18.440 --> 03:20.440]  if everybody just does Skype video
[03:20.440 --> 03:21.640]  then you're looking at each other.
[03:21.640 --> 03:23.080]  But even that doesn't quite cover.
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.240]  No, you need like a, I guess you could do a thing
[03:26.240 --> 03:28.080]  where somebody clicks a button and they raise their hands
[03:28.080 --> 03:29.200]  like Webex have this.
[03:29.200 --> 03:31.120]  But you're not really looking at each other
[03:31.120 --> 03:32.880]  with the Webcam, you're looking at the camera.
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.400]  And everybody who looks at your video feed
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.080]  sees you the same way as opposed to, you know,
[03:38.080 --> 03:40.680]  if you're literally around the table
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.280]  and you're talking, I can specifically point to you
[03:44.280 --> 03:47.600]  and be like, you know, I've got some dad to this.
[03:47.600 --> 03:48.720]  Yeah, it's not probably gonna be the same
[03:48.720 --> 03:50.880]  as it is sitting around the table.
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.880]  And it always shows too because I know,
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.600]  I remember thinking it was a strikingly good podcast
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.000]  was the episode of The Bug, I think it was The Bug.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.520]  I opened the guy in Renee, I have so many goddamn shows,
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.080]  but it was the one that they were,
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.600]  they recorded it the day after the WWDC keynote
[04:09.600 --> 04:11.200]  or maybe it was the day of, I don't know,
[04:11.200 --> 04:13.600]  but they went to Macworld's office
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.920]  and used borrowed Macworld's podcast studio.
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.760]  Yeah.
[04:18.760 --> 04:20.800]  And they had so many guests, they had like,
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.240]  I don't know, there's like six or seven people
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.360]  and I thought this was gonna be a mess,
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.480]  even though it was a bunch of really smart people,
[04:26.480 --> 04:30.920]  you know, it was Ryan Nielsen.
[04:30.920 --> 04:32.180]  Ryan Nielsen was on,
[04:32.180 --> 04:33.320]  Drance was on,
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.480]  you know, it was more than I forget how many,
[04:36.480 --> 04:37.640]  but it was great and I just thought,
[04:37.640 --> 04:38.640]  this is gonna be crazy,
[04:38.640 --> 04:40.280]  they're gonna be cross talking all over each other.
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.800]  But because they were in the same room,
[04:41.800 --> 04:46.800]  it was actually remarkably well organized.
[04:46.800 --> 04:49.680]  I modified by the fact that guy in Renee
[04:49.680 --> 04:52.800]  and then Ryan and Drance are just the nicest people
[04:52.800 --> 04:55.080]  and nobody's gonna try to be a jerk in that room.
[04:55.080 --> 04:55.920]  Right.
[04:55.920 --> 04:57.240]  So you edit the podcast now,
[04:57.240 --> 05:00.160]  you're doing the editing for the talk show.
[05:01.400 --> 05:03.040]  How's that going?
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.560]  I mean, it's editing.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.600]  I kinda like it, it forces me to listen to the show
[05:06.600 --> 05:07.760]  and it forces me to listen to the show
[05:07.760 --> 05:08.920]  in a different way.
[05:08.920 --> 05:11.480]  Like you, I don't spend a ton of time listening to podcasts
[05:11.480 --> 05:12.400]  and it's not that I don't want to,
[05:12.400 --> 05:13.720]  it's that I don't have a commute.
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.520]  So I don't have like that time every day
[05:15.520 --> 05:17.480]  where that would be my habit.
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.520]  So having somebody else's show to edit,
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.360]  because I've had it unprofessional,
[05:22.360 --> 05:23.520]  I've done that for almost two years.
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.240]  I edit the TV show, the thing that I do with Renee.
[05:26.240 --> 05:28.520]  But that's like I was there during recording
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.560]  so it's not the same kind of listening.
[05:30.560 --> 05:31.880]  So it's interesting to listen
[05:31.880 --> 05:34.280]  and try to make editorial choices while it goes
[05:34.280 --> 05:36.440]  rather than like having a list in my head of things
[05:36.440 --> 05:38.320]  I just need to knock out.
[05:38.320 --> 05:39.320]  And then the other thing you're doing,
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.840]  should we talk about the standard?
[05:41.840 --> 05:42.680]  Oh, we can, yeah.
[05:42.680 --> 05:44.400]  I mean, it's weird, like it's not a secret,
[05:44.400 --> 05:45.600]  but we haven't really talked about it.
[05:45.600 --> 05:48.920]  Is you're also handling the sponsorships for the show.
[05:48.920 --> 05:50.960]  Like when people want a sponsor of this show,
[05:50.960 --> 05:53.560]  they're really, they're gonna be getting in contact with you.
[05:53.560 --> 05:54.400]  Right.
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.640]  But it's like, it's weird.
[05:55.640 --> 05:59.280]  It's, we're sort of, maybe it's probably all my fault
[05:59.280 --> 06:01.560]  where the transition, the transition from Mule
[06:01.560 --> 06:06.160]  to hosting an undering fireball was sort of one weird thing
[06:06.160 --> 06:07.520]  at a time.
[06:07.520 --> 06:09.400]  And now it's like we're up off the air
[06:09.400 --> 06:12.040]  and it's working and nobody's complaining at all.
[06:12.040 --> 06:13.400]  I don't think we've had any complaints.
[06:13.400 --> 06:15.760]  So it seems like the feed keeps working.
[06:15.760 --> 06:19.800]  You know, SoundCloud for hosting has worked just fine.
[06:19.800 --> 06:22.440]  Nobody really seems to have missed a beat.
[06:22.440 --> 06:25.320]  The download numbers are completely on par
[06:25.320 --> 06:26.760]  with where they were.
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.280]  I'll say this about editing.
[06:28.280 --> 06:31.240]  It's forced me to really evaluate audio quality
[06:31.240 --> 06:32.920]  because you know, people, more people listen
[06:32.920 --> 06:34.320]  to your show than listen to my show.
[06:34.320 --> 06:36.400]  And so suddenly I have to care about
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.240]  how well encoded it might be three.
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.880]  So I've changed my workflow there.
[06:39.880 --> 06:44.880]  Why do you use MP3 instead of AAC?
[06:44.880 --> 06:48.200]  You know, I don't know, I never really thought about it.
[06:48.200 --> 06:51.240]  My assumption is that MP3 is gonna be the thing
[06:51.240 --> 06:53.440]  that the most people would be able to play.
[06:53.440 --> 06:54.640]  Yeah, that's what I would think too.
[06:54.640 --> 06:56.400]  That's why I've always gone with that.
[06:56.400 --> 06:59.240]  Actually, I guess I didn't choose with Mule.
[06:59.240 --> 07:03.680]  When I was with Mule, that was, I just sent them audio
[07:03.680 --> 07:06.360]  and then the podcast went up and there was no choice
[07:06.360 --> 07:10.880]  but the show's been MP3 as long as I can remember.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.520]  I think ATP though is AAC.
[07:14.520 --> 07:15.400]  That wouldn't surprise me.
[07:15.400 --> 07:17.200]  That sounds like a Marco thing to do.
[07:17.200 --> 07:18.760]  Yeah, it seems like something I would do too.
[07:18.760 --> 07:19.600]  I don't know.
[07:19.600 --> 07:21.760]  I would be very surprised if the percentage of people
[07:21.760 --> 07:23.320]  who listen to the talk show,
[07:23.320 --> 07:26.920]  who would have a problem if I switched from MP3 to AAC
[07:26.920 --> 07:30.000]  if that was more than 1%.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.320]  Well, we could certainly try it.
[07:31.320 --> 07:33.040]  What's the point?
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.920]  I kind of feel like MP3 is the one that's also
[07:36.920 --> 07:39.640]  going to be most likely to be listened
[07:39.640 --> 07:42.560]  and listenable to 100 years from now.
[07:42.560 --> 07:44.320]  Well, MP3 is like its own brand.
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.560]  People know what an MP3 is.
[07:45.560 --> 07:49.320]  Even non-computer people know what an MP3 is.
[07:49.320 --> 07:52.720]  Yeah, AAC might have some technical improvements
[07:52.720 --> 07:56.160]  where at the same, and this uses sort of stupid thing,
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.560]  we used to argue about 10 years ago
[07:57.560 --> 07:59.440]  where at the same bit rate,
[07:59.440 --> 08:02.440]  you can fit a couple, 20% more songs.
[08:02.440 --> 08:05.400]  But now it's like nobody cares about that.
[08:05.400 --> 08:07.320]  Like that was like the whole point was that
[08:07.320 --> 08:10.880]  at a certain point when iPod switched from MP3 to AR
[08:10.880 --> 08:14.880]  or added AAC support, and the iTunes store was using AAC,
[08:14.880 --> 08:18.160]  they went from like five gigabytes
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.280]  was what you needed for a thousand songs to four gigabytes
[08:21.280 --> 08:25.440]  because the same quality by somebody's clearly
[08:25.440 --> 08:29.840]  subjective measurement, you can have the same quality
[08:29.840 --> 08:33.240]  of audio and save 20% on storage.
[08:33.240 --> 08:34.560]  It might matter a little bit more
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.320]  because a podcast is a lot longer than a song
[08:38.320 --> 08:39.520]  and people are downloading these things
[08:39.520 --> 08:41.440]  nowadays mostly over the air.
[08:41.440 --> 08:44.240]  And people want to, in a lot of cases,
[08:44.240 --> 08:46.440]  download them over cellular.
[08:46.440 --> 08:49.920]  It's like all the podcast clients have to negotiate
[08:49.920 --> 08:56.440]  a sort of tricky set of preferences and manual controls
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.640]  so that you're not downloading over cellular
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.160]  without knowing that you're doing it
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.760]  because you could blow right through a data cap easily.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.640]  And that would be a rude awakening
[09:06.640 --> 09:08.200]  to find out that you've run out of data
[09:08.200 --> 09:10.720]  and it's all over cast fall.
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.640]  And you go overseas or something like that
[09:13.640 --> 09:17.000]  and the data cap might be expensive and be very small,
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.400]  like 50 bucks for 250 megabytes.
[09:19.400 --> 09:22.800]  Well, that might be the whole one episode of the show
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.080]  might be 250 megabytes.
[09:25.080 --> 09:27.760]  Yeah, that would kill me every time.
[09:27.760 --> 09:29.040]  But you want to enable it
[09:29.040 --> 09:30.240]  because some people do want that.
[09:30.240 --> 09:32.800]  Some people might have, if you have an eight gigabyte
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.200]  Verizon monthly plan, you might want to download your,
[09:37.200 --> 09:39.000]  you know, you really might,
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.440]  there are some people who really do want the iPhone
[09:41.440 --> 09:44.680]  to just treat Wi-Fi and cellular identically.
[09:44.680 --> 09:46.640]  Yeah, I've never, when I'm at home,
[09:46.640 --> 09:48.920]  come anywhere near hitting the cap on my data plan.
[09:48.920 --> 09:52.400]  But when I travel, I've got Verizon
[09:52.400 --> 09:55.480]  and it does that thing after a 100 megs
[09:55.480 --> 09:57.680]  or something like that or one guy forget what it is.
[09:57.680 --> 10:00.080]  It charges you another $25.
[10:00.080 --> 10:02.280]  And I just, if I'm gone for two weeks,
[10:02.280 --> 10:05.120]  I've spent like $200, $300 on data.
[10:05.120 --> 10:07.360]  Yeah, I've spent a lot when I travel.
[10:09.360 --> 10:11.760]  Although I don't think I spent that much when I was in Ireland.
[10:13.120 --> 10:14.800]  Well, because we were at the hotel the whole time
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.120]  and there was always Wi-Fi.
[10:16.120 --> 10:17.280]  Yeah, maybe that was it.
[10:18.360 --> 10:19.800]  Although now that I mentioned this to you
[10:19.800 --> 10:21.480]  and now I'm making a note to myself,
[10:21.480 --> 10:25.240]  I don't think I did the thing I was supposed to do,
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.240]  which was, and I do this every time,
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.160]  is I go to Verizon before I go over out of the country
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.160]  and I add to my plan the 250 megabytes
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.040]  for 20 bucks thing for international data.
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.480]  But then you're like a month later when your next bill comes,
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.480]  you've got to go on and turn it off.
[10:46.480 --> 10:48.240]  Otherwise you're paying for it every month.
[10:48.240 --> 10:51.320]  Yeah, and I may or may not have just paid for it in managing.
[10:51.320 --> 10:53.720]  I just got my bill a few days ago
[10:53.720 --> 10:56.400]  and I saw that it was still on there from April
[10:56.400 --> 10:58.120]  or whenever we were there.
[10:58.120 --> 10:59.360]  Damn.
[10:59.360 --> 11:00.960]  Cause it's funny cause you're used to,
[11:00.960 --> 11:03.120]  I know last year at all I did the thing,
[11:03.120 --> 11:05.520]  you ever do the thing where you get the temporary SIM card?
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.760]  Cause you go to the Amsterdam too, right?
[11:09.760 --> 11:10.960]  What are you doing over there?
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.720]  Do you do the SIM card thing or do you just pay Verizon?
[11:13.720 --> 11:17.000]  When I was living there, what I did was I went to the T-Mobile store
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.520]  and it's like 10 euros or something for one gig of data
[11:21.520 --> 11:23.600]  and that ends up being pretty cheap.
[11:23.600 --> 11:25.880]  And you can run on a gig for about a month
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.840]  of just normal daily, like checking Twitter and stuff like that.
[11:29.840 --> 11:32.880]  So I just, I used a T-Mobile SIM when I was over there
[11:32.880 --> 11:34.560]  for a longer term.
[11:34.560 --> 11:35.800]  If it's just gonna be a week or something,
[11:35.800 --> 11:39.800]  I'll stick with Verizon and deal with the ridiculous data charges.
[11:39.800 --> 11:43.440]  And I messaged, the way that I messaged bridges SMS though
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.360]  is it gets screwy when you change your phone number
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.320]  with, which is implicit with putting a temporary SIM card in.
[11:51.320 --> 11:54.000]  Right, suddenly those messages that should be going to your phone
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.200]  number are now going, who knows where?
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.320]  Right, and you might be sending messages from a phone number
[12:00.320 --> 12:03.160]  that you don't want people to ever send to again in the future.
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.160]  And you can, there's, you know, you can usually,
[12:07.160 --> 12:09.920]  usually when I'm sending to somebody who I know has I messaged,
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.320]  I prefer to send address it to their email address
[12:13.320 --> 12:15.000]  rather than their phone number.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.040]  Cause I feel like it's more permanent.
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.560]  But I don't know, I just remember that the year before
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.000]  at all, I ran into all sorts of, it was great price wise.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.480]  Getting a temporary SIM card, it was like more data
[12:27.480 --> 12:28.920]  than I could use while I was in Ireland
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.680]  for a very, very reasonable price.
[12:30.680 --> 12:34.240]  But it was very confusing, I messaged wise.
[12:34.240 --> 12:35.440]  It's a, it's a big hassle.
[12:35.440 --> 12:37.360]  My, when I was living over in Amsterdam,
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.320]  my, my nightly ritual, my routine was that when I get home,
[12:41.320 --> 12:44.200]  I would pop the SIM out, put my old SIM in
[12:44.200 --> 12:46.840]  and give it five minutes to see if any messages came in
[12:46.840 --> 12:49.000]  or if I got any voicemails and then swap them back.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.800]  I don't, I don't know what to suggest to Apple
[12:50.800 --> 12:52.400]  because it's such a weird edge case.
[12:52.400 --> 12:53.760]  And I don't want to suggest,
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.680]  but I want somehow to be able to tell the iPhone,
[12:56.680 --> 12:58.960]  use this SIM card only for data.
[13:00.160 --> 13:01.760]  You know, and then just keep using my number.
[13:01.760 --> 13:04.240]  Yeah, like, like this is not a phone number,
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.080]  just use this SIM card for data.
[13:06.080 --> 13:09.840]  Like it's, it's somehow, that's the edge case
[13:09.840 --> 13:12.360]  where the way that we as a technical culture
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.840]  have conflated the legacy telephone network
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.080]  where you have this unique, worldwide, unique phone number
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.680]  with just give me internet, which is really all I want.
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.200]  I have no desire whatsoever, zero ever to use
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.520]  the actual phone or text messaging with a temporary SIM card.
[13:33.520 --> 13:35.880]  All I want is IP networking.
[13:35.880 --> 13:38.120]  And there's, but there's no way to tell the iPhone that.
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.760]  It seems like, I don't know if this is iOS 7, iOS 8,
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.560]  but lately, when I, when I have to do something like that,
[13:44.560 --> 13:47.680]  it still says my phone number.
[13:47.680 --> 13:49.400]  So I don't know if maybe they've changed it
[13:49.400 --> 13:50.840]  to where the phone number can linger
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.040]  even if you get rid of your sit.
[13:52.040 --> 13:53.760]  How does it work with the iPad?
[13:53.760 --> 13:56.800]  When you have a cellular iPad, you do have a phone number.
[13:56.800 --> 13:59.360]  Like it says it like when you go into your settings
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.440]  to deal with, you know, whichever carrier it is that you have.
[14:02.440 --> 14:05.440]  It tells you a phone, yeah, your SIM card for an iPad
[14:05.440 --> 14:08.280]  has a phone number, but I don't think you can ever
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.720]  receive text messages at that number.
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.760]  No.
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.240]  I can't imagine, that's probably just like a, like a,
[14:16.240 --> 14:18.280]  I don't know, a function of it being a SIM card.
[14:18.280 --> 14:20.520]  So I guess, I don't know, I guess it's not that confusing.
[14:20.520 --> 14:23.400]  I guess so I guess what I want is a way to tell an iPhone
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.040]  to go into iPad mode and treat this, use this SIM card only
[14:28.040 --> 14:30.280]  for data.
[14:30.280 --> 14:32.600]  There's also an argument to be made for,
[14:32.600 --> 14:34.160]  give me two SIM slots.
[14:34.160 --> 14:36.320]  Yeah, but that's confusing though, because I don't want
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.120]  people sending me text messages while I'm out of the country.
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.200]  You know, it's because it's, I don't know, it's not that much
[14:42.200 --> 14:44.800]  money, but it's, you know, I know it's annoying if somebody
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.880]  who actually has like an Android phone sends you a text
[14:46.880 --> 14:48.040]  because I don't know you're out of the country
[14:48.040 --> 14:50.320]  and you paid $2 just to receive it.
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.400]  Let's see if you get for talking to those people anyway.
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.160]  Anyway, back to the meta talk about the show.
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.320]  So one reason I've never come up, you know, that you're now
[15:00.320 --> 15:04.840]  selling the show, the sponsorships for this show and your show
[15:04.840 --> 15:10.400]  and Brents and Chris Parris' show, I've never really had
[15:10.400 --> 15:12.800]  reason to bring it up is that this show's sponsorships have
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.000]  been sold out for a while and they're still sold out.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.600]  I think they're like, we're recording right now on June 30
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.880]  and they're sold out through August, right?
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.240]  Yeah, and there's nothing open in the last week of August.
[15:25.240 --> 15:27.920]  So there's been no reason to publicize it,
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.360]  but for anybody who's curious, if you're out there, you listen,
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.520]  I've never had to bring this up before because it's like the
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.200]  show's, you know, been lucky enough that it's been sold out
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.560]  and we have so many repeat sponsors who keep buying up spots,
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.680]  but anybody who's ever been curious, if you have like a product
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.480]  or something and you thought, maybe I should sponsor the talk show,
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.640]  you can go to standard, whether we're calling it, standard.fm
[15:52.640 --> 15:53.960]  is the website.
[15:53.960 --> 15:57.000]  Yeah, go to standard.fm and go from there
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.240]  and then you can figure out how to sponsor the show.
[15:59.240 --> 16:02.120]  Yeah, it's pretty much just ends with people emailing me.
[16:02.120 --> 16:03.760]  Not a podcast network.
[16:03.760 --> 16:06.200]  No, no, we were very careful about that.
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.360]  There's so much discussion going into this about how can we do
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.480]  this without being another podcast now, right?
[16:12.480 --> 16:17.000]  It's just a way to, it's like the one aspect of a podcast network
[16:17.000 --> 16:24.160]  that we wanted, which is that it's a way less work for one person
[16:24.160 --> 16:27.240]  to sell sponsorships from multiple shows than it is for each show
[16:27.240 --> 16:30.240]  to book their own sponsorships.
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.360]  But really what it came down to is I realized with me having to sell my own
[16:33.360 --> 16:36.040]  spots for unprofessional, it just made sense.
[16:36.040 --> 16:41.760]  And you were going to be leaving mule and everybody had this, this one problem.
[16:41.760 --> 16:44.120]  Like all of us that are part of the same, we all had the same problem.
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.320]  It's like, well, you know what, if I'm doing it for mine, it would be easier.
[16:47.320 --> 16:50.880]  It probably would be easier if I, if I could go to sponsors and say, well,
[16:50.880 --> 16:54.960]  you know, we're, we're a group and maybe we could make other things happen.
[16:54.960 --> 16:56.480]  Yeah, it's just a lot, I don't know.
[16:56.480 --> 17:01.360]  It's one of those things where a little bit of collectivism saves a lot of work.
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.680]  Yeah, and I mean, there's a, a sort of tangible benefit to Cube Ranch too,
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.120]  where I, if, if Brent is working on code and not worrying about how he's
[17:10.120 --> 17:15.520]  going to sell sponsorship for his podcaster, his website, then that's an upside for us.
[17:15.520 --> 17:18.120]  I never thought of that.
[17:18.120 --> 17:22.560]  I mean, take that moment and thank our first sponsor.
[17:22.560 --> 17:27.440]  It's a good friends, speaking of repeat sponsors are good friends at Warby Parker.
[17:27.440 --> 17:32.680]  Warby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective to create
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.760]  boutique quality, classically crafted eyewear at a revolutionary price point.
[17:37.760 --> 17:38.440]  That's what they said.
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.880]  I say, go to Warby Parker and you can get really cool eyeglasses at way less
[17:42.880 --> 17:49.680]  than what you would pay at most retail eye boutique places.
[17:49.680 --> 17:53.080]  And at the cheap eye boutique places, you're not going to get glasses that look as cool
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.200]  as Warby Parker's.
[17:57.200 --> 17:58.360]  It's that simple, really.
[17:58.360 --> 18:00.840]  They should not cost as much as an iPhone.
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.360]  Prescription glasses at Warby Parker started 95 bucks, including the prescription lenses.
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.560]  They have a titanium collection that starts at 145.
[18:09.560 --> 18:13.600]  Now if you've gone shopping for eyeglasses recently, you know those prices are way, way less
[18:13.600 --> 18:15.240]  than that.
[18:15.240 --> 18:19.560]  They don't jerk you around with upsells on all the stuff you'd want anyway, like anti
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.520]  reflective, anti-glare coding, that just comes because who doesn't want that?
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.680]  Who wants glare and reflections on their glasses?
[18:27.680 --> 18:30.760]  Can I have the easily scratched lenses for you?
[18:30.760 --> 18:33.960]  Give me the glasses that are made out of that plastic that they made the first iPad
[18:33.960 --> 18:35.680]  Nano's out of it.
[18:35.680 --> 18:37.640]  Where if you look at it, funny, they get scratched.
[18:37.640 --> 18:38.640]  No, of course not.
[18:38.640 --> 18:42.000]  You want all the good stuff.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  And this is the thing.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.960]  And you guys have heard this before, but it really works.
[18:45.960 --> 18:48.880]  You think, well, wait, I do care about what my glasses look like.
[18:48.880 --> 18:49.880]  I care.
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.360]  Because they're going to be right on my face.
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.080]  I don't know how can I buy these things over the internet and get a pair of glasses that
[18:56.080 --> 18:57.440]  are going to look good on me.
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.600]  Because you might see a pair on the web page, think, well that looks cool, but you don't
[19:01.600 --> 19:02.600]  know if it looks good on you.
[19:02.600 --> 19:03.920]  Well, they've got a couple of things.
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.280]  They've got like a webcam type thing where you can, and it works pretty amazingly well,
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.600]  where you just snap a picture of yourself in front of the webcam and then they measure
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.440]  the stuff like your nose and your eye distance.
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.960]  You pick a pair of glasses and they like, you know, impose them over your face.
[19:22.960 --> 19:26.240]  But the other thing to have, and this is the bigger deal, is that they have this try-at-home
[19:26.240 --> 19:27.240]  thing.
[19:27.240 --> 19:30.320]  You pick five pairs that you like.
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.200]  They send them to you without the prescription lens or anything.
[19:34.200 --> 19:36.360]  You get a nice little box, open it up.
[19:36.360 --> 19:37.360]  There they are.
[19:37.360 --> 19:38.360]  There's your five glasses.
[19:38.360 --> 19:42.000]  You can take them out, try them on, compare them against each other.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.240]  Already with a label to ship it right back to them.
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.360]  If you like one of them, you can just order right there, say, this is the one I like,
[19:47.360 --> 19:48.880]  give me this one, then they send it to you.
[19:48.880 --> 19:53.480]  You put the five samples back in, box it up, there's already a label, send it right
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.480]  back to them.
[19:54.480 --> 19:56.040]  Couldn't be easier.
[19:56.040 --> 19:57.040]  We just did it here.
[19:57.040 --> 20:00.920]  My wife just got a pair of sunglasses from Warby Parker.
[20:00.920 --> 20:04.080]  Everything it was exactly as described.
[20:04.080 --> 20:06.800]  She got five pairs in a box.
[20:06.800 --> 20:10.680]  She picked the one she liked the most, and like literally a couple days later, there they
[20:10.680 --> 20:12.680]  are with her prescription lenses.
[20:12.680 --> 20:14.560]  Couldn't be easier.
[20:14.560 --> 20:15.560]  Really, really happy.
[20:15.560 --> 20:19.080]  If anything she's pickier than I am about buying stuff like that, it's a pretty brilliant
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.080]  setup.
[20:20.080 --> 20:25.760]  Yeah, it really is, and I think it's no surprise that so many people, I know so many people
[20:25.760 --> 20:29.560]  who have glasses from them, and I've never heard anybody who said, boy, they kind of regret
[20:29.560 --> 20:30.560]  it.
[20:30.560 --> 20:31.600]  Everybody is really, really happy with it.
[20:31.600 --> 20:33.000]  So where do you go to find out more?
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  Easy.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.040]  Warby Parker dot com slash the talk show.
[20:37.040 --> 20:41.040]  Warby Parker dot com slash the talk show.
[20:41.040 --> 20:42.040]  Recommend them very highly.
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.040]  Go check them out.
[20:43.040 --> 20:46.120]  Do those work with Google Glass?
[20:46.120 --> 20:49.080]  You know, I don't think they do yet, but you joke.
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.720]  They were mentioned though at some point like a year ago, they were mentioned as a partner
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.800]  that was helping to purify, you know, stylize Google Glass.
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.280]  I don't know if that fell through or if it's still coming.
[21:02.280 --> 21:05.080]  Well there was though last week, I found problem to solve.
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.080]  Who was it?
[21:06.080 --> 21:12.840]  It's some fashion brand that I don't, I can't recall off the top of my head, that
[21:12.840 --> 21:21.920]  did release a bunch of designer frames for Google Glass.
[21:21.920 --> 21:28.360]  I can't remember Diane, something, Diane, oh, it's a fast and bird, yeah, something
[21:28.360 --> 21:29.360]  like that.
[21:29.360 --> 21:32.560]  It's close enough.
[21:32.560 --> 21:38.360]  And you know, they just look really, really like Google Glass.
[21:38.360 --> 21:39.360]  Everything wrong.
[21:39.360 --> 21:40.360]  There's nothing you can do about that.
[21:40.360 --> 21:46.200]  I mean, when you have like a two inch by one inch battery pack behind your right ear,
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.600]  you know, there's just not much you can do with it.
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.920]  It looks like you're wearing Google Glass or you have a hearing problem, I guess.
[21:53.920 --> 21:57.520]  I would argue that I hope that Google Glass always looks like Google Glass so I can spot
[21:57.520 --> 21:59.560]  it.
[21:59.560 --> 22:01.840]  You know what, it's a complicated thing.
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.440]  I've talked about this with people on the show before where let's face it though, that's
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.120]  not going to happen, right?
[22:09.120 --> 22:16.160]  Just in terms of being a technical demo, Google Glass is, you know, in the grand scheme
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.520]  of technology, it is, you know, it's amazing.
[22:18.520 --> 22:21.680]  It's like jet, you know, jet packs and flying cars, it's something you've always thought
[22:21.680 --> 22:27.920]  about as a kid as you could put the heads up display in front of your eyes in real life.
[22:27.920 --> 22:32.480]  And it's, you know, in the grand scheme of things pretty small, in real world practical
[22:32.480 --> 22:36.080]  use, it's nowhere near small enough to be noticeable.
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.680]  But if that's where we are today in 2014 or where we were in 2012, I guess, when Glass
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.200]  came out, you know, I don't think it's going to be shocking if 10 years from now you
[22:45.200 --> 22:51.080]  can make a pair of Google Glass that doesn't look different from a pair of regular eye glasses.
[22:51.080 --> 22:56.560]  Well, I'm sure, you know, I mean, look at how much smaller cameras have gotten.
[22:56.560 --> 23:03.200]  I mean, the camera seems like it's probably the easier part to make indistinguishable, to
[23:03.200 --> 23:06.360]  somehow hide in the frame of the glasses.
[23:06.360 --> 23:10.840]  Yeah, I think really it comes down to the battery, because even the heads of the display
[23:10.840 --> 23:17.040]  part, there's other things they can do to either build that into your eye glass lens
[23:17.040 --> 23:22.320]  or I build it into the frame, so like what they do in cars for the, for the HUD, yeah,
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.320]  like a weird projection, something.
[23:24.320 --> 23:29.680]  Yeah, I agree that battery is probably a bigger, a bigger challenge.
[23:29.680 --> 23:33.680]  In the display part, I don't know, somehow they'll figure out a way to make it so that
[23:33.680 --> 23:39.560]  it's integrated in the lens as opposed to a weird thing sticking out over the lens.
[23:39.560 --> 23:44.880]  And you know, it's going to be a weird thing when you don't know whether people are recording
[23:44.880 --> 23:45.880]  you or not.
[23:45.880 --> 23:52.040]  I mean, I mean, I think it's a foolish to think that we're not going to have to deal
[23:52.040 --> 23:53.840]  with that in our lifetimes.
[23:53.840 --> 23:56.920]  I mean, it's clearly coming.
[23:56.920 --> 24:02.520]  Is it maybe that we're old-fuddy duddies and we came from an era before this, and it's
[24:02.520 --> 24:07.520]  going to be just like, I don't know, the CCTV camera at the gas station, where we don't
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.520]  think about that.
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.120]  We don't feel like that's an invasion of privacy.
[24:10.120 --> 24:14.120]  Maybe a kid born today, by the time they're old enough, they're never going to think of
[24:14.120 --> 24:16.120]  something like Google Glass as being invasive.
[24:16.120 --> 24:22.600]  Yeah, I think it's just those, yeah, I think it's something like that, where it just
[24:22.600 --> 24:28.440]  becomes part of the world around you and you accept, you have to accept it because you
[24:28.440 --> 24:29.440]  don't have a choice.
[24:29.440 --> 24:34.760]  You know, I think that if you went back 30 or 40 years and told people about a world
[24:34.760 --> 24:41.320]  where everybody can send and receive phone calls anywhere they are at any point, at dinner,
[24:41.320 --> 24:45.720]  in their car, anywhere, you can just always be reached.
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.960]  Your phone can ring at any time and you can always call someone at any time and you've
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.680]  got to dinner and there'll be people talking on the phone at tables near you, they would
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.080]  say that sounds, I would think that they would have a similar reaction to the way that
[24:59.080 --> 25:04.160]  like I feel about people being able to record me at any time.
[25:04.160 --> 25:05.960]  Yeah, yeah, probably.
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.120]  I think, you know, if a version of me that would have been my age now, then would probably
[25:11.120 --> 25:13.560]  have an anxiety attack at the thought of that.
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.720]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's unappealing and I say, but I'm a person who thinks it's relatively
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.960]  unappealing to get phone calls at any time, you know, I mean, I tend to not answer my
[25:22.960 --> 25:23.880]  phone usually.
[25:23.880 --> 25:27.760]  So, and I don't get that many phone calls period anyway.
[25:27.760 --> 25:30.080]  Yeah, you're not a, you know, a phone person.
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.080]  No, not really.
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.080]  And even someone who I want to talk to like, my dad calls me and I like to talk to my
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.040]  dad a couple of times a week and talk about baseball or whatever, but if I'm like out,
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.680]  if I'm like, you know, waiting in line at the supermarket to pay and my dad calls me,
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.400]  I'll just, you know, send it right to voicemail and call them when I get home.
[25:47.400 --> 25:51.440]  Like it drives, I think it's crazy when people do things like pick up the phone when, you
[25:51.440 --> 25:57.080]  know, for, for something that's not immediate, you know, like if, you know, you're, if you
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.520]  get a call from your kid's school, well, you want to answer that right away because who knows,
[26:00.520 --> 26:03.840]  maybe it's an emergency, but if it's, you know, just my dad calling, I mean, why would
[26:03.840 --> 26:06.280]  I do take that phone call in the supermarket?
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.240]  It's when it kills me is the people who will answer the phone when they're in the passenger
[26:10.240 --> 26:11.240]  seat of a car.
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.720]  I don't know if I've ever seen that.
[26:13.720 --> 26:15.480]  Oh, it's, it's just rude.
[26:15.480 --> 26:18.680]  Because if you're the driver, you're, you're now trapped in a situation where you're,
[26:18.680 --> 26:21.560]  you're somebody you show for and you're listening to one half of a conversation.
[26:21.560 --> 26:22.800]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[26:22.800 --> 26:23.800]  Yeah, that does weird.
[26:23.800 --> 26:29.280]  Yeah, or like, you know, people are out to, you know, it's like a table for four at, at
[26:29.280 --> 26:33.240]  an restaurant and somebody just answers like a random phone call and starts talking.
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.880]  It just seems very strange to me.
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.160]  Yeah, but you, you'll, you'll watch a baseball game at dinner.
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.040]  Yeah, but I don't turn the volume on.
[26:43.040 --> 26:46.040]  You don't, you don't think that there's a similar sort of thing happening there where
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.720]  there's, I don't know, there's the, the rudeness of causing noise to disturb other people.
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.560]  And then there's the, uh, how, how engaged are you with the people around you?
[26:54.560 --> 26:55.560]  Yeah.
[26:55.560 --> 26:56.560]  I sound like I'm criticizing you.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.920]  Well, no, it's point taken, you know, it's probably not, not the most polite thing that
[27:00.920 --> 27:01.920]  I do.
[27:01.920 --> 27:03.280]  I don't do it all the time.
[27:03.280 --> 27:06.960]  No, no, but I don't think it's really that different from somebody checking Twitter at
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.800]  the table or whatever it's, it's, it's, it's, it's all on a spectrum though.
[27:11.800 --> 27:16.600]  And then away and, and if you went back and talked about it, you know, go back 20, 30 years,
[27:16.600 --> 27:24.120]  it all seems pretty rude and, uh, you know, that the devices are, are drawing more attention
[27:24.120 --> 27:26.720]  than, than other people around us.
[27:26.720 --> 27:30.400]  I think the, the baseball thing, it's a comical example of something that we all do.
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.840]  Well, I'll check our phone, even if it's just of my, my phone buzzed in my pocket and
[27:34.840 --> 27:38.640]  I'll excuse myself for a second, even at my most polite, I'm still ignoring somebody
[27:38.640 --> 27:40.040]  for a minute while I look at my phone.
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.160]  Yeah, and we're all a little hypocritical about it where the things that we love most
[27:44.160 --> 27:48.120]  about what our phones let us do, we think are okay and the things we don't care about
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.120]  are rude.
[27:49.120 --> 27:50.200]  So I don't like talking on the phone.
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.280]  I don't get many phone calls.
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.040]  So I'll blather on about how rude it is that people will talk on the phone.
[27:55.040 --> 27:56.840]  But I love watching the Yankees.
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.640]  And so, you know, I think being able to watch a Yankees game while I dinner is, is amazing
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.040]  technology.
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.560]  So I admit that, but I admit I have the self awareness to admit that I'm, I'm being a
[28:06.560 --> 28:09.080]  hypocrite to, to present it that way.
[28:09.080 --> 28:14.280]  I wish that Verizon would give me a zero minutes plan or like a 30 minutes plan.
[28:14.280 --> 28:16.320]  I use about 30 phone minutes a month.
[28:16.320 --> 28:17.680]  I would happily pay less.
[28:17.680 --> 28:18.840]  I don't even know what we use.
[28:18.840 --> 28:22.240]  I guess we use a lot because we have like a shared pool and Amy speaks on the phone a
[28:22.240 --> 28:23.240]  little bit more than me.
[28:23.240 --> 28:26.760]  But we, I don't think we come even close to using all the minutes.
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.160]  I think that the, we're at the point, even though, even if Amy uses her phone a lot more
[28:31.160 --> 28:36.120]  than me, we're not even close to using any, you know, what they give us.
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.480]  It's crazy that they still measure by minute.
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.480]  Yeah.
[28:39.480 --> 28:40.480]  Like AOL.
[28:40.480 --> 28:41.480]  Yeah.
[28:41.480 --> 28:43.680]  I mean, does anybody, does there anybody who needs like extra minutes?
[28:43.680 --> 28:47.160]  I guess there's some people who have a job that they're really truly on the phone all
[28:47.160 --> 28:48.160]  the time.
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.560]  You know, I would have met, you know, like real estate agents or something like that,
[28:50.560 --> 28:56.440]  you know, that some jobs really are on your cell phone making phone calls all day every
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.440]  day.
[28:57.440 --> 28:58.440]  But I don't know.
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.880]  Do they, do they have to pay extra for that?
[28:59.880 --> 29:02.800]  It just seems like that's, everybody has unlimited plans now.
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.240]  And it seems like some people have the, like it's, you know, $100 just for the phone
[29:07.240 --> 29:13.840]  part of it or something, but you get effectively or literally unlimited talk time, why not
[29:13.840 --> 29:15.240]  make that the standard?
[29:15.240 --> 29:16.840]  I don't know.
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.200]  Maybe it's just a, like a, a holdover from the fact that they're kind of, they're in,
[29:21.200 --> 29:24.240]  they're moving into just being a dumb carrier at this point.
[29:24.240 --> 29:28.240]  Speaking of, of rude and callous behavior, just see this thing, it had to have seen it.
[29:28.240 --> 29:34.880]  The, the, came out over the weekend that Facebook had been running a psychological experiment
[29:34.880 --> 29:42.360]  where they, they took a 600,000 or 700,000 users and half of them, they randomly tried
[29:42.360 --> 29:46.040]  to algorithmically make their feed a little happier.
[29:46.040 --> 29:51.520]  And the other half, they tried to make it a little sadder and then tried to measure with
[29:51.520 --> 29:58.640]  like certain keywords, like for the remainder of the week, where the things that those
[29:58.640 --> 30:03.840]  people, those two pools posted, a little did indicate that they were in better or worse
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.680]  moods and the answer was yes, that, that it actually did seem to have some sort of effect
[30:08.680 --> 30:14.040]  on their mood, that the people whose feed was dittled to make them happier seem to be happier
[30:14.040 --> 30:18.360]  and the ones who were dittled to.
[30:18.360 --> 30:26.680]  Well, and I, I mean, essentially, and I got some feedback on Twitter and, and email from
[30:26.680 --> 30:32.080]  people saying that it's, it's not helpful for me to say, I, my, my, the, just in my
[30:32.080 --> 30:36.160]  responses, I'm surprised that people are surprised and I'm with you on that.
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.760]  Because this is what Facebook does.
[30:37.760 --> 30:42.920]  So for example, compare contrast to if the same thing had been announced about Twitter.
[30:42.920 --> 30:47.160]  Now Twitter is a screwy company and I don't quite get their strategy.
[30:47.160 --> 30:51.200]  I think that the people who run Twitter are not very good at Twitter or they're not very
[30:51.200 --> 30:53.640]  good at seeing what Twitter is good for.
[30:53.640 --> 30:57.440]  But if this had come out about Twitter, I would have been, I would have been surprised
[30:57.440 --> 31:00.800]  because this doesn't sound like something Twitter would do.
[31:00.800 --> 31:03.440]  And I would have been surprised and I think I would have been appalled.
[31:03.440 --> 31:08.120]  I would, you know, I would, but it would seem out of character for Twitter incorporated
[31:08.120 --> 31:10.280]  to do something like this.
[31:10.280 --> 31:13.680]  Um, where at that, that to me is my point.
[31:13.680 --> 31:18.080]  My point isn't to be so cynical as to assume that all companies are doing stuff like that
[31:18.080 --> 31:22.040]  and that nobody should be outraged about Facebook here because this is what they do.
[31:22.040 --> 31:23.640]  What I'm saying is open your eyes.
[31:23.640 --> 31:25.760]  This is what Facebook does time and time again.
[31:25.760 --> 31:28.920]  And I think that's an important distinction.
[31:28.920 --> 31:34.280]  I think that Twitter, it would not surprise me if we found out they were doing things
[31:34.280 --> 31:38.760]  with your, not with your stream, but evaluating your stream for advertising.
[31:38.760 --> 31:39.760]  They might even do that now.
[31:39.760 --> 31:45.000]  I don't know, but anything, anything about like in a googly sort of way, looking at your
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.200]  stuff and then using that to decide what other stuff they show you, I'd buy that and
[31:49.200 --> 31:54.000]  I don't even know that I'd be offended by that, but trying to manipulate me emotionally.
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.680]  I don't know though, maybe.
[31:55.680 --> 31:59.880]  And that people, you know, I don't want to be too callous about it and I think it clearly
[31:59.880 --> 32:05.720]  shows it, it makes Facebook as a corporation come across as incredibly callous.
[32:05.720 --> 32:12.000]  It's really, I mean, it, it no doubt about it, but some people, it sounds like you're
[32:12.000 --> 32:17.920]  one of them really feel like anything related to attempting to manipulate people's emotions
[32:17.920 --> 32:22.760]  is just crossing a sort of ethical line that, that just should not be crossed.
[32:22.760 --> 32:29.080]  Because I would say, isn't every advertisement an attempt to manipulate people emotionally?
[32:29.080 --> 32:34.040]  I agree with that and I would say that it's not the, it's not that they're trying to
[32:34.040 --> 32:35.360]  manipulate me emotionally.
[32:35.360 --> 32:40.320]  It's that they're willing to manipulate me emotionally in a negative way.
[32:40.320 --> 32:43.680]  If they're, if they're altering my timeline to try to make me happier and it works great.
[32:43.680 --> 32:47.480]  If they're altering my timeline to try to make me sad, that's not okay.
[32:47.480 --> 32:52.680]  Yeah, but you can't do the science without having like a control group, right?
[32:52.680 --> 32:55.520]  Yeah, I'm not trying to defend it.
[32:55.520 --> 32:59.920]  I'm just saying I can kind of see their perspective if you were going to be sick bastards.
[32:59.920 --> 33:05.120]  See, to me, the part that's offensive is, is, is not that they tried to make some sad
[33:05.120 --> 33:10.760]  and some happy, it's, I, because I don't think that they tried to make people suicidal.
[33:10.760 --> 33:12.320]  I haven't read enough details to see.
[33:12.320 --> 33:17.280]  I would like to, I'd be curious to see, like if you were in one of the two groups, what
[33:17.280 --> 33:22.160]  the difference would be, like here's what your example users' feed would have looked
[33:22.160 --> 33:25.440]  like if they weren't chosen for it at all.
[33:25.440 --> 33:29.360]  Well, they probably, probably do things like if you're, if you're single, they're going
[33:29.360 --> 33:34.920]  to show you lots of posts of people getting married and, and having babies and stuff.
[33:34.920 --> 33:36.720]  Try to make you feel bad.
[33:36.720 --> 33:37.720]  That'd be my guess.
[33:37.720 --> 33:38.720]  Right.
[33:38.720 --> 33:41.560]  Like things are not in a relationship, emphasize other people's relationships or something.
[33:41.560 --> 33:42.560]  Exactly.
[33:42.560 --> 33:43.560]  Right.
[33:43.560 --> 33:44.560]  Exactly.
[33:44.560 --> 33:48.240]  But I'm curious, I haven't seen a lot of details about exactly how they did the manipulation.
[33:48.240 --> 33:51.360]  Well, the, the, the guy who did it just wrote a response.
[33:51.360 --> 33:52.360]  I haven't read it yet.
[33:52.360 --> 33:53.600]  But apparently, I mean, he's going on record.
[33:53.600 --> 33:56.480]  He's saying, here's, here's why we did what we did.
[33:56.480 --> 34:02.720]  It's just, it, there's a certain tone deafness to them that they, that they seem to be surprised
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.160]  that, that people are reacting this way.
[34:06.160 --> 34:13.680]  Because it's not like this was a secret internal project that, that a whistle blower leaked.
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.240]  It's, it's a paper they published in a real scientific journal, you know, they published it.
[34:18.240 --> 34:21.560]  They were, they're proud of the science behind it.
[34:21.560 --> 34:24.760]  You never crossed their minds that people would be grossed out by the right, that, that
[34:24.760 --> 34:27.800]  this might be something they wouldn't want to tell people that they're doing.
[34:27.800 --> 34:31.680]  Like there's obviously a very strange culture there at Facebook that it never even occurred
[34:31.680 --> 34:34.400]  to them that people might be offended by this.
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.440]  You know, I mean, A, B testing with people's mental health, that's a, it's the kind of
[34:40.440 --> 34:45.080]  thing that I don't know, may, if, if they allowed you to opt in, like here's a new program
[34:45.080 --> 34:46.080]  we're doing.
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.960]  But that's what they're saying is that every, every single user of Facebook has opted
[34:49.960 --> 34:57.120]  in, in that if you read their privacy statement that there's, you know, clearly, you know,
[34:57.120 --> 34:58.960]  there's, I, and some people have even called it out.
[34:58.960 --> 35:03.040]  There's even, you know, it, it even specifically says that, you know, that something about
[35:03.040 --> 35:05.560]  research and, you know, who reads that?
[35:05.560 --> 35:10.520]  Nobody, because it's opaque and it is, and super long and they probably show it to you
[35:10.520 --> 35:13.080]  in like six point type, but it is there.
[35:13.080 --> 35:19.000]  And that part of their argument is that everybody has, it hasn't, you know, can, can you
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.920]  imagine Apple doing something like that and saying, well, if you would have read that
[35:21.920 --> 35:25.640]  iTunes update agreement, it was all there.
[35:25.640 --> 35:32.560]  And I think that the most upsetting part to me, it's like as a designer, I think to myself,
[35:32.560 --> 35:36.320]  the way that, in part of why I think that Twitter would never do something like this is
[35:36.320 --> 35:41.440]  Twitter, you're seeing the stream and the value is in having all of that data and the
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.000]  value to you, like there's an expectation that all of the tweets are going to be there.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.480]  And Facebook's approach, you're not a, you're not a Facebook user.
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.320]  So I guess you don't get to see this, you're, you don't have to see that.
[35:51.320 --> 35:54.720]  Yeah, but I'm really anxious to sign up now.
[35:54.720 --> 35:57.360]  But they do a thing where they don't show you a timeline.
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.560]  They show you it's kind of a timeline, but they order it however they want.
[36:00.560 --> 36:01.560]  Right.
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.600]  And so when you, when you open the Facebook app on your phone, it pushes you to the top,
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.520]  it scrolls you to the top, or it leaves you in the same spot and you, with like a, sort
[36:10.520 --> 36:13.680]  of like a jaggy tap here to load more kind of a thing.
[36:13.680 --> 36:17.480]  But as you go to the top, like there's no rhyme or reason to why the things are ordered
[36:17.480 --> 36:18.480]  the way they are.
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.600]  The thing at the top isn't the newest thing, and it doesn't even seem to be the most
[36:21.600 --> 36:24.000]  important or most interesting thing.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.520]  And my guess is that the manipulation is that.
[36:26.520 --> 36:28.160]  Right.
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.400]  And maybe that they make things that they, their algorithm says, hey, this seems like something
[36:32.400 --> 36:39.080]  that's going to make Dave feel good, you know, I don't know, somebody like a friend
[36:39.080 --> 36:44.440]  who's on vacation and has taken what algorithmically looks like a happy photograph.
[36:44.440 --> 36:45.720]  This is going to make Dave feel good.
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.600]  Let's put the photograph right here at the top, you know.
[36:49.600 --> 36:50.600]  Yeah.
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.120]  And it bothers me that they would make editorial decisions about what I do and do not see.
[36:55.120 --> 36:59.920]  When I have intentionally befriended or followed all of these people, right, it suggests
[36:59.920 --> 37:02.640]  that my behavior would suggest that I want to see all of those things.
[37:02.640 --> 37:03.640]  Let me curate it.
[37:03.640 --> 37:04.640]  Yeah.
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.040]  And it does seem, and I do think, I think maybe that's the core.
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.520]  More of what's really rubbing people the wrong way here and maybe it's going to give
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.760]  this scandal some legs maybe is the fact that they tried to make people feel bad.
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.480]  You mentioned that specifically, right?
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.080]  It would be different too.
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.800]  If what they did was if they tried three different algorithms to make people feel better
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.480]  about themselves and group A, it worked, group B, it didn't group C.
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.800]  It actually had the detrimental effect and made this group feel bad.
[37:37.800 --> 37:43.520]  They didn't try to do it, but it's like, whoa, it ends up that if you only show them pictures
[37:43.520 --> 37:47.160]  of such and such that it actually makes them feel bad.
[37:47.160 --> 37:48.440]  And can you imagine the headlines?
[37:48.440 --> 37:51.560]  They'd also say Facebook can make you happier, right?
[37:51.560 --> 37:57.480]  As opposed to the fact that they set out to make people some group of people feel a little
[37:57.480 --> 37:58.480]  worse.
[37:58.480 --> 38:02.960]  Facebook intentionally wanted some part of its user base to be less happy.
[38:02.960 --> 38:09.440]  The fact that that's part of what for years has kept me from using Facebook, like even
[38:09.440 --> 38:11.520]  wanting to sign up is that I just don't get it.
[38:11.520 --> 38:18.560]  I don't get what's in the feed, whereas I especially old Twitter, like the Twitter that
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.880]  you still can mostly get through like tweet bot and third buddy clients is I know exactly
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.800]  what's going to be in my feed.
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.240]  It's the tweets from the people I've chosen to follow, ordered in the order that they've
[38:33.240 --> 38:34.240]  sent them.
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.720]  Chronological list of tweets from people who I've decided to follow.
[38:38.720 --> 38:45.920]  And I know it's in my mentioned stream, people who've typed at Gruber in the order
[38:45.920 --> 38:48.360]  that they've sent those tweets, topped about them.
[38:48.360 --> 38:51.640]  And I know exactly what that is, and I know what they're going to look like.
[38:51.640 --> 38:54.200]  And it's, there's like an integrity to it.
[38:54.200 --> 39:00.200]  Whereas to me, the Facebook, what do you call it, the feed?
[39:00.200 --> 39:09.800]  There's no integrity to it, if it's arbitrarily ordered, and I don't get it, to me it seems
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.960]  like, why would I sign up for that?
[39:13.960 --> 39:19.240]  There's like an inner, there's an inner surrequeousa in me that wants, I just want to
[39:19.240 --> 39:20.680]  know the rules, right?
[39:20.680 --> 39:23.800]  I want to know the rules for what this is going to be.
[39:23.800 --> 39:24.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:24.800 --> 39:27.120]  That's my biggest complaint as a Facebook user, right?
[39:27.120 --> 39:28.960]  Well, I mean, I guess I have other complaints.
[39:28.960 --> 39:31.160]  My biggest is that I just don't know what I'm looking at, right?
[39:31.160 --> 39:33.440]  Like my email inbox, I know exactly what it is.
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.840]  Somebody knows my email address, they've typed an email to that address and they've sent
[39:37.840 --> 39:38.840]  it.
[39:38.840 --> 39:43.200]  And then it comes in and my mail client will display those messages and chronological data
[39:43.200 --> 39:44.200]  order.
[39:44.200 --> 39:46.880]  The other thing Facebook does like that is they, they've showed you this list of people
[39:46.880 --> 39:48.320]  you may know.
[39:48.320 --> 39:51.440]  And I got to tell you like, well, one out of 200, I actually know.
[39:51.440 --> 39:53.240]  I don't know who any of these people are.
[39:53.240 --> 39:56.720]  Twitter does that for me and it's actually pretty remarkable.
[39:56.720 --> 40:00.760]  Because I, like, and I see it a lot like when I'm checking the daring fireball account
[40:00.760 --> 40:03.880]  because the daring fireball account doesn't follow anybody.
[40:03.880 --> 40:06.000]  And they'll say, hey, maybe you want to start following people.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  How about these people?
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.480]  And it'll be like Amy Gruber, Brent Simmons and, you know, I don't know John Moltz.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.480]  Yeah.
[40:14.480 --> 40:15.480]  Exactly.
[40:15.480 --> 40:17.680]  It's like, wow, that's actually pretty good.
[40:17.680 --> 40:18.680]  She get those people.
[40:18.680 --> 40:19.680]  Yeah.
[40:19.680 --> 40:20.680]  She hired those people away from Twitter.
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.680]  All right, let me take a spot here and thank our second sponsor and then we'll, we'll move
[40:25.680 --> 40:26.680]  on.
[40:26.680 --> 40:29.680]  We'll get to the real part of the show.
[40:29.680 --> 40:33.680]  I want to thank our good friends at Transporter.
[40:33.680 --> 40:35.680]  That's the company name is connected data.
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.360]  They've sponsored the show before.
[40:39.360 --> 40:40.360]  Basic idea.
[40:40.360 --> 40:42.880]  You buy a little piece of hardware from them.
[40:42.880 --> 40:44.680]  It's called a Transporter.
[40:44.680 --> 40:49.760]  You set it up on your home network, install a little bit of software on your Mac and
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.520]  all of a sudden you've got effectively your own little private Dropbox.
[40:54.520 --> 40:56.240]  Get a little folder on your Mac.
[40:56.240 --> 40:57.760]  You put files on the folder.
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.280]  They get synced to the Transporter, a little device with storage on it in your house.
[41:03.280 --> 41:05.240]  Now here's where it gets more interesting.
[41:05.240 --> 41:07.720]  It's only stored on the Transporter.
[41:07.720 --> 41:09.600]  There is no cloud storage.
[41:09.600 --> 41:17.320]  The cloud is only used for negotiating from your network to outside the network.
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.600]  In other words, bridging through your home router and stuff like that.
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.640]  The actual data storage is only written to disk on your device.
[41:25.640 --> 41:27.200]  You can buy more than one device.
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.440]  You can have one at your home, one at your office or one in two different locations and
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.720]  they'll hook them up to the same account and they'll do exactly what you think they'll do.
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.120]  They'll just sync together and they'll both be complete copies of each other.
[41:41.120 --> 41:45.880]  So you can find other Transporter users and you can do things like set up shared folders
[41:45.880 --> 41:48.200]  and say here's a folder on my Transporter.
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.440]  I'm going to share it with Dave Whiskis and now we both have access to that folder.
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.300]  We both know here's where the data is stored and stored on my Transporter and your
[41:57.300 --> 42:01.200]  Transporter because they're shared folders between us and that's it.
[42:01.200 --> 42:04.880]  Big big difference between sharing stuff in the cloud and for some people, a lot of you
[42:04.880 --> 42:07.600]  I know this, I've heard it from people who listen to the show.
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.040]  For legal reasons, a lot of people, people work in a medical industry and I'm sure other
[42:12.040 --> 42:14.600]  places where there's NDAs and stuff like that.
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.760]  You legally are not allowed to share certain data on devices where you don't have complete
[42:19.760 --> 42:21.000]  control over the device.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.880]  You can't put things on something like iCloud or Dropbox because there's legal implications
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.080]  as to where you can store the data.
[42:31.080 --> 42:32.760]  Really works great.
[42:32.760 --> 42:36.600]  Really, really different from the cloud storage application.
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.600]  So if you need that or you want it just for the privacy implications of it, even just for
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.320]  your own personal privacy.
[42:43.320 --> 42:45.720]  There's nothing else to like it on the market.
[42:45.720 --> 42:48.080]  They have two main ways to go about it.
[42:48.080 --> 42:54.960]  The regular Transporter models come with, you have your choice, 500 gigabytes, one terabyte,
[42:54.960 --> 42:57.000]  two terabyte capacities.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.280]  You can go there, use this code, TTS10, TTS, the talk show, 10, and you'll save 10% off your
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.720]  purchase of any one of those devices, up to 35 bucks.
[43:07.720 --> 43:12.880]  Go to filetransporterstore.com, filetransporterstore.com.
[43:12.880 --> 43:14.120]  And you can buy one.
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.400]  The other thing you can do, though, is you can provide your own USB drive, any USB drive,
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.320]  and you can buy, it's more of like a little puck, an adorable little thing, called
[43:24.320 --> 43:26.440]  the Transporter Sync.
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.600]  And it's the same functionality, exact same functionality.
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.720]  But you just pick your own USB hard drive, you maybe even have a USB hard drive sitting
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.560]  around your office that you could already use.
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.600]  You can save 20 bucks on one of those, because I cost a lot less, forget about percentages.
[43:43.600 --> 43:48.320]  Just save 20 bucks, use this code, TTS20.
[43:48.320 --> 43:54.560]  All orders, using those two codes, TTS10, TTS20, get free shipping.
[43:54.560 --> 43:57.600]  And the last thing, here's the last thing, are you wondering if Transporter's right
[43:57.600 --> 43:58.600]  for you?
[43:58.600 --> 44:00.920]  Here's the thing, buy one, start using it.
[44:00.920 --> 44:06.320]  And for 30 days, you have a completely risk-free satisfaction guarantee.
[44:06.320 --> 44:12.320]  So use those codes, TTS10, TTS20, go to filetransporterstore.com.
[44:12.320 --> 44:13.320]  Check it out.
[44:13.320 --> 44:17.040]  Buy the one you want, and you have 30 days, if you don't like it, to send it right back
[44:17.040 --> 44:18.680]  to them.
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.680]  My thanks to filetransporter.
[44:20.680 --> 44:25.280]  I kind of want to buy one and just stick it in a corner at an Apple store and not tell
[44:25.280 --> 44:26.280]  anybody.
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.280]  Is that the most of my data for me?
[44:29.280 --> 44:30.920]  One day, how long, how long that would last?
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.080]  I bet not long.
[44:32.080 --> 44:37.120]  I bet that there's a sort of, I bet it wouldn't last bit, best the end of the day.
[44:37.120 --> 44:38.680]  They've got to, I'm sure they do a sweep.
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.680]  Yeah, because they have to clean up all the machines in a nonstop basis.
[44:42.680 --> 44:48.000]  I mean, I think that there's a checklist procedure they go through to make each one like
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.400]  store closes at seven by eight o'clock, it's back in mint condition.
[44:52.400 --> 44:55.920]  Do you think that when they close down an Apple store before they open up the Apple store?
[44:55.920 --> 44:59.360]  I mean, like permanently, but like in the morning and the evening, do you think they wipe
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.000]  down the devices?
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  Yeah.
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  I mean, physically, I do.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  I'm almost certain of it.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.920]  They clean off the fingerprints for the day and whatever gunk was done.
[45:07.920 --> 45:10.040]  I think they do it throughout the day.
[45:10.040 --> 45:11.040]  That would be better.
[45:11.040 --> 45:12.040]  I've never seen them do it.
[45:12.040 --> 45:16.280]  Well, I think that's part of the magic, you know, it's like they've got like a Disney world,
[45:16.280 --> 45:21.040]  they've got like things where like the, instead of like hauling the trash around the park,
[45:21.040 --> 45:24.680]  they just like suck them through holes in the floor that go into the underground tunnels
[45:24.680 --> 45:26.880]  so that you don't have to see the trash being hauled out.
[45:26.880 --> 45:28.280]  That's a nice touch.
[45:28.280 --> 45:29.280]  Yeah.
[45:29.280 --> 45:35.120]  The main reason I actually wanted you on the show is the one big thing from WWDC that's
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.840]  left on my things I want to talk or write about that I haven't talked or written about
[45:39.840 --> 45:46.000]  is Yosemite and the new design of Yosemite and, you know, I thought to have you on the
[45:46.000 --> 45:54.000]  show because you and I are in fact collaborating working on a Mac app this summer.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.160]  So we're sort of right in the middle of it.
[45:57.160 --> 46:03.960]  Now what are we're almost a month, a month out, right, or four weeks since from WWDC?
[46:03.960 --> 46:04.960]  Yeah.
[46:04.960 --> 46:05.960]  Yeah.
[46:05.960 --> 46:06.960]  Yeah.
[46:06.960 --> 46:07.960]  All right.
[46:07.960 --> 46:08.960]  Cause it was the second.
[46:08.960 --> 46:09.960]  So it's four weeks.
[46:09.960 --> 46:10.960]  Yeah.
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.960]  I better get moving.
[46:12.960 --> 46:16.960]  Are you, what are you using Yosemite daily?
[46:16.960 --> 46:20.440]  No, I tried and there is, I don't know some kind of bug with the upgrades.
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.680]  I've got, I have a second partition setup that's running a clean install of Yosemite
[46:24.680 --> 46:26.800]  and that was running great.
[46:26.800 --> 46:30.680]  I decided, okay, maybe, you know, all my stuff works, everything should be fine.
[46:30.680 --> 46:36.120]  I'm going to install it on my main partition and I did and it was an timer and things
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.920]  were, things were broken and I don't mean nightmare like there were some bugs and things
[46:39.920 --> 46:40.920]  crashed.
[46:40.920 --> 46:42.880]  I mean like finder wouldn't launch.
[46:42.880 --> 46:43.880]  Yeah.
[46:43.880 --> 46:50.360]  If I wanted to open a file, I had to do it through terminal and that took 45 seconds to load.
[46:50.360 --> 46:51.560]  So I kind of, I bounced back and forth.
[46:51.560 --> 46:56.280]  If I need to look at UI stuff or if I need to try to evaluate the way they're doing a thing,
[46:56.280 --> 46:57.280]  I'll switch partition.
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.200]  I'll reboot into Yosemite but for the most, like day to day, I'm still running Mavericks.
[47:01.200 --> 47:02.200]  Yeah.
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.480]  It, I got real excited about it because for a couple of days it seemed so stable that
[47:06.480 --> 47:12.600]  I thought, hey, I think I can switch full time quickly, maybe like with the next beta.
[47:12.600 --> 47:19.280]  And then I ran into a thing where I could not log into my main account that I just created.
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.680]  I could use a guest account and then from the guest account on terminal, I could like use
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.680]  pseudo with my admin account, but there was nothing I could do to log into the admin account
[47:28.680 --> 47:32.760]  and, and then it like fixed itself somehow.
[47:32.760 --> 47:35.360]  But it was scary enough that I was like, you know what, I better wait.
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.720]  But you could always do a backup and then run the upgrade for a week and if you don't
[47:40.720 --> 47:41.720]  like it, switch back.
[47:41.720 --> 47:47.040]  Yeah, I think I'll probably switch on the next beta though and at least I'll still have
[47:47.040 --> 47:53.280]  a, a machine here running my old install of Mavericks and with everything on it.
[47:53.280 --> 47:58.160]  But everything, I have so much syncs, it's so much easier to, to use multiple Macs now
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.680]  with iCloud and, and other syncing services that it's, it's not like the old days where
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.160]  it was really, really, you, you would just drive you nuts because there's, oh, I need
[48:07.160 --> 48:09.240]  that file and it's on the other machine.
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.480]  I don't know, I still can't do it.
[48:11.480 --> 48:14.880]  I can't get my head around it and that might just be that I'm too used to doing things
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.480]  the old way of running multiple machines.
[48:17.480 --> 48:20.040]  Yeah, I can't, I can't run, I have to have one Mac.
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.560]  If I have two, then I, I, yeah, iCloud and Dropbox make it better.
[48:24.560 --> 48:29.080]  But then there's like still preferences per machine that I'll forget about.
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.680]  The other thing is that I don't think it's as imperative to be using it on a daily basis
[48:34.680 --> 48:39.920]  design wise because I don't think it's that radical a design and as the, you know, it's
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.320]  a month, the, as the month has gone on, I'm happy with it almost completely.
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.040]  The parts I'm not happy with, I don't think are that big a deal.
[48:48.040 --> 48:50.600]  What, what don't you happy with?
[48:50.600 --> 48:53.120]  Well, we could, I've told you about the OK buttons.
[48:53.120 --> 48:57.640]  I don't like the, I'll, we can come back to that in a second.
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.520]  But I don't feel like it's fundamentally changed the way you design a good Mac app.
[49:01.520 --> 49:08.920]  It's a new, you know, it, it almost is only skin deep and I don't mean that as a complaint.
[49:08.920 --> 49:16.280]  I think it speaks to, you know, that they, they, if it's not broke, don't, don't fix
[49:16.280 --> 49:20.280]  it in terms of, you know, what it means to be a Mac app.
[49:20.280 --> 49:26.000]  As opposed to iOS seven, which I think was more a significantly more radical change in
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.040]  that you really needed to be using the iOS seven betas on a daily basis to get a feel
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.880]  for how an app should, should be designed for iOS seven last summer.
[49:37.880 --> 49:38.880]  Yeah.
[49:38.880 --> 49:44.680]  There's all the rumors leading up to WWDC that look, the 10, 10 is going to be a pretty
[49:44.680 --> 49:45.680]  dramatic makeover.
[49:45.680 --> 49:47.080]  It's going to be, it's very iOS seven.
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.080]  That's what we kept asking me very iOS seven.
[49:49.080 --> 49:52.000]  And when we saw it, I was taking it back at how not iOS seven it was.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Yeah.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  I agree with that.
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.960]  They look related, but they look like siblings, you know, the way that was sometimes
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.240]  you meet, you know, a brother and a sister and you're like, oh, yeah, you two kind of look
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.760]  alike, but not like in a freaky way, you know, and also playing to their own strengths.
[50:09.760 --> 50:10.760]  Yeah.
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.960]  It feels like a very measured, you know, and maybe it would have been a bigger surprise if
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.200]  there were no iOS seven, I think that iOS seven softened the blow.
[50:19.200 --> 50:20.200]  Maybe.
[50:20.200 --> 50:23.280]  But I remember you and I talking about this when we were sort of trying to guess what
[50:23.280 --> 50:24.720]  Yosemite might look like.
[50:24.720 --> 50:28.240]  And the one thing we kept looking at and in some ways it was like, oh, that would be kind
[50:28.240 --> 50:29.240]  of cool.
[50:29.240 --> 50:34.400]  But then there were in other ways we were both like gridding our teeth like, oh, this could
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.400]  be bad is the iCloud web apps, right?
[50:38.400 --> 50:44.280]  So when you go to iCloud.com on a Mac or Windows, I guess, but you get like, you know,
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.440]  you're using a mouse pointer and you're using a trackpad or a mouse in a physical keyboard.
[50:48.440 --> 50:54.160]  You're not touching the screen, but it looks really iOS 70.
[50:54.160 --> 51:00.840]  Yeah, but in a good way, in a measured way where it does, it's not, I don't know, looking
[51:00.840 --> 51:06.600]  at the web apps, the iCloud.com stuff, it felt like a sort of, I don't want to say happy
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.440]  medium, but you could, you could start to get a sense of how they would solve some of these
[51:10.440 --> 51:14.640]  like windowing problems, because on iOS, you don't, you never have two apps open at the
[51:14.640 --> 51:15.640]  same time.
[51:15.640 --> 51:18.680]  You don't have to worry about one thing sitting in front of another thing.
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.240]  Whereas on a Mac, you'll always have that problem.
[51:21.240 --> 51:24.440]  And it seemed like they were starting to hint at, well, we're still going to have shadows,
[51:24.440 --> 51:30.440]  we're still going to treat these things as individual structures on the screen.
[51:30.440 --> 51:36.520]  Yeah, but I think that that's why I'm looking at it now, I'm looking at iCloud mail.
[51:36.520 --> 51:41.800]  And it looks way more like an iPad app than a Mac app, and, oh, yeah, the further you
[51:41.800 --> 51:47.320]  get in, yeah, the UI, I guess what I'm looking at is some of the things like, if you go
[51:47.320 --> 51:53.800]  into contacts and you click to delete somebody, it feels, it's iOS 70, but you can start
[51:53.800 --> 51:58.680]  to see the hinting like the way the window, the alert thing comes up, the delete confirmation.
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.680]  The way it comes up and the way it sits on the screen, that to me hints at what we wound
[52:03.680 --> 52:06.040]  up getting in Yosemite more than.
[52:06.040 --> 52:10.560]  It feels like a direct translation of anything from iOS.
[52:10.560 --> 52:11.560]  Yeah.
[52:11.560 --> 52:18.600]  Well, and the other thing, the big difference too, is that iOS, not iOS, the iCloud interface
[52:18.600 --> 52:25.400]  doesn't have a lot of the buttons don't really have strong tap down states, press states,
[52:25.400 --> 52:30.200]  I don't know what the best way to call it, I always call it tap down, but press to state,
[52:30.200 --> 52:34.200]  sort of like iOS, whereas Yosemite does.
[52:34.200 --> 52:38.200]  You feel pretty good, because that's been a thing for you, buttons that look like buttons
[52:38.200 --> 52:42.120]  has been my obsession, and to me, Yosemite doesn't change it at all, like buttons all look
[52:42.120 --> 52:46.680]  like buttons in a way that I really hope that iOS, I guess we have to wait for nine now,
[52:46.680 --> 52:50.440]  but I hope that iOS 9 takes some cues from that.
[52:50.440 --> 52:59.800]  Yeah, and there's, it's such a weird place to go from here, but the Google stuff, kind of,
[52:59.800 --> 53:06.080]  it's showing, if you, they're, the material UI, well, I'll hold that, well, finish your
[53:06.080 --> 53:08.760]  point, but let's come back to that, right, right.
[53:08.760 --> 53:15.440]  It's, to me, is kind of a hint of in an alternate universe, what iOS 9 might, a direction
[53:15.440 --> 53:20.280]  that it could go in, where it's a little bit more shadowy, it's a little bit like a return
[53:20.280 --> 53:27.440]  not to skew morphism, but some kind of happy point between super flat and allowing the
[53:27.440 --> 53:29.920]  z-axis to mean something.
[53:29.920 --> 53:36.840]  Yeah, I could see that, so we can go back to that, the, the, right, like I, from, to come
[53:36.840 --> 53:39.480]  back to something from five minutes ago, the one, one of the things I don't like about
[53:39.480 --> 53:45.400]  Yosemite is I don't like how the, if you have a dialogue box with cancel and okay buttons,
[53:45.400 --> 53:51.560]  the okay button is already blue with white text, but that's the tap down state for the
[53:51.560 --> 53:56.440]  cancel button, so if you press the cancel button, but don't let go, then the two buttons
[53:56.440 --> 53:58.840]  look almost identical, like right.
[53:58.840 --> 54:08.240]  To me, they picked a bad, a, a bad look for the default button, to me, the default button
[54:08.240 --> 54:12.480]  should look different from the other buttons, but it shouldn't look as different as, as
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.480]  the one in Yosemite.
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.040]  Yeah, and it seems like what you would want is something that both indicates that this
[54:18.040 --> 54:23.960]  is selected, but also, like, because some people are going to hit the, the return key on
[54:23.960 --> 54:26.480]  their keyboard rather than clicking button.
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.360]  Because then the other thing conversely is so that the, if the, the cancel button, or if
[54:30.360 --> 54:33.440]  there's more than one, if there, you know, any of the other regular buttons, the ones
[54:33.440 --> 54:38.400]  that don't activate just by hitting return, when you tap press and hold on the button,
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.720]  you get this really vibrant press state, it goes from a white background with black text
[54:43.720 --> 54:48.440]  to a blue background with white text, super vibrant difference from whether it's pressed
[54:48.440 --> 54:55.560]  or unpressed, whereas the default button goes from vibrant blue with white text to a slightly
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.520]  different shade of vibrant blue with white text, it's, it's an almost indistinguishable
[55:00.520 --> 55:03.920]  difference between pressed and unpressed.
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.000]  Just seems like an unforced error on Apple's part to, to do that.
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.880]  And it's a, it's a super niggling thing for me to dwell on, but it's one of the things
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.000]  where I, I can't get, even a month in, I can't get over it.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.640]  If you've been, I don't know, grousing about the buttons that tap down state and buttons
[55:19.640 --> 55:24.720]  since iOS 7 came out, or I think even during the beta's that's been like a, a thing
[55:24.720 --> 55:25.720]  for you.
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.640]  And maybe, maybe it really is just that Johnny Ive isn't really thinking too much about
[55:29.640 --> 55:31.400]  the way buttons look when they're pressed.
[55:31.400 --> 55:37.480]  Yeah, it seems like it seems like they've, I don't know, like I have a much bigger, I
[55:37.480 --> 55:42.000]  put more importance on it than, than Johnny Ive's Apple does.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.040]  But I think even more than I do, like it's, it's a good thing they care about, but it's
[55:46.040 --> 55:47.040]  like, I look at it.
[55:47.040 --> 55:48.240]  I'm like, well, you know, it doesn't really bother me that much.
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.800]  It's not the first thing I'd go to.
[55:49.800 --> 55:56.640]  The reason I care about it is that to me, it's the only real feedback you get, like in
[55:56.640 --> 56:03.040]  the real world when you click a button, there's no doubt in your mind when you've pressed
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.920]  it down and when you've let it go, because you feel it, right?
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.160]  If at least it's a nice button with a bit of clickiness, like the buttons on all the buttons
[56:11.160 --> 56:12.160]  on the iPhone, right?
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.400]  Here I am, I've got the iPhone in my hand and I'm pressing the volume buttons and they
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.600]  click and I know when I've pressed it down, because there's a click and I know when I've
[56:19.600 --> 56:21.720]  let go, because it clicks the other way.
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.760]  Whereas when you're pressing things on screen, especially on the iPhone, to me, it's
[56:25.760 --> 56:29.760]  even more important on the iPhone, it's like you don't feel any click.
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.400]  There is no haptic feedback.
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.880]  And you know, who knows, maybe that's where they're going with new devices later this
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.680]  calendar year is haptic feedback.
[56:39.680 --> 56:42.240]  But then why did they change it a year ago in iOS 7?
[56:42.240 --> 56:46.880]  You know, I know, I remember last year, during the summer, a lot of people speculated
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.640]  that the decrease in visual feedback on press states for buttons, you know, a lot of
[56:52.640 --> 56:58.560]  people were guessing there'd be haptic feedback in the iPhone 5S and there's not.
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.240]  So to me that visual feedback is all you get and so to me it's worth emphasizing.
[57:03.240 --> 57:06.360]  When we were at build, we were playing with some of those, they had that press room where
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.200]  you could play with the phones and stuff and a lot of the, I think most of them if not
[57:10.200 --> 57:11.560]  all of them had haptic feedback.
[57:11.560 --> 57:14.520]  So you'd tap something and it would give you like a little bit of a buzz.
[57:14.520 --> 57:18.920]  And in playing with it, I realized it's just, it's not the magic that I thought it was
[57:18.920 --> 57:20.880]  where the thing right under my finger is buzzing.
[57:20.880 --> 57:23.000]  It's just the device vibrates.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.640]  The reason you couldn't do that today on the iPhone, right.
[57:25.640 --> 57:29.120]  But that's, yeah, I think if Apple were going to do it, they'd want to do some kind of
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.960]  advanced thing where it literally somehow gives you feedback right where you've pressed.
[57:33.960 --> 57:39.000]  Not that the whole device is vibrating, which is what the Windows phone devices do.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.800]  Like I think they were all, weren't they all set so that when you're typed, H key press
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.760]  gave you a tap?
[57:44.760 --> 57:45.760]  Yeah.
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.000]  And it was not like, it's not like your phone buzzing in your pocket buzz.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  It's not that kind of vibrate.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.240]  It's just like a little, yeah, just a little something like you don't, you almost
[57:53.240 --> 57:54.240]  even notice it.
[57:54.240 --> 57:56.960]  Yeah, I didn't hate it, but I didn't find it helpful either.
[57:56.960 --> 58:00.880]  I liked it until I realized that there's no magic there and it was just my, it was just
[58:00.880 --> 58:02.120]  the phone buzzing in my hand.
[58:02.120 --> 58:04.160]  Well, it doesn't solve to me the problem.
[58:04.160 --> 58:09.080]  So for example, on the iPhone keyboard, right from the get go from 2007, when you press
[58:09.080 --> 58:17.720]  a key, you get, like you press the S key and S pop up shows up above your thumb.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.720]  Yeah.
[58:18.720 --> 58:22.800]  And it's like, so if you're watching as you type, there's this visual indication that
[58:22.800 --> 58:30.320]  you just typed an S because you, there's no other, you know, you need that feedback
[58:30.320 --> 58:33.720]  because there's the buttons or the buttons for each key on the keyboard or so close to
[58:33.720 --> 58:35.680]  each other that you wouldn't know.
[58:35.680 --> 58:39.920]  Whereas if the whole phone vibrates or taps in the exact same way, no matter which key
[58:39.920 --> 58:45.880]  you pressed, it doesn't help you know that you typed an S instead of a D. It's, you
[58:45.880 --> 58:47.920]  just know you typed something.
[58:47.920 --> 58:50.160]  And to me, that's, that's not helpful.
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.280]  Have you ever done one of those tests where you see if you type better with the, the clicks
[58:54.280 --> 58:55.640]  or without the clicks?
[58:55.640 --> 58:56.640]  No.
[58:56.640 --> 59:01.320]  I, you know, I've always got the bringer off on my phone because I just, I, I almost
[59:01.320 --> 59:03.760]  never want to hear my phone ring.
[59:03.760 --> 59:08.520]  But it seems, it seems like when the clicks are on, my typing accuracy goes up.
[59:08.520 --> 59:09.520]  I think so too.
[59:09.520 --> 59:11.880]  I keep the clicks on.
[59:11.880 --> 59:14.680]  There's the, well, I mean, I keep the clicks on my, my ringers always on.
[59:14.680 --> 59:15.680]  Right.
[59:15.680 --> 59:16.680]  So you don't actually hear them.
[59:16.680 --> 59:17.680]  Right.
[59:17.680 --> 59:20.080]  The building I live in, there's, I got to enter a key code to get in.
[59:20.080 --> 59:24.000]  And a month or two ago, they, they change, I don't know what they did, but it no longer
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.280]  when you dial the keypad, they don't be about you anymore.
[59:27.280 --> 59:30.720]  And without the beeps, I'll screw it up two or three times before I get in.
[59:30.720 --> 59:31.720]  Hmm.
[59:31.720 --> 59:34.320]  I like the key types, key types, but there's some, some people who think that that's
[59:34.320 --> 59:40.960]  so absurd that they can't believe they, they find it shocking that I use the, the key clicks
[59:40.960 --> 59:41.960]  on the iOS.
[59:41.960 --> 59:42.960]  It's similar though.
[59:42.960 --> 59:46.080]  The key clicks aren't that much of a help because they, it's similar to the whole phone
[59:46.080 --> 59:49.440]  vibrating at each time, you get the same click no matter which key you've pressed.
[59:49.440 --> 59:52.000]  It doesn't help you know that you got the right key.
[59:52.000 --> 59:56.880]  As opposed to like on a hardware keyboard, like on a blackberry with a hardware keyboard,
[59:56.880 --> 1:00:01.760]  you know that you've pressed the right key because there's an actual physical sensation.
[1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:04.080]  But the physical sensation is identical for each key.
[1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:08.000]  Yeah, but you, in practice though, if you think about it, if you've ever, I've never
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.280]  used a blackberry full time, but even if I've just toyed with one, you know, you've
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:17.960]  gotten the right key though spatially, you know, like if your thumb is on that border between
[1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:24.600]  S and D, you know that you want that depressation to be on the left side, not the right side.
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:28.760]  And if you do hit a D by accident, you can feel, oh, my thumb was too far to the right,
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:32.600]  you know, because the way the key presses in, right, only ever presses in, it doesn't
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:33.600]  slide around.
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:38.520]  So depending like your angle of attack will change the physicality of it, it clarifies,
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.520]  you know, and that, that would be the sort of, I don't know what the technology would
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.160]  be, but if there was a way to make it so that you got a physical click or press or some
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:52.480]  kind of sensation right on the pixels that you've pressed, it could, I could see how that
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:57.200]  would help something like keyboard typing tremendously, but I don't even know if, I mean,
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:01.760]  I've never heard of such technology, they should just put a hardware keyboard on those
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:02.760]  things.
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:03.760]  Yeah.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:06.400]  I do think, going back to Yosemite though, overall though, I like it a lot.
[1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:10.200]  And every time I stop using, I have it on a separate machine right now, I don't have
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:16.400]  it on a main machine, but every time I go back to Mavericks, it just feels like going
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:19.000]  back to iOS 6, but even more so.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.280]  It was like a little bit of culture shock for me, I have just been in a couple of days
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.440]  in Yosemite coming back to Mavericks, and I'm used to it now, and this is, it's fine.
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.840]  I don't hate it.
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:35.440]  It doesn't feel as dramatic as iOS 6, iOS 7, going in the direction, but it does, I am
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:37.440]  surprised at how much I like it.
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:40.000]  Yeah, it's not as, yeah, it's funny.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.640]  It's not as big a difference, clearly not as big a difference as iOS 6, iOS 7, but somehow
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:51.040]  going back, it was harder, quicker, because it's so familiar, it's just an improvement,
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:56.400]  I think in almost every way, that it makes going back worse, whereas iOS 7, there were
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.360]  things that just took time to get used to, whereas Yosemite to me doesn't take any time
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:01.360]  to get used to it.
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:02.640]  It's like, oh, this is just better.
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:03.640]  Yeah.
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:04.640]  There's not a lot of downside.
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:05.640]  Here's an iOS 7.
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.400]  There's, well, I don't know how I feel about the status bar thing, I don't think I like
[1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:13.240]  it, and these buttons are weird and there's a bunch of stuff with Mavericks to Yosemite.
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:17.200]  It really does just feel like they dialed it up a little bit.
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:21.880]  I'm curious, and I saw, did you see that Tobias Fair Jones, somebody asked him what he
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:26.920]  thought about Helvetica as a system font, oh no, I didn't see that, I have to look at
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:32.440]  it afterwards, but the gist of it is that, I'll put it in the show, let's show notes,
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:43.120]  I promise, but somebody asked Tobias Fair Jones, formerly of Heffler Fair Jones, and
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:51.760]  the whole ugly divorce going on there, but the designer of Gotham, among other very, very popular
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.400]  and well-designed fonts.
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:59.600]  He spoke very highly of Lucida Grande as a system font, and mentioned that some of the problems
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:05.720]  with Helvetica as a system font, but I think the bottom line, and he mentions it too,
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:12.800]  is that it's, it's Retina versus non-retina, and I've only been using Yosemite on a Retina
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:17.840]  MacBook Pro, I haven't looked at it yet, I guess I should try it, maybe put it on my
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:23.600]  MacBook Air or something, and see what it looks like on a non-retina display, and I can
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:25.480]  only imagine it is going to look worse.
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:31.760]  I do think that's one of the things about Yosemite that is very much in spirit with iOS
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:38.360]  7, is that it's a Retina first design, it's designed to look, it's optimized for Retina
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:44.120]  displays, and it's secondarily meant to look okay on non-retina displays.
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:48.760]  Do you think that's a hint at Apple wanting to move to, or being ready to move to a future
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.600]  where there's only retina screens?
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:55.880]  Oh, definitely, I mean if anybody thinks it's not going to be all retina at some point
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:00.200]  the next few years, I mean you're nuts, but I mean how quickly that's going to be, hopefully
[1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:03.600]  it's a sign that it's going to be sooner than rather than later.
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:07.080]  Right, that's what I mean, like if they're doing, if they're already setting things up
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:11.480]  for, it's going to look, I mean anything, everything looks better on Retina by definition,
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:17.040]  but some things translate the other direction better than others, and I can, I don't have,
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.520]  I don't think I have anything with a non-retina screen on it, kind of think of it, because
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:25.560]  you don't have a desktop display anymore, you just work off a 15 inch Mac book pro.
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.400]  Yeah, 15 inch Retina.
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.040]  So I don't know, I haven't seen, well you know I'm looking, I'm looking back, Helvetica
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:38.440]  was a system font on the iPhone from day one, and that wasn't terrible, I mean it wasn't
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:44.760]  maybe not as readable as Lucidogram, but yeah, it always worked on iOS, and it wasn't
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:49.600]  bad, but I do think it's going to be worse, and I feel like the same way that it did work,
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:56.600]  and it was fine on iOS pre-retina, it's definitely going to be, I think there'll be complaints
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:02.400]  about it though, when Yosemite actually ships, I wonder if Apple's new philosophy about
[1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:07.160]  and 100 and the people is the same as mine, I was like yeah, I don't think so yet, I think
[1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:11.160]  maybe on iOS it is, and I think that you know, I feel like the only people who they really
[1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:18.600]  care about, vaguely, it would probably be owners of the original iPad mini, because that
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:25.640]  device is only, they were still being sold a year ago, and you could still buy them
[1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:35.400]  now, right, isn't OK, I think so, I think that it's like the low-end iPad, let me see.
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:38.360]  That's the last one that I feel like they really care about, because the last iPhone
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:42.920]  that was pre-retina was 3GS, I mean that's forget about it, I mean you know, God bless
[1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:50.680]  you if you're still rocking your 3GS, but yeah, maybe they're not, I don't know, maybe
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:58.120]  let's see here, compare. Yeah, they still sell the iPad mini without retina display, 16 gigabytes,
[1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:06.200]  2.99. So, but you know, I've Jonas uses my old one, and it's not bad, I mean, it's,
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:13.720]  you know, it's, you know, I don't know that it's any worse than the Helvetica was as the
[1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:20.040]  system font on iOS 6, maybe some of the lack of contrast makes it less showy offy, but
[1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:24.760]  yeah, you know, it's like I wrote about when they first went retina, it's that I, I think some
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:31.800]  of those, the visual trickery making buttons look likable and putting a lot of, you know, lighting
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:37.480]  effects on the buttons and stuff was all to sort of make the thing look better than the display
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:42.680]  was capable of really looking, whereas with retina displays, you can just let it actually look good,
[1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:48.440]  just by bright type on a plane background. Right, and I'm not saying that there,
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:54.040]  this would be in, in the spirit of, well, who cares what it looks like on a non retina screen,
[1:06:54.040 --> 1:06:59.160]  so much as it is, I don't think Apple, at this point, just going by what they've done with
[1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:03.800]  Helvetica's system font on Yosemite, I don't think that they're willing to sacrifice what they
[1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:08.840]  think is the path forward to make things just a little bit better on non retina screens.
[1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:12.760]  I will say this, using Yosemite, and not, you know, I've used it to fair, I don't have it on my
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:19.240]  main machine yet, but I've used it as much as I can in the last month. Third party apps, it, it varies,
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:25.640]  it actually really varies how much they get automatically, none look perfect automatically,
[1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:32.680]  but some look a lot better than others, and you can see who was specifying here, display this
[1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:39.000]  list in the system font, and then there's others who said display this list in Lucidogram, 12 point,
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  and the ones who were saying just give me the system font, they get Helvetica, Noya,
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:50.120]  automatically, and it looks pretty good, and the ones who were using Lucid, it just looks old,
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:54.200]  and then, you know, some of the icons translate a little better, like toolbar icons translate
[1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:59.800]  better than others, some don't, but I'm really curious, and it's, to me, it's a lot like
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:05.400]  the shift from iOS, where, you know, app makers have got to get on, you know, got to get updates
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:10.840]  out the door, and make their stuff look right on Yosemite, but I'm curious if it's going to take
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:17.160]  longer for third party developers to update their Mac apps just in the way that, because they're too
[1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:23.560]  busy updating their iPhone apps first. Yeah, yeah. Well, I think, I mean, if you're smart, and the
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:30.520]  convention is that you're supposed to stick to the, the APIs as much as you can, because if Apple
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:34.600]  changes something out from under you, you get that change for free. This is why you're supposed to use
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:40.280]  like a stock source list and not roll your own. Um, so it's a funny one to me, my favorite example
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:46.680]  of an app that looks even better in Yosemite is net news wire three. I don't know that I looked at
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:51.160]  net news wire three. I opened up net news wire thing. It looks on a on a retina screen that's got
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:56.200]  some, you know, weird issues on Mavericks. And it just, you know, it looks, it looks not bad. I still
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:01.560]  use it as my daily news reader, but it looks dated. And I opened it up on, on Yosemite, just
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:06.280]  because I wonder, you know, read my feeds. I don't know, but it looks great because the font are
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:10.440]  all how that, uh, yeah, everything's in Helvetica and the source list is the, uh, the vibrancy
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:15.480]  transparency. Oh, really? Yeah. It's one of the most, uh, one of the most Yosemite ready apps I had
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:21.560]  on my Mac. Yeah. You know what? That is another thing that I've noticed is that it's clear,
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:25.320]  I didn't even know there was such a thing, but there must obviously in hindsight, there must be
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:34.040]  like a, give me a default looking sidebar. And those apps look pretty good on Yosemite and it's
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:38.840]  translucent already. And then there's others where they've got like a blue background with,
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:46.600]  um, you know, the wrong font. And it just looks so dated. It looks foreign. Well, it reminds me
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:53.960]  of, um, template images. So the, the icons that you create for a sidebar source list on the Mac and
[1:09:53.960 --> 1:10:00.840]  the things, uh, like a tab bar based app on the iPhone, you instead of making an icon that looks
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:07.400]  like what the end user sees, you just make, uh, an alpha, uh, an alpha channel icon where the,
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:14.520]  the gradient is, is what determines the alpha. So whatever Apple does to update the OS,
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:19.720]  whatever the new style is, your, your app running on that version of the OS will look like
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:25.000]  every other. So you're never stuck, like if you were to go in and make, uh, like looking right
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:32.280]  now at my screen, I see finder and Mavericks has that like all of the sort of monochrome slightly
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:38.120]  slightly washed out icons along the side, like the, uh, the iTunes style. Those are all just,
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.840]  you know, flat black and white alpha channel, uh, probably J pegs or PNGs, sitting somewhere.
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:50.520]  And then the second the OS gets updated, they all look the new way. Right. I think bottom line
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:57.800]  wrapping up Yosemite, I, I really like it. I think that it's, it's exactly exactly what Apple
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:04.360]  should have done. I don't think anything more radical is called for, uh, and I think it's going
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:10.280]  to prove to be far less controversial. I still think there's some people who are, who consider iOS
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:16.120]  seven controversial, right? There are people who refuse to upgrade still. Yeah. I don't think
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:20.680]  that that's going to happen with Yosemite, just because of the appearance and, and other than the
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:24.360]  appearance, it's not really that different. You know, they haven't really changed any of the
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:30.040]  other rules. Uh, no, but I do feel like, uh, especially with, we, we don't see any of this really
[1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:38.840]  today because it's all betas, but, uh, the extension stuff and the handoff, I think this to me pushes
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:44.760]  towards that, that ideal of ages ago, a friend of mine told me that his vision for computers in
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:48.920]  the future would be like, you carry the thing around like your phone or whatever it is. And you
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:54.920]  can use it the way it is. And when you get to work, you, you dock it somehow. Yeah. And then the,
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.560]  the interface changes so that it's, it's, it's custom. It's tailored to the way you're working
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:03.880]  right now. And now the Senate can drive a 30 inch display on your desk. Right. Right. And we're
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:07.800]  Apple, Apple's doing it. And I think an even more clever way, which is allowing you to pass
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:12.520]  what really matters, which is the state and the data back and forth and let the, the machines be
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:17.480]  their own thing. Yeah. Because at a certain, and who knows, I mean, I, I don't know, I feel like
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:23.080]  that dockable idea. It always, it sounds good, but it always runs into problems. And, and, for
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:28.520]  example, your desktop computer, if you have a power source, even if it's a laptop, but if you can
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:34.440]  put a power source into it at your desk, you, you want to be able to have apps running and
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:40.520]  consuming significant amounts of CEPU in the background. Whereas your phone, you'd never want that.
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:48.520]  Right. Right. So what do you do? Like you can say, okay, when I dock the thing, it, it runs like a
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:54.280]  real Unix computer and applications in the background can just do what they want. And then I want
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:58.040]  to go to the bathroom and take my phone with me and just pick it up. Then what happens to all
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:03.080]  those processes that were running? Like all of a sudden, now they're told, nope, nope, now you're,
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:10.280]  you're going to be put to sleep in 10 milliseconds. Hurry up, hurry up and finish. And the, I mean,
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:15.800]  you could do things like the dock itself has additional CPU and memory resources and maybe
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:20.760]  those processes can attach to the die. It just gets super like the kind of people who really
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:25.640]  like running Linux would, would enjoy that. Yeah. I think that this is a better approach. And it's,
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:29.960]  you know, we can even spin it as we talk about some of the Google IO stuff and it's, you know,
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:36.280]  similar approach, but that Google has that it's not one machine that you take everywhere, but like
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:44.760]  one set of state that's available everywhere. That it's state that syncs not the actual computer.
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:51.560]  Right. And I, I was eight and Yosemite to me feel like we were finally there or, or we're very,
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:57.080]  very close to that your, your iPad and your iPhone, your Mac all work together. Yeah. One question
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:00.360]  people have been asking me, I actually don't know the answer because they don't have a spare
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:07.400]  iPad to run iOS 8 on and I'm a little hesitant to put it on, on my iPad. I'm running a full time
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:12.760]  online. It's great. You know, I got to see it because I've had problems in the past years where
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:19.320]  the MLB app doesn't work on the beta. And it's like the only app that I really can't do without
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.040]  over somewhere on the iPad. So I have to see, but I'm the wrong guy to ask about that. But people
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:29.080]  have been asking, well, this work between continuity, like handoff, like I've started an email,
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:34.840]  can you hand it off from an iPhone to an iPad? Or is it only from Mac to iOS? I think it's only
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:40.440]  Mac to iOS. I don't think you can go iOS to iOS. But it seemed, that seems like something that,
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.600]  that it could be like a 8.1 update or something later in the year. It makes sense, you know, that
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:52.200]  you might want to, somebody, you know, hey, I want to go from this small machine, the iPhone,
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.880]  where I'm pecking this thing out with my thumbs to the big machine where I do my email,
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:15:01.000]  the big, somebody else's big machine for email might be their iPad. So I could see it coming.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.880]  I don't think that it's there yet though. I could go test it. I don't, don't bother.
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:13.480]  Tweet it later. I am, I'm impressed with iOS 8. I'm running, I always say it on my phone,
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.920]  my carry phone, my day phone. And on my, my day iPad, I've only got the one iPad. But yeah, my retina,
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:24.200]  iPad mini, both are running iOS 8 full time and both. There, I mean, there's weird stuff,
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:28.680]  like, I got to reboot my phone every couple of days because things just get wonky.
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:31.800]  Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up because I've been meaning to talk about this.
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:41.080]  So what I do is I have, I still have my year old iPhone 5, which is also on Verizon. So I just,
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:47.080]  if I, and I have iOS 8 on that device, and I just take my SIM card out of my daily iPhone 5S,
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:51.560]  put it in the five, and then I can just use that phone all day. And I've spent a week
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:56.200]  using just that and it's pretty good. That's the smart way to do it. Yeah, but you have to make,
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:00.680]  you know, I couldn't do it the year before though because last year was the year where I had
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:07.240]  switched from AT&T to Verizon. So my year old iPhone 4S, I couldn't SIM card swap with the
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:12.760]  Verizon. So it only works so long as your year ago phone is on the same carrier.
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:20.520]  And same SIM setup because, yeah, exactly. Right. So like, Verizon phones were not, well,
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:24.760]  there were world phones, but they, you could not remember. Yeah, it was funny. And then every
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:29.560]  couple of years they, they cut the SIM card sides down too. Yeah, because it was mini and now it's
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.640]  mic. Right. Like maybe with the iPhone 6, they're going to come, you know, and make an even smaller
[1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:37.320]  SIM card. I don't know. And now it's just, it's a, you get an eye dropper and you just drop it in
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:41.560]  there. Yeah. One thing though, this is the thing I've been meaning to talk about is this was the first
[1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:48.280]  year. So I've tried to do this, you know, run, run the beta on my year old iPhone as much as I
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:54.440]  can over the summer. And even like last year when I couldn't SIM card swap, I would at least carry
[1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:59.400]  the iPhone 4S around in the house on the Wi-Fi as, you know, the only thing I couldn't do is
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:02.680]  get phone calls. But I don't, like I said, don't get many phone calls. But everything else I get,
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:10.680]  this is the first year where I don't find going back to the iPhone 5 to be slow, physically slow,
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:15.560]  like the interface feels slow. I noticed it in some places, but like the keyboard doesn't feel
[1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:21.720]  slow. Like it always, that's the one thing. Every single year when I test the new beta of the
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.200]  operating system on my year old iPhone, I think, and how did I ever type on this thing? The keyboard is
[1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:31.400]  too slow. And it's never been, I don't know if it's because there were, you know, the operating
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:38.120]  system slowed down. I don't know if it's just that I got used to the increased or decreased latency
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:43.080]  of the interface responsiveness. But this is the one year where for my most part day to day,
[1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:47.720]  I don't feel that much difference between the 5S and 5 just in terms of navigating around the
[1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:53.480]  operating system. Well, this is with you running iOS 8 on the older phone. Yeah. You typically,
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:58.920]  you're saying you typically run the new OS on the older phone. Yes. I'm thinking that it has more to do
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:03.080]  with the newness of the OS than the age of the phone in terms of your keyboard latency.
[1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:08.360]  I don't know. I just, I'm thinking, maybe that maybe it's that iOS 8 because they didn't do
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:14.360]  anything new interface wise radically that it's nothing, nothing but improved performance wise.
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:19.320]  As opposed to like last year, obviously a lot of people had complaints that iOS 7 was dog
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:24.920]  slow on older hardware. Yeah. There's nothing. No, I don't think there's any reason to worry about
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:31.160]  that from iOS 7 to iOS 8. And I think it combines with the fact that maybe the iPhone 5 was the first
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:39.240]  one where the A6 was sort of good enough, you know, that it's, you know, at least for things
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.240]  like typing that we don't need, you know, the speed improvements, I'm sure help in image processing,
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:52.520]  for example, right? Like when you take 10 snapshots in a row using the press and hold thing,
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:57.080]  there's obviously a lot of computation that's involved there, the faster a7 really helps.
[1:18:57.080 --> 1:19:04.040]  But for just showing a touchscreen keyboard and typing, the A5 I think is where it hit the fast
[1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:10.200]  enough mark. Hmm. Because I'm doing it the other way around where I've got iOS 8 on my 5S
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:15.160]  and I've got iOS 7 running on a lot. I don't keep these devices around, so WWDC, you had brought
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:20.680]  Amy's old 4S for me. And having a two year gap between those phones, I'm running iOS 7 on the
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:27.960]  older phone and iOS 8 on the newer phone. And I noticed keyboard issues on my 5S. Oh, the 5S?
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:32.200]  Running 8? Yeah. Yeah. I like the keyboard feels a little sticky to me.
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.040]  Huh. That's interesting. That's what I'm thinking it might have more to do with the OS and the
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:39.000]  newness of that than it does with the hardware. I mean, I could be wrong. I don't know.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:44.440]  I'll just be my setup. Interesting. I will say this too. I don't know if I mentioned this before
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:51.400]  in the show, but a lot of the little things in iOS 8 are addictive, like the reply to an I message
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:58.920]  from anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. It is really, really nice. It's tough because that makes it hard to go
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:05.080]  back. I feel like when the next beta comes out, I'll probably just install it on my day phone too.
[1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:14.360]  It's funny because the normally year to year, the upgrade, it's tough to go back because
[1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:17.400]  there's like some big new feature or there's something that you really like.
[1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:23.880]  Day to day using iOS 8 other than the, the, the typing suggestion thing, I don't really notice,
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:28.520]  like it just, it looks and feels like a slightly bug year iOS 7. Yeah. But it's got those
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:33.800]  nights that the notification thing for replying is really, really nice. I don't think I've used it
[1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:39.960]  that much. Oh, man. Once you start, it's, it's, it really gets, it just feels crazy to go back to
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:47.560]  not being able to do it. I do like getting text messages in, in multiple devices. Like I've noticed
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:52.120]  uh, when people text rather than like people who don't have iPhones, it shows up on my iPad now
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:56.200]  and it kind of freaked me out. Oh, see, I don't think I've noticed that yet because I get so few
[1:20:56.200 --> 1:21:03.080]  text messages from that aren't blue. Yeah, it was a one, one, one came yesterday and I'm,
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:07.080]  I'm looking at my iPad and I see the name in there and I was like, wait, what, that person has an
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:11.240]  Android phone? How's this even possible? Oh, and it, wait, and it shows up on your iPad? Well, then
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:15.960]  maybe, maybe some of those continuity features do work iPhone dive pad, right? Because I think on
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:20.760]  the demo, during the keynote, they showed it showing up on your Mac. Right. They didn't show
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:25.480]  it on your iPad. Yeah. Yeah, I expected to show up on my Mac, uh, but I never would have expected it
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:31.320]  on my, I mean, it makes perfect sense. Yeah, I guess it was a surprise. I wonder if that's, it's got
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:37.960]  to be that they are, they're like on the same Wi-Fi network. Is it or me or maybe even Bluetooth?
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:42.920]  It's still confusing to me and I know that I've listened to a few other podcasts. Nobody's,
[1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:46.760]  nobody's quite sure which of these features are running over Bluetooth and which are running
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:52.840]  over Wi-Fi and which are maybe using both depending on their availability. Seems like a lot of
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:22:01.480]  this stuff though depends upon the Bluetooth LT low low low energy Bluetooth LE and they're,
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:06.840]  the cutoff on Macs for that is pretty recent. So there's going to be a lot of people with semi
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:11.320]  recent Macs like two year old Macs, two and a half year old Macs who want to upgrade to Yosemite
[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:16.280]  are going to be bitching because they don't get these features. I think, I mean, if it were me,
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:20.360]  I would make it to where it ran over Bluetooth unless Bluetooth wasn't available and then it ran
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:23.480]  over Wi-Fi because a lot of people turn Bluetooth off on their phone to say battery.
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:29.960]  Yeah, I feel like that trick is going to start. It's getting to the point where enough of the
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:35.720]  features depend upon it that, you know, I think most of, because I usually keep Bluetooth off
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:40.280]  too for the same reason, but I feel like it's going to get harder and harder to do that. Are you
[1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:45.240]  going to keep running into, oh, why isn't this working? Oh, do I turn Bluetooth off? Yeah, and I
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:49.480]  think enough people are still doing it though. It's going to be Apple wouldn't want to get
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:55.720]  those support calls. And if you could just fall back to Wi-Fi, why not do it? I found out my son
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:23:03.720]  runs his all of his iOS devices at maximum brightness all the time. Do you need to maybe send
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:10.760]  him to Wabi Parker? He knows that it's running, that it's running the battery down. And in fact,
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:16.680]  every day, his iPhone and iPad both completely run out of battery. And I said, hey, why look,
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:20.840]  you've got brightness all the way up. He goes, well, I'm not, he didn't say compromise, but he said
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:25.960]  I'm not going to, it's, he thinks it's gross to run the display at less than full brightness. He'd
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:35.400]  rather have the device be dead than have it not at maximum. Beauty, which I kind of respect.
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:42.120]  I respect his, I don't know, he's got a full Oscar there and he's sticking to it. Yeah, I'm
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.640]  that way with my Mac. My Mac is always at full brightness. In fact, that auto brightness thing,
[1:23:45.640 --> 1:23:50.760]  I never turned it off. I really should. But if I'm in a, like when, when I work out of the,
[1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:55.960]  the office, if I pass in front of a window or a certain time of day, my screen starts to dim and
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:01.240]  it just drives me nuts. I want it always as bright as it can possibly be unless I'm on a plane.
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:07.320]  Yeah, exactly. Like the airplane mode for Mac should involve cutting your display brightness down.
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:11.640]  Well, you know, that, that brings up something we didn't see in Yosemite. And I expect to at
[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:17.400]  some point, because you know, there's all this talk about, will we ever get like Y Macs or some
[1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:24.520]  kind of LTE chip or something in a Mac. And the only, like technically that wouldn't be that hard
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.560]  to do. It's just that software isn't really written for that. You're going to run through your data
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:33.240]  pretty quickly. Yeah, that's, it seems like we used to, who knows, maybe someday this year they'll
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:41.400]  come out with that. Well, they already kind of have it, like your Mac can, can talk to your, your
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:46.920]  access point and find out that it's an access point running over a data connection rather than
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:52.520]  running through like a, you know, a regular wired connection. Like that's a thing that they can,
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.080]  that the, like if you've got like one of those karma devices or something, it can report back to
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:03.880]  your computer that it's, it's like a, you know, a data network device. Hmm. Well, and there is the
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:11.000]  new feature in Yosemite and iOS 8, where once you've paired your phone with, if your phone has
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:18.360]  hotspot capability, you can turn it on entirely from your Mac without interacting with your phone.
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:23.640]  Right. So it seems like there would have to be some APIs in place or something to, I don't know,
[1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:29.560]  so apps can know when they're in that mode versus a different mode so that like things like automatic
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.840]  downloading for certain apps gets turned off. Right. I remember, I always remember it was Marco who
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:45.320]  at WWDC a couple years ago was tethering instead of paying for hotel Wi-Fi. And it was like,
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:51.560]  you know, he got there on Sunday. Monday was the keynote and then the new episode of Mad Men hit
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:26:00.280]  iTunes. He ran through like four gigabytes of LTE and got his like 18T account closed for the
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:05.400]  month because it downloaded an episode of Mad Men. That's fantastic. Right. But that's exactly
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:09.160]  the sort of thing you don't want to do. And I don't know how you, you know, I do think that that's
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:13.640]  basically why Apple hasn't done it is that that, you know, and I know, I guess that there's
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:19.880]  opt-in things that apps could do to say, hey, what kind of network am I on before I do this,
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:24.360]  but I feel like there's too much software that's already written that just says, do I have a network
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:31.400]  connection if so download this giant multi gigabyte thing? Right. And I mean, we live in a world now
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:35.880]  where there's a pretty good chance that your data connection is coming through the air.
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:40.920]  But even if you're on Wi-Fi, that's a good chance that the thing on the other end of that Wi-Fi
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:45.880]  is talking to Sprint or talking to Verizon or whoever. Yeah. I think that the new feature,
[1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:51.240]  I think that I think they're probably, well, I wouldn't say never, but my guess is they're never going
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:58.440]  to, they're not going to do LTE equipped MacBooks and that this new feature where you can turn on
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:05.480]  tethering from your iPhone right from the menu and on your Mac is as close as they're going to get.
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:09.560]  And that's pretty, that's close enough, I think. I was going to say, do you think that's good? Do
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.320]  you think that's, or would you rather have a Mac that had the data connection? Yeah, because you'd
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:18.200]  have to pay an extra 15 bucks a month at the minimum, depending on, you know, like Verizon, I think
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:22.600]  it's like every time you add a device, you have, we have like one shared family pool of data,
[1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:26.840]  but every time you add a device, you still have to add 10 bucks a month. So rather than add another
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  10 bucks a month, just, just let me use the phone because it's going to be the same connection
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:39.800]  anyway. Yeah, but with your phone, your Mac has a great big battery in it. Yeah, I, yeah. But if you're
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.440]  on your Mac and have your phone, you can, I don't know, yeah, you just charge off that. That's true.
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.880]  I suppose it'll work out. Yeah, I don't know. I think it's as close as they're going to get.
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:52.680]  It's, it's probably as close as they're going to get. And it's probably in the real world,
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:57.960]  all I would ever need. There's something nice about having all of the stuff on your Mac,
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:01.000]  like everything that you could have on your Mac, so it's just something. But the truth is, my
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.640]  phone's always in my pocket anyway. Yeah. All right, let me take a break. And thank our third and
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:14.280]  final sponsor, good friends at back place. You guys know back place online, unlimited backup for
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:20.040]  your Mac. They have over 100 petabytes, unlimited helmets, that is, of data backed up for all of their
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:28.440]  users across the whole system. It's amazing. Anyone can back up your day. You can back up your
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:33.080]  data, you know, with hard drives on your desk, you can send it to, there's all sorts of other
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:37.800]  online services. Here's the thing that they've done. They can prove they can show you, they have
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:42.920]  a record, a track record, not just backing up your data, but getting it back to you, like when you
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:49.480]  need it. They've crossed the mark. They have over six billion files that users of backblays have
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  restored from backblays, not just that they've, you know, backed up six billion, six billion
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:00.280]  backed up files that they've gotten restored because they needed it because drive went bad, a
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:06.920]  file went corrupt, something like that. You can access all of your data from anywhere, from any of
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:11.880]  your devices. They have an iPad app that lets you access and share any of your files. You can restore
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:19.880]  one file at a time or all of your files easily with their web restore. 25% of all the restores that
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:26.120]  backblays users do are just one file, right? It's super targeted when you need it. When you need
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:31.400]  that one file that, you know, have backed up. It's not just for computer disasters. It's for
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:36.280]  anytime when you're out in a way from your computer and you need a file. Oh, I know I have it on my
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:41.080]  Mac back at home, but all I've got with me is my iPhone. Just fire up the app. You can get to any
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:49.560]  file on your system. Founded by X Apple engineers, backblays runs natively on your Mac and on Mavericks.
[1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:57.000]  There's no add-ons, no gimmicks, no extra charges, no upsells. Just simple. Five bucks a month,
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:02.680]  per computer for unlimited, unthrottle backup. Five bucks a month, best five bucks a month you can
[1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:10.440]  spend. Get a no risk, no credit card required. Trial, 30 day trial, no credit card, just try it.
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:16.840]  And at the end of the 30 days, again, to you, you're going to sign up, go to backblays.com slash
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:23.240]  daring fireball backblays.com slash daring fireball. I can't, I can't believe there's enough
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:27.640]  people out there who listen to the show who haven't signed up for it that they still keep sponsor
[1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:32.600]  the show. I just opened up the page. I have not. And every time you, you do the sponsor read for them,
[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:37.320]  I'm always thinking, I really need to do this. So this time I got it open. It's the easiest,
[1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:40.600]  best thing in the world. You know, Marco had a thing that the other week, I don't know if you
[1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:48.760]  listen to ATP, but Marco had a thing where the drive in his Mac Pro went bad, like real bad,
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:53.480]  like a dangerous way where he couldn't boot the machine. And then when he booted from the emergency
[1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:57.240]  partition and ran disc utility, it told him there was nothing wrong with his drive. So there's
[1:30:57.240 --> 1:31:03.560]  nothing wrong with the drive, but he couldn't log, log into it. And long story short, he solved it
[1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:07.880]  another way. I think he used super duper and had like a super duper clone and did it, but like he
[1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:12.360]  even said on the show, one of the things, and this is to me is the, the key, it's that piece of
[1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:17.640]  mind thing where in the back of his mind, he knew if, if diddling around with what he had on his
[1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:22.440]  desk with backups and super, you know, super duper clones and stuff like that, didn't work.
[1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:28.520]  The worst case scenario is he still had everything in back place. It's like that, that piece of
[1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:35.880]  mind is to me, the key to back place versus any other thing that you could do like time machine
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:40.040]  and super duper clones, which are great too. It's that piece of mind though of knowing that you've
[1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:47.240]  got this other thing off site in the cloud. Really like, yeah, it's, I've got the page open as soon as
[1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:50.760]  we're done recording on the sign up for this because I had a, when I was doing my whole Yosemite
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:56.280]  second partition thing, I had some, some, some very close calls with my own data. And you know,
[1:31:56.280 --> 1:32:00.920]  everything that's really important I've got on Dropbox, so I, I wouldn't be totally screwed,
[1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:04.840]  but it would take me a good day or two to like try to get my system back to the way it was.
[1:32:04.840 --> 1:32:09.880]  And then it's never going to quite feel right. Yeah. And to just have all my, my stuff out there
[1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:14.360]  in one place backed up, I just need to do it. I'm, I'm stupid for not having done it already.
[1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:16.280]  You are.
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:25.000]  So Google material design, this is the new design language that, that Google announced last week at
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:32.040]  IO. I don't think, I think to summarize it to me, I'm not a daily Android user. I mean, I try to
[1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:38.840]  stay up to date. It's not as radical like going from the previous look to this new one is not as big
[1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:46.760]  a leap as iOS six to iOS seven. It's to me a little bit more like Yosemite, you know, it's like
[1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:53.080]  their equivalent of Yosemite. It's, it's, it's just to sort of cleaning up and modernization and getting
[1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:58.680]  rid of some walkiness. But I think it looks, but it's the first time to me that Android looks
[1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.880]  like from top to bottom, that there's one cohesive set of visual guidelines for how stuff should
[1:33:03.880 --> 1:33:09.560]  look. I think even more than the visual update, which you're right, it's not a, it's a huge leap,
[1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:13.720]  but what does feel like a big leap is the way they're documenting and talking about the design.
[1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:19.000]  Yeah, the design side, but it's weird. Like it, it's like at first, I was very complimentary to it.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:23.960]  And I still am. But judging it mainly on what it is that recommending that developers do,
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:30.520]  which I think is all right and good. And it's not just, hey, add animation to your user interface.
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:35.400]  It's add animation in a way that that increases understanding of what's going on.
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:41.400]  So if you open something, it doesn't just appear on screen. It opens from somewhere,
[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:46.120]  like from the button that you tapped to open it. And then when you close it, it goes back down into
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  the thing. Yeah, I was looking at the, the docs before we, we jumped on to do the show at just
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:58.600]  don't miss wanted to get my ducks in row here. And I noticed comparing the, uh, the Android design
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:05.160]  stuff about animation versus what is in the iOS 7 HIG. Like get them side by side in iOS 7,
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:09.160]  it says things that I'm not going to read it for beta, but it's more or less saying here's why
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.560]  you use animations and here's the, the scenarios and here's you want to be reserved and you want
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:19.320]  the animations to feel a certain way. And the Google site is okay. So here's the code to do an
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:24.360]  animation. And here's the direction things could go. And, uh, maybe there's some like footnotes
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:27.640]  here and there about why you would do a thing the way you do it, but it's still very, it's still
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.880]  very Google. Yeah, but some of it to me is not very Google. It's very, uh, my tie is wear tape in
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:39.720]  particular. Like he, I don't know him. I never met him, but he's, he seems a bit, uh, he's always
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:48.280]  struck me as on stage demeanor as being a bit tweet. Okay. Um, here's, here's a phrase a lot of
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:53.240]  people have called this out. It's very early on when you go to Google dot com slash design and
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:58.760]  start reading up on it. It's somewhere in the first couple of pages and it says material is the metaphor.
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:05.480]  Now this is I'm reading a material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:12.040]  system of motion. Our material is grounded in tactile reality inspired by our study of paper and ink
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:18.680]  yet open to imagination and magic. And what, what does that mean? That's a lot of, um,
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:28.440]  what does it mean? It means nothing. Right? That is an in fact, it's like Don Draper wrote that it's
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:33.000]  actually no because it don Draper, if Don Draper wrote it, it would, it would at least make you think
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.600]  something real. Like I think they're not just flowery. Right. I feel like Don Draper would go nuts
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:44.040]  at that. I feel like it's the opposite. It's it in fact, I think it's actually misleading where
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:49.080]  the only thing you come out of that is something something study of paper and ink, but it's not
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:55.480]  the rules of their new interface are not grounded in the realities of paper and ink. Right?
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:03.560]  There's no skew and more thick ink bleed or paper texture. And, you know, things bounce and move
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:10.040]  in ways that paper and ink can't bounce and move, you know, that they, you know, you can't have
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:15.320]  it both ways and say that you've based the metaphors on paper and ink and then increase the amount
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:22.280]  of animation and stretching that you can do. Right? It's actually false. It's actually misleading
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:29.000]  because paper doesn't move like liquid. Right. I think you're better off reading the Google
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:34.360]  material design docs, not reading the actual English and just looking at it, pretend, you know, just
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:40.040]  like, like, Laura Mipsum, all of the descriptions and just go through and look at it visually.
[1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:46.280]  And it, to me, when I did that, it makes way more sense than if you try to read it and understand
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:52.760]  what this should about a rationalized space and a system of motion. It's very hand wavy. It's like
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:57.880]  somebody you thought way too hard about this. Yeah, they want to make it seem like more than it is.
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:06.520]  Even during the keynote, I forget the line, but the, he said, uh, the ink, the ink, oh, God,
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:12.840]  I don't forget to call it, but the ink thing moves like water. And like right there, it's
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:18.040]  well, pick a metaphor. Is it, anchor is water. Choose one word now. You're already confusing things
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:23.720]  for me. I do think too. And I think it's interesting. I'd be interesting to see how quickly
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:31.400]  Android developers pick up on, on these guidelines because to me, every time I've tried Android,
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:37.240]  it's, it, the Google stuff is okay. It doesn't make me happy and it doesn't feel good,
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:43.160]  but it's okay. But then as soon as you get into third party apps, it's just brutal, just brutal
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:51.560]  in terms of aesthetics and layout. Um, and part of this is the advantage that a lot of this
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:56.760]  stuff doesn't come from the operating system, really. It's this Google play services thing that
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:02.040]  you get from the, the Google Play Store. And it's like this shared library. So that you,
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:08.040]  developers don't have to wait till everybody's running the new Android L, you know, version,
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:11.560]  I don't know if they're going to call it 5.0 or whatever, which is going to be years,
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:21.240]  but a big chunk of existing Android phones that won't get the upgrade to the full new OS will
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:25.640]  get the new Google Play Services, which is the shared library. And I think that I think this
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:30.600]  interface stuff will all be distributed through there. So it's interesting. I, I can't wait to see,
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:36.040]  because like with, with the iOS, all the major developers, every app that I, I can't remember how
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:40.600]  long it took till every app I use on a daily basis was updated for iOS 7, but it didn't take long.
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:48.040]  There's like one or two holdouts on like my first two home screens. I don't know that Android has
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:53.000]  developers who care about stuff like that. What seems like what they're trying to do looking at
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:59.400]  the Google.com slash design, this is pretty well put together. They're trying really hard to make
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:04.440]  it look like they care about design. And that sounds dismissive. But what I mean is they,
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:10.920]  they, they're really trying to get across the importance of design to developers. Like to maybe
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:15.560]  they've, they've recognized that that lack of consistency, there's like even fragmentation within the
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.200]  design of, of third party apps. And maybe if they can bump up quality, or maybe if they can set an
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:25.960]  example, they can bump up quality across the board. It's interesting to me that Apple's approach to this
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:31.320]  is they create thoughtful designs that people want to emulate. And then they go and document those
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:37.160]  designs and people will try to achieve that themselves, whereas Google will write documentation
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:42.440]  and make APIs. Yeah, I did, I noticed that too that I, and I watched that whole
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:51.160]  interpretable keynote. They didn't show as many apps as anyone near as many apps as Apple did
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:57.320]  when they showed iOS 7. And, and, you know, I think it speaks to the way Apple works, where
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:04.440]  Apple, Apple did redesign every single part of iOS, you know, all the apps, mail, and calendar,
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:11.160]  and, you know, everything. And it's the way, you know, let's face it, you know, you can admit that
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:16.280]  you've even said you've read the Hague, but let's face it, you, you design stuff mostly by,
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:21.160]  you look at what Apple's done, you digest it and internalize, okay, here's the way it's supposed to be,
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:26.120]  and then you kind of shoot from the hip, you go from your gut, and you know it, you know, you don't
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:32.760]  sit there with the Hague Open, and, you know, okay, it says 16 points between these two things,
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.840]  so I'll make these two 16 points. I mean, so at some point you go and you know, make sure you've
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.560]  got everything like that, right? But when you've got Photoshop open, you're creating art, not
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:47.480]  a description, right? And the, I say this all the time, but the G in Hague is guidelines, right?
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:53.240]  I think if the Hague more is like the, the instructions that come with a new device, or your
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:56.600]  toaster or something, like you might, like you're going to look through it, and you're going to get
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:41:01.080]  the basics, and you might refer to it later, but it's not, you don't leave it sitting next to
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:04.600]  your toasters, let every time you make toast, you read it. Same thing with like, strong and white,
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:10.920]  or any other writing guidelines for writers, a writer doesn't sit there with, you know, the Chicago
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:17.000]  manual of style open, and for each sentence, look it up, how am I supposed to structure the sentence?
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:21.400]  The writer just writes, and then every once in a while you run into a sticky situation,
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:24.920]  or your editor will say, or somebody who's read it will point to a sentence and say,
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:29.160]  well, isn't this ambiguous here, you know, and then you think, oh, I do need to look at the guidelines,
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:33.160]  you know, let me, let me see. But yeah, while you're actually writing, you're in a completely
[1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:37.480]  different mode, you're not referring to us at rules, you've already internalized them.
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:41.720]  Right. And either you have that, that structure, that framework in your head or you don't.
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:46.280]  Right. And it did seem like Google, and I think, you know, I think part of it is just the way
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.880]  Google is different than Apple, and part of it too, though, is that they're aware that their
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:54.680]  developer base is different. You know, I think your point there about internalizing it,
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:42:00.520]  you're, you're right, and that I think is what's telling here is that Google is, is setting this up
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:05.640]  to where, I mean, if you're, if you're not a good designer, then no amount of documentation is
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:10.760]  going to make you a good designer. And it's, I think if I have some kind of objection, or if I
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:14.440]  have a strong opinion about the way Google's doing things here, it's that they're sort of
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:18.040]  presenting it as if like, okay, just read this and now you'll be good at it.
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:22.440]  Yeah. And I think that that's, they're probably wrong on that part. I think, but you know,
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:27.240]  obviously, I think you and I, I'll even use the word biased, we're biased in that regard.
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:32.520]  But I do think we, we, we as a whole collectively have talked a lot over the years about how
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:37.560]  iOS, the average iOS user is different from the average Android user. And that's one of the
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:44.600]  reasons why raw market share comparisons are less valid than in many other contexts, because
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:52.280]  they're not, if the users have different expectations, different reasons for buying the device,
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:56.520]  if they spend different amounts of money, if they have different amounts of education,
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.160]  if they have different income levels, if they live in different places, if they tend, you know,
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:06.760]  tend to live in different countries, it makes a big difference on the value of them collectively
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:13.560]  as, you know, can you build a business just addressing these developers? I think less spoken about,
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:19.000]  but maybe even just as important is that I think there's very clearly a demographic difference between
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:24.680]  Android developers and iOS developers in the same way that there was always a difference between
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:29.000]  Windows developers and Mac developers. Yeah, you totally agree with that. And I think it's a,
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.040]  a very similar difference, you know, and that there'll be some companies will design,
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.000]  you know, have the same teams and have designers who do, let's make an app that looks as similar
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:44.920]  as we can on iOS and Android, and there's developers, you know, developers and designers who are
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:50.600]  working on both. And I'm sure I know I've read blog posts from some of them, there are designers,
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:55.800]  you know, talented designers who are either fans of Android or just the nature of their jobs,
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:00.840]  that's where they're working. I'm not trying to make the, you know, I'm not jumping to any kind
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:06.440]  of extreme conclusion that there's no good designers working on Android, but I think I feel very
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:12.840]  confident saying that most good mobile UI designers are either iOS only or iOS first.
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:19.000]  Right. I think that's a, some of that is that there's the moving target problem with Android,
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:26.200]  where, uh, which device, which set of, of APIs are you designing for? Yeah. Which version of the
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.400]  OS you're designing for? Are you designing for a hardware keyboard? Are you designing for software
[1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:33.400]  keyboard? Is there like a jog dial thing on the side that you used to, to navigate or is it
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:37.560]  all touch screen? And for, it's, it's all, it's even out a little bit. It's even that a lot
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:42.520]  because I, I Android, especially at the phone level, has unified, they've gotten rid of all those
[1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:48.040]  things. Like all those things that used to be claimed to be a strength of the platform,
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:51.480]  that some of the devices, you know, if you want a hardware keyboard, you can have a hardware
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:55.080]  keyboard. If you want a jog dial, you can have a jog dial. Well, none of the phones have those
[1:44:55.080 --> 1:45:00.200]  things anymore. They're just, that's good for everybody. But it, it means that there's,
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:05.080]  there's still, um, there's still some moving target stuff for, for Android hardware, where, uh,
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:09.240]  a designer for Apple platform, you kind of like, you know the screen size and you know the
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:13.880]  resolution and you know how, how big a thing needs to be and how you hold it and where your thumb
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:21.560]  ends up and, and that plus the fact that most users, I'm, I'm going to get in trouble for saying
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:27.880]  this, but, uh, by and large paid software on Android does not sell as well as on iOS. Yeah,
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.040]  I'm not going to get in trouble for that. I think everybody, I was, that was the more political
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:37.560]  version of what I wanted to say. But it's, uh, who, nobody is going to spend a ton of time
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:42.280]  designing software. Nobody's going to spend the money to, to pay a great designer to make software
[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:46.680]  that nobody's going to buy. Yeah, I can see that. It does make me wonder for, for, uh,
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:51.480]  for apps that are always going to be free, like, uh, you know, like a, the major, an MLB app that
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:56.200]  is, I mean, you pay for it, but it's like, it's so mass market that it, it doesn't matter that
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:46:01.320]  there's no inherent iOS versus Android bias there necessarily or for something that is like,
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:06.680]  maybe the Major League Soccer app where you just, if you're a fan, you're going to download it
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:13.240]  and it's free and it's the app exists to help get you excited about a different thing. Like,
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:17.160]  they make their money elsewhere. You look like a Twitter app or a Facebook app. It surprises me
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:23.560]  that there's, those companies aren't spending more on Android design. Yeah, me too. I don't know
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:29.560]  why. Here's a thing that I'm wondering about. So I've noticed, and I think that the new Google
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:35.240]  material design is largely in line with it is like when you look at the Google Maps app for iOS,
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:41.160]  you have the Google Maps app. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, that's my daily use maps app. Uh, it looks,
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:46.360]  you know, it's, it wasn't designed that Google Maps iOS app was not designed in isolation from
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:53.960]  this material design. It's not exactly the same, but it's, you know, the big difference is Apple
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.600]  has, you know, and we, it comes down to like what we talked about an hour ago about how Yosemite
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:03.560]  and iOS 7 look related, but they don't look like the same thing. Whereas material design,
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:09.960]  they're, they're flat out saying it's meant to look the same on a Chromebook and on a tablet
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:16.040]  and on a phone. Um, and I think implicitly, because some of the screenshots they've shown showed
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:22.280]  apps with an iOS status bar, not of Android status bar. And that I think that they're,
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:26.120]  they're presenting this as a design language that you could use for iOS apps too.
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:31.080]  And I think that they themselves have sort of been doing that, that their apps to me have
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:36.920]  always started looking a little bit more like moon man iOS apps. That's going to be a little tricky
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:42.200]  because they would have to give out some kind of, I don't know, framework or SDK to make those
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:46.120]  APIs work on iPhone. Well, I don't know if they're, I don't know if they're going to mean for
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:49.960]  third party developers to do that or if it's just something they're doing themselves internally.
[1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:53.560]  But don't you think like when I look at maps, like they've got like a back button that uses an
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:48:02.280]  arrow instead of a chevron and it doesn't, it doesn't slide from the side iOS. Apple's relationship
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.680]  with Google right now is such that I write that a lot of that off as just Google saying screw you
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.440]  who the Google is like, we're going to do our own thing. We don't care if it looks like an
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:16.200]  iPhone app. But it doesn't, you know, it's close enough. They're related enough. It's not like
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.960]  Windows phone, which Windows phone is a very different metaphor. Right. Right. It would really stick
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:29.160]  out. Whereas this is two takes on the same basic idea. Yeah. And I think, I mean, like I said,
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:35.400]  Google Maps is my daily use maps app and I don't find myself thinking, I don't hate it. I don't
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:42.120]  feel grossed out by its Googleness. But it doesn't look like an iOS 7 app. Right. And I wonder,
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:47.160]  like I feel like they're going that route with like Gmail and stuff too. Because that's the
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:51.880]  other app. That's the one app they did show off in the keynote. And I have to say the new Gmail app
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:49:00.760]  looks so much better than, than it used to look. Yeah. I haven't seen it. Yeah. But I, you know,
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:07.080]  it's, I don't understand the people who use the Gmail web interface or the, like I just use the
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:12.120]  stock mail app. Yeah. Well, the new Gmail app looks a lot more. It used to, like on Android, it looked
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:17.960]  like a web app and just even though it was a native app. It just looked just the spacing, the typography
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:26.680]  was just horrible. Really, really bad. Last thing I wanted to talk about, and this is from IO,
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.000]  is, is, in broad terms, I guess I want to write about it on daring firewall too. This is the
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.760]  thing I've been thinking about ever since is that there's all sorts of details. If we, and I love
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:38.840]  to examine the details, you know, spend, you know, we could spend the whole show just talking about
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:45.800]  the difference between Helvetica and Roboto font. But if you zoom out, take the 10,000 foot
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:54.040]  perspective, it's kind of remarkable. And I think, un-remarked upon just how similarly targeted
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:50:02.600]  Google and Apple's initiatives are, right? A tech company talking about, you know, set top devices
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:09.480]  that run mobile OS and have an app store and wearables and watchables and health tracking and
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:15.080]  heartbait rate monitors and footstep monitors and an API for apps to track those things.
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:21.960]  You know, and I know that the Apple wrist wearable is still a rumor, not a thing, but I mean,
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:25.960]  it's, it's one of those rumors that has a laugh a lot of smoke and everybody's talking about it.
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.720]  And people have been talking about an improved Apple TV with an app store for years.
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:37.080]  The health and fitness tracking Apple announced the, you know, the health API's home automation,
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:42.840]  they're both talking about that Google bot nest Apple, you know, flat out came out with iOS 8
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.480]  and said, you know, here we're adding these things and we're working with all these companies
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:52.120]  to sit your garage door opener and, you know, your thermostats and whatever it can all be hooked
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:59.320]  up. Notably nest was not on that list, right? Very noticeably. It's all the same sort of basic
[1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:03.640]  ideas, right? A car integration. There's another obvious one. Yeah. And you can say that all this
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:10.040]  stuff is obvious, but they're both all those things are on both companies agendas. How much of
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:16.360]  that do you think is me too? How much of it do you think is that's just where like even in a vacuum,
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:20.600]  both companies would have ended up here? I don't know. I find it remarkable. To me, it's very
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:26.040]  remarkable that there are all, all of those things I just mentioned are all on, are both on both
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:31.160]  companies agendas. I mean, because I think, I think I know enough to say, I don't know enough to
[1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:38.280]  say that Apple is coming out with a wearable device that you wear on your wrist. But I do know
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:43.160]  enough. I can say with certainty that they have investigated it thoroughly and that if they don't,
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:48.200]  it's because they rejected it. That they, you know, that they have people who I know were working on
[1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:56.520]  a wearable for your wrist. So they at least looked at it. All of those things, right? Watches or
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:52:01.960]  I call them wrist wearables because I'm not convinced that the ones that are going to be successful
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:05.560]  are going to be watch-like. But let's say something you wear on your wrist, health fitness tracking,
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:11.400]  home automation, car integration, TV set tops to all the same things. I just find that remarkable
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:17.080]  that both companies have their sights out on all those things. What else even is there? What else
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:22.600]  could they get into? Yeah, I don't know if it's, if it's just that there are all such obvious
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:28.760]  ideas for expansion or I almost see it as a byproduct of the relationship between Apple and
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:34.520]  Google now where they're so like, for a long time, you'd say that they're friends and I think
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:40.440]  we might be moving either in the middle of or right at the end of frenemies territory and it's
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:44.680]  about to get ugly. Yeah, I would say we're past that. I think they're an arch-rival territory.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:48.120]  I really think it's the thing that's already there. Yeah, I do. I think it's been there ever since
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:54.280]  the, I think it's been there for years ever since the Steve Jobs' internal Apple thing that
[1:52:54.280 --> 1:52:59.000]  don't be evil as bullshit. You know, I think it's been that way since then. Well, I mean,
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:03.960]  outwardly, like the way they behave to each other in public because even after that, it was still
[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:07.640]  the maps app was powered by Google. Yeah, but only because it had to be and they switched,
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:13.000]  you know, they switched before, probably a year before they were ready, but had to do it anyway
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:17.320]  because they couldn't get an extra year, you know, it was very contentious, you know.
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:23.400]  I know, I don't know. I still don't know exactly. I'd love to know in hindsight how much of it was
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:30.840]  and I know Forstahl took the blame for that for the, you know, the seriously lacking quality of it
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:35.640]  and as it debuted. And I think that the gist, I don't know this for a fact. I think this,
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:43.800]  this is all third hand, but the gist is that that the maps team led the rest of Apple to think,
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:46.840]  no, it's not going to be as good as Google Maps. It's going to be problems. We're going to take a
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:52.520]  hit on this. But that here's where we are, you know, the bar, if 100% is as good as Google Maps,
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:59.800]  we're at 75. And you know, given all the other considerations, you know, that's why we should go
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:04.440]  ahead and do it now because we're only going to get from 75 to 100 once we have real world usage
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:11.240]  data and can improve it. But then when it chipped, it was like at 40 on a scale of 100 and that
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:15.800]  there was less than what the internal team had promised, even if what they had promised was not as good
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:20.600]  as Google Maps. Like nobody in Apple, nobody thought, oh, we're going to make this transition and
[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:24.600]  it's going to be just as good. I mean, everybody knew you could just look at certain maps and see
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:29.080]  it didn't have as much detail. And not even that, but transit, transit directions.
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:35.320]  Yeah, well, exactly, which, you know, they're only adding now, right? Isn't that, isn't that
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:40.520]  in Iowa State or am I misremembering? If it is, I missed it. Well, but obviously they knew that
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  they were losing out on transit directions, which, by the way, is the reason that I switched to
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:48.280]  using Google Maps is my, my map. Yeah, that's huge. I mean, New York, I need, I need to know which
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:52.120]  train to take. Yeah, absolutely. You know, if you live in an area where you depend on public
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  transportation, it's, you know, like night or day, right? It's like having a weather app that
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:01.320]  doesn't even show your location. It is, it's true. You know, like, I think like when dark sky
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:06.280]  shipped, it was like, I think they only had like a US data source. So I know there have been some
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:10.280]  weather apps that only have US weather, whether it's, you know, it doesn't matter how cool the
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:17.000]  app is if you live in Europe. It's, you know, worthless. You know, if you take the subway to get
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.440]  to get places in New York City, Apple Maps isn't going to help you at all.
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:26.600]  Um, but I'm curious whether if, you know, and I think it was a problem for forced
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:34.440]  on and, you know, in terms of accountability that it wasn't as good as it was supposed to have
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:38.760]  been and as they were led to have been. But I don't know that they still wouldn't have switched
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:43.800]  at the same time anyway. It's just that maybe they would have positioned at different marketing
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:49.080]  wise to set the expectations lower because they were in such a tight spot in terms of
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:56.760]  Google demanding really deep access to users personal location data in exchange for
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:02.120]  the things that Apple really needed from Google, which were vector based maps instead of bit
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:08.040]  map maps and drive driving directions. You know, the thing that you really need for good maps
[1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:13.000]  database is data. And they, they even said like the more you use it, the better the service is
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:18.600]  going to get. Right. And so I think maybe in, in a, a perfect or semi-perfect world, they would have
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:23.800]  maybe, because like, what else did they have that wound up being way better after more people
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:29.240]  used to be because of data serious. Yeah. So maybe they would have like launched this alongside
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:34.680]  the maps app is like the new maps beta. I don't know how they could have done it if their
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:39.000]  relationship was better. But given the state of their relationships, I actually think even knowing
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:43.160]  how bad the initial version of maps was going to be that they did the right thing. I think the
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.560]  wrong thing was that they didn't present, they didn't lower expectations. And they could have
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:53.160]  even been more forthright about the fact that it was contentious, you know, that, you know, you know,
[1:56:53.160 --> 1:56:56.520]  I don't know. There's some way that they could have presented it that would have lowered expectations
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:01.640]  accordingly. And so it's tough to sell it that way. Yeah, but it's better than what they
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.400]  went through though. I mean, you can say that's tough to sell, but it's a lot tougher to say,
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:10.280]  wow, new maps is going to be awesome. And then you got the maps and your house wasn't listed.
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:16.600]  I just mean that it's, it's, I'm trying to imagine Apple getting up and like, what do they say?
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:20.120]  How do they point out how contentious the relationship was? Well, maybe that, maybe that they
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:24.760]  couldn't get into. But somehow they could have said, look, we're, you know, we're switching to this
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:27.960]  and it's going to protect, you know, they could emphasize the protection of privacy,
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:33.560]  which is true. It's absolutely, you know, there's no spin involved there. You could say it's
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:39.960]  spin by emphasizing the privacy protection. Because that was the bottom line is that Google was
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:47.400]  demanding access to user identifiable personal location data in exchange for all of the things
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:52.200]  that Apple needed to improve maps using Google Maps. And there was, you know, there was no going
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:58.040]  forward from that. And they had to announce the switch, you know, they couldn't announce the
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:02.520]  switch midyear. They had to, you know, the contract was up. They, I think to renew it, you know,
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:07.320]  Google might have asked for more than one year. It was either do it now when the contracts up or,
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:14.440]  you know, go through the pain of having all this, you know, succumb to Google's demands for
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:19.880]  user data, which they weren't going to do. You know, it's an interesting point, the contentiousness
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:25.640]  of the relationship because people like you and me knew that. But that's not everyone who uses
[1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:31.320]  an iPhone. No. Right. And Apple knows that and doesn't expect for Apple's internal negotiation
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:35.400]  problems to be, you know, that's Apple's Apple knows that that's their problem, not the user's
[1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:40.600]  problem. But, you know, that's an instance where it effectively became the user's problem.
[1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:46.040]  It's an interesting thought experiment that would go back and think about, you know, just yesterday
[1:58:46.040 --> 1:58:50.440]  it was the seven year anniversary of when the first iPhone shipped. And think, you know, I don't
[1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:54.760]  know why everybody was making, I mean, I even posted a few photos comparing the two. But, you know,
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:59:01.960]  why is seven a big deal? I'm not quite sure. But, you know, June 29th is like iPhone day. And it's
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:07.320]  interesting to go back to seven years ago and think about how, you know, the Google was a partner
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:11.560]  in the iPhone, right? And Eric Schmidt was called on stage in the keynote where it was introduced.
[1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:17.160]  And it was all hugs and smiles. He was a board member at Apple. And there was this whole look,
[1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:23.160]  we'll make the awesome device and Google will provide the awesome, you know, cloud services,
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:29.160]  like Maps and YouTube. It's interesting to think where we'd be today if that relationship had
[1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:35.080]  stayed like that. And Google hadn't gone into Android and built their own competitor to the
[1:59:35.080 --> 1:59:40.440]  iPhone and was the, you know, there was more of a happy relationship there. I don't think it would
[1:59:40.440 --> 1:59:44.840]  have lasted anyway, because I think even without Android, Google would have demanded the same,
[1:59:45.720 --> 1:59:51.240]  it wouldn't have changed Google's thirst for privacy invasive collection of user data.
[1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:56.360]  You could argue that it's a good thing even. I mean, it may be annoying for Apple that
[1:59:56.360 --> 2:00:01.480]  Google did what they did with Android, but at the same time, that relationship has evolved
[2:00:01.480 --> 2:00:06.280]  toward, I mean, the rivalry of that relationship is such that we're going to win out in a big way.
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:12.360]  If both companies are making all of these different kinds of things at the same time,
[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:18.680]  that means we as consumers get a choice. And we've got two very powerful companies with a lot of
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:21.800]  technology behind them, fighting out who can make the better thing.
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:28.440]  Yeah, I don't know. I kind of feel like Google's business model existed in Apple's blind spot
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:33.720]  at the time that it just never like Microsoft Apple understood, right? They're going to make a
[2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:39.480]  competing platform and they're going to sell it for $15 a pop to OEMs, you know, they understood that.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:45.720]  They didn't use the same business model, but I think that they saw like their potential competitors
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:52.520]  for the iPhone as being companies like RIM, you know, making their own, doing the same thing
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:57.960]  as Apple, making the whole widget, the OS, the services, the devices, and something like Microsoft
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:04.760]  where somebody would sell a commercial system to OEMs for a profit. I think the whole idea of
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:10.280]  we're just going to give it away for free and sell things at cost and make it up by collecting
[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:16.280]  user data and using that data to sell advertising, I think it existed in a blind spot for Apple.
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:21.080]  So you think that they wouldn't have expected Google to make this kind of stuff?
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:28.360]  Yeah, I don't think that Apple in 2007 when they agreed, hey, you know, because the stories
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:32.440]  that have come out since are that the Maps app was a relatively addition, but it was like,
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:37.000]  hey, what if we did this? What if we had Maps and we have GPS and we can triangulate
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:42.760]  location with cell towers and we could get a really cool, what if we work with Google and get a
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:46.920]  really cool version of Maps? And it was cool, right? It was really, you know, that was
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:53.480]  one of those things that made the iPhone not a phone, you know, it was like, it was this new thing,
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:58.760]  you had live updating Maps in your hand. It was amazing. I didn't know that it was a late edition,
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:03.080]  but that makes sense. And it shows that because the first iPhone didn't have GPS.
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:08.600]  Yeah, yeah, it didn't have GPS. I think it was entirely cell phone triangulation and Wi-Fi,
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:14.120]  you know, the network of known Wi-Fi locations. Because I remember with the early one too,
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:22.680]  if you had like a new Wi-Fi, like I had, I used to carry around a little airport express,
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:26.760]  like in my suitcase, I guess I still take it some places, but you know, that way I would hook up to
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:30.520]  the hotel, instead of using the hotels, Wi-Fi, I'd use the Ethernet and use the hotels Ethernet
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:37.480]  and set up my Wi-Fi. The iPhone had no idea where I was, until I got off the Wi-Fi and caught
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:45.960]  on the cellular. I don't know where we would be to think that that was a shipping thing.
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:51.160]  I mean, maybe that's the thing about the seven years is looking back and thinking like,
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:56.840]  how primitive was this thing? It was so advanced at the time, but from in only seven years,
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:05.000]  it's become, I don't know, almost a little folksy to think about an iPhone shipping without GPS
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:14.040]  or with a truly shitty camera. It's crazy. It was like, it shipped with like a really nice
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:20.440]  cell phone camera and what I used to think of as cell phone camera quality. Because I had to do
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:25.000]  this thing because yesterday I took photos side by side photos with the 5S and the original iPhone.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:32.760]  And I had to figure out how to get the photos from the old iPhone to my new iPhone to post
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:36.200]  them to Twitter. And I didn't want to go through the Mac. I was just sitting there watching
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.160]  soccer games and stuff. And I couldn't figure it out because I couldn't send text messages
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:48.440]  because I didn't have a SIM card for the old iPhone. It was running an old version of iOS that
[2:03:48.440 --> 2:03:54.680]  didn't have iMessage yet. So, of course, the old reliable email, you can always email yourself
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:04:02.840]  something. And I went to email the photo and just emailed it to myself, but it didn't ask me,
[2:04:02.840 --> 2:04:06.520]  do you want to send small medium or large? It just sent it. And I was like, oh, that's weird. I don't
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:11.640]  remember that. And then it showed up on my new iPhone a couple seconds later. And one was only like
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:17.160]  109 K. I was like, ah, it shrunk it. And then I realized, nope, that's how small the photos were.
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:24.120]  That was, it didn't ask because the full size photo was only like 200 kilobytes. It's tiny.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:27.960]  That was crazy. All right. Last thing. I know we've gone along. This is long even by talk show
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:34.040]  standards. But to me, it's emblematic of the differences is the car stuff isn't shipping yet.
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:39.400]  The home automation stuff isn't really shipping yet. I know that there's some new stuff with
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:46.600]  Nest. The one thing that started to ship are the watches, right? And now they last week at iO,
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:53.400]  they shipped the first two Google where watches and they had on site. They didn't give them to
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:58.440]  people yet. The prototypes of the mo, or not prototypes, but like early production models of the
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:06.680]  Moto 360, which is the round one. It doesn't even use the whole circle. Yeah. That's the bottom.
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:11.000]  You're the thing at the bottom. Right. It's not actually round. There's actually,
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:15.480]  I thought it was a bug. And then I read the red thing. So if you look at the pictures of the
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:22.600]  Moto 360 at the very bottom of the front face, like at the six o'clock area, there's a small black
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:27.720]  bar, like it's almost like a bottom letterboxing of a few pixels at the bottom of the screen.
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:34.440]  And apparently that's a feature, not a bug. It's where the display, they come to display drivers
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:39.480]  are. I don't even know what that means, display drivers, but I guess it's, in other words, for some
[2:05:39.480 --> 2:05:43.640]  technical reason, they couldn't make the full display round. I'm going to call that a bug.
[2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:48.520]  It just, it looks like somebody screwed up cropping an Instagram picture. Right. Well, who,
[2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:56.680]  who when you settle on that, who says, well, good enough? It's, it's, it looks like a joke. It
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:01.000]  looks, uh, the faith corpy had tweeted that, uh, it looks like something that would come out of
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:07.960]  a plastic egg. To me, it, everything about those watches emblemizes the difference between
[2:06:07.960 --> 2:06:14.360]  Google and Apple and Google fans and Apple fans, you know, and I don't mean it, like, I don't
[2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:19.160]  want to fans may not be the, but people who tend to be drawn to Apple products versus people
[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:24.600]  who tend to be drawn to Google products. And it, it's a sensibility. Yeah. And it just emphasizes
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:31.320]  how different we are. And in the fact, like, for example, the reaction from people who like
[2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:36.680]  Google stuff, and maybe they're, you know, like people who still are optimistic at Google
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:41.640]  Glass is going to be a thing, or maybe they own a pair of Google Glass. Um, and they attended
[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:45.960]  IO and they were there and they got to choose the, uh, the, they gave you either the Samsung or
[2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:51.560]  the LG rectangular watch. And they said later in a year, we'll give you the, we'll send you the
[2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:57.000]  Moto 360 one two. And they had the 360s there that you could play with in demo mode, but you couldn't
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:02.680]  like take it with you. Those people, and they say, I like it. I've got my Samsung gear live on. I
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:08.920]  like it. It's, it's nice. But I, you know, wow, the, the Moto, the Moto 360 one is even nicer. I
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:14.840]  can't wait for it. Right? You were already admit that the one that that shipping is so horrible
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:18.920]  that they already want the next one. It's the name. I keep laughing at the name. How do you call
[2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:24.520]  something a 360 one? It doesn't form a circle. That should, I never thought of that. It should be
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:30.280]  like the, the Moto 340. I don't even know how many degrees that is, but it's probably like, maybe
[2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:37.320]  it's like 300 the Moto 300. I think that it's such a perfect example of the Steve Jobs
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:43.080]  adage that you can't start with the technology and work your way back to the product. You have to
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:49.800]  start with the design and then find the technology to make it work that they've gone about this
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:54.120]  completely different. And in fact, they even said so on stage like the words where it's now
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:08:00.520]  possible to make a full powered computer that you can wear on your body that the technology now
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:05.080]  exists to make a, you know, a little watch sized or vaguely, you know, maybe even if it's a big
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  ass watch, but you can make a computer this size that you can wear on your wrist. And that's
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:14.440]  what would never say. And so here it is. Here we've made one, you know, as opposed to coming up with,
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:18.760]  here's something you would really want to do and, and that you would want to wear and then we
[2:08:18.760 --> 2:08:24.040]  figured out the technology to make it work. It's like completely backwards. It's very different.
[2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:31.080]  I will eat my hat if Apple unveils something in the fall that even vaguely resembles these,
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:38.600]  these watches define vaguely resemblance. Well, that it's, I actually have the thing right here,
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:42.760]  it's a Kickstarter project. I actually forget the name of it to kind of, it's not printed on the
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.240]  watch band, but it was a, it's a watch band you could buy to put an iPad, the square iPod
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:52.440]  nano in. Oh, yeah. Was it the TikTok or something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was it. And they
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:57.240]  sold them an Apple stores too. Yeah. And it was a Kickstarter project. And I bought it and, and
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:02.360]  four strapping and I scroll a little square iPod nano onto your wrist. It was great. And it's
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:08.600]  a nice rubber band. And I've worn it for listening to music or podcasts while running with an iPod
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:16.920]  nano. It's great. You put iPod nano on your wrist and there you go. Way better than strapping
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:22.520]  a full size iPhone on your arm with an arm band because iPod nano is very small.
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:29.720]  But these, the galaxy gear things are exactly as graceful and elegant and good looking as an
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:35.080]  iPod nano strapped to a third party. I think that was never designed to be a watch strapped to your
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:39.800]  wrist. Now, technically, there's obviously big improvements where the iPod nano didn't have
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:45.800]  any kind of internet access or live connection to your phone. It's an independent device and now
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:52.040]  they've got notifications and stuff like that. So there's a big difference in terms of the actual
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:56.520]  wireless thing. But just in terms of aesthetics, I just can't believe that that's what they've
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:02.920]  come up with. You know, and that the interface is no better than flipping around a bunch of
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:07.400]  screens. In fact, the interface is worse because they don't have any kind of home screen on the watch.
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:12.600]  It's like you've always got these cards that you flick and there's no sense of wear. I find it
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:18.040]  very confusing in terms of like spatial navigation. At least the iPod nano has a home screen where
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:23.960]  you squeeze down and you've got a grid of apps like iOS, which is still kind of a weird
[2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:29.320]  iOSification of it. It just doesn't quite fit on a screen that small. Yeah, I do. Like the
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:35.800]  the mode of three. I keep laughing at that name. It as a as a tech demo or as a, you know, if it,
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:40.600]  if you saw it in a movie and the hero had one that actually did use the full circle, you'd think
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:47.480]  that was kind of cool as like movie UI that would look cool in the real world with the bar at the
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:51.640]  bottom when it's weirdly letterboxed like that. It just, it feels like a joke. It feels like this
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:56.120]  is a half baked product and they're just trying to get it out the door so that they can get
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:00.360]  interest up for the next one. It's more about an investment in a hope that that kind of works out.
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:06.200]  But I just don't see how batteries can work out. I don't see how the UI like I don't know and
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:09.640]  maybe it's me just not thinking through it enough. But it just, I've not seen one of these things with
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:18.520]  a good user experience that would stand out. Yeah. And I have a pebble, which it seems it's broadly
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:25.160]  similar. I mean that Google now stuff is a total difference and but I don't give Google my personal
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:30.120]  information. I don't I don't put my flight information into Google. It's always the demos are always
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:36.440]  about goddamn flights too. And it's like, you know, I've, you know, I don't know who if I've never
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:40.600]  had a flight on my watch before, but I've never missed a flight. So I don't know that that's how
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:47.640]  great a demo that is. Maybe I need that. But I've had a device paired with my phone that shows
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:53.000]  all notifications from my phone on my wrist and makes my wrist buzz when my phone gets a notification
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:12:00.600]  and it doesn't doesn't seem helpful at all. It doesn't, it doesn't good for me at all. I mean,
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:05.640]  I don't think this is going to be any more popular than pebble. I don't think just showing notifications
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:12.040]  on your wrist is useful. I do kind of like the idea of the whittings watch that you link to the
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:15.720]  other day. Right. The activity. I don't even know how you're supposed to say it. That's how I
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:20.840]  would have said it. The only thing I don't like about the thing is its name. But it's it's a nice
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:26.760]  look and watch. Right. It's not awful. Even the website, it's all attractive, fashionable people doing
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:30.680]  interesting things. And there's like the woman is even swimming on the thing. And as a wee bit of
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:39.000]  bluetooth and it does foot or distance tracking, I think it has a swim mode too. So you can, and I
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.840]  know that I think I've seen from other people who are activity trackers that swimming has always been
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:51.160]  a little difficult. So you look at it though. And it strikes you as it's it's not, I mean, there's
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:55.240]  no digital display. Right. It really is truly analog. But maybe that's a smarter idea. Maybe
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:12:58.440]  there's something to be done with that. Yeah, I don't know if it's good for everybody. Like to me,
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:04.040]  like I've said, I think it sells well as a typical $400 watch, which it in Apple's terms means
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:09.320]  not at all. But in terms of, you know, people who make watches could be a fine little side business,
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:13.640]  you know, is it a sort of thing that a hundred million people are going to buy? No. I don't
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:18.280]  think there's any chance of that. Is it something a couple of 10,000 people would buy? Sure.
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:22.440]  Well, it kind of makes me wonder because it's just, I mean, it's a watch and it's got that dial. And
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:28.840]  the dial is just the needle moves from zero to a hundred. And that's the kind of thing that anybody
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:34.200]  any watchmaker could add that feature. Yeah, I could see that becoming like a new,
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:41.080]  and you know, those sort of features becoming a bigger part of traditional watches I could be
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.560]  the next CMaster has that thing in it. Well, that would be to see like a Rolex would be different
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:51.080]  because a Rolex isn't electronic at all. That's to me, like a mechanical watch might be the cut
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:56.600]  out of all of this because there's no electronics at all, which is sort of the, the aesthetic
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:01.640]  beauty of a mechanical watch. But like the withings watch is a quartz watch and it takes a standard
[2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:09.080]  watch battery. But it has to be electronic to do any kind of bluetooth. Yeah, I haven't thought
[2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:14.040]  about that. But most of the watches most people buy in the world are quartz watches, not mechanical
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:19.640]  watches. So I still think that that the highest end, you know, the mechanical automatic watches
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:24.760]  are still not going to be part of this, but the vast majority of traditional watches are quartz
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:29.880]  and could be. I think it's time, but I think that's part of, I think the fact that it runs,
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:35.320]  it's advertised to run for a year on a standard watch battery is part of that whole,
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:39.800]  hey, design is how it works. Like not having to worry about the battery more than once a year
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:46.520]  is an enormous difference from the gear watches, which by all accounts so far, it need to be
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:52.920]  charged daily. Like asking someone to add another device that you have to charge every day
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:59.480]  is, I think it's an enormous barrier. And in some cases, a device that would take up
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:04.920]  another IP address. It might not matter for you or me at home, but for, for corporate types.
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:08.920]  Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't know. Did they need an IP address? I thought it was all bluetooth.
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:12.520]  Yeah, I think so. I don't know. I'm interested. I'm kind of like imagining future casting.
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:18.440]  Right. I think that we all blindly tolerate the fact that we have to charge our phones every day
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:24.360]  because the phones in, you know, are, we can't, none of us want to go back to pre iPhone
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:29.240]  smartphone life. It's worth it, even though it's an enormous hassle. Whereas at some point in
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:34.360]  the decades to come, maybe the decade to come, we're not going to have to charge our phone every day.
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:40.120]  And we're going to look back on the days when we'd go to the airport and everybody was fighting
[2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:45.320]  over electrical sockets and grown, grown men wearing suits are sitting on the floor of the airport
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:49.720]  so that they could be near a power charger because their phone was dead at three in the afternoon.
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:55.400]  We're going to look back and think, my God, we live like animals. Adding another device with that
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:16:02.440]  sort of constant need for charging is an enormous hassle. And it has to add to make it worthwhile
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:07.800]  that people would actually go through with it. It has to add a lot of utility, I think. Whereas,
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:12.520]  oh, I don't have to take my phone out of my pocket to see who just texted me. I can just
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:18.520]  look at my wrist to me doesn't cross that barrier. Doesn't even come close. And the best case
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:23.800]  scenario is not you making your flight. The best case scenario is not. I mean, even having maps
[2:16:23.800 --> 2:16:28.840]  data on your wrist isn't compelling enough. Taking my phone out of my pocket is not that hard.
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:33.160]  Right. I don't think that the difference between taking my phone out of my pocket
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:41.640]  versus flipping my wrist to be watch phase visible is that much of a difference. Yes, it is easier
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:46.520]  to look at my wrist. So, you know, and I do wear a regular wrist watch when I want to see what time
[2:16:46.520 --> 2:16:51.320]  it is. I do just look at my wrist. I don't take out my phone. But the difference isn't that great
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:56.280]  for most things. Like, it totally makes sense to me. It makes a lot of sense to me how an awful
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:01.800]  lot of people, especially as they skew younger, say, I don't understand why you'd want to wear a
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:07.080]  timepiece wrist watch. I just look at my phone. Like, it's not that big a difference. And that, to
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:12.120]  me, is the entire reason these things exist other than the fitness tracking, which there's a lot
[2:17:12.120 --> 2:17:18.600]  of awful, a lot more subtle solutions out there. Right. Somebody's wearing a Fitbit. You don't know
[2:17:18.600 --> 2:17:25.720]  it. Somebody's wearing a galaxy your live smartwatch and you know it because they've got a giant
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:30.440]  brick on the wrist. Well, if only they could put it on their face. So, I think these things are
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:35.240]  dead on arrival, going nowhere, and predict that whatever, if Apple has something
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:38.920]  wrist wearable to show this fall that it won't resemble these things at all.
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:44.040]  It's similar to the argument. Like, you saw the, I think you've been linked to it, the
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:48.840]  the daily show thing about the Google Glass Explorers. Yes.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:59.080]  The ability to access that information with Google Glass without looking away from the person,
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:03.960]  it's a similar argument to being able to see the time without taking your phone out of your
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:08.360]  pocket or to see your notifications without taking your phone out of your pocket. It takes a
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:12.760]  certain kind of person for that to be worthwhile. And it feels more like a thing we can do with
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:18.760]  technology rather than solving a real problem. Yeah, it doesn't seem, yeah, it just seems like
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:22.280]  you've solved a very, very small problem, which is that I don't want to take my phone out of my
[2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:26.760]  pocket. And you have to have your phone with you. You can't go out without the phone and still have
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:31.320]  a connection, because you're out of Bluetooth range. So you can't just go for a run and leave your
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:35.000]  phone at home and do all the things you could do on your phone because you've lost a connection.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:39.560]  It doesn't solve that, but like that would be a true, that would be a real problem yourself.
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:44.440]  But I think it's a social problem because the real thing you don't want to do is take your phone
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:48.360]  out to look at a notification when you're talking to somebody. So you're not, they're not solving
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:52.840]  that problem. They're just masking it. Yeah. And if you get, if you look at your watch and it's
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:56.840]  an important notification, you're going to have to do it anyway. Right. And if it's not an important
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:19:02.680]  notification, why are you getting a notification for it? And it doesn't, it at no point does it
[2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:06.040]  ever been polite to constantly check your watch when talking to somebody. One of the other things
[2:19:06.040 --> 2:19:09.960]  it just drives me nuts whenever I've tried Android is Android defaults to showing a lot more
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:15.640]  notifications and all notifications put an icon up in the status bar. And I noticed during IO,
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:21.640]  even in the demos that the cleaned up prepared demos for the software, the status bar was just
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:27.000]  chock full of notifications. You know, there's like three Gmail icons because you've got three
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:32.120]  new messages for Gmail. And it's like, I can't believe that it doesn't drive people nuts.
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:35.960]  It's like walking into somebody's house and they've, they're just some disorganized.
[2:19:35.960 --> 2:19:40.840]  They got stuff all over the place like dirty dishes out. Says I, as I look around my office.
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:46.680]  I've got like literally like 47 cardboard boxes from Amazon.
[2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:50.280]  But yeah, but if you're going to show pictures of your, your home, right, you've, you've,
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:57.560]  you've cleaned it up now. Well, we keep my office door closed. Yeah, I don't know. I can't
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:02.360]  help but think that it that this is going to be another one of those things where Apple shows
[2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:06.520]  a wrist wearable that looks nothing like these things does something different. And the other
[2:20:06.520 --> 2:20:10.760]  thing too, and that's just to tie it all up is go back seven years, celebrate the iPhone
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:15.080]  anniversary. The other thing about the original iPhone seven years ago is when they first
[2:20:15.080 --> 2:20:21.000]  shipped it or first showed it on stage, it seemed too good to be true. There was this and,
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:26.280]  and famously like rim had like a meeting the next day where they, they just, their conclusion was
[2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:31.080]  Apple is lying about the capabilities of this device because it can't do the things that they're
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:38.600]  saying it does in last all day. Right? There's nothing about these Google, uh, where are they
[2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:45.800]  Android where watches, even the, the Moto 320, um, that makes anybody say, I can't believe that
[2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:49.800]  they were able to build that this year. Well, it's, it doesn't help that they're sitting there
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:53.560]  telling everybody how it works. Like that's Google's whole thing is talking about, well, here's
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:58.120]  how we got this to get to the door. Yeah, but there's no aspect of the technology that, that,
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:04.360]  that is surprising or seems like, wow, that should, that seems like it's from the future.
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:11.000]  It's that sort of Android Google Linux philosophy thing. And anytime you see
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:18.920]  even, even the more popular Linux apps or, or the things that Google, it all has that air of
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:23.640]  people sitting around like a, like a modern day version of those electronics kits you could buy
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:28.280]  at Radio Shack. Like, here's the stuff and here's what we can do with the stuff. And now I
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:33.400]  made you a radio. Right, which is cool if it's a bunch of kids, you know, making a hobby type thing
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:40.680]  or a university project. Right. And is pointless if it's a major initiative from, you know,
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:46.120]  one of the 10 biggest corporations in the world that wants to make a product for a billion people.
[2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:51.240]  Right. Like, if I went over to Tish and there was a kid showing off a wearable that, that
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:56.600]  was like Google Glass, I'd be really impressed. Right. Or the same thing with these watches.
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:22:01.960]  Right. It would be very, very impressive. But I look at Google and like, I got, I got shit to do
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:05.400]  and I'm not wearing that. Right. They've presenting, they're presenting this as something that
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:11.240]  maybe millions of people will be buying for Christmas this year. And I think that it's not going to
[2:22:11.240 --> 2:22:16.200]  happen at all. I think Apple is either A, going to show nothing and they're not going to get into
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:20.360]  this or B, they're going to show something that's very different. And then all of a sudden next year's
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:26.840]  Google Android where watches will look an awful lot like the one that Apple unveiled at the end of
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:31.160]  2014. And then all the Google people are going to be like, yeah, but we've had, we had watches
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:36.200]  the year before too. No big deal. Just because ours totally changed in the next year and happened
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:40.200]  to change in a way that was exactly like the Apple one. There was always going to get there. Right.
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:45.720]  This was just the nature of it. It's funny, before the iPhone came out, there was all the rumors
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:51.960]  about an Apple phone and iPhone, they weren't close to the mark and that nobody guessed it.
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:58.840]  But there was a lot of imagination. People, you look at all these mock ups, these fake phones
[2:22:58.840 --> 2:23:04.840]  that people put together in Photoshop and in 3D rendering software. And people were, people had a
[2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:11.240]  lot of interesting ideas of how Apple might do a phone. There's nothing like that for a watch.
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:16.680]  No. Well, and well, the other thing, no, too. Well, again, I think that watches the wrong
[2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:20.760]  way to look at it, but there might be something like that for what you could wear on your wrist.
[2:23:21.480 --> 2:23:26.840]  I don't know. I hope Apple has something to show because I think if they do, it's going to be
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:33.080]  really interesting and thoughtful. And I think it's going to, by necessity, push the boundaries of what
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:39.160]  we consider technically possible. And there's nothing about that with the Google Wear stuff.
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  Yeah, it doesn't feel like magic at all. No, it just feels like, well, it seems like, you know,
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:50.920]  by now you ought to be able to make the equivalent of a 200, you know, an iPod Nano with Bluetooth.
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:56.760]  Right. As of today, I am not excited at all about Apple making the wearable
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:03.720]  thing that I put on my wrist. If they do what I hope that in true Apple style, it'll be
[2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:10.040]  suddenly I'll be salivating over the thing. Yeah. Well, my optimism is because not because I have a
[2:24:10.040 --> 2:24:14.120]  good imagination of what it would do because I don't, I'm with you on that. I can't imagine what
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:17.880]  they would make that would make me want to wear it. But my, it's my confidence that they're only
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:22.440]  going to ship something if they have an answer to that question that I just haven't thought about.
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:27.400]  Because I honestly, the big difference from 2007 is I, the reason I was blown away is I really,
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:32.680]  I would have considered impossible before the keynote to have a quote unquote,
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:37.400]  stripped down version of OS 10 running on a phone. If somebody would have said to me before,
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:40.920]  here's what I think they're going to do is they're going to show they're going to have an iPhone and
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:45.320]  it's going to run like a stripped down version of iOS 10 for touch screens. And I would have,
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:49.880]  my response would have been, well, that's not possible yet. Maybe in the future, but not yet,
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:54.680]  they can't do that yet. Yeah, I would have agreed with that. So I think that whatever Apple's
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:24:59.160]  going to have for your wrist is going to be that sort of thing. I didn't think that was possible yet,
[2:24:59.160 --> 2:25:02.920]  but here it is. I think that that's really going to come down to battery. I think that's
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:07.800]  happy to be the big shot. Well, and that's why I think that the weird thing, I think that the focus on
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:16.920]  iPhone and Android style LCD displays in the Android where is, I wouldn't be surprised at all if
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:21.000]  that's the biggest reason they only get one day of battery life is because it's got it because
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.400]  the display takes so much of the battery, you know, like I said with Jonas before, like his,
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:29.400]  he gets terrible battery life because he runs a full brightness. The display is still it's just an
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:33.800]  enormous and enormous drain. It didn't Steve Jobs say that at one point that the biggest drain
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:38.680]  on battery in the iPhone was the display. Yeah, it's like an open secret. I mean, it's just simple,
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.200]  you know, it's just lighting up millions of little light bulbs. This is why I think that
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:50.600]  withings, activity, steampunk approaches, pretty smart. Yeah, I don't, I would actually, I'll just go
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:55.800]  as far as to say, I think I'd be very surprised if Apple's wearable is an iPhone-style display on your
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:00.680]  wrist. I don't know if it'll be no display. I don't know if it's like a thing that just collects
[2:26:00.680 --> 2:26:05.720]  data. But I don't, I just don't see how running a display and therefore only getting one day of
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.760]  battery life, anything desirable comes out of that. Yeah, I don't know. All right, I think we're
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:18.280]  filled up the hour. It's wrap it up. Dave Whiskus, people can can find you on Twitter at what
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:26.120]  you're username this week at D. Whiskus D. Whiskus and you got your own professional with Jamie
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:38.680]  Newberry. And what's that app? Oh, um, that's for that's it. Yeah. I like that. I like that app.
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:47.480]  People can check that out. It's on sale for the summer at $299. And I think thanks to you.
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:52.920]  You said for the summer, but what you wrote was until we sober up until we sober up.
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:58.920]  Well, we'll see how that goes. Let's see how it goes. All right, I'll send you the audio and then you can get to work.
