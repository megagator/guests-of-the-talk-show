[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  you've got a bigger role on the show i don't we've never really talked about it but you now have
[00:04.480 --> 00:09.840]  significantly i mean second to me maybe even more than me a bigger role on on the show
[00:11.120 --> 00:14.480]  i got to tell you the uh the editing on your show lately has been outstanding
[00:15.760 --> 00:21.040]  so dave whiskus now does the editing of the show i don't we actually were just talking about this
[00:21.040 --> 00:25.280]  the other day i've actually never listened to a complete episode of the talk show i don't think
[00:25.280 --> 00:31.200]  i have either well when i'm doing the edit sometimes i'm just looking for uh you know
[00:31.200 --> 00:34.960]  where things overlap so i mean i've listened to the whole thing but when i'm doing like the
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.760]  editing part i'm just looking for it's it's kind of like uh looking at the matrix how long does
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.440]  it take you to edit an episode uh of the talk show uh like a two-hour episode will take about
[00:45.440 --> 00:53.440]  two hours in real time yeah about yeah i think most people seem to say it takes usually about
[00:53.440 --> 01:00.080]  1.5 x i think marco seems to say it takes him around three hours for for an atp well that's if
[01:00.080 --> 01:04.880]  the show is more than two people a two-person show is pretty easy to edit because things don't
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.080]  you don't you don't ever run into a situation where three people are trying to talk at the
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.360]  same time all right yeah that's it probably the biggest problem right is when you have because
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.160]  you're you're unprofessional always has three people because it's you and jamie and a guest
[01:18.160 --> 01:22.640]  at least my guest yeah and so i pretty much have to listen to the show like every second of the
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.560]  audio to make sure that things are right and it's sometimes people will monologue a little
[01:26.560 --> 01:31.840]  bit and that gives me a chance to you know skip ahead a couple of seconds because it's not like
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.760]  i'm listening to make sure that they're i mean i was there i know what they said so i don't have
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.440]  to worry about content i'm more listening for audio and when things overlap and making sure
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.160]  there's not weird background noise and stuff like that and crosstalk is not is is a big problem
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.880]  with three people yeah and it's it's you know some one person will stop talking and then the
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.600]  other two might go to say something and you get that that handshake thing of oh no sorry go ahead
[01:53.600 --> 02:00.320]  no you go ahead it's weird i'm i'm in a weird position that i am well i'm not on that i don't
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.080]  listen to that many podcasts i'm trying to listen to more but my my my percentage of my average
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.480]  week that i'm recording a podcast is pretty close to the percentage of a week that i listen to
[02:10.480 --> 02:18.400]  podcasts um so i'm like very very close to being you know recording as many podcasts as i listen
[02:18.400 --> 02:23.520]  to at least time wise because i can listen to more than i record because you can listen at like 1.5x
[02:24.400 --> 02:30.080]  um and whenever i'm on a show especially not this show but like a special guest on some other show
[02:30.080 --> 02:36.320]  like with um you know like with renee and guy on debug uh like we were a couple weeks ago yeah
[02:36.320 --> 02:44.400]  uh when we're recording the crosstalk always gets to me and and i think oh that was horrible i tried
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.040]  to say something and clearly it was like the second or so of latency with skype and somebody
[02:49.040 --> 02:56.240]  else had already started talking and it is very difficult to auto career to for the guests to auto
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.480]  correct that like you would in real life if we were recording around the table you can make eye
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.400]  contact like hey i've raised your finger i've got a point to make um but once it starts on a skype
[03:06.400 --> 03:12.160]  recorded show it seems like everybody wants to be polite and stop but then that's you know what i
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.680]  mean yeah and it seems like this could be solved with software either i guess there's an argument
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.240]  to be made for if everybody just does skype video then you're looking at each other but even that
[03:22.240 --> 03:26.240]  doesn't quite cover no you may you need like uh i guess you could you could do a thing where
[03:26.240 --> 03:29.920]  somebody clicks a button and they raise their hand like webex at this but you're not you're
[03:29.920 --> 03:33.760]  not really looking at each other with the webcam you're looking at the camera and everybody who
[03:33.760 --> 03:39.120]  looks at your video feed sees you the same way as opposed to you know if you're literally around
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.680]  the table and you're talking i can specifically point to you and be like you know i've got
[03:45.680 --> 03:50.480]  something to add to this yeah it's never going to be the same as it is sitting around the table
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.520]  yeah and it always shows too because i know i i remember thinking it was a strikingly good podcast
[03:57.520 --> 04:04.080]  was the um the episode of debug i think it was debug i hope the guy and renee have so many goddamn
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.680]  shows but it was the one that they were they recorded it the day after the wwdc keynote or
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.000]  maybe it was the day of i don't know but it was they but they went to macworld's office and used
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.640]  borrowed macworld's um you know podcast studio yeah and they had so many guests they had like
[04:20.640 --> 04:23.600]  i don't know there's like six or seven people i thought this is gonna be a mess even though
[04:23.600 --> 04:32.080]  it was a bunch of really smart people uh you know it's uh ryan uh ryan nelson ryan nelson was on
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.280]  drance was on um you know it was more than that i forget how many but it was great and i just
[04:37.280 --> 04:40.560]  thought this is going to be crazy they're going to be cross-talking all over each other but because
[04:40.560 --> 04:47.920]  they were in the same room it was actually remarkably uh well organized modified by the fact
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.680]  that guy and renee and then ryan and rance are just the nicest people and nobody's going to try
[04:53.680 --> 04:59.040]  to be a jerk in that room right so you edit the podcast now you're doing the editing for
[04:59.040 --> 05:05.920]  the talk show um how's that going i mean it's it's editing i kind of like it it forces me to
[05:05.920 --> 05:09.920]  listen to the show and it forces me to listen to the show in a different way like you i don't spend
[05:09.920 --> 05:12.800]  a ton of time listening to podcasts and it's not that i don't want to it's that i don't have a
[05:12.800 --> 05:19.040]  commute so i don't have like that time every day where i that would be my habit so having having
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.120]  somebody else's show to edit because i've you know i edit unprofessional i've done that for almost two
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.920]  years i edit the tv show the thing that i do with renee uh but that's like i was there during
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.400]  recording so it's not the same kind of listening so it's interesting to listen and try to make
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.720]  editorial choices while it goes rather than like having a list in my head of things i just need to
[05:36.720 --> 05:42.480]  knock out and then the other thing you're doing should we talk about the standard uh we can yeah
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.320]  i mean it's weird like it's not a secret but we haven't really talked about it is you're also
[05:46.320 --> 05:51.040]  um handling the sponsorships for the show like when people want to sponsor this show they're
[05:51.040 --> 05:56.800]  really they're going to be getting in contact with you right but it's like it's weird it's we're
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.360]  sort of uh maybe it's probably all my fault where the transition the transition from mule
[06:01.360 --> 06:08.240]  to hosting an endearing fireball was sort of one weird thing at a time uh and now it's like we're
[06:08.240 --> 06:12.640]  up off the air and it's working and nobody's complaining at all i don't think we've had any
[06:12.640 --> 06:18.080]  complaints so it seems like the feed keeps working you know soundcloud for hosting has
[06:18.080 --> 06:23.920]  worked just fine nobody really seems to have missed a beat the download numbers are completely
[06:23.920 --> 06:30.080]  on par with where they were i'll say this about editing uh it's forced me to really evaluate audio
[06:30.080 --> 06:33.600]  quality because you know if your people more people listen to your show than listen to my show
[06:33.600 --> 06:38.560]  and so suddenly i have to care about uh how how well encoded an mp3 is i've changed my workflow
[06:38.560 --> 06:47.040]  there um why do you why do you use mp3 instead of aac uh you know i i don't know i never really
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.600]  thought about it i my assumption is that uh mp3 is gonna be the thing that the most people would
[06:51.600 --> 06:56.000]  be able to play yeah that's what i would think too that's why i've always gone with that actually
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.040]  i guess i didn't choose with mule that when i was with mule that was i just sent them audio
[07:03.040 --> 07:07.440]  and then the podcast went up and there was no choice but they but they you know the show's been
[07:07.440 --> 07:15.040]  mp3 as long as i can remember i think atp though is aac that wouldn't surprise me that sounds like
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.280]  a marco thing to do yeah it seems like something i would do too i don't know i would be very
[07:19.280 --> 07:24.160]  surprised if the percentage of people who listen to the talk show who would have a problem if i
[07:24.160 --> 07:30.400]  switched from mp3 to aac if that was more than one percent i mean we could certainly try it
[07:30.400 --> 07:38.480]  what's the point i kind of feel like mp3 is the one that's also going to be most likely to be
[07:38.480 --> 07:44.720]  listening listenable to 100 years from now well mp3 is like its own brand people know what an mp3
[07:44.720 --> 07:50.800]  is even non-computer people know what an mp3 is yeah aac might have some technical you know
[07:51.440 --> 07:56.160]  improvements we're at the same and this uses like the sort of stupid thing we used to argue about
[07:56.160 --> 08:01.680]  10 years ago we're at the same bit rate you know you can fit a couple you know 20 more songs
[08:01.680 --> 08:05.840]  but now it's like nobody you know nobody cares about that like that was like the whole point was
[08:05.840 --> 08:11.920]  that at a certain point when the ipod switched from mp3 to ar or added aac support and the
[08:11.920 --> 08:18.400]  support and the itune store was using aac they went from like like five gigabytes was what you
[08:18.400 --> 08:24.960]  needed for a thousand songs to four gigabytes because the same quality by somebody's you know
[08:24.960 --> 08:31.760]  clearly subjective measurement you know you could have the same quality of audio and and save 20
[08:31.760 --> 08:38.160]  on storage it might matter a little bit more because the a podcast is a lot longer than a song
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.280]  and people are downloading these things nowadays mostly over the air right and people want to in
[08:43.280 --> 08:48.240]  a lot of cases download them over cellular right it's like all the podcast clients have to
[08:49.120 --> 08:56.880]  negotiate a sort of tricky set of you know uh preferences and manual controls so that
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.680]  you're not downloading over cellular without knowing that you're doing it because you could
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.640]  blow right through a data cap easily yeah and that would be uh that'd be a rude awakening to
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.680]  find out that you've run out of data and it's all you know right overcast right and you know and
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.640]  you go overseas or something like that and the data cap might be a expensive and be very small
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.000]  right like 50 bucks for 250 megabytes well that might be the whole you know you you know one
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.400]  episode of the show might be 250 megabytes yeah that would kill me every time but you want to
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.720]  enable it because some people do want that some people might have if you have an eight gigabyte
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.880]  verizon monthly plan you might want to download your you know you just you know you really might
[09:38.880 --> 09:44.480]  there are some people who really do want the iphone to just treat wi-fi and cellular identically
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.720]  yeah i've i've never when i'm at home come anywhere near hitting the cap on my data plan
[09:48.720 --> 09:55.440]  but when i travel i'm i i've got verizon and it does that thing after uh after 100 megs or
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.320]  something like that or one i forget what it is it it charges you another 25 dollars and i just
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.160]  i've if i'm gone for two weeks i've spent like two three hundred dollars on data
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.400]  yeah i've i've spent a lot when i travel um although i don't think i spent that much when
[10:10.400 --> 10:15.920]  i was in ireland well because we were at the hotel the whole time and there was always wi-fi
[10:15.920 --> 10:20.640]  yeah maybe that was it uh although now that i mentioned this to you and now i'm making a note
[10:20.640 --> 10:28.160]  to myself i i don't think i did the thing i was supposed to do which was uh and i do this every
[10:28.160 --> 10:38.560]  time is i go to verizon before i go over out of the country and i add to my plan the 250 megabytes
[10:38.560 --> 10:44.080]  for 20 bucks thing for international data but then you're like a month later when your next bill
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.280]  comes you've got to go on and turn it off otherwise you're paying for it every month yeah i may or may
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.160]  not have just paid for it in may and june i just got my bill a few days ago and i saw that it was
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.240]  still on there from april or whenever we were there damn because it's funny because you're
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.480]  used to i know last year at all i did the thing you ever do the thing where you get the temporary
[11:04.480 --> 11:10.880]  sim card because you go to uh the amsterdam too right what do you do when you go over there do
[11:10.880 --> 11:14.800]  you do the sim card thing or do you just pay verizon uh when i was living there what i did
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.560]  was i went to the uh the t-mobile store and it's like 10 10 euros or something for uh for one gig
[11:20.560 --> 11:25.600]  of data and that's ends up being pretty cheap and you can run on a gig for about a month
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.560]  of just you know normal daily like checking twitter and stuff like that so i just i used
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.680]  a t-mobile sim when i was over there for a longer term if it's just going to be a week or something
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.800]  i'll stick with verizon and deal with the uh ridiculous data charges yeah the i message the
[11:40.800 --> 11:47.760]  way that i messaged bridges sms though is it gets screwy when you change your phone number with which
[11:47.760 --> 11:53.520]  is implicit with putting a temporary sim card in right suddenly those messages that should be going
[11:53.520 --> 11:59.760]  to your phone number are now going who knows where right and you might be sending messages from a
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.640]  phone number that you don't want people to ever send to again in the future and right and you can
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.320]  there's you know you can usually usually when i'm sending to somebody who i know has i messaged i
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.360]  prefer to send address it to their email address rather than their phone number because i feel like
[12:15.360 --> 12:22.720]  it's more permanent but i i don't know i just remember that the year before at all i ran into
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.600]  all sorts of it was great price wise getting a temporary sim card it was like more data than i
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.960]  could use while i was in ireland for a very very reasonable price but it was very confusing i
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.640]  message wise it's a it's a big hassle my when i was living over in amsterdam my uh my nightly
[12:38.640 --> 12:44.960]  ritual my routine was that when i get home i would pop the sim out put my old sim in and give it five
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.280]  minutes to see if any messages came in or if i got any voicemails and then swap them back i don't i
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.760]  don't know what to suggest to apple because it's such a weird edge case and i don't want to suggest
[12:53.760 --> 13:00.560]  but i want somehow to be able to tell the iphone use this sim card only for data you know and then
[13:00.560 --> 13:06.000]  just keep using my number yeah like like this is not a phone number just use this sim card for data
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.480]  like it's it's somehow it that's the edge case where the way that we as a technical culture have
[13:12.480 --> 13:20.400]  conflated the legacy telephone network where you have this unique worldwide unique phone number
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.920]  with just give me internet which is really all i want i have no desire whatsoever zero
[13:27.920 --> 13:34.640]  ever to use the actual phone or text messaging with a temporary sim card all i want is ip
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.360]  networking and there's but there's no way to tell the iphone net it seems like i don't know if this
[13:39.360 --> 13:46.320]  is ios 7 ios 8 but lately when i when i have to do something like that it still says my phone number
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.120]  so i don't know if maybe they've changed it to where the phone number can linger even if you
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.080]  get rid of your sim how does it work with the ipad when you have a cellular ipad you do have a phone
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.720]  number like and it says it like when you go into your settings to deal with you know whichever
[14:00.720 --> 14:06.000]  carrier it is that you have it tells you a phone yeah your sim card for an ipad has a phone number
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.640]  but i don't think you can ever receive text messages at that number no i can't imagine
[14:12.640 --> 14:19.280]  that's probably just like a like a i don't know a function of it being a sim card so i i don't know
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.000]  i guess it's not that confusing i guess so i guess what i want is a way to tell an iphone to go into
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.680]  ipad mode and treat this use this sim card only for data there's also an argument to be made for
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.640]  give me two sim slots yeah but that's confusing though because i don't want people sending me text
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.120]  messages while i'm out of the country you know because it's you you i don't know it's not that
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.800]  much money but it's you know i don't know it's annoying if somebody who actually has like an
[14:44.800 --> 14:47.840]  android phone sends you a text because they don't know you're out of the country and you paid two
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.200]  dollars just to receive it that's what you get for talking to those people anyway anyway back
[14:53.200 --> 14:59.200]  to the the meta talk about the show so so one reason i've never come up you know that you're
[14:59.200 --> 15:07.120]  now selling this the show the sponsorships for this show and your show and uh brent's and and
[15:07.120 --> 15:12.160]  chris parris's show i've never had reason to bring it up is that this show's sponsorships have been
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.120]  sold out for a while and they're still sold out i think they're like we're recording right now on
[15:17.120 --> 15:23.120]  june 30 and they're sold out through august right uh yeah and not there's nothing open until the
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.640]  last week of august uh so there's been no reason to publicize it but for anybody who's curious
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.000]  who's curious if you're out there you listened i've never had to bring this up before because
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.200]  it's like the show's you know been lucky enough that it's been sold out and we have so many repeat
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.560]  sponsors who keep buying up spots but anybody who's ever been curious if you have like a product
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.840]  or something you thought maybe i should sponsor the talk show you can go to um standard that's
[15:49.840 --> 15:57.120]  what we're calling it standard.fm is the website yeah go to standard.fm and go from there and then
[15:57.120 --> 16:01.120]  you can figure out how to sponsor the show yeah it pretty much just ends with people emailing me
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.360]  not a podcast network no no we're very careful about that there's i think there's so much
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.400]  discussion going into this about how can we do this without being another podcast now right
[16:12.400 --> 16:18.880]  it's just a way to it's like the one aspect of a podcast network that that we wanted which is
[16:19.840 --> 16:26.560]  that it's way less work for one person to sell sponsorships for multiple shows than it is for
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.920]  each show to book their own sponsorships but really what it came down to is i realized with
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.040]  me having to sell my own spots for unprofessional it just made sense and you were going to be
[16:37.040 --> 16:43.120]  leaving mule and and uh everybody had this this one problem like all of us that are present we
[16:43.120 --> 16:47.200]  all had the same problem it's like well you know what if i'm doing it for mine would it be easier
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.240]  it probably would be easier if i if i could go to sponsors and say well you know we're we're a group
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.960]  and maybe we could make other things happen yeah it's just a lot i don't know some it's one of
[16:56.960 --> 17:03.040]  those things where that a little bit of collectivism saves a lot of work yeah and i mean there's a a
[17:03.040 --> 17:09.360]  sort of tangible benefit to cube ranch too where i if if brent is working on code and not worrying
[17:09.360 --> 17:14.080]  about how he's going to sell sponsorship for his podcast or his website then that's an upside for
[17:14.080 --> 17:22.880]  us i never thought of that uh let me take that moment and thank our first sponsor it's our good
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.800]  friends speaking of repeat sponsors our good friends at warby parker uh warby parker was
[17:28.800 --> 17:34.480]  founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective to create boutique quality classically
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.160]  crafted eyewear at a revolutionary price point that's what they said i say go to warby parker
[17:40.160 --> 17:46.960]  and you can get really cool eyeglasses at way less than what you would pay at most retail i
[17:46.960 --> 17:53.040]  boutique places and at the cheap i boutique places you're not going to get glasses that look as cool
[17:53.040 --> 18:00.240]  as warby parker's um it's that simple really they should not cost as much as an iphone
[18:00.240 --> 18:06.320]  prescription glasses at warby parker start at 95 bucks including the prescription lenses uh they
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.440]  have a titanium collection that starts at 145 now if you've gone shopping for eyeglasses recently you
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.600]  know those prices are way way less than that uh they don't jerk you around with upsells on all
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.720]  the stuff you'd want anyway like anti-reflective anti-glare coating that just comes because who
[18:22.720 --> 18:28.880]  doesn't want that who wants glare and reflections on their glasses can i have the easily scratched
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.000]  lenses please give me the glasses that are made out of that plastic that they made the first ipad
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.880]  nanos out of where if you look at it funny they get scratched no of course not you want all the
[18:38.880 --> 18:45.920]  good stuff um and this is the thing and i you guys have heard this before but it really works you
[18:45.920 --> 18:49.760]  think well wait i do care about what my glasses look like i care because they're going to be
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.840]  right on my face i don't know how can i buy these things over the internet and get a pair of glasses
[18:55.840 --> 19:00.000]  that are going to look good on me because you know you might see a pair on the web page think well
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.760]  that looks cool but you don't know if it looks good on you well they've got a couple of things
[19:03.760 --> 19:09.200]  they've got like a webcam type thing where you can uh and it works pretty amazingly well where
[19:09.200 --> 19:13.920]  you just snap a picture of yourself in front of the webcam and then they they measure the stuff
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.240]  like your your nose and your eye distance and yeah and you pick a pair of glasses and they like you
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.800]  know impose them over your face but the other thing they have and this is the bigger deal is
[19:24.800 --> 19:31.120]  that they have this try at home thing you pick five pairs that you like they send them to you
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.440]  without the prescription lenses or anything you get a nice little box open it up there they are
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.400]  there's your five glasses you can take them out try them on compare them against each other um
[19:40.400 --> 19:44.560]  already with a label to ship it right back to them if you like one of them you can just order
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.480]  right there say this is the one i like give me this one then they send it to you you put the five
[19:48.480 --> 19:54.560]  samples back in box it up there's already a label send it right back to them couldn't be easier um
[19:54.560 --> 19:59.760]  we just did it here my wife just got a pair of sunglasses from warby parker uh everything
[19:59.760 --> 20:06.560]  it was exactly as described she got five pairs in a box she picked the one she liked the most
[20:06.560 --> 20:11.200]  and like literally a couple days later there they are with her prescription lenses couldn't be
[20:11.200 --> 20:16.400]  easier um really really happy and if anything she's pickier than i am about buying stuff like that
[20:16.400 --> 20:21.680]  it's a pretty brilliant setup yeah it really is and and i think it's no surprise that um
[20:22.240 --> 20:26.080]  so many people i know so many people who have glasses from them and i've never heard anybody
[20:26.080 --> 20:29.920]  who said boy you know i kind of regret it everybody's really really happy with it so
[20:29.920 --> 20:36.480]  where do you go to find out more easy warby parker dot com slash the talk show warby parker dot com
[20:36.480 --> 20:42.800]  slash the talk show uh recommend them very highly go check them out do those work with google glass
[20:43.840 --> 20:48.400]  uh you know they're i don't think they do yet but you you joke uh they were mentioned though
[20:48.400 --> 20:53.280]  at some point like a year ago they were mentioned as a partner that was helping to
[20:53.280 --> 21:00.000]  a partner that was helping to prettify you know stylize google glass i i don't know if that fell
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.960]  through or if it's still coming well there was though last week the key i fired from the song
[21:04.960 --> 21:11.040]  who was it uh it's some fashion brand that i don't i can't recall off the top of my head that um
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.400]  that did release a bunch of designer frames for google glass
[21:18.400 --> 21:28.720]  uh i can't remember diane something was it diane oh um it's a fastenberg yeah something like that
[21:28.720 --> 21:38.080]  it's that's close enough uh and you know they just look really really like google glass there's
[21:38.080 --> 21:41.520]  everything wrong with there's nothing you can do about it right i mean when you have like a
[21:41.520 --> 21:47.120]  two inch by one inch battery pack behind your right ear you know there's there's just not
[21:47.120 --> 21:51.120]  much you can do with it it looks like you're wearing google glass or you have a like a hearing
[21:51.120 --> 21:56.800]  problem i guess uh you i would argue that i hope that google glass always looks like google glass
[21:56.800 --> 22:02.880]  so i can spot it yeah you know what that's it's a complicated thing i've talked about this with
[22:02.880 --> 22:07.440]  people on the show before where let's face it though that's not going to happen right like
[22:07.440 --> 22:15.760]  like it just in terms of of being a technical demo google glass is is you know in the grand
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.480]  scheme of technology it is you know it's amazing it's like jet you know jet packs and flying cars
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.880]  it's something you've always thought about as a kid is you could put a heads-up display in front
[22:24.880 --> 22:31.440]  of your eyes in real life and it's you know in the grand scheme of things pretty small in in
[22:31.440 --> 22:36.720]  real world practical use it's nowhere near small enough to be unnoticeable but if that's where we
[22:36.720 --> 22:42.720]  are today in 2014 or where we were in 2012 i guess when glass came out you know i don't think it's
[22:42.720 --> 22:48.240]  going to be shocking if 10 years from now you can make a pair of google glass that doesn't look
[22:48.240 --> 22:54.880]  different from a pair of regular eyeglasses oh i'm sure you know i mean look at how how how much
[22:54.880 --> 23:01.920]  smaller cameras have gotten i mean the camera seems like it's probably the easier part to to
[23:01.920 --> 23:07.920]  make indistinguishable to somehow hide in the frame of the glasses yeah i think really it comes
[23:07.920 --> 23:12.240]  down to the the battery because like even the heads up the display part there's other things
[23:12.240 --> 23:19.040]  they can do to uh either build that into your your eyeglass lens or um i build it into the frame so
[23:19.040 --> 23:24.480]  like the like what they do in cars for the for the hud yeah like a weird projection something yeah i
[23:24.480 --> 23:30.720]  agree the battery is probably a bigger uh a bigger challenge and the display part i don't know
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.280]  somehow they'll figure out a way to make it so that it's it's integrated in the lens as opposed
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.600]  to a weird thing sticking out over the lens and you know it's going to be a weird thing when you
[23:41.600 --> 23:48.640]  don't know whether people are recording you or not i mean i mean that but that's a i i'm i think
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.040]  you're i think it's foolish to think that we're not going to have to deal with that in our
[23:53.040 --> 24:00.320]  lifetimes i mean it's agreed clearly coming um is it is it maybe that uh we're old fuddy duddies and
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.760]  we came from an era before this and it's going to be just like uh i don't know the cctv camera at
[24:05.760 --> 24:10.160]  the gas station where we don't think about that we don't feel like that's an invasion of privacy maybe
[24:10.160 --> 24:13.920]  a kid born today by the time they're old enough they're never going to think of something like
[24:13.920 --> 24:19.280]  google glass as being invasive yeah i think it's just those yeah i think it's something like that
[24:19.280 --> 24:27.520]  where it it it just becomes part of the world around you and you accept you have to accept it
[24:27.520 --> 24:33.200]  because you don't have a choice you know i think that if you went back 30 or 40 years and told
[24:33.200 --> 24:39.360]  people about a world where everybody can send and receive phone calls anywhere they are at any point
[24:39.360 --> 24:46.160]  at dinner in their car uh anywhere you can just always be reached your phone is can ring at any
[24:46.160 --> 24:49.680]  time and you can always call someone at any time and that you know you'll go out to dinner and
[24:49.680 --> 24:55.600]  there'll be people talking on the phone at tables near you they would say that sounds at i would
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.840]  think that they would have a similar reaction to the way that like i feel about people being able
[25:01.840 --> 25:08.400]  to record me at any time yeah yeah probably or i think you know if a version of me that would have
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.360]  been my age now then would probably have an anxiety attack at the thought of that yeah it's
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.400]  you know it's unappealing and i said but i'm a person who thinks it's relatively unappealing to
[25:18.400 --> 25:25.360]  get phone calls at any time you know i mean i tend to not answer my phone usually so and i don't get
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.240]  that many phone calls period anyway you're not a you're not a phone person no not really and even
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.160]  someone who i want to talk to like my dad calls me and i like to talk to my dad a couple times a week
[25:34.160 --> 25:40.320]  and talk about baseball or whatever but if i'm like out if i'm like you know waiting in line at
[25:40.320 --> 25:45.440]  the supermarket to pay and my dad calls me i'll just you know send it right to voicemail and call
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.080]  them when i get home like it drives i think it's crazy when people do things like pick up the phone
[25:50.080 --> 25:56.000]  when you know for for something that's not immediate you know like if you know you're if
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.600]  you get a call from your kid's school well you want to answer that right away because who knows
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.080]  maybe it's an emergency but if it's you know just my dad calling i mean why would i do take that
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.480]  phone call in the supermarket it's the one that kills me is the people who will answer the phone
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.360]  when they're in the passenger seat of a car i don't know if i've ever seen that oh it's it's
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.760]  just rude because if you're the driver you're you're now trapped in a situation where you're
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.360]  you're somebody's chauffeur and you're listening to one half of a conversation yeah i see what you
[26:21.360 --> 26:27.120]  mean yeah that is weird yeah or like you know people are out to you know it's like a table
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.400]  for four at a restaurant and somebody just answers like a random phone call and starts talking it
[26:32.400 --> 26:38.240]  just seems very strange to me yeah but you'll you'll watch a baseball game at dinner yeah but
[26:38.240 --> 26:44.720]  i don't turn the volume up you don't you don't think there's a similar sort of thing happening
[26:44.720 --> 26:49.600]  there where there's i don't know there's the the rudeness of causing noise to disturb other people
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.400]  and then there's the uh how how engaged are you with the people around you yeah i sound like i'm
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.840]  criticizing you it's well no it's point taken you know it's probably not not the most polite thing
[26:59.840 --> 27:04.720]  that i do i don't do it all the time no no and i don't think it's really that different from
[27:04.720 --> 27:10.880]  somebody checking twitter at the table or whatever it's it's it's it's all on a spectrum though and
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.480]  in a way and and if you went back and talked about it you know go back 20 30 years it all seems pretty
[27:16.480 --> 27:24.480]  rude and uh you know that the devices are are drawing more attention than than other people
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.280]  around us i think the the baseball thing it's a comical example of something that we all do
[27:29.280 --> 27:34.400]  we'll all check our phone even if it's just a my my phone buzzed in my pocket and i'll excuse
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.560]  myself for a second even at my most polite i'm still ignoring somebody for a minute while i look
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.440]  at my phone yeah and we're all a little hypocritical about it where the things that we love most about
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.160]  what our phones let us do we think are okay and the things we don't care about are rude so i don't
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.320]  like talking on the phone i don't get many phone calls so i'll blather on about how rude it is that
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.840]  people will talk on the phone but i love watching the yankees and so you know i think being able to
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.600]  watch a yankees game while i eat dinner is is amazing technology so i admit that but i admit i
[28:03.600 --> 28:08.400]  have the self-awareness to admit that i'm i'm being a hypocrite to to present it that way i
[28:08.400 --> 28:15.120]  wish that a verizon would give me a zero minutes plan or like a 30 minutes plan i use about 30
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.680]  phone minutes a month i would happily pay less i don't even know what we use i guess we use a lot
[28:19.680 --> 28:23.200]  because we have like a shared pool and amy speaks on the phone a little bit more than me but we i
[28:23.200 --> 28:28.880]  don't think we come even close to using all the minutes i i think that the i we're at the point
[28:28.880 --> 28:35.200]  even though even if amy uses her phone a lot more than me we're not even close to using and you know
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.960]  what they give us it's crazy that they still measure by minutes i yeah like aol yeah i mean
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.560]  does anybody does there anybody who needs like extra minutes i guess there's some people who
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.400]  have a job that they're really truly on the phone all the time you know i would have met you know
[28:48.400 --> 28:54.000]  like real estate agents or something like that you know that some jobs you really are on your cell
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.520]  phone making phone calls all day every day but i don't know do they do they have to pay extra for
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.560]  that it just seems like everybody has unlimited plans now yeah it seems like some people have the
[29:04.560 --> 29:11.040]  the like it's you know 100 just for the phone part of it or something uh but you get effectively or
[29:11.040 --> 29:17.520]  literally unlimited talk time it why not make that the standard i don't know yeah maybe it's just a
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.160]  like a holdover from the fact that they're kind of a they're in they're moving into just being
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.120]  a dumb carrier at this point speaking of of rude and callous behavior did you see this thing you
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.080]  had to have seen it the the it came out over the weekend that facebook had been running
[29:32.080 --> 29:37.680]  a psychological experiment where they they took a six hundred thousand or seven hundred thousand
[29:37.680 --> 29:44.880]  users and half of them they randomly tried to algorithmically make their feed a little happier
[29:44.880 --> 29:51.920]  and the other half they tried to make it a little sadder and then tried to measure with like certain
[29:51.920 --> 29:59.120]  keywords like for the remainder of the week were the things that those people those two pools
[29:59.120 --> 30:04.800]  posted a little did it indicate that they were in better or worse moods and the answer was yes
[30:04.800 --> 30:09.280]  that that it actually did seem to have some sort of effect on their mood that the people whose
[30:09.920 --> 30:14.720]  feed was diddled to make them happier seemed to be happier and the ones who were diddled to
[30:18.320 --> 30:26.000]  well and i i i mean this since i've gotten some feedback on twitter and um an email from people
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.320]  saying that it's it's not helpful for me to say uh i my my the gist of my response is i'm surprised
[30:32.320 --> 30:37.040]  that people are surprised and i'm with you on that because this is what facebook does so for
[30:37.040 --> 30:42.800]  example compare and contrast to if the same thing had been announced about twitter now twitter is a
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.840]  screwy company and i don't quite get their strategy i think that the people who run twitter
[30:47.840 --> 30:52.240]  are not very good at twitter or they're not very good at seeing what twitter is good for
[30:52.240 --> 30:56.720]  but if this had come out about twitter i would have been very i would have been surprised because
[30:56.720 --> 31:01.520]  this doesn't sound like something twitter would do and i would have been surprised and i think
[31:01.520 --> 31:05.760]  i would have been appalled i would you know i would but it would seem out of character for
[31:05.760 --> 31:13.280]  twitter incorporated to do something like this um where at that that to me is my point my point
[31:13.280 --> 31:17.520]  isn't to be so cynical as to assume that all companies are doing stuff like that and that
[31:17.520 --> 31:21.760]  nobody should be outraged about facebook here because this is what they do what i'm saying is
[31:21.760 --> 31:25.920]  what i'm saying is open your eyes this is what facebook does time and time again and i think
[31:25.920 --> 31:32.720]  that's an important distinction i i think that twitter it would not surprise me if we found out
[31:32.720 --> 31:38.640]  they were doing things with your not with your stream but uh evaluating your stream for advertising
[31:38.640 --> 31:43.600]  they might even do that now i don't know but anything anything about like in a googly sort
[31:43.600 --> 31:48.800]  of way looking at your stuff and then using that to decide what other stuff they show you i'd buy
[31:48.800 --> 31:52.960]  that and i don't even know that i'd be offended by that but trying to manipulate me emotionally
[31:53.840 --> 31:58.640]  i don't know though maybe and that people you know i don't want to be too callous about it
[31:58.640 --> 32:04.480]  and i think it clearly shows it makes facebook as a corporation come across as incredibly callous
[32:05.360 --> 32:12.400]  it's really i mean it no doubt about it but some people and it sounds like you're one of them
[32:12.400 --> 32:18.720]  really feel like anything related to attempting to manipulate people's emotions is just crossing
[32:18.720 --> 32:24.480]  a sort of ethical line that that just should not be crossed whereas i would say isn't every
[32:24.480 --> 32:30.800]  advertisement in an attempt to manipulate people emotionally i yeah i agree with that and uh i
[32:30.800 --> 32:35.440]  would say that it's not the it's not that they're trying to manipulate me emotionally it's that
[32:35.440 --> 32:41.280]  they're willing to manipulate me emotionally in a negative way if they're if they're altering my
[32:41.280 --> 32:44.960]  timeline to try to make me happier and it works great if they're altering my timeline to try to
[32:44.960 --> 32:51.760]  make me sad that's not okay yeah but you can't do the science without having like a control group
[32:51.760 --> 32:57.840]  right yeah i'm not trying to defend it i'm just saying i can kind of see their perspective if
[32:57.840 --> 33:04.320]  you're gonna be sick bastards see to me the part that's offensive is is is not that they tried to
[33:04.320 --> 33:09.280]  make some sad and some happy it's i i because i don't think that they tried to make people
[33:09.920 --> 33:14.400]  suicidal i haven't read enough details to see i would like to i'd be curious to see
[33:14.400 --> 33:20.080]  like if you were in one of the two groups what the difference would be like here's what your
[33:20.080 --> 33:26.320]  example users feed would have looked like if they weren't chosen for it at all well they probably
[33:26.320 --> 33:30.640]  probably do things like if you're uh if you're single they're gonna show you lots of posts of
[33:30.640 --> 33:36.800]  people getting married and and uh having babies and stuff trying to make you feel bad that'd be
[33:36.800 --> 33:40.960]  my guess right like if you're not in a relationship emphasize other people's relationships or
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.920]  something exactly right and exactly but i'm curious i haven't seen a lot of details about
[33:45.920 --> 33:51.280]  exactly how they did the manipulation well they the the guy who did it just wrote a response i
[33:51.280 --> 33:54.960]  haven't read it yet but apparently i mean he's going on record he's saying here's here's why
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.800]  we did what we did it just it there's a certain tone deafness to to them that they that they seem
[34:00.800 --> 34:08.800]  to be surprised that that people are reacting this way because it's not like this was a secret
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.680]  internal project that that a whistleblower leaked it's it's a paper they published in a real
[34:15.680 --> 34:20.560]  scientific journal you know they published it they were they're proud of the science behind it
[34:21.280 --> 34:24.800]  you know never crossed their minds that people would be grossed out by this right that this
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.560]  might be something they wouldn't want to tell people that they're doing like there's obviously
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.960]  a very strange culture there at facebook that it never even occurred to them that people might be
[34:32.960 --> 34:40.080]  offended by this you know yeah i mean ab testing with people's mental health that's uh that's the
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.960]  kind of thing that i don't know maybe if if they allowed you to opt in like here's a new program
[34:44.960 --> 34:48.720]  we're doing well you did everybody that's what they're saying is that every every single user
[34:48.720 --> 34:56.160]  of facebook has opted in and that if you read their privacy uh statement that there's you know
[34:56.160 --> 35:00.240]  clearly you know there's and some people have even called it out there's even you know it even
[35:00.240 --> 35:06.000]  specifically says that you know that something about research and you know who reads that nobody
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.200]  because it's opaque and it is and super long and they probably show it to you in like six point
[35:11.200 --> 35:17.440]  type but it is there and that part of their argument is that everybody has uh hasn't cooked
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.600]  you know can you imagine apple doing something like that and saying well if you would have read
[35:21.600 --> 35:29.600]  that itunes update agreement it was all there i think the the most upsetting part to me it's
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.720]  like as a designer i think to myself the the way that and part of why i think that twitter
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.680]  would never do something like this is twitter you're seeing the stream and the value is in
[35:39.680 --> 35:44.000]  having all of that data and the value to you like there's an expectation that all of the tweets are
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.080]  going to be there and facebook's approach you're not a you're not a facebook user so i guess you
[35:48.080 --> 35:52.960]  don't get to see this you're you don't have to yeah but i'm really anxious to sign up now
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.640]  but they do a thing where they don't show you a timeline they show you it's kind of a timeline
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.360]  but they order it however they want right and so when you when you open the facebook app on your
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.960]  phone it pushes you to the top it scrolls you to the top uh or it leaves you in the same spot and
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.080]  you with like a sort of like a jaggy tap here to load more kind of a thing but as you go to the
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.560]  top like there's no rhyme or reason to why the things are ordered the way they are they do the
[36:18.560 --> 36:22.000]  thing at the top isn't the newest thing and it doesn't even seem to be the most important or
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.720]  most interesting thing uh and my guess is that the manipulation is that right and maybe that they
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.040]  make things that they their algorithm says hey this seems like something that's going to make
[36:33.040 --> 36:41.520]  dave feel good um you know i don't know somebody like a friend who's on vacation and has taken what
[36:41.520 --> 36:45.920]  algorithmically looks like a happy photograph this is going to make dave feel good let's put
[36:45.920 --> 36:52.480]  the photograph right here at the top you know yeah and it bothers me that they would make
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.600]  editorial decisions about what i do and do not see when i have intentionally befriended or followed
[36:57.600 --> 37:01.920]  all of these people right it suggests that my behavior would suggest that i want to see all
[37:01.920 --> 37:08.720]  of those things let me curate it yeah and it does seem i i and i i do think i think maybe that's the
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.520]  core of what's really rubbing people the wrong way here and maybe is gonna give this scandal
[37:13.520 --> 37:19.200]  some legs maybe is is the fact that they tried to make people feel bad and you mentioned that
[37:19.200 --> 37:24.480]  specifically right it would be different too if what they did was if they tried three different
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.480]  algorithms to make people feel better about themselves and group a it worked group b it
[37:30.480 --> 37:38.000]  didn't group c it actually had the detrimental effect and made this group feel bad they didn't
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.720]  try to do it but it's like whoa it ends up that if you only show them pictures of such and such
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.360]  that it actually makes them feel bad and can you imagine the headlines they'd all say facebook can
[37:49.360 --> 37:55.440]  make you happier right as opposed to the fact that they set out to make to make people some
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.680]  some group of people feel a little worse facebook intentionally wanted some part of its uh user base
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.280]  to be less happy the fact that that that's part of what would make what for years has kept me from
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.320]  using facebook like even wanting to sign up is that i just don't get it i don't get what's in
[38:12.320 --> 38:19.280]  the feed whereas i i especially old twitter like but and like the twitter that you still can
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.720]  mostly get through like tweetbot and third body clients is i know exactly what's going to be in
[38:25.760 --> 38:32.000]  my feed it's the tweets from the people i've chosen to follow ordered in the order that
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.560]  they've sent them chronological list of tweets from people who i've decided to to follow and
[38:38.560 --> 38:46.320]  i know it's in my mentioned stream people who've typed at gruber uh in the order that they've sent
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.800]  those tweets top to bottom and i know exactly what that is and i know what they're going to
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.120]  look like and it's it's there's like an integrity to it whereas to me the this the facebook what
[38:57.120 --> 39:03.440]  do you call it the the feed feed there's no integrity to it if if it's arbitrarily the
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.760]  you know ordered and i don't get it that to me it seems like it why would i sign up for that
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.200]  there's like an inner an inner there's an inner syracuse in me that wants
[39:18.560 --> 39:22.880]  i just want to know the rules right i want to know the rules for what this is going to be
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.440]  yeah exactly and that's my biggest complaint as a facebook user right well i mean i guess
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.480]  i have other complaints my biggest is that i just don't know what i'm looking at right like
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.120]  my email inbox i know exactly what it is somebody knows my email address they've typed an email
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.240]  to that address and they've sent it and then it comes in and my mail client will display those
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.280]  messages in chronological data order the other thing facebook does like that is they they show
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.880]  you this list of people you may know and i gotta tell you like one out of 200 i actually know i
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.480]  don't know who any of these people are twitter does that for me and it's actually pretty
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.080]  remarkable because i like and i see it a lot like when i'm checking the daring fireball account
[40:00.080 --> 40:04.160]  because the daring fireball account doesn't follow anybody and they'll say hey maybe you
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.360]  want to start following people how about these people and it'll be like uh amy gruber brent
[40:09.360 --> 40:15.360]  simmons and you know i don't know john moltz yeah exactly it's like wow that's actually pretty good
[40:16.800 --> 40:20.240]  you should get those people yeah you should hire those people away from twitter all right let me
[40:20.240 --> 40:25.680]  take a spot here and thank our second sponsor and then we'll we'll move on we'll get to the real part
[40:25.680 --> 40:34.320]  of the show i want to thank our good friends at transporter that's the company name is connected
[40:34.320 --> 40:41.840]  data they've sponsored the show before basic idea you buy a little piece of hardware from them
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.200]  it's called a transporter you set it up on your home network install a little bit of software on
[40:47.200 --> 40:53.840]  your mac and all of a sudden you've got effectively your own little private drop box get a little
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.360]  folder on your mac you put files on the folder they get synced to the transporter the little
[40:59.360 --> 41:05.520]  device with storage on it in your house now here's where it gets more interesting it's only stored
[41:05.520 --> 41:14.160]  on the transporter there is no cloud storage the cloud is only used for negotiating from your
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.760]  network to outside the network in other words bridging through your your home router and stuff
[41:19.760 --> 41:25.440]  like that the actual data storage is only written to disk on your device you can buy more than one
[41:25.440 --> 41:31.440]  device you can have one at your home one at your office or one in two different locations and
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.600]  they'll hook them up to the same account and they'll do exactly what you think they'll do
[41:35.600 --> 41:40.640]  they'll just sync together and they'll both be complete copies of each other so you can find
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.080]  other transporter users and you can do things like set up shared folders and say here's a folder on
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.800]  my transporter i'm going to share it with dave whiskus and now we both have access to that
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.320]  folder and we both know here's where the data is stored it's stored on my transporter and your
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.360]  transporter because they're shared folders between us and that's it big big difference between
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.120]  sharing stuff in the cloud and for some people a lot of you i know this i've heard it from people
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.920]  who listen to the show for legal reasons a lot of people people work in the medical industry
[42:09.920 --> 42:14.480]  and i'm sure other places where there's ndas and stuff like that you legally are not allowed to
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.160]  share certain data on devices where you don't have complete control over the device you can't
[42:20.160 --> 42:25.680]  put things on something like icloud or dropbox because it's you know there's legal implications
[42:25.680 --> 42:33.680]  as to where you can store the data uh really works great really really different from the
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.560]  the cloud storage application so if you need that or you want it just for the privacy implications
[42:38.560 --> 42:43.760]  of it even just for your own personal privacy that there's nothing else like it on the market
[42:43.760 --> 42:51.520]  they have two main ways to go about it the regular transporter models come with you have your choice
[42:51.520 --> 43:00.160]  500 gigabytes one terabyte two terabyte capacities you can go there use this code tts10 tts the talk
[43:00.160 --> 43:05.840]  show 10 and you'll save 10 off your purchase of any one of those devices up to 35 bucks
[43:05.840 --> 43:13.520]  go to file transporter store.com file transporter store.com and you can buy one the other thing you
[43:13.520 --> 43:19.120]  can do though is you can provide your own usb drive any usb drive and you can buy it's more
[43:19.120 --> 43:25.760]  of like a little puck the adorable little thing called the transporter sink and it's the same
[43:25.760 --> 43:32.400]  functionality exact same functionality but you just you pick your own usb hard drive you maybe
[43:32.400 --> 43:37.680]  even have a usb hard drive sitting around your office that you could already use you can save
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.800]  20 bucks on one of those because they cost a lot less it's forget about percentages just save 20
[43:42.800 --> 43:51.600]  bucks use this code tts 20 all orders using those two coats tts 10 tts 20 get free shipping
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.720]  uh and the last thing here's the last thing are you wondering if transporter is right for you
[43:56.720 --> 44:02.400]  if transporter is right for you here's the thing buy one start using it and for 30 days you have a
[44:02.400 --> 44:10.160]  completely risk-free satisfaction guarantee so use those codes tts 10 tts 20 go to file
[44:10.160 --> 44:16.480]  transporter store.com check it out buy the one you want and you have 30 days if you don't like it
[44:16.480 --> 44:23.440]  just send it right back to them my thanks to file transporter i kind of want to buy one and just
[44:23.440 --> 44:29.280]  stick it in a corner at an apple store and not tell anybody let them host my data for me wonder
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.760]  how long i wonder how long that would last i bet not long i'll bet that there's a sort of uh
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.560]  i'll bet it wouldn't last bit past the end of the day yeah they've got a i'm sure they do a sweep
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.520]  yeah because they have to clean up all the machines on a non-stop basis i mean i i think
[44:43.520 --> 44:49.440]  that there's like a checklist procedure they go through to make each one like store closes at seven
[44:49.440 --> 44:54.160]  by by eight o'clock it's back in mint condition do you think that when they close down an apple
[44:54.160 --> 44:57.600]  store before they open up the apple store not mean like permanently but like in the morning
[44:57.600 --> 45:03.200]  in the evening do you think they wipe down the the devices yeah i mean i mean physically i do
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.440]  i found i'm almost certain of it they could clean off the fingerprints for the day and whatever
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.360]  gunk i think they do it throughout the day uh that would be better i've never seen them do it
[45:11.360 --> 45:16.080]  yeah well i think that's part of the magic you know it's like they've got like a disney world
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.640]  they've got like uh things where like the the instead of like hauling the trash around the
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.560]  park they just like suck them through holes in the floor that go into the underground tunnels
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.040]  so that you don't have to see the trash being hauled out that's a nice touch yeah hey so the
[45:29.040 --> 45:35.760]  main reason i actually wanted you on the show is the one big thing from wwdc that's left on my
[45:35.760 --> 45:42.080]  things i want to talk or write about that i haven't talked or written about is yosemite yeah and the
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.760]  new design of yosemite and you know i thought to have you on the show because you and i are in fact
[45:47.760 --> 45:56.160]  collaborating working on a uh uh mac app this summer so we're sort of right in the middle of it
[45:56.960 --> 46:03.680]  now what are we're almost a month a month out right or four weeks since uh from wdc yeah
[46:03.680 --> 46:12.640]  uh yeah yeah all right because it was the second so it's four weeks yeah i better get moving are
[46:12.640 --> 46:19.440]  you what what i are you using yosemite daily no i tried and there's i don't know some kind of bug
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.520]  with the upgrades i've got i have a second partition set up that's running a clean install
[46:23.520 --> 46:29.920]  of yosemite and that was running great uh and i decided okay maybe all my stuff works everything
[46:29.920 --> 46:35.760]  should be fine i'm gonna install it on my main partition and i did and it was a nightmare and
[46:35.760 --> 46:39.840]  things were things were broken and i don't mean nightmare like there were some bugs and things
[46:39.840 --> 46:45.280]  crashed i mean like finder wouldn't launch yeah if i wanted to open a file i had to do it through
[46:45.280 --> 46:51.840]  terminal and that took 45 seconds to load so i kind of i bounce back and forth if i need to
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.480]  look at ui stuff or if i need to try to evaluate the way they're doing a thing i'll switch
[46:56.480 --> 47:00.560]  partitions i'll i'll reboot into yosemite but for the moment like day to day i'm still running
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.080]  mavericks yeah it's it i got real excited about it because for a couple of days it seemed so stable
[47:06.080 --> 47:13.200]  that i thought hey i think i can switch full time quickly maybe like with the next beta and then um
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.760]  i ran into a thing where i could not log into my main account that i just created i could use a
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.480]  guest account and then from the guest account on terminal i could like use pseudo with my
[47:24.480 --> 47:27.680]  admin account but there was nothing i could do to log into the admin account
[47:28.640 --> 47:33.600]  and and then it like fixed itself somehow but it was scary enough that i was like you know what
[47:33.600 --> 47:39.680]  i better wait but you could always uh like do a backup and then run the upgrade for a week and
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.000]  if you don't like it switch back yeah i think i'll probably switch on the next beta though
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.840]  and at least uh i'll still have a a machine here running my old install of mavericks and with
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.200]  and with everything on it but everything i have so much sinks it's so much easier to to use multiple
[47:57.200 --> 48:03.920]  max now with icloud and and other syncing services that it's it's not like the old days where it was
[48:03.920 --> 48:07.920]  really really you it would just drive you nuts because there's oh i need that file and it's on
[48:07.920 --> 48:13.200]  the other machine i don't know i still can't do it i can't get my head around it and that might
[48:13.200 --> 48:18.160]  just be that i'm too used to doing things the old way of running multiple machines yeah i can't i
[48:18.160 --> 48:24.320]  can't run i have to have one mac if i have two then i like yeah icloud and dropbox make it better
[48:24.320 --> 48:29.600]  but then there's like still preferences per machine that i'll forget about the other thing
[48:29.600 --> 48:35.840]  is that i don't think it's as imperative to be using it on a daily basis design wise because
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.280]  i don't think it's that radical a design and as the you know it's a month as the month has gone
[48:41.280 --> 48:46.960]  on i'm i'm happy with it almost completely uh the parts i'm not happy with i don't think are that
[48:46.960 --> 48:53.040]  big a deal what aren't you happy with well we could i've told you about the okay buttons i
[48:53.040 --> 48:59.280]  don't like that uh we can come back to that in a second um but i don't feel like it's fundamentally
[48:59.280 --> 49:05.520]  changed the way you design a good mac app it's a new you know it it almost is only skin deep
[49:05.520 --> 49:14.560]  and i don't mean that as a complaint i think it speaks to um you know that they did they if it's
[49:14.560 --> 49:21.920]  not broke don't don't fix it in terms of you know what it means to be a mac app as opposed to ios 7
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.120]  which i think was more a significantly more radical change in that you really needed to be
[49:27.120 --> 49:35.520]  using the ios 7 betas on a daily basis to get a feel for how an app should should be designed for
[49:35.520 --> 49:43.920]  ios 7 last summer yeah there's all the rumors leading up to wwc that look the 10 10 is going
[49:43.920 --> 49:47.920]  to be a pretty dramatic makeover it's going to be it's very ios 7 that's what we kept it has to be
[49:47.920 --> 49:53.680]  very ios 7 and when we saw it i was taken aback at how not ios 7 it was yeah i i agree with that
[49:53.680 --> 50:00.800]  they look related but they look like siblings you know the way that was sometimes you meet you know
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.520]  a brother and a sister and you're like oh yeah you two kind of look alike but not like in a freaky
[50:05.520 --> 50:12.320]  way you know well and also playing to their own strengths yeah it feels like a very measured
[50:12.320 --> 50:16.800]  uh you know and maybe it would have been a bigger surprise if there were no ios 7 i think that ios
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.240]  7 softened the blow maybe but i remember you and i talking about this when we were sort of trying
[50:22.240 --> 50:27.120]  to guess what yosemite might look like and the one thing we kept looking at and and in some ways it
[50:27.120 --> 50:33.200]  was like oh that would be kind of cool but then there were in other ways we were both like gritting
[50:33.200 --> 50:40.080]  our teeth like oh this could be bad is the iCloud web apps yeah right so when you go to iCloud.com
[50:40.080 --> 50:45.920]  on a mac or windows i guess but you get like you know you're using a mouse pointer you're using a
[50:45.920 --> 50:53.280]  trackpad or a mouse in a physical keyboard you're not touching the screen um but it looks really ios
[50:53.280 --> 50:59.840]  70 yeah but in in a good way in a measured way where it it does it's not i don't know
[51:00.480 --> 51:06.560]  looking at the web apps the iCloud.com stuff it felt like a sort of i don't want to say happy
[51:06.560 --> 51:10.320]  medium but you could you could start to get a sense of how they would solve some of these
[51:10.320 --> 51:15.040]  like windowing problems because on ios you don't you'll never have two apps open at the same time
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.520]  you don't have to worry about one thing sitting in front of another thing whereas on a mac
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.120]  you'll always have that problem and it seemed like they were starting to hint at well we
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.120]  we're still going to have shadows we're still going to treat these things as individual
[51:28.640 --> 51:33.920]  structures on the screen yeah but i think that that's why i'm looking at it now i'm looking at
[51:33.920 --> 51:41.360]  iCloud mail uh and it looks way more like an ipad app than a mac app and oh oh yeah what's like the
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.440]  further you get in yeah like the ui i guess what i'm looking at is some of the things like
[51:46.080 --> 51:53.280]  uh if you go into contacts and you click to delete somebody it it feels it's it's ios 70 but it you
[51:53.280 --> 51:57.440]  you can start to see the hinting like the way the window the like alert thing comes up the delete
[51:57.440 --> 52:03.360]  confirmation the way it comes up and the way it sits on the screen that to me hints at what we
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.360]  wound up getting in Yosemite more than it feels like a direct translation of of anything from ios
[52:09.360 --> 52:17.600]  yeah um well and the other thing the big difference too is that ios not ios uh the iCloud
[52:17.600 --> 52:24.080]  interface doesn't have a lot of like a lot of the buttons don't really have strong tap down states
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.560]  you know pressed states you know i don't know what the best way to call i always call it tap down but
[52:28.560 --> 52:35.120]  pressed state you know sort of like ios whereas uh Yosemite does you feel pretty good because that's
[52:35.120 --> 52:40.160]  that's been a thing for you buttons that look like buttons has been my obsession and to me Yosemite
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.400]  doesn't change it at all like buttons all look like buttons in a way that i i really hope that
[52:44.400 --> 52:49.280]  ios i guess we have to wait for nine now but i hope that ios nine takes some cues from that
[52:49.280 --> 52:57.920]  yeah uh and there's it's such a weird place to to go from here but the uh the google stuff kind of
[52:59.520 --> 53:06.560]  it's showing if you they're uh the material ui well hold that well finish your point but let's
[53:06.560 --> 53:12.080]  come back to that right right uh it's to me is kind of a hint of in an alternate universe
[53:12.800 --> 53:18.640]  what ios 9 might a direction that it could go in where it's a little bit more shadowy
[53:18.640 --> 53:23.280]  it's a little bit like a return not to skeuomorphism but uh some kind of happy
[53:23.280 --> 53:30.480]  point between super flat and allowing the uh the the z axis to mean something yeah i could see that
[53:31.280 --> 53:37.760]  um so we can come back to that the the night like i from to come back to something from five minutes
[53:37.760 --> 53:41.600]  ago the one thing one of the things i don't like about Yosemite is i don't like how the if you have
[53:41.600 --> 53:50.160]  a dialogue box with cancel and ok buttons the ok button is already blue with white text but that's
[53:50.160 --> 53:55.840]  the tap down state for the cancel button so if you press the cancel button but don't let go then the
[53:55.840 --> 54:05.680]  two buttons look almost identical like right to me they picked a bad a bad look for the default
[54:05.680 --> 54:10.640]  button it to me the default button should look different from the other buttons but it shouldn't
[54:10.640 --> 54:16.320]  look as different as as the one in Yosemite and it seems like what you would want is something that
[54:16.320 --> 54:23.040]  both indicates that this is selected but also uh like because some people are going to hit the the
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.680]  return key on their keyboard rather than clicking the button because then the other thing conversely
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.640]  is so that the if the cancel button or if there's more than one if you know any of the other regular
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.520]  buttons the ones that don't activate just by hitting return when you tap press and hold on
[54:37.520 --> 54:43.680]  the button you get this really vibrant press state it goes from a white background with black text
[54:43.680 --> 54:49.280]  to a blue background with white text super vibrant difference from whether it's pressed or unpressed
[54:49.280 --> 54:56.240]  whereas the default button goes from vibrant blue with white text to a slightly different
[54:56.240 --> 55:01.600]  shade of vibrant blue with white text it's it's an almost indistinguishable difference between pressed
[55:01.600 --> 55:08.640]  and unpressed it just seems like an unforced error on apple's part to to do that and it's a
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.360]  super niggling thing for me to dwell on but it's one of the things where i i can't get even a month
[55:13.360 --> 55:19.040]  in i can't get over it you've you've been i don't know grousing about the buttons the tap down state
[55:19.040 --> 55:24.720]  and buttons since ios 7 came out are you i think even during the betas that's been like a a thing
[55:24.720 --> 55:29.520]  for you and maybe it maybe it really is just that johnny i've isn't really thinking too much about
[55:29.520 --> 55:34.240]  the way buttons look when they're pressed yeah it seems like it seems like they've i don't know like
[55:34.240 --> 55:42.240]  i have a much bigger um i put more importance on it than than johnny ives apple does and even i
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.560]  think even more than i do like it's it's a good thing to care about but it's like i look at it
[55:46.560 --> 55:50.080]  like oh you know it doesn't really bother me that much it's not the first thing i'd go to the reason
[55:50.080 --> 55:58.000]  i care about it is that to me it's the only real feedback you get like in the real world when you
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.800]  click a button there's no doubt in your mind when you've pressed it down and when you've let it go
[56:05.360 --> 56:09.120]  because you feel it right if at least as if it's a nice button with a bit of clickiness
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.920]  like the buttons on all the buttons on the iphone right here i am i've got the iphone in my hand and
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.400]  i'm pressing the volume buttons and they click and i know when i've pressed it down because
[56:18.400 --> 56:21.920]  there's a click and i know when i've let go because it clicks the other way whereas when
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.480]  you're pressing things on screen especially on the iphone to me it's even more important on the
[56:26.480 --> 56:35.040]  iphone it's like you don't feel any click there is no haptic feedback um and you know who knows
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.600]  maybe that's where they're going with new devices later this calendar year is haptic feedback but
[56:39.600 --> 56:44.560]  then why did they change it a year ago in iowa 7 you know i know i i remember last year during
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.880]  the summer a lot of people speculated that the the decrease in visual feedback on press states
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.280]  for buttons might you know a lot of people were guessing there'd be haptic feedback in the iphone
[56:55.280 --> 57:02.160]  5s and there's not so to me that visual feedback is all you get and so to me it's worth emphasizing
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.320]  when we were at build we were playing with some of those uh they had that press room where you
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.320]  could play with the the phones and stuff and they a lot of the i think most of them if not all of
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.240]  them had haptic feedback so you'd tap something and it would give you like a little bit of a buzz
[57:14.240 --> 57:19.200]  and in playing with it i realized it's just it's not the magic that i thought it was where the
[57:19.200 --> 57:23.920]  thing right under my finger is buzzing it's just the device vibrates the reason you couldn't do
[57:23.920 --> 57:28.320]  that today on the iphone right but that's yeah i think if apple were going to do it they'd want
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.720]  to do some kind of advanced thing where it it literally somehow gives you feedback right where
[57:32.720 --> 57:38.480]  you've pressed not that the whole device is vibrating which is what the windows phone devices
[57:38.480 --> 57:43.040]  do like i think they were all weren't they all set so that when you're typed h key press gave you
[57:44.160 --> 57:50.240]  a tap yeah and it's not like it's not like your phone buzzing in your pocket buzz it's not that
[57:50.240 --> 57:53.360]  kind of vibrator just like a little yeah just a little something like you don't you almost even
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.720]  notice it i didn't hate it but i didn't find it helpful either i i liked it until i realized that
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.720]  there's no magic there and it was just my it was just the phone buzzing in my hand well it doesn't
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.360]  solve to me the problem like so for example on the iphone keyboard right from the get-go from
[58:07.360 --> 58:17.120]  2007 when you press a key you get um like you you press the s key an s pop-up shows up above your
[58:17.120 --> 58:22.720]  thumb yeah and it's like if so if you're watching as you type there's this visual indication that
[58:22.720 --> 58:30.560]  you just typed an s um because you you there's no other you know you need that feedback because
[58:30.560 --> 58:34.160]  there's the buttons are the buttons for each key on the keyboard are so close to each other that
[58:34.160 --> 58:39.440]  you wouldn't know whereas if the whole phone vibrates or taps in the exact same way no matter
[58:39.440 --> 58:45.920]  which key you pressed it doesn't help you know that you typed an s instead of a d it's you just
[58:45.920 --> 58:51.120]  know you typed something and to me that's that's not helpful have you ever done one of those tests
[58:51.120 --> 58:57.840]  where you see if you type better with the the clicks or without the clicks no i you know i've
[58:57.840 --> 59:02.240]  always got the ringer off on my phone because i just i i almost never want to hear my phone ring
[59:03.520 --> 59:09.760]  but it seems it seems like when the clicks are on my typing accuracy goes up i think so too i keep
[59:09.760 --> 59:14.960]  the clicks on there's the uh well i mean i keep the clicks on my my ringer is always right so you
[59:14.960 --> 59:19.680]  don't actually hear them right the building i live in there's i gotta enter a key code to get in
[59:19.680 --> 59:24.160]  and uh about a month or two ago they they changed i don't know what they did but it no longer when
[59:24.160 --> 59:29.600]  you dial the keypad they don't beep at you anymore and without the beeps i'll screw it up two or
[59:29.600 --> 59:33.680]  three times before i get in hmm yeah i like the key tips key types but there's some people who
[59:33.680 --> 59:38.480]  think that that's so absurd that they can't believe they they find it shocking that i
[59:39.040 --> 59:44.160]  use the the key clicks on the ios it's similar though the key clicks aren't that much of a help
[59:44.160 --> 59:48.080]  because they it's similar to the whole phone vibrating at each time you get the same click
[59:48.080 --> 59:51.760]  no matter which key you've pressed it doesn't help you know that you've got the right key
[59:51.760 --> 59:57.040]  as opposed to like on a hardware keyboard like on a blackberry with a hardware keyboard you know
[59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.320]  that you've pressed the right key because there's an actual physical sensation but the physical
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.360]  sensation is identical for each key yeah but you in practice though if you think about it if you've
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.160]  ever i've never used a blackberry full time but even if i've just toyed with one you know you've
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.240]  gotten the right key though spatially you know like if your thumb is on that border between s
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.720]  and d you know that you want that depreciation to be on the left side not the right side and if you
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.200]  do hit a d by accident you can feel oh my thumb was too far to the right you know right because
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.640]  the way the key presses in right only ever presses in it doesn't slide around so depending like your
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.520]  angle of attack will change the physicality of it it clarifies you know and that that would be the
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.840]  sort of i don't know what the technology would be but if there was a way to make it so that you've
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:50.960]  got a physical click or press or some kind of sensation right on the pixels that you've pressed
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.880]  it could i could see how that would help something like keyboard typing tremendously
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.040]  but i don't even know if i mean i've never heard of such technology they should just put a hardware
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.680]  keyboard on those things yeah i do think going back to yosemite though overall though i like
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.080]  it a lot and every time i i stop using i have it on a separate machine right now i don't have
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.640]  it on a main machine but every time i go back to mavericks it's it just feels like going back to
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:22.800]  ios 6 but even more so yeah it was uh it was like a little bit of culture shock for me after spending
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.680]  a couple days in yosemite coming back to mavericks and i'm used to it now and this is it's fine i
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.760]  don't hate it it doesn't feel as dramatic as ios 6 to ios 7 uh going the other direction but it it
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.560]  does i am surprised at how much i like it yeah it's not as yeah it's it's funny it's not as big
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.480]  a difference clearly not as big a difference as ios 6 to ios 7 but somehow going back it was harder
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.720]  quicker because it's so familiar it's just an improvement i think in almost every way
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.000]  that it makes going back worse whereas ios 7 there were things that just took time to get used to
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.080]  whereas yosemite to me doesn't take any time to get used to it's like oh this is just better
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.160]  yeah there's not a lot of downside because in ios 7 there's a well i don't know how i feel about
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.160]  the status bar thing i don't think i like it and these buttons are weird and there's you know a
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.440]  bunch of stuff with uh mavericks to yosemite it really does just feel like they dialed it up a
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.280]  little bit i'm curious and i saw did you see that tobias frere jones somebody asked him what he
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.400]  thought about um alvetica as a system font oh no i didn't see that now you have to look at it
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.720]  afterwards but the gist of it is that um i'll put it in the show show notes um i promise um
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:42.000]  but some i forget who somebody asked tobias frere jones um formerly of of heffler frere jones and
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.200]  you know the whole yeah ugly divorce going on there um but the designer of gotham among other
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.360]  you know very very popular and well-designed font he you know spoke very highly of lucida grand as
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:01.200]  a system font and and you know mentioned that some of the problems with helvetica as a system font
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.080]  but i think the bottom line and he mentions it too is that it's you know it's retina versus non-retina
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.600]  and i've only been using yosemite on a retina macbook pro i haven't looked at it yet i guess
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.720]  i should try it maybe put it on my macbook air or something uh and see what it looks like on
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.160]  a non-retina display and i can only imagine it is going to look worse i do think that's
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:33.040]  one of the things about yosemite that is very much in spirit with ios 7 is that it's a retina first
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.680]  display design it's designed to look optimum it's optimized for retina displays and it's
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.960]  secondarily meant to look okay on non-retina displays do you think that's a hint at apple
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.920]  wanting to move to or being ready to move to a future where there's only retina screens
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.440]  oh definitely i mean if anybody thinks it's not going to be all retina with at some point in the
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.000]  next few years i mean you're nuts but i mean how quickly that's going to be hopefully it's a sign
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.400]  that it's going to be sooner than rather than later right yeah that's what i mean like if
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.240]  they're doing if they're already setting things up for it's going to look i mean anything
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.280]  everything looks better on retina by definition but some some things translate the other direction
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.760]  better than others and i can i i don't have i don't think i have anything with a non-retina
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.720]  screen on it come to think of it because you don't have a desktop display anymore you just
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.000]  work off a 15-inch macbook pro yeah 15-inch retina uh so i don't know i haven't i haven't seen
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.360]  well you know i'm looking i'm thinking back uh helvetica was a system font on the iphone from
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:40.080]  date one and that wasn't terrible i mean it wasn't uh maybe not as readable as lucida grand but uh
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.560]  yeah it always worked on the ios and it wasn't bad but i do think it's going to be worse and
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:53.520]  i feel like the same way that it did work and it was fine on ios pre-retina it's it's definitely
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.800]  going to be i i i think there'll be complaints about it though when yosemite actually ships
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.240]  i wonder if apple's new philosophy about non-retina people is the same as mine was like yeah who cares
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.520]  i don't think so not yet i think maybe on ios it is and i think that's you know i feel like the
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.280]  only people who they really care about vaguely it would probably be owners of the original
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:23.840]  ipad mini because that device is only uh they were still being sold a year ago yeah and i
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:29.200]  well you could still buy them now right isn't okay i think so i think that that's like the low-end
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:36.960]  ipad let me see um that's the last one that i feel like they really care about because the last
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.320]  iphone that was pre-retina was 3gs i mean that's forget about it i mean you know god bless you first
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:49.680]  god bless you first if you're still rocking your 3gs but uh yeah maybe they're not i don't know
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:57.600]  maybe let's see here compare yeah they still sell the ipad mini without retina display 16 gigabytes
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:07.680]  299 oh so but you know i've jonas uses my old one and it's not bad i mean it's you know it's it's
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:13.600]  you know i don't know that it's any worse than the the then the the helvetica was is the system font
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:20.320]  on ios 6 maybe the some of the lack of contrast makes it less showy offy but yeah you know it's
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.120]  like i wrote about when they first went retina it's that i i think some of those the visual
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:32.080]  trickery making buttons look lickable and putting a lot of you know lighting effects on the buttons
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.760]  and stuff was all to sort of make the thing look better than the display was capable of really
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:43.280]  looking whereas with retina displays you can just let it actually look good just by being type on a
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:50.720]  plane background right and i'm not saying that there uh this would be in in the spirit of well
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.920]  who cares what it looks like on a non-retina screen so much as it is i don't think apple at
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.400]  this point just going by what they've done with helvetica as a system font in yosemite i don't
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:06.080]  think that they're willing to sacrifice what they think is the path forward to make things just a
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.120]  little bit better on non-retina screens i will say this using yosemite and you know i've just
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.160]  did a fair amount i don't have it on my main machine yet but i've used as much as i can in
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:22.160]  last month uh third-party apps it it varies it actually really varies uh how much they get
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:27.600]  automatically none look perfect automatically but some look a lot better than others and you can see
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.480]  who was specifying uh here display this list in the system font yeah and then there's others who
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:41.200]  said display this list in lucida grand 12 point uh and the ones who were saying just give me the
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.720]  system font they get helvetica noia automatically and it looks pretty good and the ones who were
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.600]  using lucida it just looks old and then you know some of the icons translate a little better like
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.760]  toolbar icons translate better than others some don't um but i'm really curious and and it's to
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.600]  me it's a lot like the shift from ios where you you know app makers have got to get on you know
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.800]  got to get updates out the door and make their stuff look right on yosemite but i'm curious
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:15.200]  if it's going to take longer for third-party developers to update their mac apps just in the
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.480]  way that because they're too busy updating their iphone apps first yeah yeah well i think i mean
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:27.200]  you if you're smart and the convention is that you're supposed to stick to the the apis as much
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.680]  as you can because if apple changes something out from under you you get that change for free
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.520]  this is why you're supposed to use like a stock source list and not roll your own
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.720]  so the funny one to me my favorite example of an app that looks even better in yosemite is net news
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:49.120]  wire 3 i don't know that i looked at net news wire 3 i opened up net news and it looks on a
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.680]  on a retina screen it's got some you know weird issues on mavericks and it just you know it looks
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.680]  it looks not bad i still use it as my daily news reader but it looks dated and i open it up on on
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.800]  yosemite just because i wanted to you know read my feeds i open it up and it looks great because
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.040]  the fonts are all helvetica yeah everything's in helvetica and the source list is the uh the
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.400]  vibrancy transparency oh really yeah it's one of the most uh one of the most yosemite ready apps
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:20.880]  i had on my mac yeah you know what that is another thing that i've noticed is that it's clear i
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.880]  didn't even know there was such a thing but there must obviously in hindsight there must be like a
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:33.120]  give me a default looking sidebar and those apps look pretty good on yosemite and it's
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.680]  translucent already and then there's others where they've got like a blue background with
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:44.720]  you know the wrong font and it just looks so dated looks foreign well it reminds me of um
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:51.360]  template images so the the icons that you create for a sidebar source list on the mac and the
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:58.400]  things uh like a tab bar based app on the iphone you instead of making an icon that looks like what
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.760]  the end user sees you just make an alpha an alpha channel icon with the the green icon
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:14.080]  icon where the the gradient is is what determines the the alpha so whatever apple does to update the
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.080]  os whatever the new style is your your app running on that version of the os will look like every
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.360]  other so you're never stuck like if you were to go in and make uh like looking right now at my
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.320]  screen i see finder and mavericks has that like all of the the sort of monochrome slightly uh
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:38.080]  slightly washed out icons along the side like the uh the itunes style uh those are all just
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:45.200]  you know flat black and white alpha channel uh probably jpegs or pngs sitting somewhere and then
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.960]  the second the os gets updated they all look the new way right i think bottom line wrapping up
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:58.640]  yosemite i i really like it i think that it's it's exactly exactly what apple should have done
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.120]  i don't think anything more radical was called for uh and i think it's going to prove to be
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:11.360]  far less controversial i still think there's some people who are who consider ios 7 controversial
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.720]  right i there are people who refuse to upgrade still yeah i don't think that that's going to
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.280]  happen with yosemite just because of the appearance and and other than the appearance
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.200]  it's not really that different you know they haven't really changed any of the other rules
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.720]  uh no but i do feel like especially with we we don't see any of this really today because
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:39.680]  it's all betas but uh the extension stuff and the handoff i think this to me pushes towards that
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.200]  that ideal of ages ago a friend of mine told me that his vision for computers in the future would
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.000]  be like you carry the thing around like your phone or whatever it is and you can use it the way it is
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.120]  and when you get to work you you dock it somehow and then the the interface changes so that it's
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.800]  it's custom it's tailored to the way you're working right and all of a sudden it can drive
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.520]  a 30-inch display on your desk right right and where apple apple is doing it and i think of an
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.280]  even more clever way which is allowing you to pass what really matters which is the state and
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.800]  the data back and forth and let the the machines be their own thing yeah because at a certain
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.240]  and who knows i mean i i don't know i feel like that dockable idea it always it sounds good but
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.120]  it always runs into problems and and for example your desktop computer if you have a power source
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:32.000]  even if it's a laptop but if you can put a power source into it at your desk you you want to be
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.280]  able to have apps running and consuming significant amounts of cepu in the background
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.520]  whereas your phone you'd never want that right right so what do you do like you can say okay
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:51.520]  when i dock the thing it it runs like a real unix computer and applications in the background can
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.520]  just do what they want and then i want to go to the bathroom and take my phone with me and just
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.560]  pick it up then what happens to all those processes that were running like all of a sudden
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.800]  now they're told nope nope now you're you're going to be put to sleep in uh 10 milliseconds
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:12.000]  hurry up hurry up and finish in the uh the i mean you could do things like the dock itself
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.120]  has additional cpu and memory resources and maybe those processes can attach to the dot
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.320]  it just gets super like the kind of people who really like running linux would would enjoy that
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.040]  yeah i think that this is a better approach and it's you know we can even spin it as we talk about
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.160]  some of the google iO stuff and it's you know a similar approach but uh that google has that it's
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:39.920]  not one machine that you take everywhere but like one set of state that's available everywhere that
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:47.600]  it's your state that syncs not the actual computer right and i i was eight and yosemite to me feel
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:54.480]  like we were finally there or or we're very very close to the your your ipad and your iphone and
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.000]  your mac all work together yeah one question people have been asking me i actually don't know
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.080]  the answer because i don't have a spare ipad to run ios 8 on and i'm a little hesitant to put it
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.800]  on on my ipad uh i'm running it full time on mine it's great uh you know i gotta see it because i've
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.560]  had problems in the past years where the mlb app doesn't work on the beta and it's like the only
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.920]  app that i really can't do without over summer on the ipad so i have to see but um i'm the wrong guy
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.120]  to ask about that well people have been asking will this work between continuity like handoff
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.920]  like i've started an email can you hand it off from an iphone to an ipad or is it only i don't
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.880]  know from mac to ios i think it's only mac to ios i don't think you can go ios to ios but it seemed
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.880]  that seems like something that that it could be like a 8.1 update or something later in the year
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.400]  it makes sense you know that you might want to somebody you know hey i want to go from this small
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.880]  machine the iphone where i'm pecking this thing out with my thumbs to the big machine where i do
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.160]  my email the big your somebody else's big machine for email might be their ipad right so i could see
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.000]  it coming i don't think that it's there yet though i could go test it well don't don't bother yeah
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.920]  tweet it later i am uh i'm impressed with ios 8 i'm running ios 8 on my phone my carry phone my
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.120]  day phone yeah and uh on my my day ipad i've only got the one ipad but yeah my retina ipad mini
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.760]  both are running ios 8 full time and both there i mean there's weird stuff like um i got to reboot
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.240]  my phone every couple of days because things just get wonky yeah i'm glad you brought that up because
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.640]  i've been meaning to talk about this um so what i do is i have i still have my year-old iphone 5
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.880]  which is also on verizon so i just if i and i have ios 8 on that device and i just take my sim card
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:50.160]  out of my daily iphone 5s put it in the five and then i can just use that phone all day and i've
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.360]  i've spent a week using just that and it's pretty good that's a smart way to do it yeah but you have
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.080]  to make sure you know it i couldn't do it the year before though because last year was the year where
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:07.040]  i had switched from at&t to verizon so my year-old iphone 4s i couldn't sim card swap with the
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:14.400]  verizon yeah so it only works so long as your year ago phone is on the same carrier and uh same sim
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:20.080]  setup because well it wasn't yeah exactly right right so like for us verizon phones were were not
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.480]  well they were world phones but they you couldn't i don't remember yeah it was funny and then every
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.760]  couple years they they cut the sim card size down too yeah because it was mini and now it's micro
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.160]  right like maybe with the iphone 6 they're gonna come you know and make an even smaller sim card
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.920]  i don't know yeah now it's just a it's a you get an eyedropper you just drop it in there yeah
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.760]  one thing though this is the thing i've been meaning to talk about is this was the first year
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:48.560]  so i've tried to do this uh you know run run the beta on my year-old iphone as much as i can over
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.480]  the summer uh and even like last year when i couldn't sim card swap i would at least carry the
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.000]  iphone 4s around in the house on wi-fi as you know the only thing i couldn't do is get phone calls
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.400]  but i don't like i said i don't get many phone calls but everything else i get this is the first
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:11.440]  year where i don't find going back to the iphone 5 to be slow physically slow like the interface
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.720]  feels slow i notice it in some places but like the keyboard doesn't feel slow like it always
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:23.040]  that's the one thing every single year when i test the new beta of of the operating system on my year
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.560]  old iphone i think and how did i ever type on this thing the keyboard is too slow and it's never been
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.040]  i don't know if it's because there were you know the the operating system slowed down i don't know
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:40.320]  if it's just that i got used to the increased or decreased latency of the interface responsiveness
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.240]  but this is the one year where for the most part day to day i don't feel that much difference
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:49.680]  between the 5s and 5 just in terms of navigating around the operating system well this is with you
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:55.200]  running ios 8 on on the older phone yeah i would you typically you're saying you typically run the
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.480]  new os on the older phone yes i'm thinking that it has more to do with the the newness of the os
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.880]  than the age of the phone in terms of your keyboard latency i don't know i just i'm i'm
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.400]  thinking of maybe that maybe it's that ios 8 because they didn't do anything new interface wise
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.640]  radically that it's nothing nothing but improved performance wise as opposed to like last year
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.400]  obviously a lot of people had complaints that ios 7 was dog slow on older hardware yeah there's
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.600]  nothing no i don't think there's any reason to worry about that from ios 7 to ios 8 and i think
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:35.200]  it combines with the fact that maybe the iphone 5 was the first one where the a6 was sort of
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:41.360]  good enough you know that it's you know at least for things like typing that we don't need you know
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.640]  the speed improvements i'm sure help in image processing for example right like like when you
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.360]  take uh 10 snapshots in a row using the press and hold thing there's obviously a lot of computation
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:59.120]  that's involved there the faster a7 really helps but for just showing a touchscreen keyboard and
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:06.880]  typing the a5 i i think is where where it hit the fast enough mark because i'm doing it the other
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.160]  way around where i've got ios 8 on my 5s and i've got ios 7 running on uh well i don't keep these
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.480]  devices around so wwc you had brought amy's old 4s for me and having a two-year gap between those
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.920]  phones i'm running ios 7 on the older phone and ios 8 on the newer phone and i noticed keyboard
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:31.440]  issues on my 5s oh the 5s running 8 yeah yeah i like the keyboard feels a little sticky to me
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.440]  huh that's interesting that's why i'm thinking it might have more to do with the os and the newness
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.120]  of that than it does with the hardware i mean i could be wrong i don't know just be my setup
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.400]  interesting uh i will say this too i don't know if i mentioned this before on the show but i
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:51.200]  a lot of the little things in ios 8 are addictive like the reply to an iMessage from anywhere
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:57.360]  yeah yeah is really really nice it's tough because the uh that makes it hard to go back
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.000]  like i feel like as long like when the next beta comes out i'll probably just install it on my
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:11.920]  day phone too it's it's funny it's funny because the uh normally year-to-year the upgrade you it's
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.760]  tough to go back because there's like some big new feature or there's something that you really like
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.520]  day-to-day using ios 8 other than the uh the the typing suggestion thing i don't really notice like
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.960]  it just it looks and feels like a slightly buggier ios 7 yeah but it's got those night that the
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:32.240]  notification thing for replying is really really nice i don't think i've used it that much oh man
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:38.400]  once you start it's it's it really gets it just feels crazy to go back to not being able to do it
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:44.720]  i do like getting text messages in in multiple devices like i've noticed uh when people text
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.880]  rather than like people who don't have iphones it shows up on my ipad now and it kind of freaks me
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.280]  out oh see i don't think i've noticed that yet because i get so few text messages from
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:59.840]  that aren't blue yeah it was uh one one uh one came yesterday and i'm i'm looking at my ipad
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.080]  and i see the name in there and i was like wait what that person has an android phone how is this
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.560]  even possible oh and it can wait and it shows up on your ipad well then maybe maybe some of those
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.280]  continuity features do work iphone to ipad right because i think on the demo during the keynote
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:18.560]  they showed it showing up on your mac right they didn't show it the assumption is that yeah yeah i
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:22.880]  expected to show up on my mac uh i never would have expected it on my i mean it makes perfect sense
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.920]  yeah i guess it was a surprise i wonder if that's it's got to be that they're they're like on the
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:37.440]  same wi-fi network or maybe even bluetooth it's still confusing to me and i know that i've listened
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.920]  to a few other podcasts nobody's nobody's quite sure which of these features are running over
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:47.280]  bluetooth and which are running over wi-fi and which are maybe using both depending on their
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:54.160]  availability seems like a lot of this stuff though depends upon the bluetooth lt low low
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:00.720]  low-energy bluetooth le and they're the cutoff on max for that is pretty recent so there's gonna be
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.240]  a lot of people with semi-recent max like two-year-old max two and a half year old max
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.760]  who when they upgrade to yosemite are going to be bitching because they don't get these features
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.600]  i think i mean if it were me i would make it to where it ran over bluetooth unless bluetooth
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.720]  wasn't available and then it ran over wi-fi because a lot of people turn bluetooth off on
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:24.080]  their phone to save battery right so i think that's a good point i think that's a good point
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.240]  yeah i feel like that trick is gonna start it it's getting to the point where enough of the features
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:36.080]  depend upon it that you know i think most of i i because i usually keep bluetooth off too for the
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.040]  same reason but i feel like it's gonna get harder and harder to to do that or you're gonna keep
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.600]  running into oh why isn't this working oh duh i turned bluetooth off yeah and i think enough
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.480]  people are still doing it though it's gonna be uh apple wouldn't want to get those support calls
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:57.040]  and if you could just fall back to wi-fi why not do it i found out my son runs his uh all of his
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:05.360]  ios devices at maximum brightness all the time do you need to maybe send him to warby parker uh
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.000]  he knows that it's running um that it's running the battery down and in fact every day his iphone
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.520]  and ipad both completely run out of battery and i said hey why look you've got brightness all the
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.560]  way up and goes well i'm not he didn't say compromise but he said i'm not going to it's
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.960]  he thinks it's gross to run the display at less than full brightness he'd rather have the device
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:39.040]  be dead than have it not at uh maximum uh beauty which i kind of respect i i respect his uh i don't
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.520]  know he's got a philosophy there and you stick into it yeah i'm that way with my mac my mac is
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.880]  always at full brightness in fact that auto brightness thing i never turned it off i really
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:53.520]  should but if i'm in uh like when when i work out of the the office if i pass in front of a window
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.960]  or at a certain time of day my screen starts to dim and it just drives me nuts i want it always
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.840]  as bright as i can possibly be unless i'm on a plane yeah exactly like the airplane mode for
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.280]  mac should it involve cutting your display brightness down well you know that that brings
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.800]  up something we didn't see in yosemite and i expect to at some point because you know there's
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:20.480]  all this talk about um will we ever get like y max or some kind of lte chip or something in a mac
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.680]  and the only like technically that wouldn't be that hard to do it's just that software
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.080]  isn't really written for that you're going to run through your data pretty quickly
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.080]  yeah that's it seems like we used to who knows maybe someday this year they'll come out with that
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:41.760]  uh well they already kind of have it like your mac can can talk to your uh your access
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:46.880]  point and find out that it's an access point running over a data connection rather than
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.640]  running through like a you know a regular wired connection like that's a thing that they can that
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.200]  the like if you've got like one of those karma devices or something it can report back to your
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:04.320]  computer that it's it's like a you know a data network device well and there is the new feature
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:12.480]  in yosemite and ios 8 where once you've paired your phone with if your phone has hotspot capability
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:20.000]  you can turn it on entirely from your mac without interacting with your phone right so it seems like
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.280]  there would have to be some apis in place or something to i don't know so apps can know when
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.080]  they're in that mode versus a different mode so that like things like uh automatic downloading
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.120]  for certain apps gets turned off right i remember i always remember it was marco who uh
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:45.040]  who had wwdc a couple years ago was tethering instead of paying for hotel wi-fi and it it was
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:51.280]  like you know he got there on sunday monday was the keynote and then the new episode of madmen
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:59.280]  hit itunes and he ran through like he ran through like four gigabytes of lte and got his like 18t
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.720]  account closed for the month because it downloaded an episode of madman that's fantastic right but
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.560]  that's exactly the sort of thing you don't want to do and i don't know how you you know i do
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.280]  think that that's basically why apple hasn't done it is that that you know and i know i guess that
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.840]  there's opt-in things that apps could do to say hey what kind of network am i on before i do this
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.400]  but i feel like there's too much software that's already written that just says do i have a network
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:31.360]  connection if so download this giant multi-gigabyte thing right and i mean we live in a world now
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:37.680]  where there's a pretty good chance that your data connection is coming through the air but even if
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.440]  you're on wi-fi there's a good chance that the thing on the other end of that wi-fi is talking
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.960]  to sprint or talking to verizon or whomever yeah i think that the new feature i think that i think
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.400]  they're probably well i wouldn't say never but my guess is they're never going to they're not going
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:59.600]  to do lte equipped macbooks and that this new feature where you can turn on tethering from your
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.840]  iphone right from the menu in in uh on your mac is as close as they're going to get and that's
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.520]  pretty that's close enough i think yeah i was going to say do you think that's good do you
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.520]  think that's or would you rather have a mac that had a data connection yeah because you'd have to
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.320]  pay an extra 15 bucks a month at the minimum depending on you know like verizon i think it's
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.040]  like every time you add a device you have we have like one shared family pool of data but every time
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.600]  you add a device you still have to add 10 bucks a month so rather than add another 10 bucks a month
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.200]  just just let me use the phone because it's going to be the same connection anyway
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:40.080]  yeah but with your phone your mac has a great big battery in it yeah i yeah but if you're on your
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.960]  mac and have your phone you can i don't know yeah you just charge off that that's true i suppose it
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.440]  all works out yeah i don't know i think it's as close as they're going to get it's it's probably
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.760]  as close as they're going to get and it's probably in in the real world all i would ever need yeah
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:59.040]  there's something nice about having all of the stuff on your mac like everything that that you
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.320]  could have on your mac so it's it's only but the truth is my phone's always in my pocket anyway
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:09.040]  yeah all right let me take a break and thank our third and final sponsor good friends at back blaze
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:15.920]  you guys know back blaze uh online unlimited backup for your mac they have over 100 petabytes
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.200]  i don't even know how much that is of data backed up for all of their users across the whole system
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:28.320]  it's amazing um anyone can back up your day you can back up your data you know with hard drives
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.760]  on your desk you can uh send it there's all sorts of other online services here's the thing that
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.320]  they've done they can prove they can show you they have a record a track record that they can
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.600]  track record not just of backing up your data but getting it back to you like when you need it
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:50.320]  they've crossed the mark they have over 6 billion files that users of back blaze have restored
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.160]  from back place not just that they've stored you know backed up 6 billion 6 billion backed up files
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.120]  that they've gotten restored because they needed it because drive went bad a file went corrupt
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:07.600]  something like that uh you can access all of your data from anywhere from any of your devices they
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.720]  have an ipad app that lets you access and share any of your files you can restore one file at a
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:20.560]  time or all of your files easily with their web restore uh 25 of all the restores that back blaze
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:26.560]  users do are just one file right it's so super targeted when you need it when you need that one
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:32.000]  file that you know i have backed up uh it's not just for computer disasters it's for any time when
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.880]  you're out and away from your computer and you need a file oh i know i have it on my mac back
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.600]  at home but all i've got with me is my iphone just fire up the app you can get to any file

[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:23.200]  slash daring fireball backblaze.com slash daring fireball i can't i can't believe there's enough
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.200]  people out there who listen to the show who haven't signed up for it that they still keep
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:32.240]  sponsor the show i just opened up the page i have not and every time you you do the sponsor read for
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.280]  them i'm always thinking i really need to do this so this time i got it open it's the it's easiest
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:40.560]  best thing in the world you know marco had a thing that the other week i don't know if you
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:48.720]  listen to atp but marco had a thing where the drive in his uh mac pro went bad like real bad
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.960]  like in a dangerous way where he couldn't boot the machine and then when he booted from the
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.040]  emergency partition and ran disk utility it told him there was nothing wrong with his drive said
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.560]  there's nothing wrong with the drive but he couldn't log log into it and it long story short
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.360]  he solved it another way i think he used super duper and had like a super duper clone and did it
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.680]  but like he even said on the show one of the things and this is to me is the the the key it's
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.040]  that peace of mind thing where he in the back of his mind he knew if if diddling around with what
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.840]  he had on his desk with backups and soup you know super duper clones and and stuff like that didn't
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:27.840]  work the worst case scenario is he still had everything in backplace it's like that that
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:34.240]  that peace of mind is to me uh the key to backplace versus any other thing that you could
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:39.520]  do like time machine and super duper clones which are great too it's that peace of mind though of
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:46.320]  knowing that you've got this other thing off site in the cloud really like yeah it's i've got the
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.680]  page open as soon as we're done recording i'm gonna sign up for this because i had a when i was
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.880]  doing my whole yosemite second partition thing i had some some some very close calls with my own
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.280]  data and you know everything that's really important i've got on dropbox so i i wouldn't
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:04.080]  be totally screwed but it would take me a good day or two to like try to get my system back to
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:09.280]  the way it was and then it's never going to quite feel right yeah and to just have all my my stuff
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.400]  out there in one place backed up i just need to do it i'm i'm stupid for not having done it already
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:23.200]  you are uh so google material design this is the new design language that that google announced
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:30.640]  last week at io i don't think i think to summarize it to me i'm not a daily android user i mean i try
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.560]  to stay up to date um it's not as radical like going from the previous look to this new one is
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:45.200]  not as big a leap as ios 6 to ios 7 uh it's to me a little bit more like yosemite you know it's like
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:51.440]  their equivalent of yosemite it's it's it's just a sort of cleaning up and modernization and
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.960]  getting rid of some wonkiness um but i think it looks bad it's a first time to me that android
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:02.240]  looks like from top to bottom that there's one cohesive set of visual guidelines for how stuff
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.920]  should look i think even more than the visual update which you're right it's not it's a huge
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.240]  leap but what does feel like a big leap is the way they're documenting and talking about the design
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:17.520]  yeah the design side but it's weird like it it's like at first i was very complementary to it and
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:23.840]  i still am judging it mainly on what it is they're recommending that developers do which i think is
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:30.160]  all right and good and it's not just hey add animation to your user interface it's add animation
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:36.320]  in a way that that increases understanding of what's going on so if you open something it
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:41.760]  doesn't just appear on screen it opens from somewhere like from the button that you tapped
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:46.720]  to open it and then when you close it it goes back down into the thing yeah i was looking at
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:53.120]  the the docs before we we jumped on to do the show just i wanted to get my ducks in a row here
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:59.600]  and i noticed comparing the uh the android design stuff about animation versus what i thought was
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:06.960]  animation versus what is in the ios 7 hig looking at them side by side in ios 7 it says things that
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.640]  i'm not going to read it verbatim but it's more or less saying here's why you should use animations
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.040]  and here's the the scenarios and here's you want to be reserved and you want the animations to feel
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:21.840]  a certain way and the google site is okay so here's the code to do an animation and uh here's
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:26.000]  the direction things could go and uh maybe there's some like footnotes here and there about why you
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.280]  do it but it's still very still very google yeah but some of it to me is not very google it's very
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.080]  mattias duarte in particular like he i don't know him i never met him but he's he seems a bit
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:47.920]  uh he's always struck me his on-stage demeanor as being a bit twee okay um here's here's a phrase
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:53.040]  a lot of people have called this out it's very early on when you go to google.com slash design
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.240]  and start reading up on it it's somewhere in the first couple of pages and it says material is the
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:04.640]  metaphor um now this is i'm reading a material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.880]  space and a system of motion our material is grounded in tactile reality inspired by our study
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:18.640]  of paper and ink yet open to imagination and magic now what does that mean that's a lot of um
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:25.840]  what does it mean it means nothing right that is it and in fact it it's like don draper wrote that
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.920]  it's actually no because it don draper if don draper wrote it it would it would at least make
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.520]  you think of something real like i think they're not just flowery right i feel like don draper
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.560]  would go nuts at that i feel like it's the opposite it's it in fact i think it's actually
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.120]  misleading where the only thing you come out of that is something something a study of paper and
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:51.840]  ink but it's not the rules of their new interface are not grounded in the realities of paper and
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:36:01.200]  ink right there's no skeuomorphic ink bleed or paper texture and you know things bounce and move
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.760]  in ways that paper and ink can't bounce and move you know that they you know you can't have it
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.120]  both ways and say that you've based the metaphors on paper and ink and then increase the amount of
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:19.920]  animation and stretching that you can do right it's actually false it's actually misleading
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:26.720]  because paper doesn't move like liquid right i think you're better off reading the google
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.760]  material design docs not reading the actual english and just looking at it pretend you know
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:38.720]  just like like laura mipsum all of the descriptions and just go through and look at it visually and
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.680]  it it to me when i did that it makes way more sense than if you try to read it and understand
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:50.160]  what this shit about a rationalized space and a system of motion it's very hand wavy it's like
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.040]  somebody somebody thought way too hard about this yeah they want to make it seem like more than it
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:04.000]  is even uh during the keynote i forget the line but the he said uh the ink the the ink oh god i
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.760]  don't forget they call it the but the the ink thing moves like water and like right there it's
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:14.880]  well pick a metaphor is it ink or is it water choose one word yeah you're already confusing
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:20.880]  things for me i do think too and i think it's interesting it'd be interesting to see how quickly
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:28.880]  android developers pick up on on these guidelines because to me every time i've tried android it's
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:34.960]  it the google stuff is okay it doesn't make me happy and it doesn't feel good but it's okay but
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.440]  then as soon as you get into third-party apps it's just brutal just brutal in terms of aesthetics
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:49.040]  and layout um and part of this is the advantage that a lot of this stuff doesn't come from the
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:55.120]  operating system really it's this google play services thing that you get from the the google
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.800]  play store and it's like this shared library so that you developers don't have to wait till
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.200]  everybody's running the new android l you know version i don't know if they're going to call
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:14.000]  it 5.0 or whatever which is going to be years but a a big chunk of existing android phones that won't
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.320]  get the upgrade to the full new os will get the new google play services which is the shared
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.040]  library and i think that i think this interface stuff will all be distributed through there so
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:30.640]  it's interesting i i can't wait to see because like with with the ios all the major developers
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.440]  every app that i i can't remember how long it took till every app i use on a daily basis was updated
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:41.040]  for ios 7 but it didn't take long there's like one or two holdouts on like my first two home screens
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:46.320]  i don't know that android has developers who care about stuff like that
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.600]  well it seems like what they're trying to do looking at the google.com slash design this is
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.160]  pretty well put together they're trying really hard to make it look like they care about design
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:03.040]  and that sounds uh dismissive but what i mean is they they they're really trying to get across
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.760]  the importance of design to developers like to maybe they've they've recognized that that lack
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.400]  of consistency there's like even fragmentation within the design and so they're trying to get
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.760]  that lack of consistency there's like even fragmentation within the design of of third-party
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.840]  apps and maybe if they can bump up quality or maybe if they can set an example they can bump
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.000]  up quality across the board it's interesting to me that apple's approach to this is they create
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.480]  thoughtful designs that people want to emulate and then they go and document those designs and people
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.400]  will try to achieve that themselves whereas google will write documentation and make apis
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.960]  yeah i did i noticed that too that i and i watched that whole interminable keynote
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.280]  they didn't show as many apps as anywhere near as many apps as apple did when they showed iowa
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:58.800]  7 and and you know i think it speaks to the way apple works where a apple apple did redesign
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:05.120]  every single part of ios you know all the apps mail and calendar and you know everything
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.760]  and it's the way you know let's face it you know you can admit it you've you've even said you've
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:15.200]  read the hick but let's face it you you designed stuff mostly by you look at what apple's done
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.320]  you digest it and internalize okay here's the way it's supposed to be and then you kind of shoot
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.120]  from the hip you go from your gut and you know it you know you don't sit there with the hick open
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:32.320]  and you know okay it says 16 points between these two things so i'll make these two 16 points i mean
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.920]  so at some point you go and you you know make sure you've got everything like that right but
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.760]  at the when you've got photoshop open you're you're creating art not a description right and
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.400]  the i say this all the time but the g in hig is guidelines right i think of the hig more as like
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.680]  the uh the instructions that come with a new device or your toaster or something like you
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.760]  you might like you're going to look through it and you're going to get the the basics and you might
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.520]  refer to it later but it's not you don't leave it sitting next to your toaster so that every time
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.000]  you make toast you read it same thing with like strunk and white or any other writing guidelines
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.560]  for writers a writer doesn't sit there with you know the chicago manual of style open and for each
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.240]  sentence look it up how am i supposed to structure the sentence the writer just writes and then every
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:21.120]  once in a while you run into a sticky situation or your editor will say or somebody who's read it
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.360]  will point to a sentence and say well isn't this ambiguous here you know and then you think oh i
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.840]  do need to look at the guidelines you know let me let me see but yeah while you're actually writing
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.320]  you're in a completely different mode you're not referring to a set of rules you've already
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.960]  internalized them right and either you have that that structure that framework in your head or you
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.680]  don't right and it did seem like google and i think you know i think part of it is just the way
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.000]  google is different than apple and part of it too though is that they're aware that their developer
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.640]  base is different you know i think your point there about uh internalizing it you're you're
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:58.720]  right and that i think is what's telling here is that google is is setting this up to where i mean
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.760]  if you're if you're not a good designer then no amount of documentation is going to make you a
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.200]  good designer right it's i think if i have some kind of objection or if i have a strong opinion
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.680]  about the way google's doing things here it's that they're sort of presenting it as if like okay just
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:18.080]  read this and now you'll be good at it yeah and i think that that's they're probably wrong on that
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.680]  part i think but you know obviously i think you and i i'll even use the word biased we're biased
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:29.120]  in that regard but i do think we we as a whole collectively have talked a lot over the years
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.800]  about how ios the average ios user is different from the average android user and that's one of
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:41.520]  the reasons why raw market share comparisons are are less valid than in many other contexts
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:48.880]  because they're not if the users have different um expectations different reasons for buying
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.760]  the device if they spend different amounts of money if they have different amounts of education
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.720]  if they have different income levels if they live in different places if they tend you know tend to
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.920]  live in different countries it makes a big difference on the value of them collectively
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.000]  as you know can you build a business just addressing these developers
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.200]  i think less spoken about but maybe even just as important is that i think there's very clearly a
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:18.800]  demographic difference between android developers and ios developers in the same way that there was
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.840]  always a difference between windows developers and mac developers yeah i totally agree with that and
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:29.600]  i think it's a a very similar difference you know and that there'll be some companies will design
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.000]  you know have the same teams and have designers who do let's make an app that looks like a
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.480]  similar as we can on ios and android uh and there's develop you know developers and designers who are
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:46.080]  working on both and i'm sure i know i've read blog posts from some of them there are designers
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.520]  you know talented designers who are either fans of android or just the nature of their job is
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:56.480]  that's where they're working uh i'm not trying to make the you know i'm not jumping to any kind of
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.960]  extreme conclusion that there's no good designers working on android and i think that's a really
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:06.400]  extreme conclusion that there's no good designers working on android but i think i feel very
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:12.800]  confident saying that most good mobile ui designers are either ios only or ios first
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:19.040]  right i think that's a some of that is that there's the moving target problem with android
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:26.480]  where uh which device which set of of apis are you designing for yeah which version of the os
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.440]  you're designing for are you designing for a hardware keyboard are you designing for software
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.600]  keyboard is there like a jog dial thing on the side that you use to to navigate or is it all
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:38.400]  touchscreen and for it's it's all it's evened out a little bit it's evened out a lot because i i
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.360]  android especially at the phone level has unified they've gotten rid of all those things like all
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:49.280]  those things that used to be claimed to be a strength of the platform that some of the devices
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.040]  you know if you want a hardware keyboard you can have a hardware keyboard if you want a jog dial
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.080]  you can have a jog dial well none of the phones have those things anymore they're just and that
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.480]  that's good for everybody but it means that there's there's still um there's still some moving target
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.760]  stuff for for android hardware where uh a designer for apple platform you kind of like you know the
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.800]  screen size and you know the resolution and you know how how big a thing needs to be and how you
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:20.880]  hold it and where your thumb ends up and and that plus the fact that most users i'm gonna get in
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:27.200]  trouble for saying this but uh by and large paid software on android does not sell as well as on
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.760]  ios yeah i'm not gonna get in trouble for that i think everybody agrees i was that was the more
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.000]  political version what i wanted to say but it's uh who nobody is gonna spend a ton of time designing
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.800]  software nobody's gonna spend the money to to pay a great designer to make software that nobody's
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.520]  gonna buy yeah i can see that it does make me wonder for so for uh for apps that are always
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.720]  going to be free like a you know like a major an mlb app that is i mean you pay for it but it's
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.880]  like it's so mass market that it it doesn't matter that there's no inherent ios versus android bias
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:04.640]  there necessarily or for something that is like maybe the major league soccer app where you just
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:10.400]  if you're a fan you're going to download it it's free and it's the app exists to help get you
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:15.440]  excited about a different thing like they make their money elsewhere you look like a twitter
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.800]  app or a facebook app it surprises me that there's those companies aren't spending more on android
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:28.160]  design uh me too i don't know why here's a thing that i'm wondering about so i've noticed and i
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:33.440]  think that the new google material design is largely in line with it is like when you look
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:38.480]  at the google maps app for ios you have the google maps app yeah yeah that's the that's my daily use
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:45.440]  maps app uh it looks you know it's it wasn't designed that google maps ios app was not designed
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:53.120]  in isolation from this material design it's not exactly the same but it's you know it the big
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:57.440]  difference is apple has you know and we it comes down to like what we talked about an hour ago
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.720]  about how yosemite and ios 7 look related but they don't look like the same thing whereas material
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:10.000]  design they're they're flat out saying it's meant to look the same on a chromebook and on a tablet
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.080]  and on a phone and i think implicitly because some of the screenshots they've shown showed
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:22.480]  apps with an ios status bar not an android status bar and that i think that they're they're
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.840]  presenting this as a design language that you could use for ios apps too and i think that they
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.320]  themselves have sort of been doing that that their apps to me have always you know started looking a
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:37.920]  little bit more like moon man ios apps that's going to be a little tricky because they would
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.880]  have to give out some kind of i don't know framework or sdk to make those apis work on
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.200]  iphone well i don't know if they're i don't know if they're going to mean for third-party developers
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:50.800]  to do that or if it's just something they're doing themselves internally but don't you think like
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:55.280]  when i look at maps like they've got like a back button that uses an arrow instead of a chevron
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:03.600]  and it doesn't it doesn't slide from the side ios apple's relationship with google right now is such
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.120]  that i write that a lot of that off as just google saying screw you google's like we're just gonna do
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.840]  our own thing we don't care if it looks like an iphone app but it doesn't you know it it's close
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.400]  enough they're related enough it's not like windows phone which windows phone is a very
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:24.880]  different metaphor right right it would really stick out whereas this is two takes on the same
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:31.360]  basic idea yeah and i think i mean like i said google maps is my daily use maps app and i don't
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:38.320]  find myself thinking that i don't hate it i don't feel grossed out by its googleness but it doesn't
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.400]  look like an ios 7 app right and i wonder like i feel like they're going that route with like gmail
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:50.080]  and stuff too because that's the other app that's the one app they did show off in the keynote and
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:58.720]  i have to say the new gmail app looks so much better than um than it used to look yeah i haven't
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.800]  seen it yeah but i you know it's i i don't understand the people who use the the gmail
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.080]  web interface or the like i just used the stock mail app yeah well the new gmail app looks a lot
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.880]  more it used to like on android it looked like a web app and just even though it was a native app
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:21.520]  it just looked just just the spacing the typography was just horrible yeah really really bad
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.320]  uh last thing i wanted to talk about and this is from io is is that in broad terms i guess i want
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.200]  to write about it on daring fireball too this is the thing i've been thinking about ever since is
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.400]  that there's all sorts of details if we and i love to examine the details you know we spend you know
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.400]  we could spend the whole show just talking about the difference between alvetica and roboto font
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:47.920]  but if you zoom out take the 10 000 foot perspective it's kind of remarkable and i think
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:56.080]  unremarked upon just how similar we targeted google and apple's initiatives are right a tech
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:03.840]  company talking about uh you know set top devices that run the mobile os and have an app store
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:11.520]  and wearables and watchables and health tracking and heart rate monitors and footstep monitors and
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:19.440]  an api for apps to track those things um you know and i know that the apple wrist wearable is still
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:24.080]  a rumor not a thing but i mean it's it's one of those rumors that has an awful lot of smoke and
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:28.000]  everybody's talking about it and people have been talking about an improved apple tv with an app
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.520]  store for years the health and fitness tracking apple announced the you know the health apis home
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:41.600]  automation they're both talking about that google bought nest apple you know flat out came out with
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.800]  ios 8 and said you know here we're adding these things and we're working with all these companies
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.680]  to set your garage door opener and you know your thermostats and whatever can all be hooked up
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:58.720]  notably nest was not on that list right very noticeably um it's all the same sort of basic
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:03.040]  ideas right a car integration there's another obvious one yeah and you can say that all this
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:09.760]  stuff is obvious but they're both all those things are on both companies agendas how much of that do
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:15.920]  you think is me too how much of it do you think is that's just where like even in a vacuum both
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:20.560]  companies would have ended up here i don't know i find it remarkable to me it's very remarkable
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:26.000]  that they're all all of those things i just mentioned are all on are both on both companies
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.880]  agendas i mean because i think i think i know enough to say i don't know enough to say that
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:38.400]  apple is coming out with a wearable device that you wear on your wrist but i do know enough i can
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.200]  say with certainty that they have investigated it thoroughly and that if they don't it's because
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.640]  they rejected it that they've you know that they had people who i know were working on a wearable
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:56.640]  for your wrist so they at least looked at it uh all of those things right watches or i call them
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.040]  wrist wearables because i'm not convinced that that they're the ones that are going to be
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:04.800]  successful are going to be watch like but let's say something you wear your wrist health fitness
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.560]  tracking home automation car integration tv set tops to all the same things i just find that
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.600]  remarkable that both companies have their sights set on all those things oh i mean what else even
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:21.520]  is there what else could they get into yeah i don't know if it's if it's just that they're all
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:28.080]  such obvious ideas for expansion or i almost see it as a byproduct of the relationship between
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.440]  apple and google now where they're so like i for a long time you'd say that they're friends
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:39.200]  and and i think we might be moving either in the middle of or right at the end of frenemies
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.600]  territory and it's about to get ugly yeah i would say we're past that i think they're in arch rival
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.640]  territory i really think it's already there yeah i do i think it's been there ever since the the
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.400]  uh i think it's been there for years ever since the steve jobs internal apple thing that don't
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:59.680]  be evil is bullshit you know i think it's been that way since then i mean outwardly like the
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.640]  way they behave to each other in public because even even after that it was still the maps app
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.800]  was powered by google yeah but only because it had to be and they switched you know they switched
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:13.600]  before probably a year before they were ready but had to do it anyway because they couldn't
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:20.800]  get an extra year you know it was very contentious you know i know i don't know i still don't know
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:26.640]  exactly i'd love to know in hindsight how much of it was um and i know forestall took the blame for
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.120]  that for the you know the the seriously lacking quality of it and as it debuted and i think that
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:39.040]  the gist i don't know this for a fact i think this this is all third hand but the gist is that that
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.320]  that the the maps team led the rest of apple to think no it's not going to be as good as google
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.240]  maps it's going to be problems we're going to take a hit on this but that here's where we are
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:55.280]  you know the bar if 100 is as good as google maps we're at 75 and you know given all the other
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.160]  considerations you know that's why we should go ahead and do it now because we're only going to
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:05.920]  get from 75 to 100 once we have real world usage data and can improve it but then when it shipped
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:12.240]  but then when it shipped it was like at 40 on a scale of one to 100 and that there was less than
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.480]  what the internal team had promised even if what they had promised was not as good as google maps
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.280]  like nobody in apple nobody thought oh we're going to make this transition and it's going to be just
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.360]  as good i mean everybody knew you could just look at certain maps and see it didn't have as much
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.920]  detail and not even that but uh transit transit directions yeah well yeah exactly which you know
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:38.640]  they're only adding now right isn't that isn't that in ios 8 or am i misremembering uh if if it
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.200]  is i missed it well but obviously they knew that they were losing out on transit directions which
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.040]  by the way is the reason that i switched using google maps as my my maps yeah that's huge living
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.960]  new york i need i need to know which train to take yeah absolutely you know if you live in an
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.200]  area where you depend on public transportation it's you know it's like night or day right it's
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:00.160]  like having a weather app that doesn't even show your location it is it's true you know like i
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.280]  think like when dark sky shipped it was like i think they only had like a u.s data source so
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:09.760]  i know there have been some weather apps that only have u.s weather well then you know doesn't matter
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:15.760]  how cool the app is if you live in europe it's you know worthless um you know if if you take the
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.600]  subway to get to get places in new york city apple maps isn't going to help you at all um
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:28.080]  but i'm curious whether if you know and i think it was a problem for forestall and and uh you know
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:35.840]  in terms of uh accountability that it wasn't as good as it was supposed to have been and as they
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:39.360]  were led to have been but i don't know that they still wouldn't have switched at the same time
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:44.480]  anyway it's just that maybe they would have positioned it different marketing wise to set
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:51.600]  the expectations lower because they were in such a tight spot in terms of google demanding really
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:59.200]  deep access to users personal location data in exchange for the things that apple really needed
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:05.280]  from google which were vector-based maps instead of bitmap maps and drive driving directions you
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.640]  know and the thing that you really need for a good maps database is data and they they even
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:14.160]  said like the more you use it the better the service is going to get right and so i think
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:20.560]  maybe in in a perfect or semi-perfect world they would have maybe because like what else did they
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:26.640]  have that wound up being way better after more people used it because of data serie yeah uh so
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:31.760]  maybe they would have like launched this alongside the maps app is like the uh like new maps beta
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:36.640]  i don't know how they could have done it if their relationship was better but given the state of
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:41.040]  their relationships i actually think even knowing how bad the initial version of maps was going to
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.600]  be that they did the right thing i think the wrong thing was that they didn't present they didn't
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.000]  lower expectations and they could have even been more forthright about the fact that it was
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.400]  contentious you know that you know you know i don't know there's some way that they could
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.960]  have presented it that would have lowered expectations accordingly and yeah it's a it's
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.800]  tough to sell it that way yeah but it's better than what they went through though i mean you
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.040]  can say that's tough to sell but it's a lot tougher to say wow new maps is going to be
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:14.240]  awesome and then you got the maps and your house wasn't listed i just mean that uh it's it's i'm
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:17.920]  trying to imagine apple getting up and like what do they say how do they point out how contentious
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:22.240]  the relationship well maybe that maybe that they couldn't get into but somehow they could have said
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.800]  look we're you know we're switching to this and it's going to protect you know they could emphasize
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:32.720]  the protection of privacy which is true it's absolutely you know there's no spin involved
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:38.480]  there you could say it's been by emphasizing the the privacy protection um because that was the
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:45.520]  bottom line is that google was demanding access to user identifiable personal location data
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.080]  in exchange for all of the things that apple needed to improve maps using google maps
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.000]  and there was you know that there was no going forward from that and they had to announce the
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.640]  switch you know they couldn't announce the switch mid-year they had to you know the contract was up
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:05.520]  they i think to renew it you know google might have asked for more than one year it was either
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:12.320]  do it now when the contract's up or you know go through the the pain of having all this you know
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.760]  succumb to google's demands for user data which they weren't going to do you know it's it's an
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.240]  interesting point the contentiousness of the relationship because people like you and me
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:28.240]  knew that but that's not everyone who uses an iphone no right and apple knows that and doesn't
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:34.000]  expect for apple's internal negotiation problems to be you know that's apple's apple knows that
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.600]  that's their problem not the user's problem but you know that's an instance where it it effectively
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.000]  became the user's problem it's an interesting thought experiment that i go back and think about
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.520]  you know just yesterday it was the seven year anniversary of when the first iphone shipped
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:53.680]  and think you know i don't know why everybody was making i mean i even posted a few photos comparing
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:59.520]  the two but you know why is seven a big deal i don't i'm not quite sure but uh you know june 29th
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:05.600]  is like iphone day um and it's interesting to go back to seven years ago and think about how you
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.000]  know the google was a partner in the iphone right and eric schmidt was called on stage in the
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.280]  keynote where it was introduced and it was all hugs and smiles he was a board member at apple
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:20.080]  and there was this whole look we'll make the awesome device and google will provide the awesome
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:28.240]  you know cloud services like maps and youtube it's interesting to think where we'd be today if that
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:34.160]  relationship had stayed like that and google hadn't gone into android and built their own
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:39.760]  competitor to the iphone and was the you know there was more of a happy relationship there
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.920]  i don't think it would have lasted anyway because i think even without android google would have
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:50.960]  demanded the same it wouldn't have changed google's thirst for privacy invasive collection of user
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:56.320]  data i mean you could argue that it's a good thing even i mean it may be annoying for apple that
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:01.520]  google did what they did with android but at the same time that relationship has evolved
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:06.240]  where the i mean the rivalry of that relationship is such that we're going to win out in a big way
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:12.320]  if both companies are making all of these different kinds of things at the same time
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:18.560]  that means we as consumers get a choice and we're we've got two very powerful companies with a lot
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:23.600]  of technology behind them fighting out who can make the better thing yeah i don't know i kind
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:30.160]  of feel like google's business model existed in apple's blind spot at the time that it just never
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.800]  like microsoft apple understood right they're going to make a competing platform and they're
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:40.960]  going to sell it for 15 a pop to oems you know they understood that they didn't use the same
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.880]  business model but i think that they saw like their potential competitors for the iphone as
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.960]  being companies like rim you know making their own doing the i you know the same thing as apple
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.160]  making the whole widget the os the services the the devices and something like microsoft where
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:05.120]  somebody would sell a commercial system to oems for a profit i think the whole idea of we're just
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:11.120]  going to give it away for free and sell things at cost and make it up by collecting user data and
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:17.600]  using that data to sell advertising it i think it existed in a blind spot for apple so you think that
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:22.080]  just they they wouldn't have expected google to make this kind of stuff yeah i don't think that
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.920]  i don't think that that apple in 2007 when they agreed hey and you know because it you know the
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:32.400]  stories that have come out since or that the maps app was a relative late edition but it was like
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.000]  hey what if we did this what if we had maps and we have gps and we can triangulate location with cell
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.120]  you know towers and we could get a really cool what if we work with google and get a really cool
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:50.080]  version of maps and it was cool right it was a really you know that was uh uh one of those things
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.520]  that made the iphone not a phone you know it was like this new thing you had a live updating maps
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:59.520]  in your hand it was amazing you know i didn't know that it was a late edition but that makes sense
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.800]  and it shows that uh because the first iphone didn't have gps yeah yeah it didn't have gps i
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:09.840]  think it i think it was entirely cell phone triangulation and wi-fi you know yeah the the
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:15.520]  network of known wi-fi locations um because i remember with the early one too if you um
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:23.120]  if you had like a new wi-fi like i had i used to carry around a little airport express like in my
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.800]  suitcase i guess i still take it some places but you know that way i would hook up to the
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.720]  hote instead of using the hotel's wi-fi i'd use the ethernet and use the hotel's ethernet and set
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:37.680]  up my own wi-fi uh the iphone had no idea where i was until i like got off the wi-fi and got on the
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:45.440]  cellular um i don't know i don't know where where we would be to think that that was a shipping
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.560]  thing i mean maybe that's the the thing about the seven years is looking back and thinking like
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:56.400]  like how primitive was this thing it was so advanced at the time but from in only seven
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:03.920]  years it's become i don't know almost a little folksy to think to think about an iphone shipping
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:13.360]  without gps yeah or with a truly shitty camera it's crazy um it was like it shipped with like
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.160]  a really nice cell phone camera and what i used to think of as cell phone camera quality uh yeah
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.080]  because i going to get i had to do this thing because yesterday i took photos side by side
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.960]  photos with the 5s and the original iphone and i had to figure out how to get the photos
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:34.000]  from the old iphone to my new iphone to post them to twitter and i didn't want to go through the
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.120]  mac i was just sitting there watching uh soccer games and stuff and i couldn't figure it out
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.280]  because i couldn't send text messages because i didn't have an so i didn't have a sim card for
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:49.680]  the old iphone um it was running an old version of ios that didn't have iMessage yet i was like
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.840]  how the hell do i do that so of course that you know old reliable email you can always email
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:04:01.760]  yourself something yeah um and i went to email the photo and just emailed it to myself but it didn't
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.920]  ask me do you want to send small medium or large it just sent it and i was like oh that's weird i
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:10.800]  don't remember that and then it showed up on my new iphone a couple seconds later and one was only
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:17.600]  like 109k i was like ah it shrunk it and then i realized nope that's how small the photos that
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:24.720]  was it didn't ask because the full-size photo was was only like 200 kilobytes it's tiny that's crazy
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:29.200]  all right last thing i know we've gone long this is long even by talk show standards but to me it's
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:35.840]  emblematic of the differences is is the car stuff isn't shipping yet um the home automation stuff
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:41.840]  isn't really shipping yet i know that there's some new stuff with nest uh the one thing that's
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:48.320]  started to ship are the watches right and now they last week at io they shipped the first two
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:55.040]  google wear watches and they had on site they didn't give them to people yet the the prototypes
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.600]  of the mo or not prototypes but like early production models of the moto 360 which is the
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:06.960]  round one uh-huh it doesn't even use the whole circle yeah at the bottom you need the thing at
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:12.960]  the bottom right it's not actually round there's actually i thought it was a bug and then i read
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:18.240]  i read a thing so if you look at the pictures of the moto 360 at the very bottom of the front face
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:25.280]  like at the six o'clock area there's a small black bar like it's almost like a bottom letterboxing
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:31.280]  of a few pixels at the bottom of the screen and apparently that's a feature not a bug it's where
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:35.840]  the displayed they call them the display drivers are i don't even know what that means display
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.800]  drivers but i guess it's in other words for some technical reason they couldn't make the full
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:46.480]  display around i'm gonna call that a bug it just it looks like somebody screwed up cropping an
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:50.800]  instagram picture right well who who when you settle on that who says well good enough
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:58.720]  enough it's it's it looks like a joke it looks uh faith corpi had tweeted that
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:05.040]  it looks like something that would come out of a plastic egg to me it everything about those
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:12.880]  watches emblemizes the difference between google and apple and google fans and apple fans you know
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.760]  and i don't mean it like i don't want to fans may not be but people who tend to be drawn to
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.160]  apple products versus people who tend to be drawn to google products and it's a sensibility
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:29.600]  yeah and it just emphasizes how different we are and in the fact like for example the reaction
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:35.200]  from people who like google stuff and maybe they're you know like people who who still
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:39.360]  are optimistic at google glass is going to be a thing or maybe they own a pair of google glass
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.280]  and they attended io and they were there and they got to choose they uh they gave you either the
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:51.280]  samsung or the lg rectangular watch and they said later in the year we'll give you the we'll send
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:56.480]  you the moto 360 one too and they had the 360s there that you could play with in demo mode but
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:01.840]  you couldn't like take it with you those people and they say i like it i've got my samsung gear
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:08.720]  live on i like it it's it's nice but i you know wow the the motors the moto 360 one is even nicer
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:14.320]  i can't wait for it right you're all they already admit that the one that that shipping is so
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.720]  horrible that they already want the next one it's the name i keep laughing at the name how do you
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:24.160]  call something a 360 when it doesn't form a full circle yeah it should i never even thought of that
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:29.440]  it should be like the the moto 340 or the i don't even know how many degrees that is but it's
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:36.480]  probably like maybe it's like 300 the moto 300 i think that it's such a perfect example of the
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:42.480]  steve jobs adage that you can't start with the technology and work your way back to the product
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:49.280]  you have to start with the design and then find the technology to make it work that they've gone
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.520]  about this completely different and in fact they even said so on stage like the words where
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:58.480]  it's now possible to make a full-powered computer that you can wear on your body
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:04.320]  that the technology now exists to make a you know a little watch sized or vaguely you know maybe
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:08.640]  even if it's a big ass watch but you can make a computer this size that you can wear on your wrist
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:12.720]  the axle would never say that and so here it is here we've made one you know as opposed to
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:17.760]  coming up with here's something you would really want to do and it would and that you would want
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:22.400]  to wear and then we figured out the technology to make it work it's like completely backwards
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:29.920]  it's very different i will eat my hat if apple unveils something in the fall that even vaguely
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:34.880]  resembles these these watches define vaguely resemble well that it's uh
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.640]  it i actually have the thing right here it's a kickstarter project i actually forget the name
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.440]  of it again it's not printed on the watch band but it was a it's a watch band you could buy to
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.840]  put an ipad the square ipod nano in oh yeah um was it the tick tock or something yeah yeah yeah
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.160]  that was it and they sold them in apple stores too yeah and it was a kickstarter project and i
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:00.240]  bought it and and for strapping and i little square ipod nano onto your wrist it was great
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:06.160]  and it's a nice rubber band and i've worn it for listening to music or podcasts while running with
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:12.160]  an ipod nano it's great you put your ipod nano on your wrist and there you go way better
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:20.560]  than strapping a full-size iphone on your arm with an armband because ipod nano is very small
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:27.680]  but these the galaxy gear things are exactly as graceful and elegant and good looking as
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:32.960]  an ipod nano strapped to a third party i think that was never designed to be a watch strapped
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.920]  to your wrist now technically there's obviously big improvements where the ipod nano didn't have
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.840]  any kind of internet access or live connection to your phone it's an independent device and now
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:50.080]  they've got notifications and stuff like that um so there's a big difference in terms of the actual
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.560]  wireless thing but just in terms of aesthetics i just can't believe that that's what they've
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.880]  come up with you know and that the interface is no better than um flipping around a bunch of
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.960]  screens in fact the interface is worse because they don't have any kind of home screen on the
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.720]  watch it's like you've always got these cards that you flick and there's no sense of where i find it
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:16.160]  very confusing in terms of like spatial navigation at least the ipod nano has a home screen where you
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:22.560]  squeeze down and you've got a grid of apps like ios which is still kind of a weird ios
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.360]  which is still kind of a weird ios-ification yeah it just doesn't quite fit on a screen that small
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:35.280]  yeah i do i like the the motor 3c i keep laughing at that name it it as a as a tech demo or as a
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.240]  you know if it if you saw it in a movie and the hero had one that actually did use the full circle
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:46.400]  you'd think that was kind of cool as like movie ui that would look cool in the real world with
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.160]  uh the bar at the bottom when it's weirdly letterboxed like that it just it feels like
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.400]  a joke it feels like this is a half-baked product and they're just trying to get it out the door
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:58.880]  so that they can uh get interest up for the next one it's more about an investment in a
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.800]  hope that that kind of works out but i just don't see how battery is going to work out i don't see
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:08.160]  how uh the ui like i don't know and maybe it's me just not thinking through it enough but it's just
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:14.240]  i've not seen one of these things with a good user experience that that would stand up yeah i
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  and i have a pebble which it seems it's broadly similar i mean that google now stuff is a total
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.040]  difference and but i don't give google my personal information i don't i don't put my flight
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.320]  information into google it's always the demos are always about goddamn flights too and it's like
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:38.000]  you know i i've uh you know i don't know who if i i've never had a flight on my watch before but
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.400]  i've never missed a flight so i don't know that that's how great a demo that is um maybe i need
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:49.520]  that but i've had a device paired with my phone that shows all notifications from my phone on my
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:55.040]  wrist and makes my wrist buzz when my phone gets a notification and it's doesn't doesn't seem
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:02.240]  helpful at all it doesn't doesn't good for me at all i mean i don't think this is going to be any
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.880]  more popular than pebble i don't think just showing notifications on your wrist is useful
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:12.160]  i do kind of like the idea of uh the whippings watch that you linked to the other day right the
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:16.000]  activity i don't even know how you're supposed to say that's how i would have said it the only
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.160]  thing i don't like about the thing is its name but it's it's a nice looking watch right it's
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.880]  not awful even the website it's all attractive fashionable people doing interesting things and
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.440]  there's like the woman is even swimming on the thing it has a wee bit of bluetooth and it does
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:39.680]  and it does uh foot or distance tracking i think it has a swim mode too so you can and i know that
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:42.560]  i think i've seen from other people who are activity trackers that swimming has always
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:48.400]  been a little difficult um so you just you look at it though and it it strikes you as
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.400]  it's it's not i mean there's no digital display right it is truly analog but maybe that's a
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:57.280]  smarter idea maybe there's something to be done with that yeah i don't know if it's good for
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:02.320]  everybody like to me like i've said i think you could sell as well as a typical 400 watch which
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:08.080]  it in apple's terms means not at all but in terms of you know people who make watches could be a
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:12.240]  fine little side business you know is it is it a sort of thing that a hundred million people are
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.720]  going to buy no i don't think there's any chance of that is it something a couple of ten thousand
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:21.520]  people would buy sure well it kind of makes me wonder because it's just i mean it's a watch and
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.880]  it's got that dial and the dial is it just the needle moves from zero to 100 and and that's the
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:33.680]  kind of thing that anybody any watchmaker could add that feature yeah i i could see that becoming
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:39.360]  like a new and you know that those sort of features becoming a bigger part of traditional
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.080]  watch design yeah it could be that the next seamaster has that thing in it well that would
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:48.720]  be deceived like a rolex would be different because a rolex isn't electronic at all that's
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:53.600]  to me like a mechanical watch might be cut out of all of this because there's no electronics at all
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:59.840]  which is sort of the the aesthetic beauty of a mechanical watch but like the withings watch is
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:06.080]  a quartz watch and it takes a standard watch battery um but it has to be electronic to do
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.840]  any kind of bluetooth uh yeah i haven't thought about but but most of the watches most people buy
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:16.800]  in the world are quartz watches not mechanical watches so i still think that that that the
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.440]  highest end you know the mechanical automatic watches are still not going to be part of this
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:28.080]  but the vast majority of traditional watches are quartz and could be i think it's time but i think
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:32.400]  that's part of i think the fact that it runs it it's advertised to run for a year on a standard
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.160]  watch battery is part of that whole hey design is how it works like not having to worry about
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:45.280]  the battery more than once a year is an enormous difference from the gear watches which by all
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:51.440]  accounts so far need to be charged daily like asking someone to add another device that you have
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:59.120]  to charge every day is i think it's an enormous uh barrier and in some cases a device that would
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:04.880]  take up uh another ip address might not matter for you or me at home but for for uh corporate types
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.880]  yeah maybe i don't know i don't know do they need an ip address i thought it was all bluetooth
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.680]  yeah i think so i don't know i'm just i'm kind of like imagining futurecast right i think that
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:19.760]  we all blindly tolerate the fact that we have to charge our phones every day because the phones
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:26.000]  and you know our we can't we none of us want to go back to pre iphone smartphone life it's worth
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.440]  it even though it's an enormous hassle whereas at some point in the decades to come maybe the decade
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:35.680]  to come we're not going to have to charge our phone every day and we're going to look back on
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:42.560]  the days when we'd go to the airport and everybody was fighting over electrical sockets and grown
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:47.760]  men wearing suits are sitting on the floor of the airport so that they can be near a power charger
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.560]  because their phone was dead at three in the afternoon we're going to look back and think
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:58.240]  my god we live like animals uh adding another device with that sort of constant need for
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.200]  charging is an enormous hassle and it has to add to make it worthwhile that people would actually
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:10.080]  go through with it it has to add a lot of utility i think whereas oh i don't have to take my phone
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:14.400]  out of my pocket to see who just texted me i can just look at my wrist it to me doesn't cross that
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:21.040]  barrier it doesn't even come close and the the best case scenario is not you making your flight
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:26.720]  the best case scenario is not i mean even having maps data on your wrist isn't compelling enough
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:31.360]  taking my phone out of my pocket is not that hard right i don't think that the difference between
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:39.680]  taking my phone out of my pocket versus flipping my wrist to be watch phase visible is that much
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.040]  of a difference yes it is easier to look at my wrist so on you know and i do wear a regular
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:49.440]  wristwatch when i want to see what time it is i do just look at my wrist i don't take out my phone
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:54.880]  but the difference isn't that great for most things like it totally makes sense to me it makes
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.400]  a lot of sense to me how an awful lot of people especially as they skew younger say i don't
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:05.200]  understand why you'd want to wear a timepiece wristwatch i just look at my phone like it's not
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:10.400]  that big a difference and that to me is the entire reason these things exist other than the fitness
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:17.440]  tracking which there's a lot of awful a lot more subtle solutions out there right if somebody's
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:23.200]  wearing a fitbit you don't know it somebody's wearing a galaxy gear live smartwatch and you
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:28.560]  know it because they've got a giant brick on their wrist well if only they could put it on their face
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:34.080]  right so i think these things are dead on arrival going nowhere and predict that whatever if if
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.880]  apple has something wrist wearable to show this fall that it won't resemble these things at all
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.000]  it's similar to the argument like you saw the i think you can link to it the
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:53.040]  the daily show thing about uh the google glass explorers yes uh the the ability to access that
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:18:00.640]  information it with google glass without looking away from the person it's a similar argument to
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:05.840]  being able to see the time without taking your phone out of your pocket or just to see your
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:09.280]  notifications without taking your phone out of your pocket it takes a certain kind of person
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:13.680]  for that to be worthwhile it feels more like a thing we can do with technology rather than
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:20.320]  solving a real problem yeah i it doesn't seem yeah it just seems like you've solved a very very small
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.240]  problem which is i don't want to take my phone out of my pocket and and you have to have your phone
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.240]  with you you can't go out without your phone and still have a connection because you're out of
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:32.800]  bluetooth range so you can't just go for a run and leave your phone at home and do all the things
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:36.320]  you could do on your phone because you've lost the connection it doesn't solve that like that
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:42.160]  would be a true that would be a real problem you've solved but i think it's a social problem
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:45.360]  because the the real thing you don't want to do is take your phone out to look at a notification
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:49.200]  when you're talking to somebody so you're not they're not solving that problem they're just
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:54.000]  masking it yeah and if you get if you look at your watch and it's an important notification
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.920]  you're gonna have to do it anyway right and if it's not an important notification why are you
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.760]  getting a notification for it and it doesn't the it at no point has it ever been polite to constantly
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:07.200]  check your watch when talking to somebody one of the other things it just drives me nuts whenever
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.320]  i've tried android is android defaults to showing a lot more notifications and all notifications put
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:18.240]  an icon up in the status bar and i noticed during io even in the demos that the cleaned up prepared
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:24.880]  demos for the software the status bar was just chock full of notifications you know there's
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:30.320]  like three gmail icons because you've got three new messages for gmail and it's like i can't
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:33.920]  believe that it doesn't drive people nuts it's like walking into somebody's house and they've
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.080]  they're just so disorganized they got stuff all over the place like dirty dishes out
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:46.800]  says i as i look around my office and i've got like literally like 47 cardboard boxes from amazon
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:51.120]  yeah but if you're going to show pictures of your your home right you've you've cleaned it up now
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:59.200]  well we keep my office door closed yeah i don't know i can't help but think that that it that
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:04.000]  this is going to be another one of those things where apple shows a wrist wearable that looks
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.160]  nothing like these things does something different and the other thing too and that's just to tie it
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:12.560]  all up is go back seven years celebrate the iphone anniversary the other thing about the original
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:18.560]  iphone seven years ago is when they first shipped it or first showed it on stage it seemed too good
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:24.400]  to be true there was this and and famously like rim had like a meeting the next day where they
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:29.120]  they just their conclusion was apple is lying about the capabilities of this device because
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:35.280]  it can't do the things that they're saying it doesn't last all day right there's nothing about
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:44.880]  these google uh where the android wear watches even the the moto 320 um that makes anybody say
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:49.280]  i can't believe that they were able to build that this year well it doesn't help that they're
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:53.280]  sitting there telling everybody how it works like that's google's whole thing is talking about well
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:58.080]  here's how we got this to get to work yeah but there's no aspect of the technology that that
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:05.840]  that is surprising or seems like wow that should that seems like it's from the future it's that
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:14.160]  sort of android google linux philosophy thing anytime you see uh even even the more popular
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:20.320]  linux apps or or the things that google it all has that air of people sitting around like a like
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:26.080]  a modern day version of those electronics kits you could buy at radio shack like here's the stuff and
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.240]  here's what we can do with the stuff and now i made you a radio right which is cool if it's a
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:36.240]  bunch of kids you know making a hobby type thing or a university project right and is pointless if
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:43.120]  it's a major initiative from uh you know one of the 10 biggest corporations in the world that
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:48.240]  wants to make a product for a billion people right like if i went over to tish and there was a kid
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:54.560]  showing off a wearable that that was like google glass i'd be really impressed right or the or the
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:22:00.640]  or the same thing with these watches right it would be very very impressive but i look at google
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:04.560]  and like i got i got shit to do i'm not wearing that right they've presenting they're presenting
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.280]  this as something that maybe millions of people will be buying for christmas this year and i think
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.680]  that it's not going to happen at all i think apple is either a going to show nothing and they're not
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:19.280]  going to get into this or b they're going to show something that's very different and then all of a
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:25.360]  sudden next year's google android wear watches will look an awful lot like the one that apple
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:30.160]  unveiled at the end of 2014 and then all the google people are going to be like yeah but we've
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:35.360]  had we had watches the year before too no big deal just because ours totally changed in the
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:39.600]  next year and happened to change in a way that was exactly like the apple one it was always going to
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.960]  get there right this was just the the nature of it it it's funny before the iphone came out there
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:51.040]  was you know all the rumors about an apple phone an iphone they weren't close to the mark in that
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:57.600]  nobody guessed it uh but there was a lot of imagination people you look at all these mock-ups
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:03.360]  these these fake phones that people put together in photoshop and in 3d rendering software and
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:10.240]  people were people had a lot of interesting ideas of how apple might do a phone there's nothing like
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:16.560]  that for a watch no well and well the other thing though too well again i think that watch is the
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:20.160]  wrong way to look at it but there might be something like that for what you could wear
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:26.400]  on your wrist i don't know i i i am i hope apple has something to show because i think if they do
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:32.000]  it's going to be really interesting and thoughtful and i think it's going to by necessity push the
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:38.080]  boundaries of what we consider technically possible and there's nothing about that with
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:43.680]  the google wear stuff yeah it doesn't feel like magic at all no it just feels like well it seems
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:50.240]  like you know by now you ought to be able to make the equivalent of a 200 you know an ipod nano with
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:56.720]  with bluetooth right as of today i'm not excited at all about apple making a wearable
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:04.000]  thing that i put on my wrist i if they do it i hope that in true apple style it'll be suddenly
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:09.920]  i'll be salivating over the thing yeah i well i'm my optimism is is because not because i i have
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:14.160]  a good imagination of what it would do because i don't i'm with you on that i can't imagine what
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:17.840]  they would make that would make me want to wear it but my it's my confidence that they're only
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:22.400]  going to ship something if they have an answer to that question that i just haven't thought about
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:27.280]  because i honestly i'm the big difference from 2007 is i the reason i was blown away is i really
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:33.120]  i would have considered impossible before the keynote to have a quote-unquote stripped down
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:37.920]  version of os 10 running on a phone i if somebody would have said to me before here's what i think
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.280]  they're going to do is they're going to show uh they're going to have an iphone and it's going to
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:46.320]  run like a stripped down version of ios 10 for touch screens and i would have my response would
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.720]  have been well that's not possible yet maybe in the future but not yet they can't do that yet
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:54.960]  yeah i would i would have agreed with that so i think that the whatever apple is going to have
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:59.520]  for your wrist is going to be that sort of thing like i didn't think that was possible yet but here
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.440]  it is i think that that's really going to come down to battery i think that's gonna be the big
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:09.520]  shot well and that's why i think that the weird thing i i think that the the focus on iphone
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:17.280]  android style lcd displays in the android wear is i wouldn't be surprised at all if that's the
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:21.520]  biggest reason they only get one day of battery life is because it's got to be because the display
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:25.440]  because the display takes so much of the battery you know like i said with jonas before like his
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.360]  he gets terrible battery life because he runs at full brightness the display is still it's just an
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:34.320]  enormous enormous drain didn't steve job say that at one point that the biggest drain on battery in
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:41.120]  the iphone was the display yeah it's like an open secret i mean it's just simple you know it's just
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.520]  you're lighting up millions of little light bulbs this is why i think that withings activitae
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:51.360]  steampunk approach is pretty smart yeah i don't i i would actually i'll just go so far as to say
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:56.880]  i think i'd be very surprised if apple's wearable is an iphone style display on your wrist i and i
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.680]  don't know if it'll be no display i don't know if it's like a thing that just collects data i but i
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:06.240]  don't i just don't see how running a display and therefore only getting one day of battery life
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.520]  anything desirable comes out of that yeah i don't know all right i think we're filled up the hour
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:19.120]  let's wrap it up dave whiskus uh people can can find you on twitter at what's your username this
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:27.520]  week at d whiskus d whisk us to it and uh you got your own professional with uh jamie newberry and
