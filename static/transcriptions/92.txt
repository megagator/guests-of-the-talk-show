[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  breaking news. You see Steve Ballmer stepped down from the Microsoft board.
[00:03.920 --> 00:07.800]  I did. I did. I love him so much. So it's hard for me.
[00:07.800 --> 00:12.260]  I'm kind of happy for him though, because I feel like he's, he's already, he's already
[00:12.260 --> 00:14.280]  got like a big new thing.
[00:14.280 --> 00:20.320]  Yeah, no, he's found, he's found his next windows, you know?
[00:20.320 --> 00:25.720]  Yeah. Did you see the video of him at the, the like clappers opening? So good. He's going
[00:25.720 --> 00:29.480]  to be such a great owner. Clippers fans don't know how good they're going to get it.
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.160]  I mean, this just could have been like this, probably what he should have been doing for
[00:33.160 --> 00:34.720]  20 years.
[00:34.720 --> 00:42.480]  I do. I kind of, I do kind of feel like that. I do. And I feel like, you know, I mean, as
[00:42.480 --> 00:48.160]  a Yankees fan, I'm partial to the bigger than life owner, like George Steinbrenner, which
[00:48.160 --> 00:55.600]  is exactly what Ballmer is, except maybe he's maybe a little, a little bit, believe it or
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.840]  not a little bit less angry.
[00:59.840 --> 01:03.960]  I mean, the guy goes, how to keep his cool though. Have you ever seen the video on YouTube
[01:03.960 --> 01:10.360]  where he's at like a German press conference and somebody throws something at him?
[01:10.360 --> 01:12.860]  Oh yeah. Yeah.
[01:12.860 --> 01:17.560]  And he does, he's completely unfazed. Like it doesn't really bother him. Right. You know?
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.000]  And he just like keeps spouting Microsoft propaganda and like, it doesn't really matter
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.840]  at all to him that he just got hit in the face by some German.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  Yeah.
[01:26.840 --> 01:27.840]  Yeah.
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.400]  And I can't help but think too. I mean, number one, he's super competitive guy. I mean, he
[01:32.400 --> 01:35.580]  wants to win. This is a guy, he didn't buy the Clippers just to own a team. He wants
[01:35.580 --> 01:42.920]  to win NBA titles. Whereas the old owner, the, the dingbat racist guy, Sterling, for
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.360]  decades, the Clippers were like a joke in the NBA and they only got good in the last
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.580]  few years by, by luck, by a trade that nobody thought was going to be good. That turned
[01:51.580 --> 01:56.760]  out to be fantastic for him. So it's great news for the Clippers fans because he's going
[01:56.760 --> 02:01.800]  to want to win. And I can't help but think that like his tech background is going to
[02:01.800 --> 02:08.520]  make, you know, sort of as the NBA sort of pushes in that money ball direction of looking
[02:08.520 --> 02:12.480]  at stats and metrics that people didn't look at before. And I think that's one reason Mark
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.900]  Cuban has been a good owner for the Dallas Mavericks, that they've been pretty successful.
[02:16.900 --> 02:20.100]  Now I've gotten into this like rapid thing of finding, you know, there was that thing
[02:20.100 --> 02:23.960]  that he threw a, threw a chair across a room a couple of years ago.
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.200]  Right. It was like when, when there was like a key employee who he wanted to, he wanted
[02:28.200 --> 02:32.360]  to keep and the guy was like, you know what, I think I'm going to Google and, and right.
[02:32.360 --> 02:35.080]  The guy's like, you know what, there's nothing you can say. I'm going to Google. And he like
[02:35.080 --> 02:41.200]  threw a chair. But to your point, like there's no, you know, this is a passionate, passionate,
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.400]  passionate man. Yeah. And chair throwing has like a nice history in basketball. Bobby,
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.220]  Bobby Knight, the old college coach at, at Indiana used to used to like throwing chairs
[02:50.220 --> 02:55.960]  or referees. Not sure that'll fly on the court, but well, I think I will definitely disappoint
[02:55.960 --> 03:00.520]  you for the next hour or whatever. We're going to be talking about talking about sports because
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.220]  no, we're talking about Steve Ballmer's personality. Yeah, yeah. I'm just saying I can't really
[03:05.220 --> 03:12.840]  throw the same. No, you know, curveball, if you will. Is that good? Is that good? Can
[03:12.840 --> 03:18.600]  we edit in some laugh track there?
[03:18.600 --> 03:22.560]  And I do think I think it's kind of I there were rumors that he was not going to be long
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.860]  on the Microsoft board that, you know, that the public relations wise, it's, you know,
[03:27.860 --> 03:38.160]  it was a orderly transition. But it was it's more like a divorce than a, you know, amicable
[03:38.160 --> 03:46.360]  break up transition. Which is sad. Yeah, it kind of is. Because boy, they have a good
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.920]  run. Yeah, a good run. And you know, that'll talk about dedication to a company. I mean,
[03:52.920 --> 03:56.880]  like, you know, that's what we're talking about this passion. He's, he's so passionate
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.600]  about Microsoft, like it. And I even you know, when he had stepped down, or when the resignation
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.600]  thing happened, I was like, you know, that's, that's a sad thing to lose for a company,
[04:06.600 --> 04:12.680]  which is like a CEO that is just that incredibly passionate about, about everything that comes
[04:12.680 --> 04:13.680]  out of that company.
[04:13.680 --> 04:19.920]  Yeah, like he, you know, he was never one of these guys who was just going to be a CEO
[04:19.920 --> 04:26.840]  of a company. And that maybe someday he would leave and go to Oracle, you know, right now,
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.440]  that was never going to happen. He was a Microsoft guy. Yeah, well, he has, you know, I love
[04:31.440 --> 04:37.240]  this company. It was like, yeah, he did. He really Oh, he does. I'm sure he still does.
[04:37.240 --> 04:40.560]  That's what he says in that letter. You read, did you read the letter he posted on OneDrive?
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.600]  No, I did not.
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.080]  I obviously tweeted that he could have used Clippy's help to format the letter because
[04:48.080 --> 04:56.560]  the letter is literally like, dear Satya, paragraphs, Steve, like, it's like, really,
[04:56.560 --> 05:02.000]  after all this time, you couldn't have just used one of the templates and word. tweeted
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.440]  the link here, but
[05:05.440 --> 05:09.920]  well, you have been super busy this month. You're all I guess you're always busy, but
[05:09.920 --> 05:15.000]  you're not one of these taken off for August people now. And guess who guess who's getting
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.580]  married right before or right after the iPhone launch or the rumored iPhone launch? Right
[05:20.580 --> 05:29.320]  before right after? Well, if things go according to rumor and speculation, or if they follow
[05:29.320 --> 05:36.960]  a historical pattern, we will see an announcement on Tuesday, September, when it will get married
[05:36.960 --> 05:44.100]  on that Sunday on the 14th. And then an iPhone would probably as historically has happened
[05:44.100 --> 05:48.840]  launch the week after or the week after that I'm assuming the week after Yeah, I think
[05:48.840 --> 05:54.080]  that Yeah, usually on a Friday, so I'm guessing the 19th. Yeah, so I you know, I picked a
[05:54.080 --> 06:00.400]  great time to get married. Are you immediately? Well, congratulations, number one, but number
[06:00.400 --> 06:06.520]  two, are you Thank you. Are you immediately leaving on a honeymoon? Or now that the honeymoon
[06:06.520 --> 06:11.160]  is scheduled for a different different time. honeymoon is scheduled for the end of October
[06:11.160 --> 06:17.280]  beginning of November. Alright, so your review in theory, you your your iPhone review could
[06:17.280 --> 06:21.920]  your camera pictures could be from the bride's perspective of the wedding. That'd be kind
[06:21.920 --> 06:31.280]  of amazing. Well, yes, but you the other bride, my my fiance, she will probably murder me
[06:31.280 --> 06:41.600]  if I'm reviewing an iPhone during the week of the wedding. Yeah, that reminds me Oh,
[06:41.600 --> 06:45.320]  that reminds me of the funniest thing from the summer, which was you were a bridesmaid
[06:45.320 --> 06:52.200]  and in a friend's wedding, and you were testing the the Android wear smartwatches. She told
[06:52.200 --> 06:57.360]  you that if you tried to wear it during the weddings, you're out. Right? Totally. It totally
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.200]  happens. Like I wore that to the rehearsal dinner the night before. And she was like,
[07:01.200 --> 07:06.880]  what is that? I was like, it's just my it's my new watch. It's my new smartphone glued
[07:06.880 --> 07:13.280]  to my to my wrist. And she's like, if you wear that tomorrow, don't even come. And so
[07:13.280 --> 07:17.880]  I you know, yes, I had to stage a little bit of this of the soundbite when she was in her
[07:17.880 --> 07:24.040]  beautiful dress. But that was that was very much a true story. Yeah. But anyway, congratulations.
[07:24.040 --> 07:27.400]  But you're gonna go you'll probably go you'll you'll still be out for the event assuming
[07:27.400 --> 07:30.700]  everything again, assuming every we talked about it, like it's a done deal. But assuming
[07:30.700 --> 07:37.080]  everything happens as as expected, you'll be out for the event and then come back east
[07:37.080 --> 07:45.040]  later in the week. Right? Yeah, yeah. If Yes, exactly. I do think I do think that that is
[07:45.040 --> 07:50.160]  going to happen. That, you know, the rumors are true. And I mean, that makes sense given
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.600]  the timing. But it's funny to have watching the rest of the industry line up around that.
[07:56.600 --> 08:03.440]  Because everybody I think Samsung has an event. Or Oh, I'm, I'm very busy leading up to this
[08:03.440 --> 08:09.240]  wedding. And very busy. I think that the Samsung one is going to be on the third. It's like,
[08:09.240 --> 08:12.680]  you know, do you want to go after Do you want to go before and I think most people are like,
[08:12.680 --> 08:17.760]  Oh, we will Samsung is usually does this before because Eva out of Berlin is the same is the
[08:17.760 --> 08:24.040]  same time every year. And so they do the note announcement there. And you know, Sony announces
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.800]  some stuff that I'm not really sure people notice. And who else does stuff around there?
[08:29.800 --> 08:36.680]  Sometimes HTC, but I guess not really this year. And then Motorola has an event like
[08:36.680 --> 08:43.160]  that Friday or that Thursday before? That's the fourth. So yeah, good times.
[08:43.160 --> 08:48.520]  Yeah. And there's the added possibility that that this will be the event. And again, this
[08:48.520 --> 08:53.760]  is just speculation, but it could be that coincident with the iPhone, Apple that will
[08:53.760 --> 09:00.320]  have their wearable stuff long, long rumored, supposedly imminent wearable stuff, if you
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.280]  know, which would probably Well, I don't know, you know, questionable whether that would
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.680]  come out at the same time, maybe the reviews would be, you know, maybe they'd announce
[09:08.680 --> 09:12.640]  it then and it would come out a different time. But could be a lot of stuff to review.
[09:12.640 --> 09:17.600]  Well, everyone jumped on something you said a couple of weeks ago, right? Yeah. And by
[09:17.600 --> 09:22.440]  the way, I didn't really read that as like, that was your inside sources. And I know you
[09:22.440 --> 09:29.920]  kind of refuted that. That's because you're not stupid. I mean, I was cracking a joke.
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.760]  Yeah, I, I would think that was not going to happen at the same event as the iPhone.
[09:33.760 --> 09:37.760]  But that said, I don't I really don't know much. And I think it's really hard to talk
[09:37.760 --> 09:42.080]  about some of this health kit stuff without talking about that product. But I again, I
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.560]  don't really know. Yeah, I talked about this a little bit last
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.760]  week. But it's to me, it was just just a guest trying to crack a joke about what if the moto
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.080]  270 doesn't come out until after Apple announces their thing?
[09:54.080 --> 10:00.680]  Well, it looks like the moto 270 will come out before and it will be close to $270.
[10:00.680 --> 10:08.240]  Yeah. I saw that too. And it made me laugh. No, when do they say that the moto 360 is
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.160]  going to the rumored release date? It's like imminent. It's like, like sometime in the
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.360]  next week or so. I think they are holding this event on September
[10:18.360 --> 10:24.760]  I gotta look through my inbox, but they're holding an event in in September in Chicago,
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.700]  I believe. So that's I didn't see that. Yeah. And then the then the pricing leads this weekend
[10:29.700 --> 10:37.160]  on Best Buy for $250 for the moto 270 or 360. I'm actually excited about this. I mean, I
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.560]  know a lot of people when I put it on at Google IO were people were saying that I was wearing
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.320]  a What were they saying I was wearing on my on my wrist? Some you might have made a great
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.640]  joke about what I was wearing on my wrist. It's possible. I don't remember. I don't know
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.520]  a monocle or something like that. But I mean, you know, it's I think it's the first smart
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.600]  watch that comes closest to looking like a watch definitely is very big. The face is
[11:03.600 --> 11:11.640]  big and I know there's been some issues about how the screen isn't really fully a circle.
[11:11.640 --> 11:16.040]  But it looks cool. Definitely looks better than the than the to the LG and the Samsung
[11:16.040 --> 11:22.520]  that I've that I've worn throughout the summer. Yeah, but I still I concur with your review
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.920]  of the earlier too, though, where it's just highly questionable. Whether I mean, for some
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.360]  people, of course, some people, you know, you can find some people who want everything,
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.280]  you know, any idea under the sun. But the idea of getting a buzz on your wrist every
[11:36.280 --> 11:43.240]  single time you get a notification is to me, it's it sounds like punishment. It is it does.
[11:43.240 --> 11:47.480]  It doesn't appeal to me. And I don't have the type of job. And I don't think many people
[11:47.480 --> 11:55.560]  do where I'm always on on the alert for like an emergency. You know, I could totally see
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.240]  how like, I don't know, somebody who works in a hospital might want to have a watch that
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.920]  that every single time that buzzes, they really do want to look because it could be a serious
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.960]  emergency. I could see that me I don't need that. And when I've had my put my pebble hooked
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.760]  up to my iPhone, and just moving alerts to my wrist, it, it just feels like I'm punishing
[12:16.760 --> 12:17.760]  myself.
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.860]  Right. And then, you know, that's one of the things I had spoken to Google about before
[12:22.860 --> 12:26.900]  the review, and then obviously pointed out in the review is that there needs to be deeper
[12:26.900 --> 12:30.800]  customization of that. But even then, you know, you really wonder, do we want to be
[12:30.800 --> 12:36.160]  sort of futzing with that kind of settings type of thing? I mean, even just dealing with
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.700]  notifications on my phone, is like and setting them up and what apps ping me when they do
[12:41.700 --> 12:47.860]  this, or visit my retweets or its mentions, or if it's email from this account, you know,
[12:47.860 --> 12:53.540]  that in itself is a is a big task to do. So it's easiest for these companies to just say,
[12:53.540 --> 12:58.940]  if it hits the front lock screen of your phone, then it will hit your wrist. But it needs
[12:58.940 --> 13:03.360]  to be deeper than that. But they have to do it in a way where it's not really completely
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.940]  frustrating to figure out how to get those things there. Yeah, of course, a lot of people
[13:07.940 --> 13:11.060]  and I would argue that a lot of people who own Android phones don't mind tinkering with
[13:11.060 --> 13:16.140]  that kind of stuff. But I would also say that, even then that that's overwhelming.
[13:16.140 --> 13:23.240]  Yeah. And it's, it is so true to that, you get a new app, and you launch it, and you're
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.120]  using this new thing, and it's going to be sending you notifications. And it just says,
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.520]  this app would like to send you notifications, allow or disallow. And then it's your one
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.000]  app, you say, Okay, yes, because I want to get these notifications. That's super easy.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.960]  It's easy to opt in. But then everything after that, in terms of fine tuning, you know, how
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.280]  much and what you get, it just always seems like busy work. Right. And and it what seems
[13:46.280 --> 13:51.640]  like a good idea when you first install the app. It just sometimes can be one of those,
[13:51.640 --> 13:54.960]  you know, frog in a slow boiling pot type thing where at first you don't really notice
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.140]  and then like a month or two and you're like, Why am I getting all these notifications from
[13:58.140 --> 14:04.760]  this app? This is this is overkill. My whole my whole lock screen is dominated by these
[14:04.760 --> 14:06.840]  stupid notifications from this one app.
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.800]  Yeah, I mean, I've gotten pretty good about on my iPhone customizing what hits the lock
[14:11.800 --> 14:20.520]  screen. But that was after quite a bit of tweaking and settings stuff. But I still you're
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.880]  right, I get like random alerts from apps I haven't, you know, I've once downloaded
[14:24.880 --> 14:31.880]  for testing or something. And it's like, you know, do this. Like brush my teeth. I reviewed
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.220]  that Bluetooth toothbrush a couple of months ago. And I actually have been still using
[14:36.220 --> 14:41.720]  the toothbrush. But I don't always use the app with it. Even though I said I was going
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.360]  to in my review, and I really do like brushing my teeth, my phone in my hand, but my phone
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.160]  keeps reminding me that I haven't brushed my teeth in like a month, which is like somewhat
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.280]  true. I mean, but as far as your phone, though, it's like, I don't think I told that app that
[14:55.280 --> 14:57.800]  you should be on my lock screen.
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.560]  I recommend you brush your teeth at least I would say at least once before the wedding.
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.960]  You should brush your teeth.
[15:03.960 --> 15:11.600]  I mean, at least once before the Apple event. Let's let's set priorities here.

[18:32.640 --> 18:39.200]  we're back. Um, one of your recent pieces, um, probably the most recent I think was your
[18:39.200 --> 18:47.480]  review of the, I'm going to get the name wrong. The HTC one something, something windows phone.
[18:47.480 --> 18:55.760]  You can do it. You can do it. It's the h t. So here it's the HTC one parentheses m eight
[18:55.760 --> 19:04.720]  close parentheses for windows. It's not with windows phone and it's not with windows phone
[19:04.720 --> 19:11.160]  eight point one. It is four windows, four windows, four windows. So yes, the review
[19:11.160 --> 19:15.200]  did not include a review of the phone name as somebody. I think Renee Ritchie tweeted
[19:15.200 --> 19:22.460]  that to me, but it should have the gist of it is it's pretty much the exact same hardware
[19:22.460 --> 19:28.880]  as the HTC one m eight that we know from android except it's running windows phone. It's got
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.480]  the same size, right? I'm looking at both of them right now. Right. And it has the same
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.560]  gimmicky one. I shouldn't say gimmicky. It has the same trick with the camera where there's
[19:38.560 --> 19:43.440]  two cameras, one that's like the really the, what do they call them? Ultra pixels, the
[19:43.440 --> 19:48.880]  one that takes the main picture and the second one that's used for some kind of trickery
[19:48.880 --> 19:56.000]  about changing the focal point focal distance after you've snapped the photo. Exactly, exactly.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  It's like the depth of, it collects depth information and then it sort of layers it
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.640]  and so you can refocus, which it doesn't really work all that well. But yes, exactly. Carbon
[20:06.640 --> 20:09.840]  copy of the android version just running different software.
[20:09.840 --> 20:17.020]  All right. I saw you had a little back and forth with Twitter on Twitter with somebody
[20:17.020 --> 20:24.960]  from from HTC about that. It was a great review, but the headline because the headline is what
[20:24.960 --> 20:29.600]  was the headline? Another line. Another great phone. You probably won't buy.
[20:29.600 --> 20:30.960]  Yep. Yep.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.800]  Which is interesting.
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.720]  Yeah, I mean, and that's not because of the hardware. I actually sat around a pretty much
[20:37.720 --> 20:43.200]  similar thing about the first HTC One, the M8 that came out in March because it was the
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.960]  same situation with the HTC One last year. The android version of the phone was really,
[20:47.960 --> 20:51.560]  really good, but nobody bought it because instead they listened to the marketing that
[20:51.560 --> 20:56.560]  they saw everywhere from Samsung and they bought Galaxy S5s or S4s or S3s, whatever
[20:56.560 --> 21:00.640]  was out at the time, instead of buying the HTC One. So I think, you know, HTC is sort
[21:00.640 --> 21:03.920]  of always seems to get caught in the middle of these things where it's like they make
[21:03.920 --> 21:09.200]  really good stuff, but nobody really buys them whether it's because of the marketing
[21:09.200 --> 21:12.840]  or whatever. But I think that's actually changed a lot with the recent phone. They had a lot
[21:12.840 --> 21:17.360]  more stock than they had with the original one. They did a better job of marketing it.
[21:17.360 --> 21:22.480]  The reviews are really good. But obviously, for this piece, that headline was really about
[21:22.480 --> 21:29.160]  Windows Phone because nobody has Windows Phone. And I'm really sorry to offend anyone who
[21:29.160 --> 21:33.360]  might be listening to this that has a Windows Phone. When I say nobody, I don't mean nobody
[21:33.360 --> 21:39.200]  in the world. I mean, really, the general public does not have Windows Phone. And for
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.800]  this piece, I don't even know how I sort of came up with the idea. But, you know, I
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.480]  went to Times Square and I wanted to do the video in Times Square. And then, you know,
[21:48.480 --> 21:52.760]  the column kind of turned into the same thing as the video because I sat in Times Square,
[21:52.760 --> 21:57.180]  we shot for about an hour, we took a break, we sat down, and I didn't see one single person
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.180]  with a Windows Phone.
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.840]  And you were stopping people.
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.920]  And I was stopping people. I mean, but I honestly couldn't stop that many people because most
[22:04.920 --> 22:08.840]  people have their phones out. So most people have iPhones or Android phones out because
[22:08.840 --> 22:13.520]  they're taking photos, they're taking selfies. I mean, it's like, you know, it's the best
[22:13.520 --> 22:18.040]  place on earth and also the worst place on earth. And so, you know, I really had to kind
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.640]  of find people that weren't holding their iPhones because I didn't want to be like,
[22:20.640 --> 22:23.740]  Oh, do you have a Windows Phone when clearly they have an iPhone or they clearly have a
[22:23.740 --> 22:28.680]  Galaxy S5 or actually did see a lot of HTC ones. I saw, you know, all types of phones,
[22:28.680 --> 22:29.840]  but no Windows Phones.
[22:29.840 --> 22:30.840]  Interesting.
[22:30.840 --> 22:37.080]  And so, you know, this piece was really about and I started using the one I have had the
[22:37.080 --> 22:43.400]  one for about a week. I also have had used the Lumia icon since 8.1 came out. And, you
[22:43.400 --> 22:47.720]  know, the software is really good. I really like the software. And at this point, there's
[22:47.720 --> 22:51.840]  a lot of features there that, you know, you certainly don't miss, you know, I didn't end
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.120]  up missing my iPhones, email apps or all these types of, you know, basic core apps. But,
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.920]  you know, so it makes you wonder why don't people have this? And of course, it comes
[22:59.920 --> 23:03.600]  down to the app ecosystem. But it's, you know, to me, I think it's a lot more than that.
[23:03.600 --> 23:05.000]  And I talk about that in the column.
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.220]  I do think it's very, it's complicated. And it's multifaceted. Like market share is not
[23:12.220 --> 23:18.920]  it alone. And the one thing, whenever I talk about market share, people accuse me, people
[23:18.920 --> 23:25.480]  who are not like big Apple fans accuse me of or and other people who tended to write
[23:25.480 --> 23:30.720]  about stuff from the Apple perspective of cherry picking the stat that app, you know,
[23:30.720 --> 23:36.040]  the only ones that matter are the ones where Apple's ahead. So when if iOS isn't leading
[23:36.040 --> 23:42.100]  in market share, then we'll pick profit share. And now profits is all that matters. And if
[23:42.100 --> 23:47.200]  it were the other way around, that if it was, you know, like when the the iPods had a market
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.080]  share lead, then market share mattered. And it's not like that the mistake that people
[23:51.080 --> 23:59.300]  make is is is if I say, market share is not everything. And it's not even the most single
[23:59.300 --> 24:03.360]  most important thing. That doesn't mean that I'm saying market share doesn't matter at
[24:03.360 --> 24:10.120]  all. It does matter, obviously. But it's not the only thing agreed. But the big thing I
[24:10.120 --> 24:15.960]  think the big thing is there's like a minimum viable market share. And, and, you know, if
[24:15.960 --> 24:21.520]  the overall smartphone market is eight right now, somewhere around like 80%, Android 12,
[24:21.520 --> 24:30.280]  this is worldwide 80%, Android 12%, iPhone and 2.5%, Windows Phone 12% isn't is big enough.
[24:30.280 --> 24:36.240]  And it's so many hundreds of millions of people. That's, it's a pretty big market and 2.5 may
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.640]  not just may not be enough. Yeah. And I think, you know, what, right, you're right, this
[24:40.640 --> 24:45.200]  is the global market share. So when you you also have to factor in, and this was something
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.280]  we're talking about earlier today with with some people in the office, factoring in the
[24:49.280 --> 24:56.220]  lower end of the market, and lower cost areas where you look at, you know, the you're not
[24:56.220 --> 25:00.480]  looking at the top end of the market, and you're not looking at sort of these halo flagship
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.120]  devices. And that's where obviously, Android has captured a large part of the market. And
[25:06.120 --> 25:12.520]  that's a place that Microsoft has also said they've intended to go. And so that that's
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.280]  certainly a different look at market share than when you look at either, you know, us
[25:16.280 --> 25:22.000]  or you look at sort of country by country. Yeah. I do think there's also I've thought
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.240]  about this so much over the years, because I feel like every market ends up playing out
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.840]  differently, right? There's some similarities between this and the PC wars of the 90s, between
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.860]  Mac and Windows and similarities, but there's so many other factors are different that it's
[25:36.860 --> 25:44.880]  there's only loose similarities and everything, every market plays out differently. But the
[25:44.880 --> 25:50.860]  one thing that I do think holds true in just about every category through the decades,
[25:50.860 --> 25:56.160]  is that you somehow have to get early adopters usually have to get early adopters first,
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.920]  you've got to get some enthusiasts on board nerds, right, the people who listen to stuff
[26:00.920 --> 26:07.000]  like this show and and who, who like to geek out and and review 29 laptops or something
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.360]  like that. You have to get them first. And that's the one you know, and iOS clearly has
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.720]  that and had it right from day one when people you know, those are the people who lined up
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.000]  around the block in 2007 to buy it. Android definitely has that, you know, there's, you
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.080]  know, and that's the whole, you know, Coke versus Pepsi flame wars that you see in the
[26:26.080 --> 26:32.400]  comments on on general purpose tech review site. I think that's step one of the windows
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.120]  from problem is that there aren't any of them. Right. And and I think
[26:37.120 --> 26:44.400]  they're, they are there. I just think they, I think it's still a timing thing. Like they
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.560]  might have come along too late. Yeah. Right. Because they are they those people are there.
[26:49.560 --> 26:51.520]  I've heard from them today.
[26:51.520 --> 26:58.640]  Well, and again, when we say nobody, we don't really mean 0.0. Right, right, right. Practically
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.880]  nobody like, effectively, you can round down to zero.
[27:01.880 --> 27:09.840]  Yeah, you're right. You're right. I just, I come back to a lot of it being timing. And
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.760]  I think, you know, and Microsoft admits that it was timing, right. You know, they'll say,
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.200]  well, we actually were we were had Windows Phone, the idea, but then, you know, Android
[27:20.200 --> 27:26.780]  came out and stole a lot of the market and partners and etc. And I think, you know, part
[27:26.780 --> 27:31.400]  of that is that, by now, when we're looking at this five years or six years deep into
[27:31.400 --> 27:38.520]  the smartphone market, now, finally, Microsoft is good enough on a platform level to be in
[27:38.520 --> 27:44.660]  line with the competition. And at this point, what does that matter? Right? It's not necessarily
[27:44.660 --> 27:50.680]  pushing ahead the smartphone in some radical way that I'm going to say to someone, no,
[27:50.680 --> 27:56.220]  you've got to get this phone. Right. And, you know, frankly, like, you know, even I
[27:56.220 --> 27:59.560]  think we're starting to see with iOS and Android, as we see these updates coming in the next
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.760]  couple months, like, there's so much feature parity, right? There's so many things that
[28:03.760 --> 28:07.760]  you can get now in one or the other, whether it's different keyboards, or it's different
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.480]  notification customization, and all of these sorts of things that, you know, people will
[28:12.480 --> 28:17.000]  argue, holy, I wonder where they got that idea from, you know, we're getting to that
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.980]  point where it's so it is so reliant on the apps that we have, but there's still nothing
[28:22.980 --> 28:27.440]  that has pushed smartphones so far ahead into the future. And I'm not even sure I can't
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.320]  even imagine, like, I don't look at my phone and say, I mean, I look at my phone and say,
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.380]  these are the things I would want, but they're not necessarily radical ideas. Yeah, it's
[28:35.380 --> 28:41.000]  just refinement, refinement, refinement, you know, right. It's like refinement and, and
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.080]  there are basic things, but I don't think even for basic things, I would, I would switch
[28:46.080 --> 28:51.860]  to a different platform if it didn't offer everything and more. Yeah. Yeah, somebody
[28:51.860 --> 28:59.240]  else pointed that out, like post Google IO, because Google IO was after WWDC this year,
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.480]  but you look at the checklist, and there's, you know, there's 10 or 15 things that you
[29:03.480 --> 29:10.660]  could see starting around 2011 or so that these platforms needed to do to get to do
[29:10.660 --> 29:17.220]  more of the stuff that it was, everybody wanted, you know, better notifications. And on iOS,
[29:17.220 --> 29:21.880]  people wanted a, you know, third party keyboards and stuff like that. And you could just see
[29:21.880 --> 29:27.000]  that the two companies, you know, Google and Apple, they just had a different order, different
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.520]  priorities of which ones they were going to do first. And eventually, they just, you know,
[29:31.520 --> 29:36.000]  they both checked off all of them. And some of them, you know, were first on Android,
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.240]  and some were first on iOS. And we're getting to the point this year where they've sort
[29:40.240 --> 29:44.440]  of gotten to the bottom of that list, not that that there's nowhere for these things
[29:44.440 --> 29:49.800]  to improve. But all the big obvious ones from about four or five years ago, they've gotten
[29:49.800 --> 29:50.800]  to.
[29:50.800 --> 29:54.400]  Right, right. And that, you know, that's one of the lines that in this in this piece was
[29:54.400 --> 29:59.080]  like, you know, switching to Windows Phone at this point is like just getting a comfortable
[29:59.080 --> 30:03.180]  home, your same comfortable home in a one that right across the street, that's basically
[30:03.180 --> 30:07.360]  the same thing. There's no real reason to switch at this point. Plus, you're not getting
[30:07.360 --> 30:12.440]  all those extras, if those are important to you, if those brand new apps, if those updates
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.720]  to your apps are extremely important to you, there's, there's no real reason to leave where
[30:16.720 --> 30:17.920]  you've been so comfortable.
[30:17.920 --> 30:21.840]  Yeah. And I think if you're an enthusiast, and you're kind of, you know, the sort of
[30:21.840 --> 30:25.480]  person who likes to get new apps and stuff, you know, follows new, new, new companies
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.760]  and stuff like that. Windows Phone has all that stuff, you know, like you pointed out
[30:30.760 --> 30:35.480]  Instagram, which is a great example where where Instagram was iOS only famously for
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.040]  first couple of years, and then and then the Android version came out. And, you know, it
[30:40.040 --> 30:44.440]  was huge. And then it, you know, fueled the billion dollar acquisition by Facebook. And
[30:44.440 --> 30:49.600]  eventually there now there is a Windows Phone version of it, but it was way after the even
[30:49.600 --> 30:56.240]  the Android version. And even now, it still lags because they've added these new the latest
[30:56.240 --> 31:00.520]  version of Instagram has a bunch of new editing features that aren't in the Windows Phone
[31:00.520 --> 31:01.520]  version.
[31:01.520 --> 31:07.040]  Right. Right. And that's you see that across apps, like my audio app, I spent like 10 minutes
[31:07.040 --> 31:12.200]  in the car trying to find my top where I usually go to find, you know, pop music. And I could
[31:12.200 --> 31:16.560]  not find the playlist in the Windows Phone app. And I'm pretty sure it's not there, but
[31:16.560 --> 31:17.560]  I gave up.
[31:17.560 --> 31:21.880]  And I think you said that there's there's still not a Lyft app. Yeah, Windows Phone.
[31:21.880 --> 31:27.880]  Yeah, all of those. And I know what do you call it was was late on Windows Phone, Uber,
[31:27.880 --> 31:32.680]  you know, was and if you're the sort of person who wants to use stuff like that, like you've
[31:32.680 --> 31:37.440]  heard about Uber, you're traveling, you know, you're in San Francisco, on vacation or business
[31:37.440 --> 31:42.760]  or something like that. And everybody else is using Uber. And you can't because you're
[31:42.760 --> 31:48.720]  using Windows Phone. It's like, right. It's just a steady drip drop of annoyances of knowing
[31:48.720 --> 31:53.160]  that you're always going to be the last to get stuff like this. And, you know, circa
[31:53.160 --> 31:59.200]  what is announced later, we get second half of 2014. By 2015, I'm sure there will be a
[31:59.200 --> 32:03.560]  Lyft app, but then there's going to be something else that's new. That's only on iOS. It's
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.560]  only on Android,
[32:04.560 --> 32:09.640]  totally. And that's the number one reservation I have about the platform. But you know, the
[32:09.640 --> 32:12.680]  funny thing is that I think maybe two years ago, we would have said, Well, this is an
[32:12.680 --> 32:18.920]  okay platform. This is an okay phone. Regardless, for people who have not had a smartphone yet,
[32:18.920 --> 32:22.920]  it's a good beginner phone. But I think we're at this point, we're in the market where
[32:22.920 --> 32:27.000]  already, those people have a phone, and they probably have an iPhone, or they probably
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.200]  have a basic Android phone. And at those this point, those people don't want to switch.
[32:32.200 --> 32:37.740]  So that's where I think so much of this was a timing game. And, you know, it's unfortunate
[32:37.740 --> 32:40.480]  for Microsoft. I mean, I'm not going to sit here crying for them. But it's unfortunate
[32:40.480 --> 32:45.720]  that they got to get got together a really good operating system so late in the game,
[32:45.720 --> 32:48.360]  because there are a lot of things here that I actually really like now. And yes, some
[32:48.360 --> 32:52.360]  of them are, you know, the same as you'd get on others. But, you know, Cortana is a really
[32:52.360 --> 32:57.120]  nice blend of Siri and Google. Now, I like a lot of I like a lot of features that they
[32:57.120 --> 33:01.240]  built into Cortana. I like a lot of things that when it comes to the customizations and
[33:01.240 --> 33:05.940]  the notifications and all the base, you know, base OS stuff, it's just, you know, how much
[33:05.940 --> 33:07.600]  time are you usually spending in that stuff?
[33:07.600 --> 33:12.480]  Now, the thing I noticed when I last spent some time with Windows phones was when I was
[33:12.480 --> 33:20.600]  at the build conference back in May is, and Windows Phone was always better to me than
[33:20.600 --> 33:24.760]  Android in this regard, but the latest I don't think we had eight one yet, maybe I forget
[33:24.760 --> 33:28.300]  the version number, but we were playing with phones that had an as yet unreleased version
[33:28.300 --> 33:34.320]  of it. So maybe it was like an early version of eight one. But the little animations like
[33:34.320 --> 33:38.560]  stretching when you get to the bottom of the list, and the bouncing and stuff like that
[33:38.560 --> 33:44.560]  is so much nicer than stock Android. It's it's really good. And the frame rates, I mean,
[33:44.560 --> 33:49.640]  just frame rates across the board. It's really, really snappy UI. And it's something that
[33:49.640 --> 33:53.360]  Microsoft has been good at for for a long time. But it really shows.
[33:53.360 --> 33:56.560]  Yeah, yeah. And I like the keyboard too. I mean,
[33:56.560 --> 34:00.440]  yeah, I will say that one thing whenever I try switching to an Android phone, and this
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.720]  isn't better or worse, is it just habit, but I find myself really struggling to type because
[34:05.720 --> 34:10.960]  I find the Android keyboard, at least the default one to be so different. Whereas Windows
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.280]  Phone it, my iOS typing habits, I just instantly was typing as well as I do on an iPhone.
[34:17.280 --> 34:21.800]  It's funny, you know, I we I think we talked about this the last time I was on my keyboard
[34:21.800 --> 34:28.920]  situation. I have I have I've serious keyboard problems. And I made the switch to the iPhone
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.780]  keyboard after using Android physical QWERTY keyboard on the Android phone for four, three
[34:33.780 --> 34:40.040]  or four years. And now I'm great on the iPhone. And now when I go back to my Moto X Android
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.920]  phone, I'm really bad. So I've been using Swift key, which is better. I'm actually really
[34:43.920 --> 34:51.600]  excited. I'm hoping Swift key builds a app for iOS eight. But I still I still don't think
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.920]  I found the perfect software keyboard. That said, I'm just gonna go get that new Blackberry
[34:56.920 --> 35:02.480]  that's in the shape of a square. And I think that'll solve all my problems.
[35:02.480 --> 35:04.880]  Let's hold off on Thank God that's not being released during
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.040]  my wedding weekend. Thank God. Let me take a few moments here and tell everybody
[35:09.040 --> 35:15.940]  about our good friends at Warby Parker. Warby Parker provides boutique quality, classically
[35:15.940 --> 35:22.100]  crafted eyewear revolutionary price points. The company was conceived as an alternative
[35:22.100 --> 35:27.400]  to the overpriced eyewear that's available today. Prescription eyewear simply should
[35:27.400 --> 35:34.940]  not cost three, four or $500. And the whole company was founded on the idea. Why Why Why
[35:34.940 --> 35:38.540]  do glasses cost so much? Do they have to? And the answer is no, it ends up that the
[35:38.540 --> 35:42.940]  industry is mostly is controlled largely by a few large companies that have kept prices
[35:42.940 --> 35:50.160]  artificially high reaping huge profits from customers who have no other options. So Warby
[35:50.160 --> 35:55.780]  Parker came into this market a few years ago and and they've turned it upside down. Really
[35:55.780 --> 36:01.680]  popular more popular than ever before. What are the what are the main points? Here's the
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.580]  thing. Number one, eyeglasses should not cost as much as an iPhone. Their prescription glasses
[36:06.580 --> 36:13.400]  start at just 95 bucks, including prescription lenses. They have a titanium collection with
[36:13.400 --> 36:19.960]  metal frames that starts at 145 bucks. Also with the prescription lens. They use premium
[36:19.960 --> 36:27.840]  Japanese titanium, French non rocking screws. All glasses include anti reflective and anti
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.160]  glare coating. There's no additional cost because who doesn't want that everybody wants
[36:31.160 --> 36:36.600]  that of course you want that. All glasses include a hard case and a cleaning cloth really
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.720]  nice case got a couple of them here in the house. Really, really nice case case to all
[36:41.720 --> 36:48.480]  high quality. The price is way lower, but you get a really, really quality set of eyeglasses.
[36:48.480 --> 36:53.800]  And they make buying glasses online easy and risk free. They have a home try on program.
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.520]  So you go online, you look at their website, find the frames you're interested in. They
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.360]  have some cool features on the website, you can use a webcam, get your picture up there.
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.680]  Just get a basic idea of what the frames look like on your face. But then you pick five
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.160]  pairs and they just ship them to you. Now they don't have your prescription lenses in
[37:09.160 --> 37:12.480]  them yet. It's like trying them on in the store, but they've sent five to you. You can
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.080]  try them on at home, get get your feedback from your friends and family. See what people
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.320]  like. And you can keep them for five days before you send them back, get you know, sleep
[37:22.320 --> 37:25.920]  on it. Look at them for a couple days. Then you send them back, you tell them which one
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.480]  you want, if any. And when you place your order for prescription glasses, they'll get
[37:32.480 --> 37:38.120]  started on them right away and you'll have them in your hands within 10 business days.
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.800]  In my experience, our experience here, usually less.
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.740]  So here's another great feature about Warby. Gotta mention it. For every pair of glasses
[37:47.740 --> 37:54.240]  they sell, they distribute another pair of prescription glasses to someone in need around
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.840]  the world. For a lot of people around the world, access to prescription glasses is just
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.380]  out of reach. And Warby Parker is doing great work on a one for one basis with the glasses
[38:04.380 --> 38:12.900]  they sell to, uh, to help turn that around. So where do you go to find out more? You need
[38:12.900 --> 38:21.920]  eyeglasses. Here's what you do. Go to warby parker.com slash the talk show warby parker.com
[38:21.920 --> 38:30.640]  slash the talk show and you'll get your five try on frames and by using that URL slash
[38:30.640 --> 38:36.840]  the talk show, you get free three day shipping on your order. Send the frames back, choose
[38:36.840 --> 38:43.360]  your favorite pairs. Warby makes it completely risk free with that free shipping three days.
[38:43.360 --> 38:47.680]  So my thanks to Warby Parker and go check them out if you need new classes. What's this
[38:47.680 --> 38:52.000]  that I did? I was kind of hoping that would be out by now that we were talking about the
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.600]  square blackberry. I know. Where is it? As soon as I saw it, I, as soon as I saw it,
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.080]  my first thought was that's interesting. And my second thought was, Ooh, I can't wait to
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.840]  talk to Joanna about that. But you think maybe, maybe you're over physical keyboards now.
[39:07.840 --> 39:13.400]  Maybe your habits have finally switched. I mean they had, they had to, right? We have
[39:13.400 --> 39:19.380]  to adapt. So I had to adapt and I'm really fast on my iPhone now. I'm actually really
[39:19.380 --> 39:25.560]  fast on SwiftKey too. If the phone can not be so slow, my, the, my Moto X is really slow
[39:25.560 --> 39:32.080]  now. Um, but I'm really fast on my iPhone and I'm excited about the iPhone's predictive
[39:32.080 --> 39:38.220]  tech stuff with iOS eight as well. So, I mean, I can't say that I haven't done a typing test,
[39:38.220 --> 39:46.600]  me versus myself on the iPhone versus an old blackberry, but that's a good idea. Yeah,
[39:46.600 --> 39:53.160]  but I, I, there's certain parts of user interface design where it's almost more important or
[39:53.160 --> 39:57.440]  not even almost, but it is more important how fast you think you are versus how fast
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.240]  you really are. And if you feel like you're fast enough on the iPhone, that's really all
[40:01.240 --> 40:06.100]  that matters. Even if you found out that like on a stopwatch, you're still not as fast as
[40:06.100 --> 40:12.120]  you were on blackberry. Right. So a famous example of this is, uh, I might botch some
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.640]  of the details, but this is like a really old Apple story, like from the eighties. Um,
[40:17.640 --> 40:22.880]  and I think I got the story from Bruce Tog. Well, I'll just call him Tog. Everybody knows
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.760]  Tog, but it human interface design guru used to be at Apple and now he's at the Neiman
[40:28.760 --> 40:37.720]  whatever group. Um, and Apple used to use to test an awful lot of stuff in, um, with
[40:37.720 --> 40:44.540]  cameras in a behind glass and just test real people doing stuff. And what they found out
[40:44.540 --> 40:49.760]  is that people were way faster. Like let's say they wanted to print, they'd say, here,
[40:49.760 --> 40:55.160]  make a new document in Mac, right? And then go and print it. And when they would tell
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.120]  some of the people to use the mouse and go up to file, pull it down, go down to print
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.360]  and tell other people to use the keyboard shortcuts. Uh, and they found that the mouse
[41:05.360 --> 41:12.420]  was using the mouse to go up to file print was faster than using the command P to print
[41:12.420 --> 41:19.640]  or file save and with the mouse was faster than command S. Um, but then when they asked
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.640]  the users, which was faster, that was like almost unanimous that they said using a keyboard
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.640]  shortcut was faster because when they first had the research that said, Hey, it's always
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.360]  faster to use the menu. They thought about getting rid of all the, the keyboard shortcuts
[41:33.360 --> 41:36.640]  and saying, forget all these keyboard shortcuts. We'll just make the user use the mouse all
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.540]  the time because it's faster, but it felt slower and the best that they could figure
[41:41.540 --> 41:46.740]  it out is that when you, when you use a keyboard shortcut, it's like two parts of your brain
[41:46.740 --> 41:52.740]  at once. There's the first part where you have to remember the, um, what it is like,
[41:52.740 --> 41:57.020]  you know, you want to save this document and then your brain pauses and goes, all right,
[41:57.020 --> 42:02.120]  it's a command S. You use your, use your left thumb, put it on the command key and then
[42:02.120 --> 42:07.360]  you hit the S and then you do it isn't true now though. Well, I, it might be different
[42:07.360 --> 42:11.580]  now because people are so used to computers. Who knows? But the point is though that it
[42:11.580 --> 42:17.960]  ends up that people don't remember the time they spend remembering the keystroke. It's
[42:17.960 --> 42:22.440]  like that didn't happen. And so the only part that they feel like they remember is the actual
[42:22.440 --> 42:27.080]  using their fingers. There's like a blank spot there where you don't remember it. I
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.340]  think, I think it might be for a lot of people, maybe for power users, it's not true. It's
[42:31.340 --> 42:37.040]  definitely not the case for me. I mean, right. But I think for typical people it might be,
[42:37.040 --> 42:44.880]  but they still feel better. That's the difference between learned, yeah, learned and whatever.
[42:44.880 --> 42:51.560]  What's the, uh, a learned action and what becomes habit. Yeah, that's not the right
[42:51.560 --> 42:56.080]  word, but yeah, but like command, command S is maybe a bad example because for a lot
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.760]  of us, we don't even think about it. Like, like my friend Michael Lop, the render and
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.160]  post guy, he, when he's writing, he just, he writes a sentence and then when he's thinking
[43:04.160 --> 43:08.920]  about what to write next, his fingers just do command S because like, you know, in the
[43:08.920 --> 43:13.180]  old days when computer crashes would just bring down your whole computer, you know,
[43:13.180 --> 43:18.240]  you were always one, one crash away from losing what you've written. So there's an, I have
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.320]  that habit. I still have that habit, but now that I've worked so much in Google docs, I
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.320]  guess I've kind of killed that habit. Uh, it's to me, it's an important thing. Like
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.760]  as on a Mac, any Mac app, even if it's not like a file based app, if it's like some kind
[43:30.760 --> 43:36.960]  of thing where you just, it's like a library, you know, type thing you should at least,
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.880]  even if command S doesn't do anything, don't beep or anything like that when you hit command
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.960]  S, even if it isn't necessary, if everything you type gets saved automatically, let me
[43:45.960 --> 43:51.400]  hit command S anyway, cause I feel better. Interesting. But that's, I don't think I even
[43:51.400 --> 43:56.000]  do it when I'm going to go into Google docs now. I have a horrible command, but Michael
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.880]  Lops is like pathological. Michael up does command S probably like a 30 times a minute.
[44:01.880 --> 44:10.480]  He just type, type, type command us type, type, type command us. Yeah. I mean, I'm going
[44:10.480 --> 44:13.400]  to have to do a typing test. I'm gonna have to do a typing test when this, when this new
[44:13.400 --> 44:18.480]  Blackberry comes out though, who knows when that's happening? I do think it's a shame.
[44:18.480 --> 44:22.000]  This is another one of those things where it's like maybe too late, but it's like, man,
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.600]  if only Blackberry had come out with a phone in that form factor a couple of years ago,
[44:27.600 --> 44:33.280]  doesn't it? Software that was decent. Yeah. I mean, that's the big if, but boy, form factor
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.160]  wise, it really looks to me like, Hey, here's somebody who's not just trying to copy the
[44:38.160 --> 44:44.360]  2007 iPhone. Right. But what, I mean, I, and I know they've made some arguments that the
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.000]  square shape and their aspect ratio of the screen is better for like, I think it's Excel
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.320]  documents like really like, yeah, like really that's where you're, I mean, it's, it's right
[44:54.320 --> 45:00.080]  on marketing message for them, I guess. It's better for Instagram. Right. That's a good
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.960]  point. It's a, it's a, it's exact square shape for an Instagram. Yeah. I'm sure the camera's
[45:05.960 --> 45:11.040]  going to suck. Yeah, probably. Well, maybe it won't. I do feel like that's part of, part
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.360]  of the irony of Instagram lagging on windows phone is that windows phone as a platform
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.040]  is known for having good cameras. Great cameras. Yeah. Like just platform wide. I mean, that's
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.280]  actually one of the things that's hard about this HTC is that you can get way better cameras
[45:26.280 --> 45:31.880]  on the Lumias, but I prefer the design of this HTC to the Lumia, you know, the Lumia
[45:31.880 --> 45:37.760]  design. Yeah. Yeah. HTC is interesting. You know, I know we're a little all over the map
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.880]  here, but HTC is an interesting company because I've said this for years and it sort of is,
[45:42.880 --> 45:49.100]  it just goes to show how, how again, you can, I say design is very important, but it's not,
[45:49.100 --> 45:52.980]  it doesn't mean everything right. And there's, HTC is a great example of a company who I
[45:52.980 --> 45:58.800]  think has every year, year after year has produced better designed phones than Samsung
[45:58.800 --> 46:04.120]  and just gotten, just gotten annihilated in the market from the start, from, from the
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.120]  start of even, even if you think about when those, both of those companies were making
[46:08.120 --> 46:15.520]  the original windows phones, you know, when you think about, what was it? Was it the,
[46:15.520 --> 46:22.840]  what was that HTC with the slider? That was a really good phone. The diamond. No, it wasn't
[46:22.840 --> 46:30.280]  a diamond. It was in that same family. Well, the thing I remember, and this, this goes
[46:30.280 --> 46:38.160]  back to that, that the, the sort of transition years when the iPhone had the modern smartphone
[46:38.160 --> 46:43.280]  market to itself because Android wasn't out yet and Microsoft was still on windows mobile,
[46:43.280 --> 46:54.140]  you know, 2007, 2008, 2009. HTC tilt. Yeah. HTC tilt. HTC back then was a good phone.
[46:54.140 --> 47:00.520]  They were by far and away the number one windows mobile hands maker. That's what I was talking
[47:00.520 --> 47:04.440]  about. I didn't mean windows, windows mobile, right? But they were to windows mobile. What
[47:04.440 --> 47:09.400]  like Samsung is to, to Android. Absolutely. Cause they made these types of phones. They
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.280]  made the good keyboard. They had a stylist that came out. The what was the other one
[47:15.280 --> 47:24.760]  after the tilt? I'm losing my, my memory was the, the arrive was the windows phone, whatever.
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.240]  They made great keyboards on these. I think this is basically what I'm getting at here
[47:30.240 --> 47:40.080]  is that I really want HTC to make an old slide out keyboard phone with windows phone with
[47:40.080 --> 47:46.680]  apps that I want to use. And I'll be happy. I do think there's, and you know, they've
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.520]  used better materials than Samsung. I mean, it's just, you know, the, the, there's to
[47:51.520 --> 47:57.680]  some degree, I mean, it's not the most important thing. I mean, it's, it's, it's not logical,
[47:57.680 --> 48:01.720]  I guess, to say how good does the phone look when it's not even on before you even know
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.440]  which operating system it is. But for something you carry about with you all day and that
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.560]  you do hold in your hand all the time, it matters. I think, you know, does it feel good
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.160]  in your hand? And HTC's phones feel way better than Samsung's. Oh yeah. Samsung's are, I
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.640]  mean, I know now last week they announced this one that has a little bit of metal on
[48:18.640 --> 48:24.600]  it. Yeah. Just the frame, just the, it's almost like they're, they're like four years behind.
[48:24.600 --> 48:29.440]  They're sort of like the iPhone four S and four, you know, with the metal outside, but
[48:29.440 --> 48:37.240]  the back is still plastic. Yeah. I mean, it's Samsung phones feel like even the reviews
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.200]  I, cause I read all the, you know, the, the reviews of these things. I don't necessarily
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.360]  link to all of them, but uh, even from people who are big fans and you know, like a really
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.840]  glowing review of like a new galaxy phone, it inevitably mentioned, you know, kind of
[48:50.840 --> 48:57.040]  a cheap build quality feel to it. I, I, I don't, I haven't really read glowing reviews
[48:57.040 --> 49:04.880]  of the Samsung phone. Not recently, not recently, but I mean it is, it, it was baffling to me
[49:04.880 --> 49:12.960]  how many more people, I mean even appreciated the galaxy S fours design over the HTC one
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.820]  about two years ago that people even, even when all things that other things were equal,
[49:18.820 --> 49:24.460]  were recommending the Samsung over the HTC. Um, and, and part of that was marketing. Part
[49:24.460 --> 49:27.400]  of that might've been some of these software features that no one ever figured out how
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.680]  to use and now they're not even in the phone. Um, but yeah, I mean Samsung's biggest problem
[49:32.680 --> 49:39.300]  to me at this point isn't hardware design. It is a hundred percent software design. Um,
[49:39.300 --> 49:44.920]  that galaxy tab S is a really nice piece of hardware. If you can look aside the plastic
[49:44.920 --> 49:52.600]  backing, the software is just a nightmare. That's the one that has two sizes. Yeah, two
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.400]  sides. It's exactly going head to head with the iPad mini retina and with the, with the
[49:57.400 --> 50:02.400]  air. All right. But they still still have that build quality stuff. Remember the one
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.580]  and it's really, it's thin. I mean it, you know, when you look at, when you look at how
[50:06.580 --> 50:10.460]  thin it is and you think, okay, well they had to do maybe some of this plastic tooling
[50:10.460 --> 50:15.580]  on the back and to make it a little bit lighter. That doesn't bother me as much as, as, as
[50:15.580 --> 50:21.360]  the software. I think part of it too, I do think part of it is a, it's an institutional
[50:21.360 --> 50:25.880]  lack of taste because even like materials aside, even if you say cost wise, we've got
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.420]  to build this out of plastic. Um, they've done things where they've made the back look
[50:30.420 --> 50:35.900]  like fake leather and they even have like fake stitching and it's just tacky. So tacky.
[50:35.900 --> 50:40.100]  But I think another thing, we're not going to discuss the bandaid back either. We're
[50:40.100 --> 50:46.720]  not going there. I think another factor though is that they put out so many things a year,
[50:46.720 --> 50:51.340]  you know, that they don't just concentrate on one or two flagship new devices that I
[50:51.340 --> 50:55.180]  forget how many tablets Samsung has put out in the last calendar year. Somebody, when
[50:55.180 --> 51:00.320]  they came out with the tab, ask, tallied them all up and it's, I did. Yeah. I don't remember.
[51:00.320 --> 51:05.420]  I think it was like nine, nine or 10 actually said to my editor this morning, uh, Wilson
[51:05.420 --> 51:10.900]  in case he ever hears this. Um, I said, Oh, well there's this Barnes and Noble event tomorrow
[51:10.900 --> 51:16.140]  and they're releasing the tab. You know, according to the rumors, it seems like they're releasing
[51:16.140 --> 51:21.140]  the tab for with, you know, some Barnes and Noble software. And he's like, wait, the tab
[51:21.140 --> 51:25.460]  for, didn't we just review that? And I was like, no, we, we reviewed the tab s is like,
[51:25.460 --> 51:30.940]  Oh right. There's a difference. I think that when you, when they put out that many devices
[51:30.940 --> 51:34.900]  here to, you know, if they put out 10 tablets a year, I don't know that they can ever put
[51:34.900 --> 51:40.700]  enough time into getting any one of them up, up to the standards that the people who've
[51:40.700 --> 51:46.900]  seen like HTC devices and Apple devices and even Nokia devices expect because it's, it's
[51:46.900 --> 51:51.980]  too scattered. Right? Well, that was the argument they made with this tab s they said, you know,
[51:51.980 --> 51:57.160]  this is, this is the flagship tablet, like just like the flagship phone with the galaxy
[51:57.160 --> 52:00.900]  s five or whatever, you know, the four or whatever that they do every year. This is
[52:00.900 --> 52:07.020]  the flagship tablet. You know, for these flagship phones, pay a little bit more attention to
[52:07.020 --> 52:11.060]  that. I mean, I imagine somewhere deep there, they are really working on these software
[52:11.060 --> 52:15.580]  issues because the reviews are all bashing them for it.
[52:15.580 --> 52:22.660]  Yeah, but it's hard though, because that's, you can say we have to get better at software,
[52:22.660 --> 52:28.540]  but doing it is a different thing. And it's, you know, they've never really shown an aptitude
[52:28.540 --> 52:34.860]  for it. Right. And it makes me wonder whether they might not, you know, I don't know that
[52:34.860 --> 52:37.860]  that's what they're thinking. But I would, I would wonder whether they're looking at,
[52:37.860 --> 52:43.860]  you know, some kind of big acquisition to get to bring in software talent that could,
[52:43.860 --> 52:49.260]  you know, just hire, it's figure out somebody, some company that does mobile software well
[52:49.260 --> 52:53.460]  enough. And at that sort of scale that they could, you know, have enough people to do
[52:53.460 --> 52:57.900]  it and, and bring in a new team, because I don't think the people who are already there
[52:57.900 --> 53:02.340]  have any, you know, have shown anything that that they're even on a path to getting where
[53:02.340 --> 53:03.340]  they need to be.
[53:03.340 --> 53:08.460]  Right. Or, you know, with the improved relations with Google and Google, what what they seem
[53:08.460 --> 53:12.140]  to be doing is really cleaning everything up. And I was actually going to write a piece
[53:12.140 --> 53:18.260]  on this a couple of months ago when the LG G3 came out. That phone is really clean now,
[53:18.260 --> 53:23.960]  you know, LG cleaned up their act there and didn't throw on all these types of widgets
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.380]  and these little buzzing things they used to have on their phones. They really did a
[53:28.380 --> 53:32.460]  nice job sort of cleaning the interface up. I mean, there's still some of it and you got
[53:32.460 --> 53:36.700]  to go through and delete it all. But for the most part, they've done a good job. And you
[53:36.700 --> 53:41.260]  know, when you look at some of the other stuff that's been coming out, I mean, the L version
[53:41.260 --> 53:46.080]  of Android, a lot of this stuff is looking really clean and polished. You know, there's
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.580]  no reason Samsung couldn't just stick with that. Of course, they want to put their mark
[53:50.580 --> 53:53.780]  on it. But yeah, see, the problem then is that they're not differentiated. There's
[53:53.780 --> 53:57.740]  nothing you know, but maybe they work closer with Google to figure out what that is for
[53:57.740 --> 54:03.360]  them instead of just making these things ugly, right somehow get most somehow work out a
[54:03.360 --> 54:07.820]  thing with Google to get most favored handset maker status and I don't know, get a new version
[54:07.820 --> 54:13.300]  of Android first or something. But right. And maybe maybe this stuff just bothers us.
[54:13.300 --> 54:17.860]  I have I see a lot of people and I have friends with the with with Galaxy phones and they
[54:17.860 --> 54:22.620]  still have the crap just sitting there. They just have those those s widgets and s health
[54:22.620 --> 54:27.140]  widgets just sitting there on the home screen. It's like, you guys know you can move that
[54:27.140 --> 54:31.100]  right? It doesn't bother you is like looking at like a really ugly painting on your phone
[54:31.100 --> 54:33.460]  or your wall every day.
[54:33.460 --> 54:39.260]  It but it baffles me to no end. But it's true that I think probably most people don't even
[54:39.260 --> 54:42.860]  think about stuff like that. They don't see it. And if it registers at any level, it doesn't
[54:42.860 --> 54:46.860]  register at the level where they want to figure out if they can do something. But the problem
[54:46.860 --> 54:50.860]  is is those aren't good customers, because if they don't even care that you gave them
[54:50.860 --> 54:56.620]  crap where on your this, you know, this year's LG, whatever, to two years ago, two years
[54:56.620 --> 54:59.940]  from now, or three years from now, when they get a new phone, they're not gonna have any
[54:59.940 --> 55:03.620]  kind of loyalty to that device, they're not going to come in and say, I want the new LG
[55:03.620 --> 55:07.900]  thing, they're just gonna say whatever, you know, if they if they said whatever, when
[55:07.900 --> 55:11.340]  you showed them this phone that has all this crap, they're going to go into the Verizon
[55:11.340 --> 55:16.260]  store and say, just give me whatever three years from now. And it's not a LG, if it's
[55:16.260 --> 55:21.500]  a Samsung now, or if it's an HTC, that that's why they're, they're all trying to differentiate
[55:21.500 --> 55:22.500]  on software.
[55:22.500 --> 55:25.760]  And, and when you the irony here is, when you think about it, when you take a Windows
[55:25.760 --> 55:28.980]  Phone out of the box, you don't you don't get a cleaner experience. I mean, you do you
[55:28.980 --> 55:35.280]  get iOS has a similar clean experience. But like, this is a really polished experience,
[55:35.280 --> 55:40.220]  there's not a lot of crap anywhere, even if there is sort of hidden below the, you know,
[55:40.220 --> 55:45.220]  main main center tiles, it's a really clean experience that and I think an easier one
[55:45.220 --> 55:48.440]  for people out of the box. And I said that in the review this week is that, you know,
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.220]  I would rather teach someone how to use a Windows Phone than an Android phone.
[55:52.220 --> 55:58.040]  Yeah. Yeah, I would have everything I've seen. Yeah, definitely. It's a lot it doesn't go
[55:58.040 --> 56:04.280]  it doesn't seem like stuff is as nested. Right. Right. It's a lot flatter conceptually, not
[56:04.280 --> 56:10.020]  flat and visual, you know, you know, iOS and all the not the flat UI design, but flat in
[56:10.020 --> 56:14.580]  terms of if you're just going to map it out on a whiteboard, here's the
[56:14.580 --> 56:15.580]  how to find things.
[56:15.580 --> 56:22.280]  Yeah, here's how to find things. Yeah, it's a lot simpler. Our next sponsor is another
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.300]  longtime supporter of the show, our good friends at Backblaze. Now you guys probably heard
[56:27.300 --> 56:31.380]  me talk about Backblaze before unless you're new to the show. And if you are new to the
[56:31.380 --> 56:34.900]  show, what what what is wrong with you, you should be you should have been listening to
[56:34.900 --> 56:44.420]  the show for four months at the very least. Backblaze is online backup, unlimited, unthrottled
[56:44.420 --> 56:52.140]  for your Mac. You install the software, everything on your Mac, all of it, everything on your
[56:52.140 --> 56:56.240]  hard drive, everything on external drives you have plugged into your Mac gets backed
[56:56.240 --> 57:04.600]  up online securely to Backblaze their servers in the cloud. They have over 100 petabytes
[57:04.600 --> 57:09.960]  of data backed up. Now I had a couple weeks ago, I asked to clarify this a petabyte is
[57:09.960 --> 57:19.180]  1000 terabytes, or perhaps, you know, cement to be pedantic. It's 1024 terabytes. So that's
[57:19.180 --> 57:27.860]  the next level up from a terabyte. They have over 100 petabytes of data backed up. Anyone
[57:27.860 --> 57:33.420]  I guess can back up your data. But what do you what about getting it back? Well, Backblaze
[57:33.420 --> 57:40.980]  has just crossed the 6 billion files restored mark. In other words, users of Backblaze have
[57:40.980 --> 57:48.860]  restored over 6 billion files from their cloud based servers. You can access your data anywhere.
[57:48.860 --> 57:53.220]  They have an iPhone app lets you access and share any of your files. So while you're on
[57:53.220 --> 57:59.980]  the phone, you can log into back open Backblaze the app, go there, navigate to any file and
[57:59.980 --> 58:03.500]  you can email it to somebody. So if you're out and about and somebody says, Hey, give
[58:03.500 --> 58:07.060]  me that file, you know, it's on your Mac, you know, Backblaze has backed it up, you
[58:07.060 --> 58:11.680]  can get to it right from your phone, email it or whatever you want to do with it right
[58:11.680 --> 58:18.340]  from there. When you do restore, you can restore one file at a time, a couple of files or all
[58:18.340 --> 58:24.380]  your files easily with the web restore. 25% of all Backblaze restores are just one file
[58:24.380 --> 58:29.780]  at a time. It's not just for computer disasters. It might just be because you want to access
[58:29.780 --> 58:35.020]  one file when you're on another machine. I always mentioned this Backblaze was founded
[58:35.020 --> 58:42.460]  by former Apple engineers, it runs native on your Mac, and on Mavericks. And here's
[58:42.460 --> 58:47.020]  the thing, the price is just unbelievable. There's no add ons, no gimmicks, no upsells,
[58:47.020 --> 58:53.740]  no additional charges. It's just five bucks a month per computer. For unlimited unthrottled
[58:53.740 --> 58:58.560]  backup, you will sleep so much better knowing that everything on your computer is backed
[58:58.560 --> 59:05.580]  up off site, out of your house out of your office. You just install it and forget it
[59:05.580 --> 59:12.820]  until you need it. Five bucks a month, you can get in risk free, no credit card required
[59:12.820 --> 59:17.620]  trial. Just go there. Don't give me a credit card, just download it and try it out. And
[59:17.620 --> 59:24.660]  here's where you go go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball backblaze.com slash daring
[59:24.660 --> 59:30.580]  fireball. Really encourage everybody if you haven't done it already, try them out. One
[59:30.580 --> 59:34.900]  of the other pieces I've seen this month, you did a piece on I think this was probably
[59:34.900 --> 59:41.940]  in the aftermath of your mega what how many pieces how many laptops did you review? 29
[59:41.940 --> 59:50.780]  I had about 20 laptops, Windows laptops sitting at my desk. You did a yeoman's work you did.
[59:50.780 --> 59:56.620]  Here's all 20 laptops of you know, right now today. It's back to school season. It's early
[59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.820]  August people are a lot of a lot of kids are going to be buying getting new laptops. Here's
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.140]  you know, the summary we can talk about that in a bit. But in the aftermath of that you
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.740]  also did a Hey, enough with the crapware piece. And yeah, with advice on that. And that's
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.700]  like one of those things where it's like as a longtime Mac user, it's like, I can't believe
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.280]  that that's still a thing. I know. I can't believe it's still a thing. You know, I used
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.740]  to review PCs like one a week, right. And I just used to be something I like knew I
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:28.820]  would be dealing with. And I guess I just, I thought maybe when Windows eight came, like,
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.980]  where were they going to put the crapware? Were they going to put it on the tile screens?
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:37.900]  Well, they just kept putting it on the tile screens and on the on the desktop. But yeah,
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:45.540]  it's just, you know, nothing. It could be one of the things that makes me I don't know
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.220]  if I get more angry at the pop ups that come up. Like if you're doing something like I
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.340]  was, you know, writing my column and something and then like three McAfee or Norton pop up
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.780]  ads come at you and you're like, you know, I already told you I'm not going to reboot
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:04.220]  the system or give you my email address right now. Or when you open up the laptop and you
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:12.340]  have eBay ads on your desktop. It's like, really eBay is like, why is that the strategy
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]  at this point?
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.540]  Why does eBay even want to be involved in like, I understood five years ago why eBay
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.700]  was on my debt and was doing that right. But like now really eBay like, let's get with
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:28.220]  the times like real I just who is really getting invested in eBay because it's sitting on their
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.500]  desktop.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.700]  I've heard it said though, that you know, and the reason that that's such a problem
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:37.660]  is that whole that whole race that the race to the bottom pricing wise, sure, in the PC
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:42.440]  market. And I don't know if it was Ben Thompson, or somebody but I've heard it said before
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:47.300]  and it makes sense intuitively at some level that that when you're selling a laptop for
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:53.580]  $350 or something like that, you're, you're really not making any money on the hardware
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:58.340]  at all. And that the only money somebody like Dell makes when they sell $350 laptop is whatever
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:04.820]  they get from stuff like McAfee, or Norton, or whoever else is in those things like that
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.660]  the money they get from those deals is really the only money they get period.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:15.700]  But but I come back to eBay, because because it's eBay's fault for keeping I mean, they
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.820]  must get a lot of traffic from these things, right? They must get they must be there must
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:24.660]  be some reason there must be getting some return on their investment here. But I just
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.220]  I think that this could be the problem why eBay has fallen behind some of these other
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:34.340]  retailer e tailor sites is like, figure out a better marketing method than spamming me
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.260]  as soon as I open my windows a computer.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.460]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, no, I think it's it's it. You've got
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.960]  a problem, not just with your marketing, but probably with your product as well, if your
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:52.320]  marketing campaign is you strategizing against your users, right? You know, it doesn't matter
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.140]  what field really bothers me.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.780]  Dr. Angela Brintlinger You know, no one's opening their computer,
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.320]  maybe maybe this is happening. Maybe someone is opening their computer seeing eBay and
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.300]  being like, you know what, I should really go sell that old coffee maker I have on eBay.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.340]  Trenton Larkin Thank you for interrupting me in the middle
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:14.380]  of me trying to do something else to do that. I'm reminded of a couple years ago for a while
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:21.380]  long while it seemed the only pop up ads I ever saw, like our pop under ads, it was were
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:28.020]  from Netflix, like, yeah, and that, you know, I had Safari and Chrome with built in pop
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.720]  under blocking. And it, you know, somehow and doesn't surprise me that Netflix was able
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.760]  to figure out, you know, was the, you know, a company that was smart enough to figure
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.340]  out loopholes through the pop under blocking. But it always struck me as why are they doing
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.060]  this? Why is Netflix of all companies, a company that I want to like that I do, right? Why
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.700]  are they paying for these pop under ads?
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.380]  Dr. Angela Brintlinger No, you're totally right. I would come back
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.780]  to my computer and I'd have a Netflix ad up on my screen.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.140]  Trenton Larkin It was they were the only ones I ever saw
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:01.060]  like, and I, you know, I got on the one hand, I sort of salute their their ingenuity for
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:05.280]  being the one company that was figuring out how to get around the built in pop up and
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.500]  pop under blockers. But on the other hand, it's work Netflix. Yeah, but why are they
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.700]  doing this thing that makes me think about maybe going over to Netflix and canceling
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.700]  my subscription?
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.620]  Dr. Angela Brintlinger Right. Yeah. And that was probably before
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.020]  Netflix really had hit it big. I mean, I don't know. I don't know the last time I've seen
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020]  it.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.260]  Trenton Larkin No, yeah, it's been a it's been a long time.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.780]  But I at the time, when I remember seeing them and being annoyed, they were still more
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:35.260]  of a disk service than a streaming service. But it just seemed like an odd, very odd branding
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:43.300]  choice to associate themselves with a form of advertising that, that browsers explicitly,
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.820]  that the browsers advertise, we block this stuff.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:50.060]  Dr. Angela Brintlinger Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, it was it's
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:55.360]  very frustrating to that even on the highest end Windows laptops, you're still getting
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.500]  some of that, some of these crapware pieces. Because I'm just I'm just thinking through
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.700]  I'm thinking, you know, the Acer that I talked about in that quick sidebar that I wrote to
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:11.020]  the laptop piece, that's a that's a $1,300 computer, you can get it now for 999, or what
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:17.820]  I think it was 899 at Microsoft stores. And I I really did a lot of shilling there from
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.020]  I mean, I'm basically telling everyone go buy your your computers at Microsoft stores,
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.220]  because a you're getting these really good deals on them. And then B, they're not selling
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.060]  them with junkware. So everyone buy your computers from Microsoft stores, if you're in the market
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:35.580]  for a Windows PC, but I had gotten this one from Acer. And I mean, this is a third it
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:39.760]  comes with a nice case, the box smelled good. I mean, like the whole thing is like a really
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:45.500]  premium package, you cannot even believe Acer made this computer. I mean, I can remember
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.420]  reviewing some of the worst, some of the worst technology that I remember reviewing came
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.660]  from Acer, like, terrible laptops years ago. And so like, you look at this beautiful piece
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.820]  of hardware, you open up the thing, and then you see Norton, eBay, tons of third party
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:06.220]  apps that you're just like, we're, you know, I think they were from some sort of Chinese.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:12.620]  What's a AB word processor or something like that, I can't really remember the name of
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:17.100]  the company. But you know, like, you've just paid really, like, you paid a lot of money
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:22.980]  for a really nice computer. Why is this stuff still sitting here? Clearly, I'm very angry
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980]  about it.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:29.700]  I do. Well, I think I think it's worth getting angry about, though, I do. Because especially,
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:34.780]  you know, especially for the ones that you pay a premium for, like, if you're if you're
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:40.600]  buying a two or $300 laptop, it still stinks that you're getting loaded with the getting
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.220]  loaded with crapware. But you can understand the economics of it. But again, like you said,
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:52.220]  a $999 laptop, if your laptop is $100 more than the entry level MacBook, that's, that's,
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.680]  you know, you're in a premium price zone, like, famously, Apple's, you know, MacBooks
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:02.780]  are start at the high end of prices. And there's really I just can't see how it's Why are you
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:06.340]  nickel nickel and diming them? Yeah, yeah, you're I made it but it's exactly what you
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.460]  said before. It's that that's where many of these companies are making profit and the
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.560]  sales teams from Acer to Dell to all these are convincing these people that it's great
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.560]  real estate.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:19.140]  But on a 999 laptop or a 1399 laptop, that shouldn't be where they're making a profit.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:23.900]  They should be able to, you know, make a profit selling that with a clean version of Windows.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.900]  That's true.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.300]  Here's a question.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.880]  But these are the add ons that they're, you know, it's better for them. And then on top
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.480]  of it, they they skin the browsers. That's another thing Acer does still. Yeah. Really?
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.360]  How do they what does that mean? That means there's there's like a toolbar, like a toolbar
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:47.780]  that's pre loaded in the browser. But yet again, 1998 yet again with eBay. Wow. I mean,
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:54.080]  the eBay stuff really bothers me. I'm not sure why. Like maybe it was a link to a better
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:59.240]  I just don't do that much stuff on eBay anymore. Yeah. You know, Amazon's in the same business
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:07.800]  Amazon. I think it maybe it was Toshiba pre loads their pre loads an Amazon app. I don't
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.960]  know. Wow. Yeah, I should have done this more scientifically and done it.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.220]  What about the Chromebooks? Now Chromebooks are really low price points. You know, for
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.780]  the most part, I mean, you know, like the, the, the, what's the Google one, the pixel
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:28.220]  aside, right. But most of them, you know, the whole point of them is that they're sort
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:35.300]  of the new netbooks pricing wise. Are they do they come with crapware? No, no. And and
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:44.380]  Google is very strict about what these OEMs can put on. Are they are just like Android
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.600]  in some ways, you know, where they have sort of these strict guidelines. I mean, obviously,
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.700]  you know, they let people customize, they're way more controlled when it comes to Chromebooks.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:59.140]  So I wonder if Microsoft can't enforce it, just because of the remaining fallout from
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:06.420]  the 1997 antitrust stuff, that they can't, maybe they can't bring the hammer down and
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.700]  say you can't because I know, you know, because Ben Thompson used to work at Microsoft and
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:15.900]  he's, you know, been explicit about it publicly that it's a huge frustration inside the halls
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:24.780]  in Redmond, that the windows that most people see is so junked up. Yeah, right from the
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:29.340]  start. Well, I mean, it does affect performance. There's no doubt that it affects performance.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:33.460]  You know, this was just stuff that you could just sweep away and put it in like a little
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.020]  folder. That's one but this stuff affects performance. You have these things popping
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.580]  up. I you know, one of the apps opened because it told me I had to like, you know, do I want
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:46.900]  to agree or whatever. And the wild tangent games. That's a whole other situation where
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:50.300]  if you open that up, that's running in the browser, and they've got another app that's
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:56.780]  running. So yeah, I mean, no doubt Microsoft has been upset about this stuff for forever.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.780]  And that's why they're, they're offering it in their stores without this. Yeah. And I
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:07.320]  think that it's, you know, for a long time, I mean, Apple's always focused on a lot of
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:14.740]  effort on a first run experience on good stuff like good packaging and stuff like that. Even
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.620]  before you turn a device on that it you should be already be having a good experience just
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:23.580]  opening the box. And for a long time, they were unique in that regard, because they were
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.660]  sort of the wild stepchild of the industry. But you know, anybody who's successful, people
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.360]  are going to start studying what they do. And clearly, Apple's, you know, over the last
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:38.580]  10 years is the most successful gadget maker in the industry. And I think it's caught on
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.700]  and everybody is, you know, the average packaging in general, like you're saying that even an
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.340]  Acer comes with good packaging now. I think that's packaging. I think that's the Apple
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:51.440]  effect. It smells almost as good as an app as a MacBook. And yes, you know, this this
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.260]  thing about laptop smells is very important. I you know, I remember I used to have in college,
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:04.060]  I had a one of my jobs, like an internship was more or less like an IT job. And so sometimes
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:10.300]  I give a new department was getting a new shipment of computers in I know exactly what
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.900]  you're talking about. We used to get Dells at this place. And you know, we'd have like
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:19.220]  eight boxes to open and they did there was like a bad smell like I don't know, like an
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:27.500]  acidic, plasticky smell. Yeah. Um, I think there was an HP or a couple of years ago.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:33.820]  No, no, no, no. It was Dell last year where people were complaining that their laptop,
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:40.300]  the new laptops were smelling like urine. I remember that I do remember that. And people
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:45.620]  were writing in and it had something to do with like the glue or some sort of thing.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:51.100]  Yeah, I mean, you can get a bad smelling laptop. I mean, mostly though, like, I have this like,
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:56.480]  I just love the smell of new laptop. It's like a new car. You know, I have I, I'm really
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.020]  showing my hands here on this podcast. I know exactly what you mean. No, no, no, it's like
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:07.140]  a new MacBook smells really good. I mean, it's like, and a new MacBook Air even better.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:12.900]  Yeah, yeah. It's no coincidence. You know, that's not just by chance. It's about you
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.220]  caring about stuff like that and using good materials and not using cheap glue. And yeah,
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.980]  but I do remember that like, like when we would have like, hey, eight new PCs came in,
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:26.780]  we got to set them up. And it was, you know, it wasn't like, like, you know, there's people
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.940]  who work with raw sewage. I mean, there are a lot worse smells that people have on a regular
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:35.260]  basis on their job, but it wasn't pleasant. Right? We're terrible people. We sit here,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:42.100]  we are horrible people. We have to open up a laptop that doesn't smell good. Oh, my job
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.420]  is so hard.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.900]  But that's interesting. It is interesting to me, though, that Chromebooks don't have
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:54.180]  that problem, you know, and the first run experience, like here, I've got this new thing.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:59.100]  I, you know, I just bought it. And that's when you're like, you know, it's, it's a psychological
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.380]  thing. First impressions really do matter. Okay, turn it on. Here's how I turn it on.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.100]  What's the first thing I see? Am I getting brought, you know, a barrage of ads? Or am
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:12.940]  I getting a, you know, professional designers have, you know, given you this onboarding
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:18.220]  experience to make it pleasant. It matters, because that's like, your first impression
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.140]  of the device, the first time you turn it on, is, is like the starting point of the
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:28.640]  graph of your customer satisfaction with it. Yeah, right. It's not like you, your customer
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.940]  satisfaction doesn't start at zero and start inching up it. Yeah, it's good. It starts
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:37.540]  somewhere based on that first experience, you know, right.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.340]  Or the excitement that you've got a new product, and you're excited to open it. And then it's
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:46.540]  like, you know, is there the record scratch? Or are you you know, is there no happy music?
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.220]  Are you Are you enjoying getting this new thing?
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.500]  Yeah, that's a good point. Because when your devices, it's just like a brand new car, you're
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.820]  excited, you're excited to just go to the grocery store, drive to the grocery store
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.740]  when you have a brand new car, because it's you got a new car. Yeah,
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:06.460]  I mean, I open I open phones all the time. But when I get my own new phone, that is a
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.700]  different experience. Right? I'm like, this is mine. Like this is this is going to be
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:16.380]  mine for however long, you know, the foreseeable future for years, many, many people keep their
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.420]  laptops, you know, all right. I think that's what it used to be. I don't know now if that's
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.420]  the case, but
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:24.900]  I think it's longer and longer. I think that, you know, I think that's part of the problem
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.660]  that the PC industry is facing. Right? I said people are holding them longer because they're
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.940]  doing stuff like, you know, they don't feel like they need a new PC that often because
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:36.700]  they're doing so much on their tablets, right, or surfing, or they're just, you know, in
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:42.100]  the web browser, and they don't need to have the other power that is that they have. Yeah.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.880]  But that is interesting to me that that Google enforces that pretty tight even on these devices
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.220]  that are selling for as low as 250 bucks. Yeah, definitely. I mean, mostly also, they
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:57.160]  don't you do the hardware is so low end, you know, when you even this Acer, I have the
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:04.960]  299 c 720, the Chromebook. I mean, this is not a nice feeling computer, but it's fine
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.300]  for the price. Yeah.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:15.300]  I've seen it. And I know that it's, it's the, I think it's one of the main ways that Chromebooks
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:21.220]  are starting to actually have an effect on the industry is like k 12 education. Sure.
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:26.200]  Yeah, like at my son's school, they do have some iPads, but it's an awful lot of Chromebooks.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:32.820]  And like when they do writing and stuff like that. It's in a Chromebook and in Google Docs.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.420]  Yeah, and I can't really blame them. And and it's funny talking to my son about it. He
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.740]  and his friends, they do complain about them because most of these kids have like Apple
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:46.060]  stuff at home. And they even complain about the things being this isn't like, like, my
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.220]  son playing to me and knowing this, if anything, he would tease me and if he if he knew better,
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:56.020]  he'd tease me and tell me how much he likes the Chromebook. It's just, you know, me subtly
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:02.940]  gauging his opinions like, Oh, yeah, it's a real piece of junk. You know, like the trackpad.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:06.460]  You know, and the kids are not I've said this before kids today are nuts about things like
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.620]  frame rate because it's all from the games. And you know, even even just using the Chromebook
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:15.500]  for schoolwork. It's like he's like on terrible frame rate. Yeah. He says frame rate. Yeah.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:20.260]  Oh, kids today. Kids today are nuts about frame rates. And they all know 60. Everybody
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.660]  knows that 60 is what you want that you want 60 frames per second.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:29.380]  I hold on. I think I think kids definitely know slow now because like they're like my
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.540]  iPad doesn't do that. But do you think maybe only your kid knows the word frame rate?
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:41.420]  No, definitely not. Because they watch they all watch YouTube videos nonstop of video
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.820]  games. Yep. And while they this is this is what kids like Minecraft. It doesn't matter
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:51.020]  whether yeah, Minecraft, the you know, the Arkham Batman game doesn't matter what games
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.380]  you play. What you do as a kid today is you start playing a video game on device A could
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:02.180]  be your phone and it could be your iPad could be you know, like a Wii U or whatever. And
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:08.540]  then on device B, you watch videos of people playing the same game right at the same time.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:12.740]  And it's you know, it's nonstop chatter about things like frame rate and stuff like that.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:20.740]  It's not from like a Trust me, he's not unusual. He's 10. Oh my god. And trust me, frame rates,
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.580]  frame rates are a huge deal. That's so funny. And this is really I you know, I didn't even
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:30.860]  think about that. I mean, I at work, the the makeup artist, her daughter talks to me about
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:35.900]  Minecraft constantly. And she and she's constantly, you know, telling me Oh, well, I saw this
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.140]  video of Minecraft. And you know, they built this and they did that. So I totally know
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.540]  what you're I just I the idea that like a kid would be sitting like, Oh, yeah, the frame
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.260]  rate on this Chromebook is terrible. Like the fact that a kid would be saying that is
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:51.660]  amazing to me. And so I thought in my head like, Oh, yeah, of course. Of course, john's
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:57.100]  No, but it's not. Yeah, you would. That would make some degree of sense. But it's not. It
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.780]  isn't. It's just common. Like the one of the most disparaging words like a fourth or fifth
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:08.780]  grader can use to describe something is laggy. laggy is lagginess is a huge issue. All these
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:14.100]  kids are gonna be way better reviewers than I am. Yeah, it's a huge deal with all the
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:18.420]  kids who are into Minecraft, because like Minecraft is so extensible, you can plug in
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:25.100]  like new shaders, so that you can get right total totally different graphics engine.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.380]  But it slows the hell down, right? It's, it's, you know, if you're running it on like a MacBook
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.620]  Air or something like that, you get lagginess. And it's, that's, that's a, this is the worst
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.700]  thing that could possibly happen. It's horrible. But anyway, I can totally see why schools
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.720]  are loading up on these things. Because if I were going to put devices in the hands of
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.700]  fourth and fifth graders, you know, it makes an awful lot of sense to give them a $200
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.340]  thing that if they drop and needs to be replaced, you know, it's not going to crack like like
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:19:01.140]  an iPad. Right. Yeah. And that also ties into another thing that you've written about recently,
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.260]  which I wanted to mention, which is the you did a whole thing on. Do you still need that
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:12.340]  Microsoft Office? Yeah, you see the pattern here. It was it was Microsoft August. Yeah,
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:17.140]  in my life. It just happened that those topics sort of were in a good succession because
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:23.620]  I did the laptop piece. And obviously, you know, the piece led with recommending the
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:28.100]  air. And I got a lot of emails from people saying, Well, how am I supposed to use the
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.700]  air without Microsoft Office. And so I had to write back to people and explain to them
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:36.700]  that Microsoft Office has been available for the air for a really long time. And
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:45.500]  forever. Yeah, I'm pretty sure if Microsoft Excel shipped on the Mac first, it was
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.300]  you know, and well, and to their credit, some people wrote back and said, Yes, but it's
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:54.260]  a far inferior product on on the Mac. And I said, I actually agree. I use Microsoft
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:00.060]  Office on on my Mac. And I actually run parallel sometimes to run Windows, I mean, Microsoft
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.860]  Office 365, because you get a better outlook experience, blah, blah, blah. So it just started
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:09.620]  getting, you know, my be thinking, Okay, well, maybe we should do a piece right now explaining
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:15.020]  to people that maybe they don't need Microsoft Office. And so yeah, that was that was that
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.540]  piece. And then it just happened to be that that Windows eight was Windows Phone eight
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:25.780]  was launching on this HTC. And so every week, I feel like as if I've been giving a nice
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:29.680]  look at what's going on in Redmond. Well, and I do think that there's an interesting
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:35.620]  angle there on education, where, you know, like in my son's school, like a lot of the
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:43.820]  stuff he does, it gets turned into the teacher by Google Docs, that you don't have documents,
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.620]  there's no you don't save stuff to your hard drive and then print it out and hand it in.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:54.380]  It's, you know, he, I'm not even sure exactly what the steps are that he does. But it's,
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:21:01.900]  you know, it's completely through the school's Google Docs thing, Google Office thing.
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:08.500]  Yeah, I mean, I my entire editing process is now done in Google Docs. I mean, we when
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:13.940]  I deal with the print editors, we move back to Word. But when I deal with my direct editor,
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:19.140]  we're we're just completely in Google Docs. And it's a great, I mean, I compared Office
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:24.660]  or Word online and Excel online and PowerPoint online, to Google Docs. And then also what
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:30.500]  Apple has been doing with iCloud pages and spreadsheets and arriving with numbers and
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:35.980]  Keynote. And you know, all of those platforms have added really substantial sharing and
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:41.980]  collaboration features. But Google still has just it's it's really built into the platform,
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.700]  like you can tell that that's where this was built like this, that was the main reason
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:51.860]  they built some of these features or these platforms like it's almost like I and I think
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.500]  this is actually true. I think Google built Google Docs so they would be able to collaborate
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:01.140]  on documents rather than just have something that lived in the cloud. And it feels that
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.180]  way, like the sharing capabilities are better than being able to comment on what somebody's
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:09.500]  written, being able to live edit and watch them live edit. It all works better still
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.660]  on Google stuff.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:16.660]  Yeah, and I do think that it's a good, I think you're exactly right, that it's, it really
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:20.540]  matters where the product started. Right. Right.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:25.220]  I have to say Apple, the new iCloud pages, I don't know if you've tried the sharing functionality,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.060]  but they have some interesting stuff in there that I actually, you know, there were a couple
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:33.060]  small features. I'm like, I wish Google Docs had this now. So you know, they've got it,
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:36.860]  they're still playing catch up on some of the other things like commenting, like seeing
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:41.780]  some of that live editing. Um, but like if I sent you my, my iCloud pages thing, now
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.660]  you don't have to log in at all. You can just create a name, like you can just write, you
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:49.860]  know, Gruber and you can just jump into the document without having to log in at all.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.780]  And I think that's actually a feature that Google over.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.720]  And the big thing too is that you don't, I mean the whole basis of all of that sharing
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:02.060]  is that you don't have to coordinate any, okay, I'm going to open it now. Don't, don't
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:07.740]  make any changes on your site. Like Dropbox is an amazing, amazing service. But like if
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:13.180]  you're sharing a document between two people on Dropbox, like an app that's not meant,
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:19.220]  doesn't really isn't aware of Dropbox. Just open it up in numbers or whatever. Uh, you
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.460]  can easily run into problems even just with yourself if you have it open on two machines
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.540]  at the same time where you make changes on one side and different changes on the other
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:35.380]  side. And now you've, you know, you're overwriting it as opposed to, um, well, and having it
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:41.140]  set up, you know, Google docs from day one where as you type in the document that on
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:48.140]  your end, the keystroke show up on mine, right? Right. And it's, it's, um, meant to be used
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:52.580]  by different people at the same time and, and meant for that as opposed to the problems
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:59.900]  you can run into with apps that are rooted in a design where it's your file on your computer.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:05.860]  Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, I mean, I was actually
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:09.180]  really impressed where, where Apple's gone with that. I mean, Microsoft has had a lot
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:13.660]  of these features and they're getting better. Um, but the problem with, with Microsoft is
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:18.300]  they're still trying to bring these features to the desktop version and it just doesn't
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:23.020]  work there. It just really doesn't work there. Yeah. And the other thing too, and you see
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.460]  it, you know, there's actually the same problem with pages. You know, the sharing is really
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:30.100]  good in iCloud pages, but when you try and do it from the desktop app, it's, it's not
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:34.360]  as good. Yeah. And that's a real problem. I think it's a real problem because the desktop
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.920]  version in every other regard is better, you know, in terms of just, you know, like going
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.020]  back to lagginess and stuff like that. Like, you know, native, uh, apps run better than
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:51.500]  apps that are jury rigged through HTML and JavaScript and CSS. But you're right though
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:55.480]  that the sharing stuff doesn't work as well. Like in terms of live updates and stuff that
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.900]  they're still like these routes of an old school, you know, your file saved to your
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:08.240]  hard disk mentality there. Right. But I mean, you know, when you look at the whole ecosystem
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:13.760]  of things, I mean, you know, as I talked about in this piece is like, you know, it ultimately
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.920]  comes down to what, what would you want to pay for? And I, and I conclude, you know,
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:24.800]  there's no reason to pay for office anymore if you just need the basics and you can get
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.980]  those. And even if you prefer using the office interface, you can get all of that for free
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:35.660]  now through word and Excel and PowerPoint online. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:40.860]  But I do, and I wonder too how, how it's going to play out with, um, cause it's the sort
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:46.420]  of thing like it doesn't happen with everything. I try to focus on the big picture as much
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.220]  as I can. I think I do a better job than, than a lot of people who write about tech,
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:57.220]  but it's so hard to look past just even the next year, but it's some things take five,
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:03.160]  six, seven, 10 years. Like what happens when like today's 10 year olds are freshmen in
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.740]  college eight years from now, I think Microsoft office is going to seem like, you know, like
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:14.780]  using a mainframe from the sixties. Like nobody's going to be using that. I couldn't agree more.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:20.180]  I think, I think when you look at, well, it's, it's two things. One, it's the idea of installing
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:26.220]  software in, in the regards that you would have to somehow install with, you know, office.
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:31.820]  Of course now kids are really used to using apps, but I think the idea that kids have
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:35.580]  started to get used to is that they can just get that a lot, a lot of that stuff through
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.940]  the web browser. And then second of all, the idea of paying for something like that. I
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:45.060]  mean, I, I just, I don't think it's, I don't think it's the reality in 10 years.
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:49.740]  Yeah. Well, and I think the other thing too is that with the file system mentality to
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:56.780]  submit your work to the teacher, whether it's printed or even if it was like, you know,
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.360]  I'm sure there's a lot of people who, you know, certainly since I've been in school,
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.500]  but who've been able to email their homework to their teachers and stuff like that. But
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.980]  when you do something like that, you're sending a copy. It doesn't matter whether it's a hard
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:14.020]  copy or still a digital copy. It's okay. I've, I've sent a copy of this document as an email
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:19.220]  attachment and now there's a copy of it. That, that whole, there's a bunch of different copies
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:24.660]  of it. Mentality is right. It's not like the live living thing, right? Right. Here's this,
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.680]  this one URL and it's the same URL from my end as a student. It's where I go to type
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.900]  and from the teacher's end, it's just where they bring it up to read it and put their
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:40.740]  remarks and you'd not, you know, the, the, the whole issue of having various versions
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:44.940]  of a document copied and you know, who's got the right version. And now the teacher sent
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:50.940]  me a new copy back with, you know, with their comments. It's craziness from, I think from
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.980]  kids' perspective today. Right. They're just not even going to get it. They don't even
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.540]  going to understand it. Right. And that's where, you know, who knows if we'll be paying
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:02.700]  for cloud storage then. I mean, if all signs point to us not really paying for cloud storage
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:09.660]  even now at this point, I mean, we're paying what for a terabyte of storage, $10 a month.
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:14.380]  Expecting that to go down. I mean, so the, that sort of equation where you think I'm
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:19.840]  not paying for the software, but I'm paying for this platform to keep these documents
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.740]  alive and not save them to my, like as you're saying, I'm not saving them as a file. I'm
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:30.300]  not saving them as a copy. Seems to make more sense for the structure of these types of
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.500]  services. Yeah. Which is, you know, where, where Microsoft is going with this office
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:40.140]  365 thing. Yeah, I think that they see it, but I still think even though that they see
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:45.380]  it and I think they're doing great work with it. They're still in a dangerous spot where
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:49.360]  they're, they're, they seem to need to, you know, financially they need to protect the
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.900]  existing right operation than the existing business. And it's in conflict with the future.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:02.980]  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Now it's, it's, it's been an interesting couple of columns
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:12.020]  to look at Microsoft and how they try and figure out how they form or fit into the future.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:17.020]  You know, even, even from the, the windows laptop piece that I wrote, you know, when
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:22.340]  you look at, when you look at the problems and the thoughts that they had about windows
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:26.680]  eight and where they've sort of ended up now, which is really kind of coming full circle
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:34.040]  back to, okay, we, we can't abandon core windows and we got to sort of come back to the traditional
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.820]  desktop and you look at all of these devices that are supposed to be tablets that are supposed
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:44.140]  to be hybrid machines. And really, I think a lot of people are just using them as traditional
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:49.980]  laptops. You know, it's, it makes you wonder how cyclical some of this stuff is going to
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.980]  be.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:59.920]  Yeah. Let me take a last break right here. Rounding out a group of sponsors, longtime
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:06.260]  sponsors to all of them today on today's show is maybe the longest of longterm sponsors
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:11.860]  of this show. Squarespace are good friends at Squarespace. You've heard me mention them
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:23.140]  before. Um, Squarespace makes it simple and easy to create and publish your own website.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:28.420]  You sign up for Squarespace, you pick one of their amazing, really attractive templates,
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:34.500]  all of which are responsive, ready to go from mobile phone to tablet to any size desktop
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:42.100]  display. Uh, use drag and drop to rearrange the components of the website. Uh, get it
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:48.580]  just the way you want. Uh, and that's it. You just sign up, pick a template, drag and
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:55.340]  drop to customize. And there you go. You've got a website. It could not be easier. Um,
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:01.620]  Squarespace has 24 seven tech support. This is tech support that they want you to use.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.340]  They take pride in it. I think it's maybe their most differentiating feature. Um, this
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.380]  isn't like a, like a checklist, like, yeah, there's somebody you can contact. No, they
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:14.980]  really, if you need help, if you have questions, contact them. They do it through live chat
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:19.260]  and email, no phone because who wants a phone call? I don't want to talk to anybody on the
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:24.740]  phone phone calls like, like 20th century technology. Chat is way better. They'll get
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:30.020]  back to you right away and tech support staff really knows Squarespace inside and out and
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.460]  they really do want you to use them. They've got teams in, uh, Dublin, Ireland, New York
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:39.620]  City and Portland. That's how they cover the whole, that's how they cover 24 seven by having
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:48.140]  teams in Europe, east coast, us, west coast, us. And here's the thing, plan start at just
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:54.260]  eight bucks a month. And if you sign up for a year, you get a free domain, eight bucks
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:58.700]  a month for a totally professional website. And you can do anything with the Squarespace
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.940]  that you can make it a blog. You can use Squarespace to publish a podcast. They've got built in
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.780]  support for that. Uh, you can create a store, you can create a gallery of your photographs
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:13.940]  or your artwork, anything you might want to have a website for. They've got support for,
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:18.780]  uh, including online commerce. Every, every site comes with an online store. If you want
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:26.780]  it handles everything from a security SSL, uh, to credit card, um, purchasing all sorts
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:30.300]  of stuff. That's a huge pain in the ass. A lot of technical hurdles. If you want to roll
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:36.940]  it on your own, Squarespace has it all built in. Uh, so what do you do? You can start a
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:43.260]  trial with no credit card required and start building your own website today. So what you
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:53.180]  do is go to squarespace.com slash Gruber. That's my last name. Squarespace.com slash
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:58.620]  Gruber. That way you know you're coming from the talk show and they'll know you're coming
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:01.820]  from there. You know, you might think, why does Squarespace keep sponsoring the show?
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:06.980]  You know why? Because people like you go there finally decide, Hey, I do need a website.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.620]  Maybe I should check out Squarespace. And when they go, they use that URL or they use
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.580]  the code. There's a code JG. When you actually sign up to pay after you go there and start
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:22.200]  building your website and ready to sign up, use the code JG and you'll save 10% off your
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.980]  first purchase. If you do the thing where you sign up for a year at a time, um, that
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:31.300]  can be a significant amount of money. Uh, use those codes. That's how they know you
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:36.460]  got here from the show and people like you who do that, use that code, use those URLs.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:42.140]  That's how somebody like Squarespace keeps coming back to support the show. Uh, so my
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:46.940]  thanks to Squarespace. Check them out if you have any interest in building a website. Here's
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:52.860]  two more things I wanted to talk to you about after having gone through all those, um, laptops
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:34:00.140]  is first track pads. Like is that still a problem on windows PCs where the track pads
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:04.940]  are just grossly inferior to the Mac book ones or have they finally caught up a little
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:10.500]  bit? No, it's still, it's, it's, it's still one of tech's greatest unsolved problems or
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:15.860]  mysteries. I do not understand why windows PC makers cannot figure out how to make a
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:21.540]  track pad as good as apples. And it's not purely software because everything I've read
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:28.700]  is that when you run a reboot, your Mac book, you know, in windows, it's the best windows
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:33.180]  track pad you'll ever use. Yup. Yup. I did. I did a piece right before I left the verge
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:36.780]  a couple of years ago on why the Mac book air was almost as good of an ultra book as
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:43.180]  any PC maker could make a track pad and keyboard were big part of it. Right. Um, you know,
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:47.740]  I even recommended in this laptop piece that just buy one of these laptops, these windows
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:51.560]  eight laptops with a touch screen. First of all, they're just as, they're just like, they're
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.260]  all competitive on pricing. You basically, even from the $500 range, even down, you can
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.540]  get a windows laptop with a touch screen. So just buy one with a touch screen because
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:05.580]  if you run into these problems with the track pad, you can reach out and touch the screen.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:11.260]  It's almost like a, like a small bandaid on the problem. But, um, yeah, I, you know, in
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:16.740]  some places it's been fixed, like Lenovo's works better than some, um, Asus is, I don't
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:23.580]  understand why that track pad is, it's like trying to use sandpaper. Um, who else made
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:29.300]  a decent one? Uh, Acer's kind of breaks a little bit. I, it's just like, it seems to
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.020]  be the last place they're focusing on. And it's like, that's one of them. I mean, if
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:38.620]  you can't navigate your computer, why do you have a computer? Yeah, it should be one of
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:45.220]  the first, I, especially I, I find, you know, cause I have a desk, I still have a real keyboard
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:49.020]  and stuff at my desk where I try to do most of my writing, but when I'm on my Mac book
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:55.420]  air, it's more, if anything more than at my desk, it's a little bit more consumption.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:36:00.260]  Yeah. And that means like needing to scroll and stuff like that. And if the track pad,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.460]  every time the track pad gives me trouble, it's always annoying. You know, I can't, it's
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:09.820]  central to the experience. To me, the track pad on the air. I mean, I actually, now this
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:16.460]  is an example. I have a Thunderbolt display at my desk at work and you know, some might,
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.980]  I think the it guy said, well, just close your Mac book and just use that and we'll
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:24.820]  get you in a spare keyboard. And I said, no, I don't want to use the, the track pad, the
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.700]  magic track pad. And I really like my air's keyboard. So I want to use that as the home
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:36.940]  base and just look at, at the screen because I, I live with the track pad. I can't use
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:37.940]  a mouse.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:42.180]  Yeah. Well, you know what I've seen and I'm like you, you know, like you in times square,
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:47.020]  just looking at, uh, you know, can I find anybody using a windows phone when I travel?
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:52.660]  I do. I airports, I love to just look at what are people using and on vacation, like at
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.740]  Disney world, uh, what are people taking their pictures with when they're holding their cameras
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:03.060]  and tablets up? What, what kind of device is that? Um, I see so many people, but always
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.660]  with PCs almost never with a Mac book with mice, with mice. I do too. I, I, this is like
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:14.500]  my thing too. I, I pretty much count laptops when I go in coffee shops and like I will
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:18.740]  just do like the mental math, like, okay, yeah, right through like, you know, looking
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:23.780]  at this place, 30% of the people in here are using PCs and, and they're at the, and then
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:29.220]  50% or a hundred percent of those 30% are using, are using mice.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:38.100]  I saw two guys, you know, I, who were obviously colleagues setting up, um, and like the hotel,
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:43.700]  um, I forget where I was, but it was like in a hotel bar slash lounge, you know, but
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:49.420]  a relatively small table. They both had huge laptops, 15 inch PCs, you know, big, not,
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.660]  not air style ones, big ones. Exactly what you're going to say with the tiny mouse,
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:59.060]  but they were on the same table, like, um, battleship style, right? You know what I mean?
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:04.540]  Like the, but it was a small cocktail table with two big laptops. They only had like a
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:10.020]  few inches and they both had mice and they're just, they had to pick up the, you know, they
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.020]  had to keep picking it up to move it around and it's like a Charlie Chaplin skit. Right.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:17.300]  And I was like, wonder what they're doing. You know, just curious as I went to the restaurant,
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:21.460]  I'd like look over and they were both doing something in Excel or some other spreadsheet.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:24.380]  I don't know. It's, you know, but clearly they were doing spreadsheet work, but they
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:29.060]  both with these huge laptops and no room on the table, we're using mice. And I thought,
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:34.540]  man, that is gotta be a sign that, you know, that they've got terrible trackpads. Right.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.900]  Or it's habit. Like I think people have this habit of using mice. They know how to use
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.740]  their keyboard shortcuts with their left hand and they have the right hand on the mouse.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:49.820]  But I don't, I don't know why. Um, I, I, I would say if you asked most people who own
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:55.140]  a MacBook or a MacBook Air, like the number one thing they like about it is the touchpad
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:39:01.460]  or the trackpad. But, you know, this is how the other half lives. I don't, I don't know.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:07.900]  I, I used to tackle it more when I would meet with companies like Synaptics who make the
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:12.660]  sensors and the, and the touch panels for the PCs. And I actually think they do work
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.780]  with Apple as well. And for a while they were, you know, I had heard that Apple had some
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:24.220]  extra IP on certain types of touch and stuff like that. I simply think for most of these,
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.100]  it's just getting the hardware and the software to work better together. And, you know, I
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.620]  thought that's why I have to, you know, I, I was upset a little bit that Microsoft just
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:37.100]  didn't turn the Surface Pro 3 into a laptop. Um, you know, cause my biggest problem with
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:42.620]  that is like, you went pretty far here. You've got a really nice system, but this is not
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:48.580]  a laptop replacement because the keyboard and the trackpad are so crappy. I mean, and
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.080]  that's, I see that also in New York a lot. If I do see someone with a Surface and there's
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.700]  one person at my local coffee shop and she has a Surface 2 and she hangs a little mouse
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:04.860]  from the side and she, you know, cause the, the, the USB ports are on, on the screen,
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:12.440]  right? So you have the mouse hanging from the side of the screen and it's just like,
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:17.020]  this is exactly the problem right here. Like that's just the photo to explain the entire
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:21.980]  review. Like it's not as good of a laptop because the parts that make this a laptop,
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:26.060]  which is a keyboard and a trackpad are not as good as real laptops.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.500]  Right. Well, and that brings me to the flip side of the same thing. The other thing, the
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:40.620]  other thing I wanted to ask you about is the laptop devices with touch screens and Apple's
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:45.140]  explanation for why they haven't done that. I mean, and this is many, this is a years
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:49.160]  old explanation. I mean, Steve Jobs, I think was the one who delivered it. And so it's,
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.500]  you know, gotta be, you know, three, four years is that, you know, they've tried it
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:58.360]  and ergonomically it's unpleasant to just have to stick your arm out. It's just a weird
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:05.100]  angle and it's not, it's not good. And do you find that that's true actually using devices
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:10.420]  like say Chromebooks that have touch screens more, you know, so I re the number one PC
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:15.300]  that I did like was the Lenovo yoga, which if anyone from Lenovo, I'm just going to keep
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:22.620]  saying this, like, you should have called it the Lenovo. I've been calling in the video
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:28.780]  by accident. I'm sure nobody noticed because, well, no, a lot of people did watch that video.
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:36.380]  I called it the Lenovo twice. I did hear that. I did hear that. And one of the editors like,
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.260]  Oh, you need to go do that. I was like, Oh no, it'll notice. And it's like, you know
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:42.380]  what, even if they do notice, this is what they should have called it. This is what they
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:49.820]  should have called it either the Lenovo or just change your name to Lenovo. Anyway, I
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:55.380]  really liked that device because it does do that flipping thing, but the, the touch screen,
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:01.180]  the touch screen's really nice. And so I ended up using the touch screen more when I would,
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:05.340]  I did do the flip thing, you know, the, you flip it around and you can use it as what
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:09.780]  they call it, tablet or stand mode. And I, you know, I did take advantage of that. I,
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:13.860]  you know, would end up just kind of surfing the bed, surfing the bed, surfing the, uh,
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.660]  the web in bed and just do it that way. Um, isn't it weird though, having the buttons
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:22.460]  of the keyboards sticking out on the back? Yeah, it is weird. And this is something that
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:29.780]  like none of these have figured out. I mean, one of the ThinkPad ones, they actually, um,
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.100]  they go up into the, into the thing. What do they call it? They like recess. Yeah. They
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:40.740]  sort of recess, but like, um, yeah, I mean they, I mean they don't work right. Like the
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:45.900]  keyboard is disabled in that mode. Once you fold it around the keyboard board, the keystrokes
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:50.780]  don't don't register. Right. And I, you know, I don't, I, I haven't used these like long
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.980]  enough to see if the wear and tear of, you know, if I were to do that at a coffee shop
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:59.900]  or if I would be doing that on an airplane table or a tray table, if that would be uncomfortable.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:05.660]  Um, but you know, when I was using mostly just to like surf the web in bed, I liked
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:10.020]  the experience. And like I said, I would find myself reaching out to use the screen more
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:13.780]  when let's say the trackpad wasn't working in Internet Explorer or when I'm trying to
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:18.900]  scroll down a long document and that's just an easier way to get through things. The thing
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:26.220]  that I've heard from like in the email I get from, from readers, um, cause there's been
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:31.860]  a lot more speculation, growing speculation as ARM processors get faster and faster and
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:36.980]  they have such energy advantages over Intel processors, you know, speculation would Apple
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:42.780]  ever, you know, make a Mac with ARM processors. And every time I linked to something like
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.740]  that or speculated about it myself, I usually get a couple of emails from people saying,
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:52.380]  well, what if, what if it's not, what if they do switch and start making laptops with ARM
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:56.640]  processors, but they don't run Mac OS, they run iOS, you know, that that's what a lot
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.900]  of people want is like, not, not like the surface where it's a cover that you detach
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:07.820]  with the keyboard, but an actual like Mac book air form factor, but it's running iOS
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:14.420]  and then, but you know, and, and, um, I was just listening to eight, the, uh, accidental
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:20.300]  tech podcast, uh, the most recent episode and John Siracusa pointed out on the show,
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:24.620]  first question is, well then what's the input? Is there, is there, do you add a mouse? There
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:29.420]  is no mouse in iOS and you know, do you have to reach out and you, do you have to reach
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:36.220]  out and touch the screen all the time? Like how pleasant is that in real life to use the
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:42.400]  touch screen while it's a true laptop form factor? Right. Well, I mean, part of part,
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:45.140]  like part of what I'm saying with windows eight is that the touch screen is still very
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:50.060]  much a crutch, right? Like it's a crutch for, for the track pad issues. And it's also
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.420]  a crutch for the fact that windows eight was not designed, you know, they, they tried to
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.260]  layer on top a touch interface. So one of the easiest ways to swipe through apps is
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:04.340]  just to, you know, swipe them from the side. And those are other situations where I find
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.100]  when I'm using windows eight, I just reach out and use this and touch the screen. So
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:11.340]  it's definitely for me, you know, now that I'm really thinking about it, those are the
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:15.640]  two main times when I would use the touch screen to scroll through things or to swipe
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:27.140]  in other apps from the sides. Yeah, I think, you know, I guess, I guess the question when
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:34.100]  I think about iOS, you know, I can't really imagine using it with a with a with a mouse.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:40.060]  No, I can't either. And it's really unpleasant. If you like as a developer, if you just you
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:44.500]  can, you can do it, you can run iOS apps as a developer on your Mac when you're testing
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.680]  it. And it's horrible. It's really, really bad sitting there and clicking around things
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.140]  on with the mouse. And I'm sure they could somehow make it a little better and add shortcuts
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:57.500]  like so that you could, you know, two fingers scroll or something. I don't know, but the
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:02.380]  only place you would want to do it and I don't work on my iPad that much anymore. But when
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:07.740]  I used to write things on my iPad, you know, I guess I would want it for maneuvering through
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:14.700]  tighter menus in in office or whatever. Well, and a mouse cursor is way easier for exact
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:19.460]  placement. Yep. And forgetting the insertion point right in the middle of the word between
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:23.940]  the two letters where you want to, you know, fix a typo or something like that. Right.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.780]  But I don't know, it just seems to me like two different universes. But the other thing
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:31.220]  I hear from readers a lot is that they'll say stuff like, Hey, you know, it's funny.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:35.860]  I never thought that I'd like a touchscreen Mac either. But I was on vacation, you know,
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:39.980]  for a week, and I didn't take my Mac, I only took my iPad, and I came back to work. And
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:44.500]  I, without thinking, found myself reaching out and touching my screen, and expecting
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:50.020]  stuff to move. It's like, you know, yeah, I mean, that's a real thing. I do. I understand
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:53.100]  that. But still seems to me like two different worlds.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:57.140]  It does seem like two different worlds. But there are certain places, I think we're describing
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:01.120]  it, where there are certain apps that we feel really comfortable reaching out and touching
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:07.140]  the screen. Then there are the certain apps where we feel way more comfortable using a
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:14.940]  keyboard and touchpad or a cursor. And that's, you know, Microsoft likes to give you that
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:24.180]  option. Yeah. But of course, Microsoft designed the operating system around touch. Yeah. And
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:29.640]  I think I think that's what Apple says, you know, Apple says, you know, this operating
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:35.660]  system was just not designed for touch. Right. And this other one is. Right. And this other
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:42.980]  one is. That said, I'm still, you know, I mean, and that's one of the problems I sometimes
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:47.500]  have with some of the keyboard docs for the iPad is like, you start to want to do more.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:50.700]  And I wrote that piece a couple months ago, and we talked about it, which was like tablets
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:57.520]  for work, that when you attach a keyboard to a tablet, you start to want to do more.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.240]  And sometimes that wasn't designed for that, right? Like, if I attach a keyboard to my
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.940]  iPad, I start to want to be able to multitask better, I start to want to be able to type
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:13.060]  and do keyboard shortcuts and easily swipe up on the on some sort of trackpad to get
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:22.020]  to something versus, you know, the opposite, which is, you know, when you're when you don't
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:26.700]  have the keyboard, you you sort of feel more limited, but you're not trying to do more.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.020]  I think that about brings us to an anything else you wanted to talk about this week? Anything
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:35.860]  else on your mind? Anything else on my mind? I don't know. I've got an ice bucket challenge
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:41.660]  to do. Oh, I saw that. I've been I've been I've been, you know, I have to say I was for
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:46.060]  you know, you're like, sort of like, I'm the last person to be picked for the gym class
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:50.980]  team, you know, because I hadn't been tagged in the ice bucket challenge. But I also had
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:57.020]  like, two weeks to sit back and watch it. I what I thought was very stupid videos. So
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.340]  I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with this.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:04.740]  I saw something about that. This is this if I can't imagine there's anybody who hasn't
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.180]  seen this yet, but the it's for ALS, the aka Lou Gehrig disease. And I've seen some people
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:16.940]  and not people who are trying to be cynical, but people who are like, you know, is the
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.380]  point to raise money or those the point to make these goofy videos, right. But I saw
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:26.100]  somebody say that they've they've raised like this, they do. It's like an annual campaign
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:31.060]  to raise money for ALS. And that this year's campaign is something. It's already like 10
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:36.920]  times more money than they raised in 2013. So it is, you know, it is in fact proving
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.580]  to be incredibly successful, from their perspective as a fundraising thing.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:45.140]  Well, the what the thing that really confused me, you know, early on in the week, or was
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:49.580]  the end of last week, which was like, okay, the celebrities were getting in on the game.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.100]  And, you know, from the start, it was from from what I'd understood from Facebook videos
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:58.100]  that I'd watch for my friends. It was like, either or right, either you dump this on your
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.780]  head, or you give the money.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:05.120]  Yeah, yeah. And I think that's what's what's making some people like, hey, shouldn't Tim
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.580]  Cook instead of dumping ice on his head? Shouldn't he give the money? But I said that he gave
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:13.380]  the money. Yeah, I think what most people I think everybody who cares enough to actually
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:16.860]  make a video and dump the ice water on their head is also right giving money.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:21.340]  And then I had tweeted last Friday or something like, why is no one dumping money on their
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:32.500]  head? And then finally, of all people, what's his name, dumped some money on his head. Charlie
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:41.660]  Sheen. So you know, I guess I could dump money on my head, but I don't really have that much
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:47.420]  money. We're gonna get 100 singles. Does anyone know a strip club I can go to?
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.580]  I'm sure somebody does. I think you could just go to the bank, though.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:57.300]  Okay, well, now I'm sharing too much. Yeah, I think that's all I have here to discuss
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:05.300]  a bucket of ice ice, ice water singles. Yeah. Oh, no one's done that. Well, money. Yeah,
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:13.660]  that money. All right. Well, thank you, Joanna. Everybody can can follow you on Twitter at
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:20.940]  at Joanna stern. And, and everybody can read your weekly columns and watch your excellent,
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:26.580]  excellent videos at the Wall Street Journal. Thank you. Yes. Is there a special special
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:34.540]  URL or just like what's the homepage of the wsjd.com? wsjd.com.
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:35.540]  Yeah.
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.180]  Yeah, really, and great work. The videos are my favorite part. I don't know.
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.860]  I'm glad to hear that. Yeah, no, we put a lot of effort into those. So
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:48.740]  yeah, I do think that's weird. You know, I was thinking about that before I cut you short.
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.420]  Before I cut the show. I do think it's weird. And you're you're at the center of it, of
[01:51:53.420 --> 01:52:00.180]  the way that the established publication or not even publication media brands. There's
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:05.820]  this incredible convergence between writing and TV. Yeah, it used to be totally different.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:09.900]  I mean, because your pre prior gig to the Wall Street Journal was ABC, I mean, which
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:16.620]  is, you know, old school TV as you can get right. But the video work, you know, and the
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:22.020]  verge certainly raised the bar on the quality of that. And you were there at the outset,
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.900]  you know, when they started that, but they really raised the bar on the quality of the
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:32.620]  video work that that went along with print or not print, but written stuff that was,
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:36.780]  you know, detailed and as long as it ever was, but there's this incredible convergence
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.140]  going on. And I feel like I'm left behind on that.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:44.740]  Well, you can put video on your site. I could I don't know, I guess I'm making up for it
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:50.680]  with podcasts. Right? Yeah, I mean, you know, and and it's not something I feel like I have
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:54.220]  figured out. And every week, I'm trying to try new things, though. There's, you know,
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:58.580]  obviously restrictions on time and, you know, how long people will watch a video for and
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:02.260]  what kind of things are more visual than what you can put into print. I mean, it's, I don't
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:07.140]  think anyone's really mastered it yet. But it's a fun time to play around with it for
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:11.020]  sure. And they're letting me do some fun stuff. So I'm okay with it.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:15.440]  Well, and the production value is just excellent. I mean, it's doesn't seem like Oh, here's
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:21.660]  newspaper people doing video. It's, you know, top tier this, this could be on any TV broadcast
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:22.660]  quality video.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:28.540]  Yeah, my producer, Drew Evans, who will never listen to this, because he will, maybe he
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.540]  will, maybe we'll get him to listen to this. I'm trying to get him on Twitter. But he's,
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:35.180]  he's amazing. He's, he's really, really good. He's

[01:53:54.740 --> 01:54:00.980]  it's, it's fun to be able to have a producer and the producer with skills that can actually
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:07.000]  kind of just make certain things happen, which is really cool, too. Yeah, so well, keep up

[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:36.940]  to the Apple event. But if I am invited, you know, maybe I'll have to turn it down if there's
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.860]  a blackberry event that day. Yeah, that would be that would be just like blackberry to schedule
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:48.860]  it on the same day. Oh, totally, totally.
