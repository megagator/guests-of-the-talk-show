[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  We don't have anything to talk about.
[00:01.480 --> 00:02.480]  We don't.
[00:02.480 --> 00:03.480]  Nothing to talk about.
[00:03.480 --> 00:06.480]  I am on here slowly for self-promotion because I want to tell people that Exponent started
[00:06.480 --> 00:07.480]  again.
[00:07.480 --> 00:08.480]  What's the URL?
[00:08.480 --> 00:09.480]  Exponent.fm?
[00:09.480 --> 00:10.480]  Yeah.
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.480]  But I hate it.
[00:11.480 --> 00:15.480]  Why not just leave it in your podcast?
[00:15.480 --> 00:18.680]  But no, people like to read it, so now I have to tell people.
[00:18.680 --> 00:23.720]  Oh my God, where do we start?
[00:23.720 --> 00:27.440]  We can't screw around, I don't think, can we?
[00:27.440 --> 00:29.040]  There's always room for screwing around.
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.400]  It's been eight months because you can tell on Skype because it says the last time you
[00:32.400 --> 00:34.720]  called someone on Skype and it was eight months ago.
[00:34.720 --> 00:37.560]  Wow, that is a long time.
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.920]  That's unusually long, especially for someone who tends to have the same people over and
[00:42.920 --> 00:43.920]  over again on the show.
[00:43.920 --> 00:47.280]  I've lost my title to Moltz pretty significantly at this point.
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.840]  Well, Moltz had the back-to-backer.
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.760]  It's tough to come back with that.
[00:50.760 --> 00:53.760]  It was the Moltziest.
[00:53.760 --> 00:56.960]  I talked about that on the show, right?
[00:56.960 --> 00:58.660]  I don't remember.
[00:58.660 --> 01:01.840]  I was like, I haven't had Moltz on forever, I'll have Moltz on and then the next week
[01:01.840 --> 01:08.280]  it was like an emergency, like I need to do a show and one, two, three, four people after
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.080]  another couldn't do it when I could do it and then I had to hit the Moltz button even
[01:13.080 --> 01:15.280]  though he had just been on.
[01:15.280 --> 01:18.240]  Made for a good show, good old Moltz.
[01:18.240 --> 01:21.120]  Who do you like in the NFL?
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.120]  I don't know.
[01:22.120 --> 01:27.200]  I'm probably the chief, I guess, just because I think Andy Reid is a great coach and I'd
[01:27.200 --> 01:34.080]  love to see him sort of win but it's hard to follow the NFL in general because the time
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.280]  zone issue and then also like the general feelings of guilt but also the Packers were
[01:40.280 --> 01:44.240]  bad this year so that makes it a lot easier to not pay attention.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.240]  What the hell happened there?
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.440]  Now they fired their coach halfway through the season which is unusual in the NFL and
[01:49.440 --> 01:55.640]  particularly unusual for a well-run organization and the Packers are, you know, their success
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.280]  shows that, I mean, they've widely considered a well-run organization.
[01:59.280 --> 02:02.520]  You know, like if the Jets fired a coach halfway through the year, who in the hell would be
[02:02.520 --> 02:03.520]  surprised?
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.200]  Yeah, I think, well, I think in part that was being a well-run organization.
[02:07.200 --> 02:10.760]  Like if you know he's not coming back, like why leave him dangling out on a vine?
[02:10.760 --> 02:15.080]  I mean, it was pretty apparent to everyone that it was time for that era to end.
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.120]  I think some of us probably felt that era should have ended several years ago and if
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.240]  management has come that decision, then why not let him go, get a head start on the coaching
[02:23.240 --> 02:25.800]  search and, you know, don't leave him dangling out on a vine.
[02:25.800 --> 02:30.220]  Actually, if anything, and give him an opportunity to look for a new job as well.
[02:30.220 --> 02:32.920]  So I don't see any problem with the fire in the middle of the season.
[02:32.920 --> 02:34.600]  If you're going to move on, like move on.
[02:34.600 --> 02:37.520]  Especially if you know your season's over in the NFL.
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.520]  Yeah.
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.440]  Who the hell would have thought two years ago, I think it was two years ago, it seems
[02:42.440 --> 02:47.980]  like yesterday, two years ago when my beloved Dallas Cowboys were playing your Packers in
[02:47.980 --> 02:56.160]  a playoff game and the Cowboys lost through coaching mismanagement.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.680]  There's no other way to describe it.
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.600]  I mean, managing the clock is the most important game time thing that a coach can do, I think.
[03:04.600 --> 03:07.640]  Combination of coach and quarterback, but the coach, it's on the coach.
[03:07.640 --> 03:08.640]  Speaking of Andy Reid.
[03:08.640 --> 03:09.640]  Right.
[03:09.640 --> 03:10.640]  Exactly.
[03:10.640 --> 03:12.800]  Clearly, a coaching error.
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.840]  I'm not going to say that the Cowboys would have won, but I think it was extraordinarily
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.560]  likely that just by managing the clock properly, they would have won.
[03:22.560 --> 03:26.960]  Everybody expected, I mean, who the hell didn't expect Carrot to be fired immediately?
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.040]  I really thought that he, you know, his goose was cooked and here we are two years later
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.520]  and Jason Garrett's still coaching the Dallas Cowboys and Mike Murphy's out.
[03:36.520 --> 03:40.000]  I know Mike Murphy is the president of the Packers.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.400]  So I was, you know, Packers famously don't have an owner.
[03:42.400 --> 03:43.600]  Well, they do have an owner.
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.760]  I am one of the owners and the, along with half the state of Wisconsin, but the, so there's
[03:48.760 --> 03:50.440]  a team president that makes these decisions.
[03:50.440 --> 03:51.800]  So, which is good and bad.
[03:51.800 --> 03:54.880]  I mean, the good thing is obviously there's lots of downsides that come to an owner.
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.080]  You know, there's, the Packers will never move.
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.280]  Like if they, if the team were ever not in Green Bay, it would have to be disbanded and
[04:02.280 --> 04:06.520]  like the proceeds would go to like the local American Legion or something like that.
[04:06.520 --> 04:08.880]  So it's, it's all, that's all very cool.
[04:08.880 --> 04:12.800]  But kind of the problem is that you don't have an owner sort of banging on the door
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.160]  saying, why are we, you know, we have when the all time great quarterbacks, why are we
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.160]  not winning more Superbowls?
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.320]  And I think that's been a bit to the Packers detriment over the last few years.
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.640]  So Mark Murphy has been in that role.
[04:23.640 --> 04:25.280]  So he's the one that's hiring the new coach.
[04:25.280 --> 04:29.880]  They hired a guy named Matt Lefour who was previously the offensive coordinator of the
[04:29.880 --> 04:31.920]  Tennessee Titans, which doesn't seem like much.
[04:31.920 --> 04:35.480]  They out of, but they had a lot of injuries and I think they're, they're, there's a stat
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.200]  like they're expected yardage on like past plays was super high.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.920]  They just didn't have very good players.
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.920]  And then he was previously the offensive coordinator with Sean McVeigh in LA and Kyle Shanahan
[04:46.920 --> 04:47.920]  before that.
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.440]  So he's got a really, really great sort of background.
[04:50.440 --> 04:51.600]  I'm pretty excited about the hire.
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.360]  I really wanted them to do, go with a sort of young guy, but you know, everyone wants
[04:55.360 --> 04:58.440]  to do with the young guy thing after how successful McVeigh has been.
[04:58.440 --> 05:03.100]  And I think of the sort of options there, I think I really liked the pick personally.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.640]  So I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited about it.
[05:04.640 --> 05:05.640]  All right.
[05:05.640 --> 05:06.640]  That's enough football talk.
[05:06.640 --> 05:10.880]  We don't want to, yeah, especially as football has definitely moved into like,
[05:10.880 --> 05:16.120]  a solid number three for me, the, I am all in on basketball, as you know, and the Bucks
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.360]  are amazing and absolutely have a title shot this year.
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.160]  And then last year's Bruges run was awesome, which I don't think we ever talked about,
[05:23.160 --> 05:25.280]  but a great, great run.
[05:25.280 --> 05:33.360]  They added, they added, the name's now escaping me, the, the, the Dodgers catcher grand hall,
[05:33.360 --> 05:35.000]  which is a great signing.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.040]  So yeah, I think things are Milwaukee sports are looking pretty solid.
[05:38.040 --> 05:39.040]  Yeah.
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.680]  Cause that's a good example of a power of coaching really.
[05:42.680 --> 05:47.160]  I mean, it's, oh man, it's fundamentally not that, not a different team, but with a
[05:47.160 --> 05:54.520]  completely different strategy and unbelievably different results.
[05:54.520 --> 05:58.880]  It's been such a tremendously delightful season in part, you know, first and foremost, cause
[05:58.880 --> 06:01.500]  the team's good and it's fun to cheer for a good team.
[06:01.500 --> 06:05.520]  And particularly last year, it was so miserable because you, you wanted to cheer for the team
[06:05.520 --> 06:09.800]  to win, but every win felt like that would make the coach stay longer with that.
[06:09.800 --> 06:10.800]  You clearly needed a change.
[06:10.800 --> 06:13.540]  That's a very miserable place to be as a sports fan.
[06:13.540 --> 06:17.080]  But the other great thing about this year then is they're super successful and also
[06:17.080 --> 06:24.320]  just tremendous heaps of, I told you so, which is, which is, you know, definitely a, a, a
[06:24.320 --> 06:26.840]  probably evil pleasure, but an enjoyable one.
[06:26.840 --> 06:29.760]  And I know that the sports stuff often, you know, there's a lot of you out there who were
[06:29.760 --> 06:33.640]  rolling your eyes cause you're not into sports, but, but I do think that for the talk shows
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.680]  audience of, you know, let's face it, nerds, I do think that there's a fascinating trend
[06:38.680 --> 06:46.440]  in your, in my lifetime in pro sports, which is the rise of analytics and sort of the,
[06:46.440 --> 06:53.400]  the downfall of old school, go with your gut sports, man, you know, manage, you know, picking
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.020]  players, you know, there used to be like, you know, people would actually pick baseball
[06:57.020 --> 07:00.320]  players based on how they look, you know, swing looks good.
[07:00.320 --> 07:01.320]  Let's sign them.
[07:01.320 --> 07:03.520]  That's how they'd sign kids out of high school.
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.440]  And you know, everything is so driven by data and analytics in sports now, if you want to
[07:08.440 --> 07:12.720]  be successful because it works, you know, and the bucks are just proof of that, you
[07:12.720 --> 07:19.000]  know, and that there was, you introduced me to NBA Twitter and NBA Twitter is truly Twitter
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  at its best.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.560]  All the problems that Twitter has is one, you know, if you're a sports fanatic getting
[07:23.560 --> 07:30.000]  involved in the Twitter circle of your favorite sport or team, it is truly a great way to
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.640]  feed an obsession and bucks. Twitter was a hundred percent convinced that with a coaching
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.480]  change and a shift in strategy, the bucks would be a terrific team.
[07:40.480 --> 07:43.720]  And it's exactly, exactly what happened.
[07:43.720 --> 07:44.720]  It's delightful.
[07:44.720 --> 07:47.920]  It's like the one thing, here's a really interesting point though.
[07:47.920 --> 07:52.280]  And this definitely, if you want to do a real tie into this discussion and the rise of nerds
[07:52.280 --> 07:59.920]  and whatnot, back to the stuff we talk about, I think that a mistake, a lot of, you know,
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.120]  it's weird because if you're in the world where you're like, you're just the blindly
[08:03.120 --> 08:05.720]  in the blind, it's like, we've always done it this way.
[08:05.720 --> 08:09.680]  Obviously having a data driven approach is much better.
[08:09.680 --> 08:15.080]  And so there's been a big sort of return to having that sort of approach, to being very
[08:15.080 --> 08:16.740]  good at using data.
[08:16.740 --> 08:20.400]  But now the problem with sort of using data in your decision making is everyone generally
[08:20.400 --> 08:22.120]  speaking has access to the same data.
[08:22.120 --> 08:25.600]  Now there's folks that have, you know, different and more advanced analytics departments, and
[08:25.600 --> 08:28.680]  it's a real sort of arms race to get better at that.
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.560]  And they're sort of diminishing returns.
[08:30.560 --> 08:34.320]  And I think there's an analogy here to the business world where, you know, once people
[08:34.320 --> 08:38.160]  figured out you should focus on like operational efficiency and using data better along those
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.640]  lines, like this is part of the whole revolution, in part driven by competition with Japan and,
[08:43.640 --> 08:47.280]  you know, supply chain efficiency and all those sorts of things, that there was a huge
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.240]  amount of returns to it, but there's not necessarily sustainable differentiation there.
[08:52.240 --> 08:58.240]  And one thing that I think a lot of analytics people get wrong, and I get, you know, lumped
[08:58.240 --> 09:04.640]  in with as an analytics person on NBA Twitter, even though like I don't, I'm not, I am certainly
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.680]  analytics adjacent to use the exact low term, but I'm not, you know, I don't have my own
[09:08.680 --> 09:11.660]  like massive spreadsheets of players or anything on those lines.
[09:11.660 --> 09:17.560]  But you know, if you look at tech, for example, the analytics movement is in many senses,
[09:17.560 --> 09:21.800]  the speeds and feeds movement, which is the, you know, let's look at how fast something
[09:21.800 --> 09:22.800]  is.
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.460]  Let's look at the processor speed, the amount of memory, et cetera, et cetera.
[09:25.460 --> 09:27.520]  It's very sort of number driven.
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.160]  And I think the great thing about sports, and I think more and more folks are maybe
[09:32.160 --> 09:36.240]  sort of becoming vaguely aware of this, is that there's still lots of pieces that go
[09:36.240 --> 09:39.960]  into building a winning team, particularly in basketball, I think more than any other
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.880]  sport, that are very, very hard to measure, that are very, very hard to sort of put on
[09:43.880 --> 09:45.160]  a spreadsheet.
[09:45.160 --> 09:52.040]  And there are advantages in understanding and pursuing those sorts of things, to use
[09:52.040 --> 09:55.360]  an Apple strategy, just to use the sort of obvious sort of analogy.
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.120]  And that I think is particularly interesting.
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.040]  And so moving towards, I don't think analytics is the end all be all by any means.
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.720]  And it's very interesting and exciting as a sports fan to see that part of the game
[10:07.720 --> 10:10.760]  sort of become more and more important.
[10:10.760 --> 10:11.760]  Yeah.
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.800]  To name one example, I think the Dodgers have a reputation of being incredibly analytics
[10:16.800 --> 10:19.040]  driven in terms of like who's in the lineup.
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.960]  And I think they lost the postseason this year by doing it, you know, that they had
[10:23.960 --> 10:28.040]  guys, they had a bunch of outfielders, like way more than three outfielders who were ready
[10:28.040 --> 10:29.040]  to play.
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.360]  And they would pick who was playing based on who was pitching and based on analytics
[10:33.360 --> 10:37.800]  models and stuff, rather than just do what was smart and say like, hey, how about the
[10:37.800 --> 10:40.880]  guy who had the three hits last night, let him play again.
[10:40.880 --> 10:47.080]  Well, I mean, in baseball, that's particularly a huge sort of debate.
[10:47.080 --> 10:51.120]  And, you know, I'm mixed on that because the Brewers certainly took that approach to
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.240]  the extreme.
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.400]  But then again, we basically had no pitching staff and we made it to the NLTS.
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.000]  But yeah, we didn't make it all the way.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  But it's great though.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.720]  I mean, this is why sports is, sports is so fun.
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.160]  I think, you know, just to, I know there's lots of people that don't care about sports,
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.900]  but it's fun because there's so many angles into conversations about it.
[11:11.900 --> 11:16.360]  And there's all in there and all the conversations reach a resolution, right?
[11:16.360 --> 11:17.820]  Like we can debate left and right.
[11:17.820 --> 11:20.840]  Like Bucks fans like to complain that the Bucks aren't getting any attention, even
[11:20.840 --> 11:23.680]  though they're, statistically speaking, they're by far the best team in the league.
[11:23.680 --> 11:25.560]  Like it's not even close.
[11:25.560 --> 11:28.480]  And as far as like net rating and offense efficiency, defense efficiency, all those
[11:28.480 --> 11:30.400]  sorts of like numbers things.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400]  But you know what?
[11:31.400 --> 11:34.200]  It doesn't matter if they get respect because at the end of the day, there's going to be
[11:34.200 --> 11:37.200]  a playoffs and there's going to be a Eastern Carvers finals championship.
[11:37.200 --> 11:40.800]  There's going to be an NBA championship and we're going to know if they were good or not.
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.040]  And that that's very sort of satisfying in a way that, well, lots of areas are not.
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.840]  Yeah, no, that's so true, you know, that we know who we know who won the Super Bowl last
[11:49.840 --> 11:50.840]  year.
[11:50.840 --> 11:55.480]  You know, there's you can argue about who should have, but we know who did, you know.
[11:55.480 --> 11:56.480]  Yep.
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.480]  Yep.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.480]  All right.
[11:58.480 --> 11:59.480]  We got a big agenda.
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.760]  We really can't screw around too much.
[12:01.760 --> 12:02.760]  I don't know.
[12:02.760 --> 12:03.760]  Did you see my note?
[12:03.760 --> 12:04.760]  I don't know what order you want to talk about these things on.
[12:04.760 --> 12:14.560]  We could go most timely would be probably talking about Apple's quarterly earnings warning that
[12:14.560 --> 12:17.640]  sort of shook the market.
[12:17.640 --> 12:20.400]  I think that makes sense because I do want to talk about the app store stuff, but I think
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.760]  that that's actually an interesting thing to talk about as sort of part two as like
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.120]  what is it's very much in the context of what Apple does now, sort of going forward.
[12:29.120 --> 12:32.560]  But yeah, because the app store stuff, the app store stuff is more evergreen and I feel
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.560]  like it's less tight.
[12:33.560 --> 12:36.120]  I feel like the timely stuff always works better first.
[12:36.120 --> 12:37.440]  Yep.
[12:37.440 --> 12:38.800]  So let's talk about it.
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.280]  Boy, people had to let's boy, the market had a fit.
[12:42.280 --> 12:45.540]  Well, I mean, just justifiably so.
[12:45.540 --> 12:50.440]  I think because I think the thing to appreciate is there's two things, there's multiple things
[12:50.440 --> 12:51.440]  that are going on here.
[12:51.440 --> 12:54.760]  I mean, Apple was flying, it was only last summer that they passed a trillion dollars
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.880]  and they think they got like 1.2 trillion or something like that.
[12:58.880 --> 13:03.480]  And there were two big red flags on the last earnings call.
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.440]  The first thing is that their projection, their forecast was already pretty low.
[13:09.440 --> 13:12.240]  I mean, it was lower than the consensus.
[13:12.240 --> 13:14.840]  So that was sort of red flag number one.
[13:14.840 --> 13:18.440]  And then red flag number two was they said, oh, we're not going to report unit sales anymore,
[13:18.440 --> 13:22.360]  which is like, well, if you you know, that sounds like if you don't report unit sales,
[13:22.360 --> 13:24.160]  if you just were going up, would you say that?
[13:24.160 --> 13:25.640]  Well, maybe not.
[13:25.640 --> 13:31.120]  I think also the the reaction was maybe a little bit out of whack people like, oh, iPhone
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.120]  growth is saturated.
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.240]  But iPhone unit sales have been flat for like two or three years now.
[13:36.240 --> 13:41.560]  So like the the if you actually understood what's going on, it wasn't that iPhones stopped
[13:41.560 --> 13:42.580]  growing.
[13:42.580 --> 13:46.580]  The kind of obvious conclusion was that the iPhone sales were going to start to decline.
[13:46.580 --> 13:51.680]  And so that was the there was already lots of sort of bad news in the air and the stock
[13:51.680 --> 13:52.760]  was already sort of plummeting.
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.000]  I mean, the most of the stock's loss has happened even before this.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.360]  But then this has two parts, which is part one is the revenue is actually way worse than
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.360]  we said.
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.880]  And two, we didn't know like the fact that the you're way better off giving a bad forecast
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.640]  that is accurate than than having to sort of restate your revenue.
[14:12.640 --> 14:14.160]  Like that's way worse than that.
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.640]  That's like the worst possible thing you can do as far as your reporting goes.
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.480]  Yeah, but then a couple other companies had to to Samsung.
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.640]  I think LG, a few others like a week later, issued similar warnings based on similar,
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.680]  you know, similar explanations, you know, slow, slow economy in China, etc, etc.
[14:35.680 --> 14:42.360]  Yeah, I mean, it's a little it's interesting to say, and I think I if I were to rewrite
[14:42.360 --> 14:48.200]  my article that I wrote this past week, even after a few days, because some of these this
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.480]  news came out and also things like car sales are down in China, there's definitely there's
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.400]  definitely a lot of news out of China that the economy is slowing.
[14:57.400 --> 15:00.120]  We knew that even the government reported figures were down.
[15:00.120 --> 15:02.640]  And those are all generally thought to be fake anyway.
[15:02.640 --> 15:05.600]  And so if they're down a little bit, it's probably way worse.
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.560]  And also, just, you know, on the ground, I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt that, you know,
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.880]  the trade war is definitely hurting China much more at this point than it is the U.S.
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.400]  It's it's it's it's hitting pretty hard.
[15:17.400 --> 15:24.280]  And so there's definitely the there's no denying that the the economy is a big factor.
[15:24.280 --> 15:28.960]  That said, Apple is also down much more.
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.760]  You know, the reports that we have on our smartphone share like they're down much more
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.760]  than the market.
[15:33.760 --> 15:36.800]  But like there is it's not just in line with everyone else.
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.880]  Like they're they're worse, I think, in some respects.
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.960]  But at the same time, it's definitely a China thing.
[15:41.960 --> 15:47.200]  I mean, it was amazing when that news came out and you had so many people coming out
[15:47.200 --> 15:48.640]  with this is Apple's problem.
[15:48.640 --> 15:54.120]  And if you back up, actually, you know, I started to checkery in 2013, which was very
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.000]  fortuitous for me because that was the iPhone five cycle.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.400]  And that was when there was a ton of panic apples for the first time.
[16:00.400 --> 16:02.800]  Apple wasn't growing like plus 50 percent.
[16:02.800 --> 16:05.200]  They only grew like 15 percent.
[16:05.200 --> 16:08.440]  And you know, the stock was way down and people like Samsung's ascendant.
[16:08.440 --> 16:11.080]  And it was a great opportunity for me to say, no, this is ridiculous.
[16:11.080 --> 16:15.620]  Actually, Samsung is the one that is more sort of in a tough spot.
[16:15.620 --> 16:19.900]  And but you notice all those same people that wrote all those articles in 2013 were back
[16:19.900 --> 16:25.760]  this year writing all the same articles in 2019 and except except for Samsung.
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.080]  And yeah, well, the articles I saw where instead of Samsung's going to eat their lunch, it
[16:31.080 --> 16:37.760]  was the cheap Chinese phones are going to eat Apple's lunch, you know, and not just
[16:37.760 --> 16:39.760]  in China where it is different.
[16:39.760 --> 16:46.120]  Well, not just it's again, it's it's it's it's kind of frustrating because but I can
[16:46.120 --> 16:49.040]  understand why, you know, we I think we've talked about that.
[16:49.040 --> 16:55.420]  I think Apple's management does not listen enough to sort of criticism, in part because
[16:55.420 --> 16:58.640]  so much of the criticism of Apple is just kind of unhinged.
[16:58.640 --> 17:04.680]  And even in this case, the problem for Apple in China is less cheap Chinese phones.
[17:04.680 --> 17:10.200]  It's things like the Huawei mate, which by the way, it costs $800 or the large one costs
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.200]  like $1,000.
[17:11.200 --> 17:17.100]  Like the issue is not people buying cheap phones instead of buying iPhones.
[17:17.100 --> 17:21.840]  It's people buying other very expensive phones.
[17:21.840 --> 17:27.920]  Yeah, and well, one of the things I didn't really think about with the trade war, but
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.880]  it's very obvious in hindsight, with the US is the, basically, I don't know how to describe
[17:33.880 --> 17:42.480]  it the patriotism issue, where it, you know, you know, the Trump administration is poking
[17:42.480 --> 17:49.040]  a stick at China, and people in China are naturally it's driving a bit more of a, hey,
[17:49.040 --> 17:54.680]  let's buy Chinese phones, you know, let's, you know, and Apple is obviously unique in
[17:54.680 --> 18:00.440]  that very almost unique in that regard, because what other American company sells large amounts
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.200]  of consumer products in China, maybe luxury brands, but a lot of the luxury brands are
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.720]  not US companies, right?
[18:06.720 --> 18:08.120]  Are people buying Fords over there?
[18:08.120 --> 18:09.120]  I doubt it.
[18:09.120 --> 18:11.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[18:11.120 --> 18:12.120]  It's hard.
[18:12.120 --> 18:15.680]  It is a super hard question to answer, like how much that mattered.
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.600]  But I also think it's, I agree with you, it's silly to not think that it didn't matter.
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.080]  And, you know, I've been sort of in the daily update, not in weekly articles.
[18:23.080 --> 18:26.640]  So the only subscribers who know this, but you know, I've been banging the drum that
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.840]  Apple is way from the moment the trade war began that Apple, this is bad for Apple, this
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.600]  is bad for Apple, this is bad for Apple.
[18:33.600 --> 18:35.160]  And it's because they're exposed on both sides.
[18:35.160 --> 18:38.760]  They're exposed on the production side and they're exposed on the consumption side.
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.040]  And the, and given how large the market is, relatively speaking for Apple, and this is
[18:43.040 --> 18:44.280]  the other thing with Samsung, right?
[18:44.280 --> 18:46.720]  Samsung's kind of not in the Chinese market anymore.
[18:46.720 --> 18:49.320]  Like they're, they're number seven or eight or something like that.
[18:49.320 --> 18:52.160]  Like their, their share is so small now.
[18:52.160 --> 18:56.480]  Like, if you want to talk about being obliterated by Chinese brands, I mean, Samsung was obliterated
[18:56.480 --> 18:57.920]  by Chinese brands.
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.640]  The fact that Apple still has 12% share is a testament to the fact that they are still
[19:02.640 --> 19:03.640]  differentiated.
[19:03.640 --> 19:10.320]  I don't have the link handy, but I just remember reading a couple of days ago, reading about
[19:10.320 --> 19:17.840]  Samsung's projected warning for this quarter, the upcoming quarter they're about to report.
[19:17.840 --> 19:23.800]  It actually have those numbers in my head that at one point Samsung had 18% market share
[19:23.800 --> 19:26.320]  in China.
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.800]  And last time that was measured, it was 0.9%, like under 1%.
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.440]  That is, that's staggering.
[19:34.440 --> 19:37.440]  And especially when you consider the scale.
[19:37.440 --> 19:38.440]  Right.
[19:38.440 --> 19:41.100]  Their profit warning was mostly about their component sales, right?
[19:41.100 --> 19:45.600]  Which matters as far as the smartphone market being down, but it was, it wasn't, it was
[19:45.600 --> 19:50.760]  a related warning to Apple, but it was like a different type of warning in that it's not
[19:50.760 --> 19:52.600]  that their smartphone sales are getting slaughtered.
[19:52.600 --> 19:56.300]  It's that there, if less smartphones are being sold in general, they're going to make a lot
[19:56.300 --> 19:57.300]  less money.
[19:57.300 --> 19:58.300]  Yeah.
[19:58.300 --> 20:04.640]  I, and I think that the hit a point that you mentioned a minute or two ago, I, I, it, I
[20:04.640 --> 20:11.160]  think that Apple's exposure in China is, is obviously the single biggest threat facing
[20:11.160 --> 20:12.160]  the company.
[20:12.160 --> 20:16.280]  And I think it's, I think, I don't think there's any, any doubt about it.
[20:16.280 --> 20:23.440]  You know, I don't think, you know, they could lose any, you know, Johnny Ive or Tim Cook
[20:23.440 --> 20:31.020]  or, you know, Phil Schiller could leave, you know, it's, it's not going to, you know, nothing
[20:31.020 --> 20:36.000]  is as big a risk as China, like some kind of calamity, calamitous escalation of this
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  trade war.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.520]  Cause it, like you said, Apple's exposed on both sides there.
[20:39.520 --> 20:44.760]  They mostly, I mean, the most importantly on the production side, like Apple can't make
[20:44.760 --> 20:50.600]  its phone, it can't make the phones for sure anywhere else in the world like, and so something
[20:50.600 --> 20:54.640]  that would make it more difficult to make, to, to produce their products in China could
[20:54.640 --> 20:56.520]  be devastating to Apple in the short run.
[20:56.520 --> 20:57.520]  Yeah.
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.520]  I completely agree.
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.760]  And honestly, you know, if you want to get into criticism of Apple's executives and,
[21:02.760 --> 21:07.080]  you know, there does deserve to be criticism for a miss of this magnitude, even if the
[21:07.080 --> 21:09.000]  market changed dramatically.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.480]  And I think they, you know, we can get into what I wrote a little bit.
[21:12.480 --> 21:16.920]  I think they've, they've generally underestimated their risk in China for reasons we can get
[21:16.920 --> 21:17.920]  into.
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.600]  But just in general, I think Apple, they're a little too cheery on these earnings calls.
[21:23.600 --> 21:26.160]  I think it's been a little bit of a problem for a while, frankly.
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.840]  Like they, they, the fact that China is a huge risk factor, I think they should be upfront
[21:30.840 --> 21:31.840]  about that.
[21:31.840 --> 21:34.560]  Like it, it, it so obviously is.
[21:34.560 --> 21:39.440]  And you know, instead Tim Cook has spent the last several years, which have included quite
[21:39.440 --> 21:43.720]  a few quarters with very bad results in China saying, Oh, we believe in the Chinese market.
[21:43.720 --> 21:46.320]  The Chinese market is super important to us, blah, blah, blah.
[21:46.320 --> 21:47.320]  Yeah.
[21:47.320 --> 21:52.200]  There hasn't been enough in my estimation, sort of a honesty about the fact that look,
[21:52.200 --> 21:54.280]  we're very optimistic about the Chinese market.
[21:54.280 --> 21:57.260]  It's a huge opportunity, but there's a lot of risks there.
[21:57.260 --> 22:01.680]  And we've, as you know, our results have been very up and down and I feel like a little
[22:01.680 --> 22:07.680]  honesty about the China situation over, not just this quarter, but the last few years
[22:07.680 --> 22:12.520]  would have bought them, would have been very beneficial this quarter and, and it would
[22:12.520 --> 22:15.280]  have come as much less a sort of, sort of surprise.
[22:15.280 --> 22:19.560]  I mean, you remember back with the six S cycle, like the Chinese market got clobbered.
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.060]  Like they, they were not selling anything there.
[22:22.060 --> 22:26.120]  And instead of sort of being straightforward about why that was, they're just like, Oh,
[22:26.120 --> 22:27.120]  it's a great market.
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.120]  We have very confidence in them back.
[22:28.120 --> 22:31.160]  And you know, they spent the whole cycle saying, we have a lot of people that are upgraded
[22:31.160 --> 22:32.160]  to.
[22:32.160 --> 22:33.160]  We feel very confident.
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.800]  And then they had to do, do a $2 billion inventory right down.
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.200]  It's like, well, maybe you should have been a little clearer about what was going on all
[22:38.200 --> 22:41.640]  along instead of suddenly changing your tune, which, you know, I was very critical of it
[22:41.640 --> 22:42.640]  at the time.
[22:42.640 --> 22:43.680]  And I couldn't help but think about it now.
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.620]  Like I just feel like there's a little bit too much excessive optimism at times with
[22:48.620 --> 22:51.980]  cook in particular on some of these earnings calls.
[22:51.980 --> 23:00.120]  And I think the fear is my fear is that it's not, you know, that, that the reason behind
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.000]  that isn't dishonesty.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.600]  It is not raw, rawing China, knowing that it's, that it's wrong.
[23:06.600 --> 23:11.320]  It's that he honestly doesn't understand their problems in China.
[23:11.320 --> 23:16.360]  You know, that, you know, that, that he really is wrong, right?
[23:16.360 --> 23:22.760]  That's more worrisome to me than if he's being overly optimistic on earnings calls with a
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.820]  knowing in the back of his head that he's BSing a little, you know, like it, to me,
[23:26.820 --> 23:28.660]  it's more worrisome if he's actually wrong.
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.240]  And I think that's actually more likely.
[23:30.240 --> 23:35.960]  Cause I think Tim Cook is fundamentally a very honest person, almost remarkably.
[23:35.960 --> 23:41.040]  So for somebody who's the CEO of a large company, I mean, that's, and it's certainly not something
[23:41.040 --> 23:50.500]  anybody ever said is Steve Jobs wasn't, yeah, he wasn't a liar per se, but he was a bullshitter
[23:50.500 --> 23:55.480]  extraordinaire and Tim Cook is not, it is, it's just, and it's just the antithesis of
[23:55.480 --> 23:58.400]  his personality.
[23:58.400 --> 24:02.400]  I completely agree that to me, and this was sort of my third, I put like, there's three
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.640]  errors Apple made and one, like I said, I think they've always been more vulnerable
[24:06.640 --> 24:09.080]  in China with particularly with S models.
[24:09.080 --> 24:13.440]  And I think that they probably overestimated the XR model again, but the third error was
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.440]  exactly this.
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.440]  Like there's, I would much rather have a liar than someone that's not fully in touch with
[24:19.440 --> 24:20.440]  reality.
[24:20.440 --> 24:24.520]  I think that that's exactly right.
[24:24.520 --> 24:30.600]  Or as is the case here in the U S we've got, we've got someone in charge who's both, yeah,
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.800]  all of the above, but yeah, me too, me too.
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.600]  I would rather have somebody at the wheel who at least, you know, if, if they're lost,
[24:41.600 --> 24:45.160]  but telling you they're not lost, I'd at least have them know that, that at least themselves
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.440]  that they're lost, you know what I mean, rather than honestly believe they're on the right
[24:49.440 --> 24:50.440]  way.
[24:50.440 --> 24:51.640]  No, this is exactly it.
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.360]  This is really the thing that concerns me the most about this entire episode.
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.600]  And again, just because it's a bit of a pattern.
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.040]  Like we, I remember I wrote about this, the six S cycle, every single earnings call, like
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.160]  the results were way, we're not what anyone expected.
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.680]  And every earnings cycle, Tim Cook would cite, and I literally, I went through and I tracked
[25:08.680 --> 25:12.440]  all of them and I quoted all of them in, in a daily update where every cycle Tim Cook
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.440]  was like, we have a lot of upgrades coming along.
[25:14.440 --> 25:15.440]  We feel very confident.
[25:15.440 --> 25:18.200]  We have only 30% of the base is upgraded only whatever.
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.120]  Cause every, every call he'd be asked, do you think that this, the six, the large phone
[25:23.120 --> 25:26.640]  pulled forward people, you know, that made them upgrade faster than they would have otherwise.
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.480]  And that's why the success is going to be hurt.
[25:28.480 --> 25:30.600]  And every time it's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:30.600 --> 25:33.580]  And then at the end of the year, he's like, you know, what we think happened was all the
[25:33.580 --> 25:35.200]  upgrades got pulled forward.
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.760]  And so that is why the success was down.
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.080]  It's like, well, why did you know, that's been clear to everyone for a while.
[25:41.080 --> 25:43.180]  You've been denying it over and over again.
[25:43.180 --> 25:45.700]  Why didn't you just admit that was the case all along?
[25:45.700 --> 25:50.600]  And I think that he actually thought that there was a new reality and that the six growth
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.020]  would continue going forward.
[25:52.020 --> 25:54.900]  And actually there wasn't necessarily a new reality.
[25:54.900 --> 26:02.140]  And so that just reflecting on that, and it makes me concerned that there's a tendency
[26:02.140 --> 26:06.760]  in Apple's management to always see sort of the sunny side of the egg as it were.
[26:06.760 --> 26:09.440]  And that's, it's good to be optimistic.
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.900]  It's good to pump up the troops, but it's really important to have a sort of clear-eyed
[26:13.900 --> 26:18.440]  view about exactly what the state of your business is.
[26:18.440 --> 26:22.300]  And if you don't, that's a really good way to get yourself in trouble.
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.300]  Yeah.
[26:23.300 --> 26:29.280]  Now, in my family, we have a longstanding tradition where we call them being right points
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.540]  and they're just like invisible coins that you pantomime giving to somebody.
[26:32.540 --> 26:36.460]  If there was any kind of argument over, you know, it could be anything small or large.
[26:36.460 --> 26:41.820]  This is the most, this is the most unsurprising news ever, but continue.
[26:41.820 --> 26:43.740]  Jonas's was, we invented them in Joe.
[26:43.740 --> 26:44.860]  We didn't have them before Jonas.
[26:44.860 --> 26:47.860]  It was something we invented with, with Jonas, but we call them being right points.
[26:47.860 --> 26:52.180]  And the way you admit somebody was right and you were wrong is you award them a being right
[26:52.180 --> 26:53.900]  point.
[26:53.900 --> 27:03.100]  And I'm awarding you a being right point for your, your overall thesis on S model iPhones
[27:03.100 --> 27:11.300]  and the Chinese market which I, why don't I let you paraphrase or explain it for those
[27:11.300 --> 27:16.460]  who aren't familiar with it because I think it's really, really interesting.
[27:16.460 --> 27:20.860]  And I think it's, I, I, you know, can't prove that it's what's happening this year, but
[27:20.860 --> 27:25.580]  it's certainly the, their, their bad years in China certainly line up with S years for
[27:25.580 --> 27:26.580]  the iPhone.
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.580]  Yeah.
[27:27.580 --> 27:33.920]  So it is a subtle point because it's not to say that the, the, I, so a podcast is actually
[27:33.920 --> 27:35.460]  a good way to explain it.
[27:35.460 --> 27:43.940]  My thesis is that Apple's differentiation in China is different and fundamentally weaker
[27:43.940 --> 27:46.220]  than it is elsewhere in the world.
[27:46.220 --> 27:49.580]  And that is due, I focus primarily on WeChat, but it's not just WeChat.
[27:49.580 --> 27:54.500]  It's sort of the broad array of services in China and keeping in mind that Android in
[27:54.500 --> 27:59.340]  China is a very different experience than Android here because here Android is, it's
[27:59.340 --> 28:03.020]  Google Android, whereas Android in China, it's all homegrown Android.
[28:03.020 --> 28:04.700]  It's, it's based on the open source project.
[28:04.700 --> 28:06.060]  It's not involved Google at all.
[28:06.060 --> 28:08.740]  It's heavily tuned to sort of the local market.
[28:08.740 --> 28:14.420]  And the long and short of it is, is that the sort of step down in the user experience,
[28:14.420 --> 28:19.380]  if that's, if you believe there is a step down between iOS and Android is much fainter
[28:19.380 --> 28:24.460]  in China in part because the most important things to your life are going with you.
[28:24.460 --> 28:29.420]  And again, WeChat is not just chat, it's not just messaging, it's, it's, it's payments
[28:29.420 --> 28:31.640]  like all aspects of life.
[28:31.640 --> 28:35.500]  Like there's always stories in China about how old people like go out and they can't
[28:35.500 --> 28:37.860]  buy anything because they're not used to buying with their phone and they feel very
[28:37.860 --> 28:40.060]  put out because no one will accept cash anymore.
[28:40.060 --> 28:43.980]  Like the degree to which, you know, the WeChat wallet, the Alibaba wallet are dominant is,
[28:43.980 --> 28:45.380]  is hard to overstate.
[28:45.380 --> 28:49.060]  There's, there's many apps, there's the fact that you pay your bills using WeChat,
[28:49.060 --> 28:51.980]  you contact government agencies, WeChat, WeChat is LinkedIn.
[28:51.980 --> 28:54.140]  All your business contacts are there.
[28:54.140 --> 29:01.500]  Like the degree in which it is interwoven in all aspects of life are hard to overstate.
[29:01.500 --> 29:04.700]  And what that means is one, you switch to Android, obviously it also has WeChat, not
[29:04.700 --> 29:09.780]  just that, things like WeChat and other Chinese services are arguably better because they're
[29:09.780 --> 29:15.140]  not locked down the way that Apple locks down iOS where, you know, yes, there is the affordances
[29:15.140 --> 29:18.960]  to share between the apps along those lines, but they're very, you know, you can't get
[29:18.960 --> 29:24.460]  the deep well of integration that you can if you're sort of architecting the, the OS
[29:24.460 --> 29:28.380]  from scratch for the local market in the way that those local phones are.
[29:28.380 --> 29:32.860]  And so the reason you buy an iPhone in China is not necessarily because your day to day
[29:32.860 --> 29:35.460]  experience of using the device is better.
[29:35.460 --> 29:41.180]  It in some respects is, is arguably worse, but you buy it because China is a very sort
[29:41.180 --> 29:47.020]  of, you want to show off your, you want to show off that you have the new iPhone.
[29:47.020 --> 29:51.680]  It's a very, the way that wealth is sort of flaunted in China, it's pretty crazy if you
[29:51.680 --> 29:52.680]  haven't been there.
[29:52.680 --> 29:55.780]  Like it's, it's very jarring, especially, you know, I grew up in the Midwest and the
[29:55.780 --> 30:01.420]  idea of, you know, showing off that your, your fancy handbag or, or being a very visible
[30:01.420 --> 30:04.620]  about your, your wealth is so foreign to me like that.
[30:04.620 --> 30:09.920]  I mean, it's so strange to me and it's just so it's very, very different.
[30:09.920 --> 30:14.220]  And so you have an iPhone and iPhone has always been the top of the line.
[30:14.220 --> 30:16.940]  Like it's very clearly the best thing, the best bottle.
[30:16.940 --> 30:21.020]  The fact that it's expensive is a good thing and not a bad thing.
[30:21.020 --> 30:23.560]  You know, this was something that people miss when the five C were out.
[30:23.560 --> 30:27.020]  The five C's like, Oh, you know, one month salary in China.
[30:27.020 --> 30:31.300]  People who are, people who are earning that much in China are not buying iPhones, right?
[30:31.300 --> 30:36.420]  There's there, you can't look at a billion person market and, and look at averages.
[30:36.420 --> 30:38.540]  You have to look at the different segments in the market.
[30:38.540 --> 30:43.580]  And there's a very large segment that absolutely has the income to buy an iPhone and would.
[30:43.580 --> 30:50.340]  And the flip side of that though, is that if an iPhone isn't new, then what's sort of
[30:50.340 --> 30:51.340]  the allure.
[30:51.340 --> 30:56.860]  If I go out and I buy a 10 S yes, there may, there are some degree of, of, of iPhone fans
[30:56.860 --> 31:01.300]  and people that generally prefer iOS that want the newest model.
[31:01.300 --> 31:07.420]  But I think that that segment is much smaller than people that, that care very about the
[31:07.420 --> 31:09.740]  visibility of the phone that they're carrying.
[31:09.740 --> 31:13.380]  And so if you're someone that buys every year, well better off to buy, like I said, the new
[31:13.380 --> 31:17.220]  Huawei Mate or the Mate 10 like that, cause that's clearly the new phone.
[31:17.220 --> 31:19.940]  It's the new hot hotness and you can show off that you have it.
[31:19.940 --> 31:23.860]  And if you're not, if you want to stick with iOS, well just stick with the iPhone 10.
[31:23.860 --> 31:28.580]  Like no one knows it's not the iPhone 10 S it's, you know, you might as well have the
[31:28.580 --> 31:29.580]  newest phone.
[31:29.580 --> 31:37.180]  And this, again, I'm not saying this is a V factor, but what it results in is a market
[31:37.180 --> 31:42.240]  where Apple's mote in my estimation is far shallower than it is almost anywhere else
[31:42.240 --> 31:43.360]  in the world.
[31:43.360 --> 31:46.340]  And what that means is when other things come along.
[31:46.340 --> 31:50.220]  So I think they would be weak regardless because I predicted that the S models are going to
[31:50.220 --> 31:51.540]  always be weak in China.
[31:51.540 --> 31:57.180]  But you add on economic troubles, you add on a slowing economy, you add on the nationalistic
[31:57.180 --> 32:01.360]  sentiment because of the trade war, you add on, you know, the Huawei CFO being arrested
[32:01.360 --> 32:03.880]  and people maybe want to react against that.
[32:03.880 --> 32:09.840]  And Apple doesn't really have anything propping it up the way it might in a different market.
[32:09.840 --> 32:12.140]  And so I wouldn't say I appreciate the right point.
[32:12.140 --> 32:17.620]  I don't think that is the only factor, but I think it's a factor that is a factor and
[32:17.620 --> 32:22.300]  it's a factor that that interacts with all the other factors to make those other factors
[32:22.300 --> 32:24.260]  even worse, if that makes sense.
[32:24.260 --> 32:29.980]  Well, and I think it might be a factor that Apple's senior management either it is in
[32:29.980 --> 32:36.260]  denial about or isn't doesn't grasp as fully as they should, perhaps, you know, I do think
[32:36.260 --> 32:37.260]  that's the case.
[32:37.260 --> 32:39.400]  And that ties into sort of the excessive optimism case.
[32:39.400 --> 32:47.120]  Like the there's I mean, I wrote this in, you know, a year and a half ago in the middle
[32:47.120 --> 32:49.580]  of sort of the S cycle or the seven cycle.
[32:49.580 --> 32:55.860]  And really looking at the China numbers, what was so striking was Apple was flat.
[32:55.860 --> 32:59.740]  But if you and I did this and that in that article, the Apple's China problem, if you
[32:59.740 --> 33:04.880]  took out China, the entire business was up like 10 percent or 10, 15 percent like the
[33:04.880 --> 33:10.100]  iPhone was doing great and the iPhone was doing great everywhere except for China.
[33:10.100 --> 33:13.340]  Once you put in China, then the overall numbers were flat.
[33:13.340 --> 33:15.940]  But but once you took out China, it was up.
[33:15.940 --> 33:21.160]  And there was clearly the China market was behaving differently and it was behaving differently
[33:21.160 --> 33:23.120]  again in a sort of predictable way.
[33:23.120 --> 33:27.460]  And so the prediction that I made at the time was that actually I said Apple has a China
[33:27.460 --> 33:28.680]  problem.
[33:28.680 --> 33:32.940]  But the implication of that China problem is that the next iPhone is going to return
[33:32.940 --> 33:36.940]  Apple to growth in China because it's going to be a new form factor.
[33:36.940 --> 33:37.980]  And that's exactly what happened.
[33:37.980 --> 33:39.660]  The iPhone 10 was a great success in China.
[33:39.660 --> 33:41.500]  Apple started growing in China again.
[33:41.500 --> 33:44.900]  And then you had, you know, Apple's management already call saying, oh, yeah, everything's
[33:44.900 --> 33:45.900]  great.
[33:45.900 --> 33:46.900]  So he told you China's great.
[33:46.900 --> 33:51.580]  But but there was a part two to that prediction, which was the next S model.
[33:51.580 --> 33:52.780]  They're going to be in big trouble.
[33:52.780 --> 33:54.460]  And that's, again, exactly what happened.
[33:54.460 --> 33:56.500]  Now, I can't again.
[33:56.500 --> 33:59.900]  It's all tied into the economic factors, not denying those factors at all.
[33:59.900 --> 34:04.060]  But I think that it is a factor and I agree with you that I don't think it's one that
[34:04.060 --> 34:07.860]  Apple's management has has has taken completely seriously.
[34:07.860 --> 34:09.060]  Yeah.
[34:09.060 --> 34:12.980]  And, you know, predicting these things is hard.
[34:12.980 --> 34:15.940]  I've spoken to people at Apple.
[34:15.940 --> 34:20.020]  And I remember we had a conversation when the 5C came out.
[34:20.020 --> 34:24.900]  And one of the things about that made the 5C very different than any previous phone
[34:24.900 --> 34:29.100]  until the 10 are really is is the variety of colors.
[34:29.100 --> 34:32.100]  You know, that there were five colors to choose from.
[34:32.100 --> 34:35.620]  And one of my questions was, you know, how do you how do you, you know, what do you do
[34:35.620 --> 34:40.640]  just make them all like in the same quantities and and and adjust after you see which ones
[34:40.640 --> 34:41.640]  are popular?
[34:41.640 --> 34:44.580]  I mean, like, you know, how do you gauge something like that?
[34:44.580 --> 34:50.660]  And they're like, you know, you know, as usual, they didn't explain exactly what number I
[34:50.660 --> 34:53.440]  was trying to get them say, oh, we made a lot of the blue one, right.
[34:53.440 --> 34:58.340]  But they, of course, revealed nothing of the sort, but did say that they're always surprised
[34:58.340 --> 35:03.980]  every year, and especially with the iPhone in particular, because it is the most popular
[35:03.980 --> 35:11.260]  and therefore, it reaches the most people there that they're surprised every year with
[35:11.260 --> 35:16.660]  differences that they never anticipated, like, you know, there's two colors of the iPhone
[35:16.660 --> 35:23.440]  4S, and they open up a new carrier and Country X doesn't even matter what country it is.
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.660]  And the in that country, everybody buys the white one, and they had no idea they had no
[35:27.660 --> 35:31.900]  idea that black wouldn't be popular there, but, you know, and, and they said, you know,
[35:31.900 --> 35:34.800]  we adjust on the fly, you know, that's, that's what we do.
[35:34.800 --> 35:39.380]  But there is so it's really, you know, even Apple, you know, they don't think that they
[35:39.380 --> 35:43.820]  can foresee everything, but boy, they're, they're, their estimates for years have been
[35:43.820 --> 35:44.820]  close.
[35:44.820 --> 35:50.180]  I mean, one of the points I because this is something that I tracked for a while is Apple's
[35:50.180 --> 35:53.180]  estimates used to be eerie, eerily accurate, right?
[35:53.180 --> 35:56.340]  Even if you like, even when they were sort of sandbagging, they were sandbagging very
[35:56.340 --> 36:01.860]  predictably. And yes, very predictable, right? But here's what's interesting. They were way
[36:01.860 --> 36:06.380]  off on the iPhone six, right on the downside, like they missed, they missed the upside,
[36:06.380 --> 36:10.540]  then they were way off on the success where they wait, they over predicted, they were
[36:10.540 --> 36:15.940]  a little better on the seven, and the 10. But actually, they were under on the 10, too.
[36:15.940 --> 36:21.100]  And I think what's interesting is they so basically, since the iPhone six, their estimates
[36:21.100 --> 36:27.300]  have been significantly less accurate. And, and, and I think that's actually not surprising,
[36:27.300 --> 36:31.180]  because there's another thing that's going on here, which is, for the first, you know,
[36:31.180 --> 36:36.220]  10 years of the iPhone, or eight, nine years of the iPhone, Apple was still rolling out
[36:36.220 --> 36:40.580]  availability, right? They were adding countries, they were adding carriers. And what Apple
[36:40.580 --> 36:44.020]  would add a carrier, particularly once they were very powerful, after sort of the first
[36:44.020 --> 36:48.300]  four or five years, they would add carriers, and they would, the carriers had to agree
[36:48.300 --> 36:53.780]  to guaranteed sales. So like they had to say, we will absolutely sell this many iPhones
[36:53.780 --> 36:58.020]  in the, you know, in the next year or something along those lines. And if we don't make it,
[36:58.020 --> 37:03.540]  we're gonna pay for them anyway. And I think what might have been going on here was Apple's
[37:03.540 --> 37:08.380]  estimates were so accurate, because a lot of their growth was driven by the expansion
[37:08.380 --> 37:12.740]  of these deals, which had numbers written into them. So they kind of knew exactly how
[37:12.740 --> 37:17.020]  much was going on. And whereas what was, you know, the other thing with the iPhone six
[37:17.020 --> 37:20.620]  that made it so huge was that was the first iPhone to launch with China Mobile on board,
[37:20.620 --> 37:25.900]  because China Mobile came on during the five, the five s cycle. And, and that was the first
[37:25.900 --> 37:29.980]  one to launch China Mobile. And since then, they haven't really that was the last kind
[37:29.980 --> 37:34.940]  of the Great White Whale for Apple as far as carrier availability. Since then, they've
[37:34.940 --> 37:40.740]  added them here and there. But that aspect of iPhone growth is kind of over. And now
[37:40.740 --> 37:44.140]  the prediction is actually real predictions, like how many people are gonna buy them as
[37:44.140 --> 37:47.460]  opposed to how many carriers are gonna force to buy them contractually. And I think it's
[37:47.460 --> 37:52.540]  not a surprise that ever since then, their predictions, their forecasts have been significantly
[37:52.540 --> 37:55.860]  less accurate than they were before then.
[37:55.860 --> 38:01.820]  I linked to it this week. Matt Richmond had a blog post years ago, it was while it was
[38:01.820 --> 38:05.660]  still going on. But the way he I think this was obvious, if you looked at the charts,
[38:05.660 --> 38:08.980]  you know, you can look at the see the slope of iSales, iPhone sales growth in the early
[38:08.980 --> 38:14.380]  years, and you could see at whatever unbelievable slope it was. But when you word it the way
[38:14.380 --> 38:19.980]  he did, it's truly extraordinary that that the iPhone three g sold more than the original
[38:19.980 --> 38:24.620]  iPhone, the three g s sold more than the three g and the original iPhone combined the iPhone
[38:24.620 --> 38:30.420]  four sold more than the previous three or I guess it's we're going by calendar years
[38:30.420 --> 38:34.060]  like, but that iPhone four year, they sold more iPhone than the previous three years
[38:34.060 --> 38:38.380]  combined. And then the iPhone four s, they sold more than the previous four years combined,
[38:38.380 --> 38:41.620]  like, every year wasn't just bigger than the previous year, it was bigger than all
[38:41.620 --> 38:48.020]  previous years combined, that type of thing, that type of growth, it, it, it's hard to
[38:48.020 --> 38:51.700]  imagine how that could happen in any other market than phones, because the way that that
[38:51.700 --> 39:00.060]  can happen is the way that you roll out to additional markets around the world, new carriers.
[39:00.060 --> 39:04.300]  It's truly remarkable, you know, and even within the US, it's not even just countries,
[39:04.300 --> 39:07.540]  you know, like other countries, I think I've always made it a little bit easier, there
[39:07.540 --> 39:14.100]  was less lock in to carriers. But, you know, like it opening going from AT&T exclusive
[39:14.100 --> 39:20.860]  to adding Verizon in 2011 was like adding another United States. Yeah, that's it. You
[39:20.860 --> 39:25.780]  just can't, you can't keep that up. I mean, and I know that there are two versions of
[39:25.780 --> 39:30.740]  the quote, law of large numbers. And the people who only know about the I forget what the
[39:30.740 --> 39:38.460]  first one is, the one is more mathematically rigorous. But the the sort of business e one
[39:38.460 --> 39:43.060]  is is sort of basically explaining why Ponzi schemes can't work, right? Because you run
[39:43.060 --> 39:47.060]  out of people, right? You know, you can't can't keep a Ponzi scheme going, because eventually
[39:47.060 --> 39:50.920]  you run out of the only it only works by bringing new people into the scheme. And eventually
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.700]  you run out of new people to bring in. I'm not saying that the iPhone is a Ponzi scheme.
[39:55.700 --> 40:01.500]  It's the opposite. It was a totally legitimate product. But the growth was driven by bringing
[40:01.500 --> 40:06.620]  in new markets, and new markets had new people who'd never been able to buy a new iPhone before.
[40:06.620 --> 40:10.300]  And eventually you run out of new markets. Yep. And there's kind of like, there's three
[40:10.300 --> 40:15.180]  ways to grow business, right? Like you can serve a market, you can grow, which is, you
[40:15.180 --> 40:19.020]  know, there's an empty pie pan, and you want to fill the pie pan, you can grow the market,
[40:19.020 --> 40:23.100]  which is you get a bigger pie, or you can still share from other people sort of in that
[40:23.100 --> 40:28.620]  market, which means, you know, you you take a bigger slice. And, you know, Apple, for
[40:28.620 --> 40:32.620]  what you're talking about, they were all in the sort of filling the market stage to start
[40:32.620 --> 40:36.100]  where people that already had phones, now they're getting smartphones, and then they
[40:36.100 --> 40:40.060]  grew the market, which is a lot of people that never had phones now had a smartphone.
[40:40.060 --> 40:44.460]  But but now that all those are sort of tapped out, and to the extent that you can grow the
[40:44.460 --> 40:48.500]  market, it's definitely in markets that where the iPhone is way too expensive. And, you
[40:48.500 --> 40:53.780]  know, like one, I think, under discussed market is India, where Apple is just a total mess.
[40:53.780 --> 40:59.940]  I mean, they've actually completely flatlined in sales there too. And, and then, so they're
[40:59.940 --> 41:04.540]  basically stuck with stealing share, which, you know, again, which I think is not the
[41:04.540 --> 41:10.260]  worst place to be. It's still the case that, again, outside of China, that more people
[41:10.260 --> 41:15.320]  go from Android iOS than the other direction. So they're, they're, they're in strong shape
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.700]  in the long run. But it's a, you know, you know, it's a much harder and slower path to
[41:20.700 --> 41:22.200]  growth than the other ones.
[41:22.200 --> 41:26.660]  I think one of the great ironies of Apple's situation in China, and I think it's permanent.
[41:26.660 --> 41:31.180]  I think I think it's exactly what, what, you know, you've been describing what you're being
[41:31.180 --> 41:36.700]  right point was awarded for is that it goes back to what you said half an hour ago, though,
[41:36.700 --> 41:42.420]  that Apple has long been misunderstood by financial pundits, and tech pundits for basically
[41:42.420 --> 41:48.900]  the same reason, which is that I think most financial and tech pundits want to treat Apple
[41:48.900 --> 41:53.680]  as just another company that makes X, Y, and Z. They're just another laptop maker. They're
[41:53.680 --> 41:59.540]  just another phone handset maker, and that they're competing on an equal basis. And that
[41:59.540 --> 42:07.500]  the, you know, and the advice to the company over the years has been so fundamentally wrong
[42:07.500 --> 42:11.940]  based on that misunderstanding. And I, you know, I think it leads to people who do understand
[42:11.940 --> 42:17.160]  Apple rolling their eyes, including Apple management, you know, but I think the irony
[42:17.160 --> 42:23.980]  here is that, you know, I think the truth is around the world, Apple strength is the
[42:23.980 --> 42:27.860]  it's this fundamental integration between hardware and software, and the overall experience
[42:27.860 --> 42:32.220]  that it can provide, and that you can't separate it, you can't just review a MacBook next to
[42:32.220 --> 42:37.620]  a ThinkPad without reviewing Mac OS versus Windows, or whatever else you can run on the
[42:37.620 --> 42:46.500]  ThinkPad. I think fundamentally in China, Apple is a lot more like the Apple that that's
[42:46.500 --> 42:51.260]  been wrongly assumed by the pundits over the years, they really are just another handset
[42:51.260 --> 42:56.460]  maker, or a lot closer to being just another handset maker, just another company that sells
[42:56.460 --> 43:02.380]  laptops. And that they're buying it, people are buying it for the superficial reasons
[43:02.380 --> 43:05.880]  that these pundits have said that everybody who buys Apple products has been buying Apple
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.900]  products for over the years. Yeah, I think that I think that's right, in broad strokes.
[43:09.900 --> 43:14.180]  I mean, it's not, it's not totally the case that they're completely commoditized. I mean,
[43:14.180 --> 43:18.260]  there's still, you know, if you are used to using an iPhone, you're used to using an iPhone.
[43:18.260 --> 43:21.780]  And you know, it's worth keeping in mind that Apple's installed base in China, you know,
[43:21.780 --> 43:26.060]  still grew, which, you know, suggests that it's more people have the iPhone 10 aren't
[43:26.060 --> 43:29.820]  necessarily upgrading, for example, whereas I think they might have if it was a, a new
[43:29.820 --> 43:35.820]  form factor. So it's not like they're completely commoditized, commoditized, but they are to
[43:35.820 --> 43:41.140]  a much greater extent, I think, than anywhere else, if that makes sense.
[43:41.140 --> 43:48.860]  Right, none of these are extremes. I mean, to some extent, Apple is commoditized in the
[43:48.860 --> 43:53.980]  United States, and to some extent, they are not in China, but it certainly is a bigger
[43:53.980 --> 43:56.660]  factor. Yeah, and I think you could actually go by market, I think they're probably the
[43:56.660 --> 44:00.460]  least commoditized in the United States, in part because iMessage is the biggest in the
[44:00.460 --> 44:04.620]  United States. And that's a huge differentiator. You know, Europe, for example, and this is
[44:04.620 --> 44:10.460]  where it's important to discuss the fact that WeChat is more than chat, and that the importance
[44:10.460 --> 44:15.940]  of Chinese services being different are much broader than I think people appreciate. Like
[44:15.940 --> 44:21.740]  in Europe, for example, iMessage is much less of a lock-in, but the general sort of the
[44:21.740 --> 44:26.620]  way you use an Android phone, the way you use an iPhone are different and sort of predictable
[44:26.620 --> 44:32.020]  ways. Like there's less, it's not like you're advantaged by using an Android phone in Europe
[44:32.020 --> 44:36.700]  relative to an iPhone, like you are in China, given the fact that it's so heavily customized
[44:36.700 --> 44:40.540]  to the local market. Like that dynamic really only exists in China.
[44:40.540 --> 44:48.860]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor, our good friends at Eero.
[44:48.860 --> 44:56.620]  Now, Eero makes Wi-Fi and they make it work in a way that can really, really help in a
[44:56.620 --> 45:00.540]  bigger home or an apartment where one base station can't reach everything. They create
[45:00.540 --> 45:04.220]  what's called a mesh network and you plug in multiple devices, but it all, they talk
[45:04.220 --> 45:10.420]  to each other to form one Wi-Fi network. So there's not like you have to pick like, oh,
[45:10.420 --> 45:15.460]  upstairs or downstairs from the Wi-Fi menu. It just creates one network. They have a great
[45:15.460 --> 45:19.940]  app for iOS that lets you manage the whole thing. It's not like some kind of weird janky
[45:19.940 --> 45:25.620]  thing where you go to a web browser and type in 192.168 or whatever, and then you've got
[45:25.620 --> 45:29.700]  like a weird interface to set up your router. Now it's all in the app. The app is terrific
[45:29.700 --> 45:35.840]  and they have a new Eero Plus service that is designed to provide single reliable security
[45:35.840 --> 45:41.140]  that defends all of your home's devices against a growing number of threats such as malware,
[45:41.140 --> 45:45.780]  phishing attacks, unsuitable content. You know, it gives you, Eero Plus gives you a
[45:45.780 --> 45:52.100]  way to block certain types of sites if you're a parent. And it all works right from the
[45:52.100 --> 45:57.220]  base station level. It's really, really easy to set up, easy to do. And it gives you total
[45:57.220 --> 46:02.780]  network protection, really does, and advanced security. The content blocking can work too.
[46:02.780 --> 46:07.860]  It can even help you block ads and stuff like that right at the router level so you don't
[46:07.860 --> 46:11.820]  have to worry about installing it on content blocker type things on every single device
[46:11.820 --> 46:19.540]  that you have. All of this is really great. You can even get VPN protection with encrypt.me.
[46:19.540 --> 46:25.260]  It's really great. The single router model, it just doesn't work. It really doesn't. I
[46:25.260 --> 46:30.580]  think it's gotten worse with just the proliferation of Wi-Fi networks. It just makes it harder
[46:30.580 --> 46:36.540]  to set it up. I've been using Eero for years. And when we moved a couple years ago, there's
[46:36.540 --> 46:40.540]  just no way. Our new house, there is absolutely no way. I don't think anybody makes a single
[46:40.540 --> 46:45.220]  router that would go because it's a townhouse. It's got four floors. I don't see how we could
[46:45.220 --> 46:51.260]  possibly get good Wi-Fi all the way from the basement to the top floor. With Eero, we do.
[46:51.260 --> 46:57.180]  It's really easy. And it's so easy to set up. It's plug them in. You just plug them
[46:57.180 --> 47:01.260]  into the wall and that's it. And then they talk to each other. They see each other. You
[47:01.260 --> 47:05.860]  manage it all from one app. And when you want to do something like, let's say, you get their
[47:05.860 --> 47:12.500]  default package. It's a base unit. That's the thing you plug into like your cable modem
[47:12.500 --> 47:15.780]  and two of their beacons. Their beacons are the little smaller ones. They're like little
[47:15.780 --> 47:23.300]  wall lights. And they even have a little light if you want to. And you can turn that light
[47:23.300 --> 47:30.300]  on and off in the app or have it come on at certain times of day. Let's say you get that.
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.820]  You get the base unit, two beacons, and it's not quite enough. Maybe you want one more.
[47:34.820 --> 47:39.460]  We just buy one more and you just plug it in and it couldn't be easier to add it. It's
[47:39.460 --> 47:43.700]  not you have to start over or anything like that. Really, really terrific. I've been using
[47:43.700 --> 47:49.660]  them for years. And it's really the Wi-Fi in my house is so much better than it was
[47:49.660 --> 47:58.260]  before. So here's where you go to find out more. Go to Eero.com. Check out with the code
[47:58.260 --> 48:07.460]  the talk show. And if you buy a base unit and two beacons and one year of Eero plus,
[48:07.460 --> 48:15.780]  you'll save 100 bucks. That's a tremendous savings. $100 just for getting a base kit
[48:15.780 --> 48:23.260]  with the base station, two beacons and one year of Eero plus 100 bucks off at Eero.com.
[48:23.260 --> 48:30.780]  Remember that code, the talk show. Before we get off of China, I wanted to just talk
[48:30.780 --> 48:38.580]  briefly about this situation with the Huawei CFO who was arrested, detained in Canada.
[48:38.580 --> 48:44.260]  And she's still detained there. I think she's out on bail or something, but the US is trying
[48:44.260 --> 48:51.220]  to extradite her to the United States. I don't want to get into the too much in the details
[48:51.220 --> 48:57.860]  of it, but what they're accusing her of is more or less laundering money to Iran. I forget
[48:57.860 --> 49:05.300]  where else, but Iran obviously has international sanctions against it. And the charges from
[49:05.300 --> 49:07.260]  the United States are pretty serious.
[49:07.260 --> 49:15.620]  Yeah. So the limitation is Huawei is not supposed to be selling this advanced stuff to Iran.
[49:15.620 --> 49:20.620]  And the reason why the US has leverage over that is because it involves a lot of US components.
[49:20.620 --> 49:25.140]  So those components are not supposed to be sold on into Iran because of the sanctions.
[49:25.140 --> 49:32.620]  And the accusation is that they set up basically a shell company to do that. And then she told
[49:32.620 --> 49:37.060]  the banks that, no, we're not associated with that shell company any longer or something
[49:37.060 --> 49:41.940]  along those lines. And then they still were. So I think the accusation is wire fraud. We're
[49:41.940 --> 49:49.460]  basically lying to the banks and forcing the banks to break sanctions unwittingly.
[49:49.460 --> 49:55.820]  And so obviously there could be more charges, but that's sort of the nut of it. So yeah,
[49:55.820 --> 50:01.580]  so sorry, that was the sort of 30 second overview of the case.
[50:01.580 --> 50:09.800]  But it's unseemly. I mean, even if the charges are accurate, it's politically difficult because
[50:09.800 --> 50:16.660]  Huawei is tied at everything in China, tied to the state to some degree.
[50:16.660 --> 50:24.460]  Yeah. Well, not only that, but she's the daughter of the founder, right?
[50:24.460 --> 50:29.200]  And so my thought on that was, boy, I sure wouldn't want to be the next senior executive
[50:29.200 --> 50:36.380]  from Apple to go to China because, and I don't think that that's likely that they would trump
[50:36.380 --> 50:41.180]  up charges against somebody from Apple or some other American major American corporation
[50:41.180 --> 50:47.940]  and detain them similarly. But also if they did it, I wouldn't be shocked, right? It's
[50:47.940 --> 50:55.840]  not out of character for a regime like China's. Yeah, it's very complicated because I would
[50:55.840 --> 51:02.460]  say that without speaking about this case specifically, I would say the likelihood that
[51:02.460 --> 51:10.940]  Huawei is engaged in sanction avoiding behavior in a way that is problematic is pretty close
[51:10.940 --> 51:18.820]  to a hundred percent. I think what makes this particularly challenging on all sides is I
[51:18.820 --> 51:22.480]  think everyone's kind of known it's a hundred percent for a long time and no one's done
[51:22.480 --> 51:27.580]  anything about it. And obviously, this isn't the first time this has happened either in
[51:27.580 --> 51:36.380]  the last few years. ZTE got the basically, US companies were forbidden to export to ZTE
[51:36.380 --> 51:42.500]  the number two Chinese telecom manufacturer. And there's basically a death sentence. Like
[51:42.500 --> 51:48.740]  Chinese, the US technology is still at the core of, it's not just phones, it's the Hawaiians
[51:48.740 --> 51:55.300]  ZTE are on the base stations, like the things that sit on the cell phone towers and actually
[51:55.300 --> 52:02.380]  do all that. And there's lots of, ZTE and Huawei, the connection to the Chinese military
[52:02.380 --> 52:09.700]  is strongly suspected publicly. There is lots of sort of redacted classified questions about
[52:09.700 --> 52:15.380]  this where I think the understanding is the US has a lot of evidence that that's the case.
[52:15.380 --> 52:19.760]  And that's why, for example, Huawei base stations and whatnot are not allowed in the US. You
[52:19.760 --> 52:26.380]  have to buy from Nokia or from Ericsson. And that's actually spreading. I think Japan recently
[52:26.380 --> 52:31.620]  moved against Huawei. I think there's a discussion at least in the UK about that happening. And
[52:31.620 --> 52:38.260]  so it's a, but then you tie in the sort of the fact, well, you weren't sort of enforcing
[52:38.260 --> 52:41.220]  this, or you were letting them get away with it for a long time. And then there's also
[52:41.220 --> 52:48.220]  the trade especially going on and it's a senior executive and it's a sort of situation where
[52:48.220 --> 52:52.380]  you can choose almost any frame to look at it and decide that what the US is doing is
[52:52.380 --> 52:58.340]  right or wrong and you could be correct. Like in a broad global scope, is it a good thing?
[52:58.340 --> 53:03.020]  In the context of bilateral relations is a good thing. As far as the rule of law, is
[53:03.020 --> 53:08.900]  it a good thing? And you have a different answer in perhaps every case, but the fact
[53:08.900 --> 53:14.860]  that it's a, you know, once you get to the level of nation States, like it's, it's not
[53:14.860 --> 53:18.340]  what really like a contractual engagement that's going to be educated in the court of
[53:18.340 --> 53:21.660]  law, right? Like you're dealing with nation state politics and they're the ones that make
[53:21.660 --> 53:27.300]  the laws with guns behind them. And which means that the, the calculus is very, very
[53:27.300 --> 53:30.940]  different as to what is going on and whether it's the right thing to do.
[53:30.940 --> 53:35.820]  Yeah, it's less of a judicial issue than an executive issue, really.
[53:35.820 --> 53:41.380]  Right. And it's, it's politics. It is. It's international relations at the absolute highest
[53:41.380 --> 53:49.260]  level. And, and the reality of, I think you're about Apple. I mean, the reality is that Apple
[53:49.260 --> 53:56.460]  is when you're the size of Apple and you're synonymous with the US as Apple is. And when
[53:56.460 --> 54:00.780]  you're exposed to multiple countries, the way Apple is, yeah, the risk is extremely
[54:00.780 --> 54:05.580]  high. I think for now, the, what I've heard from people on the, sort of on the ground
[54:05.580 --> 54:11.540]  in general is it's, it's a lot more dodgy right now to be a Canadian. In part because
[54:11.540 --> 54:18.340]  Canada is the one that arrested her and also Canada kind of like can't like, China may
[54:18.340 --> 54:24.420]  be bad at the US, but the US has a lot of leverage and power, you know, over China.
[54:24.420 --> 54:27.220]  Whereas, you know, and so I think they're kind of taking it out on Canadians. Like there's
[54:27.220 --> 54:32.980]  been a few Canadian executives arrested or Canadian nationals for very dubious reasons.
[54:32.980 --> 54:37.140]  But yeah, it's, it's a, it's a mess. It is absolutely a mess, but it's a mess. It's like,
[54:37.140 --> 54:42.860]  if they're actually, you know, if they are quite clearly violating the law, then well,
[54:42.860 --> 54:47.620]  maybe it isn't, you know, like I said, there's no sort of right answer here.
[54:47.620 --> 54:56.940]  Here's another, here's another one. Here's a new topic. I thought this was an interesting
[54:56.940 --> 55:03.220]  Steven Sinofsky, former Microsoft executive now sort of a pundit at large. Had a couple
[55:03.220 --> 55:10.420]  of threads in recent weeks on Apple, but he closed one with a post PPPs. And I thought
[55:10.420 --> 55:14.740]  this tweet was pretty interesting. Just that, just this tweet in and of itself, let me read
[55:14.740 --> 55:20.700]  it. The idea that Apple is on some countdown clock to a quote, next big thing is completely
[55:20.700 --> 55:24.700]  the opposite of what to worry about. That is the mistake analysts are making just as
[55:24.700 --> 55:33.220]  with Adobe. Nothing is bigger than Photoshop or Microsoft with office yet, but so what
[55:33.220 --> 55:39.780]  focus on execution. I do. There is sort of an obsession, especially with Apple with what's
[55:39.780 --> 55:45.220]  the next big thing. And, you know, so many, it's so obvious there might, there will be
[55:45.220 --> 55:50.700]  a next thing eventually, you know, the watch is certainly a new thing, but nothing's ever
[55:50.700 --> 55:54.820]  going to be the iPhone again. I mean, it's almost, it's almost impossible. It may not
[55:54.820 --> 55:59.220]  be possible for any company to come up with something as great of a consumer product as
[55:59.220 --> 56:04.980]  profitable as the iPhone again, let alone the odds that it would be the same company.
[56:04.980 --> 56:11.060]  And I don't think it's, I, you know, and I've seen it, there's a lot of Tim Cook haters
[56:11.060 --> 56:15.300]  out there. There always have been. I mean, there were Steve Jobs haters too, but there's
[56:15.300 --> 56:19.300]  a certain contingent of people who really, really don't like Tim Cook. And boy, did I
[56:19.300 --> 56:27.640]  hear from them in the last week or two. I mean, people who really, really are, you know,
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.420]  and it's ultimately is his decision, but the, you know, the basic idea and they love to
[56:31.420 --> 56:35.340]  trot out that Steve Jobs quote about Steve Ballmer and, you know, that, that they turned
[56:35.340 --> 56:38.500]  it over, who do you turn it over to? You know, you turn it over to the numbers guy and then
[56:38.500 --> 56:43.180]  what do you get? You run the company by the numbers. And, you know, Tim Cook was obviously,
[56:43.180 --> 56:48.420]  you know, he wasn't a product person, never claimed to be, you know, but they blame it.
[56:48.420 --> 56:54.660]  They blamed Tim Cook for the rising price of Apple products. And, and it's, you know,
[56:54.660 --> 57:05.660]  it, it, it, you know, it's undeniable that the prices have gone up a lot recently. But
[57:05.660 --> 57:10.500]  this idea that Tim Cook is, is, is obviously a failure because if, you know, somebody,
[57:10.500 --> 57:14.340]  if the right person had gotten the job after Jobs had died, you know, Apple would have
[57:14.340 --> 57:18.820]  come out with, you know, the next big thing or two by now because, and I think that's
[57:18.820 --> 57:22.460]  completely wrong. I really do. And I don't, and I think that an obsession with that would
[57:22.460 --> 57:30.660]  be a disaster for Apple's leadership and would lead them to, you know, change that,
[57:30.660 --> 57:34.820]  you know, thousand no's for every yes mentality, which I think is, you know, maybe the numbers
[57:34.820 --> 57:38.700]  are exaggerated, but I think it's mostly true.
[57:38.700 --> 57:45.100]  I completely agree. I think the, it's not just a matter of, you can look at this, I
[57:45.100 --> 57:52.140]  think from a, a very sort of analytical lens that, and come to no other conclusion than
[57:52.140 --> 57:57.620]  the fact that the iPhone will never be matched. And, and I wrote, I wrote this article back
[57:57.620 --> 58:05.420]  in 2016 is called everything as a service. And one of the points is that the, the most
[58:05.420 --> 58:13.980]  valuable sort of manifestation of a particular technology is at the very end of its sort
[58:13.980 --> 58:19.540]  of like viability. And what I mean is like the, the best possible sort of like carriage
[58:19.540 --> 58:23.460]  was like the last carriage that was made before cars came along. And like the most valuable
[58:23.460 --> 58:27.820]  car was one that came along, will be the one, you know, the most valuable gas car, the best
[58:27.820 --> 58:31.460]  performing gas car is going to be the last one before sort of electric takes over. Like
[58:31.460 --> 58:34.280]  that's just sort of the way, you know, if you think about it, that's quite obviously
[58:34.280 --> 58:38.620]  the case. And I think it's from Horace, I think it's from Horace Deju, but one of the,
[58:38.620 --> 58:43.300]  my favorite examples of that was that when jet aircraft carriers came out, the propeller
[58:43.300 --> 58:48.140]  planes at the time were way better, way more comfortable. They flew faster. They were,
[58:48.140 --> 58:52.980]  they were way, you know, as a, but they were doomed for, for many reasons. Like the jets
[58:52.980 --> 58:58.140]  overtook them, but it was, it took years after the introduction of the jet engine for them
[58:58.140 --> 59:03.020]  to overtake the propeller planes in the market. Yeah, I, that, that's exactly right. And,
[59:03.020 --> 59:08.380]  and so the, the, if you think, so that's, this is the overall sort of concept. You think
[59:08.380 --> 59:15.780]  about the iPhone specifically and what makes the iPhone so insanely valuable is that first
[59:15.780 --> 59:21.180]  it's a physical object and a physical, you think about how the challenge with sort of
[59:21.180 --> 59:26.100]  digital goods, how do you monetize digital goods? Because a digital good is by definition
[59:26.100 --> 59:31.220]  sort of, there's no scarcity. It can be duplicated endlessly. And which means that the sort of
[59:31.220 --> 59:35.380]  inherent value of a digital item is zero. And you see this in things like the music
[59:35.380 --> 59:39.020]  industry, for example, right there, the longer they try to hold onto selling songs, the more
[59:39.020 --> 59:45.460]  they were doomed. Now, music companies, they don't sell songs anymore. They sell convenience,
[59:45.460 --> 59:49.780]  right? The point of Apple Music and Spotify is you can conveniently get access to any
[59:49.780 --> 59:54.260]  song that you want to. And the music is kind of a byproduct of when the actual selling
[59:54.260 --> 59:58.340]  proposition is convenience. And that's, that's a business model that makes sense with digital
[59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.740]  goods. The thing with the phone though, is it's a physical good, which means there is
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.900]  scarcity, which means you can, like there is inherent economic value to a physical good
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.220]  in a way that there isn't with a digital good, but it is a physical good that is differentiated
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:20.180]  by software, by that, that sort of ineffable component that is endlessly duplicable, endlessly
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.380]  sort of iterable. You can constantly be improving it, making it better. You can build these
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:30.040]  sort of differentiations. So the iPhone has all the benefits of being a hardware product
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.220]  as far as monetization goes, and as all the benefits of software, as far as differentiation
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:41.260]  goes, it's really the absolute perfect marriage of these two models such that you can drive
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:45.720]  high differentiation through software and you can reap and capture that differentiation
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.980]  by charging money for a physical device and a physical device that by the way, wears out
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:56.580]  breaks, you know, needs replacements, so on and so forth. It is the absolute perfect possible
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.420]  sort of business that you could ever be in because it has all the benefits of digital
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.180]  and all the benefits of being a hardware good. And I don't think we'll ever be in that state
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:09.540]  again, like the, the future of physical goods differentiated by software is they are going
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:14.220]  to rent them, right? You think about self-driving cars, it makes much, it just makes intuitive
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.460]  sense in the long run that, you know, Uber and self-driving cars are a natural marriage,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.820]  right? Or an Uber type service where you call it up on your phone and it drives around,
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:29.440]  it picks you up and you go. The, like the, the, the reasons why we would buy a car are
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.980]  were because we didn't have the sort of technology to make an always available car that, that
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.140]  made, that made sense. And, and you think going forward, this is going to make sense
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:44.380]  for so many things that because we have a device with us all the time that we can access
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:51.000]  the internet and access anything we want to, like this rental model of very high cost physical
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.980]  goods is going to, I think be more and more predominant, which means like, what's like,
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.860]  really like what's next? I mean, yes, I guess maybe AR glasses or something, but if you
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:06.860]  think about it, like there's always, the phone is, it's so, it's perfect in so many ways.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.580]  It's big enough that you can information do things on it. It's small enough. You can carry
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:16.760]  it with you. It is, it is really the perfect product in a way that it's very hard to imagine.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.540]  You can imagine lots of other good businesses, but the perfection of the business model combined
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:27.100]  with the form factor and the perfection of the product itself, it seems, if you think
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.360]  about it, it's obvious there will never be anything to match it. Yeah. And the way that
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:38.660]  it's, it's actually eaten a bunch of sub markets, cameras for one thing, right? Consumer cameras
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:44.620]  are still exist, but that they've been decimated by phones. I mean, it's, when you go on vacation,
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:48.020]  go anywhere touristy these days, when you actually pay attention and look for people
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:53.720]  using cameras as cameras, not phones as cameras, it's hard. It is. It's hard to go to Disney
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.820]  world and find people using a real camera or, or if you do, it's very, very obvious
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.540]  because it's actually like an SLR size camera with, you know, a big black lens. You know,
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.740]  it's, it, it's somebody who's buying a truly expert for at least a consumer, like, you
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:14.620]  know, what's the word prosumer level camera. But for like the point and shoots gone eaten
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:22.220]  by cell phones voice recorders. Right. I don't know that that was a huge market selling little
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.640]  personal tape recorders. But who buys them anymore? Everybody just uses the voice recorder
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:33.660]  on their phone. You know, like last year when they were like five or six of us who got invited
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:42.540]  to Apple to talk about the Mac Pro. And we were allowed to record it. We weren't supposed
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.140]  to publish the recording, but we could record it for our own notes. All of us, every single
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:54.620]  person used their iPhone as the recorder. It's, you know, that's just not something
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:58.940]  people buy anymore. There's so many things like that. Yeah. And they're all in the phone.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.300]  Yep. In the, in the phone, like their alarm clocks, who buys an alarm clock anymore? The
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.240]  why we should have the Google home out, by the way, would you know, just as that reminded
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.940]  me, cause we mentioned, give it back to a little bit, but the I wrote this about this
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.360]  idea of there being, I think some people really misunderstood about the iPhone, you know,
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.060]  way back when, I mean, this is back when I started and you know, pure doubt, the iPhone
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.900]  disruption and et cetera, et cetera, whatever. The iPhone is a unique product in that it's
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:32.880]  not really a, it's not a disruptive product. It's a product that has come in on top that
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.600]  is more expensive, that does more than what is in the market. That's the opposite of what
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:42.180]  a sort of disruptive product is supposed to be. And the, yes, it's disruptive. The laptops
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.540]  in the long run, I get that, but relative to other cell phones, it was what I turned
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:53.180]  on being obsolete of, or in that it, it, it made so many things that were cheaper obsolete.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.820]  It made your camera obsolete. It made a calculator obsolete. It made all sorts of things that
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:04.220]  you would otherwise buy individually. And it just sort of subsube them into one device
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:10.760]  or maybe obviate is maybe a better term. And the PC did that back in the day. Like there's
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.940]  always pictures of like this desk with all these tools on it. And then there's only a
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:19.860]  PC and the phone did the exact same thing. And it's a sort of, it's a different dynamic
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:26.160]  where it sort of comes in over the top, but it's, it's, you know, it's very hard is continued
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.900]  to do that over time. Yeah. There's somebody has a similar picture. I remember, I remember
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.780]  it went super viral on Twitter where they had literally had the cover, either the cover
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.380]  of a Radio Shack catalog or, or just, I think it might've been an advertisement, you know,
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:46.020]  like a, you know, mid 1980s radio shack ad and it had like 20 different products and
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.620]  every single one of them is on your cell phone. Now it was like they had video cameras, they
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.220]  had still cameras, calculators, all these things and every single thing. It was like
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.780]  uncanny. It was almost like you can't believe that this wasn't ginned up and it's fake,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.220]  but it was actually like a real Radio Shack ad and everything that they were advertising
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:07.300]  was all on your cell phone. Now. Yep. Basically, basically the form factor rules, anything
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.140]  that, that, that was sort of portable and, and caribou is going to, was going to end
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.780]  up on the phone and that's, that's what's happened and that's why it's such a great
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:19.460]  product, but then it follows then like what's going to actually replace that cause you have
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:24.140]  to replace not just a phone, you have to replace all that functionality with something else,
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.180]  right? Yeah, sure. Maybe you can go out for a run with just your Apple watch and your
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:32.380]  AirPods, but then you still need a camera sometimes. Then you still need a screen to
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:37.300]  watch video. Like that's why I think the phone is, and this is why, you know, I thought my
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:41.640]  article this week was, was actually relatively optimistic. I think this is a bit of an overreaction
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.100]  because yes, Apple, people might be holding on their phones longer. Yes, China is an issue,
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.660]  but the fact of the matter is phones aren't going anywhere and within the phone market
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.820]  everywhere except for China, Apple is not going anywhere either. And frankly in China
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.980]  their install base still grew. So it's not like they were, they were necessarily like
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:04.340]  bleeding customers either. I mean the company, I think, I think there's been a bit of overreaction.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:09.900]  Like I think they're, yes, the days of growth are over, but that's, I think been clear for
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.140]  a while for people that are paying attention. But I, that doesn't mean it doesn't follow
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:22.120]  from that, that the decline is, is, has now arrived. Yeah. And the other thing that plays
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.820]  into your point from a few minutes ago about the difference between a physical good and
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:31.820]  a digital good is there's a resale market for physical goods, right? And you mentioned
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:34.980]  music. I still think back, there was a time in college, you know, I went to college in
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:40.660]  the mid nineties. There was a time in college when I got to thinking about my net worth
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:47.140]  just as an abstract idea. And often as like a typical college student, I might have under
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:50.980]  a hundred dollars in my bank account. I mean maybe if I was lucky. I mean like I always
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:57.140]  say, like I knew the one that there was a, a particular ATM that aid I could get without
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:03.340]  a fee cause it was like on my, my ATM story. Yeah, I remember. No, I would. And it gave
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.580]  out, it was a machine that gave out tens and most of the machines only gave out twenties.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.940]  And so, so like when I was under $20 if I had somewhere between 10 and $20 I could still
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:17.760]  get a $10 bill out of that. And then, you know, figure out how to, how to get my parents
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.380]  to give me some more money. I figured out, you know, the only things I had of any value,
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:29.660]  I had a Macintosh, which I couldn't part with, um, or I wouldn't want to part with and CDs.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:36.180]  I had like, I didn't have a massive CD collection and you know, and I had a, a, a little hi
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:42.540]  fi system to play CDs that was maybe worth, I don't know, 150 bucks. But I had, I would,
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.060]  let me think about this. If I had 200 to see, yeah, I had thousands of dollars worth of
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.500]  CDs. I don't know if I had 200 CDs, you know, that sounds about right. Not a big collection,
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.780]  but you know, it took up a couple of rows on it. One of those CD holders that was four
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:02.300]  or five feet high. Um, and you could sell them, you could, there was a very vibrant
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:07.380]  market and use CDs, you know, uh, college campus, typical, you know, some, it was one
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:11.820]  on Penn's campus right next to Drexel's and you could go there and get a fair amount of
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:17.760]  your money for a CD. You know, you could get, you know, a CD that maybe you bought for $16.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.420]  You could sell it for, I don't know, like eight and then you could buy the used CDs
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:27.700]  there for like 10 or 11 or something like that. Like the idea that I had my significant
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:35.540]  portion of my liquid wealth in, in music makes no sense today. Like how in the world would
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:42.260]  a college student sell their music? Like it doesn't make any, it would, it's, it's almost
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:46.940]  laughable how different the world has gotten in those 25 years. Half our listeners don't
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:54.220]  even know what a CD is. And it's fascinating to me that the one way you still can buy and
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:10:01.700]  sell music is with vinyl, right? That there's, because vinyl is sufficiently differentiated
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:06.180]  from digital music that it sounds different and works different and looks different, has
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.780]  a different tactile sense to it has left it as the, I mean, who the hell would have predicted
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:16.060]  that in the nineties that vinyl would, would be the last, the last physical medium for
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.220]  music, but it is, and there still are music stores that sell, but they all sell vinyl
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.260]  to my knowledge. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. For those of you who are young, it's just
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:31.740]  crazy. It's crazy how common record stores were in the eighties and nineties. Like my
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.940]  typical, my hometown shopping mall was not even that particularly large. I think it had
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.860]  three record stores. It was, they were record stores that were, they were more record stores
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.420]  than drugstores. I totally remember. And then what was the, what was the like Columbia house
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.380]  or whatever, where you would get like the six CDs for, for, do you remember to cancel
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.420]  every month? Cause they would also, they'd send you some crappy CD that you didn't want
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:58.660]  for like $25. Yeah. It was, it was a whole racket. Yeah. They had the Columbia house
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:03.100]  had the thing where their, their advertisement would literally have like a, a outline of
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.540]  a penny and it was, they wanted you to scotch tape a penny, fill out your name and your
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.220]  address and here in name your name, the six albums you want, send them one penny and they'll
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:16.700]  send you six albums. But then you're, you were on the hook for like, like the album
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:22.300]  of the month. Yep. You didn't even get to pick what they sent you. No, you, you could
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:27.380]  decline it, but to decline it was like a big pain in the ass. So the way the business model
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:32.100]  worked is people would forget to decline it and then they get just this terrible CDs in
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:39.540]  the mail that they paid like $22 for or something like that. Yeah. It was very devious. But
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.420]  anyway, in today's world that, you know, the iPhone absolutely plays into that and, and
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:48.940]  the way that Apple's, you know, how, how are, how is their user base for the iPhone growing
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.980]  when their sales are down year over year? And it's because people, you know, there's,
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:58.240]  there's this second hand market for iPhones that is significant, whether it's actually
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.380]  selling them and buying a used one or getting a refurbished phone or, you know, like I think
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.140]  it's probably super, super common in families handing down older phones from parents to
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:15.100]  kids and, and keeping them in use for, you know, for years to come. You know, so in terms
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.180]  of Apple's services narrative, which I definitely want to talk to you about significantly, you
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:26.020]  know, it, it, on the upside for Apple, you know, the, the, the iPhone user base is still
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.580]  growing in a way that handset sales aren't. That's exactly right. But you should do an
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.340]  ad and then we can, then we can, then we can gripe about services. All right. I will do
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:40.860]  an ad. This is going to be a great ad. He sponsored the show before. Do you hear this?
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.620]  You can't hear it Ben, but in the people out in the real world, when they listen to the
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.540]  show, we're going to hear it. They're going to hear music right now, which is amazing
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:53.020]  because there's usually not music on the show, but music is a crucial part of almost every
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.060]  visual project. You know, like you can make a movie if you're on YouTube doing that sort
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.540]  of thing, your next film commercial or app, right? Cause you can't release a new app now
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:05.780]  without a video that needs music to tell a story and pairing your work with a perfect
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:11.020]  piece of music is sort of like finding the project soulmate. It's an intimate connection.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:17.540]  The right music. What makes it right? It's ineffable. Well, meet composer Alex Weinstein.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.580]  Alex has over a decade of experience writing music for commercial and films. His clients
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:27.900]  include Amazon, Starbucks, Disney, true car, Etsy, and others. He's a long time collaborator
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:32.700]  with my personal friend, often guest on the show, Adam Lisagor and sandwich video. He's
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:37.060]  worked with them on a lot of products, projects. If you recall the, the occasionally used theme
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:42.100]  song for the talk show, picking boogers with John, that's an Alex Weinstein song. So what
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:47.780]  makes his music different? It's all handmade and organic, beautiful instrumentation, infections,
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:53.540]  rhythms, and a humanistic approach to composition, referring live raw sounds that don't sound
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:14:01.140]  machine made. So there's two services, custom and library custom music. That's when you
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:07.940]  work with Alex to make a brand new song, soundtrack, something like that, creating a score that
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:12.900]  matches your vision. You can hire him, you can work with him, create your own original
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:19.740]  music. Also, there's the library. Alex has carefully curated a library of just a few
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:25.900]  hundred songs, and all are available for non-exclusive license. Finding a great track couldn't be
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:31.700]  easier. He's got different styles of music, fun, strange, quirky, thoughtful, simple and
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:37.660]  intuitive search. You can preview tracks without irritating audio watermarks, and you can purchase
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:43.220]  a license right in the browser and download broadcast ready files right there. It's great
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:48.020]  stuff. You're listening to it now. Use promo code the talk show and you will get 30% off
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:57.740]  your first purchase from the license store. Visit alexweinstein.com. A-L-E-X-W-E-I-N-S-T-E-I-N.

[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:10.620]  love Alex Weinstein and his work. My thanks to Alex for sponsoring the show. What's next
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.620]  on our list?
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:16.740]  Well, I think the services one is the obvious sort of segue because your point, the payoff
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:22.220]  for Apple is as long as Apple is only making money from selling devices, the fact that
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:27.500]  people are buying secondhand devices or using hand-me-down devices is a bad thing, right?
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:33.860]  Because they are using those devices instead of buying something new, and they're basically
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:42.420]  competing with themselves. And so the great lure of a quote-unquote services narrative
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.500]  is that actually that's good news. People buying secondhand phones is a good thing for
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.700]  Apple. People using hand-me-down phones is a good thing for Apple. People holding onto
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.740]  their phones, yeah, it'd be great if they bought a new one, but as long as they're still
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:59.300]  using an iPhone and not buying something else, then it's all to the benefit of Apple. And
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:05.860]  I think that's a very sort of legitimate argument to make.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.740]  Before we move on to services, actually, that reminds me that I wanted to mention a theory
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:14.700]  of mine. And again, I think if it's true, if there's any truth to it, I think it's a
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:23.260]  tweak. It's not like this explains everything. It is one factor among many. But I wrote back
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.740]  in November that if there's any truth to this, hey, iPhone XR is selling less than expected
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:35.420]  and maybe not doing as well as iPhone 8 did versus iPhone X a year ago. And I wrote that
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:43.460]  I suspect that it might, at least to a few percentage points, be that people are resistant
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:49.580]  to the fundamental change in the interaction model of the iPhone that the X introduced.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.900]  No home button, no touch ID, which is actually one and the same. Even the no headphone jack,
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:03.780]  I think, which didn't start with the iPhone X. But I don't know. And boy, oh boy, after
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.060]  this Apple news came out, I heard from an awful lot of people who swear up and down
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:13.340]  that they're not getting rid of their iPhone 6s or their iPhone 7. I guess the 6s was very
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:21.260]  common, but until Apple brings back touch ID and the home button. And there are certain
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:26.860]  cases where face ID is not as good. I've noticed more and more like in the morning, I don't
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.540]  know what I look like when I wake up, but it must be awful because most of the time
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:35.860]  my phone doesn't recognize me. Well, you have to hold it away from your face. That's the
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.420]  issue that I found because in the morning I don't have my glasses on. And so I want
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:42.500]  to put it around my face, but now I'm in the habit of holding it out like, you know, 10
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:48.300]  inches. I often, when I still read on the phone, when I go to bed and I have my glasses
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.580]  off and my contacts out and I have to hold it close to my face and I don't seem to have
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:56.660]  nearly as much problem right before I go to bed without my glasses on holding the phone
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:02.060]  closer to my face. I don't know. But I mean, and, and somebody, you know, people often
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:06.980]  bring up like when you have the phone mounted on the dashboard of your car, it, it, you
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:11.780]  can't unlock it with face ID because you know, it's not pointed right at you. And you know,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.780]  if you're driving, you probably shouldn't be unlocking it period. But I know that, you
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:18.060]  know, there's cases, you know, where you might be completely stopped or somewhere it might
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:23.180]  actually, you know, even if you are actually being responsible person driving a car using
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:30.100]  a phone. You know, but I think that I think it's mostly psychological though. I think
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:35.580]  it's largely the fact that they're, you know, most people aren't early adopter types and
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.300]  they don't like fundamental changes like this or, or they're resistant to them before they
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:46.420]  try them. And I think that moving all of the new phones for this year to the new model
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.900]  I think has hurt them to some degree and maybe more than they predicted. And boy, I just
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:57.460]  heard so much in the last two weeks of people who are, you know, or last week mostly, I
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.940]  guess. It seems like two weeks ago, but it's been a long week. But so many people who think
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:06.420]  that that's part of the problem that Apple made a huge blunder by getting rid of touch
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.680]  ID and the home button.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.100]  It's at least a reason to hold onto your phone longer and you combine it with the higher
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.700]  prices and all the things that are going on. And you know, this can be very interesting
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:22.140]  to see. There's, I'm glad you brought that up. I agree that that point is very interesting
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:27.740]  and I think there might be something there and there's two other points. One is Apple's,
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:31.660]  you know, doesn't release unit sales anymore, but they do still release by geography and
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:35.620]  it's going to be very, very interesting to see because if you read carefully what Click
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:40.900]  wrote, all the problem is iPhone and most of the problem iPhone problem is China, but
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.780]  that means there is a bit of an iPhone problem somewhere other than China. So it'll be very
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:51.500]  interesting to see where that is. I think the battery placement thing is also very interesting.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:56.780]  You know, did that like if the US ends up being lower than other places that I think
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.260]  that would suggest there might be something there. And so that's going to be, I'm looking
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.380]  forward to that in the earnings to see, see what that says.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.900]  Yeah, that was an interesting thing that Cook called out both in his open letter to the
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:16.100]  public and reiterated in TV interviews with CNBC afterwards that the iPhone discount battery
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:20.580]  replacement program, which turned what I think was usually like a $79 battery replacement
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.980]  into a $29 battery replacement. Something like that.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:31.600]  You know, played a factor in the slower sales. Right. And people are trying to make the argument
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.820]  that they lost revenue on batteries. No, I think it's pretty clear that some people replace
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.580]  their battery instead of getting a new phone. Like, I think that's almost, I wouldn't be
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.220]  surprised that there's some aspect of people didn't even know they could replace their
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:49.820]  battery until it became sort of new cycle. Well, and I think that it clearly, when it
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:54.660]  became a new cycle, it broke through to more people that that is the explanation for the
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:00.860]  slowness that they were actually seeing, you know, that and you know, that's actually common
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:06.180]  sense to me that people would never they wouldn't guess a normal person would not ever guess
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:11.380]  that the reason they're there three year old iPhone feels so much slower than it used to
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:16.260]  is because it needs a new battery. Like that just doesn't it makes sense when you really
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:21.780]  understand how they work and what was going on. And you know that the CPU has to be throttled
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:27.580]  and it needs the full speed of the CPU with a healthy battery to run the user interface
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:34.180]  the way it's supposed to be run. But the way most products that people know that are battery
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:41.140]  run work, it's, that's not how a battery that needs to be replaced works, right? That's
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:47.180]  how it manifests itself. Right, it just feels broken. And I think, you know, I think that
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.420]  people's experience with computers, which is largely based on using Windows PCs, there
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:56.060]  is, you know, what do they call it link rot, you know, that you keep using Windows for
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.420]  a couple of years and the computer gets slower just because that's how, you know, Windows
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.820]  works, you know, that it, I think that they they sort of chalked it up to that's how old
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.340]  you know, that's what happens, your phone gets old, and it gets slow, and then you have
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:12.460]  to get a new one. And I think, you know, whatever number of people that that news broke through
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:16.900]  to that, hey, you could actually you might be able to, you know, check this in iOS. And
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.220]  if it says, you know, you could get a battery replacement, bring it to Apple for two and
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.580]  for 29 bucks, they'll replace it.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:27.620]  You know, I'm reminded of remember when SSDs are first coming out. And if you put an SSD
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:31.780]  in your computer, it felt like a completely new computer. It's like, wow, absolutely
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.700]  get a new computer at all. This is this is amazing. It's almost like a similar sort of
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]  dynamic.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.500]  No, no, no, I had that exact thing back in the early days of the talk show. Geez, probably
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:50.020]  like 10 years ago, I had a power book. And the idea of replacing hard drives in an Apple
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:56.100]  not just that, but I did the with the MacBook, they had a one of the companies had a kit
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:01.160]  where you could take out the CD drive and you could put in a second hard drive. So so
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:08.080]  I actually would have dual hard drives in in. So I think I had the idle spinning drive
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:12.720]  to be very large. And then I had a boot drive with the SSD because these were super expensive.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.740]  So you would buy like a 64 gigabyte boot drive, install OS 10 on that. And then you would
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.420]  also have the large drive if yeah, you did it all yourself. Like you would unscrew the
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:26.380]  back of your computer, you would literally take out the CD drive, put in this kit reconnected
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:31.620]  all up. It's it's amazing. It's it's wild to think it was like a three or four year
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:35.460]  old power book and I upgraded I took I think I replied I don't think I did that. I remember
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:39.740]  that though that you could take out the CD drive and replace it. I think I just replaced
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:47.940]  the hard drive with an SSD and it was uncanny how it felt like a like a brand new four year
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:53.620]  you know, four year year over year improvement power book. Although it probably cost half
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:58.660]  as much because SSDs were so expensive. But you were probably getting a better deal with
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:02.980]  your old computer with an SSD than buying a new computer with a spinning drive. Yeah,
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:08.760]  it made sense to me. It made sense to me and it turned out better even better than I expected.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:14.060]  So the other the other point to bring up with this is I'm very, I'm obviously not looking
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:18.800]  forward to a recession. But it's going to be very interesting to see what happens to
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:23.740]  Apple's business the next time there is a recession in the West, or in the United States.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:28.680]  Because the last time there was a recession, the iPhone was such an such a nascent business
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.220]  that it was still selling to people at the very sort of high end of the adoption curve
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:37.540]  so that you know, they weren't really impacted by the the Great Recession in a way that,
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:43.140]  you know, now when you're at market saturation, the the macro economic factors impact your
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:48.260]  business much more. And so as far as you know, I might still be wrong, I might have to give
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:54.820]  you back my being right point in that if their sales in the US end up being impacted dramatically
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.820]  to a similar degree that they appear to be being in China, then maybe it really was just
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:05.460]  sort of the macro economic factors as opposed to my, my conjunction, my, my thought, which
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:14.580]  is it's a combination of them conjecture. All right, let's talk about Apple's services
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.580]  narrative.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:24.660]  So I have a bit of mea culpa, I have to give back a being right chip. I've written this
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.580]  in the I've written this in the daily update. And in the in, I've already recorded this
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.700]  week for exponent. So I'm kind of repeating myself. But when Apple first came out with
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.760]  the services narrative, the timing is very interesting, because it was the first quarter
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:42.780]  of the six s, which was really, again, that's the quarter where China plummeted. And they
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.820]  tried to say, Oh, everything's great, and everything's good. And then actually ended
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.420]  up having to take like a $2 billion image inventory right down there that year, everything
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.020]  was not good, everything was not great. But I don't think it's necessarily an accident
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.260]  that that's when the services narrative came out. They did a supplementary document saying,
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:02.300]  Oh, this is actually how much money we make. And that document was kind of funny, because
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:06.420]  they took credit for all app sales, including the developer share. That was the point of
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.100]  it to say, Well, yes, we only report this much. But the actual number to think about
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:15.260]  is this much, which was, you know, the developer share. And anyhow, but that was when the narrative
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:19.660]  started. And at the time, I wrote that, oh, wait, this is ridiculous. Apple's not a services
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:27.660]  company. And that was right. Like their, their, their services business was, was a result
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:31.460]  of their hardware business, like they were still a hardware company that were developing
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:35.300]  hardware products, you know, software differentiated hardware products, and the services business
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:40.740]  was sort of like frosting on that cake. And, and I, so that's my opinion for a while of
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.820]  a couple years later, I had to come back and say, you know, I was a little unfair in their
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:51.740]  characterization. Apple is still not a services company in that they make decisions as their
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:56.740]  strategic decisions are made as a hardware company. But the from a financial perspective,
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:01.300]  it is fair to make this argument because the money is real, it's meaningful, it's growing,
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:06.260]  it's important to understand that Apple does monetize consumers over time. It is the case
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.340]  that people on secondhand iPhones are valuable to the company in a way that's not captured
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:14.420]  if you only think about a hardware thing. And so, and so I had to sort of adjust there.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:20.540]  And I think I need to adjust again in that not only is that the case that services revenue
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:25.780]  is a real thing for Apple that should be considered when analyzing them financially, but I think
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.580]  you could make the case that Apple's starting to make strategic decisions like a services
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:34.700]  company, which means they actually are starting to really be a services company. So there's
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.900]  a lot packed in there. But you gave me so much credit before I needed to, I needed to
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:43.860]  put my cards on the table and say that I wasn't completely right there. Or if anything, or
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.060]  Apple's changed over time.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:52.500]  Yeah, well, we can tie, we can tie that in and mix the pot here and talk about Apple's
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.900]  TV strategy because I think there's no better case of that than the news out of CES this
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:06.820]  week that Apple is working with, I would say the four major TV set makers, Samsung, LG,
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:15.020]  Sony and Vizio to get Apple stuff built into their TVs. And particularly interesting is
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:23.820]  Samsung who I think Samsung is getting iTunes movies and TV shows and presumably I could
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:28.420]  not believe that it wouldn't automatically include, but obviously couldn't be announced
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:39.060]  Apple's upcoming subscription streaming service. However, they're going to charge for that.
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:42.860]  So Samsung TVs are going to have that built in. So you just buy a new Samsung TV, turn
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.680]  it on and as you know, quote unquote input zero, what does the TV show you before you
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:54.500]  switch to like an HDMI thing and have like, you know, a box, put something on TV, you
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.980]  know, nowadays, they're all computers and they show you some sort of interface. Well,
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:03.940]  iTunes is going to be part of that now from Samsung of all companies, but they're also
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:12.360]  supporting AirPlay to built in. So your Samsung TV will be able to be an AirPlay to target.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:20.000]  And then the other three Sony, LG and Vizio are getting AirPlay two and HomeKit support.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.620]  So Samsung is different in that they're the only ones with iTunes at least so far. And
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:30.220]  the other ones are different because they have HomeKit support in addition to AirPlay
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:36.420]  two. And that to me is fascinating. And it certainly seems like the move of a services
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.660]  company, not a product company.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:45.340]  Absolutely. Because they may continue to sell the Apple TV, but this is like, they're no
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:49.780]  longer using services to differentiate the Apple TV. Like you buy it because you want
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:53.420]  to buy another Apple product. You don't buy it because it has anything particularly unique
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:57.820]  to it. At least your Samsung. And the fact that it's only Samsung, I don't know this
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:04.280]  for a fact. I've kind of heard scuttlebutt that Samsung processors in their TVs are significantly
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:08.940]  more powerful than everyone else. So it might just be a technical limitation where Apple
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.940]  couldn't get their software to work acceptably on the other TVs.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:16.620]  I don't know that this is the case. This is just sort of what I've heard. But I highly
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:22.060]  doubt it's like a, I think if they're going to be on Samsung, they just as soon be everywhere.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:27.060]  I don't think it's necessarily like something that's particularly unique in that case, but
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:31.260]  yeah. If you have one of these things, why buy an Apple TV? And yes, you can say, well,
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:36.180]  I like the experience better and et cetera, et cetera. But the, the, the Apple TV is very
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:43.060]  much having to compete on its own merits. And frankly, those merits are, are not particularly
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.500]  strong, particularly, especially when you consider the price. I mean, it's so much more
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:51.500]  expensive than, than the, the alternatives. It's, it's kind of crazy.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:58.620]  Yeah. And, and they didn't do the iPhone type thing, I guess, or did they, did they, can
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:04.500]  you still buy an older Apple TV and non 4k Apple TV? Maybe you can, but whatever, if
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.820]  you can, it's not as much cheaper as it should be. Like, it's not like, oh, the expensive
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:13.180]  one is the Apple TV 4k and you can, but you can get the other one for 50 bucks. It's like,
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:18.620]  you still have to pay like $130 to get one. And it's ridiculous compared to all the other
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:23.460]  things you stick into HDMI. I'm not saying it's unjustified. I'm a big Apple TV fan.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:29.220]  Almost everything I personally watch on TV, I watch through Apple TV. And there are things
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:34.520]  I would like to see improved about it. And I'm, you know, lately, I've never heard anybody
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:40.020]  defend the remote. I have never, it's like, it doesn't even seem like there's awful. Like
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:45.320]  it, it's, it's, it's not like it's, oh, they could do better. It is awful. Like it, everything
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:50.060]  about it, it's just bad. The, the number of times it, I, it bothers my mind. They could
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:56.340]  ship this just for accidental input alone. Like it's, Oh, it's you'd be in the middle
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.500]  of something or whatever. And then someone like it's getting, get set down on the couch
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.940]  or whatever and someone's butt hits it. And then suddenly like it stops the movie or fast
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:11.140]  forward. Oh, it's unbelievable how bad it is. Yeah. The accidental input is anyway,
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:15.220]  we can, we don't want to go spend too much time on the remote, but yeah, the non 4k is
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:21.340]  $150. The 4k is 180. Well, there you go. I mean, that's even more expensive than I thought.
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:27.520]  Whereas, you know, a fire TV is, I don't know, 20 bucks, 30 bucks, I don't know. And Roku's
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.360]  is similarly cheap and you know, and they're making, trying to make money by, but they
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.400]  put ads up and it's, you know, it's a very different experience. And part of what I like
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.400]  about Apple TV is knowing that I'm nothing I do through my Apple TV and, and like iTunes
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.940]  is getting sold. I'm not seeing any extra ads. No, my images are being captured by the
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:55.300]  TV and used for marketing purposes. But that's where the industry's gone, you know. You know,
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:02.380]  and, and Neil I Patel had an interesting interview with the CEO or C S CTO of Vizio at at CS
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:08.260]  this week asking about it. You know, and they call it post purchase monetization that, that
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:14.380]  the TV business is so low margin and so cut rate and, you know, costs are going, they
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:18.900]  really are going remarkably down. You can get a bigger, better TV for less money every
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:25.860]  year. It's, it's truly a remarkable market. But, you know, Vizio, you know, Vizio guy,
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.220]  he basically admitted, yeah, we, you know, part of our business model is based on the
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:34.420]  assumption that we can make money on TVs after we've sold them. And that's, you know, and
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.220]  not by people subscribing to things it's, it's by reselling the information they glean
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:44.180]  from from what's on the screen. And it's weird to see Apple getting involved with that in
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.180]  some ways.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:52.180]  Yeah, I would, I would strongly suspect that the iTunes content will not be will not be
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:57.900]  trackable. I mean, I would be pretty shocked if Apple do anything along those lines. But
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:03.580]  yeah, we'll see. But on the other hand, I got the feeling I don't even know how that
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:10.060]  works. Like I still have, by this point, ancient, I guess, I guess it's like 12 years old, jeez,
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:17.940]  plasma, you know, totally non smart TV. My TV is just the dumb terminal, you know. You
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:22.380]  know, but I, you know, it's old enough, and now small enough by today's standards that
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:27.420]  I'm definitely in the market for a new TV. But it, it really offends me deeply. That
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:32.060]  what are they called ACR, whatever they do when they but it's automatic. I said basically,
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:37.700]  it is the worst, by the way, like they are, they are, as far as this stuff goes, they've
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.980]  been busted for for all kinds of shady stuff.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:43.860]  Well, and Eli even had a tweet recently, I guess parents had a Vizio TV, and he looked
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:47.700]  like it there. I don't know if they're Euro or what, but you know, whatever the is the
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:51.980]  track which devices on the network here, like a screenshot, and it was like, like their
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:57.660]  their most active device in the house by by a factor of like 20 was their new Vizio TV,
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:03.340]  which was contacting Vizio servers like 1000s of times a day. And they, they'd never like
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.340]  signed up for anything like that. All they did was put the TV on their Wi Fi and the
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:11.780]  thing just started phoning home like a ridiculous amount of time. But I think if you plug an
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:18.060]  Apple TV into like that TV, it's going to do you know, your Apple TV box is going to
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:23.020]  you know, it's more or less what what the TV sees they see, you know, if it's on the
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.300]  screen, they can see it.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:28.700]  Interesting. I don't know. I don't know how that works.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:34.260]  Yeah, I don't know either. But it is a little bit surprising. And you know, it's just TV
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:38.380]  is a totally different market. And you know, poor Gene Munster, you know, was looking for
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:44.940]  an Apple branded television set for years and years and years. And, you know, he was
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:49.660]  obsessive, which was funny, but he wasn't fundamentally wrong, which is that that sort
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:54.260]  of seemed to be the Apple way to do something, right? That the Apple way to do it is to make
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:36:00.260]  the hardware, make it the best, integrate it with the software and sell it at a premium,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:06.100]  you know, and that the way to, you know, so that the Apple the seemingly natural way for
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:10.940]  Apple to enter the TV world would be to make an Apple branded TV set with everything built,
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:17.420]  you know, the Apple, the Apple TV computer part built in. They've obviously never done
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:24.940]  that. And even before these announcements at CES this this week, I think most of us
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:28.060]  had thought, you know, well, that ship has sailed, and they're never going to do that.
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:32.900]  But now it certainly looks as least less likely than ever that they will.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:38.180]  Yeah, it's interesting, especially in light of this tracking stuff, you would think that
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:42.900]  there would be there would be more of an opportunity that you would think but I mean, application
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.660]  would make a computer monitor. So I guess asking for a TV was was would definitely have
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.540]  been a bridge too far.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:52.700]  Well, they never said they couldn't make a TV monitor or computer monitor, they just
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:57.380]  chose to stop making them.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:02.820]  And then, you know, well, the other one is the the Apple music beyond Alexa. I mean,
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:10.660]  the Yeah, I mean that Yep. To me, that's a clear shift in strategy. I mean, the in frankly,
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:15.740]  to my mind suggests that HomePod sales are way worse than they expected. And that, you
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.300]  know, that was a real differentiator for Spotify is that if you have a Spotify subscription,
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:24.500]  it will work on the smart speaker that you already have. And Apple music did it. And
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:31.580]  you strategy is about making trade offs. And they were at first trading off Apple music
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:36.280]  to favor HomePod. And now it's the exact opposite.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:41.520]  But you brought up a thing in a recent piece that's in the show notes. It was and it was
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.700]  mostly about Apple and antitrust, which is a whole segment of the show I want to get
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:52.100]  to. So don't don't go into the antitrust stuff yet. But the third last third of it
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.300]  was basically sort of raising a flag about Apple services that that, that in some ways,
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.820]  one of the reasons that Apple has been so such a consistently great company is that
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:07.860]  their interests have always been aligned with their customers. And that Apple makes nice
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:14.020]  products, and customers want to buy them, and they do and Apple gets the money from
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:19.560]  them and they charge very healthy margins. And the people get a product they're happy
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:30.760]  with and Apple gets the money and, and the circle continues. Services is the the impetus
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:38.860]  of a services driven company is very different and leads to things like, you know, ad tracking
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.340]  and privacy invasive stuff. And I'm not saying Apple is going to go down that route. I really
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:49.180]  I hope not. But the motivation is suddenly there when it wasn't before. It was sort of
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:54.220]  like it was easy for Tim Cook to rail against privacy when Apple didn't have any any reason
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:59.220]  financially to to to to not hold people's privacy.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:06.900]  Yeah, it's a it's hard to say because I think there's an aspect of it depends how you monetize
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:12.420]  the service, right? If you're ad driven, by definition, you're going to have, you know,
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:17.460]  you like you, you need to collect data like your business depends on it. And, you know,
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:24.360]  I've long ago, noted that Apple talking about privacy, I labeled it a strategy credit, which
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.960]  is the opposite of a strategy tax. A strategy tax is where you sort of hurt one business
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.740]  to prop up another business. Apple music being a classic example, right? Apple music not
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:40.480]  being on the echo previously was a strategy tax that was paid, you know, to support the
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.380]  HomePod and, and inherent any businesses, if you're particularly if you have a hardware
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:49.980]  business and a service business, there's inherent tension there. And they're going to be sort
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:54.500]  of working across across concerns. The strategy credit, on the other hand is where because
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:58.380]  of your business model, you get something for free, like as long as Apple was making
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:04.540]  all their money by selling devices, they could criticize Google for for privacy. And it's
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:09.860]  not that their criticism was wrong. And it's not that they weren't right, that they their
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:14.660]  devices were better for privacy than Google's, but it didn't hurt them either, right? There
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:19.180]  was no, there was no injury to their business, there was no trade off being made. And again,
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:22.500]  that's not that's not to say it doesn't matter. It's not important. But it's, you know, worth
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:28.060]  noting when you're looking at it strategically, I think it gets a little trickier when you
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:31.220]  get into so it Apple's not going to be an ad business. So they have ads in the in the
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:36.020]  app store, but by and large, you know, they're not necessarily being an ad business in part
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:41.000]  because they won't cross these lines, which, which is fine, which is great. I think there's
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.020]  definitely a place in the market for that. The the challenge is when he gets to things
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:50.720]  like like iterative services, like, you know, to what extent does having a large corpus
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.740]  of data matter in developing some of these different, you know, machine learning based
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:59.520]  things, for example, and you there's disputes about it, do you need a lot is do you only
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.100]  need some, you know, but you know, and you can come down at different sides. But now
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.540]  it's getting a little bit closer to being a tax as opposed to being a credit where you
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:15.100]  might actually be hurting your business in order to maintain this sort of stance on things.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.520]  And and that's a more, again, it's not saying one way is right or wrong. But it's a more
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:26.180]  challenging sort of managerial decision than it was a few years ago.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:32.740]  Yeah, I think so. You know, one question I've had, and I still think it's unclear is how
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:38.380]  the hell is Apple I mean, Apple is undeniably working on on streaming original content,
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:46.540]  as they say, TV shows and, you know, movies. You know, this is they've they've announced
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.580]  it they had to this is something they can't keep secret because they make these deals
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:54.700]  and they get published, you know, you know, so that's coming, but nobody knows yet how
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:57.860]  the hell they're going to charge for it, or are they going to charge for it. And I know
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.500]  there was one I forget who published it, but there was one piece at some point last year
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.060]  where somebody said that they it would just be free, but it would be you know, it just
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:10.100]  be like you but you can only watch it on Apple devices. You know that if you have an iPhone
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:16.140]  and iPad, Mac or Apple TV, you could watch Apple's original content. And if you didn't
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:25.140]  it's going to be tough noogies. This deal at CES makes me think that's hard to believe.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:30.560]  It's obviously going to be on the Samsung TVs now. I mean, and I guess they could make
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.180]  it so that you have to have an iPhone or something to get started, you know, like to get signed
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:40.340]  in, you know, and so that's only you know, some way they could somehow more or less make
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:44.900]  it so that just because you have the Samsung TV, you can't watch Apple's original content
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:49.460]  without owning some other Apple product. But it seems unlikely to me. I've always thought
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:55.260]  that they, you know, to me the three main ways they could do it is they could just give
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:02.700]  it away free, which I think is unlikely. They could just make it part of Apple Music and
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:08.420]  either change the name or keep it called Apple Music even though you're getting TV shows
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:12.140]  on it. And that's sort of what they're doing now because like the carpool karaoke thing,
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:18.380]  I think you only get if you have Apple Music or they could just start a separate service
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:24.900]  and you'd have to get Apple Music and Apple TV the service. You'd have to pay to two subscriptions
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.980]  a month or maybe, you know, obviously the natural thing to do would be if they're both
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:33.980]  $10 a month for 15 you can get both. It seems a lot more likely to me that they're going
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:37.420]  to do something like that at this point. I don't I think this idea that they'd give it
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:43.340]  away free is not nutty, but it certainly doesn't isn't isn't the strategy. It's a strategy
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:47.100]  of a device company, not as not a services company. That's exactly right. And I agree
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:51.900]  with you that the the it seems pretty clear that it's going to be a broadly available
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:57.860]  sort of content, which, you know, I mean, I wrote I wrote an article a few years ago
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.620]  that they saying they should buy Netflix. And this is when Netflix is worth like $40
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:08.620]  billion or something. So it's a much different proposition. But yeah, I'm not sure like basically
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:15.660]  effectively competing with Netflix doesn't seem like a particularly fruitful strategy.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:20.220]  But we'll see. We'll see what happens. It's going to be very interesting to watch. I mean,
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:25.260]  yeah, I'm skeptical about the video stuff. I mean, with the caveat, I've been very skeptical
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.500]  all along. So there's probably a degree of confirmation bias here. But especially now
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:36.560]  to your point that it's very hard to see how it connects to their core business. It's Yeah,
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.500]  it's gonna be very interesting to see what it looks like, what the business model is,
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.740]  how they rolled out. Because it kind of feels like, well, let's do this thing that everyone
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:51.300]  else is doing making some money yet. Yeah. And, you know, there's only so many, you know,
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:55.400]  they go, I don't know what I think the phrase would be subscription fatigue. There's only
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:02.180]  so many things a month you're going to get people to sign up for. You know, and Netflix
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.940]  that you know, to their to their credit, you know, I think they have a pretty clear strategy
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:11.900]  on that, which is that if you're going to get one, it's going to be Netflix. I mean,
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:18.740]  I think if you looked at all the people who pay for some kind of original content subscription,
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:23.500]  if if you took all the people who only pay for one, I'll bet the overwhelming majority
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:29.860]  is Netflix. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, I think the one thing that I've always believed very
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:35.660]  strongly is that the shift I think what's happening with entertainment with video, it's
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:42.260]  a like there's a reorganization of the value chain. But I don't think that it's not gonna
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:47.420]  get cheaper, right? Like, I think that people were paying, you know, between 100 and $200
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:51.420]  for their entertainment needs 10 years ago, and they're gonna be paying that equivalent
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:55.660]  amount 10 years from now, I mean, adjusted for inflation or whatever. And it's just gonna
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:46:01.220]  the money's gonna be going to different different people. So I, I hear the point about subscription
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:07.060]  fatigue. But if you maybe stop paying for cable, or you get a skinny package, and then
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:12.020]  you spend that money elsewhere, I just don't see a world where suddenly people were paying,
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.460]  you know, $200 a month for their entertainment previously, and now they're only paying $50
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:22.580]  a month, I think that's very unlikely. Hmm. Yeah. And, you know, another sign of this
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:28.900]  from a few years ago is Apple Music for Android. You know, and it was easy to justify because
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:33.180]  it wasn't, it's not free, you know, everybody has to pay 10 bucks a month for Apple Music.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:39.700]  And so getting, you know, whatever the small percentage of Android users who do subscribe
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:45.100]  to Apple Music, you know, it's all icing on the cake, because they are at least paying
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:50.980]  $100 a month for Apple Music. Yeah, I mean, I think they had to do that too. You know,
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:54.940]  especially when Apple Music started, they were doing like an exclusive strategy, where
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:58.740]  there'd be stuff that's only on Apple Music. But I think that'd be a hard strategy. They've
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:02.460]  kind of abandoned that for now. But I think that'd be a hard strategy to do. If you only
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:06.620]  had, you know, 15% of the market or in the US, you know, 45% of the market or wherever
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:12.400]  it is. Yeah, I was taken by surprise by this Apple stuff with the TV set makers. And now
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.960]  that it's settled in after a couple days, I'm less surprised. I still don't have a coherent
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:25.340]  total explanation of it. So I haven't written much about it. You know, I think it's where
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:30.580]  growth is, like, I think they need growth. And the iPhone is what it is. It's not going
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:35.500]  anywhere. Again, I think to bet on it, you know, on Apple losing share or losing their
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:41.880]  position in the market is mistaken. But I think as far as revenue growth, it is probably
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:48.440]  mostly tapped out. And so I think that's probably underlying most of this is making more money
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:56.300]  from services is by far the, you know, it's kind of like we need to make more money everywhere
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.640]  because the iPhone is not going to happen. Because, you know, the wearables division
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.600]  is doing great. But that's not going to be the size of market of an iPhone. No. Well,
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.080]  and the thing that popped into my head only days later, but it should have popped in right
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:19.560]  away is the comparison to putting iTunes on Windows. Now, that was not about iTunes, the
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:25.600]  music store, it was fundamentally about the iPod, which was a device, you know, most of
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.080]  the money Apple made from that decision to put iTunes on Windows was made from selling
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:40.320]  iPods, not from selling music and TV shows. I think it certainly was, you know, at first,
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:48.360]  but it was about growth, even if it was at the expense of the whatever. Let's keep it
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:55.120]  all in the Apple family advantage there was to keeping the iPod Mac exclusive. You know,
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:01.200]  and I think it was there was sort of a similar whoa, Apple's going doing it for Windows,
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.360]  you know. And, you know, it was, you know, clearly the explanation was all it was all
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.320]  about growth. And it worked. It made it iPod sales skyrocketed, because there are all sorts
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.080]  of people who had no interest in switching from Windows to the Mac, who definitely wanted
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.080]  an iPod.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:21.160]  Yeah, it's probably one of the I think there was a lot of dispute within Apple with this
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.960]  isn't it right that Steve Jobs was opposed to it originally?
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.680]  I forget which book I forget which book that comes from, unfortunately. So I wish I could
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:34.600]  give credit, but it might have been Steven Levy's book on the iPod. But there was the
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.640]  story somewhere, but that it was like Phil Schiller, and I forget who else were on the
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.880]  side of look, we should do this, we should put this on Windows because we could sell
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:51.120]  a ton of iPods and we can get new customers, you know. And Jobs was reluctant.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:59.640]  That is the all-time greatest, I think, Apple strategic decision. People talk about making
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:05.160]  a phone that obsoleted the iPod, that's easy business, right? It's a more expensive device,
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:10.040]  you're making more money, right? That's not disrupting yourself. The real one was going
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:15.080]  to Windows. And what's so interesting, a lot of decisions are like this. In retrospect,
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.400]  it's so painfully obvious that was the right thing to do. But it really entailed sort of
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.720]  giving up on the heart of the company, right? I mean, Apple was the Mac. Apple and the Mac
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:31.440]  were synonymous. That's what they were. And you had to basically say, we have the first
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.760]  time we have something that could actually switch people from Windows to the Mac because
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.560]  we have this device that we can actually grow the Mac. And it's like, nope, you know what?
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.440]  Mac you're gonna have to do it on your own because there's something bigger here that
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.280]  we need to reach towards something larger. And that was the decision that weighed the
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.120]  groundwork for the iPhone. Because people forget the iPhone was a computer dependent
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:51:00.280]  device when it launched. So one, it had to work with Windows to reach the market it did.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:06.240]  But two, you already had people acclimated to Apple, used to using iTunes. They had all
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:11.440]  the pieces in place for the iPhone to happen. And the decision that mattered most of all
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.920]  for that was putting iTunes on Windows. Yeah, and I think the reason they deserve
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:23.680]  credit as a great decision is that it wasn't about a bad strategy versus a good strategy,
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:28.400]  which in hindsight is easy to say, well, yeah, they made the right decision. It was a good
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.280]  strategy versus a bad strategy. It was a strategy that was good for certain reasons on the one
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:38.120]  side that was diametrically opposed to the opposing strategy that was good for other
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:42.480]  reasons, right? It was good for the Mac that the iPod and iTunes were exclusive to the
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:47.000]  Mac. It was great for the Mac. And being great for the Mac was good for Apple. But it was
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:52.760]  just better for Apple overall to put it on Windows.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:59.000]  Yeah, I mean, Apple famously, you know, when they watch the iPhone, they changed the name
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.240]  of the company from Apple Computer to Apple Incorporated, you know, to sort of, which
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:07.560]  I think is, you know, honestly, when you think about the iPhone, it's still a personal computer.
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:11.880]  It's actually way more personal than any computer we've ever had. But, you know, there's
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.680]  a degree of symbolism there. But the moment that change actually happened was when it
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:23.760]  went to Windows. That's when Apple sort of ceased being a computer company and became
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:29.400]  something larger than that. And the name change was a trailing indicator in that regard.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:35.600]  All right, let me take a break and thank our third and final sponsor. It's our good friends

[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:41.840]  Of course, analytics, all of it built in. It's really literally all in one platform
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:47.400]  for building, hosting your own website. Let me say this. I think you, if you're on defense
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.200]  about it, you should have your own website. I think one of the ways the internet as a
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:57.080]  whole has gotten worse over the last decade is the way that, that we collectively have
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:02.320]  sort of outsourced our online identities to social networks and that we're just usernames
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:07.000]  on a social network and yet it doesn't replace it. Having your own website doesn't replace
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.120]  a presence on a social network, but it's something that you can own and it's all yours. I think
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.280]  that's just such an important part of branding. I think that there's so many people who are
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:21.640]  writing great stuff, but putting it on medium or something like that where they don't own
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.720]  it and they're not building any personal brand equity in it, whether it's a company or whether
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.820]  it's a person. I think having your own blog is such a great thing, even if you only post
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:37.200]  occasionally because you own it and you can control it in perpetuity and brand it visually
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.540]  to your identity. Squarespace is a great, great way to do that. Great way to start your
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.880]  own blog, your own podcast, something like that. And look, it's a new year. If one of

[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.680]  All right, we were talking about services, but I think that parlays into the last big
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.240]  ticket thing. At least I think it's the last big ticket thing on my list, which is
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:35.520]  Apple, the app store and antitrust. Why don't you give the background on this? Cause I think
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.200]  you're way more informed than I am. Well, the context to write about it is the
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:47.040]  Supreme court case that involves Apple, which is which is kind of a sidebar to I think the
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:56.220]  bigger issue. So the Supreme court case is can consumers sue Apple for antitrust with
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:56:02.200]  regards to the app store. And the, the argument that Apple makes is there's a, there's a doctor
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.760]  in antitrust, us antitrust law called the Illinois brick doctrine coming from a Supreme
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.280]  court decision called Illinois brick, Illinois brick company versus Illinois in 1977, that
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:16.860]  the only parties that can sue for antitrust violations are the ones that are directly
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:21.260]  injured. So in that particular case, uh, concrete brick
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:28.560]  makers were conspiring to raise prices and they would pass that price on to masonry contractors.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:32.560]  Masonry contractors were hired by general contractors and general contractors were hired
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.700]  by the state of Illinois to build schools or whatever it might be. And so the Supreme
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:40.720]  court ruled that Illinois could not sue. Only the masonry contractors could sue cause they
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.520]  are the ones that were directly injured. And part of this was sort of just administrative
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.320]  reason. Like how do you decide where the damage is distributed? You know, you don't want to
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.200]  have double jeopardy where you know, you get, you get multiple things. It was actually a
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.720]  relatively closely decided case. I think there was a fair bit of controversy about it, but
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.280]  it's sort of been the law of the land for, you know, 40 some years and Congress has had
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.960]  plenty of opportunity to change the law and they have declined to. So the, the, it's kind
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:12.080]  of like set. And so the question now is who is actually harmed by, by the app store and
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:16.400]  neither party is asking the Supreme court to repeal Illinois brick. It's just a question
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:22.120]  of who's harmed. So Apple is saying that developers are harmed. They enter a contract with us.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:27.760]  We take money from them and we're just a facilitator. We're providing a service for them to sell
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.620]  to consumers. The actual relationship is between developers and consumers, which means consumers
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:38.920]  can't sue us. They can only sue the developers and the, the, the, the, and it's important
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.360]  to note that the lawsuit was brought by users. It's people who, that's somebody who owns
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:47.600]  iPhones who's, they're suing Apple saying that we want to be able to get apps from other
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:48.600]  stores.
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:51.640]  Well, no, they're just saying that we, we shouldn't be, have to pay that 30% premium.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:57.120]  We're being overcharged. And and so the, the, the reason, so they haven't even talked about
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:02.480]  the antitrust issue yet. The only issue is can the lawsuit even go forward? So, so it's
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.200]  a, it's still like a preliminary sort of matter. Do the people suing have standing is the legal
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:14.760]  term? Are they the ones that can sue for this? And they're saying, no, we pay Apple. And
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.840]  so we are the ones that are harmed because we're paying Apple a 30% premium that makes
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:21.440]  things more expensive than they would be otherwise.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:28.600]  Yeah. So I think this is fascinating and, and, and I like to, I hold it up and, and
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.280]  this is one of the reasons that I really enjoy your writing and I love having you on the
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.800]  show is I often say, you know, that the only way to be right all the time is to be actually
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:42.880]  be correct most of the time and be, be looking for where you're wrong. Figure out why you're
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:46.800]  wrong and change your mind, you know, and that changing your mind. A lot of people don't
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.640]  change their mind on anything. You know, there's a lot of people who, if you say, what was
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:52.760]  the last thing, a big thing that you, you changed your mind on, they might have a hard
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:59.400]  time coming up with it. You've changed my mind on whether Apple has, has a antitrust
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.360]  problem with the app store. And we could talk about that in detail, but I think that, I
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:07.960]  don't know if irony is the right word, but I, I think the fact that it's coming to
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:13.520]  head with this lawsuit is kind of ironic in a way because I think the lawsuit is totally
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.640]  wrong headed. Like I think if Apple tomorrow said, okay, no more 30% just we'll, we'll,
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:27.280]  we'll charge 2.5% because that's the credit card transaction fee. So if you buy a $1 app
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:37.040]  will take a, you know, 2 cents, that's not going to lower the cost of apps by 30%. It's
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:40.840]  you're not, the users aren't, the user, there might be some, an argument for how
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:45.520]  you can say that users are harmed by the app stores exclusivity, but it's not pricing.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:52.080]  And it's, you know, like you have, you, you hang out on Slack with me with a bunch of
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:57.160]  independent developers. I mean, India developers, especially Mac developers, you know, the idea
[01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:04.400]  that, that the price of apps has been driven up by the iOS app store is ludicrous because
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:09.200]  they're all free and 99 cents if you have to pay anything, right? Like when it, until
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.680]  recently when, when apps were paid, they, you know, the price was quickly driven down
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:22.120]  to 99 cents, which is unsustainably low. It's a different type of monopoly if it's a monopoly,
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:27.240]  whereas the brick cases, classic antitrust where the prices were going up, they, they
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:33.200]  conspired to raise the price of the bricks at the, at the manufacturer's level. Then
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:37.360]  like you said, the masons had to pay more, which then the general contractors had to
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.120]  pay for more. And then the state of Illinois had to pay more to, to build the school because
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:49.440]  the bricks were art, you know, it was all about raising prices. You know, protecting
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:55.520]  against high prices. You and I have had this conversation on online and offline. You know,
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:03.280]  if anything, US antitrust law is, is almost fundamentally based now, at least on the entire
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.560]  point of it is about protecting customers from higher prices and there definitely are
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.200]  not higher prices in the app store. The app store prices are ridiculously low.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:17.560]  Yeah, I, I agree. And I think to me that's sort of the quenching factor where I think
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.520]  that Apple should, will and should win this, this case. There is definitely skepticism
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.960]  from the judges in the, in the oral hearings, but it seems to my eye that it's pretty clear
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:33.760]  that that's, that's the case. But at the same time, if you, if you back up and think about
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.960]  it, you know, Apple's point that developers have the relationship or developers sell to
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:45.160]  users and Apple is just sort of like a payment processor or facilitates it. Why doesn't that,
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:49.180]  why don't developers, why aren't they able to get them their users sort of account information?
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:53.740]  Why can't they give them refunds easily? Like why there's, there's actually very little
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:58.300]  about this relationship that, that set suggests it's any sort of a direct relationship between
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:04.400]  developers and users. And Apple certainly sits in the middle in every sense except for
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.400]  maybe the way the finances move. Like yet, like the, the, uh, yes, Apple doesn't like
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:15.240]  stock apps on their store. Like they're not a wholesaler, but that's the nature of digital
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:20.720]  goods is there is no, there is no stocking to be had. Right. I mean, so it's a, it's
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.560]  a challenging case because it'd be, again, if this were physical goods, it'd be very
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.200]  straightforward. Either Apple buys the goods from developers and sort of holds inventory
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.200]  and it sells them on or they don't. And, and they facilitate a transaction where the developer
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:38.840]  delivers it straight to the end user. But given that it's a digital good, the, the,
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:44.120]  there is no inventory to hold. So it's not really clear who's in the middle. And I, again,
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:48.880]  I agree that, uh, with you about this, the way this will probably play out and probably
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:58.200]  should play out. But I think Apple is, uh, they are very happy to stick themselves in
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.760]  the middle of the developer end user relationship in every single factor that actually matters.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.680]  Uh, but for this particular legal case, like, Oh no, we're just standing to the side facilitating
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.900]  a transaction, which that doesn't reflect the way that those relationships actually
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.360]  play out at all.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:21.160]  Yeah. And it's, it really is, it is, it, it seems like Sophie street argued that their
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.720]  relationship is not with the customer. I mean, you know, like you said, I mean, I think people,
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:30.520]  I don't even know we've, we, I know from talking to developers that typical users are shocked
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:35.080]  almost when they find out if they, if they do want a refund for reason X, Y, or Z and
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.580]  they contact the developer, uh, the developer literally has no mechanism to, to give somebody
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:45.560]  a refund. And people find this surprising cause it seems like they should, you know,
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.920]  uh, but they don't, you know, and what do you do? It's frustrating when you're a developer
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:55.080]  who's trying to give good customer support to users and you want to say, Hey, if for
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:59.120]  whatever reason you're not happy, I'd, I'd, I would give you a refund, but they can't,
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.200]  uh, they don't have much more relationship with the customer or any knowledge of who
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.920]  they are. Then like when, when you walk into a target, a brick and mortar store and I buy
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:12.560]  a Sony TV and I give target the money and I walk out the door with the TV, do I have
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.000]  a relationship with Sony or with target? It's clearly it was with target. I mean, Sony is
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.280]  going to get the money or already got the money from when stone, you know, target stock
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:27.920]  the TV and paid the wholesale costs. Um, but my relationship isn't with Sony. It's, it's,
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:30.680]  that's what the app store relationship is more, more like than anything.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:36.160]  Yeah. And not only that, but like Apple is very like forces you into, you have to offer
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:42.120]  your goods in a way that you don't necessarily know who the end user is. Like it's like there's
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:46.000]  a, there's a curtain there that you can't sort of break through. And even if you want
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.060]  to have sort of an account system, that account system has to be after the purchase. Well,
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:55.120]  you can't force someone to create an account and then do a purchase. You have to allow
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.040]  them to do the purchase and never create an account such that they're always anonymous
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:02.080]  to you. I mean, the pseudonymous, I guess is the right word cause you can track who
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:07.280]  they are so that, you know, but you can't know who they are and in what respect then
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.000]  does the developer have relationship with the end user? I mean the, the, the reality
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:17.920]  is that the, uh, according to the very narrow sort of reading, I think of Illinois brick,
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.200]  Apple's probably in the right here, but I think it's more a testament that Illinois
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:25.880]  brick is woefully, uh, insufficient for dealing with digital goods. So because we're dealing
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:31.480]  with a sort of relationship that's like Illinois brick, like envisioned a very sort of linear
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:36.920]  value chain where money went from a to B to C to D to E when the reality of a digital
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:40.920]  relationship, it's not just money, it's also the consumer relationship, it's data, it's
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:47.360]  all this sort of stuff where it's much more of a, a, a 3d or quantum sort of connection
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:57.840]  that to, to try and distill it to, to a series of boxes and arrows is, is woefully insufficient.
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:04.360]  But that is all to say, not that that is all to not say that Apple doesn't have a, I had
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:08.360]  too many double negatives there, but Apple has an antitrust problem perhaps with the
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:14.040]  app store. And, and again, I think the term that applies is rent seeking. Yeah, well rent
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:18.360]  seeking is, is a, uh, it's not necessarily an antitrust term per se, it's just the, the
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:26.320]  idea that a company or entity is collecting money based not on the provision of a service,
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:35.240]  but by, because the parties have no choice. Like, so if you, if you, I mean, you think
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:38.960]  about it in terms of rent, like if you own a piece of property and someone wants to send
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:44.460]  that property, you can extract money not by doing the activity that is generating money,
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:48.040]  but because you own the property on which is happening. Right. And that's legitimate
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:52.560]  in the case of like real estate because you need, like you need the real estate. It's,
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:58.120]  it's a little less legitimate, I think, particularly in terms of digital content. And you know,
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:02.000]  there's a discussion we had about apps buying apps and you know, to what extent does Apple
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.540]  provide the APIs and the platform and all those sorts of things that they're justified
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:12.720]  in taking that. I think that argument gets drastically shakier when it comes to digital
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:17.440]  content. If you want to buy, to take the classic example, and this was the, this was the last,
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:22.120]  the last app where you could buy digital goods in the app store was the Kindle app in 2011.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:29.440]  And Apple said, if you want to sell a book, if Amazon, if you want to sell a Kindle book,
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:33.960]  you have to pay us 30%. You have to use our purchasing system. You cannot, cause it used
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:40.040]  to be when the app store first launched the Kindle app, you could go to a web view. Again,
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:43.920]  you weren't using Amazon's payment system with like in-app purchase APIs. You would
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:48.000]  go, you would click on a button, you would go to a web view and you could click a button
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.160]  to buy it. And this is how it works on Android. By the way, if you use Kindle on an Android
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:57.120]  phone, there's a tab on the bottom, which is store that that page is not like an app
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:02.540]  page. It's not like a using APIs or whatever. It is actually a webpage. I think it actually,
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:07.220]  I do think that, that they did shoot you over to Safari. I don't think it was a web view
[02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:11.440]  in the app. I, you know, and I think that was part of the, that might be the case back
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:16.980]  in 2011. Yeah. Yeah. Were there even web views back in 2011? I think there, there always
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:21.080]  was a web view, but it was in it, but it was limited at the time. I don't know if I was
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.760]  a developer, I'd probably remember, but there was, there was a time a few years later where
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:29.740]  Apple significantly improved the web view, you know, and made it sort of like a mini
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:35.160]  version of Safari that had access to the same cookies and et cetera. But instead they shot
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:38.320]  you over to Safari. And in some ways that might've been better just because if you were
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:42.800]  already logged into amazon.com on Safari, you were already logged in when they shot
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:48.000]  you over and they knew it. There was like a callback so that when you did buy the book,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.660]  you could from Safari hit a button that would jump you back to the Kindle app to the book
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:58.200]  that was already downloading, you know, because they sent a push notification to the Kindle
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:05.360]  app on your phone, you know, so the long and short of it is, is that until 2011 you could
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:12.520]  buy Kindle books easily and in an obvious way, all on the phone with maybe at the most
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:18.240]  arguably one extra step compared to if the purchase had literally been in the app. That's
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:23.640]  right. And, and whereas now today, uh, you can download the Kindle app and you, there
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:28.240]  is no web view, there is no link. You can't even say that if you want to buy books, go
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:34.720]  to Kindle.com like you would have to know magically that I'm going to go open the browser,
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:38.800]  go to amazon.com, buy a book, then switch back to the app and do it. And for Amazon
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:42.640]  that works cause Amazon, everyone knows Amazon, everyone knows Kindle for Netflix. It works.
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:47.440]  Everyone knows who they are. If you're a small business, a content business, it doesn't work
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:54.160]  very well. And, and the problem I have is I've, I don't see in any respect the case
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:58.920]  in which an ebook is the smartphone market. Like I don't, this, this, this has nothing
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.560]  to do with the app, the smartphone markets. It is a book, it is a digital content. The,
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:12.520]  the phone is simply a device on which you view something and I find it, uh, extremely
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.960]  problematic and objectionable and, and not just from like a moral reason, but from like
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:23.960]  an innovation reason that Apple is, is forcing, is going to take 30% because they can like
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:28.840]  that. It is, it is rent sinking. They are taking 30% not through anything that they
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:33.160]  do, but simply because they can, uh, they made, they made the rules. There's only one
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:36.460]  app store. You have to follow this rule if you want to be in the app store. And because
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:41.080]  phones are like, we just talked about how incredible the phone is as a market. It is
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:45.600]  something everyone needs, right? And they are leveraging the fact that they control
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.920]  one of the two platforms for the device that everyone needs to basically take 30% on stuff
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.120]  they have nothing to do with. And I find it problematic morally and I think it's problematic
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  legally.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.640]  Yeah. Uh, and so the news on that front is that Netflix, uh, for those of you who haven't
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:06.540]  been paying attention, uh, Netflix has changed their iOS app to no longer do in app signups.
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.800]  So if you're a new, new to Netflix or if you stopped your Netflix and are coming back,
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:18.120]  if you start in an Apple app, iOS, iPad, or, uh, I guess Apple TV, I don't know if they've
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.420]  updated the Apple TV, but you can't create a new Netflix account. You used to be able
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:28.640]  to until like a week or two ago, you know, you could just sign in and use an in app purchase
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.920]  and they charge the same price. I think, you know, whatever, 10 bucks a month. Um, except
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:38.080]  that for people who signed up in the apps, it 10, you know, 30% of that went to Apple
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:43.200]  every month and 70% went to Netflix. Whereas if you signed up in your web browser with
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.160]  a credit card, you'd pay you, the user would still pay 10 bucks a month and all of the
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:56.220]  money would go to Netflix minus, you know, visa or Amex is two to 3%. Um, and so Netflix
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:12:02.600]  has made the obvious strategic change to go all in on that, but it is, I'm with you. I,
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:08.400]  I don't care if Apple takes things that the third, you know, and now they're for, for
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:12.800]  subscriptions, Apple, I don't know, a year or two ago announced that once a subscription
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:19.680]  is a year old, the 70 30 split changes to 85 15. So somebody who, you know, signs up
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:27.680]  for HBO now in the app, uh, you know, 70 30 split for a year. And then after that it's
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:33.120]  85 15. Uh, if Apple thinks those numbers are good, that's fine. I think it's their prerogative.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.000]  The part that I find objectionable and to borrow your description both morally and perhaps
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  legally, but certainly morally is the refusal to allow the app to tell you what's going
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.880]  on. Like one of the rules of complying with Apple's app store guidelines is that if you're
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:57.960]  not going to do in app purchases and you have to sign up outside to, to get them, the one
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:02.600]  of the rules is you can't tell the user the rules that you, you know, you have to go to
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.920]  the Amazon to amazon.com to buy the Kindle book, or you have to go to the comics ology
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:13.720]  website to buy the comic book, or you have to go to, uh, you know, netflix.com to sign
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.560]  up for Netflix. And it, it, when you really look at it, you look at the new Netflix, like
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:26.600]  I signed out or signed in on a, on a older iPad that I didn't use anymore. Um, it is,
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:30.360]  it's ridiculous that they don't tell you like, and so I really tried to put myself in the
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:35.200]  mindset of like, let's say an old, somebody who, you know, it's hard to imagine not having
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:38.800]  Netflix, but somebody who's like, all right, I've heard enough about this Netflix. I want
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:42.440]  to watch this bird box thing. Everybody's talking about our signup and they go to your
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.780]  iPad. It, it, it really looks like a bug almost that you can't, that the only option is sign
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:53.300]  in, right? If you, you've, you've just downloaded this app for the first time. Everybody you've
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:59.440]  heard about Netflix and you know, most things you do on your iPad, you, you, you know, you
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:04.480]  do everything on the iPad and with Netflix now you don't, but they, they have a button
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.920]  up in the corner help, which, which lets you make a phone call to Netflix. And I, I called
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:14.760]  it, which I'm glad I did. And if you ask them on the phone, they can tell you, they will
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.680]  tell you, Oh, you need to go, you need to go to your web browser and go to netflix.com
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:22.800]  and you can sign up there.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:28.680]  Which the challenge then is even that, like it's ridiculous, but that can a startup or
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.840]  can a new small company have like a call center? The, the, and not only that, but the, the
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:39.640]  insistence that you have to use the in-app purchase. Again, even if the percentages were
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:45.240]  much lower, the level of burden and complexity that puts on a new app, because now you have
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:49.440]  to support Apple and you also have to support something for the web and you have to support
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.680]  something different. Like you can't just have like one, one payment system. Like you, you're,
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:58.600]  you're forced into supporting multiple ones as if the world were, you know, we're only
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.720]  iOS, but that's, that's not the case.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.300]  Yeah. I, I really think that Apple should be able to, to whatever they decide the split
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:09.960]  should be 70, 30, 85, 85, 15, whatever they decide it should be, it should be able to
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.800]  compete on its own and that developers should choose. Well, that's, it's so convenient and
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.960]  so easy for the user to sign up right there in the app and just, you know, put their thumb
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:25.200]  on the touch ID button or use face ID and confirm, and now they're subscribed. It's
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.080]  so much, you know, I'm going to get so many more signups because of this. I'll, I'll agree
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:33.640]  to this 85, 15 or 70, 30, whatever.
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:38.680]  That's their choice, right? And if those numbers are too high, if 70, 30 is too much, you know,
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:42.000]  then it would naturally come down and they would adjust it. You know, like there, there
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.560]  is no market effect at work if, if they can unilaterally disallow developers from even
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.160]  choosing it while explaining to users how to go about it.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:55.840]  Yeah. And they could, and they would still be very successful. I mean, take like in app,
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:00.000]  take games, for example, like the, you, you don't, if you're a game developer and you're
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.840]  getting someone to buy a bunch of virtual coins or whatever it might be, you, you probably
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:07.800]  want to kick them out to a web browser because you're breaking the spell, you're getting
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:13.040]  out of it and it's, you're like, do I really want to spend this money? You want the convenience
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.520]  and the speed of that transaction. It's a huge benefit. And Apple, you know, I'm not
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.960]  saying that Apple has to open up their in app purchases to other payment processor.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:26.320]  Like they innovated that they built that by all means you should be able to, you should
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:30.880]  be able to compete on those grounds. I have no objection to that. And frankly, there's
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.840]  a huge benefit to being tied in with Apple. The number one thing of the number thing that
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.520]  drives churn for Chachere, for example, is credit cards expiring like that. And people,
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.480]  they expire and they don't notice for a while and they may, they're going to sign up, whatever
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.400]  it might be. Well, guess what? Guess which credit card is the first credit card to get
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.680]  changed. If your card expires or if your card gets stolen, you go and you change your iTunes
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.560]  card right away because you're more likely to realize it's expired fast, right? That's
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:04.280]  a huge benefit for a developer to be, to have someone else basically policing the remembered
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.320]  update your credit card problem. Cause that's by far one of the biggest drivers of churn
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.840]  for anyone that, that relies on credit cards. So like there's real benefits to going with
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.040]  Apple and where I think they could absolutely charge a premium and rightly so. This idea
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:23.420]  though that Apple deserves 30% of a Kindle book, which by the way would never happen
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:29.040]  in books because you're paying, like there are, I've, I heard a lot from people running
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.560]  ebook stores or ebook things that were not Amazon that this is devastating for them because
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:41.240]  they're paying out 80% of, of, of, of, of a book price. Like they, it's literally impossible
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:46.400]  for them to use in app purchases because they'd be eating 10% on every purchase. And what
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:50.520]  did Apple have to do with the publishing of that book? What did they have to do with,
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:56.160]  with anything? All they did was make a device with a screen that is integral to, to daily
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:02.400]  life and to think that entitles them to, to book revenue or to music revenue or to whatever
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:08.260]  revenue might be, I think is, is preposterous. Yeah. And it's hostile to users. I really
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:13.720]  do think so because it leaves when, when the developer like Netflix chooses not to, to
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.080]  participate or all of Amazon's properties, you know, that have consumable content or
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:24.240]  subscription content, it is confusing. It is really, really confusing. And I, that,
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.920]  that is the antithesis of the Apple experience to be, you know, to leave users in a confused
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.520]  state. It really does not look like, and, and you know, the fact that you can't link
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:38.160]  or have a button that jumps you over to Safari to do it. I mean, I really do think that should,
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:40.920]  that should be allowed. And I don't even think, I don't even think there should be a question
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:45.040]  about it, but the fact that, all right, even if you say you can't have a link, but you
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:49.840]  can't even tell them like, you can't even say, go to netflix.com and not have it be
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.500]  not even have it be at link, but that's just, again, that's absurd, but it's even more absurd
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:57.040]  to say that you can't even tell them that that's what you have to do.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.160]  Yeah. And I just think there's no defense for Apple here. I mean, the, the def and believe
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.640]  me, I've heard, I've heard all the objections from, from, from the Apple supporters that
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:09.960]  like, well, it would be better for the user if everything was in that purchase. It's like,
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:17.600]  like, we're not in that world. One and two, again, on what it's to understate, I think
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:25.360]  the importance and of a phone, right? The phones are, we live the look at how the world
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.680]  is transformed by this device. That's the reason why Apple makes so much money on the
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.640]  devices because they're so integral and important. And by definition, if they're so integral
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:39.080]  and important, they are essential to, to the economy. They're essential to innovation.
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.400]  They're essential to new things coming forward. And it's, it's, it's a society. I think it's
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:53.180]  problematic that, that one company can basically again, rent seek on an entire new world of
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:57.440]  digital content. And let me be clear, I'm super biased on this because I am in the digital
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:04.480]  content business, right? And you know, I, I don't have an app and if I had an app, I
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:09.280]  would be forced to deal with this conundrum. So I, I'm certainly biased, but I'm also a
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:13.920]  huge believer in the potential of there being all kinds of new businesses, all kinds of
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:19.020]  new opportunities to do things online, to do things that weren't possible previously.
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:25.160]  And I don't see in any respect in which these sort of rules and limitations are making that
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.840]  future more likely to happen. They're making it less likely to happen.
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:33.680]  Yeah. And it gets back to the services narrative where Apple's drive to increase the revenue
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:38.720]  it makes from the app store is in some ways at odds with the user experience. I mean,
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:42.200]  and you know, one of the ways it would be better if everything was an in-app purchase
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:47.760]  is the fact that Apple has, in my opinion, a very good interface for seeing, Hey, what
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:53.040]  subscriptions am I paying for through iTunes? And then you can see them and you can unsubscribe
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.280]  from them right there and there's nothing the company can do about it. You know, that's,
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:01.640]  that's the way it is. So from a user experience perspective, it'd be great if more subscriptions
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.520]  went like that because they're in one central place where you can see them all get a better
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:11.320]  sense of like what you're spending per month overall on these subscription stuff. And you
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:15.640]  can unsubscribe easily. I mean, I always bring it up because to me, it's, it's like the best,
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:19.240]  the most amazing counter example. Like if, if you want to unsubscribe from the New York
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:22.080]  Times, you have to call them on the phone.
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:25.240]  That's ridiculous. It's so infuriating. And the other thing is that you're chasing me
[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:30.200]  so much about is that when they won't tell you the price, they're like, it's $1 for eight
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:32.440]  weeks. It's like, well, how much is it after it?
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:38.520]  Yeah, it's ridiculous, right? Like Apple's rules make it yeah, the Apple, Apple a makes
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:42.520]  it easy to unsubscribe. And they also, you know, make it impossible to obfuscate what
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:49.480]  you'll be paying on on what basis. It's all great, but in the user's interest, it would
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.080]  therefore be in in Apple, it would it would therefore, it would be better for the users
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:22:01.440]  than if Apple priced its cut for these in app subscriptions, such that companies like
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:04.760]  Netflix and Amazon and booksellers could agree to them.
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:10.680]  Well, that's why that's also why that's a vector Apple can compete on, right? Like if
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:16.080]  if people asking for digital subscriptions are being scammy about it, then what's the
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:20.600]  solution is a market based solution where consumers decide not to subscribe to them.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:27.440]  And or they are forced to offer an Apple in an app purchase solution that that's a consumer
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:30.560]  can say, Look, I'm not gonna subscribe to you unless you offer an app purchases because
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:36.880]  I trust Apple to handle this better than you. Like that's that's the mechanism to for Apple
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:42.240]  to compete on by we're better and more trustworthy consumers think, you know, trust us. It's
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:48.120]  not to decree by fiat that this is the way it's going to be. And we're going to justify
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:52.680]  it. But it's not that what you're saying is not true. But that's a that's a reason
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:23:00.280]  to compete or a way to compete. It's not a justification for basically taking 30% because
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:02.760]  we can, which is, you know, the reality now.
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:08.680]  All right. Yeah, there's there's no market pressure really on Apple to to adjust or lower
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:14.440]  its price. I mean, and, you know, they have in some sense with the thing I mentioned before
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:22.200]  where where year old year plus old subscriptions are 8515 instead of 7030. But for the most
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:27.720]  part, the rate has stayed unchanged since the App Store opened up. And that's a little
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:35.960]  ridiculous because the difference in convenience between paying in app in 2008, versus now
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:42.180]  and 10 years later, it it's not as big a difference, right there. It was a lot more convenient
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:49.720]  back then compared to paying manually than it is now in a web view or whatever.
[02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:54.400]  Yeah. Well, but not just that, but, you know, there will always be advantages to it. And
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:24:00.200]  but it's also the yes. People will say the market pressure is Netflix taking it out.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:05.320]  Right. But the problem is that the only companies that can do that, that can exert that pressure
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:10.120]  are other very large and powerful companies that are very well known. And by the way,
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:14.680]  Netflix had a favorable rate for a lot longer than Apple doing that. Like that was more
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:18.560]  Apple giving the Netflix rate to everyone else because Netflix previously threatened
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:22.680]  to leave the store. Right. But here's the problem. That's not market pressure. That's
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:28.240]  big company fighting. If you're a little guy, you don't get to exert that sort of pressure
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.480]  on Apple. Apple doesn't give doesn't care if you're not. You don't get it. You don't
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:37.720]  get a meeting with any Q. Right. And in Apple, this is this is why it bothers me. Just I
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:42.480]  think it's bad for society because it's the little guys that are getting hurt here. It's
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.880]  it's the gal that doesn't that doesn't even create an app. It doesn't even create a service
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:53.520]  because that it's too it's too it's too much or it's too much of a hassle. Again, this
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:59.120]  idea that the other the other thing that people don't consider is because you have to use
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:04.120]  Apple's in-app purchases. That means you have to build at least two payment systems for
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:08.720]  it for a new app or service because you need one for Android and the Web. You can use the
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:12.280]  same one friend or in the Web because Google allows it. But you still have to have a different
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.560]  one for Apple. And now you have to you have two different revenue streams to figure out
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.040]  and mix them together. You have to your bookkeeping's way more complicated. It is increasing the
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:26.560]  the entry for for innovation and for creating something new. And that that's a bad thing.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.840]  And Apple will go on and on about all these new jobs they create and the new things they
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.080]  created the App Store. And that's all that's all true. I'm not denying any of that. But
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.880]  now we're no longer in like the world where the iPhones coming along where the world where
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:42.160]  the iPhone exists, where smartphones exist and they are inescapable. You can't build
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:47.480]  a business and not be on a phone like it is the most important computer computing platform
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.640]  there's ever been. And for digital platforms, it's the only platform that matters. And that
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:58.360]  makes it even more important that there not be anti-competitive policies like this, given
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:01.600]  its importance to kind of society broadly.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:08.200]  Yeah. And it's, you know, like if you buy, I mean, people don't buy apps anymore. I mean,
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:14.560]  I know it's all going subscription, but you know, but you buy an app and Apple gets their
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.080]  cut one time. And then if you keep using the app, you keep using the app or not. But the
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:22.120]  idea, you know, like, and one of the things that makes Netflix is pulling out of this
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:29.080]  remarkable is that Netflix is the top grossing app in the store. That, you know, it obviously,
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  obviously enough people were signing up, you know, did their signups through the app store
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.000]  that it's the top grossing app in the store. I mean, I guess it's not surprising if you
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:41.880]  think that Apple is making 15% off of all these Netflix subscribers. And Netflix, of
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.120]  course, is super popular, that there'd be enough of them that would make Netflix the
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.880]  top grossing app in the store. But it's really hard to argue that Apple deserves 15% of those
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:56.480]  numbers for forever, forever in perpetuity for years to come. And obviously, it will
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:00.600]  be years to come because Netflix isn't going anywhere. And, you know, part of the whole
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:04.920]  Netflix point is it's just new new subscribers, they haven't like canceled the subscriptions
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:10.640]  of everybody who signed up in iOS. So Netflix may well remain the top grossing app in the
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.800]  store for years to come. Yep. Even though they no longer allow people to sign up. Yep.
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:19.280]  Like that's kind of crazy. Like the fact that Netflix is, you know, a year from now might
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.960]  still be and I wouldn't bet against it might still be the top grossing app in the App Store,
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.800]  because all of you know, I don't think people cancel their Netflix very frequently. I think
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:33.700]  there's enough, you know, so I think it'll keep going. It just shows how it's ridiculous
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:38.880]  to argue that Apple quote deserves that money when Netflix can stop taking it and just on
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:45.440]  the basis of years old signups still be paying all that money. Yep. And you know, it's it's
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:51.480]  it's concerning because the this isn't going to change because we just went through the
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:57.080]  entire thing where hardware revenue is in a hard place, which means the services narrative
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:01.060]  is super important. And you saw that in Cook's letter. He really emphasized the services
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:06.280]  aspect and emphasized the fact the install base is growing. And as I noted a little bit
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:10.100]  ago, the the the install base growing. The reason that matters because it means more
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:16.480]  services revenue and which means Apple is not going to back down here. And that is understandable
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:22.560]  strategically. It makes it it worries me tremendously as an observer of the company. Like if this
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:30.180]  is how you're going to make money is by again, it's rent seeking by by taking money from
[02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:38.000]  activities that you had nothing to do with just because you can. That is a I worry that
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.800]  can have a corrosive effect on Well, and, and the flip side of it, I wanted to make
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:46.640]  this point before we stopped. And I'm glad I thought of it. But the flip side of it is
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:50.360]  on the other side, I'm in agreement with you that, for example, in app purchasing in a
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:56.560]  game to buy, you know, boxes of coins or whatever the hell you buy. I do think that Apple, you
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:01.040]  know, I think it makes sense that even if it were only an option, that the game developers
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.240]  would still use Apple system and still pay apples 30%. Because of the, you know, like
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:09.560]  you said, if you leave and go to Safari, all of a sudden, it's a moment to think, Wait,
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:13.520]  do I really want to spend 10 bucks on this? Or, you know, why don't I just stay in Safari
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:19.640]  and see what the hell's going on in during Fireball. But But that means that Apple is
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:27.940]  in a position where they benefit tremendously from this whole in app purchasing of games
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:31.560]  and consumer, you know, consumables, you know, like you, what do you what do you call it
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:37.480]  pay to win, right? Yep. That you have to pay to win the game or to keep going, you know,
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:47.120]  whether you, you know, that it I don't think that's a good. I think it's very morally questionable
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:53.500]  business model. And Apple is in a position of benefiting quite a bit on this on particularly
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:58.080]  in the area where they're, they're directing analysts to look like, look at our services,
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:01.680]  look at our services, that's the one that they're telling everybody to look at. And
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:10.640]  they services to some degree benefits from the unhealthy world of pay to win games, you
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:16.580]  know, so on the one hand, they're taking money from like Netflix, that they, you know, arguably
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:22.080]  don't deserve. And then where they do deserve it, it's, it's not a very, it's questionably
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:23.080]  immoral.
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:30.000]  Yeah, well, and then I think the other piece is stuff like, like I quotes, I call it storage
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:34.960]  being five gigabytes, right? That's, that's a terrible user experience. And you see Google
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:38.760]  leveraging that against that, right? They run ads for Google Photos, that has the pop
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:43.800]  up of your out of your out of storage, right? And, and but, you know, getting getting that
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:47.080]  getting that every month is is is apparently hard to give up.
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:51.800]  Yeah, yeah, I know. It's, it's funny, because I never saw that dialogue, because I'm an
[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:55.640]  idiot, and I buy the biggest iPhone every time. And so I've got plenty of space on all
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:31:00.080]  my iPhones. But once they started showing it, and you know, and it's, it is definitely
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:07.400]  an iOS dialogue. It makes me realize that it surely is a common experience for a lot
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:08.400]  of people.
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:17.700]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And all this stuff is making it hard for people to, I think,
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:22.480]  I think it is a policy that kills innovation. I think to the extent that you know, big companies
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:29.160]  go outside to your point, it makes the user experience ridiculous and confusing. It, it
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:32.540]  hurts the performance as far as the storage thing goes, you know, that you don't have
[02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:35.660]  everything backed up, you don't have everything restored. I mean, remember, Apple was all
[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:38.600]  about backup, they did time machines, like, wouldn't it be a shame if your computer crashed
[02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:42.480]  and you lost all your photos, right? Well, wouldn't it be a shame if you lost your phone,
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:46.520]  and you lost your photos, because you didn't, you didn't pay for enough storage or whatever
[02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:53.360]  it might be? I mean, the, the, the, what happened to the user? What happened to this, you go
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:57.140]  with Apple and everything's taken care of? Well, you go with Apple and everything's taken
[02:31:57.140 --> 02:32:03.480]  care of, if you pay a lot extra, or some amount extra per month. And oh, by the way, there's
[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:06.880]  things that aren't going to happen, you're not going to get because we made, you know,
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:09.040]  we made entry too difficult.
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:16.280]  Yeah, and you know, I wonder too, how much that even plays into backfiring, even on iPhone
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:20.040]  sales, like how many people are reluctant people who say are on the free tier, so they
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:25.400]  don't have their whole photo library backed up. And they know that they've got tons of
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:29.640]  photos and videos that they care about on the phone that aren't backed up anywhere.
[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:33.460]  And yeah, I know, you can go buy a new iPhone and go to the Genius bar. And if you explain
[02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:37.600]  it to them, and you know that, you know, I don't, you know, I don't have iCloud backups,
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:42.920]  because they don't fit that they'll, they'll do the backup on a Mac right there at the
[02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:46.960]  bar for you and help you. But I don't know if people know that that's even possible.
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:50.040]  Like how many people just vaguely in the back of their mind are like, I don't want to get
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:53.640]  a new phone because I don't feel like I don't know, I'm worried that I might lose my photos.
[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:59.640]  Yeah, I mean, it has to be some number of people. And then therefore, it's affecting
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:03.860]  the upgrade cycle. I mean, I honestly don't think that that's I don't think I'm jumping
[02:33:03.860 --> 02:33:08.960]  through contortions to imagine that there are people like that. I it as somebody who
[02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:13.040]  cares about digital data and knows how important backups are. It terrifies me how many people's
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:17.800]  iPhones aren't backed up. Yeah, just people are gonna people are gonna bring this up.
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:22.120]  Like photo stream does not count against your your data. But you're limited on the number
[02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:25.920]  of photos that are in the photo stream. Like if you want all your photos backed up like
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:30.640]  that that is going to count that is going to count as your data. Yeah, yeah. And you
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.840]  know, and it's otherwise tricky, or people don't know how to move everything that you've
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:39.400]  got on your old phone to your new phone, you know. And you know, the fact that people lose
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:45.840]  phones, people destroy phones. You know, there's all sorts of, you know, go on and on and on
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:50.760]  about the importance of backups. But it's, it's tragic that more iPhone users don't have
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:55.280]  their phones backed up in iCloud, which is the easiest and old and in my opinion, for
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:58.760]  the typical user, by far the most reliable way to back up your phone, because it's not
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:03.440]  up to you to make sure your iTunes is working and your computer's in good working order.
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:07.120]  Because, you know, it's all on on Apple's part. Yeah, you don't have to do anything
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:12.560]  on a regular basis. And I don't know to the extent to which, I mean, there's lots of talk
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:16.360]  about Silicon Valley companies in general and being large and should there be antitrust
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:22.560]  and should companies be broken up, etc, etc. And I, you know, if, to my mind, the clearest
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:27.280]  single bit of anti competitive behavior in the valley is Apple. It is not close. I mean,
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:32.640]  can you imagine back in the day, if Microsoft had insisted on taking 30% of every of every
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:36.800]  app out of Windows, I mean, this is far more egregious than anything that Microsoft tried
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:40.760]  to pull off. And, you know, and people will point other examples at what about Google?
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:45.580]  Well, Google, you can kick out to a web page. What about Steam? Steam takes 30%. Well, you
[02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:50.480]  can install games outside of Steam. There are competitors to Steam. Like that's the
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:56.080]  equivalent of having multiple app stores, right? And like, there's really nothing like
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:02.600]  this in tech that is just so egregious. It's really, when you back up and think about it,
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:07.720]  and you realize that the digital goods market is different than the smartphone market. This
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:14.080]  is quite blatantly leveraging their position, the smartphone market into taking money out
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:19.540]  of the digital goods market. And it's, I don't know, it bothers me. And I think it hurts
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:23.560]  innovation just as much as, you know, Facebook and Google being large and dominant, taking
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:28.880]  all the advertising money hurts innovation. Like it's not good for anyone. The general
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:34.600]  number of tech right now is so stagnant in my mind, in large part because of how dominant
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:37.840]  these companies are and these sorts of policies.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:45.440]  Yeah. That's a good closing thought. I appreciate it. This is a great episode. We mentioned
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:53.000]  it at the outset, but anybody who forgot because it was quite a bit ago, your podcast Exponent.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  Yes. Stratechery, my writing in one article is free a week and then there's four pay and
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:05.120]  then Exponent, my podcast is back. It was gone. I just needed a little bit of a break,
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:09.380]  but it is back. So you can check that out as well.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:14.480]  And that's at Exponent.fm. You've been on a roll on Stratechery. I mean, you've been
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:18.240]  good ever since it started, but I feel like the last couple of months have been really
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:23.080]  good. A couple of really good pieces, including your take on the Apple, which we've kind of
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.960]  rehashed here, but the Apple earnings thing and your year in review is a good one too.
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.800]  Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:32.960]  Was that a free one? That's the one thing I sometimes I get confused is what was a pay,
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:37.720]  what I got as a paid daily update and what was a column. Year in review was a column,
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.720]  right?
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.040]  Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was, it was free. Yeah. Like everything's a trade off, right? And
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:46.320]  that's one of the trade offs that comes from having some stuff be free and some stuff not
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:49.280]  is people almost become hesitant to promote it because they're worried about promoting
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.520]  the wrong thing. But you know, that's, that's the reality of business. You got to make trade
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:58.120]  offs. So, but yes, that is free. If you go on the page, you have the Apple piece and
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.840]  then the one before it is the year in review, which is all the pretty good overview of everything
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:06.640]  I wrote in the, in the last year, what was the most popular, which ones I thought were
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.160]  particularly meaningful. And then I believe the article before that is, or a couple of
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:15.680]  ones before that is the, is the Apple, the Apple antitrust one.
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.960]  Yeah. We didn't even get into the damn Mac book keyboards.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:25.200]  Oh, do you want Dieter? I was doing one of your commercial breaks. Dieter Bodge posted
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:31.240]  from the verge, posted one of his coworkers at CES with a portable Bluetooth keyboard
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:36.800]  sitting on top of her Mac book because her space bar stopped working. I mean, I feel
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.760]  this, like I travel and I am constantly low key nervous about my computer suddenly not
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.840]  working. I mean that it's ridiculous that that is even, would even cross my mind of
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:52.320]  being something. And frankly, it makes me want to buy it. No, I, if my, if my computer
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:56.260]  ever suddenly stopped working, I would probably go buy a windows computer. I'm dead serious.
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:38:00.920]  Like I don't care how much I'm used to Mac OS and I know you were complaining about it
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:04.400]  on Daring Fireball this week. So I want to open that, that can of words about windows,
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.640]  but literally having your, your keyboard suddenly stopped working is ridiculous. And it's just
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:16.120]  absurd. When you'd be more likely to get a Chromebook. No, I mean, so I actually haven't
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:19.280]  used Chromebooks in a while. I love Chromebooks. I think they're a great experience. The pixel
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:25.840]  book, I check it, I wrote a lot of it on pixel. The big problem I had was the, the lack of
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.880]  like a clipboard history. It just wasn't possible. I'm not, that might be possible on Chromebooks
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:36.120]  now. I'm not sure, but literally that was the number one reason why I couldn't keep
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:41.400]  using, I couldn't keep using the Chromebooks, but I do like Chromebooks. That's one of the
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:45.200]  top reasons I can't, whenever I try using an iPad for an extended period of time, the
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:49.640]  lack of a clipboard history is such a deal breaker. For those of you who don't know,
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:54.080]  if you want to take away a tip, do a tips and tricks segment, find yourself a clipboard
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:00.000]  history app for the Mac and try it. And there's so many like a keyboard maestro has one. I've
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.560]  got like three apps running at all times that offer it as a feature. I have to choose which
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:09.800]  one. A launch bar has one. I'll bet Alfred has one. Payspot is actually the one I use
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:14.280]  because it's dedicated clipboard manager. And the basic idea is everything you can set
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:20.020]  it to say, remember my last hundred copies. And so the last hundred things you've copied
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:24.360]  are all remembered. And then there's a system wide keyboard shortcut that you can invoke
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:32.840]  to show you a list of them and search them. And it is, once you get used to it, it is,
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:37.760]  it feels like going to the 18 hundreds to go back to once you copy something, the previous
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:43.640]  thing you had copied is gone. It, it, it is a game changer. And for me and you write things
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:47.640]  and we put a lot of links in like going to safari and going copy, copy, copy for three
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:53.600]  URLs and then going back to the writing environment and paste, paste, paste to get the three things.
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.120]  The idea that you'd have to go back and forth between the two apps is crazy. And I know
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.560]  there's some utilities that iPad that kind of let you, but it's not as automatic. Like
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.760]  the thing about the Mac one is that it's just automatic. Every time you hit command C it's
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:07.760]  in your clipboard history.
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:11.160]  Yep. That's, that's exactly right. I, and I, I think I remember looking at Chrome OS,
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.080]  I think there, it might be possible now, but it's not the like just using keyboard shortcuts
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:19.720]  super fast. Everything's super automatic. That's yeah, no, that, that, that, that's
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:25.000]  exactly right. No, I would, I would get, no, I would get a, my wife got a for various reasons,
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:32.600]  got a, a surface laptop. It's nice. It, I mean, it's, it's, it, the hardware is beautiful.
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:36.200]  The, is that the one, is it the one that's all metal? It's not the one with the fake
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:41.320]  leather, right? No, it does have the fake leather, which I thought, which, which actually
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:45.980]  in use is not nearly as objectionable as I thought it was. And she has the blue one.
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:51.400]  So it's like this, it's this blue metallic, like when it's closed, it is gorgeous. Like
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:56.000]  it's a really good looking machine. I was really impressed by it. You know, obviously
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.240]  it's still Windows, whatnot, but the keyboard works great. The trackpad is, is matte quality.
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.400]  Like that was always a big objection I had to all windows laptops. The trackpad seemed
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:09.800]  to always be terrible. It's, it's a nice machine. Well bizarre for, for whatever bizarre reason
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.820]  of all the things that Microsoft was always been good at is they've always been good at
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.640]  input devices. They're there. They got into the business selling mice and keyboards long
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:21.000]  ago and it seemed so crazy at the time. Like why the hell is Microsoft making mice and
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.600]  keyboards? Their mice were always excellent. Excellent. I used a mouse for a while and
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:29.560]  their keyboards. And that was the thing with, we were, they did my liking, but they were
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:33.500]  very good. Even when they did the surface from day one, the, the trackpad was always
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:36.860]  good because that always drove me up the wall with windows laptops is the trackpad was always
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:42.840]  bad. And then Microsoft, even V1, the trackpad was great. So apparently I don't know if
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:47.440]  people are just cheaping out or what. I mean the, the Microsoft computers are expensive.
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:52.360]  Like they are, they're not making any bones about it. Like they are very much Apple, Apple
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:56.880]  prices. And I think probably with the trackpad, it was a matter of you get what you pay for
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:02.720]  and it has a really good trackpad. And, and by the way, having touch is really nice. You
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:07.340]  know, I think the things that, the mistake people make about, about touch is no one's
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:12.100]  using touch all the time, but it's like every now and then it's just easier to touch something
[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:17.560]  than to, than to, than to click on it. And it's like an all or nothing sort of thing.
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.920]  And yeah, you know, my wife's very happy with it.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:25.560]  My windows observation, my son got a gaming PC for those of you who didn't pay attention
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:32.960]  and, and helped him set it up over Christmas. So I hadn't seen windows in like 15 years.
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:36.560]  I mean, I've seen it, but I've never actually, I tried to do anything like just connect a
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:42.280]  computer to wifi or something like I did. And it's horrendous. It is in my opinion,
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:45.880]  worse than ever because it's like whatever windows 10 does is actually just a veneer
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:49.800]  over windows seven and windows seven is just a veneer. And if you poke around and keep
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:55.120]  hitting advanced settings enough, you eventually get the, all the stuff from windows XP. It's,
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:56.120]  it's all still there.
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:01.400]  Yup. No, this has always been windows blessing and curse, right? Like the, it will still
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:06.160]  run everything that has ever been written because of that. But like there's a definite
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:10.760]  trade off involved and yeah, the, uh, it, no, it, so my observation was that I would
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:15.680]  rather retire from using computers than use a windows. The other thing that I really dislike
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:18.880]  about windows is they're much better about switching languages and they used to be, but
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:23.000]  you have to log out and log back in. Whereas with a Mac, you can just switch like when
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.040]  you in a Mac, if you switch the language, the finder will always be in the language
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.040]  that it booted up into.
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.700]  But if you quit an app and restart the Apple, it will be in the new language. And so my
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:36.280]  wife or computers in Chinese. And so I was trying to do settings and you're right. The
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.560]  like the settings, the settings area is a bit of a disaster as is, and then once you
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:44.240]  start digging deeper, it gets worse. So you ha I have to have an English to get it set
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:48.080]  up. Like I'm not going to figure it out. And then I have to walk out and log back in.
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.000]  Oh, it's a, it's a big pain.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.800]  And the start menu, my God, it's like an entire operating system in the start menu.
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:00.200]  That's kind of what it is. That's what, that's where windows eight ended up.
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:06.120]  That is the craziest thing I've ever seen. And my son has a, we got him a four K display.
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:10.760]  So in theory it's, you know, quote unquote retina, but there's certain apps and windows
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:16.400]  are like effectively retina. You know, like using four pixels to render one dot, you know,
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.800]  so you, everything looks fine. Other things though are like one to one. So it's just like
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:26.200]  the tiniest text you could ever friggin imagine. Like literally using one pixel on the display
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:30.320]  as a, as a stroke of the letter.
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:33.680]  Yeah. It's too bad. I mean, if you go back, I mean, I say this as someone that worked
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:38.320]  there during the windows eight era. So, um, to whatever smallest responsibility I have,
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:44.360]  I apologize. But windows seven was actually a really solid operating system. Like if there
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:47.840]  were little things in the, its appearance that drove me up the wall, like that, this
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:51.280]  weird to like highlighting in the menu bar and stuff like that. But like it generally
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:56.560]  worked and it worked well and it was predictable and sort of understandable. And you know,
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:02.760]  I think windows, like the whole Metro UI, which took pictures really, really well, but
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:07.200]  I think from a usability standpoint was not great. Uh, it would be kind of nice if they
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:11.720]  could kind of rewind that and if they add, cause right now, yeah, that whole start menu
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:15.040]  is basically trying to scram that in there. And the reason why the settings are such a
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:21.360]  mess is because that's like that new UI and it didn't get translated everywhere. And if
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.200]  windows could just be windows seven, but evolved since then, but that the same general aesthetic
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:30.560]  and design, which again, it's, I'm not saying it's a wonderful designer aesthetic and you
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.520]  know, I'm not saying you should like it, but it was, it was predictable in a way that,
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:39.800]  uh, windows 10 is much better than it used to be, but it's, it's, it's, I think they're
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:42.000]  in a definitely a worse place because of it.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.760]  No, I don't know how unique I am. I mean, it's obviously my career is a privileged position
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:53.280]  where I can only use, I only have to use whatever devices I want to use, but uh, man, if anybody
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.080]  else out there has not used windows in like 10, 15 years, you really should, should sit
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:45:59.080]  down and try it.
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:03.840]  Yeah. I worked at Microsoft, so I had a few years of using windows and honestly, once
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:09.180]  you were like mostly windows seven and then, uh, and once you're used, like if you're used
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:13.480]  to it, it's, it really was fine. Like the biggest problem I had with windows and this
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:20.440]  surprises people was third party apps was actually the sort of like, you know, uh, the
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:25.800]  back apps and the functionality they provided and the, the general overall design and quality
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.560]  of them was weeks higher than the sort of third party windows app. Again, for like an
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:35.200]  individual, like when that surprised me with like, Oh, windows has a big app advantage,
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:39.520]  right? Well, that advantage is like line of business apps and like all of these like customized
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:43.320]  things for a particular business that are not there because of the great user interface.
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:50.000]  They're there because they do a very sort of specific function. And um, eh, eh, that,
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.400]  that was always the max sort of big advantage. The actual like day to day experience of using
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:57.160]  windows once you were used to it, windows seven was, it was honestly not that bad. It
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:03.440]  was, it was a lot better than I expected. But I agree that, but then when it was, they
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:07.760]  came along and it got a little, it got a lot more complicated.
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:13.240]  That's a good postscript to the show. Anyway, uh, people can read you on Twitter. Your regular
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:17.520]  Twitter account is at Ben Thompson and then, uh, anybody who actually is interested in
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:24.080]  your nightly musings and gloating lately on the Milwaukee bucks can find your sports stuff
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:30.720]  nicely separated in the no tech Ben, uh, Twitter account. I'm pretty sure no tech Ben hurts
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:36.880]  my business, but uh, no tech Ben hurts me because people come to me when I go off on
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:41.960]  sports on Twitter and they're like, can't you set up, can't you set up a note or a sports
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:49.080]  sports account like Thompson did? And I don't want to do that. But anyway, all right. Hey,
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:52.680]  have a great day. Sounds good. I'll talk to you later. I appreciate your time. Thank you
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:48:03.720]  Ben. Uh, yep. Bye bye.
