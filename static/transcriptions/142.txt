[00:00.480 --> 00:01.920]  You were at CES.
[00:01.920 --> 00:02.760]  I was.
[00:02.760 --> 00:04.380]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:04.380 --> 00:05.760]  So this is the second year, okay.
[00:05.760 --> 00:06.800]  And you came on the show last year
[00:06.800 --> 00:07.640]  and talked about CES, right?
[00:07.640 --> 00:10.280]  I think this might be our third or fourth
[00:10.280 --> 00:13.120]  annual CES discussion.
[00:13.120 --> 00:14.960]  And I think the first two I didn't go,
[00:14.960 --> 00:17.120]  and we were like, oh, we should go.
[00:17.120 --> 00:19.460]  And then last year I went for the first time.
[00:21.080 --> 00:25.160]  It is absolutely a John Groover, the talk show tradition
[00:25.160 --> 00:28.600]  that like mid January, I have someone on,
[00:28.600 --> 00:30.480]  we talk about CES, and then I say,
[00:30.480 --> 00:32.880]  you know what, damn it, next year I'm going.
[00:32.880 --> 00:36.680]  And then next year comes and goes, and I don't go.
[00:36.680 --> 00:38.600]  You almost need to start planning it now.
[00:38.600 --> 00:40.320]  And it's funny because they've already changed
[00:40.320 --> 00:43.720]  the website over to 2017 CES.
[00:43.720 --> 00:45.560]  I wonder if they have a script that does that.
[00:45.560 --> 00:48.040]  It was like the next day, boom.
[00:48.040 --> 00:49.840]  Their website's already turned over.
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.760]  It was great, man, I love it.
[00:52.760 --> 00:54.000]  It was super fun.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.740]  It's absolute insanity.
[00:55.740 --> 00:57.040]  I mean, you go to Vegas a lot.
[00:57.040 --> 01:01.840]  It is, and I had not been to Vegas in 10 years actually
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.080]  before last year's CES, and it is absolute chaos.
[01:06.080 --> 01:09.600]  I mean, there are 200,000 people there who do not belong.
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.520]  They are, they are from, it's kind of neat
[01:12.520 --> 01:14.700]  because basically what happens is at the beginning
[01:14.700 --> 01:19.700]  of the year, not everyone, but 200,000 people
[01:19.720 --> 01:23.840]  who work in tech and in adjacent industries
[01:23.840 --> 01:25.820]  are all living in one city for a week.
[01:25.820 --> 01:28.580]  So you run into people who, you know,
[01:28.580 --> 01:30.040]  you would not expect to see.
[01:30.040 --> 01:34.760]  I'm totally like randomly ran into a guy in a restaurant.
[01:34.760 --> 01:36.720]  We were both waiting to eat at the bar
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.400]  and we ended up eating lunch together.
[01:38.400 --> 01:40.720]  Who's like, was partially responsible
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.960]  for the creation of the MP3, random, random stuff like that.
[01:44.960 --> 01:47.840]  And then you're like reading Slack and your coworkers are
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.240]  like, Hey, you know that Reed Hastings is giving a talk
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.020]  across, you know, in another place in Vegas.
[01:53.020 --> 01:54.380]  I'm like, no, I didn't know that.
[01:54.380 --> 01:56.440]  You know, there's, there's just so much going on.
[01:56.440 --> 01:59.080]  It's, it's absolute madness and chaos,
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.000]  but if you can tolerate it, and I guess enough trips
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.520]  to Tokyo have now made me totally chilled out
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.400]  around massive crowds.
[02:09.400 --> 02:10.240]  It's really cool.
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.220]  It's very special.
[02:12.280 --> 02:15.880]  I think the crowds, they wouldn't, that wouldn't bother me.
[02:15.880 --> 02:17.320]  I can take crowds in small doses.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.160]  You know what I mean?
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.840]  Where I go to Disney a couple of times a year
[02:19.840 --> 02:20.880]  and stuff like that.
[02:20.880 --> 02:23.720]  What I like though with, if you go somewhere like that
[02:23.720 --> 02:27.680]  is if you can take the time to spend some time somewhere
[02:27.680 --> 02:30.000]  away from the crowd every day.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.600]  Yeah, where it gets to you, I don't mind the actual crowd
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.840]  where it gets to you is that the, the infrastructure
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.920]  is just way beyond capacity.
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.720]  I mean, people are talking about waiting an hour
[02:40.720 --> 02:44.440]  just to get on the monorail, just to get into the station
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.040]  or, you know, you go, you want to go anywhere to eat lunch,
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.040]  forget it, like you're waiting, or they have this shuttle
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.160]  bus that goes from one, cause it basically takes up
[02:55.160 --> 02:58.320]  both the sands and the Las Vegas convention centers.
[02:58.320 --> 03:00.280]  And they have a shuttle bus, a free shuttle bus
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.040]  that goes between them.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.880]  It can't be more than a mile.
[03:03.880 --> 03:04.720]  And you know what?
[03:04.720 --> 03:05.560]  It's not far.
[03:05.560 --> 03:07.840]  No, and I've walked it and it's totally walkable.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.240]  I mean, there's barely any sidewalk, but this bus trip
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.980]  takes like 40 minutes because there's so much traffic
[03:14.980 --> 03:16.800]  because everyone else is in a cab trying to get
[03:16.800 --> 03:17.800]  between these places.
[03:17.800 --> 03:20.880]  And it's just madness.
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.040]  Last year I stayed at the fairly far south end of the strip.
[03:25.040 --> 03:28.640]  And this year, one of my priorities was stay somewhere
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.960]  further closer to the action.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.720]  So at least you could walk from.
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.800]  South is the airport side, right?
[03:33.800 --> 03:35.200]  Like down by Mandalay Bay.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.040]  Yeah, Mandalay Bay.
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.680]  It's funny, in my head, I feel like that's up,
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.120]  like that's up the strip, down the strip is down by like
[03:42.120 --> 03:43.080]  the wind. Stratosphere.
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.800]  Yeah, but it's the other way around, right?
[03:44.800 --> 03:45.640]  Right, yeah.
[03:45.640 --> 03:47.560]  And so that was useful.
[03:47.560 --> 03:50.140]  Although a lot of the stuff, a lot of the like
[03:50.140 --> 03:53.480]  official press conferences are at Mandalay Bay.
[03:53.480 --> 03:55.800]  That's crazy though, it's like so far away.
[03:55.800 --> 03:59.400]  I know, I'm in a fortunate position where I could basically
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.400]  pick, you know, Quartz where I work, qz.com is, you know,
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.240]  we're still small enough that we can be picky
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.100]  about what we cover.
[04:09.100 --> 04:12.680]  So I don't have to actually go and live blog
[04:12.680 --> 04:15.640]  an Nvidia press conference or something like that.
[04:15.640 --> 04:17.200]  No one's telling me I need to do that.
[04:17.200 --> 04:20.440]  So I actually got to skip all those official press
[04:20.440 --> 04:21.420]  conference type things.
[04:21.420 --> 04:23.200]  So I didn't actually have to go down to Mandalay Bay
[04:23.200 --> 04:24.040]  this time.
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.360]  But a lot of the action, like the good stuff's going on
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.360]  at cosmopolitan, at the wind and Venetian.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.840]  So you really want to be hanging out toward,
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.560]  kind of centered in north strip most of the time.
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.080]  So was anybody else from Quartz there
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.640]  or were you the only representative of Quartz there?
[04:46.640 --> 04:49.300]  No, several, I think there were four of us this year,
[04:49.300 --> 04:50.840]  two from our ad side.
[04:50.840 --> 04:53.920]  And then my colleague, Mike Murphy, who's a reporter
[04:53.920 --> 04:58.920]  who writes about, we have a beat called machines with brains
[04:59.940 --> 05:03.020]  and it's drones, robots, AI, and that kind of stuff.
[05:03.020 --> 05:04.360]  And he was very busy.
[05:04.360 --> 05:09.360]  There was a lot, although he came to CES with a cold.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.020]  You can't do that.
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.240]  Cause you're going to get sick by the end,
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.720]  but you can't show up with a cold.
[05:15.720 --> 05:17.960]  So I felt bad about that.
[05:17.960 --> 05:21.980]  But so yeah, he was there with me and we were basically
[05:21.980 --> 05:24.760]  just doing meetings, hitting the show floor.
[05:24.760 --> 05:27.760]  The show floor is comically extensive.
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.380]  Like you can walk, I had my Apple watch with me.
[05:31.380 --> 05:33.840]  So Wednesday was my busiest day.
[05:33.840 --> 05:38.580]  I think I walked over 14 miles on Wednesday.
[05:38.580 --> 05:41.640]  Whereas on average day, I probably walked like six to eight.
[05:41.640 --> 05:42.640]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[05:42.640 --> 05:43.640]  Anything over 10 is a result.
[05:43.640 --> 05:48.440]  I did 27,000 steps, so that was pretty crazy.
[05:48.440 --> 05:53.440]  In boots too, which was dumb, but it was cool.
[05:53.760 --> 05:56.640]  So it's a recurring theme.
[05:56.640 --> 05:57.980]  And I know we say this every year,
[05:57.980 --> 06:00.580]  but that everybody goes to CES, quote unquote,
[06:00.580 --> 06:03.640]  everybody goes, but, and then all the writers,
[06:03.640 --> 06:05.300]  they all say they hate it.
[06:05.300 --> 06:07.720]  Everybody just, as soon as it hasn't even started yet
[06:07.720 --> 06:11.040]  and Twitter is filled with people in our racket
[06:11.040 --> 06:12.480]  saying how much they hate it.
[06:12.480 --> 06:16.880]  Which always makes me think, well, then why do you go?
[06:16.880 --> 06:19.120]  You know, like, why does everybody go to this thing
[06:19.120 --> 06:19.960]  that they hate?
[06:19.960 --> 06:20.880]  But I'm exactly with you.
[06:20.880 --> 06:25.880]  My temptation to go is it's because I obviously,
[06:26.120 --> 06:27.560]  I could write whatever the hell I want.
[06:27.560 --> 06:30.200]  So I'm not going, and I can skip whatever I want.
[06:30.200 --> 06:32.760]  So, well, I understand that the hatred comes from people
[06:32.760 --> 06:35.340]  who, if you get an assignment from an editor
[06:35.340 --> 06:36.780]  and they're like, here, here's your list
[06:36.780 --> 06:39.560]  of press conferences to go to figure out what's new
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.840]  from LG and Samsung and whoever.
[06:43.840 --> 06:45.360]  And it all just starts to blur together
[06:45.360 --> 06:47.320]  because everybody is making the exact same things.
[06:47.320 --> 06:52.320]  Five inch Android phones and tablets and curved OLED TVs
[06:52.640 --> 06:54.340]  and it all just blurs together.
[06:54.340 --> 06:56.820]  And then you've got a schlep from one end to the other
[06:56.820 --> 06:58.400]  and it's gotta be backbreaking.
[06:58.400 --> 07:01.160]  If you can't pick and choose where you go.
[07:01.160 --> 07:04.340]  One of the things we struggled with was we shot a video.
[07:04.340 --> 07:08.280]  Mike put on this exoskeleton suit that's designed
[07:08.280 --> 07:10.560]  to age you to like a hundred years old
[07:10.560 --> 07:12.880]  or something like that and do various things.
[07:12.880 --> 07:14.840]  It had like VR goggles built in
[07:14.840 --> 07:17.760]  and things that would make your muscles,
[07:17.760 --> 07:20.920]  that basically make your body move more slowly
[07:20.920 --> 07:23.160]  and it would affect your vision and all this stuff.
[07:23.160 --> 07:26.080]  And we took this video of him in this suit
[07:26.080 --> 07:30.000]  and then we realized that we literally didn't have
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.600]  the ability to upload the video to Dropbox.
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.600]  Like we, I'm not gonna tether on my cell phone and do it.
[07:36.600 --> 07:38.160]  Our hotel wifi sucked.
[07:38.160 --> 07:39.000]  We couldn't do it.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.160]  It's like, okay, we almost have to go to a Starbucks.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.800]  And I wonder if the press room
[07:42.800 --> 07:45.160]  had a free ethernet connection.
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.640]  We didn't actually go in the press room
[07:46.640 --> 07:49.760]  because it seemed like it was kind of a dump
[07:49.760 --> 07:53.180]  but actually that may have solved our problem.
[07:53.180 --> 07:54.520]  But it's just stuff like that
[07:54.520 --> 07:57.420]  where you're just completely out of your element.
[07:57.420 --> 07:58.260]  But it's amazing.
[07:58.260 --> 08:00.560]  Like you go, one of the things we did
[08:00.560 --> 08:02.480]  is we scraped the list of exhibitors
[08:02.480 --> 08:04.720]  and just did some very basic text analysis
[08:04.720 --> 08:08.760]  to see if there's anything interesting we could find.
[08:08.760 --> 08:11.760]  One thing that was cool was over 500 of the companies
[08:11.760 --> 08:15.240]  had the word Shenzhen in the title of the company.
[08:15.240 --> 08:20.200]  There are aisles and aisles and aisles of tiny booths
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.180]  with one or two people from Shenzhen, from China
[08:23.180 --> 08:25.000]  who come to America once a year.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.520]  And there they are.
[08:26.520 --> 08:30.640]  And I got a great little tour from a little old lady
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.220]  of her line of perfect GoPro knockoffs.
[08:34.220 --> 08:37.680]  And she's like giving me a demo of these things.
[08:37.680 --> 08:39.760]  The same case, same size,
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.440]  looks exactly like a GoPro
[08:41.440 --> 08:43.960]  but it's $60 or something like that.
[08:43.960 --> 08:47.240]  Was she saying it looks like a GoPro?
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.840]  Or was that, so she was mentioning the word GoPro.
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.760]  Yeah, yeah, totally.
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.160]  Like that's the same case as a GoPro.
[08:54.160 --> 08:56.920]  Actually one of the booths, you probably saw this.
[08:56.920 --> 09:00.600]  One of the booths, one of the hoverboard knockoffs
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.600]  was so similar to this one specific kind of balance board
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.200]  thing that the U.S. Marshals rated it.
[09:08.200 --> 09:09.200]  No, I didn't see this.
[09:09.200 --> 09:10.540]  Oh yeah.
[09:10.540 --> 09:12.200]  I think Bloomberg got tipped off
[09:12.200 --> 09:14.440]  because I think some other sites got tipped off too
[09:14.440 --> 09:15.640]  and they videotaped it.
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.040]  And basically the U.S. Marshals rated a booth.
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.480]  They confiscated all the product and shut these guys down.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.440]  Yeah, yeah, it was crazy.
[09:26.440 --> 09:29.600]  I mean, there are a lot of knockoff looking things
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.600]  and I believe the Bloomberg article interviewed someone
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.160]  from the people who put together the show
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.200]  and they're kind of, as long as you're not,
[09:41.200 --> 09:44.060]  I forgot what the kind of limitations are
[09:44.060 --> 09:48.100]  but basically like don't be too fake, I think is the line.
[09:49.060 --> 09:52.160]  So in this case, that didn't work out.
[09:52.160 --> 09:54.600]  That's gotta be such a surprise to the vendor.
[09:54.600 --> 09:59.320]  It's like, you know what I mean, it's like there's,
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.880]  the culture of how we value knockoffs
[10:03.880 --> 10:06.200]  is so different between here and China.
[10:06.200 --> 10:09.160]  And it's obviously, the whole concept
[10:09.160 --> 10:10.600]  of intellectual property isn't really
[10:10.600 --> 10:13.980]  like an institutional cultural thing over there.
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.280]  Like there's no way that they would have,
[10:17.280 --> 10:19.120]  that had to be a complete surprise
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.980]  because if they would have thought it's even a possibility,
[10:20.980 --> 10:23.160]  they would have dialed it back.
[10:23.160 --> 10:26.160]  I think so, it seemed like they were surprised.
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.440]  I wasn't there and I actually tried to look for the booth
[10:28.440 --> 10:29.920]  but I couldn't really find it
[10:29.920 --> 10:32.880]  and it wasn't really worth putting a lot of effort into
[10:32.880 --> 10:35.720]  but that's the kind of stuff that goes on.
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.040]  But meanwhile, there's like 40 different drone companies
[10:39.040 --> 10:42.200]  and of all shapes and sizes,
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.640]  a bunch of companies who paid up big bucks for big booths
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.800]  like the size of an Intel booth from China
[10:49.800 --> 10:51.800]  that you really haven't heard of
[10:51.800 --> 10:53.800]  unless you're in the TV industry.
[10:53.800 --> 10:56.680]  So it was really fascinating.
[10:56.680 --> 11:00.240]  You realize how insignificant you are in the world
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.280]  when you're at CES,
[11:01.280 --> 11:04.360]  like there's just so much stuff you've never heard of
[11:04.360 --> 11:07.520]  and there's so many people who are doing stuff
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.780]  that is similar to what you're doing
[11:09.780 --> 11:11.200]  but you've never heard of before
[11:11.200 --> 11:16.200]  and you walk around exhausted, dehydrated
[11:16.300 --> 11:19.560]  and it's cool, I love it, it's great.
[11:19.560 --> 11:22.280]  Why are you dehydrated?
[11:22.280 --> 11:24.740]  Can't you get water?
[11:24.740 --> 11:25.920]  I guess.
[11:25.920 --> 11:28.680]  Yeah, I actually, I joke about this
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.080]  but like I almost set calendar reminders saying,
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.720]  okay, drink water right now, make sure you have lunch
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.920]  because then it's three o'clock
[11:34.920 --> 11:37.560]  and you haven't eaten lunch and you're falling asleep.
[11:37.560 --> 11:40.300]  I was carrying around a kind bar in my backpack
[11:40.300 --> 11:43.620]  just to make sure that if I needed some protein,
[11:43.620 --> 11:44.880]  I'd still be alive.
[11:44.880 --> 11:45.720]  I find that true.
[11:45.720 --> 11:50.000]  I do, I've developed the reflexive habit of always
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.740]  be drinking something in Vegas.
[11:51.740 --> 11:54.740]  So in the morning, you're guzzling coffee
[11:54.740 --> 11:57.360]  or afternoon whenever you wake up
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.080]  but then in the afternoon, it's like at any free moment,
[12:00.080 --> 12:02.360]  if you have an opportunity to put a water in your hand,
[12:02.360 --> 12:04.800]  do it and because it's like really,
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.100]  it's like in addition to the dehydrating effects of alcohol,
[12:10.500 --> 12:13.680]  the desert air really is a thing if you're not used to it.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.400]  I mean, and it really, even if you weren't,
[12:15.400 --> 12:16.600]  even if you don't drink alcohol,
[12:16.600 --> 12:19.760]  I mean, you're gonna get dried out in Vegas.
[12:19.760 --> 12:22.760]  Shockingly, it was actually raining a couple of the days,
[12:22.760 --> 12:25.640]  which was super weird.
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.520]  Yeah, I remember I saw people completely,
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.560]  and it definitely makes everything worse
[12:29.560 --> 12:32.200]  because any temptation to walk is decreased.
[12:32.200 --> 12:34.380]  People actually dry, I've been out there when it rained
[12:34.380 --> 12:37.960]  and it's like people, the natives, the locals,
[12:37.960 --> 12:39.160]  they don't know how to drive in the rain.
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.860]  It's like just, it's not icy, obviously.
[12:42.860 --> 12:45.800]  It's usually even in the winter, above freezing.
[12:47.420 --> 12:48.840]  But the roads get a little wet
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.560]  and people are slipping and sliding.
[12:50.560 --> 12:52.760]  They don't even know how to drive on wet roads.
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.400]  Yeah, that was weird, but it didn't get too bad.
[12:58.400 --> 13:01.120]  So I brought an umbrella and I didn't have to use it.
[13:01.120 --> 13:02.320]  So it was fine.
[13:02.320 --> 13:03.760]  It was interesting though,
[13:03.760 --> 13:06.640]  and I definitely feel like going back,
[13:06.640 --> 13:08.040]  I'm definitely gonna go back next year
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.840]  from in the position too.
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.860]  I think that, and my advice to you would be,
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.800]  do think a little bit ahead of time
[13:17.800 --> 13:19.880]  and plan way ahead.
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.160]  I booked my hotel in, I wanna say November,
[13:23.160 --> 13:26.040]  and by then every good place was sold out.
[13:26.040 --> 13:28.620]  You really have to do it in August or September,
[13:28.620 --> 13:31.760]  whenever they open up reservations, just book it.
[13:31.760 --> 13:33.960]  And think a little bit ahead of time
[13:33.960 --> 13:36.360]  about what you wanna get out of it,
[13:36.360 --> 13:39.080]  but really save a lot of time to wing it
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.880]  because there's just gonna be stuff that
[13:41.880 --> 13:44.860]  either you don't know about until you get there or.
[13:44.860 --> 13:48.780]  I'm always confused by just the basic schedule of CES.
[13:48.780 --> 13:49.620]  Tell me if I'm wrong.
[13:49.620 --> 13:53.320]  I think the convention itself, the show floor,
[13:53.320 --> 13:55.060]  is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.400]  Yeah, and it changes.
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.000]  It was different this year though, actually.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.520]  Maybe that's why I'm confused then.
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.240]  Yeah, I think this year it was Wednesday,
[14:06.240 --> 14:08.220]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[14:08.220 --> 14:10.180]  but I think previous years it was Tuesday,
[14:10.180 --> 14:12.520]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.760]  I don't know, it was definitely a day off this year
[14:14.760 --> 14:17.440]  to go later, I think because of the holiday.
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.000]  But everybody who covers it,
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.240]  or almost everybody who covers it,
[14:20.240 --> 14:21.280]  comes a couple days early
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.240]  because there's pre-show announcements.
[14:25.880 --> 14:27.160]  I don't know if they call them keynotes,
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.160]  but there's big keynote addresses that happen this week,
[14:32.160 --> 14:34.640]  like this year on Monday and Tuesday.
[14:34.640 --> 14:37.360]  There are press conferences and then there are keynotes,
[14:37.360 --> 14:39.520]  and they're separate, I guess.
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.200]  I don't know, I remember Steve Ballmer always did
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.280]  what was like the Sunday night warmup.
[14:45.280 --> 14:46.440]  Yeah, the kickoff.
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.760]  I don't know, this year there were some things,
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.920]  we were gonna go on Sunday,
[14:50.920 --> 14:53.040]  and then I think there may have even been some stuff
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.000]  Saturday, or at least Sunday,
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.160]  and we decided to fly in on Monday and then leave Friday.
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.160]  We did miss some stuff that had happened Monday,
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.760]  but Tuesday, the show floor was not open yet,
[15:06.760 --> 15:09.960]  although we got in to do a couple meetings.
[15:09.960 --> 15:12.960]  They escorted us in, and it was crazy.
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.760]  A lot of the booths were barely half-finished
[15:15.760 --> 15:17.440]  like the day before,
[15:17.440 --> 15:19.640]  and people were definitely there all night
[15:19.640 --> 15:20.780]  working to set stuff up.
[15:20.780 --> 15:24.340]  And it's absolutely like you could get killed
[15:24.340 --> 15:26.040]  by a machine any second.
[15:26.040 --> 15:28.480]  There were just lots of stuff going on.
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.200]  And then Wednesday is when it was totally open
[15:33.200 --> 15:35.280]  and just chaos.
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.120]  I had a guided tour of the Samsung booth,
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.700]  but it was really not useful for any of us
[15:41.700 --> 15:44.120]  because there were just so many people
[15:44.120 --> 15:46.320]  standing between you and the refrigerator
[15:46.320 --> 15:48.660]  with the TV on it that you could barely even see it.
[15:48.660 --> 15:50.860]  It was just absolute chaos.
[15:52.360 --> 15:53.840]  And most of that stuff was at
[15:53.840 --> 15:55.560]  the Las Vegas Convention Center,
[15:55.560 --> 15:57.960]  or was it split, like the show floor is literally split
[15:57.960 --> 16:00.680]  between the convention center and the Sands?
[16:00.680 --> 16:01.520]  Split.
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.120]  And I bet there's some sort of theme to it.
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.360]  So the basement of the Sands
[16:08.360 --> 16:11.240]  has a lot of very small booths.
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.560]  And that's actually one of the best things I did
[16:14.560 --> 16:18.120]  was I met up with a couple guys from Kickstarter,
[16:18.120 --> 16:21.880]  and they took me on a tour of the little,
[16:21.880 --> 16:23.860]  like the interesting startups
[16:23.860 --> 16:26.480]  that had all either done Kickstarters
[16:26.480 --> 16:28.480]  or were going to be doing Kickstarters.
[16:29.440 --> 16:30.700]  And that was actually really cool
[16:30.700 --> 16:32.800]  because there was a bunch of stuff I had never heard of,
[16:32.800 --> 16:34.940]  and it was all pretty good.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.880]  There's just a lot of garbage everywhere.
[16:36.880 --> 16:38.920]  So you have to try to find the good stuff.
[16:38.920 --> 16:41.640]  That's the thing that I miss about Macworld.
[16:41.640 --> 16:43.640]  And Macworld was, you know, and it's,
[16:43.640 --> 16:45.400]  I've said that, you know,
[16:45.400 --> 16:46.720]  I'll say it again next year too,
[16:46.720 --> 16:49.000]  but the whole reason I never got into the habit
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.480]  of going to CES was that it overlapped with Macworld,
[16:52.480 --> 16:53.640]  and I went to Macworld.
[16:54.700 --> 16:56.140]  And then even when Macworld,
[16:56.140 --> 17:01.140]  like after like Macworld's multi-year slow demise
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.760]  from being a thing to being literally nothing,
[17:05.760 --> 17:08.120]  started with them moving the date around
[17:08.120 --> 17:10.400]  where they moved it to the end of January.
[17:10.400 --> 17:11.320]  And then there was the one year
[17:11.320 --> 17:14.560]  where they had a Super Bowl weekend, which was stupid.
[17:14.560 --> 17:16.840]  I forget, it went into February,
[17:16.840 --> 17:19.120]  I think before they finally pulled the plug.
[17:19.120 --> 17:21.200]  But even then when it wouldn't overlap,
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.800]  it just felt, that felt like too much.
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.800]  Like it felt like I don't want to go to two of these things
[17:24.800 --> 17:25.620]  if I don't have to.
[17:25.620 --> 17:27.040]  So I'll just keep going to Macworld.
[17:27.040 --> 17:29.220]  But that's one of the reasons I didn't get in the habit of it
[17:29.220 --> 17:31.820]  but one of my favorite things about going to Macworld
[17:31.820 --> 17:34.880]  without question was talking to the little booths.
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.480]  The little booths were always way more interesting
[17:37.480 --> 17:38.320]  than the big ones,
[17:38.320 --> 17:41.320]  because usually you get to talk to the actual principals.
[17:41.320 --> 17:44.040]  And there would always be, you know,
[17:44.040 --> 17:45.960]  at least a couple of booths that were like,
[17:45.960 --> 17:48.520]  wow, I did not even know that that was possible
[17:48.520 --> 17:50.640]  type products.
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.800]  Yeah, one of them I saw that was pretty cool
[17:52.800 --> 17:56.320]  was a very small booth of a company
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.680]  that makes this clip on camera
[17:58.680 --> 18:00.400]  that just kind of goes on your lapel.
[18:00.400 --> 18:02.840]  And it's not recording video all day.
[18:02.840 --> 18:06.540]  It's constantly doing image analysis and recognition
[18:06.540 --> 18:09.680]  and making a text list via API
[18:09.680 --> 18:11.760]  of all the stuff that you've seen that day.
[18:11.760 --> 18:12.600]  So.
[18:12.600 --> 18:13.920]  Wow, that's crazy.
[18:13.920 --> 18:15.080]  Yeah, it was very cool.
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.160]  I actually have to write it up.
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.600]  I took some photos of it
[18:17.600 --> 18:20.120]  and I'll write up a post about it.
[18:20.120 --> 18:22.900]  But, you know, and it's, this is the kind of thing
[18:22.900 --> 18:24.940]  where it's like, this is really cool technology.
[18:24.940 --> 18:27.020]  This could be a cool product in a couple of years
[18:27.020 --> 18:29.040]  or in a year, or it could be nothing,
[18:29.040 --> 18:31.000]  but here these guys are, you know,
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.840]  they got kind of a, you know, an okay looking booth
[18:35.840 --> 18:39.680]  and this really interesting technology that, you know,
[18:39.680 --> 18:40.680]  and it's actually kind of cool.
[18:40.680 --> 18:42.920]  Like, you know, and of course,
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.480]  with any camera that's always on privacy concerns,
[18:46.480 --> 18:49.380]  but you could maybe train it to your LinkedIn account.
[18:49.380 --> 18:51.200]  So it could tell you who you're looking at
[18:51.200 --> 18:52.920]  at a party or something like that.
[18:54.660 --> 18:56.280]  I don't know, it was interesting.
[18:56.280 --> 18:58.620]  And it was one of those things where it was like,
[18:58.620 --> 19:00.260]  all right, this is kind of the value
[19:00.260 --> 19:01.560]  of coming to a show like this
[19:01.560 --> 19:03.880]  because I never probably would have met
[19:03.880 --> 19:05.040]  these people otherwise.
[19:05.040 --> 19:07.620]  And it's not like you're standing
[19:07.620 --> 19:10.160]  in the gigantic Intel booth, not one, you know,
[19:10.160 --> 19:12.600]  wondering what you're doing there.
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.400]  So that was pretty cool.
[19:14.400 --> 19:17.620]  I saw there was an episode of,
[19:17.620 --> 19:19.960]  I mean, it's not a new idea,
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.560]  but the BBC show Sherlock, I think it was Sherlock,
[19:24.560 --> 19:28.140]  but there was like a billionaire magnate,
[19:29.280 --> 19:30.760]  bad guy sort of person.
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.520]  And he had like, he had just had regular wire rim glasses,
[19:34.520 --> 19:37.220]  but when they showed his first person perspective,
[19:37.220 --> 19:40.040]  it would instantly give him a sort of profile
[19:40.040 --> 19:41.560]  of anybody whose face he was looking at,
[19:41.560 --> 19:44.880]  you know, their name and, you know, some facts about them.
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.560]  And I feel like that is like, it's still science fiction,
[19:49.560 --> 19:52.240]  but it's very, very near term science fiction.
[19:52.240 --> 19:55.320]  Like it's going to happen, you know, within the next decade.
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.520]  Yeah, I mean, I kind of, I'm always the guy who wants,
[20:01.520 --> 20:04.620]  I want the feed of random Instagram photos
[20:04.620 --> 20:06.400]  that I'm in the background of.
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.240]  No, I do too.
[20:08.120 --> 20:12.200]  I'm, you know, I feel like we as a society and culture
[20:12.200 --> 20:15.000]  just, we're already wrapping our heads around the fact
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.600]  that everything is on camera all the time.
[20:17.600 --> 20:18.440]  Totally.
[20:18.440 --> 20:20.560]  You know, and it's, you know, it's like,
[20:20.560 --> 20:23.320]  and some of the people who are adjusting the slowest
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.080]  are the ones who really should be adjusting the quickest,
[20:28.080 --> 20:30.040]  you know, like the way that when police officers
[20:30.040 --> 20:32.120]  have some kind of incident and it's all caught on tape
[20:32.120 --> 20:36.220]  and you see that it's just absolutely horrible police work.
[20:37.260 --> 20:38.480]  That's actually, you know, to me,
[20:38.480 --> 20:41.720]  it's helping to make our society better.
[20:41.720 --> 20:43.880]  I mean, there's obviously trade-offs, big, big trade-offs,
[20:43.880 --> 20:46.120]  and there's some definite downsides to the lack of privacy,
[20:46.120 --> 20:46.960]  but...
[20:48.500 --> 20:51.640]  I think that specifically has proven to be very powerful
[20:51.640 --> 20:53.840]  over the last couple of years.
[20:53.840 --> 20:56.760]  You know, what was weird though was looking up
[20:56.760 --> 20:58.880]  and seeing a guy wearing Google Glass
[20:58.880 --> 21:01.160]  for the first time in over a year.
[21:01.160 --> 21:02.840]  That was crazy.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.960]  That was very weird.
[21:05.120 --> 21:07.240]  How many people did you see at CES wearing Google Glass?
[21:07.240 --> 21:08.760]  Because I feel like if there's anywhere left
[21:08.760 --> 21:11.160]  that people are still pretending that Google Glass
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.720]  is gonna be a thing, it's CES.
[21:13.720 --> 21:16.960]  I saw two in a row, and that was it.
[21:16.960 --> 21:21.000]  Like two in the basement of the Palms, or Palms,
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.280]  the basement of the Sands Convention Center.
[21:24.280 --> 21:27.420]  And that was at the whole show, two guys.
[21:27.420 --> 21:29.760]  And the one guy was like tall and large,
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.760]  and it was just kind of weird.
[21:32.760 --> 21:33.920]  But that was the last time I'd seen him.
[21:33.920 --> 21:36.120]  Sometimes in New York, you see them when you're walking
[21:36.120 --> 21:39.080]  around over by the Google offices,
[21:39.080 --> 21:44.080]  but otherwise I haven't seen one in at least over a year.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.080]  All right, let's hold this thought.
[21:45.080 --> 21:46.620]  I still have more CES stuff to talk about,
[21:46.620 --> 21:49.040]  but I might as well fit in our first break here
[21:49.040 --> 21:54.040]  and tell you about our good friends at Wealthfront.
[21:54.040 --> 21:57.440]  Wealthfront is a low cost, automated investment service
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.280]  that makes it easy to invest your money the right way.
[22:00.280 --> 22:02.760]  It works 24 seven to manage your portfolio,
[22:02.760 --> 22:05.280]  keeping it diversified, customized
[22:05.280 --> 22:08.400]  to your personal risk profile,
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.280]  and it optimizes its trading behavior
[22:10.280 --> 22:15.280]  to keep your tax bill low, all without charging commissions.
[22:15.640 --> 22:17.560]  Whether you've got millions of dollars to invest,
[22:17.560 --> 22:20.480]  or you're just starting out and you want to start
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.520]  a regular program to save for your retirement,
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.320]  Wealthfront is a great fit for you.
[22:27.320 --> 22:28.440]  So where do you go to find out more?
[22:28.440 --> 22:29.280]  Go to their website.
[22:29.280 --> 22:32.600]  It's wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[22:33.820 --> 22:35.920]  Just a couple of the points here.
[22:35.920 --> 22:38.800]  More or less Wealthfront is an automated service
[22:38.800 --> 22:41.060]  that replaces like a personal financial manager.
[22:41.060 --> 22:42.640]  And the reason you might want to consider that
[22:42.640 --> 22:45.840]  is that algorithms can actually do pretty good with this
[22:45.840 --> 22:47.760]  just by putting your money into index funds.
[22:47.760 --> 22:48.880]  It's not really Wealthfront.
[22:48.880 --> 22:50.600]  You can read all the details on their website,
[22:50.600 --> 22:52.600]  but they're not really about like trying to magically pick
[22:52.600 --> 22:55.160]  individual companies that their stock is going to go up.
[22:55.160 --> 22:56.800]  That's really, really tough.
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.360]  And most people who try that don't win.
[22:58.360 --> 23:01.020]  The way to win in the longterm is to go with index funds.
[23:01.020 --> 23:03.480]  And that's what Wealthfront mostly does.
[23:03.480 --> 23:06.440]  But they charge way, way less than a personal
[23:06.440 --> 23:07.680]  financial manager.
[23:07.680 --> 23:12.120]  Instead of one to 3% of the money under management,
[23:12.120 --> 23:14.360]  they charge a fraction of 1%
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.980]  and they don't charge anything up to $10,000.
[23:18.820 --> 23:21.480]  And for listeners of the show who go to wealthfront.com
[23:21.480 --> 23:24.400]  slash the talk show, they actually raise that up to 15,000.
[23:24.400 --> 23:26.320]  So the first $15,000 you put in there,
[23:26.320 --> 23:29.480]  just to see how it works and see if it works for you
[23:29.480 --> 23:31.880]  and your family, you don't pay any fees at all.
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.520]  So you really can't beat that.
[23:33.520 --> 23:35.640]  Last but not least for compliance purposes,
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.300]  I have to read this to you.
[23:38.300 --> 23:41.040]  Wealthfront is an SEC registered investment advisor.
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.360]  Brokerage services are offered through Wealthfront
[23:43.360 --> 23:47.960]  Brokerage Corporation member, F-I-N-R-A and S-I-P-C.
[23:47.960 --> 23:51.220]  This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
[23:51.220 --> 23:52.880]  Investing in securities involves risks
[23:52.880 --> 23:55.400]  and there is the possibility of losing money.
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.520]  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
[23:57.520 --> 24:02.520]  Please visit wealthfront.com to read their full disclosure.
[24:06.620 --> 24:08.800]  So you didn't get there till Monday, you're saying?
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.020]  That's right, Monday night.
[24:10.020 --> 24:11.660]  So what did you do on Tuesday?
[24:11.660 --> 24:16.660]  Tuesday, I woke up too early and got breakfast
[24:19.040 --> 24:21.040]  and then we went to this meeting
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.960]  where Mike wore the exoskeleton and it was-
[24:24.960 --> 24:26.560]  How did you set that meeting up?
[24:26.560 --> 24:28.880]  That's one of my worries is that I would go there
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.360]  and without having set anything up
[24:30.360 --> 24:33.120]  and I don't have anybody who set stuff up for me
[24:33.120 --> 24:33.960]  and then I'd get out there
[24:33.960 --> 24:37.020]  and I'd just end up playing blackjack all day.
[24:37.020 --> 24:37.920]  See, that would be fun.
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.960]  I would like to play blackjack with you all day
[24:39.960 --> 24:41.360]  because as we'll discuss in a minute,
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.360]  I did not play any blackjack, so which is not excusable.
[24:46.400 --> 24:49.120]  I don't see how that, again, I don't see how that's-
[24:49.120 --> 24:49.960]  I know, I know.
[24:49.960 --> 24:52.940]  So here's the worst part of CES.
[24:52.940 --> 24:56.580]  When you sign up for a press badge,
[24:56.580 --> 25:01.180]  your email gets given to all the 3000 or whatever,
[25:01.180 --> 25:05.260]  2000 companies that have signed up to exhibit
[25:06.180 --> 25:08.780]  and you get emails from about half of them.
[25:08.780 --> 25:10.260]  I'm not even exaggerating.
[25:10.260 --> 25:13.580]  Like this year I was smart and I did the Gmail thing
[25:13.580 --> 25:16.220]  where you can add a plus sign and then,
[25:16.220 --> 25:20.540]  so I made it, you know, danpluscesatqz.com
[25:20.540 --> 25:23.780]  so I could filter, they're now all filtering into the toilet
[25:23.780 --> 25:25.100]  like I'm not getting,
[25:25.100 --> 25:26.540]  the people are still sending emails.
[25:26.540 --> 25:29.980]  They're good for them, but I'm not seeing any of them.
[25:29.980 --> 25:32.540]  So you get, you're overwhelmed for weeks.
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.460]  I know about that trick.
[25:33.460 --> 25:35.260]  I just want to just, I mean, hold you there,
[25:35.260 --> 25:38.180]  is that it instantly popped into my head.
[25:38.180 --> 25:40.820]  I mean, it's like if I was the type of dirtbag
[25:40.820 --> 25:43.700]  who ran like a PR, well, PR people aren't dirtbags,
[25:43.700 --> 25:45.840]  but if I was about to start sending email to those people,
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.620]  I would write like a little script
[25:47.620 --> 25:49.700]  that takes any Gmail address with the plus
[25:49.700 --> 25:52.300]  and take out the plus, you know what I mean?
[25:52.300 --> 25:55.540]  Like it would be so easy to algorithmically filter that out.
[25:55.540 --> 25:57.700]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure some,
[25:57.700 --> 25:59.300]  a couple of people remarked on it.
[25:59.300 --> 26:02.900]  They were like, oh, clever with the plus sign or whatever.
[26:02.900 --> 26:05.840]  I mean, I get a lot of email from PR people as it is
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.400]  and I'm actually, I would say pretty fair
[26:09.400 --> 26:11.500]  about just asking people not to send me
[26:11.500 --> 26:12.580]  certain types of email.
[26:12.580 --> 26:15.660]  I find it so hard like at a convention or conference
[26:15.660 --> 26:16.500]  or something like that.
[26:16.500 --> 26:18.400]  I'm terrible at staying on top of my email
[26:18.400 --> 26:19.900]  on a normal day when I'm at my desk,
[26:19.900 --> 26:21.560]  but it's really, I always fall behind.
[26:21.560 --> 26:24.500]  And so to have them making it even harder
[26:24.500 --> 26:28.060]  to just keep an eyeball on what's coming into my email
[26:28.060 --> 26:29.600]  would be terrible.
[26:30.500 --> 26:33.460]  The problem for me is that I've now been at inbox zero
[26:33.460 --> 26:36.420]  for four years, which means all day
[26:36.420 --> 26:38.640]  I'm constantly deleting emails.
[26:39.580 --> 26:41.340]  I don't let them pile up anymore.
[26:41.340 --> 26:46.340]  So anyway, so I would get invited to everything
[26:46.340 --> 26:50.000]  from like tours to meetings, to press conferences
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.060]  and that kind of stuff.
[26:51.060 --> 26:55.260]  And I accepted, I think five or six of the,
[26:55.260 --> 26:58.220]  I don't know, roughly a thousand that I got.
[26:58.220 --> 27:00.540]  And I say-
[27:00.540 --> 27:02.480]  And those came, but just to be clear,
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.500]  those came long before the show even started
[27:06.500 --> 27:09.900]  because it starts when you actually register with CES
[27:09.900 --> 27:11.960]  like in November or whatever.
[27:11.960 --> 27:13.020]  Yes. Okay.
[27:13.020 --> 27:17.100]  Yeah, so, and some of them are like party invites
[27:17.100 --> 27:22.100]  and some of the stuff doesn't come until the week before
[27:22.380 --> 27:24.140]  or a couple of days before,
[27:24.140 --> 27:27.560]  but a lot of the companies are trying to set up
[27:27.560 --> 27:29.420]  as many meetings as possible.
[27:29.420 --> 27:32.700]  You can also kind of check what topics you're interested in.
[27:32.700 --> 27:34.740]  And I think I was probably a little too excited
[27:34.740 --> 27:37.680]  about checking lots of different topics
[27:37.680 --> 27:40.820]  that I should not have like audio,
[27:40.820 --> 27:43.180]  you check off audio and then every headphone company
[27:43.180 --> 27:45.700]  is emailing you asking for a meeting and that kind of stuff.
[27:45.700 --> 27:47.800]  So I think next year,
[27:47.800 --> 27:50.640]  I'll probably be more selective about that
[27:50.640 --> 27:52.060]  and do even fewer meetings.
[27:52.060 --> 27:56.260]  Cause if you need to get a last minute meeting,
[27:56.260 --> 27:58.580]  they're pretty much always available.
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.620]  The stuff that's really cool
[28:00.620 --> 28:02.700]  is gonna be kind of hard to access anyway.
[28:02.700 --> 28:04.460]  And those are the people who are at least likely
[28:04.460 --> 28:07.440]  to set stuff up with you ahead of time,
[28:07.440 --> 28:10.860]  unless you're whatever the verge or something like that,
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.600]  who get first dibs on a lot of stuff.
[28:16.540 --> 28:18.120]  So yeah, I set all that stuff up.
[28:18.120 --> 28:20.500]  And so what else I, Tuesday,
[28:20.500 --> 28:24.240]  I had a couple of meetings and I had lunch
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.900]  and then I went to a dinner probably
[28:28.900 --> 28:30.460]  and then met up with people.
[28:30.460 --> 28:34.900]  Oh, Tuesday I went to a party and stayed out late.
[28:34.900 --> 28:38.820]  And yeah, and that's when I saw Rupert Murdoch.
[28:38.820 --> 28:40.360]  That was kind of interesting.
[28:41.720 --> 28:42.860]  So where was he?
[28:42.860 --> 28:45.700]  He was just walking down the hall of the Wynn.
[28:45.700 --> 28:47.700]  That's where he stayed.
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.140]  So I actually wrote this article.
[28:49.140 --> 28:51.980]  So one thing I didn't know,
[28:51.980 --> 28:55.340]  and I thought it was gonna be a bigger surprise
[28:55.340 --> 28:56.660]  to people than it turned out to be.
[28:56.660 --> 29:01.660]  No one really cared, but so Eddie Q was at CES.
[29:01.980 --> 29:02.820]  Eddie Q.
[29:02.820 --> 29:03.820]  You wrote an article on this?
[29:03.820 --> 29:04.760]  Yes.
[29:04.760 --> 29:05.600]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.580]  Eddie Q was at CES speaking
[29:07.580 --> 29:11.340]  at Rupert Murdoch's private mini conference,
[29:11.340 --> 29:13.700]  which he holds in his suite every year.
[29:13.700 --> 29:16.100]  It's two days and he brings in
[29:16.100 --> 29:18.900]  like a fantastic list of people.
[29:18.900 --> 29:20.860]  And it's not for the public or anything.
[29:20.860 --> 29:24.420]  It's for News Corp and Fox executives.
[29:24.420 --> 29:28.260]  And this year, the people who were scheduled to present
[29:28.260 --> 29:33.160]  range from the CEO of Snapchat to Sundar from Google,
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.040]  CEO of Google, Eddie Q from Apple,
[29:37.040 --> 29:39.540]  and a bunch, just a bunch of other,
[29:39.540 --> 29:41.460]  like the guy from Salesforce.com,
[29:41.460 --> 29:44.740]  a bunch of other really high level Benedict Evans
[29:44.740 --> 29:47.780]  from Andreessen Horowitz, some startup people.
[29:47.780 --> 29:50.020]  And so that's cool.
[29:50.020 --> 29:52.220]  And that's the kind of thing where it's like,
[29:52.220 --> 29:54.380]  there's this whole huge CES thing going on.
[29:54.380 --> 29:56.900]  Meanwhile, in Rupert Murdoch's suite,
[29:56.900 --> 29:58.920]  there's like the best,
[29:58.920 --> 30:01.540]  one of the best conference lineups in the world.
[30:01.540 --> 30:05.460]  And it's just for like a handful of top executives
[30:05.460 --> 30:06.580]  who work for him.
[30:06.580 --> 30:08.300]  But that's the kind of thing you can do at CES
[30:08.300 --> 30:10.980]  because so many of those people are there anyway.
[30:10.980 --> 30:12.660]  Although it was interesting because of course,
[30:12.660 --> 30:15.620]  Apple somewhat famously does not have
[30:15.620 --> 30:18.220]  an official presence at CES.
[30:18.220 --> 30:21.520]  My guess is that some people from Apple go
[30:21.520 --> 30:22.740]  just to kind of look at stuff,
[30:22.740 --> 30:24.980]  they'll be kind of silly not to.
[30:24.980 --> 30:26.660]  Oh, I know for a fact that it,
[30:26.660 --> 30:29.820]  and even when Macworld was a thing and it was coincident
[30:29.820 --> 30:32.780]  that there were people from the product marketing group
[30:32.780 --> 30:35.900]  who went every year just to do the due diligence
[30:35.900 --> 30:36.980]  of walking around.
[30:37.860 --> 30:39.740]  And the question was always whether,
[30:39.740 --> 30:41.340]  what they would put on their badge.
[30:41.340 --> 30:44.080]  And most of the time, I think they just would officially go
[30:44.080 --> 30:45.460]  and they'd have Apple on the badge.
[30:45.460 --> 30:47.180]  And if people wanted to talk them up, they'd do it.
[30:47.180 --> 30:48.020]  They just didn't,
[30:49.020 --> 30:50.780]  and it wasn't real cloak and dagger stuff.
[30:50.780 --> 30:54.140]  They just, but they were there to just see what else
[30:55.540 --> 30:56.660]  the industry's doing.
[30:56.660 --> 30:59.200]  Yeah, I mean, it'd be foolish not to.
[30:59.200 --> 31:01.820]  I think that someone was telling me that they saw
[31:01.820 --> 31:06.820]  a couple Apple people this year just walking around,
[31:07.180 --> 31:08.340]  but I wasn't there for that.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.340]  Yeah, I wouldn't even be surprised
[31:09.340 --> 31:10.980]  if it's actually like multiple teams,
[31:10.980 --> 31:13.900]  like different, not even in coordination,
[31:13.900 --> 31:16.460]  the product marketing people that are just there in general,
[31:16.460 --> 31:18.660]  but maybe like notebook engineers are there
[31:18.660 --> 31:21.460]  just to look at all the crazy notebooks
[31:21.460 --> 31:23.680]  that are being put together.
[31:23.680 --> 31:24.660]  Yeah, I would.
[31:24.660 --> 31:26.460]  And then you get to be in Vegas.
[31:26.460 --> 31:28.100]  Right.
[31:28.100 --> 31:30.300]  And maybe run into Rupert Murdoch.
[31:30.300 --> 31:31.620]  He looked good.
[31:31.620 --> 31:34.300]  He was wearing a nice suit and some sneakers,
[31:34.300 --> 31:38.020]  walking down the hallway outside of a party
[31:38.020 --> 31:39.380]  that I was leaving.
[31:39.380 --> 31:41.100]  So it was just like in the hotel, you mean?
[31:41.100 --> 31:42.380]  Like a hallway?
[31:42.380 --> 31:45.500]  Yes, in the Wynn outside of one of their nightclub-y
[31:45.500 --> 31:47.060]  type venues.
[31:47.060 --> 31:48.660]  Huh.
[31:48.660 --> 31:49.780]  Crazy.
[31:49.780 --> 31:51.640]  Yeah, I mean. What time of day was that?
[31:51.640 --> 31:56.640]  This was around, I think, 11 p.m. or 10 something p.m.
[31:56.640 --> 32:00.960]  See, that's why you go to CES.
[32:00.960 --> 32:01.840]  Totally.
[32:01.840 --> 32:03.360]  Yeah, actually, I'll never forget.
[32:03.360 --> 32:07.440]  When I worked at Forbes, now almost 10 years ago,
[32:07.440 --> 32:10.400]  one of my colleagues wrote an article about,
[32:10.400 --> 32:13.400]  actually, it may have been CES 10 years ago
[32:13.400 --> 32:16.760]  where she was randomly at a booth
[32:16.760 --> 32:19.160]  when Bill Gates showed up to look at the booth
[32:19.160 --> 32:22.400]  and what an interesting and cool experience that was.
[32:22.400 --> 32:25.920]  Like, can you imagine being the tiny booth operator
[32:25.920 --> 32:28.360]  and then yoink, Bill Gates walks up and says,
[32:28.360 --> 32:29.600]  hey, give me a demo?
[32:31.600 --> 32:32.440]  I'll have to find that article.
[32:32.440 --> 32:34.440]  I wonder if Forbes has archived that.
[32:34.440 --> 32:36.600]  Have you ever worked at trade show booth?
[32:38.760 --> 32:40.180]  I don't think so.
[32:40.180 --> 32:42.600]  When I was a kid, my dad, I think,
[32:42.600 --> 32:45.420]  had a booth or like a part of one at some point
[32:45.420 --> 32:46.800]  for a store he was involved in,
[32:46.800 --> 32:49.180]  but I never had to work a booth.
[32:49.180 --> 32:53.040]  I did when I worked at Bare Bones so far for BB Edit
[32:53.040 --> 32:54.840]  and I guess Mailsmith even at the time.
[32:54.840 --> 32:59.600]  But we'd have a booth at Macworld and it is grueling.
[32:59.600 --> 33:03.680]  Sometimes though, it could be like, I don't know,
[33:03.680 --> 33:04.780]  it's like three in the afternoon
[33:04.780 --> 33:06.400]  and you've been on your feet since nine
[33:06.400 --> 33:09.480]  and you've been making the same pitch over and over again.
[33:09.480 --> 33:12.680]  And repetition has never been good for me.
[33:12.680 --> 33:13.800]  I mean, not that I'm not good at it,
[33:13.800 --> 33:15.100]  but I get bored quickly.
[33:15.100 --> 33:17.000]  But then all of a sudden, you meet somebody
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.780]  and somebody will tell you this amazing story
[33:18.780 --> 33:22.880]  of how BB Edit saved their website or something like that.
[33:22.880 --> 33:25.280]  And they just wanna thank you and you're just like,
[33:25.280 --> 33:27.500]  oh my God, that's amazing, you made my day.
[33:27.500 --> 33:30.700]  Let me go get Rich Segal and you can tell it to his face.
[33:30.700 --> 33:31.540]  That's great.
[33:33.240 --> 33:35.120]  But boy, it is hard, it is really hard.
[33:35.120 --> 33:36.120]  And you can just see it.
[33:36.120 --> 33:39.200]  Now it's just a funny thing to have
[33:39.200 --> 33:40.560]  under my belt this experience.
[33:40.560 --> 33:42.480]  And now whenever I'm at a trade show and I walk around,
[33:42.480 --> 33:47.160]  I have a sympathy for every single person doing those,
[33:47.160 --> 33:50.000]  working those booths that I wouldn't have had otherwise.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.280]  Yeah, it's grueling and you have like a trade show
[33:53.280 --> 33:56.520]  approved vendors that you have to do everything with
[33:56.520 --> 34:01.520]  and good luck, there's a 20 minute line for the bathroom.
[34:04.560 --> 34:07.320]  So what else, what else did you do at CES?
[34:07.320 --> 34:12.240]  Oh, I hung out with Walt Mossberg, that was a highlight.
[34:12.240 --> 34:13.080]  I saw that.
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.600]  That's when you were texting me.
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.120]  I saw Periscope, this is my perspective, it's, oh,
[34:20.120 --> 34:23.840]  I think it might've been like maybe like 1230 at night,
[34:23.840 --> 34:26.680]  East Coast time, so it would have been maybe like 930 Vegas.
[34:26.680 --> 34:27.680]  That sound about right?
[34:27.680 --> 34:28.520]  I think so, yeah.
[34:28.520 --> 34:31.280]  And I saw somebody who I follow on Twitter from The Verge
[34:32.280 --> 34:35.160]  tweeted a link to Periscope that they're Periscoping
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.640]  from inside a blinged out, a crazy blinged out limo
[34:39.640 --> 34:43.000]  that Neil had rented for some unknown reason.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.240]  And I thought, I gotta see this,
[34:44.240 --> 34:47.320]  cause I don't, I know what a regular limo looks like.
[34:47.320 --> 34:49.560]  I gotta see what like a special,
[34:49.560 --> 34:51.600]  you know, call attention to it limo looks like.
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.920]  So I put the Periscope on and it's a Nilay
[34:53.920 --> 34:56.320]  and a couple of other people I knew from The Verge.
[34:56.320 --> 34:58.600]  And the inside of this limo, it really was like,
[34:58.600 --> 35:02.520]  it was like all the leftover neon from old Las Vegas
[35:02.520 --> 35:04.600]  was all inside this limo.
[35:04.600 --> 35:05.440]  Basically.
[35:05.440 --> 35:07.160]  And then the Periscope is panning around
[35:07.160 --> 35:08.360]  and here's Verge staffers.
[35:08.360 --> 35:10.320]  And I was just about ready to disconnect
[35:10.320 --> 35:11.160]  cause it's a buoyant.
[35:11.160 --> 35:12.760]  And then I see a guy and I was like, holy shit,
[35:12.760 --> 35:14.440]  that one guy looks like Dan Fromer.
[35:14.440 --> 35:15.920]  And I was like, who is that?
[35:15.920 --> 35:18.320]  And then they're like, and we've got Dan from Quartz
[35:18.320 --> 35:20.840]  and I'm like, holy shit, it is Dan Fromer.
[35:20.840 --> 35:21.680]  And I was like, wow.
[35:21.680 --> 35:23.840]  And now it was like, now I have a friend in the limo.
[35:23.840 --> 35:25.360]  Now I'm interested.
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.180]  And I noticed, it seemed to me like everybody
[35:27.180 --> 35:31.160]  was a little tipsy and you were like, just totally normal.
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.040]  And then it got crazier because then it got to the far side
[35:36.040 --> 35:38.000]  of this, it was a truly massive limo.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.520]  And then all of a sudden Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher
[35:40.520 --> 35:41.800]  were in there.
[35:41.800 --> 35:44.260]  Yeah, they were riding in the back seat.
[35:45.400 --> 35:47.400]  And I was fascinated.
[35:48.640 --> 35:49.480]  What were you guys doing?
[35:49.480 --> 35:52.320]  You guys were on your way from like one end of the strip
[35:52.320 --> 35:53.920]  to the other?
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.680]  We were all at a dinner that they have,
[35:59.580 --> 36:02.960]  usually the last night or one of the last nights every year,
[36:02.960 --> 36:04.680]  a kind of a press dinner.
[36:04.680 --> 36:09.680]  And I guess we were all going to the Cosmopolitan
[36:09.680 --> 36:12.660]  where there was a Twitter Spotify party.
[36:13.540 --> 36:15.500]  And rather than taking four cabs,
[36:15.500 --> 36:18.500]  Neil, I think threw his hands up and said, let's get a limo.
[36:19.580 --> 36:24.580]  So I just went in the limo and yeah, that was it.
[36:24.680 --> 36:27.580]  I mean, it wasn't, I don't think it was pre-planned
[36:27.580 --> 36:29.500]  or anything, it just happened.
[36:29.500 --> 36:30.500]  It was funny though.
[36:32.220 --> 36:33.520]  But it's the sort of thing that happens.
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.220]  Like what do you say on a periscope
[36:35.220 --> 36:37.060]  when they put the camera on your face?
[36:37.060 --> 36:38.220]  Oh, I never know what to say.
[36:38.220 --> 36:40.260]  I never, I don't know what to say.
[36:40.260 --> 36:41.220]  It was funny though.
[36:42.460 --> 36:44.940]  There were like 300 people watching.
[36:44.940 --> 36:49.340]  I enjoy periscope, but it requires a certain personality
[36:49.340 --> 36:53.100]  that I am not in possession of to really be good at it.
[36:54.100 --> 36:57.160]  I haven't done, I don't think I've ever done one.
[36:57.160 --> 36:58.780]  The other problem I have with it,
[36:58.780 --> 37:00.720]  last time I tried using it, I think I tried using it
[37:00.720 --> 37:03.020]  when the Pope was in town here in Philly
[37:03.020 --> 37:05.020]  and I was doing some periscopes walking around
[37:05.020 --> 37:09.540]  at the crazy ways that they'd shut down
[37:09.540 --> 37:12.020]  enormous major thoroughfares in Philly,
[37:12.020 --> 37:13.880]  which created this, it was awesome.
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.020]  But it's like you had these like six, seven lane streets
[37:18.020 --> 37:21.040]  that were entirely free of cars, not even like parked cars.
[37:21.040 --> 37:21.880]  It was great.
[37:22.900 --> 37:25.000]  But the problem for me is I've got so many Twitter followers
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.780]  that I easily overflow the limits of periscope,
[37:28.780 --> 37:30.620]  even just for something like that.
[37:30.620 --> 37:35.620]  And, hmm, did you recently join Snapchat?
[37:36.980 --> 37:38.600]  I did, that was me.
[37:38.600 --> 37:39.540]  That was you?
[37:39.540 --> 37:40.380]  Yeah.
[37:40.380 --> 37:42.380]  Okay, I was like, oh, that's weird.
[37:42.380 --> 37:43.940]  Do you understand Snapchat?
[37:43.940 --> 37:47.840]  No, no, and someone was, and this, I'm not that old,
[37:47.840 --> 37:48.860]  but I sound like it.
[37:48.860 --> 37:51.460]  I mean, someone was showing it to me the other day
[37:51.460 --> 37:55.260]  and I don't think I've ever posted anything
[37:55.260 --> 37:58.580]  because I just don't really know what to post or how.
[37:58.580 --> 38:02.180]  I guess the whole idea is that it's kind of very raw,
[38:02.180 --> 38:06.040]  uncut, like spur of the moment, life through your eyes,
[38:06.040 --> 38:08.860]  whereas I'm more of a retouch, edit,
[38:08.860 --> 38:10.720]  like frame the perfect,
[38:12.140 --> 38:14.380]  I'd say I'm more of an Instagram person
[38:14.380 --> 38:15.800]  than a Snapchat person.
[38:16.740 --> 38:19.840]  Me too, my understanding of Snapchat previously
[38:19.840 --> 38:23.700]  was that it was like a texting service
[38:23.700 --> 38:26.380]  where everything was ephemeral and nothing gets saved
[38:26.380 --> 38:29.340]  and everybody, ha ha, you can send dick pics.
[38:29.340 --> 38:30.860]  But people did use it for that,
[38:30.860 --> 38:32.580]  but then like teenagers could use it
[38:32.580 --> 38:34.980]  and send like love notes to each other
[38:34.980 --> 38:37.980]  and know that they're gonna be disappeared by the next day.
[38:37.980 --> 38:39.860]  And that made sense to me
[38:39.860 --> 38:43.100]  and I felt like I understand what this product does
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.540]  and I'm not a teenager anymore.
[38:44.540 --> 38:46.980]  I have no need for it, so I didn't know it.
[38:46.980 --> 38:49.460]  But then I've heard, now it's more like a social network
[38:49.460 --> 38:51.060]  and see what turned me onto it was,
[38:51.060 --> 38:52.980]  do you know who Gary Vaynerchuk is?
[38:52.980 --> 38:54.680]  Yes.
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.980]  Gary Vaynerchuk has been raving about it lately
[38:57.980 --> 39:00.540]  and he's been saying that he hasn't been this excited
[39:00.540 --> 39:03.500]  about something since Twitter circa 2007.
[39:03.500 --> 39:04.860]  And he really was, I do remember,
[39:04.860 --> 39:05.900]  that's when I first met Gary
[39:05.900 --> 39:09.780]  and Gary was huge on Twitter in like 2006, 2007,
[39:09.780 --> 39:11.680]  said this thing is gonna blow up, it's gonna be huge,
[39:11.680 --> 39:14.260]  everybody's gonna be on Twitter and he was right.
[39:14.260 --> 39:17.700]  And so him saying that this is how he feels about Snapchat
[39:17.700 --> 39:19.980]  made me think, well, I should sign up for this
[39:19.980 --> 39:22.100]  and see if I can figure it out.
[39:22.100 --> 39:24.380]  And so I did and there's a part of the process
[39:24.380 --> 39:27.300]  where it's like, do you want us to notify,
[39:27.300 --> 39:30.780]  here's people you know from your address book,
[39:30.780 --> 39:31.640]  do you wanna follow them?
[39:31.640 --> 39:34.260]  And I did and you're not the first person who's asked,
[39:34.260 --> 39:35.260]  is this really you?
[39:36.460 --> 39:38.500]  Because I guess it seems a little surprising
[39:38.500 --> 39:40.580]  that I would sign up for Snapchat.
[39:40.580 --> 39:42.340]  Well, it's also under the name of the site
[39:42.340 --> 39:44.340]  and not as your name.
[39:44.340 --> 39:46.820]  Oh, right, and that was because...
[39:48.180 --> 39:50.500]  You might be a little late to get the Gruber name on Snapchat.
[39:50.500 --> 39:52.140]  Yeah, I couldn't get it
[39:52.140 --> 39:55.940]  and all the variations on Gruber weren't there.
[39:55.940 --> 40:00.020]  And I also had the notion that if it does become a thing,
[40:00.020 --> 40:02.700]  maybe it would be more of a daring fireball thing
[40:02.700 --> 40:04.080]  than a personal thing.
[40:04.080 --> 40:06.460]  Yeah, it actually would not be...
[40:06.460 --> 40:09.100]  It's kind of like Periscope in the same way.
[40:09.100 --> 40:14.100]  It's like, here's a kind of unedited view of life
[40:14.100 --> 40:18.740]  maybe from the WWDC press bullpen or something like that.
[40:18.740 --> 40:20.020]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
[40:20.020 --> 40:20.980]  But I didn't even get the right
[40:20.980 --> 40:22.420]  daring fireball name either, right?
[40:22.420 --> 40:23.260]  Oh, really?
[40:23.260 --> 40:25.140]  I think there's like I had to put like a dash in it
[40:25.140 --> 40:25.980]  or something, I don't know.
[40:25.980 --> 40:27.980]  Because I don't know who the shitbag is,
[40:27.980 --> 40:30.600]  but some jerk has daring fireball.
[40:32.120 --> 40:33.820]  Like that can't possibly be legit.
[40:33.820 --> 40:35.620]  Like whoever it is stole it from me.
[40:36.540 --> 40:38.620]  Well, did you see on Peach?
[40:38.620 --> 40:39.820]  Have you used Peach yet?
[40:39.820 --> 40:41.500]  Yeah, I'm on the Peach.
[40:41.500 --> 40:43.040]  I'm on the Peach.
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.540]  Someone has Casey Johnston got P. Marka.
[40:47.540 --> 40:51.100]  So she's peaching it up.
[40:51.100 --> 40:52.020]  Is she really?
[40:52.020 --> 40:52.860]  Yeah.
[40:55.540 --> 40:58.620]  Is she masquerading as she put?
[40:58.620 --> 41:00.180]  I think just the username.
[41:00.180 --> 41:03.380]  I actually haven't looked at it in a couple days.
[41:03.380 --> 41:06.740]  The Peach is really weird, I think.
[41:06.740 --> 41:08.820]  So what happened, for anybody who missed this,
[41:08.820 --> 41:10.420]  and trust me, if you did,
[41:10.420 --> 41:12.300]  you're not really missing anything.
[41:12.300 --> 41:13.560]  It was like over the weekend,
[41:13.560 --> 41:14.580]  I think it was over the weekend,
[41:14.580 --> 41:16.100]  but within the last few days,
[41:16.100 --> 41:17.700]  all of a sudden, everybody on Twitter is talking
[41:17.700 --> 41:19.700]  about a new social network called Peach.
[41:19.700 --> 41:21.880]  And in fact, the fact that I just tried
[41:21.880 --> 41:24.620]  to get my name on Snapchat and couldn't,
[41:24.620 --> 41:26.840]  I do have this habit where if I hear of a new social network,
[41:26.840 --> 41:28.740]  even if I think there's a very low chance I wanna do it,
[41:28.740 --> 41:31.820]  I'll quick sign up to try to get a username that I want.
[41:31.820 --> 41:33.780]  And so I signed up for this Peach.
[41:33.780 --> 41:37.060]  And it's, as best as I can figure out,
[41:37.060 --> 41:38.980]  number one, I don't quite get it.
[41:38.980 --> 41:40.220]  But as best as I can figure it out,
[41:40.220 --> 41:42.200]  is it's sorta like Twitter,
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.100]  except that instead of getting a timeline,
[41:44.100 --> 41:47.580]  you have to go to every single person you follow
[41:47.580 --> 41:49.580]  individually to see what they're up to.
[41:50.580 --> 41:55.180]  And it's a poor idea for a social network implemented
[41:55.180 --> 41:58.860]  in a very poorly made and designed app.
[41:58.860 --> 42:01.700]  Like the buttons in the app, you tap the button
[42:01.700 --> 42:04.540]  and there's no visual indication that you've tapped it.
[42:04.540 --> 42:05.580]  There's no highlight.
[42:05.580 --> 42:09.340]  And to make it even worse, nothing happens sometimes.
[42:09.340 --> 42:12.480]  And then you tap it again and it's gone
[42:12.480 --> 42:14.900]  because whatever it is that you tapped to do before,
[42:14.900 --> 42:17.500]  it took three seconds and then it went away.
[42:17.500 --> 42:18.900]  It's a very, very shitty app.
[42:21.140 --> 42:21.980]  It's interesting.
[42:21.980 --> 42:24.900]  It's, I mean, it's actually,
[42:24.900 --> 42:28.260]  as Twitter starts to add more,
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.220]  I don't know what you would call them,
[42:29.220 --> 42:32.300]  formats or something, media types to Twitter,
[42:32.300 --> 42:35.720]  this is kind of like going a giant leap ahead of that
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.120]  because you can make drawings, you can make animations,
[42:39.120 --> 42:40.900]  you can add photos.
[42:40.900 --> 42:43.460]  But the timeline is weird.
[42:43.460 --> 42:45.860]  It's not a timeline of posts.
[42:45.860 --> 42:48.560]  It's a timeline of people.
[42:48.560 --> 42:51.860]  So one of the more interesting analyses I read
[42:51.860 --> 42:56.860]  basically said, you're incentivized to just post
[42:57.060 --> 42:59.180]  as much as possible because then you'll always be
[42:59.180 --> 43:00.440]  at the top of the timeline.
[43:00.440 --> 43:03.140]  And you won't be spamming people in the sense
[43:03.140 --> 43:05.420]  that they'll see 20 of your posts in a row,
[43:05.420 --> 43:09.420]  but you'll always be the person at the top of the timeline
[43:09.420 --> 43:10.940]  and that might get annoying.
[43:10.940 --> 43:11.780]  I don't know.
[43:13.900 --> 43:15.680]  I don't think it's worth talking about much more.
[43:15.680 --> 43:16.580]  No, let's not.
[43:16.580 --> 43:19.380]  As with any new social network, most of the posts,
[43:19.380 --> 43:22.800]  well, not most, but many of the posts are about Peach itself.
[43:22.800 --> 43:23.640]  Yeah.
[43:23.640 --> 43:25.660]  So we'll see if it gets beyond that.
[43:25.660 --> 43:28.440]  What's interesting about it is that it's made by,
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.040]  one of the people who made it is the guy who made Vine.
[43:31.040 --> 43:31.880]  So. Right.
[43:33.180 --> 43:35.060]  That's the only reason it got any kind of traction
[43:35.060 --> 43:37.300]  because Vine is a real thing and there's real people
[43:37.300 --> 43:41.480]  who are, you know, using it happily and it's, you know,
[43:41.480 --> 43:42.660]  but I don't think this is a Vine.
[43:42.660 --> 43:46.020]  Or unless it, they somehow quote unquote pivot
[43:46.020 --> 43:48.660]  and invent a new, something new that you can do with this
[43:48.660 --> 43:50.740]  that's different than what this is.
[43:50.740 --> 43:52.420]  Yeah. It's always dangerous to say like,
[43:52.420 --> 43:53.740]  there's been too many of,
[43:53.740 --> 43:56.460]  there's been too many social networks because,
[43:56.460 --> 44:00.240]  I'm sure someone said there were too many search engines
[44:00.240 --> 44:01.860]  right before Google came out.
[44:01.860 --> 44:04.860]  So, you know, who knows what's actually gonna happen,
[44:04.860 --> 44:06.500]  but it seems like this is one of those things
[44:06.500 --> 44:11.180]  where it's just not different enough to really justify
[44:11.180 --> 44:13.780]  putting too much time and effort into.
[44:13.780 --> 44:16.820]  Maybe it'll catch on among some,
[44:16.820 --> 44:20.040]  like Path was huge in Singapore or something or.
[44:20.040 --> 44:22.100]  Oh yeah. Indonesia or wherever.
[44:23.940 --> 44:24.780]  But yeah.
[44:26.460 --> 44:28.220]  We'll stop talking about Peach now.
[44:28.220 --> 44:29.060]  Yeah. All right.
[44:29.060 --> 44:30.420]  Well, we'll stop talking about Peach
[44:30.420 --> 44:33.440]  and start talking about our next sponsor.
[44:33.440 --> 44:36.660]  And it's our good friends at Squarespace.
[44:36.660 --> 44:37.580]  You guys know Squarespace.
[44:37.580 --> 44:41.420]  It's the all-in-one service that lets you,
[44:41.420 --> 44:44.900]  handles everything you need to have your own website.
[44:44.900 --> 44:46.580]  They do the hosting.
[44:46.580 --> 44:50.860]  They have the templates that you can use to start.
[44:50.860 --> 44:54.220]  You just start with a website that is gorgeous,
[44:54.220 --> 44:55.900]  but, and they have templates
[44:55.900 --> 44:58.580]  for all sorts of different types of websites.
[44:58.580 --> 45:00.140]  If you're setting up an online store,
[45:00.140 --> 45:02.440]  they have a whole bunch of store designs to choose from.
[45:02.440 --> 45:03.860]  If you're setting up a portfolio,
[45:03.860 --> 45:06.080]  because let's say maybe you're a designer
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.140]  and you want to create a new portfolio site
[45:09.140 --> 45:10.420]  to show off your work.
[45:10.420 --> 45:12.060]  They've got examples of that.
[45:12.060 --> 45:15.120]  It's really, really easy.
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.360]  And it is so far beyond any kind of website.
[45:18.360 --> 45:21.540]  Even if you're thinking that you're going to have to
[45:21.540 --> 45:24.220]  design it or program it from scratch, you know,
[45:24.220 --> 45:25.940]  the old fashioned traditional way,
[45:25.940 --> 45:27.900]  the stick shift way, if you will,
[45:27.900 --> 45:30.720]  the manual transition where you're writing the code
[45:30.720 --> 45:32.500]  and designing it and doing the HTML,
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.700]  or maybe it's the programming.
[45:33.700 --> 45:36.060]  You really ought to think about trying it first
[45:36.060 --> 45:39.180]  with Squarespace, even if you can think of it as a prototype
[45:39.180 --> 45:41.380]  and I, for a lot of different types of sites,
[45:41.380 --> 45:44.300]  you'd be very surprised just how far you can go.
[45:44.300 --> 45:46.420]  And you may not need to build a website.
[45:46.420 --> 45:48.860]  You really can just use Squarespace.
[45:50.500 --> 45:52.260]  I was actually looking around with it recently.
[45:52.260 --> 45:53.500]  I actually, cause I thought, you know,
[45:53.500 --> 45:55.500]  these guys sponsor the show all the time
[45:55.500 --> 45:57.180]  and I haven't looked at it in a while.
[45:57.180 --> 45:58.980]  And I know they had a major new version last weekend.
[45:58.980 --> 46:00.860]  So I tried building just to, you know,
[46:00.860 --> 46:04.180]  just spend like an hour building like a little store design.
[46:04.180 --> 46:07.460]  And I was blown away by how much improved it is
[46:07.460 --> 46:08.820]  from the way Squarespace used to be.
[46:08.820 --> 46:11.860]  Just how much more it feels like you're working in,
[46:11.860 --> 46:13.720]  even though you're in a browser doing all this stuff,
[46:13.720 --> 46:16.180]  it really feels like you're in like an app,
[46:16.180 --> 46:18.660]  like a design app doing these things.
[46:18.660 --> 46:19.940]  Really, really impressive.
[46:20.980 --> 46:22.340]  Where do you go to find out more?
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.620]  Easy, go to squarespace.com and you'll get a free trial,
[46:26.620 --> 46:27.980]  no credit card required.
[46:27.980 --> 46:31.260]  And then when you do pay, when the free trial is up
[46:31.260 --> 46:33.100]  and you want to keep the site and keep it going,
[46:33.100 --> 46:35.820]  just remember the offer code, Gruber, my last name,
[46:35.820 --> 46:40.820]  G-R-U-B-E-R, and you will get 10% off your first purchase.
[46:40.900 --> 46:42.780]  That could be a lot of dough because if you pay
[46:42.780 --> 46:45.380]  for a whole year at a time,
[46:45.380 --> 46:47.300]  the 10% can apply right to that.
[46:47.300 --> 46:50.540]  So my thanks to Squarespace, build it beautiful.
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.140]  One more thing I want to say about CES.
[46:55.140 --> 46:58.100]  Now having been twice, all the,
[46:58.100 --> 47:01.020]  this was a different Apple that back then it was smaller
[47:01.020 --> 47:05.060]  and still, I would say maybe a little more mysterious,
[47:05.060 --> 47:09.620]  but all the so-called rumors and like calls for Apple
[47:09.620 --> 47:13.160]  to headline CES and all that stuff,
[47:13.160 --> 47:15.500]  that was just completely idiotic.
[47:15.500 --> 47:19.020]  Like even now more in hindsight than it seemed then.
[47:19.020 --> 47:22.380]  Like there's no way that Apple is gonna waste their time
[47:22.380 --> 47:25.820]  trying to like have any sort of signal
[47:25.820 --> 47:27.500]  among the noise at CES.
[47:27.500 --> 47:30.460]  There's absolutely no reason for them to do that.
[47:30.460 --> 47:33.380]  And just like even halfway believing
[47:33.380 --> 47:35.180]  that that could have happened back then
[47:35.180 --> 47:37.660]  just seems completely foolish now.
[47:37.660 --> 47:41.780]  I miss Mac world and I really do.
[47:41.780 --> 47:42.860]  And it's heyday, it was great.
[47:42.860 --> 47:44.060]  And it was for exactly what you said though.
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.540]  It's that it was a way,
[47:46.540 --> 47:48.440]  the main reason was just the fact that everybody
[47:48.440 --> 47:51.420]  who covered Apple or worked in Apple related things
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.140]  was all in San Francisco at the exact same time,
[47:55.140 --> 47:56.560]  which was great.
[47:56.560 --> 47:58.160]  And then secondarily, it was great.
[47:58.160 --> 47:59.000]  It was actually great.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.540]  So every year I'd find one or two things,
[48:01.540 --> 48:03.380]  new companies of making products
[48:03.380 --> 48:05.940]  that I didn't know otherwise.
[48:05.940 --> 48:07.940]  And even in the internet era,
[48:07.940 --> 48:12.540]  when that became a lot easier to find little companies
[48:12.540 --> 48:16.040]  that are from oddball locations around the world,
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.060]  it still always happened.
[48:18.060 --> 48:20.280]  But I totally understand why Apple pulled the plug
[48:20.280 --> 48:21.660]  on their involvement in Mac world,
[48:21.660 --> 48:24.060]  which was way less involved than it would have been
[48:24.060 --> 48:25.860]  if they'd gone to CES, right?
[48:25.860 --> 48:28.140]  Cause Mac world, especially the San Francisco one,
[48:28.140 --> 48:30.720]  which was the last show was local to them.
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.720]  And it, the entire show revolved around their ecosystem,
[48:37.020 --> 48:39.020]  but I totally understand why they got away from it.
[48:39.020 --> 48:40.620]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised
[48:40.620 --> 48:44.540]  if like someone took a meeting with someone from CEA
[48:44.540 --> 48:46.480]  or whatever and heard them out,
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.220]  but there's just no, you know, Apple can command
[48:50.220 --> 48:53.380]  as much attention as it gets on its own.
[48:53.380 --> 48:56.320]  Why would it participate in something
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.620]  that's gonna be super noisy and not focused?
[49:00.620 --> 49:02.980]  Yeah, and the thing, and Apple,
[49:02.980 --> 49:04.780]  I think actually was upfront about this.
[49:04.780 --> 49:07.020]  I don't, I think when they stopped, they, you know,
[49:07.020 --> 49:08.700]  publicly said, we're not, this is the last time
[49:08.700 --> 49:10.760]  we're gonna do a Mac world keynote.
[49:10.760 --> 49:15.760]  It was the year that, it was the year when Steve Jobs
[49:17.580 --> 49:21.060]  fell ill again and ended up going on a medical leave.
[49:21.060 --> 49:25.020]  And he, you know, he, they announced like his medical leave,
[49:25.020 --> 49:27.060]  I forget, it was like December, January.
[49:28.820 --> 49:30.820]  But they said that, you know,
[49:30.820 --> 49:33.380]  Very messily, if you recall.
[49:33.380 --> 49:36.740]  It was handled very poorly, probably because of Steve,
[49:36.740 --> 49:40.420]  you know, that it was his desire for privacy
[49:40.420 --> 49:44.940]  was in direct conflict with the company's need to,
[49:44.940 --> 49:47.500]  they, A, they were giving a keynote at Mac world expo
[49:47.500 --> 49:50.300]  in early January and B, you know,
[49:50.300 --> 49:51.740]  they have certain public obligations
[49:51.740 --> 49:53.740]  regarding the executive leadership.
[49:53.740 --> 49:54.880]  It was all very messy.
[49:56.380 --> 49:58.420]  It's all, you know, obviously it's a moot point now,
[49:58.420 --> 50:01.780]  but I remember though that the, it was announced that
[50:01.780 --> 50:04.340]  A, Phil Schiller will be giving the keynote
[50:04.340 --> 50:06.540]  at Mac world next month and B,
[50:06.540 --> 50:08.380]  this will be the last keynote Apple ever gives
[50:08.380 --> 50:09.540]  at Mac world expo.
[50:09.540 --> 50:13.820]  So they announced that before the Mac world expo,
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.300]  which was in some,
[50:15.300 --> 50:17.300]  some people took that as sort of a Dick move
[50:17.300 --> 50:20.820]  cause it kind of did cast a funereal
[50:21.780 --> 50:23.020]  feel to the whole thing.
[50:23.020 --> 50:24.900]  Cause I gave it, I mean, they were, you know,
[50:24.900 --> 50:26.860]  they still had at least two more Mac worlds after that,
[50:26.860 --> 50:29.460]  but everybody knew at this point that it was going to be a,
[50:29.460 --> 50:32.240]  a greatly diminished Mac world without Apple.
[50:32.240 --> 50:33.820]  But on the other hand, I kind of think,
[50:33.820 --> 50:36.160]  I don't know that it was a Dick move pre-announcing that
[50:36.160 --> 50:39.140]  because I think it gave everybody a chance to soak it up.
[50:39.140 --> 50:40.940]  And it maybe gave people who were like,
[50:40.940 --> 50:42.700]  eh, maybe I'll go, maybe I'll not go.
[50:42.700 --> 50:45.540]  It motivated them to, yeah, I better go.
[50:45.540 --> 50:47.220]  Yeah, that was the only year I went.
[50:47.220 --> 50:51.180]  And it was, it was really cool to be able to see it once.
[50:54.840 --> 50:56.980]  Anything else from CES?
[50:56.980 --> 50:57.820]  I don't think so.
[50:57.820 --> 51:00.220]  I mean, you know, I could go on forever.
[51:00.220 --> 51:02.180]  It was, it was really interesting.
[51:03.060 --> 51:03.900]  It was fun.
[51:03.900 --> 51:05.160]  It was exhausting.
[51:05.160 --> 51:07.900]  And next year you're coming so we can,
[51:07.900 --> 51:10.740]  so someone will play blackjack with me.
[51:10.740 --> 51:12.060]  I can't believe you didn't play any blackjack.
[51:12.060 --> 51:13.500]  How do you not find time for blackjack?
[51:13.500 --> 51:16.020]  Cause it would be like 2 a.m. and I hadn't,
[51:16.020 --> 51:19.140]  you know, it was like, oh, I guess I should go to sleep.
[51:19.140 --> 51:20.380]  See you.
[51:20.380 --> 51:22.100]  Cause the people, you know, the people I was with,
[51:22.100 --> 51:26.440]  they either just want to keep drinking or I don't know.
[51:26.440 --> 51:27.380]  I actually don't know.
[51:27.380 --> 51:29.740]  And there's like some, I think it started ironically,
[51:29.740 --> 51:32.260]  but there's like a lot of the tech writers
[51:32.260 --> 51:35.700]  play piegowl poker, which I also didn't get to play.
[51:35.700 --> 51:38.700]  We were going to, and then I got separated from that group.
[51:38.700 --> 51:42.300]  And I don't know if they ever did or not, but anyway,
[51:42.300 --> 51:43.840]  next year.
[51:43.840 --> 51:46.340]  See that I'm starting to get a sense of how this could
[51:46.340 --> 51:48.980]  happen and why it's inexplicable to me,
[51:48.980 --> 51:51.180]  how you can have like a four day trip to Vegas
[51:51.180 --> 51:52.480]  and not end up playing blackjack.
[51:52.480 --> 51:54.300]  And it sounds to me, and I know you,
[51:54.300 --> 51:55.460]  I think this is probably true.
[51:55.460 --> 51:58.900]  It seems to me that the difference is that you have at least
[51:58.900 --> 52:00.480]  a lick of common sense.
[52:02.220 --> 52:03.740]  I don't know.
[52:03.740 --> 52:04.580]  I don't know.
[52:04.580 --> 52:07.900]  I was, yeah, no, I would have liked to,
[52:08.980 --> 52:10.180]  like last year I was like, oh,
[52:10.180 --> 52:11.300]  I'll just do it the last night.
[52:11.300 --> 52:13.620]  And then the last night it was like 1am and I,
[52:13.620 --> 52:16.540]  I couldn't even put a hundred bucks on the Cubs to win the
[52:16.540 --> 52:17.620]  world series last year.
[52:17.620 --> 52:20.060]  Cause I ran out of time before the sports book closed.
[52:20.060 --> 52:21.760]  Oh, did you get it in this year?
[52:21.760 --> 52:22.600]  No.
[52:22.600 --> 52:24.460]  Or are they not taking, are they not taking those yet?
[52:24.460 --> 52:25.300]  I don't know.
[52:25.300 --> 52:26.620]  I'm sure they're taking them.
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.120]  I don't know.
[52:29.120 --> 52:30.720]  I guess they probably could win this year.
[52:30.720 --> 52:32.460]  I didn't think they were going to win.
[52:32.460 --> 52:34.740]  I didn't think they were going to be even close last year.
[52:34.740 --> 52:36.980]  So they're going to be, I think they're going to be good.
[52:36.980 --> 52:38.200]  They're going to be good.
[52:38.200 --> 52:40.180]  Are they going to be the national league favorites?
[52:40.180 --> 52:43.300]  Maybe could be because it's going to be cardinals have
[52:43.300 --> 52:44.140]  gotten worse.
[52:44.140 --> 52:45.700]  Cardinals have gotten more in the Mets.
[52:45.700 --> 52:46.540]  Come on the Mets.
[52:46.540 --> 52:47.360]  That was a fluke.
[52:47.360 --> 52:48.320]  The Mets have gotten worse already.
[52:48.320 --> 52:50.580]  The Mets have already lost, lost talent.
[52:50.580 --> 52:53.340]  And I don't think they're going to sign cesspitus.
[52:53.340 --> 52:55.940]  They they've metal have pitching and that's it.
[52:55.940 --> 52:58.160]  And then the Dodgers are in turmoil, right?
[52:58.160 --> 52:59.000]  And nobody,
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.340]  I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen with the
[53:00.340 --> 53:02.140]  Dodgers and they're probably worse because they,
[53:02.140 --> 53:03.700]  they lost a what's his name?
[53:03.700 --> 53:04.540]  The pitcher.
[53:05.780 --> 53:08.700]  Oh, uh, what's his name?
[53:09.760 --> 53:11.320]  The guy who used to be on the Royals.
[53:11.320 --> 53:12.160]  Yeah.
[53:12.160 --> 53:13.780]  I forgot.
[53:13.780 --> 53:15.460]  So anyway, I think your cubbies are going to be,
[53:15.460 --> 53:16.780]  I don't think you're going to get good odds.
[53:16.780 --> 53:17.620]  This could be a year.
[53:17.620 --> 53:19.020]  Yeah. That's the thing.
[53:19.020 --> 53:20.420]  It could be the year where you get your,
[53:20.420 --> 53:22.840]  you get your Cubs win the world series ticket and you end up
[53:22.840 --> 53:25.740]  winning like $600 on a hundred dollar bet.
[53:25.740 --> 53:28.300]  Not even, I think it's like four to one or something right
[53:28.300 --> 53:31.020]  now. I think last year it was seven to one.
[53:31.020 --> 53:32.060]  That just doesn't seem right.
[53:32.060 --> 53:33.880]  It seems like even when the Cubs have talent,
[53:33.880 --> 53:36.700]  the Cubs ought to have, there ought to be like, yeah,
[53:36.700 --> 53:37.540]  they're the Cubs.
[53:37.540 --> 53:38.380]  There ought to be like a,
[53:38.380 --> 53:41.260]  they're the Cubs discount on the tickets.
[53:41.260 --> 53:42.100]  And the same way with,
[53:42.100 --> 53:44.500]  with the Yankees that even when the Yankees that look like
[53:44.500 --> 53:45.740]  they're not in a good spot, you know,
[53:45.740 --> 53:46.840]  they don't really have it.
[53:46.840 --> 53:49.340]  The Yankees still should only be like eight to one every
[53:49.340 --> 53:53.500]  year, even if they have no chance because of the Yankees,
[53:54.860 --> 53:55.700]  like you shouldn't really,
[53:55.700 --> 53:57.660]  you should not be able to make a lot of money by betting on
[53:57.660 --> 53:58.860]  the Yankees to win the world series.
[53:58.860 --> 54:00.860]  No, that's practically cheating.
[54:00.860 --> 54:01.700]  Right.
[54:04.580 --> 54:06.420]  That's why I love them.
[54:06.420 --> 54:08.340]  It's like betting on the house.
[54:08.340 --> 54:09.540]  Basically. Yeah.
[54:10.700 --> 54:12.060]  So anyway, basic gist of it.
[54:12.060 --> 54:14.820]  You go to, you go to CES, you go two days early or so,
[54:14.820 --> 54:15.900]  cause you want to go hit these,
[54:15.900 --> 54:17.900]  the keynotes and the announcements.
[54:17.900 --> 54:19.700]  And then you book two days,
[54:20.920 --> 54:23.000]  you stay there for two days to do the show floor.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.340]  Can you do the whole show floor in two days?
[54:25.340 --> 54:28.260]  You'll, you'll never get, you'll never do the whole thing.
[54:28.260 --> 54:29.660]  You have to pick and choose.
[54:29.660 --> 54:33.100]  Even we didn't get to talking about more than one tiny
[54:33.100 --> 54:34.180]  portion of it.
[54:34.180 --> 54:35.620]  There's the whole convention center,
[54:35.620 --> 54:38.740]  which is like the North central and South halls,
[54:38.740 --> 54:41.380]  each of which have multiple zones.
[54:42.220 --> 54:43.860]  And then there's the West gate too,
[54:43.860 --> 54:45.460]  which is something else I don't even know.
[54:45.460 --> 54:47.100]  I didn't even go to the West gate.
[54:47.100 --> 54:48.380]  I don't know. What the hell is that?
[54:48.380 --> 54:49.660]  That's something else.
[54:49.660 --> 54:50.880]  It's like next door.
[54:52.200 --> 54:53.240]  I've seen the sign.
[54:53.240 --> 54:54.620]  I don't even know what it is though.
[54:54.620 --> 54:56.100]  Is it like a hotel casino?
[54:56.100 --> 54:59.160]  Yeah, I think it's kind of a junky casino hotel with its own
[54:59.160 --> 55:02.940]  convention center and part of CES is in there.
[55:02.940 --> 55:03.780]  Yeah.
[55:05.060 --> 55:06.140]  I think it's so crazy.
[55:06.140 --> 55:07.980]  I, I, I'm going next year.
[55:07.980 --> 55:08.940]  Yeah, you should.
[55:08.940 --> 55:09.780]  I should book it.
[55:09.780 --> 55:10.600]  Let's do it.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.440]  All right.
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.280]  Stay somewhere nice though.
[55:12.280 --> 55:14.260]  Well, I only stay at the Wynn.
[55:14.260 --> 55:15.500]  Oh, well, all right.
[55:16.700 --> 55:20.740]  That might be a pricey, but when I looked,
[55:20.740 --> 55:22.300]  well, when I looked at it, it had sold out,
[55:22.300 --> 55:24.940]  but I think before that let's all right,
[55:24.940 --> 55:27.660]  we'll figure out how to do this early so that we don't get
[55:27.660 --> 55:31.420]  screwed. But yeah, I wonder what the, I know that they sell,
[55:31.420 --> 55:34.260]  I know that the Wynn and Encore sell out because they're a,
[55:34.260 --> 55:38.520]  they're the best place on the strip and B it's at, I don't,
[55:38.520 --> 55:40.020]  well, there's no ideal location,
[55:40.020 --> 55:44.300]  but it's about as close to ideal as you can get because it's
[55:44.300 --> 55:47.260]  right across the street from the Venetian and the Palazzo,
[55:47.260 --> 55:49.020]  which is the, where the, the, the,
[55:49.020 --> 55:51.740]  that's the casino that's connected to the sands convention
[55:51.740 --> 55:52.580]  center.
[55:52.580 --> 55:56.780]  Yes. And so my guess is that the, you know, the first,
[55:56.780 --> 56:00.740]  like my hotels, the first night was, was $50. And the second,
[56:00.740 --> 56:05.620]  the third and fourth nights were $350. Wow. Yeah.
[56:05.740 --> 56:06.940]  It's like a huge,
[56:06.940 --> 56:11.940]  like just the difference between pre CES and where did you,
[56:12.420 --> 56:16.220]  where did you stay? Well, I stayed, I had to stay at the Flamingo. Oh,
[56:16.220 --> 56:18.380]  that's right. You told me that you did tell me that. Right.
[56:18.380 --> 56:22.700]  And the Flamingo is not, not that great at all. Pretty good location. Yeah.
[56:22.700 --> 56:26.760]  It was well located and it's on the monorail. So that was fine. It was fine.
[56:26.760 --> 56:31.060]  I mean, I stayed in the new tower and it was fine, but, uh,
[56:31.620 --> 56:35.220]  Hey, maybe next year by CES, we'll have the, the Las Vegas city notes.
[56:35.220 --> 56:39.420]  So you'll know where to, uh, where to actually hang out. Yeah.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.060]  Oh, I know where to hang out. Oh, you know where to hang out. Yeah.
[56:42.140 --> 56:45.620]  I should probably write the Las Vegas city notes. Did you see,
[56:45.620 --> 56:48.540]  I relaunched it now. You've been offline a lot lately. Yeah.
[56:49.100 --> 56:53.040]  If you go to city notes.co, uh, you know, as, uh,
[56:53.500 --> 56:56.500]  I think I, you know, talked about it on the show before, but yeah,
[56:56.500 --> 57:00.740]  the idea was that I was making these apps where, um, if you go,
[57:00.740 --> 57:04.660]  if you're traveling to a city and you just want a short list of like the cool
[57:04.660 --> 57:09.620]  stuff where your cool friend would take you and not the lame touristy stuff
[57:09.660 --> 57:14.540]  or like, you know, fancy, silly stuff, um,
[57:14.780 --> 57:18.020]  did I would just have this list for you. And I did a New York one and I had a
[57:18.020 --> 57:21.100]  San Francisco one and these were iPhone apps that I was selling in the app
[57:21.100 --> 57:25.600]  store. And, um, it was, you know, long story short,
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.460]  it was cumbersome to make and, uh,
[57:29.500 --> 57:33.660]  and update these apps as apps. And it was also not really, you know,
[57:33.780 --> 57:36.580]  the paid app model has, uh, as you know,
[57:36.900 --> 57:41.020]  is not a great business model for, for certain types of, uh, of content.
[57:41.020 --> 57:43.900]  So it's a website now it's city notes.co.
[57:43.900 --> 57:46.580]  I have a Tokyo and a Paris list up there.
[57:46.580 --> 57:48.280]  And so if you're going to those cities,
[57:48.280 --> 57:52.780]  check them out and I'm working on New York next and then probably Los
[57:52.780 --> 57:56.340]  Angeles. And, um, you know, it's working as a website.
[57:56.340 --> 58:00.740]  It's like free for me to update and keep current and,
[58:01.180 --> 58:05.540]  uh, we'll see what happens. But that's my little side project. Yeah. I'm,
[58:05.540 --> 58:08.780]  you know, we'll see what, we'll see what happens with it. But, uh,
[58:08.900 --> 58:12.740]  I just relaunched it about a month ago and so far so good.
[58:13.380 --> 58:17.700]  Excellent. Uh, what else is going on? Do you, how about this?
[58:17.700 --> 58:18.900]  Do you want to talk about this El Chapo?
[58:18.900 --> 58:23.500]  Yeah, I haven't read the Sean Penn thing yet.
[58:23.540 --> 58:27.220]  Did you? Uh, I did, but I didn't finish it. And it's, it,
[58:27.300 --> 58:28.500]  it's like the stupidest thing.
[58:28.500 --> 58:31.860]  It's like I couldn't remember which device I was reading it on and so I haven't
[58:31.860 --> 58:35.620]  gotten back to it, but I loved it. I thought it was fantastic. I really,
[58:35.620 --> 58:38.100]  really liked it. I'm going to read it tonight.
[58:38.180 --> 58:42.660]  I think it's one of the best pieces written by a non writer and there's,
[58:42.700 --> 58:46.020]  it's funny, it seems like maybe rolling stone. I,
[58:46.020 --> 58:48.940]  I'm not sure what the backstory is and I don't know how much of this,
[58:48.940 --> 58:51.660]  if it's out there and I just don't know cause I didn't finish the article yet.
[58:51.660 --> 58:55.380]  Like he visited him in October and the articles coming out now,
[58:55.380 --> 58:59.060]  but it seems like maybe they felt like their hand was pressed when the
[58:59.100 --> 59:03.500]  authorities took El Chapo back into custody and they wanted to publish it. But it,
[59:03.540 --> 59:08.020]  it's clearly a very light editing pass.
[59:08.740 --> 59:10.580]  It, you know, in terms of it,
[59:10.740 --> 59:14.660]  it doesn't read like your typical rolling stone feature. Uh,
[59:14.660 --> 59:17.780]  it, a lot of Sean Penn's personality is,
[59:17.820 --> 59:21.860]  is infused in the pros and I think he did a hell of a job. There's,
[59:21.900 --> 59:26.220]  there's certain touches that as a writer, like felt like,
[59:26.380 --> 59:28.260]  you know, a little over the top,
[59:28.300 --> 59:32.540]  like it's a little awkward in certain phrasing,
[59:32.580 --> 59:33.860]  but for the most part though,
[59:33.860 --> 59:37.540]  I really enjoy the visceral nature nature of the pros.
[59:37.580 --> 59:42.500]  I think it was just a tremendous read and it's just such a crazy idea.
[59:42.500 --> 59:46.460]  You know, I kind of fascinated by Sean Penn, you know,
[59:46.460 --> 59:50.580]  he just does things that other people, it just never occurs of to do. Right.
[59:50.580 --> 59:54.980]  Remember like with, uh, with the hurricane in, in new Orleans,
[59:56.300 --> 59:59.940]  what was that hurricane? What was it called? Katrina. Katrina. There's like,
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.620]  there's Sean Penn, like in a rowboat saving people, you know,
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.980]  getting them off the roofs, you know,
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.740]  like what the hell is Sean Penn doing on a rowboat in new Orleans? How did,
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.420]  how did he get there? How do you get to a flooded city if you don't live there?
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.220]  You know, it's not like he's, he just went, you know,
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:22.020]  what a crazy idea to have is I'm going to go meet the most notorious drug king
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.300]  pin in the world today and write a story about it.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.580]  Yeah. And a lot of the criticism has been that, uh,
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.060]  that El Chapo, Chapo or Chapo? Well, I guess in, in,
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.020]  in Spanish you'd say Chapo. El Chapo.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.180]  So that he was given editorial control essentially, that he was allowed to,
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.820]  um, you know, make changes or at least, uh, reject the,
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.580]  it was submitted to the agreement was, we'll, we'll submit to you, you know,
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.860]  a manuscript. And if you have objections, we will take your objections. Right.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.980]  So a lot of people are saying, and, and whatever,
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.860]  they said that he didn't make any changes or something like that.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.340]  But a lot of people are criticizing that as, uh, you know, essentially, uh,
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.580]  you know, a press release from El Chapo, uh,
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.820]  written by Sean Penn submitted to rolling stone, which is, you know,
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.620]  historically a journalistic organization and they just go and run it.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.980]  Um, I don't know. I think it's, I think it's, uh,
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.540]  that's kind of the time we're in where a lot of places are just publishing
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.460]  directly on medium and, uh, or on their websites or something like that.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.260]  If you look at Elon Musk, he does the same thing. So I don't, you know,
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.620]  I, it would be a tough call if I were the editor of rolling stone.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.420]  I think that if I were the publisher of rolling stone, I'd be very,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.900]  like very excited about this because it's certainly gotten them a lot of
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.420]  attention and probably a lot of web traffic. And, um,
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.300]  but it's interesting. Like do, what do you, do you allow that? What do you,
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.140]  here's my take? My, I, and this is really what I wanted to talk about.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.580]  It was that journalistic angle.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.700]  I don't have a problem with it because right up front,
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.020]  that's how the article starts is in italics. Like it's an editor's note.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.420]  It explains that situation entirely,
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.460]  which is that part of the deal for this entire thing before it started was an
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.420]  agreement that the article would be submitted to El Chapo's people for their
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:18.340]  approval. And it was, and they didn't make any changes. And so to me,
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.900]  that the, the,
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.620]  what makes it okay is the fact that they disclosed that in very clear language
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.940]  right up front and that they like, so the El Chapo people said,
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.260]  we want to approve the article. And I think the rolling stone people said, okay,
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:36.260]  okay, we'll do it. But we're going, we were going to explain what was approved.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:36.900]  You know,
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.660]  we're going to explain that this deal was in place and we're going to say
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.220]  whether or not you changed anything. And so to me,
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.700]  obviously that's less than ideal.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.500]  It'd be great if the El Chapo people just said,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.820]  you can write whatever you want,
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.900]  but obviously they weren't going to let that happen. And so yeah,
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.340]  the world is a better place that this article exists than if it didn't like it
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.620]  was, it's not like they had the option to do it without that arrangement. Right.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:06.820]  The fact that it was disclosed to me makes it acceptable.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.300]  Like I think the people who are objecting to it on a P like it's failing a
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.740]  certain purity test are being,
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:17.700]  a lot of them are jealous that they, I definitely think so. Yeah. I mean,
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.340]  the truth about this, there are no rules.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.780]  It's not like there's a law or something that says that, you know, every,
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.140]  every article published anywhere must be vetted by something or something like
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:31.100]  that. I mean, uh, so whatever, uh, if, if,
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:36.060]  if you're jealous that your publication did not get the scoop on El Chapo
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.740]  from Sean Penn, um, I guess that sucks, but it is interesting.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.580]  I think it's, I think it's cool. I want to read it. Uh, I saved it.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.740]  I'm going to read it. Uh, I,
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:51.980]  I like the idea of getting kind of raw writing from
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.900]  non-traditional writers. I think that's really interesting.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.100]  That to me is exactly what it feels like. And in terms of, well,
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.660]  the argument that this could just be a press release from El Chapo,
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.780]  obviously that's a risk. I mean,
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.460]  but you just read the article with an open mind and judge for yourself.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.980]  And I having read most of the article would say,
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.460]  it's definitely not the case. It doesn't whitewash over anything.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.340]  It's really just sort of a first person narrative. You are there.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.540]  This is what it's like to try to get to this guy. Um, story,
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.340]  to me, it was just a good read,
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.900]  but I think you have to keep an open mind on something like that.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.540]  And I also think that there's a certain sanctimoniousness among the
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.140]  professional journalists who like object to this on, um,
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.260]  you know, this is not the way it's done by serious publications, uh,
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:41.380]  is that those publications that have those rules, like if,
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.020]  and I'm sure a lot of them really do have it codified, you know, like, uh,
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.780]  60 minutes does not allow the sources of a show to
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.540]  to see it before it airs. Um, that's fine.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.580]  That's you know, it's fine to have rules like that.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.060]  And it certainly does protect you from, you know,
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.380]  accusations that you're, you're currying favor with your subjects or something.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.180]  But those publications, obviously they miss out on an awful lot of stuff that
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.220]  they're, that these, you know, these rules and traditions keep them from,
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.100]  from getting
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.860]  exactly. And self publishing, like you said,
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.660]  like how much stuff is going on medium these days? Um, the,
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:23.660]  the world where, you know, in the old days, they, they could,
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.260]  they could take a stance like that.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.260]  And the only people who could really get a story out were the ones who owned a
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.260]  printing press and had, um, you know,
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.380]  million or 2 million circulation newspaper or magazine. Uh,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.260]  you don't need that anymore. Right? So anybody can,
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.980]  anybody can handle two or 3 million people reading their site if they publish
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.740]  it on WordPress or medium or something like that.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.580]  Um, and so they don't, you know, they don't control the,
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:53.340]  the means of distribution anymore and they're sort of holding on, Oh,
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.540]  you know, get me to the fainting couch. They,
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.540]  they let the subject pre-approve the story. It's this, this is, you know,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.100]  I've got the vapor, somebody get the smelling salts. It's ridiculous.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:04.740]  Yeah. It's fascinating. Uh,
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.500]  Dave Weiner actually wrote a good essay about this, uh,
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.260]  making many of these same points. And I totally agree. I mean, listen,
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.100]  I went to, uh, you know, quote unquote professional journalism school. I mean,
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.140]  that's what my undergrad college was and I don't care. I think it's great that,
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.820]  uh, that, that people can sell publish now. Um, there's,
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.060]  there's certain things that I won't do because that's the job I have,
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.300]  but that's fine. I, you know,
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.660]  I think the best thing you can do is be very clear about what happened and what
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:39.300]  didn't happen. It seems like that's what they did here. So, right. I feel,
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.740]  uh, I, and I,
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:45.140]  Dave Weiner has been thinking about these things since the invention of the web
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.740]  in the nineties. And he's a really,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.740]  I think he has a really interesting perspective on this stuff.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.460]  And, um,
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.100]  I think it is to make a long story short,
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.620]  I think that institutional journalism, the capital J journalism,
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.260]  like you said,
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.500]  like going to actual journalism school and working at a, at a longstanding,
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.780]  uh, you know, traditional publication,
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.820]  they've made things more complicated than it really is. They've set up this,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.620]  this like a written and or unwritten list of rules of how it's done.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.940]  Whereas the truth of it is it lowercase J journalism that anybody can,
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.020]  can conduct is to me,
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.980]  it's fundamentally about getting the truth out there,
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.300]  whether it's true facts or whether it's like in a lot of my writing,
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.940]  truly what I believe and think my opinion,
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.180]  my honest opinion about how things are going, that's what it's all about.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:41.860]  And that's it.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.020]  And so part of the truth could be like writing a disclaimer that says the
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.260]  subject of this story had the following demands. And that's the truth.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.180]  The truth is we had this arrangement and now, you know,
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.700]  yeah, let's be, let's be honest.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:01.980]  Like the people with all the rules get stuff wrong all the time too. So exactly.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.460]  It's not like they lead to perfection.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.100]  Right. And you know, and I, I love the New York times.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.700]  New York times is one of my favorite newspapers or it is my favorite newspaper.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.980]  And it's its source that I read.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.780]  I read something in the New York times every single day. Uh, but you know,
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.620]  and they,
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.260]  they exemplify that sort of traditional journalism and they've had some
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.140]  absolutely terrible things in the last few decades, you know,
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.820]  with the Judy Miller, uh, her reporting on the lead up to the Iraq war.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.900]  And, uh, who was the guy that had the serial fabulous,
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:36.580]  fabulous, Jason, uh, Hmm. Well,
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.900]  whatever his name was, Jason, uh, you know, Jason Bourne. No,
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:46.380]  uh, he was a J A Y S O N too. Oh, right. Uh, Jason Blair. Yeah.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:50.460]  Jason Blair. So they had a reporter on the staff who, it turns out, had, uh,
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.620]  serially fabricated news reports. Uh,
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.860]  uh, you know, again,
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.260]  those rules are not a protection against things like that going wrong.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.740]  And fundamentally in both of those cases, the problem is that it wasn't,
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.500]  the truth that was coming out, you know,
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.180]  what Judy Miller was reporting from her sources in Iraq was not the truth.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:14.060]  And that led to disasters, you know, circumstances and the Jason Blair stuff.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.540]  It didn't really lead to any kind of disaster like the Iraq war,
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.420]  but the whole problem is that it greatly diluted the credibility
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.820]  of if it's printed in the New York times, it's true.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:28.220]  True. And then all those David Pogue reviews.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:35.100]  I miss Pogue. Well, he's, I don't see his stuff anymore.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.260]  I was just talking to somebody about that, uh,
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.220]  that I know he's still doing this thing at Yahoo. Uh,
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.820]  I just saw him recently too. Oh, I saw him in New York when I was getting the,
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:50.820]  uh, my iPad pro review unit. He must've been cool.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.180]  He must've been like right before me. Um, but I saw,
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.580]  I was going into a hotel while he was coming out. Um, so he's, you know,
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.820]  he still does, but I don't know why. I don't know what it is.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.140]  There's some kind of, you know,
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:06.180]  like tech meme search optimization
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.500]  strategy that the Yahoo people aren't doing. Cause I don't see his stuff.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.660]  I don't know what, I don't know why that is. Yeah. I don't know.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.980]  Like now that Mossberg is, you know,
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.940]  not at the journal and is writing for recode and diverge and stuff.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.780]  I still see Mossberg reviews, you know, like they,
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.660]  they percolate into my peripheral vision and it's like, Oh, open that in a tab.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.300]  Whereas pogues don't, I somehow wind up not without any David pogues tabs.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:36.500]  Yeah. Same. Maybe it just needs to tweet more. Yeah, maybe.
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.060]  I don't know. Uh, let's take one last break here.
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.980]  And I'll thank our third and final sponsor of the day.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:47.560]  And it's our good friends at igloo. Now you guys know what an intranet is.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.980]  Intranet is a thing that your company has for internal communication that nobody
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:56.980]  ever looks at or updates igloo is an intranet you will actually like because it
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.180]  doesn't look like it was designed in the late nineties because it wasn't,
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.020]  it's really just been designed in the last few years and it is entirely designed
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.460]  around the modern concepts of how the web should work. Everything,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.780]  it works on all devices. It scales from your phone to your tablets to desktop,
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:19.140]  uh, and it has features that are modern things like a micro block.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.780]  So you could have for your internal team,
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.900]  a little Twitter like thing that's private on your internet and you can do the
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.340]  links and texts and stuff like that. Um,
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.700]  but it's entirely private and it's hosted and you can access it anywhere from
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:35.260]  your phone, from the road, anything like that.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.940]  All sorts of great features. You can have, uh, to do's,
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.100]  you can manage the to do's calendars, uh,
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.380]  so many features and all the features you would want for internal communication
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.500]  on an intranet. They've got it.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.300]  So where do you go to find out more and get started with a free trial?
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:56.340]  Go to igloo software.com slash T T S the initials of the show igloo software.com
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.140]  slash T T S and you'll get a free trial. Go check them out.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.820]  If you have any kind of team that needs an internet.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.260]  Uh, what else is on the list?
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.460]  I just want to say that's something I think of a lot is like how,
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.100]  how to get your stuff noticed. Um, it's really interesting.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:22.660]  It's almost hard to predict who's going to read your stuff and it's almost, uh,
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.300]  it really,
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.420]  it doesn't seem to be correlated with how much traffic your site gets even or
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.460]  anything like that. Um, it's,
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.820]  it's almost a different kind of science and I don't know,
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.820]  I don't know if there's a way to crack it, but it's something that fascinates me,
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.300]  because sometimes a lot of put a lot of effort into an article and it just
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.380]  won't, it just won't get read or the other way around. Like, you know,
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:49.500]  something that, that surprisingly does really well. And sometimes it's,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.660]  you know, you get lucky with a headline or a link here or there, but, um,
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.180]  it really is weird how the web,
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.380]  how the web works with sharing and just getting read and who's reading it and
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.220]  sharing it.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:06.220]  I, I have found that, and I don't know quite why it would be,
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.940]  but to me in my career, in the time I've been writing during fireball,
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:17.700]  one of the apical moments was, you know, it's like,
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.820]  like a meteor that changed the, you know,
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:23.900]  hit and change the world forever was when Google shuttered, uh,
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.860]  Google reader, Google reader, uh,
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.140]  shuttering instantly cut into the traffic that during fireball gets.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.260]  So if I measure, I don't think it cut people.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.300]  I honestly don't truly believe that the number of people who read my writing on
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.620]  a regular basis, if anything, continued to slowly grow.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.380]  But in terms of like page views,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.460]  it was instantaneous and permanent and the number of pages I get per month is
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.220]  way fewer than from before.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:56.020]  And it correlates to exactly to where Google pulled the plug on Google reader.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.940]  And I think my, my, my guess is that,
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.340]  uh, a lot of,
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.780]  awful lot of people who read during fireball used Google reader and they
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.580]  subscribed to my site and whenever something new came up,
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.980]  they would go to, you know,
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.300]  click the thing that would go to my website and I would register, you know,
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:20.220]  my analytics and whatever would register as a, as a hit. And anyway,
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.900]  long story short, I don't get the traffic I used to in terms of page views.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:27.340]  I've never been happier that I don't have page view tied advertising,
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.020]  uh, because that would have been, it really would have hit.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.660]  It absolutely would have hurt if I,
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.820]  if the advertising on during fireball was correlated to page views.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.260]  And I think it's just that people now more,
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.860]  a lot of people check it when it comes to mind instead of checking as soon as,
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.060]  you know, getting, you know,
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.540]  treating Google reader as like a notification system of, Oh,
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.620]  Gruber posted something, I'll go check it out. Um, and, uh,
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.300]  well the other thing, and this is where I'm getting at, is that pre Google reader,
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.220]  I was very,
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.860]  very good at guessing which longer pieces I wrote were going to have legs and
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:02.780]  which ones weren't. And now I don't, I, I'm often, I often think, wow,
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.460]  I think I hit a home run with this one and it doesn't really like the next day,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.380]  my nothing is, you know, there's no, there's no bump.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.580]  And then like last month I wrote,
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:16.420]  I spent an awful lot of time really examining that the battery case,
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.300]  you know, like, uh, an awful,
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.420]  I remember an awful lot of the feedback I got was why in the world would you
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.540]  spend that much time on the battery case? And the explanation is I,
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.820]  it's because I could write about it. I've, I found it interesting.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.740]  I think there were some very interesting things about it.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.180]  And because it's such a simple little thing, you can fully consider it.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:39.540]  There's, you know, you can explore every little alley and crevice and,
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.180]  and notion about it. But it,
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.700]  it was one of the most popular things I've written in months. I think it,
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.260]  I think it was more popular than like my iPhone success review.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.100]  Yeah.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.700]  If I just measure by, by page views and seemingly how many new people did it.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.340]  And I wasn't even the first to write the article,
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.660]  but somehow that one really took off and I, I, I'm,
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.420]  I no longer can predict which ones are going to be popular or not.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:04.460]  Uh, speaking of that article, I mean, I still can't believe how,
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:08.300]  how controversial that, uh, battery case was. That was,
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.660]  well, I guess that's, I think that that's why the article was popular.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.100]  I think that there really are people really have strong feelings about this.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.380]  I mean, you also went very deep on it.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.740]  Yeah. I think what it is too,
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.820]  is that there's an awful lot of people who viscerally hate this design.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:27.740]  They really do. I mean, they are, it, it is like,
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.100]  you know, like bringing up Obama or something, you know, with your, your,
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.260]  you know, your crazy uncle who's a Donald Trump supporter, you know, it like,
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.620]  it like turns on like a red anger bulb in people's heads.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.820]  And there are some people cannot even talk about it in a, you know,
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.180]  you know, you would, you would think that an argument, a little debate,
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:48.860]  if you will,
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:53.180]  over the design of a phone battery pack would be the sort of thing that would
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.620]  not make anybody angry, but you would be wrong.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.660]  And so the people who dislike it really, really dislike it. And it, it, it,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.100]  it seemsingly, it seems to offend them on an emotional level.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.620]  And on the other side,
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:10.660]  I think what maybe made my article popular is that the people who either are
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.500]  intrigued by it or actually like it, they can't articulate what,
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.060]  why it's, it's again, almost like at an emotional level, they're like, Oh,
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:22.820]  I don't know. It doesn't look bad to me. Um, but they are, uh, they,
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:27.340]  I think that they've largely been quiet in public because if you try to take
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.180]  that position,
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:33.460]  anything other than this design is an abject failure and maybe Johnny I've is,
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.900]  you know, we ought to investigate whether he's losing his mind. Um,
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.700]  if you take any position short of that,
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.660]  the people who hate it will jump all over you.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:44.260]  And most people don't want to be jumped all over me. I don't care.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.180]  Uh, the only way to, you know, it reminds me of,
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.140]  have you ever seen the Boeing dream lifter? Oh, I think so. Yeah.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:58.300]  Just like the, uh, the 747 that they just added a bubble on top of, uh,
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:02.860]  to make it a big enough so they could carry the fuselage of another of the
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.260]  dreamliner. Yeah. Yeah. It's literally like just putting a bump on the, uh,
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.540]  you know, around, around the 747. Um,
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.900]  yeah, I think it's funny. Uh,
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:19.460]  it reminds me a lot of when a new logo comes out and everyone just jumps on it
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.860]  the first day, you know, this is horrible. I can't believe it.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.300]  And then no one cares after that. Um, I think, you know,
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.340]  and so much of the design of that thing is how it works and I
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:37.260]  haven't used it. I have a six S plus, so I don't need a battery pack, but, um,
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.740]  brag, but, uh, actually I did need a battery pack at CES.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.220]  Oh, that's interesting. Even with the plus. Yeah.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:49.020]  Cause the cell signal is so bad there that I'm sure you're using way more
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.220]  battery than you should be. And, uh, even when, even,
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.980]  I've never been in CS, obviously, you know, or repeated again,
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.900]  but I've been to Vegas many times and Vegas has notoriously bad, in my opinion,
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.540]  cellular coverage. And in addition to the fact that the cellular coverage,
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.380]  isn't that great in general,
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.620]  that's just talking like if you're outside or near a door,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.260]  but the buildings are these caverns and they're, you know,
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.620]  the Faraday cage aspect of, you know, what it's like when you're covered by,
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.340]  you know, three tons of concrete and who even knows whether, you know,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.780]  if you're underground or above ground or where the hell you are, you know, it could,
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.500]  it could definitely be a challenge.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.140]  Yeah. I got one of those anchor packs. That's supposedly, you know,
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:32.780]  big enough to charge a Mac book and an iPad and a phone and all kinds of stuff.
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.020]  So, uh, so I did use that, but, uh, anyway, I don't remember where I was,
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.300]  but it's, you know, if, if you need a battery pack,
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.740]  it seems like it actually works pretty well, which is the whole point. So I don't,
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.140]  I don't know, whatever I, I re I thought you went deliciously over the top on
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.580]  that post, but as you say,
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.380]  like it's a small enough thing where you can really examine it from
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:59.540]  every angle. And why not? Like, that's the whole point of being a self publisher
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.060]  on the web is you could do something ridiculous like that.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.380]  I, the other thing I'm, I'm thinking about, and I've,
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:09.060]  I went and bought a bunch of them. Um, but I've always been,
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.100]  and I even said it there on bottom of my article, my,
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:15.980]  my solution to battery challenge days is to have a little external battery
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.580]  pack, but I like the little ones.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.540]  I like ones that I can put in my other pocket and it's almost like I don't even
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:24.460]  notice that it's there. Um, and Mophie makes a bunch of them,
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.340]  but I honestly consider it to be a shortcoming in their company in that they
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.540]  make too many of them. And that one of the things I really,
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.620]  really appreciated about Apple is that if you're going to buy an Apple blank and
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:40.060]  insert any product there, you can go and decide which one to get. And it's, uh,
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.940]  it's, I'm an indecisive person and I will pause it,
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.620]  but I never have a problem figuring out which Mac book to buy. I,
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:51.100]  and even now at a moment when their lineup is in flux and they still have the
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.740]  old Mac book airs and the new Mac book one,
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.820]  which is underpowered and the Mac book, I know which, which Mac I want.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.140]  I want a third. I want the 13 inch Mac book pro. That's the best.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.740]  That's the one I want. Uh, I find it so hard to figure out,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.420]  go to mophie.com and figure out which battery pack to buy because they not only
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:10.380]  have different sizes in terms of like, well,
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.220]  here's the small one that'll refill one iPhone from, you know,
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:17.500]  uh, throughout the day or here's a really big one that you could use to charge
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.780]  an iPad and two phones or something like that. Um,
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.700]  but they also have multiple designs.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.900]  They have ones with built in cables, not with built in cables, ones, you know,
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:30.940]  the, it's too much. They should be the ones who, they're the battery experts.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:34.740]  They should design the right design and then I don't have to worry about it.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.940]  It's almost like when you go to mophie.com and pick a battery pack, uh,
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:44.620]  or the bat, you know, external battery pack, you almost have to design it yourself.
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.900]  Cause you've got to figure out, do you want an integrated cables?
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.620]  Do you want to have separate cables? Do you care that it's,
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.780]  that the battery is going to charge by micro USB,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.820]  but the phone is going to charge by lightning.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.260]  So you have to bring two different things at night.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.580]  Does it do pass through charging?
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:04.020]  Meaning that at the end of the day when you put up next to your hotel bed,
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.660]  do you have one thing to plug in and it'll, you know, the battery will plug,
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:09.860]  do you fill your phone first and then fill itself up?
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:13.420]  Or do you have to plug two different things in because the battery pack won't
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.540]  charge the phone while it itself is being charged there.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.060]  They have all of those options are there for you to consider from just one
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:23.460]  company. And I kind of, I find it maddening.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.980]  So I feel like I want to write an article and figure out which,
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.100]  which is the best one and effectively design it for mophie.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:34.300]  This is your version of Marco's headphone test. Yes, exactly. It's exactly it.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.900]  It's my version of Marco's headphone test is battery packs, except that I'm only
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.500]  going to do mophies. And speaking of Marco,
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.020]  Marco recommended one to me personally. Uh,
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.260]  can't find it here. The other one to check out is anchor and K E R,
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.500]  which are some ex Google people who make, um,
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:56.340]  very nice battery and charging stuff. They're like,
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.340]  they're the ones who I also have a four port USB charger, which I care,
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:04.740]  which I travel with now so I can, don't have to bring any of the apple charging
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:08.740]  bricks. I just bring this and plug in my Mac book,
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.300]  iPhone, Apple watch, and, um,
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.540]  can charge something else at the same time. All right.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.620]  I'll take a look at the anchor ones, but anyway, Marco recommended one to me.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.300]  He bought at, at Amazon for 24 bucks. Um,
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.260]  and it has built in cables and I'm, I'm a built in cable fan. So you don't,
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.940]  you know, it's just one thing to put in your pocket.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.060]  And the son of a bitch and thing broke. I didn't,
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.700]  I hadn't even gotten past the point where I was just testing how, you know,
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:37.420]  like how, how quickly and you know,
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.060]  just testing a whole bunch of different,
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.820]  these battery packs on my phone every time I'd let my phone go down.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.020]  I'd only used it like three times and I'd never even taken it out of the house.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.860]  So it wasn't like it, it, you know, it was dropped or anything like that.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.940]  It just, the lightning poured on, it just stopped working.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.340]  So I think there's a sort of, you get what you pay for aspect in there.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.980]  And I also found it curious that Marco of all people was the one who recommended
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:02.300]  this cheap one to me. Hmm. Yeah.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.940]  Maybe an imposter. I don't remember.
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.580]  I don't remember the name of the company. It was weird. Oh, here it is.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.700]  It's underneath the pile of shit on my desk. Uh,
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.940]  I hate to throw the company under the bus, but it's a volt ready view.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:18.020]  L T R E a D Y.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.020]  And if you go to Amazon and look at the vault ready,
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.100]  you'll see what I mean about these integrated cables.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:24.980]  And they're super, super thin. The cables. I mean, it's,
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.660]  it's so much thinner than the lightning port itself. And I, you know, it don't,
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.100]  I think that's probably why it broke.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.100]  I think you need like a good, thick cable.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.580]  Have you installed, uh, iOS 9.3 yet? No, I have not.
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.540]  I haven't either. I'm not, uh, I'm not in the beta cycle.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.860]  What's what's different about it.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.460]  Uh, the, the, the like fake, uh,
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.460]  the Sherlock flux or whatever that thing is called F flux.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:58.980]  So you can get the, uh, warmer colors at nighttime.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:03.260]  So it's easier on your eyes when you're about to go to sleep. Interesting.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.580]  And, um, there were all those new features for education,
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:11.100]  like the multiple user mode and that kind of stuff,
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.580]  which you assume is going to be part of, uh,
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:06.860]  the
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:11.140]  iOS 10. So everyone can sell, but it's still, it's still just in beta, right?
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.860]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I thought maybe I really out to lunch. No,
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.460]  I'm kind of done. I, I,
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:21.140]  I do the betas of the major new OS over the summer,
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.900]  but that's mainly because I know, you know, my phone's a year old.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.700]  I'm getting a little bit of a headache. I'm getting a little bit of a headache.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.500]  I'm getting a little bit of a headache. I'm getting a little bit of a headache.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.260]  So, uh,
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.780]  I'm getting a little bit of a headache. So I'm getting a little bit of a headache.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.660]  I know, you know, my phone's a year old, I'm getting a new phone anyway.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.380]  So if it goes belly up and it's usually there's like major, major features,
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.300]  I want to get, get ahold of them. But for stuff like the minor ones,
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:48.340]  I usually don't do the betas. Yeah. Same. Have you, uh,
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:54.460]  uh, have you been using the Apple TV a lot? Uh, every day, every day.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:58.900]  Have you used the game controller yet? Yeah, I have the game controller. Uh,
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.860]  I don't use it very frequently cause I just, I just don't play video games. Um,
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.420]  um, yeah, I bought one to,
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:10.700]  to hopefully play games on and I used it the first day I had it and then I
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.940]  haven't used it since then. Yeah. But that's really just me.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.100]  It's not like that I couldn't find some games I liked.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.700]  I found a couple of games I really liked, but, uh,
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.420]  it just never occurs to me to play video games. Yeah, me neither.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.580]  I thought I would though. I thought so too.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:30.820]  I think of all the things like if I time traveled back and talked to my like
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.700]  10, 11, 12 year old self,
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.940]  I think that I would have lots of good news to tell young John Gruber.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:38.140]  And I think he would be very happy about his future.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.860]  But I think of all the things he'd be most surprised by is that I would tell
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:43.580]  him that I, you,
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:47.260]  you're going to grow up and have the financial ability, uh,
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.340]  and the flexibility in your daily schedule to own and play any video game you
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:57.020]  want for as long as you want, practically speaking. And you're not going to.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:57.860]  Yeah.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.420]  Yeah. I think that pretty much,
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:07.580]  I think that my like 12 year old self would instantly suspect that whoever this
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.460]  guy who does kind of look like me, uh,
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.500]  and it was credibly well cast to play the person who's going to prank me and
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.300]  tell me that it's me when I'm 42, uh,
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:24.580]  is obviously full of shit because there's no chance that if I could spend four
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.660]  to five hours every night playing cool video games that I wouldn't be doing it.
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:32.820]  I downloaded one, uh, for the Apple watch, which, you know,
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.940]  that was another one of those things where they were like, Oh,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:38.100]  watch OS two is going to be, uh, you know,
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.580]  it's going to be really helpful for games because they'll be able to run
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:45.580]  directly on the watch and also be able to use the digital crown as a controlling
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:50.060]  mechanism. And, um, no, not fun.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.580]  One of the games was like a,
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:55.980]  almost like a card game type thing and it was just too, too weird.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:00.540]  And the other one was like pong type thing and it was just so jerky that I saw
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:05.220]  that I kept losing because I either got the same one or I downloaded a similar
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.220]  one and I think maybe there might be a month,
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.020]  a bunch because if all you have is the crown,
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:13.860]  pong is a very obvious concept and it was terrible.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:18.820]  It was absolutely terrible. Yeah, I did not enjoy that. As, as,
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:23.380]  as we head into the new Apple watch season and I suspect that they're going to
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.620]  announce it early this year. Um, you know,
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:29.380]  at this event that they're supposedly having in March, um,
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.460]  I do think we'll get a new watch. Uh, and as we, you know,
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.380]  what do we think of Apple watch? I have to write this piece.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.180]  I do cause I have a lot of thoughts on it. Um, but bottom line, I think,
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:43.380]  I think it's very clear in hindsight that they should not have had any apps at
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:47.900]  all for the first Apple watch. I mean maybe eventually it'll be adapt platform,
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.460]  but it's clearly not ready for it yet.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:54.700]  And slow apps is way worse than no apps in my opinion.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:59.380]  And to me even now, even, you know, with watchos two and everything,
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:04.660]  it's also still incredibly inconsistent where if I go to like a weather app on
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.140]  the watch,
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.700]  sometimes it'll just spin and spin and spin until the screen goes off.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.580]  And if I go to the exact same app like dark sky or something and take my phone
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:19.100]  out of my pocket and go to dark sky, it works instantly and has all, you know,
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.900]  all the data I want, you know,
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.060]  the information about the weather that I was looking for. And so what,
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:27.420]  it doesn't take long to be psychologically conditioned to,
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.780]  because you don't trust that it's even going to work at all on the watch.
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:34.940]  It doesn't take you very long at all that you just instinctively go for the app
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:35.820]  on your phone.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.940]  Totally. Especially with, uh, the,
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.980]  this S success phones being so fast and also the 3d touch shortcuts,
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:48.860]  like it's now, you know, when the watch launched,
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.660]  to me it was really helpful to be able to quickly access something without
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.380]  reaching in my pocket and taking out this giant phone. Um,
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.820]  but now the phone is so fast that, and the touch ID, uh,
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:04.340]  unlock is so fast that it actually is faster now again,
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:08.420]  to take my phone out then to try to get anything done on the watch.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:11.740]  Right. It's just, it's just, and that doesn't mean that the, you know,
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.380]  that the watch as a whole is a failure,
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.380]  but I feel like what this first watch was good and interesting for is just the
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.540]  ambient stuff, you know, the tracking, the health, you know,
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:25.740]  tracking your stuff, doing the workouts and whatever you can figure to be shown
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:29.700]  at a glance on your, you know, without even doing anything is,
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:32.340]  you know, and that's enough, that's enough to make it a product.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.180]  I think that the idea that they had to make,
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.900]  you had to have apps and their first one was wrong.
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:41.420]  And I think it's kind of funny because they famously had no apps on the first
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:45.420]  iPhone and it turns out that the phone was absolutely, you know,
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:50.460]  probably the best platform for quote unquote apps that mankind has ever created.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.660]  It's like the pinnacle of apps as the central premise of how you're going to use
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:57.380]  a device. Um, didn't even have it at first.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.500]  So if the, if the phone could get away without it at first,
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.700]  I don't see why the watch couldn't have. And I think in hindsight,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.340]  the watch should have, yeah, I wrote kind of a,
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:09.740]  whatever it was like seven month review, uh, about a month ago now.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.020]  And that was, you know, similar. I mean,
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.820]  my high level conclusion was I still use it every day and I still really like it
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.180]  a lot, but I haven't,
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.860]  I'm not using it for any new things than I was at the beginning. Um,
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.140]  I'm still basically using it for the same things as I did when I started.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:25.780]  So in that way,
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:30.020]  it felt stalled in the sense that we were promised this kind of unlimited
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.220]  platform and no one's really taking advantage of it. Um,
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.900]  whereas in reality, like I'm very happy with the things that it does well,
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:41.260]  the fitness tracking, the, um, you know, so again,
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:45.060]  I'm always surprised how useful it is to have the time in front of me, uh,
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:49.220]  especially with my phone now being so unwieldy, uh,
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:54.220]  and, um, you know, and, and a few very other basic things. So I'm sure that
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.180]  I've enjoyed that from other people too.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:00.780]  I know Marco was saying on his podcast either the last episode or the last one I
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.860]  listened to where he's like for Christmas,
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:05.660]  got a mechanical watch because he's, you know,
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:08.300]  he's, you know, he never wore a watch in his entire life,
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.780]  but just the convenience of having the time on your wrist.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:14.420]  It turns out that's actually pretty cool. Yeah. All of us like me,
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.260]  we've been wearing watches my whole life. It's like, come on, we've,
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:21.180]  why did you have to be told this? I know. I had a, you know, I had,
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.540]  I was the kid with the nerd watch in school with the calculator,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:28.180]  Cassie or whatever, but I forgot, I forgot all about that. Honestly,
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.620]  like the temperature is cool to have. Yeah.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:34.580]  That's the one thing when I wear my, my traditional watch, my regular watch, uh,
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:39.580]  the one thing that I miss every single day is that I expect to be able to look
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.900]  at my wrist and see what the temperature is outside. Yeah. And every time it,
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:48.100]  it's always, it's, I mean, it's, it's,
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.740]  it's uncanny how I could go days without wearing my Apple watch and I still,
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.300]  as I'm heading out the door and deciding which coat to put on,
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.940]  I look at my wrist and I'm like, Oh, it's not going to help. Yeah. Are you, uh,
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.500]  are you Apple paying with it? Yeah, I do. When I have it on, I Apple pay.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.820]  And that's another thing too is cause, uh,
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:10.500]  the supermarket where we go is a whole foods and they take Apple pay and I
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.140]  instantly, every single time I,
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.260]  whether I'm wearing my Apple watch or not Apple watch, I,
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:19.460]  I put my wrist up to the kiosk. Nice.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:25.420]  Uh, yeah, I do. I mean, I almost every day I do that. So it is,
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:29.300]  I find in, I thought, so I thought it would be true back in may when I first
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.860]  got it and it turns out it's very true.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:35.860]  It is terrific in the East coast winter to have an Apple pay thing that you
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:39.900]  don't have to fish out of your pocket when you're wearing a coat and layers of
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.900]  clothing and stuff, gloves too. Right.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:44.300]  And actually you can go straight through the sleeve.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:47.980]  You don't even need to roll up your sleeve.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.020]  You just double click on that button and the NFC will go right through your
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:56.100]  shirt. Yeah, it is interesting. I'll tell you one thing too,
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:01.100]  is I never use the single click on that contact thing to contact people only by
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:05.340]  accident. Right. And so I really feel like in hindsight,
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.300]  they got that wrong.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.700]  Like single click should have an Apple pay and double click should have been
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.380]  jumped to context shortcuts,
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.100]  at least for me personally because when I do want to contact somebody,
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:18.620]  like if I want to text my son, I'll do it via Siri.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.260]  I'll, I'll long press the other thing and just say text Jonas,
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.660]  whatever it is I want to text him.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.980]  Cause you have to dictate the text anyway.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.700]  So why not just initiate the contact from the voice too?
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.300]  It seems,
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:37.900]  I assume they probably thought people would be doing the drawings and the touch
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.140]  stuff more than they do. Like I haven't done that stuff in months. No.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:46.300]  Only when somebody gets a new Apple watch. Yeah. Right. In hindsight,
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.700]  it's just one of those things where, and I kind of, it makes me a little worried,
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:52.220]  you know, it's a worrisome product in some ways about Apple.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.100]  Cause it makes me wonder what, what made them think while they were using it
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.740]  themselves, that this would be useful.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:02.820]  Like it just seems to me that if they spent as much time thinking about it as I
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.540]  have in the first six months while I wore it,
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:09.260]  why didn't they come to the same conclusions I did? Like, I mean,
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.260]  that's a good, the whole idea. It was a great idea. I was very intrigued by it.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.300]  You know, the,
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:18.260]  the idea that you would have these favorite people and one touch away from just
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.340]  sending, you know, your heartbeat or whatever fabulous idea.
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.580]  But then I feel like once you actually have it on your wrist and you can do it,
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.220]  it turns out it doesn't, it doesn't really stick.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.220]  I think that it's going to be some of the most interesting things are going to
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:36.220]  be what they change based on what they've now learned from, you know,
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.660]  millions of people using this thing. Um,
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:40.940]  and that's the software as well as the hardware.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.780]  I think we've already seen they realizing that, uh,
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:49.340]  the sport is kind of the, is the main watch. So, yeah. Um,
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.180]  there's more colors now. We'll see what else changes with that,
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.980]  but the software changes. Yeah. I know what you said. It was like the best one.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.180]  Yeah. I think it's the best one.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:59.620]  And I think all of the worrying that people did,
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.740]  I think this is to me one of the most interesting things about it is all the
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:03.780]  worrying people did that,
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.620]  that the common person is going to get short changed and gets this cruddy
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.780]  aluminum one. And people,
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.980]  it's only rich people who can afford a thousand dollar stainless steel one who
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:14.980]  are going to get the nice one. It's actually the other way around.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.980]  The people who bought the $400 sport one got the best watch.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:22.540]  I really do believe that. Yeah. I love mine. And so I,
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.500]  I'm just super curious to see what, uh, what they change.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:31.860]  Software wise too. Yeah. Yeah, I am too. I'm I've, and I don't,
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:36.620]  one of the, the software group has really gotten good at keeping a lid, you know,
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:39.060]  not much leaks out of Apple software these days.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.900]  So I think we're in for a surprise. I don't think that, you know, who knows?
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.740]  I mean, you never know what Mark Gurman is going to figure out, but yeah. Uh,
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.460]  uh, I don't know. I think there's a good chance that we'll be surprised.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.540]  So any guesses we have are actually real guesses. I, if I,
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.740]  you asked me right now, what do I think they're going to do?
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:00.740]  I'm going to guess a lot of health and sensor related improvements.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:06.140]  And this one might be more of a me just wishful thinking, but I really,
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:11.140]  really, really would like to see them do something a lot smarter with where the
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:15.140]  aggregate health data is, you know,
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:20.940]  making health center more of a here's everything that we know about you type
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.180]  thing. Like to me,
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:27.180]  it's way too separated with the activities is just for the watch stuff and not
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:31.580]  you and you know what I mean? Right. And you know,
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.180]  I have six months or, well,
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.180]  I have eight months of aggregated fitness tracking. Like, okay,
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.180]  what, what higher level trends can you tell me? Um, you know, uh,
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.340]  okay. When you, I don't know, when you work out on the weekend,
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:50.340]  you do something better during the week. I don't, I don't know.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:54.740]  Just like give me some more other than that page of all the rings,
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.340]  which is kind of cool, but was cool. You know,
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:01.180]  the first couple of times I looked at it and it is nice to be able to go back
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:06.180]  and kind of brag about the day I walked 27,000 step steps at CES,
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:11.180]  but it would be great to actually get some more useful information out of that
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:12.740]  page. Yeah. I think that if there's,
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:17.740]  if they're paying attention to how people seem to be using the watch in the real
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:20.180]  world, it's going to be a lot more about quantifying, you know,
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:22.180]  and helping you make sense and organize your,
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:24.180]  the data that the watch knows. And like, I mean,
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.180]  the other thing too is if I'm not wearing my watch, but I have my,
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.180]  my phone with me, the, the minimal compared to the watch,
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:34.180]  but the minimal tracking that the phone does should be easily combined with the
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:38.180]  watch, you know, to create an overall picture of like my activity and stuff like
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:42.180]  that and where I've been. Um, and then the other thing I think,
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:46.180]  I hope that they're working on is I think that they should really work to make
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.180]  it smarter about whether it's watch faces or the glances or,
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.180]  or locate, you know,
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.180]  but something so that it's just smarter about showing you what you want to be
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.180]  looking at when you look at your wrist. Yeah.
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.180]  There's plenty of context that knows about, you know, where I'm at,
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.180]  what I'm doing, that it could,
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:10.180]  I would even trust it to shuffle the complications for me somehow. Yeah.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.180]  Uh, based on the context, you know, if I'm at the airport,
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.180]  show me the travel complications. If it's nighttime, show me, you know,
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.180]  certain things. Um, and I,
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.180]  I know that it would be kind of obnoxious to have to program the logic behind
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.180]  that. So maybe you wouldn't be able to program it, but to me,
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:32.180]  that would be, there's so much more context that, uh,
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:35.180]  that they could be integrating into a lot of the decisions about what they
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.180]  show you.
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.180]  Were there a lot of, um,
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.180]  Android watches at the CES?
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.180]  Not in a really noticeable way. Um,
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:48.180]  I mean, last year it was so the,
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.180]  the whole watch thing was very novel. And of course there was the famous
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:56.180]  Apple watch knockoff and yeah, a lot of the booths, I guess,
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.180]  had kind of Android watches,
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:02.180]  but I think that, uh, it didn't really,
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:05.180]  it wasn't like a huge thing. I mean, like Samsung had one,
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.180]  but I think their only major change was just the color. Yeah. Uh,
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.180]  and then there was that, uh, Fitbit. Yeah.
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:16.180]  And it looks a little like an Apple watch, but like a hex hexagonal.
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:20.180]  That's like the corners. Yeah. I kind of dumped on it. I looked at it.
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.180]  It's fine. I mean, whatever. If you're,
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:25.180]  if you're trying to buy a $200 thing or whatever, it's, uh,
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:28.180]  and you want a Fitbit that also does a couple other things.
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:30.180]  The advantage that Fitbit has is they,
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:33.180]  they can get away with an ugly-ish design. And quite frankly,
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:37.180]  I think that their thing is ugly. It's certainly uglier than the Apple watch.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.180]  And they can get away with it because people,
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.180]  their audience is primarily looking at fitness tracking.
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:46.180]  And so if you're the thing you're most interested in is fitness tracking, uh,
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:51.180]  therefore less than great aesthetics can, you can get away with it.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:56.180]  Whereas Apple watch it's primary thing is it's supposed to be a good looking
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.180]  watch. Yeah.
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:01.180]  And I think the whole point behind this is that they want to become a more
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:05.180]  universal device and get away from, you know,
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:10.180]  the biggest risk to Fitbit is that fitness tracking becomes an app on a
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:15.180]  more universal device as opposed to a separate, uh, you know,
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:17.180]  thing that you carry around, uh, the,
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:22.180]  the way that calculator is now an app on a, on a phone or a flashlight,
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:25.180]  you know, no one's carrying a little mag light around anymore.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:29.180]  So it's your, your camera flash. So, uh, you know,
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:34.180]  I could see why they would want to kind of go after that more mainstream
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.180]  universal, more useful market,
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:41.180]  but I just don't know if they're the company that has the software and the
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.180]  ecosystem that they can get enough people using it. I mean, there's still,
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:48.180]  there's, there's selling a lot. People are buying a lot of Fitbits there.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:53.180]  The brand has a awareness and people like it, but I don't know.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:56.180]  I think they're doomed because I think that they're not going to be able to
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:42:00.180]  stay far enough ahead to, to,
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:04.180]  to stay ahead of the eventual good enough fitness tracking that's built into
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.180]  other devices, you know, including,
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:11.180]  I think right before, right after they went public,
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:15.180]  I did kind of a trolley post where I said Fitbits longterm, uh,
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:17.180]  stock chart revealed or something like that. And it was,
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:21.180]  or the longterm sales chart reveal. And it was, it was the, the,
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.180]  the shipments curve of the iPod. It was like, you know, this,
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:29.180]  this is a single purpose device that has basically become an app on a more
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:31.180]  general purpose device.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:36.180]  Over the holidays, we were at, uh, Amy's mom's house, um, for something,
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:38.180]  I don't know, some, at some point during the Christmas,
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.180]  I think it must've been Christmas. And, uh,
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:45.180]  and her mom had a, uh, LED mag light,
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:50.180]  and I was just blown away by how awesomely powerful the,
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:54.180]  the flashlight is. All the flashlights we have,
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:55.180]  and we have a bunch of them from mag light.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:58.180]  I've always been a fan of their stuff cause it's so well made,
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.180]  but ours are all the old incandescent thing. And I was like, wow,
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:05.180]  it's like I have somehow missed this revolution and I need to upgrade all our
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:08.180]  flashlights. So I went flashlight shopping for myself.
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:12.180]  And it's so funny how it's like mag light has all this,
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:16.180]  so many slogans on a bunch of their smaller ones or it's like, you know, yes,
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.180]  you really do need a flashlight. Yes, you can,
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.180]  you can have a flashlight that's so much better than the one on your phone.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.180]  And it's like, if you're telling people that they,
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.180]  if you're just reminding them that they still need to buy a flashlight, you're,
[01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.180]  you're in trouble. Like it is exactly,
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:33.180]  it mirrors exactly what the consumer camera company started saying, you know,
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.180]  five or six years ago about, yeah,
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.180]  you totally need a $200 point and shoot camera. And it's like, no,
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:42.180]  you don't go to any tourist location in the world and look at what people are
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:44.180]  using. They're all using their phones.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:51.180]  Totally. And the flashlight is right there. It's like, you know, who knew?
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:54.180]  It's like to me, it's like something I would have never predicted. I mean,
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:57.180]  and Apple obviously didn't predict it cause they were a little late to the game
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:00.180]  at making it something that you didn't need an app for.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:04.180]  But I use my iPhone as a flashlight probably at least once a day, every day,
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:09.180]  every day. Yeah. It's, it's crazy to me, but it's awesome.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:12.180]  Right. But it's, you know, it, to me in the same way,
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.180]  I'm not saying mag lights going out of business, but they're, they're,
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.180]  they're going to go,
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:19.180]  their business that was selling little $10 ones that you keep at your desk is
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:22.180]  gone. That's and it's never going to come back.
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.180]  The only lights flashlights are going to sell are the,
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:27.180]  the big serious ones that you need, you know, where you really do want like a,
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.180]  you know, a two, two D cell flashlight.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:35.180]  Yeah. And that, I mean, and just to bring it back to that Fitbit,
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:38.180]  I guess that was the criticism was that it wasn't going after the serious
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:42.180]  fitness market because it doesn't have a GPS. Right. You know, the,
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:45.180]  the marathon runners aren't using that, that model.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:48.180]  And I don't think it's going to be enough of a,
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:52.180]  an Apple watch to beat Apple or even the Google
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:56.180]  watches at being a more general purpose device. So.
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:00.180]  Anything else you want to talk about this week, Dan?
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.180]  Um, not really.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:07.180]  There was, you know what, what do you want to talk about?
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:11.180]  Well, I was going to say there was, uh, uh, it comes and goes,
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:16.180]  but it's, it, you know, I don't write about finance generally,
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.180]  but I'm, I'm somewhat intrigued by it.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.180]  And I don't think that the company is immune to it.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:23.180]  I think even if you're primarily interested in Apple because of their
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:26.180]  products, as I am, that you,
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:31.180]  you still have to consider their like stock price and their, you know,
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.180]  quarterly financials because you know, they're a publicly held company and it,
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.180]  we're at a point, the whole market is down quite frankly,
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:42.180]  but Apple is down further than the market and they're trading at a
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:46.180]  ridiculously low price to earning ratio at the moment.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:50.180]  And it brings, it just brings out the crazies.
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.180]  I mean, you cannot make this up. I mean, this guy, Trip Chaudry is,
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:57.180]  is almost comically,
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:00.180]  it really is hard to believe that he's not a parody,
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:03.180]  that there's somebody out there who made up the name and you know,
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.180]  like the McElope and it's, it,
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.180]  it's a fake analyst who doesn't even exist and for years now he's been getting
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:13.180]  away with this and getting quoted and he keeps saying more and more outrageous
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.180]  things and everybody just keeps quoting him that, you know,
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:20.180]  putting the word analyst in front of your name is somehow this magical
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.180]  credibility badge. He literally said last week,
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:29.180]  he called Tim Cook a bozo and called for him to be not fired.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:33.180]  He called for him to be demoted back to chief operating officer.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.180]  Amazing.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:38.180]  And says that John Rubenstein should come back to the company and become the
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:43.180]  CEO. Perfect. Which is not going to happen.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:48.180]  That is the way it works. Maybe co CEO with Fidel, I guess. Yeah.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:51.180]  Bring back them all back. And that Angela Arntz is a nitwit or something.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.180]  I forget what his word was and you know, she's got to go. Meanwhile,
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:58.180]  Apple stores have never been more popular, more successful.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:01.180]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:05.180]  There is a lot of,
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:12.180]  I wouldn't say pessimism as much as just kind of people are not quite sure if
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:16.180]  iPhone sales are going to grow this year. And I don't know,
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:20.180]  maybe that doesn't matter to the average person.
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:25.180]  It does matter to Apple as a growth story.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:29.180]  And growth certainly is important in any company.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:34.180]  And, you know, sure, there are cycles where things flatten out,
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.180]  or maybe they decrease a little and they start growing again.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:44.180]  And yes, Apple, you know, relative to the market, that's one thing.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:48.180]  But there are companies that whose stock performed great last year.
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.180]  I believe Amazon was one. Amazon.
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:54.180]  It seems like everybody is really, really caught on to,
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:56.180]  and I think deservedly so. I mean, but,
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.180]  but just little things like the way that Amazon by most, you know,
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:05.180]  the accounting I've seen got 51% of the online holiday shopping.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:09.180]  That's an enormous number. And it's sort of a magic number, too.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:14.180]  You know, like, fundamentally, if they got 49% of it instead of 51%,
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:16.180]  it's, you know, it's the same. It's a rounding error,
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.180]  and probably well within the margin of error for however
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:22.180]  the outside group guesstimated the numbers.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:26.180]  But 51 is, you know, over that 50% line, and that's a magic number.
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:31.180]  And you can see why that would fuel, you know, investor confidence in their stock.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:38.180]  Yeah. So in the meantime, you have, you know, this huge group of analysts
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:42.180]  who try to guess every quarter how many phones Apple's going to sell
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:44.180]  and what their revenue and profits are going to be.
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:49.180]  And what's been happening recently is that they've been reducing their forecast
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:53.180]  for iPhone sales and for, I think, also for revenue.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:57.180]  I don't have the trend line in front of me.
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:00.180]  I actually have access to what I thought would be an interesting chart
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:03.180]  of, like, how the estimates change over time.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.180]  But they actually change so little that it's just kind of a flat line.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:10.180]  It's not actually a very interesting chart.
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:14.180]  But we'll see. I mean, yeah, this could possibly be a year.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.180]  And by the way, this has been known for a while.
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:22.180]  Like, I think I wrote about this in, I would say, July or even April of last year
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:28.180]  that this coming year could be the year where the company doesn't grow very much,
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:32.180]  at all. And we'll see.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:36.180]  I mean, you know, it certainly does matter for some reasons,
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:39.180]  but it also seems to be creating an opportunity for a lot of people
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:44.180]  to blow things out of context and be silly about things.
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:49.180]  There's a very interesting story here, I think, but it's all nuanced
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:52.180]  and it requires, you know, to be, let's be serious about this,
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:56.180]  that this company, the biggest company in the world is not going to implode.
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:01.180]  It's like we're talking about growth stopping, not that the iPhone is going to.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:05.180]  The way some of these people are talking about it is as though,
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:06.180]  I mean, here's the literal headline.
[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:09.180]  The iPhone slowdown spells doom for Apple.
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:13.180]  I mean, that's an actual headline in an ostensibly serious business publication.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:16.180]  It's ridiculous. It doesn't spell doom.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.180]  But it certainly is interesting.
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:21.180]  And I think it's almost, if you're realistic about it,
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:26.180]  you have to admit that just back of the envelope math would suggest
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:29.180]  that the basic story is actually very easy.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:34.180]  iPhone sales were suppressed for at least a year or two, it seems,
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:38.180]  because consumers decided they liked bigger phones
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.180]  and the iPhone didn't have a big phone.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.180]  And it takes Apple at least two years to make a change like that
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:49.180]  because of their, we only do one major new design a year
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.180]  and we bet the bank on it.
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.180]  They're stuck with it for two years.
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:58.180]  And when the 6 and 6S came out, or the 6 and 6 Plus came out last year,
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:03.180]  there was, A, it satisfied the demand, but B, it was pent up
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:06.180]  because a lot of people had waited and there were rumors.
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:11.180]  I mean, anybody like us knows casual people who are like,
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.180]  hey, is it true that Apple's going to come out with a bigger phone?
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:15.180]  And we'd be like, well, give your standard.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:18.180]  I don't know, but it certainly seems like it.
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:20.180]  That's what all signs point to.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.180]  And they were like, cool, I'm going to get that.
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:23.180]  And they waited for it.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:26.180]  And then they did and they had unbelievable sales.
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:29.180]  I think that the sales so far, from what we know,
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:32.180]  that the 6S and the 6S Plus are matching that,
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.180]  but the question is are they going to grow even further?
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.180]  And they may not.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:39.180]  But the thing that's also very obvious is that at this point,
[01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:42.180]  they're getting to the point where they're running out of people
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:44.180]  on the planet who can afford iPhones.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:48.180]  Right, which they're maybe actually going to help out
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:56.180]  with the second hand-me-down subscription phones this year.
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:58.180]  We'll see.
[01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:01.180]  At this point, though, they're reaching the point
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:06.180]  where I really think that to grow, it has to be at the lower end
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.180]  by widening the number of phones, lower cost phones
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.180]  that are being sold that are iPhones.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:13.180]  Because at the high end, I really do think
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:21.180]  that they're at the point where there just aren't untapped people left.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:24.180]  Yeah, there are a few Google employees with Nexus phones
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:27.180]  and then that's about it.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.180]  And that's where other products come into play, too,
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.180]  like the watch or the Apple TV,
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:34.180]  but those are both so early in their life cycle
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:37.180]  that there's even Apple Music, which we calculated
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:41.180]  is on a billion dollar revenue run rate.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.180]  A billion dollars is not that much to Apple.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:47.180]  How many watches do we think that they sold?
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:50.180]  The last time I ran, after last quarter,
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.180]  my number was around 5 million,
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:56.180]  just based on the changes in that other products thing.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.180]  It could be a little more than that,
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:53:02.180]  but the Christmas quarter is probably going to be on another level.
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.180]  We'll know in a few weeks.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.180]  Just making up a completely random number,
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:08.180]  I would guess that they probably moved
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:10.180]  5 to 10 million last quarter alone,
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.180]  but who knows? I have no idea.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:18.180]  Right, and each one of those that...
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.180]  The average selling price is easily guessed at around $500
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:25.180]  because overwhelmingly most of them are sport
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.180]  and the sport ones are $400
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:28.180]  and then just enough of those steel ones
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:30.180]  would raise it up to around $500.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:35.180]  So if every million that they sell is $500 in revenue,
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:37.180]  that's... what is that?
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:41.180]  So basically a billion for every 2 million phones,
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:42.180]  their watches.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.180]  And so they've built in year one
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:46.180]  a multi-billion dollar business,
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.180]  which is pretty good and I think it's about the best.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.180]  Not bad, yeah.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:50.180]  But if you're Apple,
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.180]  it's not going to really drive much growth,
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.180]  especially if you have to offset the iPad declining
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:54:01.180]  and the Mac has been up,
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.180]  but it sometimes falls and that sort of stuff.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.180]  Yeah, my guess is that the iPad is stabilized.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:09.180]  I think that the iPad is going to settle in
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:14.180]  as a 9 to 10 million a quarter device
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.180]  in the same way that the Mac has long been
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:19.180]  a very, very stable product,
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:23.180]  but it's actually grown in a very nice
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:27.180]  but conservative way where in the old days,
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:30.180]  like 10, 15 years ago,
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:33.180]  it was like a million Macs a quarter was the magic number.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:36.180]  Good quarters were over a million and bad quarters
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.180]  were under a million.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:40.180]  And it's slowly but steadily grown to the point now
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:42.180]  where they're doing like three, four,
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:45.180]  four and a half million Macs a quarter.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.180]  More?
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:47.180]  Is it more now?
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.180]  Yeah.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:53.180]  Well, I'm going to pull out my spreadsheet here,
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:54.180]  so give me 10 seconds,
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:58.180]  but let's see, last quarter was 5.7.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:54:59.180]  There you go.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:00.180]  I'm behind the times.
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:01.180]  So they've grown past five.
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:03.180]  Which is, I believe, a record.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.180]  Right.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.180]  All-time record.
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.180]  You know, and I noticed though,
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.180]  I noticed just the other day I saw a guy in a Starbucks
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:14.180]  and he was working on an old,
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.180]  remember the white MacBooks?
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:18.180]  Remember the ones that you could either get white or black?
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:19.180]  And he was working on one of those.
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:21.180]  It was in beautiful shape.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.180]  It was absolutely, it really was.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:27.180]  It was totally clean and the screen looked great
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:28.180]  and he was working on like,
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:31.180]  I couldn't tell which app, it was either Excel or Numbers.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.180]  It was clearly a spreadsheet.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.180]  Doing work on it and it looked great.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.180]  So I had no surprise that he's still using it.
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:39.180]  But that's what normal people do,
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:42.180]  is they buy a MacBook or a laptop
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:44.180]  and they use it until it breaks.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:47.180]  Hey, this is a 2009 iMac we're using,
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:49.180]  so we're chatting right now.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.180]  Right, and I feel like the iPad,
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:55.180]  you know, my theory on the iPad is that it sold
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:58.180]  in these 20 million a quarter numbers
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.180]  because it was this sensational new thing
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:04.180]  that met a demand that no product had ever met before
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:06.180]  and lots of people decided,
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:07.180]  hey, I could use one of those
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.180]  and they weren't replacing anything.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.180]  They were adding it to their life
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:13.180]  and so it was way out of proportion
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.180]  to what could be expected in a normal quarter
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.180]  and that now it's settled in
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:21.180]  and it's settled in I think roughly like
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.180]  somewhere around two times the number of Macs they sell.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:26.180]  And that that's the natural number of iPads
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:28.180]  to be sold a quarter.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:32.180]  Yeah, and hey, I just bought an iPad 2 off eBay
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.180]  just to use as a screen.
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:36.180]  So the old ones have value too.
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.180]  Yeah, and again, I don't think people get rid of them
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.180]  until they break.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:41.180]  No, I had to stop using my original iPad
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:44.180]  because it was still on I think iOS 5
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:49.180]  and the app we were using to watch TV on
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:51.180]  needed iOS 7 I think.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:58.180]  So got an iPad 2 and now I'm solved.
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:56:59.180]  So I don't know.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:03.180]  I think that the hyperventilating over this is ridiculous.
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:04.180]  I do think it's interesting though.
[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:07.180]  It's interesting to say what does Apple do
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:11.180]  now that the iPhone has reached peak iPhone?
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:16.180]  Right, and much like when they mess something small up
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.180]  with the product, people love to jump on it.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:23.180]  So imagine the whole company collapsing
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:27.180]  or not collapsing, but actually just not growing like crazy
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:30.180]  for a few quarters in a row.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:32.180]  But yeah, what do they do?
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:38.180]  They've done a few things and we'll see.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:40.180]  Well, and I think in terms of anybody
[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:42.180]  who's looking for growth,
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:44.180]  I don't see how the watch could have done better
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.180]  in the first year.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:47.180]  And honestly, I've given the numbers it's gotten.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.180]  I think that they've sold outside the number,
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:51.180]  outside how well it deserves to have sold.
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:54.180]  I don't think it's that great of a 1.0 product,
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:56.180]  but it's actually remarkable that they're selling
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.180]  as many millions of them as it seems like they are.
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:01.180]  And I think that's great.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.180]  And I think it's only going to get better.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:05.180]  And they do really, in the last few years,
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:08.180]  they've really, with every product since the iPad,
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:12.180]  they do an amazing job in the first two or three years
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.180]  of greatly improving the product.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:19.180]  I mean, the iPad went from the iPad to the iPad 2,
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:20.180]  which was way thinner.
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:22.180]  Then there was the iPad 3, which was weird
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:24.180]  because it went retina, but it got thicker and heavier,
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.180]  which was a weird sort of,
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.180]  now you have this awesome retina screen,
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:28.180]  but it's also thicker and heavier.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.180]  And then ever since, from that point onward,
[01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:34.180]  it's just gotten crazily thinner and faster and lighter.
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:37.180]  And so I expect the exact same trajectory with the watch
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:40.180]  with a very aggressive annual schedule.
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.180]  Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:44.180]  I've liked mine a lot more than I thought I would.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:50.180]  But it's still a long way to get between now
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:53.180]  and 100 million units a year.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:55.180]  The other, one last thing I thought of from CES
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.180]  was that, and it sort of ties into the,
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:58:59.180]  what does Apple do now?
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:00.180]  And it sort of ties into my thing about
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:03.180]  maybe they shouldn't have done apps on the watch,
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:05.180]  was, I think it was Dieter Bone for The Verge
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:08.180]  had an article about Tizen, which is Samsung's,
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:12.180]  not Android, their own homegrown operating system.
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:14.180]  And that maybe it's going to do okay,
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.180]  even though it never, nobody,
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.180]  there's no app developers targeting Tizen.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:25.180]  And that's sort of the problem that Windows exemplifies,
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:30.180]  is that at best, usually there's just one dominant platform
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:32.180]  that developers write for.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.180]  In the old days, it used to be the Windows.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:37.180]  Then it became, on the desktop, then it became the web.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:39.180]  And nowadays, it's split.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.180]  People still develop for the web,
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:43.180]  but on mobile, people develop for iOS
[01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:45.180]  and they develop for Android.
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:48.180]  And if you're trying to be the third, you're out of luck,
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:51.180]  because there's just too much to ask.
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:53.180]  So Windows doesn't really get apps.
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.180]  And Tizen certainly gets less than Windows.
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:59.180]  But that maybe, I guess what he was writing about
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:02.180]  was these Samsung watches that are running Tizen.
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:06.180]  And it occurs to me that as we move past the phone
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:08.180]  and get into these other devices,
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:11.180]  platforms going forward and operating systems,
[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:13.180]  apps may not need to be a part of that.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.180]  And having your own operating system
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:18.180]  that you inside your company completely control
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:21.180]  and you can have your engineers optimize it.
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.180]  What you really want to work on is low energy consumption.
[02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:27.180]  Well, you can make that the highest priority
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.180]  because you have your own operating system.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:34.180]  Or if you want to do like what Apple's done with Metal
[02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:37.180]  and make this incredibly custom
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:40.180]  and high performance graphics pipeline,
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.180]  you can do that and you can bake that
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:44.180]  into the operating system at whatever point
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:46.180]  where it makes the most sense for your desires
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.180]  because you control the operating system.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.180]  I just think that a lot of these things going forward
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.180]  that are going to become computerized,
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:54.180]  they don't need apps.
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:56.180]  And therefore, it doesn't matter if, you know,
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.180]  if Samsung can do a good watch and it runs Tizen,
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:00.180]  but there's no third party apps for it,
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:01.180]  that may not matter at all.
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:03.180]  And where I'm going with this is,
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:05.180]  to me, the car might be the same thing,
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:07.180]  where what you want out of your computerized car
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:09.180]  has nothing to do with third party apps.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.180]  Right, or your, I mean, so Tizen is also being used,
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:16.180]  I believe, in many of their televisions
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:20.180]  as well as the new fridge with a tablet built into it
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.180]  and a bunch of this stuff.
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:23.180]  And, you know, you can laugh,
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:25.180]  but if every gadget is eventually
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.180]  going to have a screen on it,
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.180]  you know, your washing machine or something,
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.180]  and the value of the apps,
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:33.180]  the logic is mostly running in the cloud
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:36.180]  and what you're interacting with
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:38.180]  is just, you know, either a notification
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:42.180]  or a, you know, just a button that basically says,
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:44.180]  run this app in the background
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:47.180]  or respond to a notification or something,
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.180]  then absolutely, it doesn't,
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:52.180]  you don't really need all the UI development
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:56.180]  or, you know, a separate app running on the device.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:02:00.180]  Did you see the summon feature for the Teslas?
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.180]  You know, I feel dumb
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:04.180]  because I actually had heard about that before
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:07.180]  but I didn't realize it hadn't been announced.
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:09.180]  Yeah, I saw that, it's cool.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:11.180]  And that's the type of stuff that I think,
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.180]  this is the revolution that's coming to the car industry
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.180]  and it has nothing to do with apps, right?
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:19.180]  Like, the fact that you can't get apps for your Tesla
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:22.180]  does not change anybody's desire to buy a Tesla at all
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:23.180]  in either direction.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:26.180]  Whether you didn't want one before or you do,
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.180]  the fact that it's not an app platform is irrelevant.
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.180]  It's the fact that the car can do,
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:33.180]  apps are just the wrong concept for a car.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:34.180]  They really are.
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.180]  I mean, I know that there's certain things like,
[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:40.180]  maybe you would want something app-like for music
[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:41.180]  but it doesn't have to be apps,
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:44.180]  you just want to get music in your car.
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:46.180]  And, yep, so the summon feature is really cool.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:49.180]  It's like, you can, you tell your Tesla
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:51.180]  that you're ready to go to work
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:54.180]  and the Tesla will like, open the garage door,
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:58.180]  get outside and be right there at the curb
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:02.180]  ready for you to get in and drive.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:03.180]  And when you get home,
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:05.180]  you can just get out of the Tesla in front of your house
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.180]  and go in the front door
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:10.180]  and the Tesla will go through the nitpicky detail
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:13.180]  of carefully driving itself into your garage.
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:16.180]  And like, the crazy long-term thing they said was like,
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:19.180]  if you're in LA, you're going to be in the garage
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:22.180]  like if you're in LA, your car will drive from New York
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:24.180]  and come pick you up or something like that.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:26.180]  Right, that's absolutely, yeah.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:28.180]  Right, right now it's like limited to a very,
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:30.180]  very near proximity around your house or whatever,
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:33.180]  but that they've already got it in place,
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:35.180]  you know, plans in place where you'll be able to do it
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.180]  from any distance where there's contiguous land access.
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:40.180]  So, you know, you can't make your car magically
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:42.180]  get itself to Hawaii, but you can.
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:43.180]  Yet.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.180]  Yeah, but you can go LA to New York.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.180]  Yeah, I love this.
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:54.180]  You know, I think that the concept of a car
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:57.180]  and of transport is really changing a lot.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:04:02.180]  And yeah, I mean, it was funny because CES was literally
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:06.180]  the week before the biggest car show in the world,
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.180]  but it's there that a lot of these companies
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.180]  were making their big announcements
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:12.180]  because they're all trying to position themselves
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:13.180]  as technology companies now.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:17.180]  And, you know, some of them are going to,
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:22.180]  what I love about Tesla is just that these ideas are so wacky,
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:25.180]  but then they just released a software update
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:27.180]  and they're there, like the self-driving mode.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:29.180]  I don't think anyone the week before was like,
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:32.180]  oh, I wonder when my Tesla is going to be able to drive itself.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.180]  And then Elon Musk is like, here it is, boom.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.180]  And I think they even have to dial it back now
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:40.180]  because it was like a little too crazy.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:43.180]  But I love it.
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:45.180]  Did I mention this on the show?
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.180]  I forget if I did or not.
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:48.180]  I have such a terrible podcast amnesia,
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:52.180]  but that I got to ride in a self-driving Mercedes Benz.
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:53.180]  Oh, cool.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.180]  And it was amazing.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.180]  It's truly, truly amazing.
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:59.180]  Mercedes flew a bunch of, not a bunch,
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.180]  a small number of riders out.
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:02.180]  And I don't know why they picked me,
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.180]  but I didn't question it.
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:06.180]  Where'd you go?
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:08.180]  Sunnydale? Sunnyvale? Mountain View?
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:09.180]  Oh, okay.
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.180]  Somewhere out there.
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:11.180]  Somewhere out, it's out in the valley.
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:14.180]  Down the street from Yahoo.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:18.180]  And got to ride in a self-driving S-Class.
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:22.180]  We went out on the highway and the car drove, did everything.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.180]  It was amazing.
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.180]  And it works.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:26.180]  It absolutely works.
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:28.180]  And it's not perfect yet, obviously.
[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:30.180]  But if anything, all of the imperfections
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.180]  are on the side of being conservative.
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:35.180]  It's a very heavy breaker.
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:38.180]  It breaks very, very aggressively.
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:40.180]  We were heading up an on-ramp to get onto a highway
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:42.180]  and go high-speed driving.
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:44.180]  And it was later in the afternoon,
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:47.180]  and we were heading right into the sun.
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:49.180]  And basically, just talking to their engineers,
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:51.180]  all of the things that make driving hard for humans
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.180]  are the exact same thing that make self-driving hard.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.180]  If you have trouble seeing,
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:57.180]  the cameras on the car have trouble seeing as well.
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:59.180]  And it was really a lot of glare.
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:01.180]  And it braked going up the ramp
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:04.180]  because the glare was so bad that it couldn't really even see.
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:06.180]  It was like the status indicated,
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:08.180]  it was just like, can't tell what's ahead.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:10.180]  Therefore, it's going to stop.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:13.180]  And it was an unnatural thing that a human wouldn't have done.
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:15.180]  And a couple of other times,
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:17.180]  it broke a little bit too aggressively.
[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:19.180]  But for the most part, I think you could easily,
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:22.180]  if you didn't tell somebody and blindfolded them,
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:25.180]  I think that you could easily,
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:28.180]  the cars they already have today could easily fool somebody
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:31.180]  in thinking that a human did the driving.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.180]  That's great.
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:34.180]  Yeah, that's going to be awesome.
[02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:37.180]  So one of the questions I asked them was,
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:38.180]  do they anticipate,
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.180]  and that they're obviously solving,
[02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:43.180]  they're solving really, really fascinating
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:45.180]  AI engineering problems,
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:47.180]  hardware, software, sensors,
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:49.180]  the braking systems and the software,
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.180]  of course, to drive all this.
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:53.180]  But they're also solving legislative
[02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:56.180]  and regulatory problems at the same time.
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:58.180]  And do they, like right now,
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:00.180]  I said I could go buy a Mercedes Benz.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:02.180]  Any Benz I drive off the lot,
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:05.180]  I can instantly go and greatly exceed
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.180]  any speed limit in the United States
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:08.180]  at my own discretion.
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:11.180]  Will I have that ability in a self-driving car?
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:15.180]  And I was told quite bluntly, no.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.180]  There's almost no chance that it would be legal
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:19.180]  for them to make a self-driving car
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:20.180]  that will exceed speed limits,
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:21.180]  which is kind of weird.
[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:25.180]  And it's going to drive the sort of libertarian mindset
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:27.180]  at people, I think, a little nutty.
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:28.180]  But their explanation was,
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.180]  but why do you want to drive faster now?
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:33.180]  It's because you're bored.
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:36.180]  And if you're not paying attention to the road,
[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:38.180]  if you're just reading or watching TV
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:39.180]  or whatever on your way to work,
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:43.180]  you're not going to care that it takes five minutes longer.
[02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:44.180]  Totally.
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:46.180]  And I think I also saw something similar
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:51.180]  with the Tesla thing where it's programmed
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:52.180]  that it could maybe go, I think,
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.180]  five miles over the limit or something like that
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:55.180]  based on where it is.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.180]  I'm not sure.
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.180]  I may be making that up.
[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:59.180]  But I thought I read something about that.
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.180]  And then, of course, if you need to go faster,
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:05.180]  there's the flying car that they had at CES, too,
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:10.180]  the scary quadcopter with a person in it.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:11.180]  Did you see that?
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.180]  No, I did not.
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:13.180]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.180]  It was like a human-sized drone.
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:16.180]  Oh, God.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.180]  So great.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:20.180]  So we've got that to look forward to.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:21.180]  The one thing talking to people at Mercedes
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:27.180]  is they were very, you know,
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:29.180]  they are very confident in their ability
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:32.180]  and that they are going to have world-class self-driving cars.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:34.180]  I mean, I rode in one that already was real,
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:36.180]  the real deal.
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:40.180]  But they divide the stages of self-driving cars
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:42.180]  in, like, four levels.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:44.180]  And level one is the stuff that we already have
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:46.180]  you can get on the market today
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:48.180]  where you can set your car to maintain distance
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:50.180]  from the car in front of it
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:54.180]  and that Tesla has a feature where you can turn on the thing
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:59.180]  and it'll do the highway driving for you.
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:02.180]  But part of stage one is that stage one means
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:05.180]  you still have a human driver who is expected
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:09.180]  to be able to take over the control of the car in an instant,
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:13.180]  like, hands ready to take over at all times.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.180]  And that's where the industry is today
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:17.180]  in terms of, like, what's on the market
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:19.180]  and that they were absolutely...
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:21.180]  They considered it almost seemingly.
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.180]  This wasn't what they said, but reading between the lines,
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:25.180]  it seemed like they were angry
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:28.180]  and it was, like, a setback to the industry
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.180]  that when Tesla first made this feature available
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.180]  that jackasses were setting up GoPros
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:34.180]  and showing themselves, like, reading the newspaper
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:36.180]  while their car drove.
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:39.180]  Like, there was a guy who got in the backseat of his Tesla
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:43.180]  while it was on, like, a highway in California.
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:45.180]  And that it's so... That's not...
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:47.180]  That's not... You're not supposed to do that.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:51.180]  And somebody's gonna do that in a disaster.
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.180]  You know, they're gonna have a catastrophic accident
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:56.180]  because of it and it's going to, you know...
[02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.180]  The fear is it's gonna make people say
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.180]  we should ban self-driving cars
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:05.180]  before they even get a chance to do it.
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:07.180]  Like, who would do that?
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:08.180]  What kind of a...
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:09.180]  Yeah.
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:10.180]  And it really is funny.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:14.180]  It's just like some random yahoo with a Tesla
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:16.180]  is gonna ruin this for everybody.
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:18.180]  Yeah, I think if you go on YouTube
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.180]  and search, like, Tesla fail,
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:23.180]  you'll find some people who were very surprised
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:25.180]  by what they were recording.
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:29.180]  But, yeah, I mean, it's interesting.
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:33.180]  And I'm sure we've seen other tech examples.
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:35.180]  I mean, it's not too dissimilar
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.180]  from what we're seeing with Airbnb and Uber,
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:40.180]  where, you know, there's the company
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:42.180]  that wants to kind of skirt the way
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:45.180]  that things have always been and then reality,
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:47.180]  which will fit somewhere in the middle.
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:49.180]  I just think bottom line for Apple is that
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:51.180]  until they get to their car comes out,
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:53.180]  which is, even if everything goes swimmingly,
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:55.180]  it's gonna be, you know, 2020, 21
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:58.180]  or something like that, I think.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:01.180]  I don't see how they can get it out before 2020.
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.180]  But who knows?
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.180]  But even if I'm wrong,
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:06.180]  it's not gonna be that much earlier.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.180]  Until then, I don't see how they can do anything
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:13.180]  to create, like, a totally...
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:17.180]  grossly inflate the revenue of the company, right?
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:19.180]  Like, watches and other things
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:20.180]  that they could do in the interim.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.180]  The watch is a good business, but like you said,
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:24.180]  like, a billion here and a billion there
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:26.180]  doesn't move the line for Apple very much.
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:28.180]  Right, unless it's the kind of thing
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.180]  where almost everyone with an iPhone gets one, too.
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:34.180]  But then it's still smaller than the iPhone.
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.180]  It's still basically accessory level.
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:39.180]  But I think that Wall Street's desire
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:42.180]  for Apple to do that is just magical thinking.
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:45.180]  And I think it's good, as somebody who wants the company
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:47.180]  to continue doing good work,
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:49.180]  it's good that they're, by all appearances,
[02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:53.180]  are not obsessed with finding another iPhone.
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:55.180]  You know, I think that they knew going into it
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:11:57.180]  that the watch was not going to be like the iPhone
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:58.180]  and they did it anyway.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:00.180]  And I think that's as it should be.
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:01.180]  I think it's, you know,
[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:04.180]  the phone is like a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:08.180]  Yeah, I don't think anything can be like the iPhone,
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:11.180]  at least in the next, you know...
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:14.180]  At least knowing what we know today about the world,
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:16.180]  I don't think there's going to be another product
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:19.180]  that is like the iPhone for Apple, period.
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:22.180]  It's just a perfect storm of everything.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:25.180]  It's this device that everybody wants one
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:30.180]  and that they have engineering advantages.
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:33.180]  And the price is hidden, you know, all that stuff.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.180]  Right, right, right.
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.180]  That nobody even knows what they're really paying for it.
[02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:39.180]  The industry just keeps finding new ways
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:42.180]  to further obfuscate just how much you're paying.
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:44.180]  Yeah, amazing.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.180]  I love it when you tell somebody that,
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.180]  like if you just buy a no-contract iPhone,
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:50.180]  that it's, you know, eight or nine hundred dollars,
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:52.180]  and they're like, well, I would never pay that.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:54.180]  But yet they have an iPhone.
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:58.180]  It's like, trust me, you're paying it.
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:00.180]  Anything else?
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:01.180]  That's good, I think.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:04.180]  All right, Dan Fromer at Quartz, that's QZ.com.
[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:08.180]  I'll make sure to throw in a couple links to your CES stuff.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:12.180]  I didn't do much, so I'll send you what I did,
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:15.180]  which was nice.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:17.180]  Well, it's always good talking to you.
[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:18.180]  Yeah, FromDome on Twitter.
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:22.180]  FromDome on Twitter, and citynotes.co.
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:51.180] .
