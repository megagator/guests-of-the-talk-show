[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Dan Fromer. I think it's been a while since you've been on the show.
[00:02.760 --> 00:05.240]  It has. Thanks for having me back. Always fun.
[00:07.800 --> 00:10.880]  We got an apple event coming up next week. We're recording on Friday,
[00:10.960 --> 00:16.120]  the 6th of September, Tuesdays, the event out in California.
[00:18.280 --> 00:21.320]  We can talk about that. Obviously we've got other stuff to talk about.
[00:21.560 --> 00:25.560]  Why don't we just start though? By talking about you, Dan. Oh, sure.
[00:25.560 --> 00:28.400]  All right, let's do it. You've, you've, you've bounced around. You've left.
[00:28.400 --> 00:31.160]  You were at Recode for a while. You were editor in chief.
[00:31.160 --> 00:32.720]  What were you at at Recode? Yeah.
[00:32.760 --> 00:37.680]  Editor in chief for about two and a half years until the end of last
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.840]  year and late last year. Now you're, you're, you're, you're on your own again,
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.640]  which makes me happy. It makes me feel like I'm less alone.
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.200]  Yeah. Um, you know, I've always,
[00:48.240 --> 00:52.960]  I've always admired and yearned for the indie publisher
[00:52.960 --> 00:55.800]  lifestyle. And, um, you know,
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.200]  those who've heard me on this show before may remember, uh, what was it?
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.040]  Eight years ago, I started a, an indie site called splat F,
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.440]  which was covering apple and the greater apple ecosystem. Um,
[01:08.480 --> 01:13.440]  but that was, uh, during the era of, uh, banner ads.
[01:13.480 --> 01:14.520]  And, um,
[01:15.480 --> 01:19.920]  it proved not to be a great business model for a small indie,
[01:20.680 --> 01:24.400]  um, publication, even one with a, with a really high end audience. And, uh,
[01:24.400 --> 01:27.880]  and so I, you know, I had a, I had some really amazing, uh,
[01:27.920 --> 01:32.480]  job opportunities that I ended up taking for, um, basically six years.
[01:32.520 --> 01:36.760]  And, um, and in that, in the meantime, the, uh,
[01:36.800 --> 01:39.960]  the subscription model has really taken off. Um, you know,
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.600]  I give all credit to, I think, you know,
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.160]  I'm pretty sure in all industries, not just tech,
[01:45.160 --> 01:49.080]  but Ben Thompson is really the one with Stratechery who, um, you know,
[01:49.080 --> 01:52.280]  it was just kind of getting started as I was, um,
[01:52.280 --> 01:56.560]  kind of shutting down splat F, but this, um, you know,
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.640]  this model of charging people a hundred or two or $300 a year for
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.760]  access to, um, you know, in theory and newsletter, but also a website and,
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.640]  and, you know, probably much more, um, has really taken off,
[02:09.640 --> 02:12.080]  especially for things that, uh,
[02:12.120 --> 02:15.840]  are professionally oriented that people can, you know,
[02:15.840 --> 02:20.360]  expense to their business or at least write off their taxes. And,
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.120]  and, um, and so I started one, I left, I left Recode, uh, end of last year.
[02:25.120 --> 02:28.480]  And, and beginning of this year started something, uh,
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.600]  called the new consumer, which you can find out at new consumer.com. Um,
[02:33.920 --> 02:34.560]  it,
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.480]  it takes my almost 15 years as a journalist covering technology
[02:39.840 --> 02:40.680]  and, uh,
[02:40.680 --> 02:44.400]  applies those lessons to kind of the field that I'm most interested in
[02:44.400 --> 02:47.640]  personally, which is consumer. Um, there's, you know,
[02:47.640 --> 02:50.640]  it's a golden era of e-commerce, a golden era of consumer.
[02:50.640 --> 02:53.120]  You see all these new direct to consumer brands launching.
[02:53.120 --> 02:56.760]  You see big companies like Amazon taking over the world.
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.920]  You see really interesting, um, you know, new brands,
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.880]  many of which sponsor podcasts like this one. And, uh,
[03:05.120 --> 03:07.520]  very true. Yeah, it's very true. Yeah.
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.640]  And many of them have been enabled by technology in a way that earlier brands
[03:11.640 --> 03:13.880]  have not, uh, whether that is, you know,
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.760]  literally selling a technology based product or service,
[03:17.800 --> 03:20.280]  or using technology, uh,
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.440]  and digital marketing as the way that they, um,
[03:24.480 --> 03:28.840]  attract their customers and, and even, you know, using, uh,
[03:28.880 --> 03:33.680]  technology, um, kind of culture to iterate on their product. So,
[03:34.600 --> 03:37.720]  um, anyway, so I launched the new consumer, uh, in March,
[03:38.080 --> 03:39.600]  actually at the Apple event where we,
[03:39.600 --> 03:43.840]  I think I sat next to you at the Apple services event and, um,
[03:43.840 --> 03:47.960]  have been doing it since then. It's, um, it's been going great. It's, you know,
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.360]  it is designed for professionals. It's $200 a year, um,
[03:52.400 --> 03:57.040]  which gets you two emails a week from me. Uh, and the, you know,
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.920]  the model is very similar to how much is it, how much is it again?
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.600]  It's $200 a year. And I, at the, at now, for now,
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.400]  I only offer an annual membership. Um, you know,
[04:07.400 --> 04:12.320]  part of that was to get that money upfront to almost as a Kickstarter
[04:12.760 --> 04:15.760]  for, for my business. But, uh, you know, I, I am,
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.800]  I'm an ambitious person and I see it over time as being much more than just a
[04:19.800 --> 04:21.280]  newsletter, um, you know, and,
[04:21.280 --> 04:25.960]  and a membership at a community that I really want people who are focused on
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.200]  the big picture in the longterm to, to be a part of. So I might, um, you know,
[04:31.200 --> 04:33.040]  Ben, Ben and many others, it's funny,
[04:33.040 --> 04:36.280]  I subscribed to probably four or five of these now. Um, you know,
[04:36.280 --> 04:40.960]  I'm sure many of the listeners to this show know about above Avalon from Neil
[04:40.960 --> 04:44.080]  Seibart, which is a really great Apple kind of, uh,
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.000]  investor financial investor focused financial analysis of Apple and also the
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.920]  tech world, you know, through the lens of Apple. Um,
[04:51.920 --> 04:54.360]  but there's a great one that I get, uh,
[04:54.400 --> 04:58.880]  by John Ostrower covering the aviation industry. Um,
[04:58.960 --> 05:01.080]  there there's a bunch of them and, you know, I,
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.200]  I guess the athletic is kind of the athletic is like a consumer version of
[05:05.200 --> 05:08.240]  this, right? Covering sports. Um, it's less expensive.
[05:08.680 --> 05:12.680]  Few people are expensing the athletic. I am because I write about the media
[05:12.680 --> 05:16.520]  industry, but most people are not expensing the athletic. Um,
[05:17.400 --> 05:21.200]  and you know, of course the model is do some free articles here and there. Uh,
[05:21.200 --> 05:21.760]  I should,
[05:21.760 --> 05:25.720]  I would love to get to the pace of doing one free article a week in addition to
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.080]  the two paid ones. And, um, you know,
[05:29.080 --> 05:32.160]  and try to do something that no one else is doing. So it's not, you know,
[05:32.160 --> 05:37.160]  I'm not writing, um, straight news articles. I'm doing analysis.
[05:37.400 --> 05:41.800]  I'm doing commentary. I'm, um, you know, following up somewhat.
[05:41.800 --> 05:45.880]  It's so interesting how you can just follow up on something and be the only
[05:45.880 --> 05:48.240]  person who's following up on something. If, you know,
[05:48.240 --> 05:51.400]  companies make these big announcements all the time and, um, you know,
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.800]  and a lot of them don't really work out or work out differently than people
[05:54.800 --> 05:59.040]  imagine. So, um, I, I try to focus on the why and the how,
[05:59.040 --> 06:03.760]  and, um, you know, it's a lot about e-commerce. I, the tag is kind of, it's,
[06:03.760 --> 06:08.480]  uh, it's a publication about how and why people spend their time and money. Um,
[06:08.520 --> 06:13.320]  and, uh, you know, almost, almost six months in, it's great. I love it. Um,
[06:13.360 --> 06:16.520]  I'm sticking with it. The, the caliber of the,
[06:16.520 --> 06:18.880]  of the membership is really fantastic. Um,
[06:18.880 --> 06:23.200]  I really believe in the model and it's perfect for someone like me who really
[06:23.200 --> 06:28.200]  wants to control all aspects of the, of the publication and the business.
[06:28.200 --> 06:32.600]  You know, I designed the WordPress template myself. Um, I made the logo. I,
[06:32.600 --> 06:35.280]  you know, I love doing all that sort of stuff. I wish I had,
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.640]  you're a man after my own heart.
[06:36.960 --> 06:40.720]  Yeah. I mean, I wish I had more time to, um, you know,
[06:40.720 --> 06:44.720]  make the charts and do all that stuff. But part of it is just the,
[06:44.720 --> 06:48.160]  the craziness of, and really the opportunity to do all of it.
[06:48.200 --> 06:50.960]  And I love this model. I love that. Um,
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.400]  I love seeing people jump into it and, um, it's been really great so far.
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.200]  It, we, we are of it like when we look back on it,
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.160]  it's like, all right, me, I have an interesting,
[07:04.200 --> 07:07.120]  I've carved out an interesting career, but, uh, you know,
[07:07.120 --> 07:12.320]  I have not bounced around, you know, like somehow I made it work and then I
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.800]  just keep doing the same thing. Um, but I'm, I'm, you know,
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.360]  keenly tuned in to, uh, you know,
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.760]  what's going on with solo practitioners for lack of a better term.
[07:24.760 --> 07:28.280]  There's for lack of a better word, like you and Ben and Jason Kottke and,
[07:28.280 --> 07:31.080]  and, you know, uh, but also, you know, the,
[07:31.080 --> 07:34.120]  just the whole media landscape, like the people who,
[07:34.120 --> 07:38.640]  who you and I would consider peers, you know, roughly, you know,
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.760]  of our rough generation,
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.000]  like what a crazy period to be in the media, right?
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.880]  Like it, it's so different from just when daring fireball started
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.840]  in 2002 and some of the new sites, you know,
[07:52.840 --> 07:57.720]  like places like recode and the verge and all of
[07:57.720 --> 08:00.680]  the various Vox properties. Like I'm,
[08:00.880 --> 08:03.720]  I love them and I spend an awful lot of time. I mean,
[08:03.720 --> 08:08.360]  anybody who reads during fireball knows how often I wind up linking to recode
[08:08.360 --> 08:12.520]  and Buzzfeed news and Vox. And these are all pop publications that I,
[08:12.520 --> 08:15.840]  I don't think any of the ones I just mentioned were around 10 years ago. Uh,
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.200]  maybe the verge, I forget when, when that, when that happened. But, um,
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.880]  um, and they're great. And, you know, it, you know,
[08:23.920 --> 08:28.040]  and I know so many people, uh, you know, and it's no quite, you know,
[08:28.040 --> 08:29.680]  it's just the way careers go, but, you know,
[08:29.680 --> 08:33.200]  someone like John Patzkowski is one of the great Apple beat writers, you know,
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.200]  has been at both Buzzfeed news and at recode, um, was previously, you know,
[08:38.400 --> 08:41.560]  the, I think he was at the wall street journal, right. He was there with, uh,
[08:42.120 --> 08:45.200]  just part of all things D which became recode. Right. Um,
[08:45.240 --> 08:46.840]  so recode in some ways is young,
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.120]  but also in some ways it's almost 13 years old. Right. But you know,
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.600]  it's just an interesting time, but there was a period there where,
[08:55.760 --> 08:59.960]  I wouldn't say I was depressed, but there was a period where the,
[09:00.840 --> 09:04.600]  the, the solo practitioners really seemed to be drying up.
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.160]  And I really thought that like when I made during fireball work,
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.040]  I thought this is the future and there's going to be so many people doing this.
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.040]  And then I just happened to have a leg up by a few years because in 2002 you
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.160]  still needed to be a bit of a web developer to run your own website,
[09:24.360 --> 09:27.000]  you know, like, and it was great that there were things like movable type,
[09:27.080 --> 09:29.240]  but even just in, you know,
[09:29.640 --> 09:34.200]  installing movable type was beyond the Ken of somebody who didn't have some
[09:34.200 --> 09:37.800]  kind of web development background. And then, you know, I don't know,
[09:37.800 --> 09:40.920]  at some point it seemed like it dried up and now it really seems like it's back
[09:40.920 --> 09:45.920]  on the upswing. And it's fascinating to me that it's not really through blogs.
[09:46.400 --> 09:48.080]  It's, it's like you just said,
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.080]  largely or significantly through subscription newsletters,
[09:53.720 --> 09:56.280]  you know, like, and you know, I hate to say it, you know,
[09:56.640 --> 09:58.680]  I hope he doesn't listen because he's on the show all the time,
[09:58.680 --> 10:02.200]  but Ben Thompson has done an amazing job.
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.320]  And I'm truly, I marvel at his output, you know, like he is,
[10:08.320 --> 10:13.320]  he's a machine in terms of getting his daily updates out and getting his free
[10:14.360 --> 10:17.880]  to the public, to read column out every Tuesday. I think,
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.560]  I think Tuesdays is when his a free one drops. I mean,
[10:21.560 --> 10:22.960]  week after week after week.
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.240]  Yeah. Like scary consistency. And it's always good too. It's
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.920]  it, you know, it's obviously jealousy inducing,
[10:33.920 --> 10:37.760]  but also an inspiration. And you know, and, and by the way,
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.720]  not everyone can keep that pace up or even, you know, my pace. You know,
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.760]  you see a lot of people starting newsletters and, you know,
[10:45.800 --> 10:49.280]  even my free newsletter points party, which we're talking about that later,
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.800]  but like, I haven't kept up with that nearly as much as I want to.
[10:53.680 --> 10:57.200]  But this model where you are,
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.080]  where your customers are literally, you know,
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.520]  the people you're writing for and there's a direct two way relationship.
[11:04.160 --> 11:06.560]  I think it's great. It really, really keeps me going.
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.720]  I long to be as consistent as Ben and, you know,
[11:10.720 --> 11:12.200]  if I'm still doing this in,
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.200]  I think he's been doing Stratechery now for five or six years and many of those
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.520]  full time, I would be so happy to be doing this in,
[11:21.520 --> 11:25.760]  in six or 10 years. It's to me, it's, it's, it's amazing.
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.000]  So you know, huge credit to him,
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.440]  but also to you and everyone else is doing this.
[11:31.520 --> 11:33.400]  The other thing that it plays into is,
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.400]  and there was a talk that Merlin Mann and I, like I don't know,
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.920]  God, it must've been like 2006 or 2007 at South by Southwest.
[11:42.920 --> 11:46.560]  People still watch it all the time. I think, I think it's evergreen content,
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.640]  but we're, you know, just talking about it. And it's,
[11:49.160 --> 11:51.360]  I think I was there alive. You might've been, you probably,
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.440]  I think you might've been, but I,
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.560]  and it was Merlin's point more than mine. But it was more or less
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.560]  it was more or less just finding your passion and pursuing it.
[12:06.040 --> 12:09.160]  I don't know, I'll find it for the show notes, but it's,
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.160]  it's always exciting and interesting and very obvious to me when somebody is
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.960]  writing about what they're passionate about, where, you know,
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.960]  like the worst is like going back to school.
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.960]  And like I, you know, I've turned out to be a quote unquote,
[12:28.520 --> 12:31.600]  professional writer and people seem to be a fan of my writing.
[12:31.600 --> 12:34.320]  And sometimes I feel like I'm actually doing it pretty well.
[12:35.680 --> 12:38.640]  But I think if you went back and read a lot of my stuff in high school that I
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.760]  handed in as assignments,
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.480]  it was dreadfully dull because I was bored out of my mind. Right.
[12:43.520 --> 12:46.160]  That's like, that's the worst. And sometimes even, you know,
[12:46.200 --> 12:47.920]  and you're reading a newspaper or something,
[12:47.920 --> 12:50.600]  it's like you can just kind of tell that whoever wrote this,
[12:50.600 --> 12:54.080]  just it's homework to them. And I think the opposite,
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.920]  when you can find somebody writing about something that if,
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.120]  if money were no object, if they were independently wealthy,
[13:02.160 --> 13:07.160]  they'd still want to be writing about blank and you skinned in as the reader,
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.360]  that passion,
[13:09.560 --> 13:13.960]  it's just this symbiotic relationship where you want to read more from this
[13:13.960 --> 13:18.000]  person and the person writing it wants to keep writing it because they've got
[13:18.000 --> 13:18.840]  this obsession.
[13:18.840 --> 13:22.520]  And I think the way Merlin put it was obsession times voice.
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.600]  That's great. Yeah, exactly. And to your earlier point,
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.120]  I think newsletters make it easy for two reasons. One is,
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.360]  it's very easy to set up a paywall for a newsletter that works that, you know,
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.840]  you sign up once and you just get the email and you know,
[13:40.840 --> 13:44.240]  and yes, there's a website that you can log into and, you know,
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.240]  member for the service that I use and that, that Ben uses and, and Jason Snell
[13:49.240 --> 13:51.560]  uses and pretty and cocky uses.
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.200]  Like it's actually does a pretty good job at keeping you logged in. However,
[13:56.520 --> 13:58.720]  guess what? Everybody still reads their email.
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.240]  And if your goal is to be essential to someone's professional life,
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.480]  you better be in their email. So it's, you know, of course,
[14:08.480 --> 14:11.040]  there'll be a point where people are getting too much email and too many
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.040]  newsletters and I've probably unsubscribed from a few even from people I like,
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.280]  but right now it's working and and I love seeing sub stack and other services
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.480]  get, you know, get investment and become popular. It's, to me,
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.560]  it's a really interesting really great time as you, as you say.
[14:31.280 --> 14:35.240]  Yeah. And, and Snell's I don't think cocky charges for his newsletter,
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.240]  but like the six colors model that Jason Snell has carved out is sort of a
[14:39.240 --> 14:42.400]  hybrid model where there's a, you know,
[14:42.440 --> 14:47.440]  just a traditional blog with sponsors and you know,
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.040]  content daily and links and original articles and but also a members members
[14:55.080 --> 15:00.080]  only program that gets you something like a exclusive to the members paying
[15:00.280 --> 15:04.000]  members weekly newsletter, you know, and that hybrid model. I, I've,
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.360]  I've always, I probably don't try enough things.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.000]  I've probably in my as I teeter towards old age, I've, I've,
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.840]  I was more successful in the early days of daring fireball when I would just try
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.440]  stuff, you know, and I, I tried the membership thing way back, you know,
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.440]  like when I Dave went first went full time with daring fireball in 2006 and then
[15:23.200 --> 15:26.480]  I figured it had to be something I don't want to repeat myself cause I've spoken
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.480]  about this before, but my idea wasn't to have original exclusive content.
[15:31.480 --> 15:36.480]  It was that what I call link list entries,
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.800]  which is funny because it's like 90% of what I do now at daring fireball like
[15:41.800 --> 15:44.560]  that. That was the new thing. Like for the first two years,
[15:44.560 --> 15:47.640]  all I had were the full articles, like the columns, two or three a week.
[15:48.320 --> 15:48.920]  And then I thought, well,
[15:48.920 --> 15:51.280]  there's always a couple of little things I'd like to link to,
[15:51.320 --> 15:53.800]  but I don't want to write a full article about it. And then I thought, well,
[15:53.800 --> 15:58.800]  what I could do is I could charge people members and I could,
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.800]  I could charge people members and they'd get an exclusive RSS feed where that
[16:05.160 --> 16:10.160]  would have the links as I posted them and 24 hours after I posted each one,
[16:10.600 --> 16:14.480]  it would go up on the website for everybody to see free of charge.
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.000]  So if you wanted to follow, you know what I linked to as I wrote it,
[16:18.020 --> 16:21.520]  you'd have to have the RSS feed. That didn't really work out.
[16:21.520 --> 16:25.040]  And then I switched to, I thought just for technical reasons, basically,
[16:25.040 --> 16:30.040]  basically because Google reader didn't work with subscription only RSS feeds or
[16:30.200 --> 16:31.400]  private RSS feeds.
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.920]  And that's when I came up with the idea for sponsorship for the RSS feed,
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.360]  which is basically how I feed my family for the last,
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.080]  have I fed my family for the last 13 years? Yeah. But, uh,
[16:44.160 --> 16:45.800]  but anyway, I think that's great.
[16:45.800 --> 16:48.280]  And I talked about it last week on my show with Brent Simmons,
[16:48.560 --> 16:51.880]  where I think that the resurgence of newsletters,
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.720]  it goes hand in hand with a bit of the resurgence of interest in RSS readers.
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.920]  Um, because I, I think that there's just a,
[17:02.920 --> 17:07.920]  a pleasure in the reading experience where if I sign up for the new consumer,
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.960]  when a new issue comes into my email box, I see it,
[17:13.960 --> 17:17.360]  I know exactly what it's going to be and when I click on it or tap on it,
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.400]  depending on what device I am, I, there it is and it is nicely,
[17:21.400 --> 17:22.240]  it looks nice.
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.600]  It is ready for me to read and I can start scrolling and there's nothing,
[17:25.640 --> 17:30.640]  no popups come up telling me that there's a fricking cookie policy and I've got
[17:30.800 --> 17:33.000]  to say it, I'm okay with this.
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.880]  There's no a pop up that comes up covering the content telling me I have to log
[17:37.880 --> 17:41.800]  in again, like the goddamn wall street journal, which I pay a fortune for,
[17:42.280 --> 17:45.760]  right? Like it makes it reading stuff on the web with that's paid.
[17:45.880 --> 17:50.960]  It is so annoying. It really is. I, it is a wall street journal in particular.
[17:50.960 --> 17:55.720]  I mean, I don't know what the hell kind of cookie system they have,
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.440]  but I get logged out of the wall street journal all the time and I pay,
[17:59.640 --> 18:03.840]  it's like probably one of my most, if not the most expensive subscription I have.
[18:04.320 --> 18:08.080]  It's, it's ridiculous. Like you wouldn't put up with it in the real world.
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.920]  Like imagine if you paid, you know, whatever, you know,
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.200]  a couple of hundred bucks a year,
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.480]  which is I think what I pay for the wall street journal to be like a member of a
[18:16.480 --> 18:19.040]  club. And every time you show up at the,
[18:19.040 --> 18:22.080]  every other time you show up at the club, they're like, who are you? Yeah.
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.440]  And you have to like, you'd be like, show them your ID. You gotta like sign in.
[18:26.440 --> 18:28.640]  You got to type a password or something like that. Like you, you,
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.360]  you'd never tolerate it. Whereas like with RSS and RSS still isn't great for,
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.160]  in my opinion, and I don't think it ever will be forced for paywall stuff,
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.520]  for subscription for member only stuff. But that, like you said,
[18:40.520 --> 18:44.280]  that's why email and newsletters are fantastic, right? Like I,
[18:44.280 --> 18:46.800]  I've been subscribed to stetecory for years.
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.360]  I've never once had to reenter my credentials every time Ben
[18:51.360 --> 18:54.440]  publishes something, there it is in my email box, ready to read.
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.200]  And I think that that is a big part of this resurgence in,
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.040]  in email, the like oldest of old parts of the internet,
[19:05.040 --> 19:08.640]  which is, it's so fascinating to me, right?
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.520]  Like just the oldest thing on the internet that's still thriving and it's like
[19:12.520 --> 19:13.360]  still growing.
[19:13.360 --> 19:18.040]  Yeah. And honestly, you know, and I'm, I know I'm one of the rare people,
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.360]  I mean, you and I are among the rare people. Like I actually really,
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.440]  really care about the reader experience and you know, side note,
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.080]  it's driving me crazy how hard it is to,
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.560]  I have to mess with my MailChimp template and I just haven't done it yet, but,
[19:32.560 --> 19:37.000]  you know, even working at, and, and Vox media was great about this,
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.080]  like Rico, the verge, the sites in our, in our networks,
[19:40.080 --> 19:43.520]  like they also highly prioritize the reader,
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.240]  but you read half the sites nowadays and you have to find like
[19:48.240 --> 19:52.920]  three or four modal little tiny X's or click off these,
[19:53.400 --> 19:55.200]  these passive aggressive email,
[19:55.200 --> 19:58.960]  pop-up forms that are increasingly like, no,
[19:59.240 --> 20:02.360]  I don't want free stuff from you jerk, you know, that kind of stuff.
[20:02.400 --> 20:05.760]  It's like the X is like a 50% gray X on a,
[20:05.760 --> 20:10.480]  on a 25% gray box. It is like, I just,
[20:10.560 --> 20:13.080]  I don't want to live like that. So I, you know, it's,
[20:13.120 --> 20:17.000]  it's great to be able to have a, you know, a, a medium and a,
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.480]  and a site where you know, there are no popups, there's no,
[20:21.520 --> 20:25.880]  you don't have to click off anything. I, the typography is nice.
[20:25.880 --> 20:30.880]  It's from New Zealand. I picked it out specifically for you. And I don't know,
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.480]  it, it, to me it just feels great. So there's,
[20:33.480 --> 20:36.840]  there's no ads that are, that are, uh,
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.760]  creeping me out trying to sell me pants with me,
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.520]  with me trying to sell you a subscription with me,
[20:43.560 --> 20:47.960]  with me knowing that I just bought two pairs of pants two days ago on a website.
[20:47.960 --> 20:51.200]  And now every goddamn site I go to is trying to sell me pants. It's like,
[20:51.200 --> 20:55.640]  I just bought pants. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.760]  Anyway, anyway, newsletters. Yeah. It's been, anyway, it's been great.
[20:59.760 --> 21:03.680]  And I'll be writing about the iPhone next week. So, or I guess this week,
[21:03.680 --> 21:05.160]  whatever, whenever this drops. But,
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.840]  well, let me take a break. Let me take a break and, uh, uh,
[21:09.280 --> 21:11.960]  hit the money button and tell you about our first sponsor.
[21:11.960 --> 21:16.280]  It's a brand new sponsor. It's called clear bank, all one word,
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.360]  but they spelled bank with a C. So it's clear B, A,
[21:21.360 --> 21:26.360]  N, C clear bank is changing the way entrepreneurs raise money with equity free
[21:26.360 --> 21:30.280]  capital. Co-founder of Michelle Romanow,
[21:30.760 --> 21:34.680]  star of Canada's dragon den or dragon's den.
[21:34.720 --> 21:37.920]  That's the like the Canadian version of shark tank, uh,
[21:37.960 --> 21:40.040]  co-founded clear bank with our partner,
[21:40.040 --> 21:43.520]  Andrew D'Souza after seeing how many companies were willing to part with
[21:43.520 --> 21:46.160]  precious equity in exchange for a bigger marketing budget.
[21:46.400 --> 21:49.760]  Clear bank believes that founders shouldn't give up a piece of their company
[21:50.040 --> 21:52.280]  just to fund marketing and inventory expenses.
[21:52.280 --> 21:57.280]  They make equity free investments from $10,000 to 10 million and can get you a
[21:58.280 --> 22:01.840]  term sheet sheet in less than 20 minutes.
[22:02.400 --> 22:07.280]  They charge a small flat fee for the capital and you pay them back using a win,
[22:07.280 --> 22:10.880]  win revenue share. This is not alone. There is no interest rate,
[22:10.880 --> 22:15.040]  no fixed maturation, Nate, no personal guarantees,
[22:15.040 --> 22:17.400]  no credit checks and no financial covenants.
[22:17.400 --> 22:21.800]  Clear bank has relationships with marketing agencies, e-commerce professionals,
[22:21.800 --> 22:23.080]  venture capitalists, accountants,
[22:23.080 --> 22:26.840]  and more giving you a true unfair advantage in the market.
[22:27.160 --> 22:32.160]  They've invested over $150 million in 2018 and they're on track to invest over
[22:34.080 --> 22:35.800]  1 billion this year.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.080]  This is a company that has been around for a while with real money. Uh,
[22:40.080 --> 22:44.040]  some notable portfolio companies are public goods, Lisa sleep,
[22:44.120 --> 22:49.200]  Latote and Buffy to name just a few. Uh, so if you're doing over,
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.840]  if you, if you're a company and you're doing over $10,000 a month in revenue,
[22:53.600 --> 22:54.920]  they're, they want to talk to you.
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.080]  Find out how you can receive clear bank capital by getting your 20 minute term
[22:59.080 --> 23:03.120]  sheet at clear bank. That's again with a C for the bank,
[23:03.240 --> 23:06.640]  clear bank.com slash talk show,
[23:07.200 --> 23:07.920]  clear bank,
[23:07.960 --> 23:12.200]  stop pitching and get back to doing what you love growing your business.
[23:12.200 --> 23:15.920]  My thanks to them. First time sponsoring the talk show.
[23:15.920 --> 23:20.200]  Uh, what is, should we move on to,
[23:20.240 --> 23:24.720]  I guess we should cover this event before we run out of time. Yeah. Um,
[23:25.880 --> 23:28.440]  nothing important. Just the, you know, just the iPhone event. Yeah.
[23:29.120 --> 23:30.800]  Just the biggest event of the year. Yeah.
[23:31.480 --> 23:34.440]  I don't know what the biggest event of the, it's for me personally,
[23:34.440 --> 23:38.720]  it's probably WWDC, uh, cause I'm a little bit more on the software side.
[23:38.720 --> 23:43.560]  I do my live show, uh, which has turned into a big deal. Uh,
[23:43.560 --> 23:48.080]  um, for the greater world, clearly the,
[23:48.440 --> 23:48.920]  uh,
[23:48.920 --> 23:52.120]  the September iPhone event is the bigger deal because it's hardware and
[23:52.120 --> 23:54.720]  financially for Apple it is because that's still,
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.840]  that's still what the company is.
[23:57.680 --> 23:59.320]  And also kind of historically,
[23:59.320 --> 24:03.840]  or at least in the last decade where they've also kind of had the,
[24:04.120 --> 24:08.880]  uh, where they've showed off the big new stuff like the Apple watch and yeah.
[24:09.240 --> 24:11.360]  Yeah, true. Um,
[24:11.360 --> 24:14.440]  it's also a little interesting though because they hold it at the Steve jobs
[24:14.440 --> 24:17.440]  theater, which is bigger than, um,
[24:18.480 --> 24:22.640]  that for years they were, they'd hold the iPhone event at weird or not weird
[24:22.640 --> 24:25.360]  places, but, uh, just various,
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.280]  they couldn't hold it on Apple's campus because the old town hall is to wait
[24:29.280 --> 24:31.160]  way too small. Um,
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.280]  so they would hold it at places like the Bill Graham civic auditorium.
[24:34.480 --> 24:37.520]  I think the last few years, that's where they had it before, uh,
[24:37.880 --> 24:40.560]  before they could, before they opened the Steve jobs theater.
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.200]  Um, they used to hold it, um,
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.280]  at the Yerba Buena theater right there on the same block as Moscone,
[24:49.320 --> 24:52.440]  um, which was still, that was pretty tight. But even the Steve jobs theater,
[24:52.440 --> 24:55.680]  I forget how many people can fit in there, but it's not huge.
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.680]  Whereas the Bill Graham civic auditorium was Hugh mungus and WWDC's keynote is
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.400]  Hugh mungus, just an enormous cavernous space.
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.400]  So it is, it's interesting to me just at a meta level,
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.920]  how tight, you know, seating is and how a little bit there's,
[25:17.240 --> 25:20.000]  I know more people in the media who get invited, you know,
[25:20.080 --> 25:25.080]  can get a press invitation to the WWDC then the iPhone event just be,
[25:25.480 --> 25:27.440]  and it's simply a factor of how many,
[25:27.960 --> 25:31.520]  how many butts they can fit in the theater. Um, so anyway,
[25:31.520 --> 25:32.720]  what are we expecting next week?
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.200]  That's the other weird thing about the September event is that there's often
[25:36.200 --> 25:39.720]  not much of a surprise other than details. Um,
[25:40.120 --> 25:43.680]  like, and so it's weird cause I'm fascinated by the details,
[25:43.720 --> 25:47.320]  but, um, it's in the large sense, the press will all,
[25:47.320 --> 25:51.640]  it seems to always like the, the, the mainstream press will usually, um,
[25:52.600 --> 25:55.360]  just say, well, this is everything, you know, every three new iPhones,
[25:55.360 --> 25:56.920]  that's what we expected. No surprises.
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.000]  Right. And now, and gripe about pricing and, uh,
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.800]  something else. But I think the, we're going to start with the iPhones. I mean,
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.840]  um, it seems like we pretty much know what we're going to get, right?
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.600]  Uh, yeah, I think, yeah, pretty much. Uh, it sounds, you know,
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.040]  and I think, I think it's unavoidable given the leakiness of the, uh,
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.800]  the supply chain basically. And we've known this for a month or we think,
[26:26.800 --> 26:30.240]  we've known it, let's, you know, put it whenever we speak with certainty of
[26:30.240 --> 26:35.640]  what we know, let's just put an asterisk that says we're 98% sure that we're
[26:35.640 --> 26:38.000]  just going to get successors to what we got last year.
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.120]  So there'll be a new phone. That's like the 10 are a new phone,
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.640]  like the 10 S and a new phone,
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.040]  like the 10 S max with the eight 13 chip and that the,
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.000]  the two 10 S successors are going to have three camera systems on the back,
[26:52.320 --> 26:54.640]  which is the big physical change instead of two cameras.
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.120]  So it'll be a big square back there instead of a Tylenol capsule.
[26:59.120 --> 27:01.920]  Shape thing. Um,
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.040]  and new colors apparently, supposedly maybe, uh,
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.000]  I've heard, I don't know if there's, I don't know.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  I forget if this leaked or not,
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  or if I only heard this through the fence that there might that the, the,
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.840]  the 10 S models, which I think are going to be called pro iPhone 11 pro.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.600]  I don't know, but that,
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.400]  that the iPhone 11 pro will be offered in a new color, uh, like a blue,
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.760]  I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what I heard.
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.080]  So it'd be, so it'd be the white with the silver trim, the black,
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.200]  of course, can't, can't not have black, gold and blue.
[27:37.440 --> 27:43.440]  I don't know if that's true or not. Uh, new 10 also correspond to a blue watch.
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.000]  I wonder, and we could talk about the watch later cause I wonder, you know,
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.480]  there's, you know, we'll talk about this,
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.720]  but that there's rumors that they're going to have titanium ceramic in addition
[27:52.720 --> 27:56.440]  to stainless steel and, and aluminum. Uh,
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.720]  and I wonder, I mean, aluminum to me would be the easiest to tint.
[27:59.880 --> 28:03.320]  I don't know that. I don't know if I guess they could do titanium in any color
[28:03.320 --> 28:05.800]  they want ceramic, I guess they could do and I ceramic,
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.120]  I guess you could do any color under the sun because you're not even coding it.
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.960]  Like you'd just make the ceramic in the material. But anyway,
[28:12.960 --> 28:14.080]  let's talk about watches later.
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.320]  The big thing that I'm most interested in is the three camera system for the pro
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.160]  models. Um,
[28:20.320 --> 28:24.920]  and the idea is that in addition to the two lenses we have now,
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.200]  like the regular lens and the two X quote unquote, telephoto lens,
[28:29.200 --> 28:30.560]  which isn't really telephoto,
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.600]  but I get why Apple calls it telephoto cause it's zoomed in at its natural
[28:34.600 --> 28:35.440]  resolution.
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.520]  That there'll be the third camera that they're adding will be a wide angle lens
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.120]  that's significantly wider than the standard lens.
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.440]  So there'll be the new one, you know, there'll still be the default one,
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.600]  which is what everybody, which is kind of a wide angle lens.
[28:50.600 --> 28:53.720]  I think it's like a 28 millimeter equivalent for 35 millimeter.
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.960]  Cameras. Um, the telephoto,
[28:58.960 --> 29:01.880]  which is the equivalent of a 50 and then a wider angle lens,
[29:01.880 --> 29:04.240]  which at least in terms of the rumors,
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.960]  nobody knows exactly how wide wider angle is. I,
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.760]  I think that's interesting cause I'm a camera enthusiast. Uh,
[29:13.440 --> 29:18.280]  the thing I'm most interested though is how the,
[29:18.280 --> 29:18.800]  and again,
[29:18.800 --> 29:23.160]  this is the sort of thing that at least so far hasn't leaked at all and tends
[29:23.160 --> 29:26.680]  not to because I think that it, the,
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.560]  the iOS 13 betas that go out to the public don't
[29:31.560 --> 29:34.000]  have the code that, you know,
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.840]  there it's a different fork within Apple from the version that has
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.320]  the code that supports the new hardware features on new hardware, right?
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.720]  So I'm most interested in what the camera team had has done
[29:48.720 --> 29:51.880]  software wise with that third camera because there,
[29:51.880 --> 29:56.360]  it's not just like a simple, uh,
[29:56.400 --> 29:59.920]  like the, on the phones that we already have with the two cameras,
[29:59.960 --> 30:00.920]  it's not just, well,
[30:00.920 --> 30:05.560]  you're either using the one lens or you're using the other and it just switches
[30:05.600 --> 30:10.240]  like, like as though it was like a hardware switch between the two lenses. Um,
[30:10.400 --> 30:14.240]  the software does some very interesting stuff. You know,
[30:14.240 --> 30:18.120]  it's like the fact that you can start a video with the one X lens and it'll
[30:18.120 --> 30:21.120]  switch to the two X lens if you zoom while you're shooting.
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.640]  And yet the video doesn't have like a skip where it looks like you've suddenly
[30:25.640 --> 30:27.600]  flipped lenses. Um,
[30:28.520 --> 30:33.000]  the way that the portrait mode works and it uses the two X lens for the
[30:33.040 --> 30:33.880]  photo,
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.880]  but uses the one X lens to get the depth masks to help create that fake
[30:38.880 --> 30:43.200]  bokeh effect. Like I've strongly, I have no idea.
[30:43.280 --> 30:46.080]  I have no insight information on it, but I strongly suspect that they'll,
[30:46.120 --> 30:51.000]  they'll use this extra wide angle lens for similar stuff to make photos better
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.360]  even when you're not actually shooting the photo with that lens. I don't know.
[30:56.120 --> 30:57.880]  That could be really interesting. I mean, if you,
[30:57.880 --> 31:02.240]  if you look at where software has been, um,
[31:02.280 --> 31:05.920]  kind of the most fun and interesting in photography,
[31:05.920 --> 31:09.440]  it's certainly not in the stock camera apps these days.
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.120]  It's like the Instagram super zoom in stories and all the AR
[31:14.120 --> 31:18.320]  stuff that Snapchat and Instagram have been doing. So I wonder if, yeah,
[31:18.320 --> 31:23.320]  I always wonder how, how much Apple lets itself be inspired by stuff like
[31:23.560 --> 31:28.160]  that, that is kind of more fun than practical. Um, you know, if,
[31:28.160 --> 31:32.560]  if there's a, a super zoom type effect or, you know, even,
[31:32.560 --> 31:36.680]  even just a suite of special effects where, um, you know, you,
[31:36.880 --> 31:40.480]  it zooms in very quickly on someone, uh, you know,
[31:40.560 --> 31:43.360]  switching between the different cameras or something like that, that,
[31:43.440 --> 31:46.720]  that could be kind of fun. Um, I just, I don't, you know,
[31:46.720 --> 31:49.320]  and they've added some effects over the years. I just wonder how,
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.160]  how wacky they, uh, will let themselves get. But I'm,
[31:53.400 --> 31:55.080]  I'm also sure there's probably things that,
[31:55.120 --> 31:59.120]  that we can't just imagine here on the fly that when they show them off, um,
[31:59.320 --> 32:03.400]  will be interesting. And, um, you know,
[32:03.400 --> 32:06.120]  an impressive once you, once you've kind of get to play,
[32:06.360 --> 32:09.640]  once you've been developing with multiple cameras for that long,
[32:09.640 --> 32:13.280]  I imagine they've figured out some neat tricks that, uh, that could be cool.
[32:13.280 --> 32:18.080]  Yeah. Um, uh, otherwise though,
[32:18.080 --> 32:21.680]  I don't know, you know, what else, you know, with the phones, I mean,
[32:22.440 --> 32:23.560]  I can't wait to see it,
[32:23.600 --> 32:28.200]  but I don't know what else to conjecture about now, three days in advance.
[32:28.520 --> 32:32.040]  Yeah. I mean, the, the, the pro thing is kind of interesting, you know, how,
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.400]  is this going to be the,
[32:34.400 --> 32:38.360]  the venue to kind of talk about what it means to be a pro? Um,
[32:38.400 --> 32:41.720]  or is that just straight up a marketing term? And then, uh,
[32:41.720 --> 32:43.360]  part B of that is, is it,
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.960]  is it become the only pro item without a USB C port in the lineup?
[32:48.880 --> 32:51.320]  I think that, I think that one's been busted, right? It's,
[32:51.400 --> 32:52.880]  it's probably going to be lightning still.
[32:52.920 --> 32:55.200]  So, uh, yeah, that's a good question.
[32:55.240 --> 32:58.600]  That's actually a really good question. Cause I, and I say it's a good question.
[32:59.200 --> 33:02.000]  I know it's a good question because I actually have at least three different
[33:02.000 --> 33:04.160]  people have asked me that in the,
[33:04.240 --> 33:08.840]  on Twitter in the last 24 hours based on my daring fireball article,
[33:08.840 --> 33:13.520]  I was guessing that they're going to call it the iPhone 11 pro. Um,
[33:15.560 --> 33:18.120]  uh, so there's, I have two answers to that. One is,
[33:18.560 --> 33:22.200]  according to the rumor mill from the supply chain, it's,
[33:22.280 --> 33:23.480]  they're still all lightning.
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.040]  And that's the sort of thing that would very likely leak just because there's
[33:31.840 --> 33:34.720]  nothing Apple can do about it. Right. Because the actual, you know,
[33:34.720 --> 33:39.720]  I don't know how many of the phones are actually in North America already,
[33:39.720 --> 33:41.280]  but certainly some of them already are.
[33:41.520 --> 33:45.760]  And prototypes have certainly been in the hands of Apple employees for months
[33:45.760 --> 33:46.600]  now.
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.400]  And the review units that'll start getting seated next week I'm guessing are
[33:51.400 --> 33:53.840]  already here. I can't imagine that they would, you know,
[33:53.880 --> 33:57.680]  want to cut it so close that they're, but who knows? I don't know how that works,
[33:57.680 --> 34:00.880]  but if they're not here, they're on the way here. Um,
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.160]  because the review units typically start getting seated to people the day of the
[34:05.160 --> 34:08.800]  event. Um, it's, it's just, just,
[34:09.360 --> 34:11.080]  it's just no way to hide something like that.
[34:11.840 --> 34:14.160]  And then the, my other answer would be strategically.
[34:14.160 --> 34:16.280]  I think there's a very big difference.
[34:16.520 --> 34:21.520]  There is a correlation between the current pro devices and USB-C ports,
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.200]  but like on the Mac, it never really made sense to have a lightning port.
[34:26.200 --> 34:31.200]  So USB-C is just the next generation of USB. So I,
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.520]  I feel like the fact that all the Mac Mac pros and Mac book, well,
[34:35.520 --> 34:39.520]  I guess the Mac pro actually doesn't have USC USB-C yet because the Mac pro is
[34:39.520 --> 34:42.640]  from 10 years ago, the one that you can buy today.
[34:43.160 --> 34:46.000]  But like the iMac pro does and Mac book pro does,
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  and surely the new Mac pro that's coming out soon will have USB-C ports.
[34:51.480 --> 34:54.880]  I guess we even know that. I guess we've seen it already when it was previewed at
[34:54.880 --> 34:57.760]  WWDC. Um,
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.000]  the one that makes people who want to see the iPhone get a USB-C port hopeful is
[35:04.480 --> 35:09.240]  the iPad pro. That's the one. So the, when the iPad, you know,
[35:09.560 --> 35:11.840]  changed from iPad to iPad pro,
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.240]  the pro has USB-C instead of lightning and they continue to make other iPads
[35:18.600 --> 35:23.240]  that are just called iPad air or iPad mini and they still have lightning.
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.240]  And so I can see there's a certain logic to the notion that if Apple is going to
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.800]  start calling some iPhones pro and some are not pro that the pro ones would have
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.840]  USB-C and the other ones would not. So I get that.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.840]  But strategically I don't think there's,
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.400]  I don't think Apple has ever even considered switching the iPhone to USB-C.
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.800]  No, it's a fun exercise, but I can't imagine that would happen.
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.400]  There's the lightning ecosystem is just too big. And, um,
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.160]  and also like for the iPad pro,
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.160]  I think a lot of it was for the power delivery and the fast charging of
[36:00.440 --> 36:03.800]  something that, you know, has a giant battery in it. Whereas even in,
[36:03.840 --> 36:07.280]  even an iPhone pro I think is still going to have a normal,
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.920]  normal ish battery and probably even continue to have a smaller battery than
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.120]  the, whatever the XR becomes. So, um, yeah,
[36:16.440 --> 36:19.960]  I, it, uh, my money's on lightning. Yeah.
[36:19.960 --> 36:23.880]  And it would be even if the, even if the rumor mill were silent on it, I would,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.600]  I would say lightning. I'll say, and I'm going to say, so the rumor mill,
[36:27.600 --> 36:28.920]  it doesn't go that far ahead.
[36:29.320 --> 36:32.320]  I honestly still believe that the iPhone,
[36:32.360 --> 36:37.360]  every iPhone will have lightning from now through the end of time until they
[36:40.640 --> 36:45.080]  don't even have a port. As long as there's a port that you plug into, uh,
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.240]  it'll be lightning. I think. All right. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know.
[36:49.240 --> 36:52.120]  I don't know. I, or I'll at least say for the next five years, I don't know.
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.680]  Who knows what would happen five years from now. Um,
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.840]  the cool thing. Oh, people don't believe me. People don't, I say this,
[37:00.840 --> 37:04.040]  and I know some people are so skeptical and think that every corporation,
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.600]  no matter which one that you did, that they're foolish it with everything they
[37:08.600 --> 37:11.440]  say. But with Apple, a lot of the time,
[37:11.480 --> 37:16.040]  you really can take them at their word and their explanation when the iPad pro
[37:16.040 --> 37:19.560]  switched to USB C was that these,
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.600]  the iPad pro is meant as an alternative to a traditional laptop PC.
[37:27.480 --> 37:30.000]  And therefore it, they're sweet using,
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.800]  including USB C so that you can use PC peripherals.
[37:34.880 --> 37:36.280]  Um, that's what they said.
[37:36.880 --> 37:40.000]  They also mentioned specifically that it supports higher,
[37:40.020 --> 37:44.400]  faster charging rates and it comes with a, hmm, what,
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.040]  what is that iPad charger? I forget how many Watts.
[37:47.800 --> 37:48.640]  I think it's 18.
[37:48.960 --> 37:50.440]  It ships with an 18 watt,
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.080]  but it can take advantage of up to a 30 watt charger, uh,
[37:55.280 --> 37:56.520]  to charge even faster.
[37:56.520 --> 37:59.480]  So if you spend more money or the smarter thing,
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.200]  go to somebody like anchor and buy a third party 30 watt charger,
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.240]  uh, you could charge your iPad pro faster. Uh, and those things are tiny.
[38:09.240 --> 38:13.880]  They're amazing. Tiny anchors in particular are really, really tiny.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.720]  Um, uh,
[38:17.960 --> 38:20.160]  that's what they said. And I think that's what they mean. Well,
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.120]  I don't think the iPhone will be able to take advantage of 30 watt charging.
[38:24.280 --> 38:25.760]  I mean, it's, it'd be interesting.
[38:25.760 --> 38:28.840]  And I guess that's one small thing that we can conjecture is, is will Apple,
[38:28.840 --> 38:31.080]  finally ship it with more than a five watt charger?
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.360]  I guess last year is still shipped with five watt chargers. And I know,
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.280]  I know the nerds out there that, you know,
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.680]  I know a lot of you who are listening to my show or in that think that that's
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.240]  outrageous, but there really is a, a flip side to it,
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.160]  which is that a lot of people like that chart,
[38:49.200 --> 38:52.400]  the charger that they ship with iPhones because it's so small and because
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.120]  therefore it fits anywhere where there is a plug, it will fit.
[38:56.280 --> 38:59.080]  And it fits in a woman's purse,
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.000]  even if it's a very small perverse so they can carry a charger with them
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.920]  everywhere they go. And there's, there really are.
[39:04.920 --> 39:08.080]  And I've talked to people at Apple about this and I know people think it's
[39:08.080 --> 39:10.040]  because Tim Cook is,
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.480]  is a tight wad and wants to squeeze an extra $5 out of every
[39:14.920 --> 39:17.640]  iPhone sold by shipping a cheaper charger.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.320]  But there really are millions and millions and millions of iPhone users who
[39:22.320 --> 39:27.320]  prefer the little square five watt charger because it's because it's small and
[39:27.520 --> 39:30.880]  they don't care if it's slower. And I know people don't,
[39:31.480 --> 39:34.560]  people who listen to the show don't believe me, but I know that that's true.
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.280]  So hopefully what they'll do is ship it with a higher capacity charger.
[39:38.280 --> 39:39.560]  That's relatively small.
[39:40.480 --> 39:41.960]  Yeah. If they could get, you know,
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.040]  a faster or whatever you want to call it,
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.840]  a higher capacity charge in that same exact size or keep it five WAP and make
[39:48.840 --> 39:53.400]  it even smaller. I'm not sure how possible that is either. But, um,
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.560]  I don't think it's funny. Uh, you know, I was just spent, uh,
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.320]  four months overseas and the chargers are so big there because the wall sockets
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.400]  or something like that. But anyway, um, yeah,
[40:05.560 --> 40:07.400]  the UK ones look like some kind of,
[40:07.840 --> 40:10.920]  like there's something out of a Terry Gilliam film.
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.200]  Like it's meant to meant to look silly. It's crazy. I mean,
[40:15.320 --> 40:19.200]  you can't put that in your pocket, but, um, yeah, the, uh, although the,
[40:19.200 --> 40:22.880]  the ones in France were, were bigger, but they were kind of skinny.
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.160]  It was kind of a good, a good shape. But, um, yeah, I, here's the thing.
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.680]  The other thing is I think that Apple probably knows this too,
[40:30.680 --> 40:35.200]  that probably 90% of charging occurs, you know, at a,
[40:36.280 --> 40:39.240]  at nighttime while people are, are sleeping.
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.080]  So the speed of the charge is probably less important than what,
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.400]  what's obviously a bigger problem is when you're almost out of battery and you
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.200]  need a quick charge. Um, and that's where both of these things,
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.240]  both the five, five watt and also the wireless charging,
[40:55.240 --> 40:58.640]  which is increasingly common. Neither of those things really help with that.
[40:58.640 --> 41:01.000]  Yeah. They don't help in that. Oops. Holy crap.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.040]  I forgot to charge my phone or like every once in a while,
[41:04.440 --> 41:09.440]  like I have the bedside wireless charging thing, but it's,
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.440]  you know, and the one I have, I forget, I think it's the Mophie. Um,
[41:14.200 --> 41:19.320]  you know, it's okay. It, the sweet spot isn't too small, but it, you know,
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.240]  once every two months or so I'll have a night where I didn't quite hit it and
[41:23.240 --> 41:26.680]  I'll wake up in the morning and my phone didn't charge at all. Uh,
[41:26.680 --> 41:29.800]  it would be nice. Now usually with the way I live my life working here,
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.080]  it doesn't really matter. But if I had to leave the house every day for,
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.360]  you know, a commute or something like that, it would be nice.
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.520]  It's nice every once in a while when you really,
[41:38.520 --> 41:43.520]  when your phone's already under 20% to charge it to at least like 80% pretty
[41:43.760 --> 41:47.560]  quickly. So fast charging definitely has a use and it would be nice if it came
[41:47.560 --> 41:51.360]  in the box. Yeah, I love it with the, um, with the 30 watt, uh,
[41:51.400 --> 41:56.160]  anchor charger and then the USB C to lightning. Uh, especially if I, you know,
[41:56.160 --> 41:58.120]  if I check into a hotel or something and I just,
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.160]  I need to give me as much charge as I can get in 10 minutes before I have to
[42:02.160 --> 42:05.320]  leave. Uh, it's great for that. The thing that, uh,
[42:05.320 --> 42:10.240]  that I'm intrigued by is this rumor of wireless reverse charging, um,
[42:10.280 --> 42:15.280]  where you can theoretically charge your AirPods off of the back of the new
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.640]  iPhone, whether it's G or, or, you know,
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.120]  G plus Apple magic. Yeah. Like, will there be other things that,
[42:24.120 --> 42:28.040]  that you can ask also put on the back of your phone that would charge,
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.200]  like could you bum a charge off someone else's phone on your phone? Well,
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.800]  the Samsung ones that have this similar feature,
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.520]  or at least conceptually the same feature,
[42:38.560 --> 42:41.280]  definitely let you charge another phone because they even,
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.120]  and they even advertise it as like a, you know, like their,
[42:44.160 --> 42:47.440]  their TV ads show people like, you know, uh,
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.840]  guy meets a girl in a coffee shop and you know,
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.680]  introduces himself by letting her charge her phone on his phone. Um,
[42:55.040 --> 42:57.960]  cool. I don't think I, from what I've heard,
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.440]  I don't think Apple's is going to do that.
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.640]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's AirPods only. And I don't think,
[43:02.680 --> 43:05.640]  I don't think they could do the watch because the watch needs like the magnetic
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.000]  connection. Whereas the AirPods you could just put side by side, but who knows?
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.600]  Maybe they will. I don't know. I mean,
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.320]  did the watch ever get,
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.040]  did the watch ever ship with whatever it needed to charge off of the power mat,
[43:19.040 --> 43:22.960]  the, what was that thing called? The air pad or air power, air power.
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.200]  I supposedly air power was just going to work with all existing watches.
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.040]  I remember when, when it was still a product,
[43:30.040 --> 43:32.200]  I remember asking and it wasn't going to be like, Oh yeah,
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.160]  it will only work with the new watch. It's supposedly it would work with any
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.280]  watch. So maybe that would work. I don't know. Although the watch, my,
[43:39.640 --> 43:42.360]  my problem is never the watch running out of battery. It's the,
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.680]  it's only the phone really. So yeah, same with AirPods really. I don't, I,
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.040]  I, I can't remember the last time I even heard the bloop bloop,
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.720]  that little sad sound. You know, no, especially the new ones. Yeah.
[43:55.840 --> 43:58.680]  So I don't know. To me it's a neat feature, but it's not a big feature.
[43:59.400 --> 44:02.400]  I'll tell you one thing I'm looking forward to on the new phone supposedly.
[44:02.960 --> 44:06.800]  And again, you know, it doesn't, it's only like words that have leaked. It's,
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.560]  nobody seems to have pictures yet. I mean, who knows?
[44:09.560 --> 44:10.800]  The last weekend is always,
[44:10.800 --> 44:13.920]  it's always dangerous recording on a Friday before the event.
[44:13.920 --> 44:17.800]  And I suppose it's like I want to get it out so people travel and stuff like
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.920]  that. I could listen to it, but it's always surprising what might leak on Sunday.
[44:22.560 --> 44:25.200]  But one of the things people have said, sources have said,
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.920]  is that the glass back of the new phones might have a matte finish at least in
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.400]  certain colors. That would be very appealing to me. I, my,
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.840]  my least favorite thing about these phones over the last three years really,
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.280]  cause I would leave and include the jet black iPhone eight that I,
[44:43.440 --> 44:47.880]  that I carried for a year is the way that you can't tell which side is which by
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.680]  touch. Like I think I said on a recent episode of the show,
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.600]  my one regret over the years of buying iPhones is that I didn't get the matte
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.360]  black iPhone eight instead of the jet black because I think I would have,
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.120]  I think I liked the aesthetic better overall in the long term.
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.520]  I think I was just infatuated by the glossy jet black at first,
[45:06.520 --> 45:08.880]  the Darth Vader ish sort of finish.
[45:08.880 --> 45:10.680]  But I, I, I, I just,
[45:10.680 --> 45:14.120]  I really disliked the way that when you're, and like I tell, you know,
[45:14.120 --> 45:17.720]  I, I always try to put the phone in my pocket the same way,
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.680]  glass facing my thigh as opposed to the screen out just in case something,
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.120]  you know, hits me in the thigh, hopefully it will crack the back,
[45:25.120 --> 45:28.800]  not the front. But you know, every once in a while you,
[45:28.800 --> 45:31.040]  your phone is flipped around or it's on the,
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.280]  on the table or something like that. I don't know. It's just, to me,
[45:35.280 --> 45:36.120]  it's just generally,
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.960]  and it also to me makes it more slippery.
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.600]  I would presume that a matte glass finish for the back would,
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.160]  would be have a little bit, you know, literally have more texture.
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.160]  So I hope that's true on,
[45:50.200 --> 45:53.920]  on the lightning versus USB-C front before we move on even further.
[45:53.920 --> 45:58.920]  The other thing that I just, I cannot emphasize enough is among our crowd,
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.960]  people who listen to this show, people who read this site, people who,
[46:02.960 --> 46:07.160]  people who really know, understand the difference, like know what USB-C is.
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.440]  They want USB-C on the iPhone because they really are. And I see it,
[46:13.440 --> 46:13.960]  I get it.
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.360]  They're enamored with the idea that they could carry fewer cables around.
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.000]  Wouldn't it be neat if you could just, you could, even if you,
[46:22.160 --> 46:26.600]  you travel with an iPad and in a phone and a Mac book,
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.160]  if all you needed were USB-C cables and maybe you could just use the same
[46:31.160 --> 46:33.480]  charger, just charge your phone overnight,
[46:33.520 --> 46:37.680]  then leave your iPad pro plugged in in your hotel room during the day and plug
[46:37.680 --> 46:39.680]  the Mac book in when you need it. You know, that's great.
[46:39.680 --> 46:41.120]  I see the appeal of that, right?
[46:41.120 --> 46:44.280]  That would really simplify the world in a,
[46:44.320 --> 46:48.840]  in a way that you could just have it and maybe you're a nerd and you carry,
[46:49.320 --> 46:52.680]  you try out Android phones throughout the year or two. You know,
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.880]  the more devices you use, the more that appeals to you as a nerd,
[46:55.880 --> 47:01.760]  that appeals to you as a nerd. But normal people hated when Apple switched
[47:01.920 --> 47:06.320]  from the 30 pin to lightning. They hated it, hated it.
[47:06.320 --> 47:09.240]  And everybody chalked it up to, or not, you know,
[47:09.240 --> 47:13.760]  everybody in the normal world chalked it up to Apple did this to get everybody
[47:13.760 --> 47:17.680]  to buy the $30 lightning cables that they,
[47:17.760 --> 47:21.320]  it was a money grab. And if they switched to USB-C,
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.240]  even though in the nerd world, they would say they would,
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.760]  they would praise Apple for switching to the industry
[47:28.760 --> 47:29.600]  standard,
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.200]  the hundreds of millions of regular iPhone users out there who
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.320]  don't, you know,
[47:37.680 --> 47:40.640]  already have lightning cables around their house and everywhere they need for
[47:40.640 --> 47:44.560]  their phone would see it as a money grab that Apple's trying to get,
[47:44.560 --> 47:48.640]  even though you, we know you can buy USB-C cables from anywhere, anybody,
[47:49.200 --> 47:51.920]  they would chalk this up to, you know, they would complain about it.
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.600]  But I can't tell you how many people in my family bitch to me when Apple
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.760]  switched to lightning. And I would say,
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.440]  don't you see how much more elegant it is that 30 pin cable was gross and ugly.
[48:02.880 --> 48:06.160]  It was so bad, but they didn't see it that way.
[48:06.160 --> 48:09.600]  All they saw it was that the cables they already owned and that the stands they
[48:09.600 --> 48:13.880]  already had or whatever didn't work with our new phone and they had to throw them
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.040]  out. Or like people who like
[48:18.040 --> 48:20.040]  a, uh, uh,
[48:20.280 --> 48:24.840]  like a married couple where somebody gets the new iPhone one year and the other
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.840]  spouse has the old iPhone. Now they need two cables.
[48:29.640 --> 48:33.880]  People hate that. I cannot, the number of people who would hate,
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.520]  hate a change to USB-C on a new iPhone
[48:39.720 --> 48:43.600]  vastly, I would say 10 times outweighs the number of people who would,
[48:43.800 --> 48:44.960]  who would be happy about it.
[48:44.960 --> 48:47.920]  And I realized that there's people,
[48:48.760 --> 48:51.440]  nerds who are listening to me say this and they're, they're,
[48:51.520 --> 48:53.640]  they're getting angry at me cause they don't believe it.
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.440]  But I'm telling you in the real world, it's true. Yeah. Change is hard, man.
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.280]  Although I did pick up one of those 30 pin cords this week and I'm glad we're
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.360]  not using those right now. It's,
[49:04.400 --> 49:09.080]  it's sort of ludicrous looking when you really think about it. It's really,
[49:09.080 --> 49:12.440]  they really were. I mean, it was, it seemed like a breakthrough at the time,
[49:12.440 --> 49:15.960]  but yeah, at the time compared to a scuzzy pin or something like that, but,
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.320]  but there were, and they were like sharp clips in there to keep it,
[49:22.640 --> 49:27.240]  keep it in. Yeah. Anything else on the iPhones that we expect next week?
[49:27.520 --> 49:30.800]  No, I just, every time the iPhone naming comes up, I just,
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.880]  I always think back to the iPhone math and laugh my ass off. Remember that one?
[49:35.520 --> 49:39.120]  It's like a terrible supply chain rumor that there was going to be an iPhone
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.320]  called the iPhone math. Yes. I haven't thought about that in years,
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.040]  which I think about all the time.
[49:46.040 --> 49:49.120]  And I think it ended up being the plus maybe or something like that.
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.280]  So maybe someone saw a plus sign or the word plus and maybe I never thought of
[49:53.280 --> 49:57.040]  that. Right, right. Yeah, I love it. Yeah.
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.440]  Maybe this will be the year that iPhone math.
[50:02.480 --> 50:05.720]  You know what? That actually is a very logical explanation that they saw the
[50:05.720 --> 50:12.360]  plus sign and it's some kind of mistranslation from Chinese to English,
[50:12.520 --> 50:17.560]  turned it into math because it was plus. Maybe. I don't know.
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.200]  I love it though. I want something like that again.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.520]  I don't want, I will not devolve into politics, but it, it,
[50:26.520 --> 50:27.600]  there's somebody on Twitter, you know,
[50:27.600 --> 50:30.640]  with this thing with Trump being obsessed with the, his,
[50:30.640 --> 50:35.640]  his statement five days ago that Alabama was in the path of the hurricane, uh,
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.800]  Dorian. Yeah. Uh,
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.320]  and that he spent the last five days defending it and trying to make up the,
[50:42.320 --> 50:42.560]  that's right.
[50:42.560 --> 50:46.560]  Somebody on Twitter conjectured that what happened was that the thing that he
[50:46.560 --> 50:50.800]  saw said, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and all Bahamas,
[50:51.560 --> 50:55.280]  and then he saw all Bahamas and read it as Alabama.
[50:56.120 --> 50:57.920]  And I think that's so possible.
[50:57.920 --> 51:02.280]  I think that is so possibly where this whole thing came from and that's why he's
[51:02.280 --> 51:05.920]  convinced that he really, that's awesome. He's really told that,
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.720]  really was told that Alabama was, was in the path of the hurricane. I love it.
[51:09.800 --> 51:14.920]  All Bahamas. Amazing. Uh,
[51:16.040 --> 51:18.880]  yeah, I don't have anything else on the iPhone. I'm interested. I, you know,
[51:18.920 --> 51:23.880]  I think mostly it'll be, uh, you know, do you, uh,
[51:23.880 --> 51:28.560]  do you think that they'll change the upgrade program at all either to,
[51:29.280 --> 51:29.320]  uh,
[51:29.320 --> 51:34.320]  include it in some of the bundles that they're doing and or make it exclusive
[51:35.160 --> 51:37.400]  for the, uh, Apple card?
[51:37.440 --> 51:41.200]  Or do you think that they'll just kind of stick with it? In other words,
[51:41.200 --> 51:45.360]  would they do some kind of like, for lack of a better word,
[51:45.400 --> 51:47.920]  Apple prime, let's just say,
[51:48.120 --> 51:51.280]  I don't think they would call it that because Al, uh, Amazon so owns it,
[51:51.280 --> 51:54.440]  but for lack of, to avoid trying to think of a better name,
[51:54.440 --> 51:55.680]  let's just call it Apple prime.
[51:55.720 --> 51:59.240]  There's a whole bunch of daring fireball readers and talk show listeners have
[51:59.240 --> 52:03.840]  emailed me. So with this idea, you sign up, you pay Apple,
[52:04.600 --> 52:09.320]  I don't know, uh, X hundred dollars a year and you get all of it,
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.120]  you get all of their subscription stuff, the TV plus and the, uh,
[52:14.520 --> 52:16.400]  the news, you get Apple music,
[52:16.400 --> 52:21.400]  you get Apple arcade and you get into some kind of, uh,
[52:21.640 --> 52:25.120]  upgrade program for the iPhone, you know, which, and they have that already.
[52:25.120 --> 52:26.640]  There is the upgrade program. Right.
[52:26.680 --> 52:29.720]  And that's what I was curious about specifically that upgrade program.
[52:29.760 --> 52:32.800]  But the other, the other bundle too, I mean, that's,
[52:33.080 --> 52:36.480]  that's a good question as well. I wonder, I like,
[52:36.480 --> 52:39.600]  I see the appeal of it where, and I, there's definitely, you know,
[52:39.600 --> 52:40.960]  in terms of people who've emailed me,
[52:40.960 --> 52:43.880]  there's definitely people out there who are interested in it. And I know,
[52:43.880 --> 52:46.760]  I know firsthand from friends that, uh, a lot of friends,
[52:46.760 --> 52:50.920]  I have used the upgrade program to get a new phone every year. Um,
[52:51.720 --> 52:54.920]  I mean, there's three strategies if you want a new phone every year, which I,
[52:54.920 --> 52:58.960]  and number one, you're, you're an odd ball if you want a new iPhone every year,
[52:58.960 --> 53:03.600]  because normal people buy them and keep them now for longer and longer terms
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.720]  than ever because they're, they're still so useful longer than ever.
[53:08.320 --> 53:12.920]  Um, but I buy one every year I do. Um, and I'm,
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.880]  I do the dumbest thing possible,
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.840]  which is I keep all of my old ones so that I can just say that I have them all,
[53:19.040 --> 53:23.520]  uh, which is financially ridiculously stupid.
[53:24.160 --> 53:28.160]  Um, the other thing that I know a lot of people do is they,
[53:28.560 --> 53:32.440]  if they buy a new phone every year, they just buy it, pay for it upfront.
[53:32.520 --> 53:35.080]  And then when the new one comes out, they sell the old one.
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.640]  And typically if it's in good condition or very good condition,
[53:38.640 --> 53:42.400]  it still has an awful lot of value. Like a year old iPhone,
[53:42.400 --> 53:46.080]  10 S probably that might've sold for around a thousand dollars. You could,
[53:46.120 --> 53:49.800]  you might be able to sell for 600, 500, $600. Um,
[53:50.320 --> 53:55.320]  and so you're not paying a thousand dollars a year to get a new iPhone top of
[53:55.640 --> 53:59.960]  the line. You're only paying like five, four or $500 a year. And then,
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.200]  but I do know a lot of people who use the upgrade program and I don't even know
[54:03.200 --> 54:05.040]  how that works because I want to keep my old ones,
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.920]  but could they combine it with media subscriptions? I honestly don't even know.
[54:09.920 --> 54:11.040]  I don't know if they would want to,
[54:11.040 --> 54:15.080]  I don't know if they don't want to cross streams on hardware sales and
[54:16.080 --> 54:19.160]  subscriptions. Clearly. I mean,
[54:19.160 --> 54:22.720]  one of the things they didn't mention at the media event in March was at any
[54:22.720 --> 54:24.120]  kind of, they didn't even mention
[54:25.680 --> 54:28.200]  the idea of a bundle. Let you know,
[54:28.240 --> 54:30.560]  leaving aside that they didn't tell us how much a lot of this,
[54:30.560 --> 54:33.160]  these things would cost. They didn't tell us what arcades going to cost.
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.000]  They didn't mention what TV plus is going to cost. Uh,
[54:39.120 --> 54:43.320]  clearly they should have a bundle right for just for the subscriptions alone.
[54:43.360 --> 54:47.360]  Could they have a level of the bundle that includes the upgrade? They could.
[54:47.400 --> 54:48.640]  And I think it would appeal to some people,
[54:48.640 --> 54:51.240]  but I don't know if they would want to cross streams on that. I don't know how.
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.720]  And if that's like some kind of accounting problem, I don't know.
[54:56.680 --> 54:59.040]  What do you think? And apple card only.
[54:59.240 --> 55:01.720]  That's another thing that people are conjecturing. I don't know.
[55:01.720 --> 55:06.040]  Um, yeah, I think, uh, probably not this year for that.
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.000]  Although it's interesting how much they've been advertising the apple card and
[55:11.960 --> 55:16.280]  uh, I saw it on, on baseball game yesterday. I've seen Twitter ads for it. Uh,
[55:16.320 --> 55:19.360]  they're really going, I haven't seen it on a game yet,
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.920]  but maybe that's because I only watched you watch on the MLB TV or yeah,
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.600]  that's where I was watching. Well, maybe I'll start seeing them soon. I don't know.
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.200]  Um, yeah, I mean, I, I,
[55:31.560 --> 55:35.240]  I assume they they're doing this to make it a truly mainstream thing.
[55:35.240 --> 55:37.000]  And it really has the possibility,
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.480]  if you think about it to become like the single most popular credit card in
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.360]  America, just by virtue of how fragmented that market is. Um, but anyway, uh,
[55:45.600 --> 55:46.520]  the bundle thing, I mean,
[55:46.520 --> 55:49.120]  that was definitely one of the things that I thought about when we were sitting
[55:49.120 --> 55:51.720]  there in March was, wow, they, a,
[55:51.720 --> 55:56.040]  they haven't given the prices for a bunch of these things. And B, you know,
[55:56.040 --> 55:57.240]  uh,
[55:57.280 --> 56:01.120]  is everyone just going to have to pick and choose which one of these things they
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.200]  get or they're going to do a big bundle? Um,
[56:05.120 --> 56:09.960]  I think that the products are kind of different enough that
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.040]  a bundle doesn't really make a ton of sense. Um,
[56:14.880 --> 56:15.120]  you know,
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.240]  the person who wants arcade games and the person who wants magazine content is
[56:19.240 --> 56:21.640]  probably not the same person. Um,
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.480]  maybe that is a reason to make them like to, to incentivize them with,
[56:26.520 --> 56:27.360]  with a discount.
[56:27.880 --> 56:31.320]  Like music has the broadest appeal, right? I mean,
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.520]  cause I don't know what percentage of people who own Apple
[56:36.560 --> 56:38.680]  products like listening to music,
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.600]  but surely it's as high as almost anything you could say people subscribe to,
[56:44.040 --> 56:47.520]  right? I, I, I don't know. It just seems like music is,
[56:47.680 --> 56:49.000]  it's like a universal thing.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.040]  Right. And so right. Well,
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.960]  so will Apple music and Apple TV plus get some sort of bundle
[56:56.040 --> 56:59.960]  opportunity? Maybe, maybe the answer is no,
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.120]  we make things easy enough to sign up for that. You know, we don't,
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.080]  we don't need whatever mechanics come with the bundle to, to make,
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.880]  to make it work. Um, but you know, there,
[57:13.880 --> 57:16.280]  there's also this bigger idea of an, you know,
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.800]  an overall like Apple plus or whatever you would call it. Yeah. Not,
[57:19.880 --> 57:23.320]  obviously I agree with you. They're not going to use the word prime. Um,
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.080]  but something that gets you all this stuff and you know, that's the question,
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.200]  you know, and, and the new iPhone every year. I don't, I don't know. Um,
[57:32.640 --> 57:35.480]  we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Uh, the other, the,
[57:35.520 --> 57:38.440]  the other one that stands out is the, and I don't want to go too long on it,
[57:38.440 --> 57:40.400]  but cause we'll find out, I think Tuesday,
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.440]  I do think that the services stuff is going to be a big part of the, the,
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.800]  the event is the one that people are conjecturing about is the fact that TV
[57:47.800 --> 57:51.840]  plus, which is Apple's original content, just how are they going to, you know,
[57:52.160 --> 57:54.480]  how could they sell it for $10 a month?
[57:54.520 --> 57:59.360]  If Disney is selling a thing for $8 a month that has the entire Disney library
[57:59.360 --> 58:02.520]  and Apple says, here, you will charge you $10 a month. And we've got,
[58:02.640 --> 58:07.360]  we're starting with five shows. I get that. Uh,
[58:07.800 --> 58:12.640]  and no content library either. Uh, right, right. With no content library,
[58:12.640 --> 58:16.360]  right. Which is like, you know, the, well, Disney owns a,
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.840]  a massive content library. Netflix, by this time,
[58:21.120 --> 58:24.560]  Netflix has so much original content with comedy specials and original shows
[58:24.560 --> 58:29.480]  that they do. They own a big content library and they pay to get stuff.
[58:29.520 --> 58:32.200]  You know, they had friends for a long time, et cetera, et cetera,
[58:32.200 --> 58:33.040]  all sorts of stuff.
[58:33.440 --> 58:38.320]  And HBO has all these movies and stuff that aren't original to them.
[58:38.320 --> 58:40.200]  Apple plot TV plus isn't going to have that.
[58:40.200 --> 58:44.840]  I feel like there's gotta be something more to TV plus in terms of how Apple is
[58:44.840 --> 58:49.680]  going to sell it than just $10 a month and you get our shows and that's
[58:49.680 --> 58:52.520]  it. They could do that, I guess, and just say we're,
[58:52.560 --> 58:55.840]  that's how confident we are and that these shows are good,
[58:55.880 --> 58:58.200]  that we're charging this premium compared to everybody else.
[58:58.200 --> 58:59.880]  But I think there's more to it.
[58:59.880 --> 59:04.480]  And TV plus to me is the one that really seems like it could go a long
[59:04.480 --> 59:08.960]  way by them just saying, Hey, if you're an Apple music subscriber,
[59:08.960 --> 59:13.200]  you get TV plus you've already got it. Just, you don't have to do anything.
[59:13.200 --> 59:15.120]  If you know these, these shows,
[59:15.120 --> 59:18.280]  the morning show with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell,
[59:18.280 --> 59:20.160]  it's coming out, it's debuting in October.
[59:20.360 --> 59:22.560]  And if you're an Apple music subscriber, you've already got it.
[59:23.920 --> 59:26.120]  I don't know if that's what they're going to do. And I know, you know,
[59:26.520 --> 59:30.840]  and just use it as a way to drive Apple music subscriptions. Right.
[59:31.640 --> 59:34.000]  I don't know. There's gotta be something more to it with that.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.560]  And I think there has to be some kind of,
[59:35.560 --> 59:38.920]  right. They can't just, I mean, they can do whatever they want,
[59:38.920 --> 59:42.040]  but it's a hard sell to say, Hey, it's 10 bucks a month.
[59:42.080 --> 59:45.400]  And we have these three shows for you to watch. And sorry,
[59:45.400 --> 59:47.800]  we just lost two of them too. Yeah.
[59:50.800 --> 59:54.720]  Yeah. It'll be interesting. I think that's one of the,
[59:54.800 --> 59:56.840]  I think that's one of the parts that we know the least about.
[59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.960]  Right. There was a rumor though that the Apple arcade is only going to be,
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.720]  and you know, this was uncovered by a key Rambo,
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.520]  the hacker extraordinaire who writes at nine to five Mac and somehow got
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.000]  pre-release access to the,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.880]  to the internal version of Apple arcade that's being tested by Apple employees.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.120]  And once he got his hands on that, poked around the API APIs.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.280]  And it's by poking at those API APIs and getting responses, he, you know,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.480]  at least at the time he was poking around,
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.840]  it seemed like it was going to cost $4.99 a month to subscribe.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.360]  And I think everybody was thinking it every, you know, that they said, Hey,
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.360]  Apple news is 10 bucks a month. And everybody and,
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.440]  and they, they tend to, everybody tends to think, and, you know,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.440]  for good reason that Apple, you know,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.640]  whatever you think Apple is going to charge for something, double it.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.040]  And maybe that's right. But sometimes they surprise us.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.480]  Remember the original iPad, everybody thought was going to be $999.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.240]  And everybody thought, yeah, that sounds about right.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.080]  The charge a thousand dollars for this amazing tablet. And then it debuted at,
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.960]  you know, started at $4.99. It was half the price, you know?
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.120]  So sometimes they surprise us.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.680]  I think the idea that Apple arcade might only be $5 a month would,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.320]  and the response I saw to that,
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.640]  like on Twitter and from readers was, wow, that's great.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.280]  I was on the fence about it, but if it's only $5 a month, count me in, you know?
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.360]  So I don't know. It's, it's, I wouldn't be surprised if, if the overall, Hey,
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.480]  even if you want to subscribe to everything,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.320]  it's not going to cost as much as you're worried.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.160]  They're not going to charge you $50 a month for all of it.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.400]  Yeah. That would, that would be a huge splash. I mean,
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.440]  I think that would definitely take the steam out of a lot of the games that are
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.920]  not in there. So that could be interesting. Yeah. And then one,
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.920]  I always wonder too about is iCloud,
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960]  which continues to stay the same price, but not get more compelling.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.040]  Yeah. I got, I hope they, I don't know. I think they would have said it at WWDC,
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.560]  but boy, I don't know. I would love,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.560]  I just would love to see them get make it more of a no brainer for people to
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.960]  upgrade their iCloud storage so that they can upgrade, you know,
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.680]  back up their devices and have the massive photo library backed up in the cloud
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.800]  without, without concern. But anyway, we'll see.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.560]  I wonder if that, cause you still can't back up a Mac to iCloud, right?
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.280]  I wonder if that's, I wonder if that's like next, next year's Mac OS and iCloud
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.600]  update. I don't know. Who knows?
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.080]  Apple watch. I, everybody for good reason, presumes we'll see series five,
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.920]  Apple watches.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.840]  One of the rumors is that a new feature is going to be sleep tracking,
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.000]  but it's not clear to me whether the sleep tracking is going to be for the new
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.040]  series five watch or if it's going to be in the OS and available to,
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.840]  to people who already own watches. You can already,
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.080]  there are a bunch of good sleep tracking features that are available to you.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.040]  Already. There are a bunch of good sleep tracking apps that use the Apple watch.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:48.960]  You know,
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.800]  it's just not built into the system software that comes with the watch,
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.960]  but there's all sorts of good third party watches or watch apps for sleep
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.320]  tracking,
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.280]  which I've been using for a couple of months now since I talked about it on the
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.040]  show with Merlin, man. So we'll see how that goes.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.120]  But the bigger news I guess is on the hardware front that the idea that there's
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.200]  going to be titanium and ceramic options for the watch.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.040]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.320]  I used the, uh, after your, after your show,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.200]  I used the sleep tracker once and uh, it told me my sleep sucked,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.880]  so I stopped using it.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.480]  I think that's probably why you're supposed to use it though, right? I guess.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.480]  I don't know. I started using it. I don't want to go too far in it,
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.120]  but it was a couple months ago and Merlin man was on the show and I was under
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.920]  the weather. I had some kind of bug and I was sleeping really poorly. Um,
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.600]  now I'm back to normal, but it is in there.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.360]  I do sleep now that I have the tracker.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.360]  I find that I sleep differently than I expected.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.560]  I sleep a little bit less than I've always thought I did,
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.360]  but also it varies day by day. Like if,
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.520]  so if I get less sleep than usual, if I only sleep seven hours, uh,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.160]  I often sleep like 10 hours the next night if I can. But on average,
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.400]  it's about nine hours a night.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.680]  Yeah, that's nice. That's good man. Yeah. Uh,
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.280]  indie publisher lifestyle. Yeah. Titanium ceramic.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.440]  They already had the ceramic edition watches from a couple of years ago and
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.680]  then there weren't any last year. Now the rumor is they're coming back, uh,
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  along with titanium. Titanium is a very interesting material for a watch.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.360]  I know some people are skeptical about it because way back what in 2002 or
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.560]  whenever, when the titanium G four power books came out,
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.880]  the titanium flaked after usage especially like didn't do very well on the palm
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.960]  rest part with some people's, you know, the secretions from your hands.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.520]  I think Apple's material engineering has come a very long way since then.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.800]  And just knowing what I know about the watch world,
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.800]  titanium is an excellent material for watches and watch grade titanium.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.120]  They could color it and it wouldn't be as something that would flake off.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.320]  It would be baked into the material. Uh,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.120]  and that the big difference between one of the big difference between titanium
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.880]  and stainless steel is that titanium is significantly lighter.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.240]  Um, so I don't know. It'd be interesting to see.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.520]  I'm curious how they're going to fall price point wise,
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.920]  presumably titanium and ceramic,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.880]  especially ceramic would both be more expensive than the stainless steel ones.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.920]  We shall see. Yeah, I think,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.560]  I think it's smart what they're doing with the, uh,
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.360]  my guess is the case design probably doesn't change this year. Uh,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.360]  I don't think so because it changed subtly with series four last year and it got
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.320]  a little closer to the wrist and they increased the size of the display to go
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.200]  edge to edge. But for the most part, like when you pass somebody on the street,
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.880]  I, I can't tell if it's a series four or series three, two,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.280]  one, it's, you know, at an arms distance, it's,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.600]  it's just the iconic Apple watch round wreck shape.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.920]  So I don't think it would change again. Yeah, probably not. I mean,
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.760]  I mean, it's, you know, obviously, uh, you could always,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.440]  you always want it to be thinner, but it's totally fine. And, um,
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.360]  my guess is that, so if the,
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.640]  if the differences are mostly cosmetic or the material to the,
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.040]  does the processor get faster and that sort of stuff change too, you think? Yeah.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.400]  Oh yeah. I, I think battery life. Yeah. I definitely,
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.440]  I think that team and there's so much headroom to gain. Like I,
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.960]  every single year eventually, you know, like, uh,
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.240]  like I don't expect the new iPhones to be significantly faster than last year's
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.440]  iPhones. Like the iPhone, a series chips have,
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.560]  you know, I, you know, it'd be like 10, 13%.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.600]  Somebody had a leaked benchmark that, uh,
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.880]  from geek bench that was supposedly maybe the new 10 R. Um,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.000]  and it was like 13% faster or something like that. And, uh, and I'm multi,
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.840]  multi-threaded. It was about the same. Um, it's, it's just,
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.800]  you run, you know, you can't keep making them 50% faster every year.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.040]  You run into the, you know, the laws of physics,
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.840]  but the watch processors are getting faster and faster every year.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.600]  So I'm sure it will be faster and have longer battery life, et cetera.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.960]  What about the rumor of, uh, a tile tracking dingus,
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.320]  something like a little,
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.520]  there's this rumor that they're going to come out with some kind of little
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.080]  things that you could like put one in your wallet and then you can find your
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.360]  wallet from the, find my whatever app.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.360]  I love it. Um, because, and actually when they announced the,
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.080]  the new find my Mac thing that used that kind of,
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.680]  uh, like the point to point mesh network.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.440]  So that even when your Mac is offline, yeah. Um, my, I immediate,
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.480]  my mind immediately jumped to that rumor of the tile thing and went, Oh,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.760]  is that how they're going to get the tile to, you know,
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.040]  to work when it's theoretically offline?
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.320]  I can't imagine it would have an LTE connection to it. So, yeah. Um,
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.400]  I have tile trackers. I got them for Christmas a few years ago.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.480]  I never really used them. I keep one in my backpack and so I can find, you know,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.840]  but I don't, I've never lost my backpack. They, they, to me,
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.400]  they weren't quite small enough and it wasn't quite convenient enough. Um,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.400]  so I didn't put one on my keys or anything. Uh,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.160]  this last words, I don't really lose stuff. So I,
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.400]  but I have a dog who's small and likes to escape.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.080]  So I'm really excited for him to have one of these. Um,
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.480]  that would be a cool, that would be a cool use case. I'd never,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.440]  I didn't even think about that. You know what I lose?
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.720]  I lose things that I can't possibly put a tracker on like, uh, my pen.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.360]  Yeah. And I'm, um,
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.840]  um, it's like one of the ways that I am slightly obsessive is I, I,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.720]  I swear by these pens, uh,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.760]  zebra Sarasa gel pens. They cost like three bucks each.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.240]  They're very nice gel pens, but they're like three bucks each. But I,
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.600]  and I, you know, and I have a drawer full of them here. I've already got,
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.640]  I have dozens of them,
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.880]  but I like to get one and use it for a long time, like years in,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.160]  and I'll just replace the ink cartridge. And if I lose my current pen,
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.840]  rather than do what I should do is just go get a new one out of the drawer. Uh,
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.040]  I'll spend an hour searching the house for it cause I want to know where it is.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.920]  Where is it? Uh,
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:27.560]  but anyway,
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.760]  I'm still interested what Apple's angle on this because it seems like such an
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.760]  odd thing for Apple to get into that.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.160]  Uh, I would think the only reason they would do it is if it's really compelling.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.920]  So it reminds me of the, the double a battery charger. It's like, you know what,
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.760]  these things are out there, but we think we can do them 10 times better.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.000]  And it fits into the software, which by the way, we'll keep people, you know,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.400]  if, if it, if it works once it's paid for itself, right.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.920]  And if, you know,
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.560]  if you've got 12 things tagged in your house, uh,
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.800]  then I guess you're sticking with the iPhone and not,
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.440]  and not going to a, to a Google pixel or something like that.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.920]  And you know, and then Scott too, you know, it's conceivably,
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.280]  it has to be some kind of thing where it,
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.640]  it wouldn't just tell you like, if I do find my iPhone, like where the hell's my
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.040]  phone, um,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.600]  it doesn't tell me where it is in my house.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.200]  It doesn't say it's in your bedroom dummy. It just says, Hey, it's in your house.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.080]  Right? Like presumably with these tags, it, you know,
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.360]  if you're going to find your keys, it's not good enough to tell you it's in your
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.960]  house. It has to, it has to help you find it, you know,
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.280]  in your couch cushions or wherever it actually is.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.120]  So I don't know how that'll work, but that's where,
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.760]  so there's the AR mode that supposedly leaked. And if like,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.080]  maybe you can look and it'll show up in your couch cushion.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.400]  That would be like in a killer demo if they could do that. Right. Yeah.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.240]  That seems like a cool thing. So in other words,
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.400]  you go to the find my app and you say, find my keys. And then it says like,
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.200]  just hold this up and it switches to an AR mode and it points an
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.400]  arrow towards your kitchen. And you're like, Oh yeah,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.160]  I left them on the kitchen counter. Of course. I remember now I put them down.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.920]  When I was putting, uh, you know, cream in my coffee or whatever. Um,
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.200]  that would be really cool. And it would definitely be, I can,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.120]  and Apple is so almost inexplicably all in
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.160]  on AR that you can definitely see them demoing the hell out of it on stage.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.320]  Yeah. Yeah. And again, you know,
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.200]  this is the kind of thing where they could probably sell them at a super high
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:32.760]  margin.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.000]  You'll probably end up accidentally spending a few hundred dollars on them over
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  the course of a couple of years keeps you locked into the ecosystem.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.400]  It keeps you using the find my app. And, um, you know,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.640]  it's not like they're, it's not like you're,
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.720]  it's not like that money was going to go anywhere else on their stuff.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.000]  You're not going to buy them instead of buying an iPad. Yeah. Um,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.440]  and it's cool, so why not do it? Yeah.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.560]  And one of the things that I think Apple doesn't get enough credit for is their
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.960]  industry leading prowess at making really, really small gadgets.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.800]  Um, I know Serenity Caldwell before she left and joined Apple wrote about it
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.160]  extensively, like on an annual basis is,
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.800]  is why don't other smartwatch makers make watches that are meant to fit on
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.440]  women's smaller wrists? Um,
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.080]  and I don't think it's because they don't want, they don't care about the market.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.480]  I think that Apple is so much better at making tiny,
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.880]  small risk computers that really only Apple is able to make them at the
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.440]  38 millimeter size and still have reasonable battery life and all the same
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:41.080]  functionality and performance. Air pods are tiny and I know there's other
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.040]  competing ones now,
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.200]  but there's a reason that Apple came out with the first really great tiny,
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.360]  not connected to each other by a wire under your chin or behind your neck.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.120]  Wireless air, ear, ear pods is that they're really,
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.280]  really good at making tiny little computers that could fit in something the
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.160]  size of an air pod.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.480]  So I think Apple's tile could be remarkably small and very,
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.880]  very effective. Um, because I think they're really, really good at that.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.160]  Which is why I haven't used the tile I got for free. It's just too big.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.600]  Right? Yeah. That's what I thought too.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.520]  It was too big for too many cases and it would have,
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.440]  I carry so few keys typically that it would have been like the,
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.400]  it would have been bigger than the rest of everything else I carry. Yeah.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.320]  Yeah. Uh, here's a question I got on Twitter right before we started recording.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.320]  I think it's fascinating per the event itself.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.240]  Will Johnny I've be in attendance?
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.920]  I think, yeah, he still works there. So I think so too.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.680]  Uh, I think he'll be there for years to come actually. I think. Ah, interesting.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.120]  Uh, but it's a good question and I, I would, uh,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.520]  I would read into it if he weren't there and it would,
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.520]  my interpretation, and I don't know how we'll know if he's there. I mean,
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.360]  cause it's, you know, it's not like he's going to be on stage,
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.520]  but typically, you know,
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.680]  I don't know how often he shows up like on the feed just when they show the
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.000]  audience and stuff like that.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.640]  Um, in the front row he shows up in the, no, he's usually in the second row.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.720]  Oh really? Oh yeah. Better than me. Yeah. Cause I've had,
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.120]  I've sat up close a couple of times. Um, I don't, I don't,
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.880]  I'm not going to say always, but cause I don't know. I don't,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.720]  I don't necessarily sit where I can see him every time, but at least every time
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.520]  I have seen him, he's, um, he's in the second row usually.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.040]  But the one thing that's very consistent is for like the last 10 years,
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.920]  every single time I've seen him in an Apple event,
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.680]  he is seated right next to, uh, Laureen Powell.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.240]  Oh yes.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.800]  Um, Steve jobs, his wife, um, uh,
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.160]  every time I have, uh, and the only time I can't, I,
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.160]  the only time I would say that I didn't see him seated next to her is because I
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.680]  didn't, I wasn't close enough to tell.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.680]  And I, interesting. I think they're friends. Oh, they're,
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.000]  I think they're dear friends. I really do.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  I think that's why he sits next to her. I think, and I, I,
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.320]  I think that they are genuinely close, very, very close. Um,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.360]  and for the same reason that she keeps attending events is the same reason I
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.120]  think Johnny I've might still keep attending events is because in some sense
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.640]  whether he works there or not, there's,
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.200]  there's so almost like a familial, uh, um,
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.600]  relationship. You know,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.560]  I see Bertrand surlay at the events still year after year. I'm again,
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.880]  I don't know if he goes to everyone,
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.720]  but I've seen him at them frequently and he hasn't worked at Apple since I
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.960]  don't know, 2006. Uh, there are a lot, you know,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.560]  people who leave on good terms, uh, you know,
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.320]  Scott forestall doesn't show up at the events,
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.040]  but people who leave on their own terms, uh,
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.600]  often keep coming back, you know, just because it's,
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.840]  it's just part of the culture of being at Apple that they really, the people who,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.440]  the executives who are there, they, they really do love these events.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.280]  So I, I, my guess is he will, and I would read into it if he wasn't,
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.320]  do you think he'll keep bringing his pals who fly in from overseas and all that
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.720]  kind of stuff? Yeah, probably.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.800]  He could probably bring as many people as he wants a bunch of the random guys I
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.320]  follow from Tokyo are our frequent guests of, of Johnny.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.320]  I've at the, uh, at the Apple event. It's always funny. Uh, Hey,
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.120]  let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. Uh,
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:25.640]  one of my favorite products. Uh, hello, H U L L O.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.640]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow?
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.600]  They're totally different than the fluffy soft pillows. Most of us are used to.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.280]  It's very similar to a bean bag and it allows you to adjust its shape and
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.280]  thickness. You might think that's weird. A bean bag as a pillow.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.800]  It is totally different. It's so much heavier cause it's like a bean bag. Uh,
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.160]  but it really works. It supports your head and neck.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.880]  How you want to unlike a traditional squishy soft pillow,
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.520]  they stay cool and dry compared to pillows filled with feathers or foam.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.640]  And most pillows absorb and retain body heat and moisture making your pillow
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.520]  feel warm and humid. Buckwheat tends to breathe better.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.040]  No more waking up in middle of the night just to flip your pillow to the other
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.280]  side to get the cool side. Hello, pillows. Stay cool.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.840]  On the same side. Uh, they've sent me a couple, uh,
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.000]  we use them all the time. I've said this before,
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:19.920]  my wife and son in particular love there so much that when we travel and we stay
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.480]  in a hotel for a week or something like that, like the number one thing,
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.560]  one of the first things they love about getting home is that they love going
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.800]  back to their hello pillows. Um, people love it. You can go to the website,
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.640]  check out the reviews written by their customers. Uh, it solves all sorts of
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.720]  problems. The key, the cool thing, uh, the I, you know,
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.400]  the using two pillows or folding a pillow to get your,
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.040]  to get your the support you want. Uh,
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:47.840]  one hello pillow is enough that you could prop it up the way you want.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.480]  You can lay it flatter, smooth it out. You can prop it up. It's,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.080]  it's really interesting and you can even just simply open it up.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.040]  It's a simple zippered opening. You can add more if you want it puffier.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.680]  You can take some out if you want it flatter. It's very,
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.080]  very simple to adjust that way.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.920]  People have been sleeping on buckwheat pillows for centuries.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.920]  It's a much bigger deal in Asia, particularly in Japan.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.720]  It's just in the West where it's sort of a novelty and it's just a very natural
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.000]  way to sleep. They're made right here in the USA with quality construction and
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.480]  materials.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.520]  They're certified organic cotton case is cut and sewn for durability and the
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.440]  buckwheat is grown and milled in the United States.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.400]  You get to sleep on it for 60 nights and if it's not for you,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.560]  you can send it back and they will give you a full refund. You can't lose.

[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.480]  Uh, how about longterm iPhone rumors,
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:09.760]  touch IDs coming back supposedly within an in-screen sensor in addition to face
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.400]  ID and a new, what do you think about that?
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.680]  It's a little weird to me and I'm a face ID believer.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.440]  And one of the rumors this year about the new phones is that the face ID system
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.120]  is going to improve such that it's going to have a much wider angle and
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.160]  particular to solve the problem of,
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.440]  of waking up your phone when it's face up flat on a table.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.480]  And it's funny because when that leaked a couple of weeks ago,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:40.160]  it was literally the day after, uh,
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.760]  my family had gone to eat at a restaurant and my wife was complaining,
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.400]  complained in particular about that because at the restaurant she had her phone
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.920]  on the table and she even said,
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.640]  the one thing I hate about this is that I can't look at my phone just, you know,
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.360]  the way I could with the old one with, you know,
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.440]  by putting my finger on it when it's on the table. Um,
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.640]  so it'd be cool if they solve that by having a wider angle. Um,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.800]  but other than, you know, making face ID work even better,
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.880]  I can't see why I would want touch ID again.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.000]  Some people when it's linked to this the other day said that the one thing they
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.480]  still hate about face ID is using it with Apple pay that they hate the
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.120]  double click the side button and they feel that's awkward and feel that that's
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:28.440]  the one thing that was better with touch ID that you just put your finger on the
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.000]  phone and get it near the NFC reader and beep you're in. Um,
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.520]  yeah, I don't know what to make of it. I don't know.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.200]  I wonder if there's more to it than just what we have
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.800]  historically used touch ID and face ID for.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.320]  Um, if it, you know, it could be part of a, um,
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.640]  a more sophisticated authentication scheme for two factor or something like
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.080]  that, or I don't know, something, I mean, nothing seems weird. I mean,
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.200]  I guess if you're, if you're daisy chaining those two technologies together,
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.040]  like there's just more zero percent. Yeah, totally.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.520]  But on the other hand, it's also more set up, right?
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.040]  Because now when you get a new phone or you restore your phone from the factory
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.640]  settings or whatever, now you've got two things to set up, right?
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.640]  And I've done it enough.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.400]  Like I've just reset an old iPad to run the beta on and it's like touch ID even
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.960]  with like iOS 13 still,
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.840]  it takes significantly longer to set up than face ID.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.400]  Like the face ID is remarkably quick where you just move your head in a circle
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.720]  and then they're like, do it again. And they're like, okay, you're good.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.880]  And it's like, really? That was it? Like touch ID. It's like your touch, touch,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.720]  touch, and then they're like, change your grip. And it's like, okay, touch,
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:43.280]  touch, touch. And you're in, I'm not going to say it was touch ID takes too long,
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.760]  but everything you have to do, you know,
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.720]  there's enough stuff going on in that you have, you've,
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.840]  you're setting up a new iPhone first run experience that adding another one
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.560]  seems like, I don't know, not that great.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.200]  And is the extra security worth that much? I don't know.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.320]  I like you said, I think there, if this is, there's truth to this and the rumors,
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.080]  you know, the Gurman rumor puts it at maybe for next year's phones,
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.360]  but maybe not until 2021. And then there was some other analyst,
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.120]  who I just linked to last night, who, who put out a report back in May,
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.520]  pretty much saying the same two things Gurman reported yesterday,
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.240]  which is that a touch ID is coming back possibly in a sensor that would work on
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.920]  the whole screen. So you wouldn't even have to put it on like a circle at the
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.000]  bottom. You could just put your finger anywhere on the screen. And this
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.280]  other rumor that there's going to be a new SE,
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.400]  a small, cheap, smaller, cheaper iPhone coming in March,
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.800]  like the SE did back in 2016.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.960]  I mean, maybe if this is part of like, okay,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:55.000]  they get rid of the notch and the selfie camera is so small that
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.080]  that a lot of the other stuff that they put in there to do face ID no longer
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.240]  fits. And that, you know, the camera itself
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.000]  is less secure than the old infrared camera,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  but it when it matches up with touch ID is secure. I don't know.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.640]  Now I'm just making stuff up, but it, it,
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.360]  there's gotta be something more to it. I think. Yeah, I, I sort of do too.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.440]  But it's interesting. I don't know. And you know, is there anybody, you know,
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.080]  like in the real world, now that we're two years into the face ID era you know,
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.520]  at least two years as of next week,
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:39.240]  it'll be two years since the iPhone 10 was announced. And you know,
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.760]  everybody, you know, like when touch ID first came out and it's good that people
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.960]  tested it, you know, but people figured out that, you know, there's,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.040]  there's technically a way that if somebody made a perfect print of your finger
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.000]  and, you know, did like a little mission impossible thing to put a,
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.440]  a, a Silicon fake copy of your fingerprint, they could get into your touch ID.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:04.200]  And people did testing two years ago where they'd find identical twins and see
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.360]  if they could get into their face ID.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.240]  And I remember there was a story where some teenage boy could unlock his moms.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:11.480]  You know,
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.560]  he looked enough like his own mother that he could unlock her phone with his
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.680]  face. You know, an Apple warned that, you know,
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.600]  it's twins are definitely a problem. Siblings might, you know,
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.760]  like if you have two teenagers, you know,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.200]  like a 12 year old and a 14 year old and they're both, you know,
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.080]  the same gender, they might, they might be able to unlock each other's phones.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:37.240]  But overall Apple touted the fact that it was face ID is way more,
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.440]  it's like significant. I forget the exact numbers Phil Schuler said on stage,
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.720]  but it wasn't like a little bit more secure.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.680]  It was like one in 50,000 people could unlock a touch ID device.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.120]  And it was like one in a million for face ID, presumably if they use,
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.520]  if they use both, it would be 50,000 times a million.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.480]  I don't know.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.080]  The thing I, the thing I worry more about, and we saw this week, what,
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.880]  what it, what can happen is the SIM card swapping
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.920]  with Jack Dorsey and this, I don't,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.360]  I'm not sure if you've been SIM swapped yet, but no, I was this summer.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.880]  And let me tell you, it's not fun. Really? Tell me how that happened.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.920]  Um, well,
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.840]  I was living in Paris for a few months and still have my U S phone and
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.120]  woke up and I had just read an article about a guy who had,
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.560]  uh, who had been SIM swapped and
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.080]  got a hundred thousand dollars of Bitcoin stolen from him. Oh man.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.600]  So I was already, I was already paranoid about it.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.280]  That's like losing cash because it's not, you know, there's,
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.120]  you can't go and get a refund or whatever. Exactly.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.440]  And so I was already worried about it. I don't have any Bitcoin. So, you know,
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.360]  uh, but it's still, it still was not fun. Um,
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  and I had written a post about crypto.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.840]  So I wonder if that's how someone, I don't know, I'm,
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.200]  I'm even reluctant to even talk much about it, but, uh,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.560]  and I haven't tweeted about it or anything,
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.400]  but I'll talk a little bit about it here because it happened. Um, anyway,
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.480]  I woke up one morning already paranoid about this SIM swapping stuff.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.160]  And, um, you know,
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.040]  I had to get up at six for a flight and I noticed that my network connection had
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.960]  been turned off, which was weird. Um,
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:31.920]  and I had gotten a text overnight from my carrier saying, uh,
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.120]  your, your SIM card has been changed.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.360]  Let us know if this isn't you or something like that.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.200]  And I was like, Oh shit, I don't have time for this right now.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.760]  I have to go to the airport.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.000]  Okay. Um,
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.960]  so I immediately grabbed my wife's phone and called my carrier and said,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.360]  you idiots. Um, and it's, I'm so frustrated. Cause I,
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.440]  I proactively reached out to them and said, Hey,
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.320]  I'm really worried about this.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.800]  Will you make sure that my account is locked down? And they're like, yeah, sure.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.240]  No, no worries. No worries. And they still did it. Uh,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.240]  it still got hacked and they haven't conclusively told me why.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.760]  Um, you know, they're there. If you look at most of these things, it's,
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.880]  it's someone in goes into a store and you know,
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:24.360]  my hunch is that it's someone who works at a store is, you know,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.240]  gets a list from a friend of 10 accounts that they want turned over or
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.720]  something like that. And it may not even be an owned and operated store.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.200]  It might be one of those third party stores, which seem even sketchier. Um,
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.320]  but they've got access to like, they've got access to the ability. Like if,
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.040]  if it's a store with a carrier, I, I you're,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.880]  let's not name any particular carrier, I guess, but yeah. Carrier X, if,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.280]  if they, you can get a carrier X SIM card there that the,
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.840]  just the retail clerk can like go in there and type a phone number and print a
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.560]  new SIM card and say, okay, that number is now on this card.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.920]  I think so. Um, you know,
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.960]  and they're supposed to ask all sorts of questions and verify it,
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.280]  but they could just, you know, they don't really have to ID all that stuff.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.120]  And that's what I didn't. That's what I'd love to know.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.360]  Like did someone make a fake ID with my name on it or do they just have a friend
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.880]  who works at one of those stores, you know, wherever and said, Hey,
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.000]  let's swap these 10 numbers. Um,
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.520]  did they look me up because I had written about Bitcoin or totally random?
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  I don't know. Um, or was, you know,
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.720]  was I in one of the,
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.280]  did they have a password of mine from a previous, um,
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.400]  hack of some sort of, you know, whatever system I had, I don't know,
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.000]  and I'm not sure if there's even a way to find out, uh, for any of them.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.680]  But at any rate, um,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400]  I got my number back within, you know,
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.720]  five minutes of calling them and it had only been compromised for a few hours,
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.600]  but were you able to get it back on the card you already had in your phone?
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.560]  Yes. So you didn't have to like go, you didn't give me your empower.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.280]  So you can't go to a U S carrier. So wow. That's exactly,
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.440]  that's pretty smooth that it worked that well for you.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.160]  It worked pretty well. However, I then, and I made my flight,
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.760]  um, but then I spent the rest of the week in an absolute,
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.280]  just state of paranoia, right? At my, at my bars every five minutes, like, Oh,
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.840]  did I lose signal again? Did I lose signal? Um,
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.480]  and weren't you also, weren't you also worried like,
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:24.800]  which I have any of my accounts been compromised because maybe they were using
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.760]  the phone number as the second factor or something like that. Bingo. And in fact,
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.560]  the first thing they had done is try to, uh,
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.760]  get into my two factor account. Um, because that you can look up
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.200]  the texts that your number has received. Um,
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.840]  and one of them was from, uh, the two factor service I use.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.800]  And so they were able to at least see the accounts that I have two factor four,
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.840]  but they didn't know my password for that.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.760]  So they didn't actually get to decrypt them. Um, but my,
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.560]  my guess is that they were looking for Coinbase or something like that. And I,
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:05.480]  I, uh, you know, I don't have any Bitcoin,
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.040]  so don't don't rob me. Don't even try. There's nothing there. I promise.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.920]  Um, but it was crazy.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.760]  But what I did do then is a full security audit and, um,
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.040]  and there's some really great guides on,
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.040]  I think the one I found was on medium of like ways that you can really
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.720]  lock down your, your accounts. Um, you know,
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.960]  including like taking your phone number off of your Google account and stuff
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.680]  like that. Um, and doing clever things with Google voice. So I'm,
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.800]  you know, I, it,
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.320]  it sucked and it was more an emotional thing than anything else. Like I,
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.920]  I did get to see that, you know, the texts,
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.960]  I didn't get to see the content of the text messages they received,
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.440]  but I knew, I knew that there weren't a lot and that they were not, you know,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.600]  none of my actual accounts had been compromised and I'm thankful for that.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.680]  But, and I, I'm, I, this has happened to like a dozen,
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.440]  the people I know this summer and it's crazy.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.960]  It's just an epidemic and I don't think the carriers are doing enough about it.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.160]  No, it's really just so, and it's such an important part of your ID.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:16.320]  And there's so many places default to using your cell phone as your second
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.880]  factor. Uh,
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.600]  I'm often a very lazy about such things and I was late to do two factor on
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.520]  lots of things. But, um, I, over the last two years, I've,
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:31.280]  I've cleaned up my act a lot. And one of the things, um,
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:36.080]  my friend Mac, Jay Seglowski, the guy who, the pinboard guy, uh,
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.080]  is really re so smart about it and he's really good at explaining it. And he's,
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:45.200]  he's spent a lot of time talking to, um, uh,
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.520]  people running for Congress.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.440]  Like he ran a thing that I supported last year called the great slate,
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.880]  which is trying to get Democrats elected in Republican districts, you know,
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.480]  around like 10, 10 great candidates around the country. Um,
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.400]  and in addition to like fundraising and trying to help them and stuff,
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:06.400]  he had like a whole guide to what campaign should do for information security,
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.960]  you know, and, and one of the big things is don't use your,
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.440]  don't put your cell phone number on your Google account. Um,
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.920]  do use Gmail.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.120]  The Gmail is very secure and Google has very good security stuff,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.720]  but don't even give them, don't even give Google your phone number.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:28.000]  Use something else like Google authenticator, which has third party options,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.920]  but then you get these one time codes and stuff because your SIM card is just
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.880]  cannot be defended. It really is dangerous.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.880]  And the same thing that you just said, like using,
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.240]  if you do have to use a phone number, use a Google voice number,
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:43.520]  which you can use and you can get text messages too.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.440]  And then it's all that your Google voice number is as protected as your Google
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.440]  account and there's no SIM card that they can hack to change the number or
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.600]  something like that. So they could,
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.360]  they can't take over your Google voice number unless they take over your Google
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.760]  account and they can't, you know, all sorts of stuff. Anyway, scary times.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.720]  Make it hard, make it complicated. And yeah, it, I mean, again,
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.440]  lucky that nothing, you know, was compromised, um, that I,
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.240]  that I know of, but, um, it was,
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.600]  there were three or four days there where that's basically all I was thinking
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.560]  about. So everyone be careful.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.440]  Yeah. Uh,
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.680]  Oh, why I started talking about this,
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:27.640]  I wish that was something that Apple could do something about the phone.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.120]  And that's why I had high hopes for eSIM. Although, you know,
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:32.720]  when you think about it,
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.680]  eSIM doesn't actually make it that much harder for them to actually,
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.240]  because the SIMs are still assigned by the carriers. Yeah. Um, but man,
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:46.200]  it's been what a year now and eSIM really doesn't seem like much has happened
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.360]  with it. Um, you know, especially this summer,
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:53.360]  I was traveling a lot and you know, the carriers that had it, they would,
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.120]  they were, they would have it for one of their types of accounts,
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:59.680]  but not others. A lot of times they wouldn't support it for prepaid.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.680]  So it's not like you could go into a Vodafone shop in London and get a eSIM
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.600]  second line as your prepaid account there. Um, it,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.400]  I wonder if they'll talk about eSIM at all for the, for the iPhone,
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.640]  but I really wish actually the,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.600]  the full hardware dual SIM seemed like it it's actually still more, uh,
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.520]  more useful than having the eSIM. Yeah. Uh, it's no good.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.720]  eSIM is no good for me.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.720]  I figured out because as somebody who reviews iPhones and also sometimes
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.960]  Android or at least tries Android phones and maybe wants to try using my main
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.800]  number with them,
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.920]  but especially with just using several iPhones a year based on getting review
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.320]  units, um,
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.000]  just being able to pop out an actual SIM card and pop it into another phone is,
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.200]  is just, I kind of need it. But for most people,
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.520]  the eSIM thing should be better, but I wish it were more secure. Anyway,
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.920]  it's not secure. If you're out there, don't use your phone number as a,
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.520]  your cell phone number as second factor. It's really dangerous. Yeah.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.960]  That's the main thing. Yeah. And if you have to use a phone number,
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.120]  get a Google voice number and you know, it's just, and,
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.840]  and if you run a service that that requires a phone number as a second factor,
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.960]  uh, push your, push the people at your service to,
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:23.120]  to support something like a Google authenticator and authy and those things
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.200]  that give you these one-time codes and stuff like that.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.280]  Anything other than phone numbers. Uh, there,
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.440]  let me take another break right here and I'll thank our third and final sponsor
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.760]  of the show. Our good friends at Eero, E-E-R-O. Eero blankets your whole home
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.080]  with fast, reliable wifi, eliminating poor coverage, dead spots,
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.040]  and buffering give you a consistently strong signal wherever you need it.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.320]  How do they do it?
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.840]  It's by not trying to do the whole thing with one box that somehow supposedly
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.680]  could go through walls upstairs and fill your entire house with a strong wifi
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.400]  signal. What Eero does is use multiple devices.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.600]  You get one main one plugs right into your cable modem and then you set up a
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.480]  couple of others around the house and they've got all sorts of great stuff at
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.120]  their website that will help you figure out how many you need based on the size
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.000]  and shape of your house. Obviously if you've got like a two room apartment,
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.800]  two might be great. If you have a large four story house, you might need three,
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.320]  four. They'll help you out. It's very easy. Um,
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.400]  and you manage it.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.000]  You don't have to do any sort of complicated stuff or network.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.160]  It's not your network engineer trying to get, Oh, I want to,
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.100]  I want to add a third one. Uh, what do I have to do?
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:37.400]  Type in IP addresses and do this and do that. No, nothing like that.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  You manage it all from a dead simple app on your phone and it lets you do
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.680]  everything from set up new devices to do something like pause the wifi for
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.360]  dinner or get alerts. If new devices attempt to join your network,
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:54.800]  all sorts of great stuff. Uh, anyway, the long, long story short,
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.920]  you wind up with a strong wifi signal throughout your entire house.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.120]  So no more dead spot in the master bedroom just because it's on the third or
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.520]  fourth floor or something like that. Uh, really great.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:08.080]  You're hearing me talk right now to you,
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.920]  to Dan Fromer over in your own network. Love it. Really strong signal.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.040]  Um, I, I, I really love the product. I've been using it for years.

[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.360]  You run the actual points party. Uh,
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.160]  can't go without talking a little bit about apple card. Um,
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.440]  one thing I have a bit of followup where a couple of weeks ago when I was
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.200]  talking about apple card,
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.880]  I think with Jim Dalrymple and I was talking about how I prefer cash back to
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.320]  points and I'm big.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.360]  I've had Amex for like 10 years and we've got a gazillion points.
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.640]  Um, but that my, and I know I talk to you about this every year, Dan,
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.840]  but about how do I figure out how much money an Amex point is worth?
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.680]  It is maddeningly hard. I spoke,
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.680]  speaking out of my ass a few weeks ago on the show said that I tend to think of
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.760]  them as being worth 2 cents each and a whole bunch of readers were like,
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.400]  you're nuts. They're nowhere near 2 cents each. Although, you know,
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.680]  depending on what you do, like through Amex travel,
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.440]  you can maybe make them worth that.
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.700]  But like the way that like Amazon lets you use your Amex points just to buy
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:57.320]  stuff from Amazon, you're only getting like a seven tenths of a cent per point,
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.760]  or something like that. So me valuing them at 2 cents each,
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.680]  which would be the equivalent of 2% cash back is probably, uh, probably wrong.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:09.980]  It's a little ambitious, although I think that is what the point and the,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.760]  the points guy is, is the points guy.com, which is, uh, uh, you know,
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.480]  the, probably the biggest, um, point site.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.720]  And it's like a hundred employees now or something like that.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.560]  So if you look on their site,
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.720]  it says Amex membership rewards are worth 2 cents each. Um,
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.640]  and same as chase points. Uh, that is,
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.320]  that is very, very ambitious, um,
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.500]  optimistic based on a very specific thing,
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:46.040]  which is transferring them to, uh, a partner.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.560]  So, you know,
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.780]  one of the things you can do with the Amex points and chase points and some
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:55.240]  other points programs is transfer them sometimes on a one-to-one basis,
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.920]  sometimes on a slightly different ratio to other programs. Um,
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.080]  like an airline or something.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.560]  Exactly. And then use them to book award travel in,
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.080]  you know, first class or business class,
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.440]  and then use the theoretical value of that ticket based on a cash
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.920]  fare that you would never actually pay like a $10,000 ticket. Right.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.400]  And then you do the math and then you get to, you know,
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.440]  and it can be more than 2 points, 2 cents. It could be 5 cents. It could be,
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:31.560]  you know, 3 to 4 cents. Um, and that, you know, when,
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:35.520]  when I get that kind of rate, it's usually, and I have an Amex too.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.540]  I mostly do chase points when I, when I get that rate,
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.880]  it's when I transfer points usually to, um,
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.080]  um, often to a Hyatt hotel account or something like that,
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.400]  and book a room in Tokyo that would cost $800 or something like that. Right.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:56.040]  That's what I'm getting more than 2 cents a point. It's rare though,
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:56.680]  to do that.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.160]  And Amex actually gives you a worse deal than chase when you're just using their
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:06.320]  booking site. Um, which I didn't know. I, you know, I got this Amex, um,
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.520]  uh, early this year or late last year. And, uh, and I didn't realize that the,
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.720]  the points would be worth so little when you're booking through their system.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.880]  Um, chase, chase actually gives you a better deal. It gives you,
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.000]  if you have the reserve, it gives you one and a half cents per point. Um, you know,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.040]  guaranteed basically. And Amex is,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.480]  I think 1 cent per point if you're booking a flight and even less,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.520]  if you're booking a hotel. Uh, but it really depends on the, on the thing.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.120]  So yeah, the maximum value again is, is transferring it. Um,
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.840]  which is totally doable if, if you'd specifically know what you want.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.440]  And, and then again, if you're going to assign,
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:48.640]  if you're going to really believe that the cash value is how much it's worth.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.520]  I mean, I don't think either of us are going to spend 10 grand even on a first
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.080]  class flight to Hong Kong or something like that. Some people do,
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.520]  people do every day. It's amazing. Um,
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:05.000]  what was that terrible leak that like Apple was on United?
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.680]  I think it was or that they just have a standing order for, for like 40,
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.640]  a lot of business class, 40 seats every single day on flights to,
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.000]  uh, Beijing or something like that. Um,
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.720]  it's nice if you can do it, I guess. Uh, so yeah, so that's where the,
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.560]  that 2 cents,
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.800]  I try not to get less than one and a half cents per point from,
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.480]  from chase and Amex and those types of things. This summer,
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:35.480]  I used some Amex points, uh, very well to take some last minute flights,
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.480]  um, that for whatever reason were priced inexpensively in points.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:47.000]  Uh, I think I was flying from Paris to Milan for the, uh, furniture festival. Um,
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.160]  but if you had paid cash for them, it was like 800 euros or something.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.520]  Well, that, that was one of the things that I heard from a couple of readers or
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.200]  listeners, I guess, since I only talked about it,
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.160]  but a couple of listeners who obviously know way more about it than I do said
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.880]  the same thing, that one of the, that, that if you ever make last minute travel
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.640]  or flights, and you know,
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.960]  I tend to because stuff like Apple events tend that invitations don't tend to
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:12.080]  come far in advance. Uh, and you know, it just happens,
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.840]  but that the point that when you book with points typically are not always
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.200]  cause they're airlines and so always never applies.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:22.520]  But typically the points value doesn't go up when you're closer, you know,
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.680]  when you book last minute, like you, you know,
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.160]  like a Paris to Milan flight might be the same number of points,
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.320]  whether you're booked three months in advance or three days in advance.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.160]  And you can really, you know,
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.360]  score some deals that way in terms of what you would actually pay.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.800]  Because a lot of the times when you book last minute and you're paying,
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.120]  just paying for the flight, you're like, Oh my God,
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.680]  I can't believe what I'm paying for this flight for a seat coach.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.760]  Totally. Um, and the, the,
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.560]  the maddening thing about points is that there's no hard and fast rule.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.000]  Like it could actually be more points. It could be fewer. Um,
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.400]  one crazy thing that tends to happen is that sometimes airlines open up cheap
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.560]  points tickets, right? Right before the flight goes the day before.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:10.760]  And I of course am a jerk. So if I noticed that last year,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.520]  I had a, uh, an expensive points ticket booked.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.080]  And I noticed that like the day before that they'd opened up a cheaper points
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.600]  tickets. So I called in and had half my points refunded to me. Um,
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.280]  but Hey, got to do it. Right. Uh, so yeah,
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.680]  that's a great strategy is using points for, for last minute. One thing that,
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.000]  um, that I didn't know until I got the MX card was I didn't realize it took a
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.960]  whole statement, basically two statements before you get your points,
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.680]  which makes the Apple cash thing actually really,
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  really compelling because you literally get the cash the next morning. Um,
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:52.040]  and I'm, I'm finding that now that I've had my card for a couple of weeks now,
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.880]  my Apple card, I find that very satisfying and it's irrational cause you know,
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:59.480]  it's, you know, it's sometimes it's like,
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.600]  I just bought a six pack of beer and I'm getting 70 cents back or,
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.240]  or I don't even know what it is, you know, but, uh, you know, it's these,
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.520]  sometimes it's like a quarter or something like that. Uh,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.440]  but I still find it satisfying. It's like, Hey, here, here's some cash.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.760]  It's just right there. There you go. Yep. Yeah. And I think, you know, again,
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:23.760]  if you're going to invest a lot of time and energy into and collect points and,
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:25.600]  you know,
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.920]  put together the trip of a lifetime or the trip of a year once or twice a year,
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.400]  you can totally get a lot of value out of it. Um, I, you know, someday,
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.640]  I'll actually do the math and remember to write everything down and see like
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:41.680]  what my total redemption value for the year is. You know,
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.040]  it could be as high as 5% of my spend. It could be even more, I don't,
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.240]  I don't know. But if you're not,
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.400]  and if you just want some rewards and you want them quickly and you want them
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.480]  to be useful, you know,
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.080]  I've already earned like two free coffees from apple cart and I barely use it
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.440]  and, and just use it right away. And I think for a lot of people,
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.920]  that'll be super compelling. Yeah.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.920]  So basically what I've concluded is that it, like you said,
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:13.120]  it's optimistic to treat Amex points and you do get a point per dollar spent.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.400]  So if I buy one, a dollar on my Amex,
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.080]  I get a point two months later and you, I think you still have the platinum.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.480]  So you probably get five points per dollar on, on airplane tickets and stuff
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.440]  like that. Yeah. But yeah, but we also got the American cards,
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:33.440]  so now we're using that for the tickets. But, but,
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:38.440]  but basically if, if it's optimistic to treat an Amex point as,
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.560]  as worth two cents,
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.080]  on a day to day basis,
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.480]  just going out buying groceries and doing all these things where I can use apple
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:54.280]  pay and day to day, my life here in Philadelphia,
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.600]  I can use apple pay just about everywhere that I, you know, just,
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.120]  just running errands.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.120]  I just use the apple card now because getting 2% cash back to me,
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.080]  it's like, well then it's, there's no optimism about it.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:12.200]  I'm just getting 2% back in a cash account. So why not?
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440]  So anything where I actually have to hand the card over,
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.000]  I still use the Amex and anything where I can use apple pay.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.080]  I just use apple card.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.880]  Yep. Yeah. It's, you know, it ends up being a pretty decent deal,
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.560]  especially relative to most, you know, most,
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.280]  I think half of the spending. So I wrote about this a bit on,
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.600]  on the new consumer. I wrote a couple of pieces on,
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.600]  I wrote one piece on apple card so far and I should write my new points party
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.720]  on apple card soon. The 2% is actually pretty good. I mean,
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.600]  half of all spending is still on debit cards where people are getting nothing.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.960]  A lot of that is because people either do not want or can't get credit cards,
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:53.600]  although.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.040]  So that's part of what apple's trying to do is make it easier to get a credit
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.480]  card and make it less punishing.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.040]  I mean you still can spiral into debt, which is not good,
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.120]  but the, the, the fee structure, at least for the apple card, no late fees,
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.600]  no overcharge fees,
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:12.440]  all that kind of stuff is a lot friendlier than than most cards period.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.840]  But 2% is not, it's not, it's not bad.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.880]  And what's interesting is this little economy that started to happen and you
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.240]  know, they've already reached a, they had the launch deal with Uber.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.400]  I'm not sure how long it goes for Uber.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.320]  If you use Uber and the apple card through the Uber,
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.680]  I think it's only through apple pay. I'm not entirely sure.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.800]  I'm not sure how that works either.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:41.200]  Well, either way, they, they give you 3% back instead of two.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.480]  So that's 50% more, more reward spending on Uber.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.880]  Thought it was interesting. They did it with Uber,
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.800]  even though they're shareholders and lift or at least were anyway,
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.040]  it doesn't matter. But and then on the other end,
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.560]  the apple cash economy,
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:00.400]  and I don't know how much they're going to talk about apple cash because
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.840]  I think apple card is probably the main message at least for now,
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.920]  but you could see a world in which redeeming your apple cash,
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.680]  you could also get a deal, whether you're spending it at, you know,
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.520]  a partner or on, you know, on, on the iTunes store or whatever,
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.720]  where they could multiply your apple cash by, you know,
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.280]  some certain amount in exchange for using it toward
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.640]  something. I haven't, that, that hasn't really started yet.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.640]  Right now, apple cash is just worth, you know, whatever it is,
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:34.720]  but I could see some,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.000]  I could imagine an interesting economy picking up around apple cash at some
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.960]  point, the way that square cash and some of the other ones have built
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  bonus programs. Although square has since ruined the,
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:52.640]  Oh, this, I wanted to, this was the thing. So where were,
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.480]  I forget when I was in New York and you and I,
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.000]  and you introduced me to this something like, uh,
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.080]  it was almost a year ago, man. Well, you introduced me. So I,
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.000]  I've had the square cash account. That's where you use it.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.040]  The cat, they just call it cash. It's the little green cash app, cash app.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.080]  And I've been using that to send money to friends, you know,
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.800]  to square up deals where one person puts a credit card in, you'd send, you know,
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.360]  you square cash and it's easy to hook it up to your bank account and move,
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.600]  move money in either direction, you know,
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.880]  without paying any fees at all just to, you know,
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.960]  put more money in my square cash account, blah, blah, blah.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.760]  What you can do with the square cash is you can say, give me a debit card,
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:36.960]  not a credit card, a debit card. And, uh, they send you a debit card. And, uh,
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:41.280]  it's nice cause you can like sign your name and then they actually like laser
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.320]  embed the signature right on the front of the card.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.240]  Or you could draw like a funny face. You could do whatever you want with it.
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:50.040]  Uh, make your own little design. But anyway,
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.600]  the reason you turned me onto this was that they have these things.
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.320]  They actually do have rewards, even though it's a debit card,
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.400]  they call them boosts and it's a weird system and it's just the only way it
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.520]  would pop. Like no bank could ever offer this.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  This could only happen from a startup with VC money coming in through a fire
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.240]  hose. Like no bank could ever do this.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:14.720]  They're a public company now, which is crazy. But yeah. Uh, but no, no,
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.800]  no sane bank would ever do this. Right. Uh,
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:22.880]  like in the same way that no traditional retailer could just take all of their
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.560]  profits and pump it back into the business like Amazon did for ever, you know,
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.040]  as opposed to actually turning a profit. Uh, uh,
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.200]  it's, you know,
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:37.880]  but the boosts actually pay and the one boost and the idea is that they, they,
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:41.520]  every month or so they change the boosts that are offered and I guess they have
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:44.320]  partnerships with some of these companies and some of them they just do on their
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:47.680]  own. But they had for a while, they had like a Shake Shack boost. And if you,
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.080]  and you can only have one boost on your account at a time,
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.840]  you go in the app and you say, here's the boost I want. I want Shake Shack.
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.520]  And if you go to Shake Shack, you'd get like, I don't know,
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.720]  15% off your order or something like that. Um, they had,
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.160]  they've still have whole foods on there and you can get free.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.080]  I think what they offer is like 5% up to $200 or something like that.
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:10.240]  So it's equivalent to getting like the Amazon, uh,
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:14.360]  or the whole foods card or whatever it is that you can get 5% at whole foods.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:15.720]  But the one that you, that,
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.200]  that made me get the card is they had a,
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:23.360]  it was a coffee shop boost and any coffee shop you could buy,
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:27.320]  they would give you a dollar back, not like a percentage, a dollar.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.400]  And I tend to buy just plain drip coffee.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.080]  So it's like two 50 or $3 I go in,
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.640]  get a coffee for $2 and 50 cents. And using that card,
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.640]  I would get a full dollar back every time. And I use that.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.600]  I got the card as soon as you told me to, I've used it for a year.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.160]  And now the bastards have taken it away.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:52.680]  I don't understand how it works anymore. Well, now I'm looking at it right now.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:56.760]  Now you have to use the card five times to unlock the boost.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:00.600]  So basically they're trying to get you because people like me who only use it on
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:04.480]  boost purchases, I never used it for it a year.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.080]  The card a is totally worn out because, because the,
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.440]  the the,
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.880]  the nearest coffee shop to me doesn't take Apple pay.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.920]  So I'd have to hand the card over. And so they were scanning it.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.080]  That's all I used it for.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.480]  It was buying coffee and I was getting,
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.920]  I was getting like the equivalent of a 40% cash back.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.240]  It was a great deal. I mean, and the whole foods used to be 10%. Now it's 5%,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.120]  but 10% back at whole foods is crazy.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.840]  Like that's way better deal than the Amazon card was giving.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:39.720]  You can't, you cannot get, you can't get 10% on any credit card. That's insane.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.600]  No. Yeah. Uh, unless, no.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:47.000]  And even 5% is a really good deal, especially on a debit card where you're not,
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.400]  you know, you, there's no,
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.760]  even if you're resistant to credit cards on principle or something like that,
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:55.440]  5% is great.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.040]  Yeah. I know how to get 10% back at whole foods,
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.720]  but it only happens sometimes. Um, anyway,
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:06.200]  uh, Rick points, party.com. Uh, I talk about it there, I think. But,
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:12.320]  um, yeah, basically they just want you to use the card more to get that boost
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:15.080]  back. And then I think it's only valid for five times after that.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.560]  It's still basically good for five bucks every once in a while too. Yeah.
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:22.000]  But I don't want to use that card anywhere else. No, what they have,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.320]  and now it's a, so I'm looking at my right now, 10% off at sweet green,
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:31.040]  5% off a ticket master, 10% off bed bath and beyond.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.480]  Um, but the, the one that is an official partnership now actually is 15% off
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.760]  every order at door dash. Um, and they,
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.120]  they just did a big deal with door dash. They sold caviar to door dash.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.280]  Caviar was the food delivery service that square had owned.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.440]  I didn't know that square on that. Okay.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.440]  Yeah. So they sold it to door dash and they're doing this, uh,
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.880]  marketing partnership with, uh, the boost as well.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:01.720]  So if you look at most of the boosts, it says at the bottom, uh,
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.920]  whole foods has nothing to do with this boost provided solely by cash
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.120]  app. Um, the one with door dash does not say that.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.080]  So that is an official partnership,
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.400]  but it's a very clever idea because again,
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:18.440]  much like the apple cash and even actually more than the apple cash,
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:21.840]  it's money that you get back instantly and it's actual money.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.400]  It's not points that will show up in a month and a half that you can use for
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.080]  something else. So it's little cash,
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.680]  literal cash in a debit card account that you, if you choose to,
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.680]  you can just transfer at no fee right to your checking account or wherever else
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.120]  you have hooked up or send it to your friend. You know, I can send, uh,
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.800]  my friend Dan, uh, you know, money and it just right there from the money I got
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:47.400]  for buying stuff, you know, with these boosts. So anyway,
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.920]  it's a cool thing to have. And again, you don't pay anything. You sign up,
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.000]  you get your cash account,
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:56.360]  it's free and then you transfer money to start funding it free,
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.600]  get the card free. And, uh, you know, so I rec,
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.840]  I still recommend it even though they took away my beloved coffee shop boost,
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.560]  uh, or at least they took it away from applying every single time. But yeah,
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:09.960]  it's still a cool thing to have.
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.800]  It's fun. And, and cash app is one of those things where, you know,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.440]  among the tech nerd, uh, or like media Twitter,
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:21.200]  people don't really use it that much. Like Venmo, especially in New York is,
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.480]  is very popular. Cash app is huge. It's, uh,
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.360]  the square said in their earnings last quarter,
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.240]  I think that three and a half million people were using the cat,
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.160]  the cash card alone in the month of June. So that's a lot of people.
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.840]  I think it's only in America too. So that's a huge success.
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.400]  It's one of the top apps. If you look in the app store, download rankings,
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:44.560]  especially on the weekend, it's always in the top, I don't know,
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:48.880]  25 or something like that. So yeah, because it's got, it's got the built in,
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.520]  almost social media viral effect where of course you're going to get more people
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.720]  who join in, like, especially on weekends for the,
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.440]  I think that the check sharing thing is just gotta be, it's so obvious,
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:00.880]  right?
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.040]  So you go out with a bunch of pals and a couple of you already have the cash
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.560]  app and then you can say, Oh, what's the cash app? And they say, Oh,
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:09.080]  it's a free app. And if you do it, then we, you know,
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.400]  you can send me a 15 bucks to square up the meal. Uh, you know,
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:16.520]  no pun intended. Uh, so you can totally see how it spreads and they're,
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:19.080]  you know, you'd tell people, Hey, no fees, there is no feed, nothing,
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:22.720]  no fee to sign up, no fee to transfer money. And it's super easy to use.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.600]  It's actually a really nicely designed app in my opinion. Um,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.320]  there's one or two things that they're hidden behind. Like you have to like tap
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.600]  your, your avatar or something like that to get it. It's a little,
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:39.200]  but for the most part it's designed for millennials who read with their fingers
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.640]  or something like that. Yeah. But, and you know, and it, and,
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.080]  and much like apple card, it's totally modern. And when you, uh,
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.600]  buy something, you get a little notification that it was used immediately.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.800]  Um, which is, I love, you know,
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.600]  cause it gives you that reassurance that if somebody does skim your number or
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.040]  something like that and you're, as soon as they try,
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:00.680]  as soon as they use your number to buy something,
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.280]  you're going to get a notification on your phone that tells you it was used. Uh,
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.760]  so anyway, I recommend it and all thanks to you. I had the cash account,
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:13.200]  but the card, you know, I have to thank, I have to thank you. Yeah, it's cool.
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.360]  The other funny thing is, uh, it's one of those things where, you know,
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.600]  I never really see ads for it,
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.000]  but the minute you leave a big city and turn the radio on somewhere,
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.360]  there's ads ads for cash app all the time on the radio, which is kind of funny.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.760]  It's like one of those things where it's a truly mainstream product that the
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.960]  like tech elite just don't really use as much. Yeah, whatever. Good.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.400]  And square is still doing a good job too. On the other end,
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.200]  on the retail end where I see it more and more shops where we're at places where
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.880]  I do use, uh, Apple pay where they've got the square readers,
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360]  uh, you know, for doing it
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.480]  for, for doing your transaction. They've got the cool thing like the, uh, uh,
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:58.240]  lock column bay, which is my favorite coffee shop here in center city, Philly.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:03.560]  Um, they've got those ones where it's like two tablets. And so the, the,
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.120]  there's a bigger tablet that faces the person behind the counter and a smaller
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.960]  tablet facing the customer so that they don't have to,
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.960]  like a lot of the iPad based point of sale things where there's just the one
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:17.800]  iPad, they have to pivot it around for you to see it and you know,
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:22.920]  tap how much of a tip you want or whatever, you know, which isn't onerous,
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.920]  onerous, however you pronounce the word. Uh, but the,
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.440]  the little dual tablet system that the square terminals have is really elegant.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.320]  And in my experience, I don't know,
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.360]  it could just be like the placebo effect that I think that they are good and
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:41.080]  faster. To me, they seem to work faster where the,
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:43.360]  the NFC reader is very,
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:46.560]  very fast with the iPhone and the transaction goes through faster.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:49.040]  But that could just be my imagination,
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.880]  possibly the first responsive Android tablet in history.
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.560]  I guess they're Android.
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:57.120]  I guess they have to be cause it would be insane if they wrote their own
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.360]  operating system from scratch scratch, but I see. Well maybe it would,
[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:06.000]  it would presumably be Android based at any rate, but with, you know,
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.840]  with their own complete control over everything that goes into it, it's,
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:09.280]  it is,
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.160]  it's very iPad like in terms of responsiveness and accuracy of the touch and
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.680]  stuff like that. Yeah. And the, the build quality, not to be that guy,
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:20.200]  but the build quality seems very nice too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:25.360]  It's a very nice thing. I think square overall is, uh, in some ways it seems
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.400]  more, I think, I think there's good reason for it too.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.760]  It's square of the two Jack Dorsey companies seems the more Jack Dorsey,
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:39.400]  whereas Twitter went through so many weird total upheavals where Dorsey was out
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.520]  and, uh,
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:47.920]  they brought in Dick and there was the times when, uh,
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.280]  what's his name was the CEO. Uh, the medium guy, uh,
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.880]  Williams was, you know, they, they, they,
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:59.280]  and then Ev was in and then he was out and then Dick was gone and Jack is back
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:04.280]  and, and Twitter is such a weird mishmash of everything,
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.880]  you know, like I, in my opinion,
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.400]  no one would look at Twitter's stuff and think that's a really elegant design.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.480]  It's not bad. It's not ugly, but it's,
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:16.880]  there's a lot of complex stuff where it's everything from square is very,
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.880]  very tidy in my experience from their hardware to their apps.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:27.280]  Uh, it's a, it's a company I really admire. Yeah. Uh,
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:32.000]  uh, anything else? Huh? I think we've run the gamut there. Yeah.
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.600]  Uh, I don't expect anything else from the event.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.720]  I know that there's max stuff coming. I don't expect them to do it.
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:41.880]  I think that the whole event will be phones, watches,
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.120]  and services. Some wacky thing happened this week where people are like, Oh,
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:47.160]  AR glasses.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.400]  I also would be surprised if the tile tracker thing isn't in next week's event
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:58.920]  that it's just, uh, could be, but I, you know, I don't know.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.400]  I just feel like I feel like the phones,
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.440]  watches and services alone would be enough to fill the event and then why
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:09.960]  dilute it with further stuff. Right.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.840]  Have there been a hardware leaks of that or anything like that?
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.880]  Or is it just the software? Just the software, I think.
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.240]  And the only hardware that's leaked is the diagrams of the things,
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.480]  the little circles that are in the software, you know,
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.520]  that if you poke about the iOS 13 beta,
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.880]  there's things that suggest it's like a little,
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:29.360]  like a coin type thing with an apple logo in the middle.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.720]  So I know they've probably learned their lesson,
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.400]  but this could this be one of those things where they're like,
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.680]  and we're working on these little taggers.
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.120]  No, I hope not. I think that they've learned a lesson. I've heard,
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  I've actually, you know,
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.920]  you're referencing air power and that they announced that premature.
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:51.560]  I've heard AirPods too were delayed quite a bit after the initial announcement,
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.920]  but I don't think that they regret it. I think that they announced, I think they,
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.400]  I, I, I feel like they wish they, cause they did come out before Christmas.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.000]  So I feel like that's as late as they could come out the day before, but yeah.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.760]  But I kind of feel like they needed to announce, you know,
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:12.400]  like they needed to be announced with the phones that dropped the headphone
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.920]  jack. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't think they regret it.
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.440]  I know from talking to several people at apple that there's a
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.760]  real, uh, uh, it's not just, Hey,
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.360]  we screwed up with air power. It was,
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.800]  this was screw up in terms of gambling on a product that we,
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.720]  we didn't know we could build yet. Yeah. You know, man, I still want it.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.800]  I know. But yeah. So yeah, I could, I don't know the,
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.200]  cause the hardware is the stuff that often is the thing that leaks,
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:48.880]  which is crazy. So I don't know. I don't, I'm not sure what a,
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.480]  what a better time to, I guess when it's ready is the right answer,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.680]  but I'm not sure when a better time to, to roll that out would be,
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:59.400]  do you think there'll be new air pods? No, I don't. I think,
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.040]  cause I think these second generation ones just came out and I know that there
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.280]  are some rumors and I know Gurman said that they're working on future ones,
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:09.520]  but I can't imagine that they would come out before Christmas. I really don't.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.240]  I think that would be a next year thing. Cool. All right.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:16.760]  Then it sounds like a pretty simple, a simple thing. Uh,
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:20.600]  I guess the home pod is the one thing that I,
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:23.440]  that seems like there would be a hardware leak from that too.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.360]  If there was something new.
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:24.720]  Well,
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:28.360]  there's a rumor that they're coming out with one with only two tweeters instead
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.800]  of seven, uh, which I, you know,
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.040]  I was talking to Jim Dalrymple about it and he's, he's a bigger music guy than me,
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.360]  but I can only imagine that that would be a,
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.160]  a new lower cost home pod in addition to the existing home pod,
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:43.800]  because I just can't see the home pods.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:46.160]  The whole appeal of the home pod is how good it sounds. And there's just,
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:49.040]  no matter how smart it is, there's no way to tweet or one.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:52.320]  It could be better than the seven tweeter ones. So I don't know.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:55.240]  That would be cool. But again, I don't expect it. I would expect that later,
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.720]  you know, like an October event like an October next year. Who knows? Yeah.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:01.680]  But like, even if all that stuff's ready,
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.720]  like the October events are always a little bit lower key in every regard and
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:11.840]  they, they can therefore jump around more and say, here's the new Mac,
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:15.960]  here's the Mac pro we promise at WWDC and here's a new Mac book pro 16 inch
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.080]  size. That's like this. And here's the tile tracker.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.880]  And we've got two new iPad pros and you know,
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:26.280]  and jump around and do that. Whereas the September one, I feel like they,
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:28.760]  they don't want to cram a lot of stuff in there.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.960]  And in the services narrative is so important to them in terms of their,
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:40.120]  the story that they're selling the wall street that I really, you know,
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.120]  I, I can't, I'd be shocked.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:47.000]  I would be absolutely shocked if they don't unveil all of the details for the
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.280]  services they announced back in March on Tuesday, including pricing,
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:56.280]  including dates and doing that at their highest profile event of the year,
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:06:00.920]  they're going to want to distract from that as little as possible.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:05.080]  And therefore the only other thing I expect would be the phones and the watches.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.680]  Makes sense. That's what I think. But you know, who knows?
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:13.920]  Uh, I had one more idea, but, uh, I forgot it.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:15.160]  Yeah.
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:23.960]  Yeah, it probably wasn't good. Anyway, Dan Fromer, thank you. Uh,
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:28.960]  so the new consumer is at new consumer.com.
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:32.520]  Excellent newsletter. I enjoy every single issue of it.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:36.600]  I feel like also I enjoy the pace. If I want to complain, you know, we were,
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:40.920]  we were patent Ben Thompson on the back. I sometimes can't keep up with
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:45.080]  Stratechery. Not because I feel like he's writing needless words,
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:47.640]  but because it's just, he writes too many good words.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:51.400]  Whereas I really enjoy the couple of times a week pace of the new consumer.
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:54.600]  Thank you. Yeah. And if, if you're,
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:58.440]  if you care about e-commerce or consumer brands or marketing or just the
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:03.440]  future, uh, give it a shot. You know, consumer.com. Yeah, really enjoy it. Uh,
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.080]  and people can follow you on Twitter.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:10.080]  You're an excellent Twitter follow at from dome F R O M E D O M E on Twitter.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:14.680]  I enjoy you there too. Uh, my thanks to you. And, uh,
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:17.080]  let me thank our sponsors. Sometimes I forget to thank them at the end of the
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.600]  show. Uh, I'll go backwards.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:23.240]  Eero where you can go to get wifi that'll saturate your whole home.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:27.680]  Hello pillow, buckwheat pillow. That might change the way you sleep forever.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:33.000]  And then last but not least clear bank with a C for the bank, uh,
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.520]  where you can go to raise money for your, uh,
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:41.280]  uh, for your company. Really, really interesting sponsor of the show.
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.440]  They obviously think there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there and they're
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:08:05.440]  probably are listening to the show. My thanks to them, Dan. Thanks. See you soon.
