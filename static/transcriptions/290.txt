[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  Christina Warren, welcome to the talk show. It's good to have
[00:03.240 --> 00:03.480]  you.
[00:04.200 --> 00:05.960]  It's good to be here. Thanks for having me.
[00:06.320 --> 00:11.000]  It is the end of July. And ordinarily, we often have nothing
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.640]  to talk about but rehashing two month old WWDC news and instead,
[00:17.040 --> 00:21.560]  it is absolutely impossible to whittle the list of possible
[00:21.560 --> 00:24.680]  things to talk about. That is bizarre. What is going on that
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.360]  that the news is so overwhelming when we're when we're locked in
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.200]  there's got to be some kind of cause and effect here?
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.720]  Yeah, I think so I think is that we don't have like people have
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.040]  written about like the concept of doom scrolling where you kind
[00:38.040 --> 00:40.560]  of can't stop scrolling through all like the terrible things
[00:40.560 --> 00:42.960]  that are happening and you're kind of addicted to it. And I
[00:42.960 --> 00:45.880]  kind of feel like that's part of it. But even like putting the
[00:45.880 --> 00:49.280]  tenor aside, whether it's good or bad, it's just the fact that
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.640]  there's like, nothing else to do. So some people are more
[00:54.640 --> 00:57.640]  productive than others. One of my favorite artists, Taylor
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.840]  Swift just released a surprise album and it's very good. And I
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.040]  was like, and I've been shit posting on Twitter. Like, I've
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.240]  that's been my pandemic, right? Like, I've been trying to like,
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.600]  figure out well days blend into one another too, right? Has that
[01:13.600 --> 01:17.560]  been the case for you? Because I know it's been so weird. Because
[01:17.560 --> 01:21.800]  even though I've worked remotely somewhat for the last couple of
[01:21.800 --> 01:25.000]  years, and a lot of that has been on the road in another
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.120]  place, like this is just so weird. Like I never know what
[01:27.120 --> 01:29.760]  day or what week it is. It all blends together. I think that's
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.920]  part of it too. Like, there's just always deluge of things.
[01:32.920 --> 01:34.560]  And we never know what day we're on.
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.560]  Yeah, it is true. And, you know, it's, I'm not even complaining
[01:38.600 --> 01:43.160]  because it is suits me. And it's, you know, it certainly is
[01:43.200 --> 01:48.280]  my good fortune in life that I've eked out a career. And if
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.160]  it suits my personality that I, on a day to day basis, if you
[01:52.160 --> 01:55.760]  were just watching what I do, you may not know whether the
[01:55.760 --> 02:00.880]  footage is of me during Coronavirus times or me a year
[02:00.880 --> 02:04.480]  ago, or hopefully a year from now. I mean, it's and that's no
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.160]  exaggeration. There are, there are many days, pre-Corona, where
[02:09.160 --> 02:10.280]  I didn't leave the house.
[02:11.240 --> 02:16.120]  Sure. But you could, right? Like, that, that changes it for
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.560]  me, because there, I definitely did leave the house. And that's
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.600]  been weird for me. I'm like, I'm cooped up. But there have been
[02:21.600 --> 02:24.280]  times in my life where I'm like you, like, I would be completely
[02:24.280 --> 02:28.200]  content to just like, stay indoors and not go anywhere, but
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.000]  well, not being able to go anywhere.
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.120]  Yeah. And you know, we have our son is in heading into 11th
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.200]  grade, you know, and so school this during the school year,
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.640]  that certainly anchors the concept of weekdays and
[02:43.640 --> 02:49.560]  weekends, concretely. And even in summer vacations of the past,
[02:49.600 --> 02:52.320]  you know, that's when we would take vacations, we would travel
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.440]  and even then there still seemed to be more much more of a
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.560]  cohesive sense of, hey, it's Friday, should we go out to what
[03:00.560 --> 03:02.640]  you guys want to, you know, should we go out as a family and
[03:02.640 --> 03:08.640]  have dinner? You know, it's just the stupidest, most obvious
[03:08.720 --> 03:11.960]  thing in the world. Everybody knows, you know, restaurants are
[03:11.960 --> 03:15.080]  more crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, because that's
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.920]  when people go out. And that's when right, we would go out,
[03:17.960 --> 03:21.960]  because it's just what you do is what you do. And it's like,
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.120]  not even thinking like not even having that on the table is it
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.760]  really helps blur the whole thing. And, you know, and there's
[03:30.760 --> 03:33.280]  just all sorts of things that aren't happening. Sports don't
[03:33.280 --> 03:36.520]  happen. I mean, baseball is a thing I'm a big fan of. And they
[03:36.520 --> 03:39.080]  just started playing last night. And I'm like, God, is it weird?
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.400]  But it's, you know, there's, there's just things that anchor
[03:43.400 --> 03:46.880]  days or Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN, you know, and it's not
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.320]  that different. It's, you know, it's just a thing.
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.000]  No, but there's stuff. There are things that happen, like movies
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.360]  come out, you know, and yeah. How is your son doing with with
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.200]  all this stuff? Because he's what, like, 16, I guess, or 17?
[04:00.960 --> 04:07.080]  16. So I don't know. 16. Okay, so yeah, yeah, 16. Because he's
[04:07.080 --> 04:09.960]  going into 11th grade. Like, how is how is he dealing with this?
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.600]  Because it's got to be super weird to be that age, especially
[04:13.600 --> 04:16.280]  when I don't know what the age people can get their licenses in
[04:16.280 --> 04:19.600]  Pennsylvania. But you know, it's the time people start to drive
[04:19.600 --> 04:21.600]  and people have friends who have cars and things like that. And
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.360]  you finally get your mobility. So the driving thing is, the
[04:25.360 --> 04:28.080]  driving thing isn't an issue in his curious because we live
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.720]  right in the city. He has no interest in it. He could 16 is
[04:31.720 --> 04:34.720]  when you can get a driver's license in Pennsylvania. It's
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.160]  actually a source of minor contention within the family.
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.720]  Which is completely, you know, total generational shift. Like,
[04:44.720 --> 04:47.840]  Oh, yeah, my wife and I were 16. And we lived in the Pennsylvania
[04:47.840 --> 04:50.640]  suburbs, couldn't wait to get our driver's license. Because
[04:50.640 --> 04:53.880]  like you said, it meant freedom, you know, all of a sudden, you
[04:53.880 --> 04:56.040]  don't have to ask your parents to drive you to the movie, you
[04:56.040 --> 04:59.480]  and your pals to the movie theater. It was, you know, you
[04:59.480 --> 05:02.640]  could drive somebody if somebody if one of your gang had a car,
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.320]  you could all just run into it and go to the movies. And in
[05:05.320 --> 05:07.840]  hindsight, also in hindsight, let me apologize to my own
[05:07.840 --> 05:14.760]  parents. Because as of now, I if I if my son wanted me to ask if
[05:14.760 --> 05:17.920]  I could be the parent to drive the gang to the movie theater,
[05:18.080 --> 05:20.880]  and somebody you know, even if you know, and somebody else's
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.680]  parent has already agreed to pick up that was the thing who's
[05:23.680 --> 05:27.880]  going to drive who's going to pick up? I mean, I would do it
[05:27.880 --> 05:29.920]  and I'd be a good sport about it. I wouldn't, you know, I'd
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.840]  go in and try to, you know, say hi, be friendly, but also not be
[05:34.840 --> 05:38.040]  the awkward, you know, dad who talks to dad, you know, yeah, I
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.240]  think I think I'm a good, I think I'm good at that. I think
[05:40.240 --> 05:42.680]  I have a good, you know, I don't look like I don't want to be
[05:42.680 --> 05:46.800]  there. But I also am not, you know, I know, my role is the
[05:46.800 --> 05:51.400]  taxi driver is not to be the one talking. But the fact that I
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.960]  don't never have to do that is actually a great relief. But
[05:54.960 --> 05:57.680]  anyway, the source of contention is that my wife is of the
[05:57.680 --> 06:01.960]  opinion and I I tend to side with her, that it's sort of like
[06:01.960 --> 06:06.080]  learning to swim. And even if you don't enjoy swimming, it is
[06:06.080 --> 06:10.000]  an excellent life skill. Because then if you're ever, you know,
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.240]  in the water, you rather than drowning, do it, you can do it.
[06:16.560 --> 06:20.080]  And that learning to drive a car is like that even if you live in
[06:20.080 --> 06:25.280]  a city and do not want to ever own a car. And you don't really
[06:25.280 --> 06:29.000]  need to. It is an excellent life skill to have in an emergency.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.800]  Yeah, she's right. I don't drive. And I have driven but I
[06:33.800 --> 06:40.600]  don't have a driver's license. I haven't in I mean, like 15, 16
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.920]  years, at least. And even when I did, when I was your son's age,
[06:44.960 --> 06:47.480]  I had a car, I didn't have a license, my friends would just
[06:47.480 --> 06:50.880]  drive my car. But your wife is kind of right. Because Yeah,
[06:50.880 --> 06:53.160]  right. I was like that. I mean, it was perfect for me. I was
[06:53.160 --> 06:54.720]  like, I don't want to drive. You want to drive me around? That's
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.280]  fine. And my parents never had like a problem. You know,
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.440]  taking me places if I needed that. And I was always able to
[07:00.440 --> 07:03.400]  figure it out. But even though I've lived in cities where I
[07:03.440 --> 07:06.520]  don't need that, and then you know, the, you know, advent of
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.160]  Uber and stuff like that. It's been fine until now. And now in
[07:11.160 --> 07:13.960]  these times where you don't feel super comfortable getting in a
[07:13.960 --> 07:16.480]  car with someone and I don't want to rely on my husband to
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.280]  have to take me places and whatnot. Like, I've actually
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.280]  been thinking I'm like, I might have to when you know, things
[07:23.280 --> 07:26.880]  are safer, like take some driving lessons. And I don't
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.360]  want to own a car but would get that skill. So your wife has a
[07:30.360 --> 07:33.760]  point it is it's an interesting area of Corona time. So anyway,
[07:33.760 --> 07:37.560]  our son 16 legally could drive my wife wanted him to. And
[07:37.600 --> 07:40.360]  probably if this hadn't happened, it might have happened
[07:40.360 --> 07:43.880]  by now. But even though we own a car and could I guess teach him
[07:43.880 --> 07:46.320]  to drive it? I don't know. It just seems like why bother in
[07:46.320 --> 07:49.720]  Corona times, but he has no interest in it. It honestly, it
[07:49.720 --> 07:53.000]  honestly it sounds to him like would you like to sign up to
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.040]  take extra classes and learn a bunch of rules to take a test
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.320]  that you have no interest in actually using? I mean, like it
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.640]  might as well be like, you know, learning to fix the plumbing in
[08:04.640 --> 08:07.400]  your house. Again, not a bad thing to learn. It's not like
[08:07.400 --> 08:09.560]  he's saying nobody should learn to drive but he doesn't want to
[08:09.560 --> 08:13.080]  be a plumber. So why should he learn? Why should he go and take
[08:13.080 --> 08:15.480]  a test for that? So he doesn't even want to drive, which is
[08:15.480 --> 08:18.520]  crazy. But he you know, we live in the city his pals mostly live
[08:18.520 --> 08:21.880]  in the city. And the ones who don't live in the city come to
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.240]  you know, because the school is there. So right, not an issue.
[08:25.240 --> 08:27.160]  One of them has a car. Like that's all you need. You just
[08:27.160 --> 08:29.640]  need. Nobody needs a car. I don't think any of his friends
[08:29.680 --> 08:32.760]  know how to drive or will learn how to drive. Most it's a very
[08:32.760 --> 08:35.680]  Philly is a very walkable city. I think that you know, the
[08:35.680 --> 08:38.120]  issue you know, the thing is, the thing that the kids want to
[08:38.120 --> 08:42.760]  be able to do is take Ubers not not learn to drive. And so like,
[08:42.760 --> 08:45.600]  what that makes sense. Hey, can I take the car? You know, when I
[08:45.600 --> 08:48.280]  was 16, it was Can I take the car? My parents like, I don't
[08:48.280 --> 08:50.960]  know. Of course, you know, I'll just tell you the story. I don't
[08:50.960 --> 08:53.440]  just tell you the story of the first time. I think it was the
[08:53.440 --> 08:56.480]  very first time my parents let me drive their car to the movie.
[08:56.800 --> 09:00.880]  I was a rainy night. And I was driving downhill on the way back
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.840]  from the movie way too fast put on the brakes card in quite stop
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.560]  and I ran into the back of a Cadillac in front of me. I mean,
[09:08.560 --> 09:11.400]  nobody got hurt. It was like a true fender bender. But it was
[09:11.400 --> 09:17.280]  like, it you know, fenders were bent. Insurance was called. I
[09:17.280 --> 09:19.600]  mean, it was the worst. It's exactly why you don't want to
[09:19.600 --> 09:24.400]  give your car to a 16 year old. Terrible. So anyway, the thing
[09:24.400 --> 09:27.120]  that kids today, at least in the city want is they want permission
[09:27.120 --> 09:29.480]  to be able to take Ubers. Of course, that's all pre corona
[09:29.480 --> 09:32.760]  time. Right? No, that's Yeah, I mean, I think and I guess that
[09:32.760 --> 09:35.800]  makes total sense. I grew up in the suburbs and we weren't far
[09:35.800 --> 09:38.400]  from the city. But I could see that like, it would be expensive
[09:38.400 --> 09:41.920]  if like, eight of us were trying to take a car someplace or if you
[09:41.920 --> 09:44.240]  want to go together, that would be the only reason I could maybe
[09:44.240 --> 09:48.000]  see some kids wanting it. But I think you're right. Like, I
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.960]  mean, it's weird. When I moved from New York to Seattle, there
[09:52.960 --> 09:55.200]  was some kind of thought that was like, Oh, are you going to
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.280]  have to drive now? I was like, no. And so I chose the
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.280]  neighborhood I live in. And I chose like to be near the bus
[10:01.280 --> 10:04.440]  that takes me to work. Like I have like a company bus that
[10:04.440 --> 10:07.840]  takes me to work, but I could take a regular bus as well. And
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.160]  you know, you just pick and choose that stuff. That said, for
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.640]  things like if I wanted to own my own house, I would have to
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.680]  drive. And so I'm not a homeowner for that and other
[10:20.680 --> 10:23.520]  reasons. Also the sheer cost but yeah.
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.640]  So anyway, how's he doing? He's doing fine. I think that for the
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.440]  boys, their socialization is largely online anyway. I mean,
[10:32.440 --> 10:35.800]  like his summer this year is really not that different from
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.800]  last year. They don't they get together to me and from my 16
[10:40.800 --> 10:43.400]  year old self who always wanted to get the hell out of the
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.920]  house. I mean, I love my parents. I still have a great
[10:45.920 --> 10:48.440]  relationship with them. But by the time I was 16, I was ready
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.120]  to get the hell out. I wanted to get out every day and stay stay
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.040]  out as long as I could get away with. They don't they don't
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.720]  really get together. I mean, their socialization and maybe if
[10:59.720 --> 11:02.240]  I had the you know, and you know, it's just all about the
[11:02.240 --> 11:05.560]  internet, you know, that he's socializing way more hours of
[11:05.560 --> 11:08.240]  the day than I ever did. You know, it's there. They're just
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.240]  online together all the time. And he has a, you know, gaming
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.920]  PC where he can play these amazing video games. I guess I
[11:15.920 --> 11:18.800]  wouldn't have left the house either. I think the girls, you
[11:18.800 --> 11:21.440]  know, we've asked him and I think the girls are taking it a
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.200]  little harder. And I think they still do get together in ways,
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.680]  you know, socially distant, responsible ways, hopefully. But
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.040]  even before the quarantine, the girls in his class got together
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.560]  in ways that seem much more familiar to me, as the way that
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.160]  10th and 11th, 12th grade teenagers socialize and get
[11:42.160 --> 11:43.600]  together than the boys did.
[11:44.320 --> 11:45.280]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[11:45.520 --> 11:51.080]  So we have a car we have we own one car to 2006 that we bought
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.760]  new, I think it has just under 55,000 miles. So we just we
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.880]  don't drive much. We have in the past even thought like, what do
[11:59.880 --> 12:03.600]  we do? Should we get a new car? I mean, it's 2006 car is sold
[12:03.600 --> 12:09.240]  that it didn't even have we were one year before Acura put in the
[12:09.240 --> 12:14.320]  30 pin iPod, iPod connectors. So we don't even have the 30 pin
[12:14.320 --> 12:18.000]  connector, let alone anything that you could connect a modern
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.480]  phone to there's nothing in there. You know, it's in terms
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.800]  of what you would connect for a road trip. It is, you know, it's
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.440]  dark ages. So we need a new car, but we don't drive. I mean, a
[12:30.440 --> 12:32.680]  car is in fantastic shape. Like I said, it doesn't even have 50
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.280]  1000 miles. But in the corona time, we're like, Oh, it's good
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.040]  that we own a car, right? Because we I wouldn't want to
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.240]  take an Uber and Uber would be one of the last things I'd want
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.280]  to do because you're in an enclosed space with somebody who
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.720]  you know, is visit, you know, there, there's been with a bunch
[12:49.720 --> 12:55.520]  of other people, right? So if we were going to drive anywhere, we
[12:55.520 --> 12:59.160]  would definitely drive our own car. But we drive so little in
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.400]  quarantine, that the my car battery didn't just die. It
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.840]  died, like hard, like the way they can't even like when you
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.160]  you know, I have one of those dinguses where you connect it to
[13:09.160 --> 13:12.040]  the you know, plug it in the wall, and it'll, you know, take
[13:12.040 --> 13:14.680]  a kind of dead battery and charge it up. It was like dead
[13:14.680 --> 13:18.040]  to dead to dead, because I and I was like, huh, I thought I
[13:18.040 --> 13:20.320]  started this car up a while ago. And then I was thinking about it.
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.240]  And it was like, well, wait, I did drive to pick up takeout on
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.720]  Easter. And then like, oh, it was on Mother's Day, when the
[13:29.720 --> 13:32.280]  car wouldn't start. And I was like, well, wait, and I was like,
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.840]  well, wait, Easter was. No, that was like, six weeks. Yeah. All
[13:35.840 --> 13:37.840]  right. Six weeks without starting the car. Yeah, I guess
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.360]  that would do it. Yeah. But it in terms of the time, it felt
[13:42.360 --> 13:45.400]  like, this is crazy. I just drove the car like a week ago.
[13:45.400 --> 13:47.000]  And then you know, it was like six weeks.
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.160]  Right? Well, that's the whole thing, as we were saying
[13:49.160 --> 13:51.880]  earlier, is that days are all blending together. So now like,
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.320]  now I've got a weekly reminder, we put our trash out on Sunday
[13:55.320 --> 13:58.160]  nights. And now before I take the trash out, I start the car
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.720]  up and drive it around the block. That's good. That's
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.560]  smart. Okay, cuz cuz it's funny that I had, it just feels like
[14:04.560 --> 14:07.760]  busy work. It's the worst busy work. Oh, totally. Well, the
[14:07.760 --> 14:09.760]  Jeep that I had when I was in high school that I didn't drive
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.200]  my friend's drove, ran into that same problem where it wouldn't
[14:13.200 --> 14:15.680]  be started or used for a while. And that was like, actually the
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.120]  impetus between my parents, like letting my friends like, drive
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.280]  my car, was that they were like, it's, it's just going to sit
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.360]  here. And, you know, it's, the battery will die, die, die. So
[14:27.400 --> 14:30.360]  you know, it's like, this needs to be driven, you're not going
[14:30.360 --> 14:33.360]  to drive it. If your friend Kelly wants to drive it, if, if
[14:33.360 --> 14:35.640]  your boyfriend Ben wants to drive it, if you know, other
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.280]  people want to drive it, like they can. I was like, Okay,
[14:38.320 --> 14:40.960]  fine. Awesome. Long as I don't have to drive it.
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.960]  All right, let me take a break here before we start the meat of
[14:43.960 --> 14:47.600]  the show. Thank our first sponsor. Oh, my goodness.
[14:47.600 --> 14:50.840]  Thank our first sponsor. Oh, I'm so glad to have these folks
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.960]  back as a sponsor. Mac Weldon. Mac Weldon makes clothes they
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.240]  believe in smart design, premium fabric, simple shopping. I own a
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.440]  whole bunch of Mac Weldon products. I really do. I love
[15:04.440 --> 15:07.120]  them. They're I think they started with underwear. I know
[15:07.120 --> 15:09.000]  that's what they're best known for. They do. They're great
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.560]  underwear, great socks, shirts, unders, undershirts, that sort
[15:12.560 --> 15:15.880]  of thing. But they've expanded all sorts of other stuff.
[15:15.880 --> 15:18.520]  They've got sweatpants, hoodies, all sorts of stuff like that.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.400]  And it's just it's really high quality. If you listen to ATP,
[15:23.400 --> 15:25.680]  you know, Marco wears all of this all the time, but they got
[15:25.680 --> 15:28.240]  like the silver line of underwear that are naturally
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.000]  anti microbial, microbial, but what a mouthful. But anyway,
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.160]  what it means is that it's a it's like scientifically designed
[15:36.160 --> 15:39.440]  fabric that eliminates odor. And it's I think it's true. I really
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.000]  don't think it's BS. I think it's really true. It's great
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.520]  stuff. Very comfortable, stylish, great to buy. Here's
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.960]  the reason I'm so glad to have these guys as a sponsor months
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.480]  ago, maybe seven, eight, nine months ago, it was before the
[15:52.480 --> 15:55.800]  end times. Merlin man was on the show and I was telling him about
[15:55.800 --> 16:00.440]  my favorite slippers, which are from Mack Weldon. And I showed
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.720]  them to him right there on the show he and he instantly got it.
[16:05.240 --> 16:07.720]  Because the big debate with slippers is where they have an
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.400]  open back or closed back like a shoe. I don't like an open back.
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.600]  I don't like it because then it feels like your slippers are
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.800]  ready to fly off your feet at any time you come down the
[16:16.800 --> 16:19.320]  stairs, you got like, how can you walk around the house with
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.360]  with slippers that are ready to fly off your feet, you might
[16:21.360 --> 16:24.880]  kill yourself. They've got but but Mack Weldon's back is not
[16:24.880 --> 16:29.000]  like a full back, where you have to like put on, sit down and put
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.480]  on your slippers. It's just enough that you can put them on
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.000]  without ever touching with your hands, your feet go right in,
[16:35.040 --> 16:38.360]  but there's a little thing in the back locks it in. Also, the
[16:38.360 --> 16:41.360]  most comfortable slippers I've ever owned. They're so great.
[16:41.360 --> 16:45.560]  Merlin and I talked about them. They sold out. They sold out.
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.600]  And what better proof that they should be sponsoring the show
[16:49.600 --> 16:52.120]  that wasn't even a sponsorship. I was just talking about
[16:52.120 --> 16:54.400]  slippers. They didn't even pay me to say it. I'm telling you
[16:54.400 --> 16:58.120]  right now if you need slippers and quite frankly, what a better
[16:58.120 --> 17:00.960]  time what better time to invest in slippers to wear around the
[17:00.960 --> 17:03.200]  house than nine months ago before all this started. I
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.680]  haven't worn anything. Most days, I would say 90% of the
[17:06.680 --> 17:09.800]  days since this whole thing started. I haven't worn anything
[17:09.800 --> 17:12.800]  but Mack Weldon slippers. They're fantastic. Get the
[17:12.800 --> 17:17.800]  slippers. You trust me, you'll thank me for it. Anyway, they
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.240]  also have a rewards program now called Weldon Blue level one
[17:21.240 --> 17:24.280]  gets you free shipping for life, which is pretty awesome. Once
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.280]  you reach level two, all you have to do is spend 200 bucks.
[17:27.640 --> 17:31.360]  And once you reach that level, you start getting 20% off every
[17:31.360 --> 17:35.000]  order for the next year. Serious savings. Anyway, love their
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.640]  products. Seriously, buy the slippers. Let's sell them out
[17:37.640 --> 17:42.360]  again. Show them what we can do. Go to mackweldon.com slash

[17:55.200 --> 17:57.920]  get 20% off your first order. So it's like you're already in the
[17:57.920 --> 18:05.440]  loyalty club. Anyway, great, great. I love their stuff. I
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.080]  I still got the first pair of slippers. I got holes in the
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.720]  soles now. I swear to God, that's all I wear.
[18:13.040 --> 18:15.560]  Good for these times, right? All right, here's the new thing. I
[18:15.560 --> 18:17.840]  just I don't know what order to go through the list. But we
[18:17.840 --> 18:20.560]  might as well start with what's fresh on my brain. You put it on
[18:20.560 --> 18:25.400]  the show notes with the the G four cube 20 years ago. Steve
[18:25.400 --> 18:28.360]  Jobs introduced the G four cube. You know, it's funny. I just
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.560]  posted I just had to show with my last guest was Adam Lisa
[18:31.560 --> 18:35.520]  Gore. And he mentioned the G four cube, not because it's the
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.560]  20 year anniversary, but just as an example of a Steve Jobs
[18:39.600 --> 18:44.440]  keynote. That gives him goosebumps in terms of the sort
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.920]  of difference the evolution of Apple keynotes from the Steve
[18:48.920 --> 18:54.120]  Jobs era to where we've gotten today. Yeah. And I remember that
[18:54.120 --> 18:56.960]  one. Yeah, I watched it again. And it's funny because you
[18:56.960 --> 18:59.240]  watch those old ones from 20 years ago. And it's like the
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.680]  only copies are like, I don't quite think they are VHS. But
[19:03.680 --> 19:08.280]  they're like the user SD. Yeah, well, but it's like bad SD.
[19:08.320 --> 19:14.200]  It's it's it's it's really low bit rate audio. You know, it's
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.400]  like worse than just 480 p. You know, right. I don't know how to
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.520]  describe it. Technically, there's the compression
[19:20.520 --> 19:24.960]  artifacts are pretty significant. But it's still
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.520]  it's, you know, you still it. I wonder if you've never seen it
[19:28.520 --> 19:31.960]  before. If you don't remember watching it when it was new,
[19:32.200 --> 19:35.120]  whether it would give you the feels like like it does if you
[19:35.120 --> 19:40.040]  knew but it's it really was a great introduction. I think it's
[19:40.040 --> 19:44.920]  a product that gets a bad rap. Anyway, Steven Levy today
[19:44.960 --> 19:47.920]  published a piece in Wired on the 20 year anniversary of it
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.640]  and talking about a private briefing he had with Steve Jobs
[19:51.640 --> 19:57.080]  before the announcement. And then I wrote about it. What were
[19:57.080 --> 19:58.680]  your thoughts? Why did you put it in the show notes? I'm
[19:58.680 --> 20:01.160]  curious. Yeah, well, I thought it was kind of interesting what
[20:01.160 --> 20:04.920]  you were saying about how, you know, Steve Jobs had the ability
[20:04.920 --> 20:09.840]  to go back on his decisions and kind of like rethink things and
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.160]  say, okay, which, you know, you drew the allusions to the App
[20:13.160 --> 20:16.440]  Store. And basically, I thought that was really interesting.
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.520]  Also, I don't know, I love the design of the cube. I always
[20:19.520 --> 20:23.000]  will. My one takeaway is we had we had one in my high school,
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.240]  and it caught on fire. And I was editing something and it caught
[20:29.240 --> 20:33.760]  on fire. And are you serious? I'm dead serious. I'm dead
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.360]  serious. Like it started smoking and then like, continued
[20:37.360 --> 20:40.120]  smoking. I don't I don't know if there were ever like big flames,
[20:40.120 --> 20:43.440]  but it definitely like, killed itself killed my project and
[20:43.440 --> 20:46.120]  that distinctive smell of burning electron Oh, my God, a
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.360]  burning a burning like components and plastic. And I
[20:50.360 --> 20:52.480]  mean, because you used to see the cracks in them. And even if
[20:52.480 --> 20:55.200]  you can buy them now, like all of them have cracks and stress
[20:55.200 --> 20:59.440]  stuff. And you know, it was bad. It was really, really bad. It
[20:59.440 --> 21:03.480]  filled the entire, you know, media lab with smoke, it was
[21:03.520 --> 21:08.520]  kind of a disaster. And that's my one, like, the very clear
[21:08.520 --> 21:11.720]  memory of the cube was it was so beautiful. And I was like, and
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.840]  it caught on fire, which I think, you know, if the
[21:15.840 --> 21:18.440]  thermals were notoriously bad, I think the design obviously,
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.400]  what happened there was kind of a precursor to where things
[21:22.400 --> 21:27.240]  were going. And, and was certainly in a lot of ways, like
[21:27.320 --> 21:31.000]  set the tone for, you know, small form factor PCs, things
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.120]  like the Mac Mini, and even the miniaturization of just tech in
[21:34.120 --> 21:37.640]  general. But yeah, there there were problems been and I do
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.800]  think it's kind of admirable that he didn't just continue
[21:42.800 --> 21:45.960]  added, he just kind of admitted, all right, you know what, let's
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.400]  let's just scrap it and try something different. Try it,
[21:49.400 --> 21:53.080]  maybe try it again later if we can, but like, let's not
[21:53.080 --> 21:55.480]  continue to even though I think that this design is beautiful in
[21:55.480 --> 21:58.000]  the future, if it's not working, it's not working. Honestly,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.440]  even more than the App Store, I think about like the keyboard.
[22:01.040 --> 22:05.280]  Like, I hate the whole notion of Oh, this never would have
[22:05.280 --> 22:07.520]  happened under Steve because there were plenty of things that
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.440]  happened under Steve that people would use. Now it's like, oh,
[22:11.440 --> 22:14.000]  that wouldn't have happened. But I do feel like the keyboard
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  wouldn't, it wouldn't have been three years.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.440]  Yeah. My analogy in that I liken it to much sure which card
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.920]  game but you know, like, you think about like Uno. And it's
[22:27.920 --> 22:30.800]  like, if you've got like a draw for you want to keep that,
[22:30.800 --> 22:35.120]  right? You keep that draw for card, you know, and the idea
[22:35.120 --> 22:37.760]  isn't that you never play it, right? You got your plan to win
[22:37.760 --> 22:41.040]  and it's like the these Steve Jobs never would have done this
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.480]  card as a pundit or just commentator on Twitter. It's
[22:44.480 --> 22:47.920]  like, you should be really conservative with it and keep
[22:47.920 --> 22:51.040]  that in your deck. Yeah, but it's not that doesn't mean you
[22:51.040 --> 22:54.040]  never play it. Right. And I think the keyboard is the
[22:54.040 --> 22:58.320]  keyboard issue with the MacBooks is a good example. It's, it is
[22:58.320 --> 23:02.560]  good. They did go back, they did redo it. And they did admit it
[23:02.560 --> 23:05.680]  as best that you could expect that. I mean, what do you want
[23:05.680 --> 23:07.520]  them to do? You know, they're not kind of like grovel in
[23:07.520 --> 23:10.520]  front of the world and say, you know, we really screwed up that
[23:10.520 --> 23:13.840]  keyboard. You know, they when they fixed it, they fixed it
[23:13.840 --> 23:18.200]  right. They really did. And it the question is, should it have
[23:18.200 --> 23:22.160]  taken three years? And I think the answer is no. And I do think
[23:22.160 --> 23:28.440]  that there's a sort of hubristic success breeds hubris. Of course
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.640]  it does. Right. And Apple has been extremely successful. So
[23:32.640 --> 23:35.320]  you really the more successful you are, the more you have to
[23:35.320 --> 23:40.680]  consciously really self consciously guard against
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.560]  succumbing to hubris. I think I think that's true of anything in
[23:44.560 --> 23:45.600]  life, big or small.
[23:46.320 --> 23:49.240]  No, I think you're right. And I think that that's actually why
[23:49.280 --> 23:52.720]  so oftentimes, and it's not just Apple, it's any big company,
[23:52.720 --> 23:55.480]  it's any successful person, you do have to keep yourself in
[23:55.480 --> 23:59.280]  check. Because if you don't, you will miss the next coming
[23:59.280 --> 24:02.280]  thing. I think that's sometimes why, why some people and
[24:02.280 --> 24:06.720]  companies and things miss trends is they just don't see it coming
[24:06.720 --> 24:09.240]  because they're not constantly asking those questions. And I
[24:09.240 --> 24:12.600]  think it's also one of those things where you have to, there's
[24:12.600 --> 24:16.880]  this weird, like, I guess, feedback loop where if you are
[24:16.880 --> 24:19.920]  so successful, and if what you're doing is continuing to
[24:19.920 --> 24:25.120]  get you not just applause and people cheering for you, but
[24:25.120 --> 24:27.800]  also tons and tons and tons of money, people are like voting
[24:27.800 --> 24:31.960]  financially with it, that I can understand that that creates
[24:32.120 --> 24:34.720]  some sort of dissonance of asking questions, is this the
[24:34.720 --> 24:37.880]  right thing or not? But I think to your point, it's important
[24:37.880 --> 24:40.920]  that you still do that. And I think it's even more important
[24:40.920 --> 24:43.640]  that if you start to hear even if it's small, comparatively, if
[24:43.640 --> 24:46.760]  you start to hear the same rumors and the same type of, you
[24:46.760 --> 24:50.080]  know, feedback or critiques, or in some cases, just outright,
[24:50.080 --> 24:53.640]  like outrage, like this is bad over and over again, like, it's
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.160]  important to, if you can, to try to listen to that and take
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.480]  action on that. Because that's usually indicative that
[25:01.480 --> 25:04.360]  something big is happening. Like when when the outline article
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.920]  went out about the keyboard, and that wasn't the first thing
[25:06.920 --> 25:08.480]  that had happened, but it was certainly kind of like the
[25:08.480 --> 25:11.040]  catalyst. I think that that would be
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.400]  Casey Johnson's. Yes, excellent, excellent piece.
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.000]  Yeah, exactly. And I think that that was definitely the thing
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.400]  that set things in motion to me. I don't know. I mean, I know
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.800]  that the design cycles and stuff takes a long time. But like, I
[25:24.800 --> 25:27.240]  don't know, to me, I feel like that would have been a moment
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.720]  where, like, at a company's best, that would be the sort of
[25:31.720 --> 25:33.920]  thing where you would go, okay, you know what, we need to
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.040]  regroup, because this is going to blow up into something
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.360]  bigger. And even if it doesn't become what it became, this is
[25:41.360 --> 25:43.640]  representative of something not being right. And we need to
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.960]  reassess, is this actually the best thing? Or, like, rather
[25:47.960 --> 25:51.360]  than taking the approach of, you know, having on-background
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.000]  meetings with reporters to tell them how small the actual
[25:55.040 --> 25:57.720]  replacement rates were, and things like that, you know,
[25:57.720 --> 26:00.000]  rather than kind of taking that approach, which frankly, I
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.240]  think, comes across to your users as disingenuous and ends
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.760]  up prolonging something. And, you know, I think both you and
[26:06.760 --> 26:10.360]  I commented on Jason Snell's Apple report card this year
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.360]  about the long-lasting negative impact that the keyboard will
[26:15.360 --> 26:19.600]  have. And I frankly worry about that. Like, they have fixed it,
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.760]  and it is good. But it's so much harder to win people back
[26:24.960 --> 26:27.560]  than it is to go in that other direction, right? Like, when
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.240]  you make a mistake or when you lose favor on something, it is
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.880]  so, so, so much harder to get people back on your side and to
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.120]  forget about that. And Apple, because they've had so much
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.200]  success, they haven't had to deal with something like that in
[26:42.200 --> 26:45.040]  a really long time. And, I mean, honestly, it was a much
[26:45.040 --> 26:48.120]  more minor thing. But you look at the way that iPhone 4 was
[26:48.120 --> 26:51.960]  handled and the Antennagate, they had the bumpers out. They
[26:51.960 --> 26:54.360]  had that program launched like ASAP.
[26:54.360 --> 27:01.480]  Well, the bumpers were, they debuted with the iPhone 4. So
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.480]  they didn't create the bumper in response. But what they did is
[27:04.480 --> 27:06.960]  they just said, here, we'll give everybody a bumper. We'll just
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.800]  get everybody, but you buy an iPhone 4, you get a bumper. And
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.720]  if you, and that's a good point. But still, but it's still,
[27:12.720 --> 27:15.320]  you're right, though. But I was, it's funny, though, you totally
[27:15.320 --> 27:18.280]  read my mind because I was going to bring up Antennagate as the,
[27:18.400 --> 27:21.440]  you know, the contrast with the keyboard thing. And the bumpers
[27:21.440 --> 27:24.000]  are fine. And the way, because they were trying to make money
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.120]  with the bumpers, like, so I feel like they kind of lucked
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.680]  into the bumper thing. So my theory on the bumper, and I
[27:31.680 --> 27:37.720]  think it's pretty transparently obvious, I would be, I think
[27:37.720 --> 27:42.880]  you'd be very hard pressed to come up with a counter argument
[27:42.880 --> 27:47.040]  that holds water. So here's my argument on the bumpers. So
[27:47.040 --> 27:54.520]  there's the iPhone, the iPhone 3G, and then the iPhone 3GS. And
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.000]  then the fourth year, they went to iPhone 4, which is kind of
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.440]  crazy. Like, that's, you know, in hindsight, like, if you go
[28:01.440 --> 28:04.880]  back, like, three years on iPhone, yeah, but you're still
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.600]  like, what, iPhone 10? It's like, mostly the same. Like,
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.880]  going from the original iPhone to the iPhone 4, in three years
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.960]  is pretty impressive. Because, you know, a totally different
[28:17.960 --> 28:21.960]  form factor totally, you know, went went from pre retina to
[28:21.960 --> 28:24.480]  retina, you know, there were only three iPhones that weren't
[28:24.480 --> 28:27.360]  retina, which is in hindsight, kind of crazy, because I still
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.680]  feel like half of the iPhone era was looking at the right, like
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.040]  fuzziness. Well, not only that, but it was not only retina, but
[28:36.040 --> 28:39.280]  front facing camera, which Oh, yeah, changer. Yeah. I mean,
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.040]  honestly, I think as much as retina, I would say the front
[28:42.040 --> 28:44.680]  facing camera is bigger, honestly, from an impact.
[28:45.160 --> 28:48.120]  Right. And the original one had a back facing camera that didn't
[28:48.120 --> 28:53.080]  shoot video. Imagine selling of imagine selling a put your
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.560]  finger on the idea that that the iPhone 12 years ago is a long
[28:56.560 --> 29:00.640]  time, right? Because we'll come back to this. But yeah, imagine
[29:00.640 --> 29:04.120]  selling a phone today where there is no front facing camera,
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.080]  period, and the back facing camera doesn't shoot video. So
[29:09.080 --> 29:12.800]  just put aside the quality of the back facing stills, because
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.640]  they were at least comparable to the other cameras of the time
[29:15.640 --> 29:18.160]  they were sure, you know, in line, but it didn't even shoot
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.760]  video. It's insane. And it just doesn't seem that long ago. But
[29:21.760 --> 29:25.440]  anyway, I think one of the things that happened in those
[29:25.600 --> 29:33.360]  crazy first 345 years of iPhone, where it went from, it just
[29:33.440 --> 29:36.960]  didn't exist seemed too good to be true to here we are, it's
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.000]  iPhone four, it's totally new design, it's gone from non
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.400]  retina to retina. But I think one of the things that happened
[29:44.600 --> 29:48.240]  around and they had this thing and it continued for a few years
[29:48.240 --> 29:53.640]  where each new iPhone for at least six or seven years, not
[29:53.640 --> 29:57.760]  only outsold all of the previous ones, but it outsold all of the
[29:57.760 --> 30:03.400]  previous ones combined. Yeah. So that was true past the iPhone
[30:03.400 --> 30:07.720]  four, but the three GS was so popular that it outsold the
[30:07.720 --> 30:12.200]  iPhone original and the three g combined. But I think one of the
[30:12.200 --> 30:15.960]  things that happened as it exploded in popularity and and
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.080]  clearly quickly went from the, you know, people who listen to
[30:21.080 --> 30:25.120]  the talk show, like me and you who waited in line for the
[30:25.120 --> 30:30.920]  original one to real people out in the world buying these was
[30:30.920 --> 30:35.080]  that everybody was putting them in cases. And they it clearly
[30:35.080 --> 30:39.640]  was not meant to be put in a case, but normal people buy a
[30:39.640 --> 30:43.760]  $700 phone, and they think I don't want to break the damn
[30:43.760 --> 30:46.880]  thing. I'm going to put it in a case. And I think the whole
[30:46.880 --> 30:49.800]  story of the bumpers is that Apple was like, Oh, my God,
[30:49.800 --> 30:53.960]  we've spent all this time making these things look good. And yeah,
[30:53.960 --> 30:57.360]  the three g and three GS don't look that great, because we went
[30:57.360 --> 31:00.600]  to this plastic back for antenna reasons and blah, blah, blah,
[31:00.600 --> 31:05.480]  but look, we've not only gone beaten that we've gone to this
[31:05.480 --> 31:10.480]  glass back steel side design with the iPhone four. That's
[31:10.480 --> 31:14.840]  really awesome. Apparently is more what they had in mind at
[31:14.840 --> 31:18.880]  the outset in 2005 2006 when they were developing the
[31:18.880 --> 31:22.800]  original iPhone all along. And in fact, according to rumors is
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.400]  where they're going later this year with next generation iPhone
[31:26.400 --> 31:31.120]  12. This sort of flat back flat side sort of aesthetic that we
[31:31.120 --> 31:35.480]  now see on the iPad Pro. It's a great look. It seems more
[31:35.480 --> 31:38.080]  timeless. You can see why they're going for it. And they
[31:38.120 --> 31:41.480]  they I think it's very clear. They thought Oh, my God, and
[31:41.480 --> 31:44.480]  everybody's gonna put it in a case. Yeah, right. And so they
[31:44.480 --> 31:48.040]  totally thought, why don't we if they just want to protect the
[31:48.040 --> 31:51.160]  damn thing? Well, how about we'll make and sell bumpers that
[31:51.160 --> 31:54.480]  leave the back open so you can see that place. It still looks
[31:54.480 --> 31:58.080]  nice. And you can feel it. You can see and feel this glass that
[31:58.080 --> 32:02.280]  we want you to see and feel because it's nice. That's the
[32:02.280 --> 32:05.400]  reason the bumpers existed. I think clearly, I agree with
[32:05.400 --> 32:08.240]  that. I agree with that. I think it's also telling that, you
[32:08.240 --> 32:11.960]  know, other than the battery cases, that the first cases that
[32:11.960 --> 32:18.000]  Apple really kind of embraced were very thin, you know, and
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.240]  now they have the clear cases, which I have on my 11 Pro Max.
[32:22.240 --> 32:27.120]  And I've gone back and forth. I've been a naked bone carrier,
[32:27.120 --> 32:30.520]  been a case person. Now it wouldn't matter to be totally
[32:30.520 --> 32:33.680]  honest, because I don't go anywhere. But, you know, there
[32:33.680 --> 32:36.640]  have been too many times when I've been like, okay, if this
[32:36.640 --> 32:38.880]  breaks, even though I have AppleCare, that's going to take
[32:38.880 --> 32:41.680]  time out of my day. And this is expensive. And now they're so
[32:41.680 --> 32:43.800]  expensive. I'm like, now I'm gonna I'm gonna put this in a
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.840]  case. But I think that that they follow the same sort of
[32:46.840 --> 32:48.640]  approach. They're like, okay, if we've made these beautiful
[32:48.640 --> 32:52.640]  designs, we want to do whatever the most minimal thing possible
[32:52.640 --> 32:54.280]  can be like, then, you know,
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  but then antenna gate happened. And they're like, well, we have
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.320]  the bumper and the bumper actually solves the whole
[33:00.320 --> 33:02.720]  attenuation problem if you have it, so we'll just give it to
[33:02.720 --> 33:05.120]  everybody. And then I think they ran away from bumpers
[33:05.120 --> 33:09.200]  permanently because bumpers became associated with Yeah,
[33:09.240 --> 33:10.120]  antenna gate.
[33:10.240 --> 33:12.880]  Oh, that's a great point. Oh, that's an excellent point.
[33:12.880 --> 33:15.560]  Because it would be interesting. Like now you could actually see
[33:15.560 --> 33:18.600]  I wouldn't mind if I had some sort of thing right bumper thing
[33:18.600 --> 33:21.200]  if that's I would actually like that. But I think you're exactly
[33:21.200 --> 33:23.320]  right. Because when I think bumper, the first thing I think
[33:23.320 --> 33:26.240]  is antenna gate, like that's there in explicit, like they're
[33:26.240 --> 33:27.680]  yeah, totally twined.
[33:28.360 --> 33:31.040]  I want to ask my theory. I don't know if it would work. I'm
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.280]  looking at the back of my iPhone 11. Now I don't know if a
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.960]  bumper would work with the camera cut out. Yeah, you might
[33:35.960 --> 33:39.360]  have to design a phone with the camera inset enough to
[33:39.360 --> 33:41.840]  accommodate it. I don't know. But the whole idea of bumper
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.280]  style cases has just gone away. I thought they were great. If
[33:45.280 --> 33:48.920]  you're going to and I actually knew, I knew way more people who
[33:48.920 --> 33:54.160]  used Apple bumpers with the iPhone four and four s, then who
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.400]  use Apple branded cases now, like almost nobody uses Apple
[33:59.400 --> 34:01.880]  branded cases, even though in my opinion, they're pretty nice
[34:01.880 --> 34:02.440]  cases.
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.600]  They're very nice. They're very nice. But they're expensive.
[34:04.640 --> 34:07.120]  And I think that's that's the big thing. They and they're
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.480]  expensive to the point where to be like totally candid. I don't
[34:10.480 --> 34:13.560]  think it's worth like, okay, it's $70 or something for the
[34:13.560 --> 34:18.520]  clear case for the pro max. I think a speaking case is going
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.800]  to be like 20. It's nicer than the speaking case. I don't think
[34:22.800 --> 34:27.040]  it's $50 nicer. So that makes it hard, I think for and for a lot
[34:27.040 --> 34:29.240]  of people, they won't even acknowledge that there's they
[34:29.240 --> 34:31.920]  won't even know that there's a difference, you know. So I think
[34:31.920 --> 34:34.520]  that's the that's the struggle. The leather cases, I feel the
[34:34.520 --> 34:37.720]  same way about the iPad. I'm so mad about my smart cover that I
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.480]  got from my 11 inch iPad Pro. That thing was so expensive, and
[34:41.480 --> 34:45.960]  it's probably the worst Apple cover case anything I've ever
[34:45.960 --> 34:48.880]  owned. And it's it's falling apart. I need a new one. But I
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.040]  also like an adamantly angry about having to spend that much
[34:54.040 --> 35:00.160]  money on this, you know, like magnet with like a flap.
[35:00.560 --> 35:07.920]  My wife has the 13 inch or 12.9 inch iPad Pro and that's not not
[35:07.920 --> 35:11.440]  not no keyboard cover. Just you know, just the cover cover. I
[35:11.440 --> 35:14.480]  don't. Yeah, the smart. Yeah, that's what I've got. I get so
[35:14.480 --> 35:17.000]  confused because it's like this the smart cover and the smart
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.200]  it's like what's smart about it. I don't know why they call it
[35:19.200 --> 35:22.680]  smart. Like the smartness keyboard is kind of smart
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.520]  because it's a keyboard but like a cover is kind of dumb, like
[35:26.520 --> 35:29.120]  not in a negative way. So I'm sure they're totally not
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.000]  advocating them recalling it the dumb cover. No, I think the
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.840]  reason they did originally was it the first ones had like the
[35:34.840 --> 35:38.440]  magnets ability right open, you could turn it on like when you
[35:38.440 --> 35:41.160]  would open it up. And so the ones that were like, like
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.080]  polyethylene or vinyl or whatever they would, you know,
[35:44.080 --> 35:46.840]  be able to kind of fold and she was stand. I think that was the
[35:46.840 --> 35:50.160]  big difference was that when you open it up, your iPad would turn
[35:50.160 --> 35:52.440]  on and when you closed it, it would turn off. It's the same
[35:52.440 --> 35:55.960]  way that I completely forget. Once it's two years out of date,
[35:55.960 --> 36:00.040]  I completely forget then which named version of Mac OS goes to
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.680]  which version number like yeah, like I do and I love it when
[36:03.680 --> 36:06.920]  they go and they do lion then mountain lion because I know
[36:06.920 --> 36:09.640]  mountain lion came after lion but damn if I could tell you
[36:09.640 --> 36:12.120]  what what number it was. I don't know, you know,
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.480]  yeah, all the cats. I know all the cats and it's when they get
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.280]  into like the the Sierra and high Sierra Mavericks and all
[36:20.280 --> 36:22.560]  that. So that's what I'm like, I don't know.
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.160]  I do know high Sierra came after Sierra. But yes, but
[36:26.160 --> 36:29.480]  anyway, I feel the same way with smart blank. But anyway, my
[36:29.480 --> 36:34.960]  wife's smart cover for iPad Pro looks like she picked it out of
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.720]  the trash. I mean, it is mine to get is frayed at the corners
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.720]  and, and every other thing she owns in her life, whether it is
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.920]  technical or Apple or I almost every other thing she owns from
[36:50.920 --> 36:58.280]  clothing to makeup to kick cooking, equip stuff, anything
[36:58.280 --> 37:02.480]  she owns or her weightlifting equipment and exercise equipment
[37:02.480 --> 37:07.080]  and her gym stuff. It all looks like she could send it back and
[37:07.080 --> 37:10.360]  get a refund as new even though she's been using it like she
[37:10.360 --> 37:14.160]  takes tremendous care of everything she owns. The iPad
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.080]  itself, again, looks like if you just, you know, wipe the
[37:18.080 --> 37:21.920]  fingerprints off the screen, you could take it back. But the
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.680]  cover it looks like she trash picked it. It's unbelievable. I
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.520]  don't understand how that how something so expensive could be
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.200]  so fragile. But anyway, anyway, well, it's a very short
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.680]  digression on the difference in how long it took them to address
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.200]  and tennegate and the keyboard. And boy that that and tennegate
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.480]  thing was very Steve Jobsian. And I wonder I do I often think
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.400]  about that. And I've thought about that. And it's like, what
[37:48.400 --> 37:51.440]  would happen if they had the something exactly analogous to
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.000]  and tennegate now would they address it as quickly as they
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.560]  did. It was truly one of the most extraordinary of all my
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.440]  time covering Apple, it was one of the most extraordinary things
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.680]  I've ever went through. And I'm so glad that I did I would have
[38:07.680 --> 38:11.240]  been if I had been like a couple years behind on getting into
[38:11.400 --> 38:15.640]  getting press passes and stuff like that for things like that.
[38:16.040 --> 38:19.000]  I would have been so you know, like before my time, like I
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.920]  wasn't there for like the original iPod introduction in
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.760]  2012 2001 after 911. And I always wish boy that would have
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.560]  been a good one like Jason Snow was there and it seems like that
[38:30.560 --> 38:35.560]  was a good event. Just into in the context of post 911 America
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.320]  and it was a small thing. Yeah, and sort of a device that came
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.400]  out of nowhere, but the antenna completely was so bizarre
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.960]  because it was like, trying to remember what day the week it
[38:45.960 --> 38:52.080]  happened. It was like, I want to say that that was I'm pretty
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.760]  sure that it was like, it might have even happened on like a
[38:55.760 --> 38:56.760]  Friday or something.
[38:56.760 --> 38:59.960]  Yeah, that's what I feel like it was really late. Yeah, because
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.920]  I remember so I was the first Apple event I ever actually got
[39:04.920 --> 39:08.600]  like a press credential to was for the iPhone four. And then my
[39:08.600 --> 39:11.080]  flight got in late and I wasn't able to go and I had to send
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.760]  someone else in my place. And then that person was rude at the
[39:15.760 --> 39:18.960]  antenna gate event the following week. And then that messed up my
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.840]  Apple relationship for like another two and a half years. So
[39:23.120 --> 39:25.920]  like it set me back and I was so pissed like like like yeah,
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.240]  well, I'm not gonna like put the guy on blast but if I did like
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.840]  people would understand like I totally I'm positive like I'd
[39:33.840 --> 39:36.720]  heard from other people. I was like, Yeah, I can completely
[39:36.720 --> 39:39.840]  believe that. And so that you know, the mess of my
[39:39.840 --> 39:43.400]  relationship then like for years like took me like effort to kind
[39:43.400 --> 39:47.720]  of claw back or whatever. And, but I remember like covering it
[39:47.720 --> 39:50.760]  and yeah, so the event happened and then the following week or
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.080]  maybe a few weeks later, whenever it shipped. Yeah, it
[39:55.080 --> 39:57.800]  was like late in the week was like a Thursday or Friday. And
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.240]  it was early the next week, when they had pivoted from the you're
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.840]  holding it wrong to having the the kind of emergency meeting
[40:07.920 --> 40:11.760]  and issuing everybody the free bumpers or credit if you'd
[40:11.760 --> 40:13.800]  already bought one, you know, you could get an Apple one or a
[40:13.800 --> 40:19.000]  third party one. And like, it's stunning, like it completely, it
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.720]  was so quick. And it totally I mean, they completely managed
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.960]  the situation in a way that like, not just comparing it to
[40:25.960 --> 40:28.440]  other Apple issues. But if you look at like, an obviously
[40:28.440 --> 40:31.080]  completely different level, like not even close, but when the
[40:31.240 --> 40:33.880]  when the note seven caught on fire, like speaking of things
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.000]  catching on fire, when that caught on fire, like Samsung was
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.640]  so slow to respond to that. And then it caught on fire the
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.600]  second time, like, obviously, the antenna gate, completely
[40:47.600 --> 40:50.240]  different thing apples to oranges, but they still
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.400]  responded so quickly that it was pretty incredible. Honestly, I
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.840]  can't imagine what other event it would have been. So it must
[40:56.840 --> 40:59.160]  have been antenna gate. And I don't know if it was a Friday or
[40:59.160 --> 41:02.240]  a Thursday or what. But it was like there was one day of the
[41:02.240 --> 41:07.720]  week where somebody from Apple PR called me and inquired about
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.240]  my availability, like maybe Monday. And I was like, Yeah,
[41:11.280 --> 41:13.960]  probably. And you know, and again, typical Apple PR wouldn't
[41:13.960 --> 41:18.040]  say what it was about, but it was sort of like, but also Apple
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.240]  PR, not really, you know, was over the phone. So there's no
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.000]  literal winking, but there is when you deal with them, they
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.600]  won't say anything that would confirm but there's also an
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.120]  acknowledgement that you know, that I know that we both know
[41:34.120 --> 41:40.480]  this is about the antenna thing. And they don't, you know, it I
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.280]  guess it's sort of not telling you what it's about, but also
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.000]  not gaslighting you about it. Right? There is sort of a Yeah,
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.680]  you know, like, we won't say it, but yeah. And then it was like a
[41:52.680 --> 41:55.840]  callback. And instead of like talking about Monday, it was
[41:55.840 --> 41:58.800]  like, could you be here tomorrow morning? And it was, you know,
[41:58.800 --> 42:01.440]  from Philadelphia, that's actually like, I don't know,
[42:01.440 --> 42:04.160]  that's hard. And I remember it because the thing that I
[42:04.160 --> 42:07.960]  remember is I flew an airline that I've never flown before or
[42:07.960 --> 42:12.760]  after probably the Delta or United like Delta and United are
[42:12.760 --> 42:15.800]  major airlines, but they have like, almost no presence in
[42:15.800 --> 42:20.280]  Philadelphia, everything's at the time was US Air now it's
[42:20.280 --> 42:25.280]  American. But at the time, also American when US Air and
[42:25.280 --> 42:27.640]  American were different, they were actually both pretty big in
[42:27.640 --> 42:31.880]  Philly and Southwest. And it was like the only flight, not the
[42:31.880 --> 42:35.520]  only way to get to San Francisco that night was like a United
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.200]  flight. It was like two in the afternoon, it was like a 430
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.320]  flight didn't actually cost that much. I guess it's sort of like
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.280]  that that whole game you play with last minute travel where
[42:48.280 --> 42:50.800]  it's like sometimes they'll they'll like charge you first
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.600]  cap class flight prices for the seat next to the toilet in the
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.000]  back of the plane. And other times they're like, Oh my god,
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.280]  you'll buy this an empty seat on this plane that's leaving in two
[43:02.280 --> 43:05.720]  hours. Sure. Here's 400 bucks. And it's like, Oh, that's not
[43:05.720 --> 43:08.840]  bad. You know, and like, it right like the price wasn't a
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.920]  problem. It was Can I can I pack a bag and get there?
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.640]  Right? It's like, it's like, is there enough time? Right. And I
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.960]  just checked. It was actually 10 years ago last week, the time
[43:20.960 --> 43:23.920]  that it changed was July 12, when Consumer Reports, which was
[43:23.920 --> 43:26.760]  a Monday and Consumer Reports basically said that it couldn't
[43:26.760 --> 43:29.680]  recommend the iPhone for because of the antenna issues. And then
[43:29.680 --> 43:32.960]  they had the event on the 16th, which would have been a Friday.
[43:32.960 --> 43:35.760]  So it was a Friday. So it was like, it was Thursday, and I
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.360]  didn't. So I got the call like, Philadelphia time, like two in
[43:39.360 --> 43:41.920]  the afternoon, like, hey, we're gonna do it. We're gonna have a
[43:41.920 --> 43:47.160]  thing tomorrow morning. I was on like a 415 United flight to
[43:47.160 --> 43:50.600]  SFO, you know, and I pack light and I live close to the airport.
[43:50.600 --> 43:53.400]  So actually, I remember it was actually wasn't even hectic. It
[43:53.400 --> 43:57.560]  was like, it wasn't even like, I'm, oh, God is how old I am OJ
[43:57.560 --> 44:02.480]  Simpson running down the airport terminal. You know, it was like
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.800]  casual, but it was like, all of a sudden, I'm like, you know, on
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.520]  an airplane to California and two and a half hours before I
[44:09.520 --> 44:13.600]  thought I was, you know, sitting at home. But it was that quick,
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.680]  that fast. And it's sort of, you know, not that they were winging
[44:18.680 --> 44:21.560]  it, but that they literally at the last minute, you know, and
[44:21.560 --> 44:25.360]  again, would Apple do this today impossible to it's really hard
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.840]  to conceive that they would that they opened the event with
[44:27.840 --> 44:32.520]  Jonathan Mann's iPhone for antenna song, which in jobs was
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.640]  dancing to it, which is so great. Like there was a little
[44:34.640 --> 44:38.000]  moment where you could like see him dancing to if you don't like
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.680]  it, don't buy it. Like, if you don't buy it, and I, I don't
[44:42.680 --> 44:46.280]  think john I've, I've spoken to Jonathan man several times about
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.280]  it. It was a huge thrill for him. They did get his permission.
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.280]  It was and again, very last minute, it was like they got a
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.600]  hold of him somehow. And we're like, Hey, can we can we would
[44:56.600 --> 44:59.200]  you sign this thing that says we can use this song and he's like,
[44:59.200 --> 45:02.400]  what serious what still had no idea what he was like, of
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.120]  course, here, whatever you need. And then to find out that they
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.080]  opened the event with it, he had no idea. All he knew is that
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.440]  he'd given them permission to use it. And it's because the
[45:11.440 --> 45:16.640]  song expressed what they wanted to say, which Steve wanted to
[45:16.640 --> 45:23.000]  say, in a friendly, funny, this is all a big joke way. But the
[45:23.280 --> 45:30.520]  the lyrics, if you don't want it, don't buy it. It's almost
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.480]  like I almost feel like jobs. I wanted to say you know what, we
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.240]  actually had a thing to tell you about but that song actually
[45:37.240 --> 45:42.520]  says it also. There you go. Here's a free bumper. Anyway,
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.320]  but it was different. And it did nip it in the bud in a way. But
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.400]  it does go to the so I think they dealt with it very
[45:51.400 --> 45:54.480]  effectively. I think it is a textbook example that you could
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.560]  do not just a lecture on but an entire note of course in public
[45:59.560 --> 46:00.320]  relations.
[46:00.480 --> 46:04.200]  No, it's it's like bear or Tylenol or whoever. Yeah, it was
[46:04.200 --> 46:07.120]  super. It's one of those levels. And obviously, again, the stakes
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.640]  are completely different. I know we want to equate right people
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.760]  dying because people were, you know, poisoning medicine with
[46:15.720 --> 46:19.000]  you know, your sign attenuation on Yeah, that sign idea with
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.520]  attenuation on your phone, but you're completely right. Like
[46:22.520 --> 46:25.080]  this, if it's, I'm now it's been a decade, I'm sure it's being
[46:25.080 --> 46:27.480]  taught in business schools. Like, I'd be shocked about PR
[46:27.480 --> 46:31.160]  school, you know, totally how to do public relations. And it
[46:31.160 --> 46:34.080]  actually would make a good back to back thing with the Tylenol
[46:34.080 --> 46:37.280]  where here's here's high stakes life and death, but only like 10
[46:37.280 --> 46:40.960]  people and they actually, you know, they actually knew, which
[46:40.960 --> 46:44.560]  in and that's, that's sort of the a B scenario that makes it
[46:44.560 --> 46:47.200]  so different. So you've got a totally different thing in the
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.920]  stakes where one was, there really were people who bought a
[46:51.920 --> 46:54.440]  handful of people, but they really did buy containers of
[46:54.440 --> 46:57.840]  Tylenol that were laced with cyanide. So that's a real life
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.920]  and death issue. Can't stakes don't go any higher. And then
[47:00.920 --> 47:03.680]  you're, you know, yeah, we're talking about iPhone attenuation
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.680]  and it wasn't like your phone couldn't make phone calls, you
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.240]  know, unless you lived on a somewhere where you had really
[47:10.240 --> 47:12.840]  sketchy service to begin with. It's like, come on, right? It's
[47:12.840 --> 47:19.320]  not it. Totally. But it was, it was a big contrast in how many
[47:19.320 --> 47:22.720]  people were affected. Tylenol knew exactly which vials had the
[47:22.720 --> 47:25.800]  cyanide. They really didn't. They wasn't like they took it
[47:25.800 --> 47:29.320]  all off the shelves because they weren't sure they knew exactly
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.200]  which ones you know that the crew could did this had access
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.440]  to, you know, if you just look at all of the end, it's not like
[47:36.440 --> 47:39.320]  a new thing. Even back in the 80s. They had numbers on the
[47:39.320 --> 47:41.680]  bottom of the thing that told them which ones were packed on
[47:41.680 --> 47:44.160]  which day and stuff like that. But they just did that for the
[47:44.160 --> 47:47.640]  public relations. Whereas the iPhone attenuation issue wasn't
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.400]  just a bad batch of 10 iPhones. It was endemic to the design of
[47:51.400 --> 47:52.160]  the iPhone 4.
[47:53.080 --> 47:58.040]  Yeah, no, exactly. And, you know, but yeah, so it affected
[47:58.040 --> 48:00.280]  everyone's and they obviously couldn't do the thing. They're
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.680]  not going to recall the phone. But coming up with a way to
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.040]  mitigate it and handle it. And yeah, I agree with you, I think
[48:07.040 --> 48:09.600]  that it, it largely was successful. I mean, there were
[48:09.600 --> 48:11.840]  people who would still kind of make the cracks and whatnot.
[48:11.840 --> 48:14.640]  But I interestingly in the similar thing happened with
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.840]  Ben Gate, which was much smaller, where what happened
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.080]  would be that people would test other phones, which in some ways
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.800]  gives Apple like clearance, because then you're not alone,
[48:24.800 --> 48:27.800]  right? So it's like, okay, this other phone has this issue to
[48:27.800 --> 48:31.920]  just like this other phone, if you are purposefully bending it,
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.080]  I'm rolling my eyes, and you know, is going to going to
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.160]  break. So that that's the that's the I guess, was the good thing
[48:41.160 --> 48:43.720]  for them is that any long lasting damage because they
[48:43.720 --> 48:46.560]  handled it so quickly. I think they had a lot of cover because
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.600]  everybody was testing every phone at that point, not just
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.200]  iPhones.
[48:50.240 --> 48:55.320]  Yeah. Which brings us to my point, which is why why not
[48:55.320 --> 48:58.560]  pull a Steve Jobs with the App Store stuff?
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.360]  Yeah, I agree. And I wonder if part of it is that hubris thing
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.280]  you talk about, they've been so successful. And they've kind of
[49:07.280 --> 49:10.480]  created this market that other people have followed. I mean,
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.400]  they weren't the first digital market, but they with iTunes,
[49:14.400 --> 49:17.360]  definitely the first substantial one. And, you know, their
[49:17.360 --> 49:20.800]  their commission model has been, you know, copied by everyone.
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.520]  But they're the criticisms that have been lobbied against them
[49:25.520 --> 49:28.960]  by by developers been happening for years. And it's just
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.520]  building and building and building. And I wonder if it's
[49:32.520 --> 49:35.400]  the hubris of we've been so successful, and we continue to
[49:35.400 --> 49:38.400]  generate so much more revenue that blinds people from seeing
[49:38.400 --> 49:40.920]  that. And then there's a really cynical part of me that also
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.440]  thinks revenue is now the thing that is driving growth of the
[49:44.440 --> 49:47.280]  company or not revenue services are now the thing that are
[49:47.280 --> 49:50.040]  driving growth of the company. So it's no longer phone sales,
[49:50.040 --> 49:52.760]  it was phone sales and hardware sales for many, many, many, many
[49:52.760 --> 49:56.440]  years. That's no longer what's driving the company growth, the
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.120]  only way the company continues to grow is if it is, which is
[50:00.120 --> 50:02.160]  what Wall Street wants. Now, whether it needs to grow or not,
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.160]  I think is a different question. But if the company is going to
[50:05.160 --> 50:08.520]  continue to grow the way that Wall Street wants, their one
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.640]  real avenue is to increase services. And that's why we've
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.960]  seen this tremendous, tremendous, like, like push of
[50:15.960 --> 50:18.960]  services, whether it's putting, you know, different like ads in
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.280]  your in the wallet app. And, you know, trying to encourage
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.560]  people to upsell to either, you know, Apple Music, if you have
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.960]  Apple Music, buy a family plan. I'm like, I don't have anybody
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.720]  else in a family account. Like, why? Why are you showing me
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.160]  that, you know, to Apple News Plus and whatnot, they are
[50:37.160 --> 50:40.600]  they're really, really doubling and tripling down on services.
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.200]  So I think the cynical part of me is that the people who might
[50:46.200 --> 50:50.720]  be arguing that Apple go back and kind of had the Steve Jobs
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.560]  moment and revisit things are being talked over by the people
[50:55.560 --> 50:59.480]  who are like, okay, but if we do that, we potentially lose this
[50:59.480 --> 51:03.320]  much money, which we need to continue to show growth.
[51:04.160 --> 51:07.920]  There's a lot to unpack there. That was absolutely excellent. I
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.160]  can't believe that came out extemporaneously that you could
[51:11.160 --> 51:17.840]  just like to transcribe that posted. I let's actually put it
[51:17.840 --> 51:20.280]  but that's so good. And there's so much to unpack. Let's put a
[51:20.280 --> 51:22.720]  put a finger on it because we'll come right back to it. And let
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.560]  me just take a break here. And thank our next sponsor good
[51:25.560 --> 51:28.760]  friends at Squarespace. Oh, Squarespace. Look, we're all
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.360]  locked up. We're inside. It's like it's like New Year's all
[51:33.400 --> 51:36.880]  year long where you have time to do like resolution type stuff.
[51:37.320 --> 51:40.120]  But instead of not doing it in this sort of forgetting about it,
[51:40.120 --> 51:42.600]  why not? Why not take take this summer, you're not going
[51:42.600 --> 51:47.240]  anywhere. If you're not going anywhere, why not get that to do
[51:47.240 --> 51:50.720]  to do off your list of like a website you wanted to build or
[51:50.720 --> 51:54.760]  maybe an old website you wanted to upgrade, make it modern, get
[51:54.760 --> 51:57.720]  it get get all this stuff that you don't need to worry about.
[51:57.800 --> 52:01.040]  Like, like is your server running the right operating
[52:01.040 --> 52:04.240]  system? Do you have software updates that are like security
[52:04.240 --> 52:06.480]  vulnerabilities, stuff like that. You don't want to deal
[52:06.480 --> 52:09.760]  with that if you just want to have a website. Squarespace is
[52:09.760 --> 52:13.480]  an all in one platform that absolves you of all that stuff
[52:13.480 --> 52:19.040]  you don't want to deal with like operating system and server
[52:19.040 --> 52:23.800]  upgrades and security updates, and does give you everything you
[52:23.800 --> 52:28.080]  do want, which is control over what is on your website, what
[52:28.080 --> 52:31.640]  it's called, including domain name registration, what it looks
[52:31.640 --> 52:36.840]  like, and the design, it gives you complete control over it. If
[52:36.840 --> 52:40.200]  you want to be a nerd and do it like by tweaking CSS and writing
[52:40.200 --> 52:43.240]  JavaScript, you can do it. And if you just want to do it pure
[52:43.240 --> 52:49.320]  WYSIWYG and drag stuff around. They've got it. Also, one of my
[52:49.320 --> 52:54.400]  favorite analytics panels I've ever seen. Just fantastic in
[52:54.400 --> 52:58.000]  terms of showing you who's looking at your website, where
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.880]  are they coming from? What's popular? What's going on? And
[53:01.880 --> 53:05.600]  it's not just like a data dump. It is like an actual dashboard
[53:05.600 --> 53:08.280]  dashboard that gives you important information in a well
[53:08.280 --> 53:11.280]  designed way really underrated part of the whole Squarespace
[53:11.280 --> 53:16.240]  experience. Go there, do it, you get a free trial 30 days, all
[53:16.240 --> 53:20.480]  for real, not like with like a big, you know, Squarespace trial
[53:20.480 --> 53:23.120]  watermark stamped on your site. No, it's for real, you could
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.040]  just like get started, don't even pay, spend 30 days getting
[53:27.040 --> 53:30.800]  it off the ground. Then when you like it, pay, go to
[53:30.800 --> 53:34.480]  squarespace.com slash talk show to get started, get that free
[53:34.480 --> 53:37.560]  trial going. And just remember that same code talk show when
[53:37.560 --> 53:40.200]  you do pay when your free trial is over, you get 10% off your
[53:40.200 --> 53:42.520]  first purchase, and you can do it for a whole year at once save
[53:42.520 --> 53:45.600]  10% on a whole year, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[53:46.960 --> 53:56.560]  So yeah, let's unpack this bit by bit. So one way to do it is,
[53:56.920 --> 54:01.520]  and what I'm saying, and so there's the the App Store angle,
[54:01.800 --> 54:06.520]  and then there's the services growth angle. And and to me,
[54:06.520 --> 54:11.080]  that's one way of just forking this whole discussion. Two ways
[54:11.240 --> 54:14.280]  and yes, they do come together. They're not, you know,
[54:14.320 --> 54:18.000]  completely unrelated because a lot of what people are
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.920]  complaining about and on the laundry list of things some
[54:20.920 --> 54:23.720]  people want to see changed at the App Store is the issue of
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.000]  Apple's 30% commission and the rules over which apps and for
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.600]  which reasons have to use the in app purchases to go through
[54:32.600 --> 54:36.640]  commerce. And Apple gets 30% of that and it's a lot of money and
[54:36.640 --> 54:40.040]  it all counts as quote unquote services and services is their
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.560]  narrative growth their their narrative to Wall Street of how
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.040]  we're the company's growing. It's the division that we break
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.800]  out, we being Apple breakout that is growing. So I get it,
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.760]  they're not unrelated, but I think we can kind of unpack them
[54:55.760 --> 54:59.120]  separately. Right? So what are the things? What's the list of
[54:59.120 --> 55:04.440]  things some people would like to see changed at the App Store? One
[55:04.440 --> 55:09.800]  of them is the 3070 split that turns to 8515 for a subscription
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.320]  after a year, and some people would like to see Apple charge
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.640]  less than 30% at least to start, you know, like, for example, you
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.840]  could say, what if you started 8515 and then subscriptions go
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.240]  to seven and a half percent after a year or something like
[55:26.240 --> 55:30.640]  that, or just 8515 and that's it a you know, yeah, just skip
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.840]  right to the 8515 and keep it there. Just go to the one year
[55:33.840 --> 55:40.040]  mark and do everything 8515. There's that there's the you
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.840]  can't use other payment stuff. You can't just say, Well, I'm
[55:45.840 --> 55:48.360]  not using your in app purchase. I'll just take the credit card
[55:48.360 --> 55:51.920]  in my app to turn it from the free trial to the full version.
[55:51.920 --> 55:58.040]  Right? Then there's the outside thing, which I like to call the
[55:58.040 --> 56:02.080]  Netflix rule, right? So you download Netflix, Netflix is on
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.680]  your phone and you launch it and it says what's your email and
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.800]  password to sign into Netflix. And if you have one, you sign it
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.800]  in and then you're using Netflix. And if you don't, you
[56:13.800 --> 56:16.480]  have to figure out on your own, you have to go to Netflix, sign
[56:16.480 --> 56:21.920]  up, pay them there, then come back and do it. That's where the
[56:21.920 --> 56:27.840]  whole hey, email thing blew up, because that's what the base
[56:27.840 --> 56:31.720]  camp company is doing with base camp and has been doing for a
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.360]  while. Very successful product, you know, that's been around for
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.200]  years, but their their iOS app strategy is that they have an
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.360]  app that you download and you launch it and it says what's
[56:43.360 --> 56:46.840]  your base camp email and password. And if you don't have
[56:46.840 --> 56:49.160]  one, you kind of have to go figure it out. But then they
[56:49.160 --> 56:51.400]  collect all the money on this side, they do it like Netflix,
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.360]  they assume they could do the same thing with Hey, their email
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.600]  app and service. Because there are in fact, that's because a,
[56:59.600 --> 57:01.920]  that's what they did with base camp B, that's what apps like
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.480]  Netflix, etc, do. And see, that's what other email apps
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.120]  even do specifically email. And then they found out from Apple
[57:10.120 --> 57:12.440]  that no, we would, you know, if you want to be in the App Store,
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.560]  you've got to have an option to sign up in the app, which would
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.880]  give Apple the 70 30 split for the first year and then 85 15
[57:21.880 --> 57:27.320]  thereafter. What else people want side loading, they want you
[57:27.320 --> 57:31.280]  to be able to what if you could shoot your iPhone and like a Mac
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.280]  where you can just if if you don't like the deal, you could
[57:34.280 --> 57:37.720]  just go to hey.com and download their app and install it on your
[57:37.720 --> 57:42.040]  phone separately, not going through the store. So sure, you
[57:42.040 --> 57:43.880]  can do whatever you want with your store, but let us go
[57:43.880 --> 57:47.000]  outside the store. And, you know, even have that off by
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.640]  default, like the Mac with all that, what do they call it?
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.080]  Gatekeeper? Yeah, Gatekeeper. So you know, on by default, only
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.120]  App Store only, then you'd go into settings and say turn off
[57:59.160 --> 58:02.040]  Gatekeeper and let me you know, and then there'd be a warning
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.440]  that says, you know, something hopefully not too alarmist, but
[58:06.440 --> 58:09.240]  act technically accurate description of the risks of
[58:09.280 --> 58:11.920]  turning it off, turn it off. And now you can install apps from
[58:11.920 --> 58:15.600]  app side of the App Store. People want them to allow rival
[58:15.600 --> 58:19.720]  app stores, which I guess if you had side load, well, no, maybe
[58:19.720 --> 58:21.440]  not. Actually, that would be separate.
[58:22.160 --> 58:24.240]  Yeah, it's a separate thing. They want an alternative
[58:24.240 --> 58:27.920]  distribution thing. So they want like someone like epic, or, you
[58:27.920 --> 58:30.600]  know, steam or someone like that to be able to have their own
[58:30.600 --> 58:35.000]  rules and store or specific things. Right. But just the
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.880]  reason I had to correct myself there is just allowing side
[58:37.880 --> 58:41.920]  loading through Gatekeeper would not necessarily would not allow
[58:42.360 --> 58:45.280]  you might think on your off the top of your head like I was
[58:45.280 --> 58:48.160]  thinking even though I know better. Well, if they allow you
[58:48.160 --> 58:52.280]  to install whatever you want, whatever you want might be a
[58:52.280 --> 58:56.480]  thing that's also an App Store. But that that the thing I was
[58:56.480 --> 58:59.160]  forgetting was that we even with Gatekeeper, you can be
[58:59.160 --> 59:02.640]  sandboxed. And the idea would be even with side loaded apps, they
[59:02.640 --> 59:05.920]  would still be sandboxed. And the sandbox is a technical
[59:05.920 --> 59:10.360]  thing, not a voluntary thing. And you would have to sign your
[59:10.360 --> 59:11.520]  app, you know,
[59:11.520 --> 59:13.120]  that's the thing where you would need to be signed, it would
[59:13.120 --> 59:15.000]  still need to go through me notarized
[59:15.040 --> 59:18.320]  and Apple could revoke your developer certificate to disable
[59:18.320 --> 59:21.280]  the app, even if it's not going through the App Store, if it was
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.320]  found to be malware or otherwise harmful or dangerous, etc,
[59:25.320 --> 59:31.440]  etc. So I think that's a basic list of the things and you know,
[59:31.440 --> 59:34.480]  some of them are about money and some of them are not but all of
[59:34.480 --> 59:38.400]  them, you might argue, at some degree would mean Apple's making
[59:38.400 --> 59:40.840]  less money from third party apps. And so therefore, it's a
[59:40.840 --> 59:45.400]  non starter. And I think that's foolish. I think it's it might
[59:45.400 --> 59:51.480]  be true. But basically, my argument, it comes down to not
[59:51.480 --> 59:59.280]  everything can have a dollar value. And and I think that if
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.760]  you're looking at the world, through Wall Street, Wall Street
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.440]  is sort of set up the whole idea of a stock price is to take the
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.040]  entirety of a company and these the companies that we're talking
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.840]  about, you know, like your apples and Microsoft's and
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.720]  Google's and even Facebook and these giant companies, it's very
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.920]  hard to encapsulate them into a very neat package, let alone one
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.680]  number. But that's what the idea of a stock price is that you
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.720]  take all of the complexity and the future, the entire future of
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.920]  a giant multinational corporation, and you assign a
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.640]  dollar value to to it, and you say that's what the company's
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.040]  worth. And that's what it would cost for you to buy a fractional
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.120]  share of the company. So what it is now, if to me, I'm not
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.320]  saying the stock market should be abolished. I'm not saying
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.880]  it's a bad idea. You know, it's it. That's not my argument. What
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.720]  I'm saying, though, is that that is one way of looking at it. It
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.200]  might be necessary, it is necessary to have publicly held
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.760]  corporations. But that doesn't actually encompass all of it.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.960]  It's like saying that, you know, a movie is what it makes at the
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.520]  box office. And therefore, the box out the best, you know,
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.400]  whichever movies make the most money are the best movies. Well,
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.160]  very few people would agree with that, even if their favorite
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.440]  three movies happen to be the three movies that made the most
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.160]  they'd still I think even those people would agree, well, that
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.320]  that's just, I happen to like blockbusters, or I like these
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.120]  blockbusters. I'm not arguing that that's a measure of the
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.840]  value of right movies. I mean, I mean, some Marvel fanboys and
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.920]  some like Lord of the Ring fanboys would would probably
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.360]  take that but I think in general, right? That's that's
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.280]  not the case. But yeah, so is are there other things that
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.160]  can't put a value that Apple can't put a value on, you know,
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.600]  financial dollar amount, I would say that it is impossible to put
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.360]  a dollar amount on the regulatory headwinds they're
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.440]  currently facing Tim. Tim Cook is currently scheduled to
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.280]  testify next week before Congress. I it was originally
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.520]  scheduled for Monday. And that's not going to happen Monday
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.160]  because of the ceremonies involving john lewis, who died
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.320]  last week. He'll be resting in state. So I think I don't know
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.040]  if they officially announced this postponed, but I think all
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.960]  that that testimony is, I don't know if it's postponed days a
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.320]  week or whatever, but it's coming, it is definitely going
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.520]  to happen. And and all of this, I mean, that that testimony
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.840]  isn't going to be the end of it.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.040]  No, well, and it's not just the US, right? Like, I think, to me,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.280]  I would be much more concerned about the European Commission,
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.520]  right? Because of their history with with what they do with
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.440]  that. But yeah, sorry, go on,
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.640]  I just don't think that even if you might be able, you probably
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.160]  could take some of those policies that I listed. And, you
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  know, let's just say the easiest one to me, would be the let's
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.640]  just change 7030 to 8515 across the board, right? And there,
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.240]  they're the repercussions and what would happen afterwards are
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.880]  the easiest to measure. Because you're not talking I mean, and
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.360]  to me, like the most radical would be like, what if we just
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.840]  said, we'll have third party app stores, and Google can have an
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.640]  App Store and Facebook can have an iPhone App Store, and Epic
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.560]  can have one where they sell games. Like, obviously, that
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.880]  would change the platform in far more significant ways, and
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.160]  financial ways for Apple. Let's just talk 8515 right there, you
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.600]  really could mostly measure this in money, it would be more money
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.480]  to developers without raising without changing the prices of
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.120]  their products in this App Store. Yep. You know, because 15
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.200]  and 30 are different numbers, and it would be less money for
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.600]  Apple. I thinking, you know, off the top right away. But maybe if
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.400]  it got more developers to get into the store and do it this
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.960]  way, like, what if I don't think they would in particular, but
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.200]  let's just say that if Apple said it's 88515, maybe the base
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.920]  camp, people would say, hey, that's good enough for us, we
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.720]  will put in the App Store and more apps would do it. So you
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.520]  can't quite say that doing that would reduce Apple's money,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.280]  right? And it you know, without devolving, it's hard to say.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.640]  And because I think I think the big thing there would be, would
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.600]  you be able to retain the services that are the number one
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.600]  apps are the number one services? Like would you know,
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.480]  the Spotify is and the Netflix is, would they not remove the
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.000]  the in app purchase module? That that I think is the question,
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.840]  would a 15% you know, split be worth it to them. And in some
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.280]  cases, it might be it depends on the margin of the business,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.120]  because you can make the argument and I think it's a very
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.480]  good argument to say, okay, by being in the App Store and
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.960]  having this mechanism, you this is essentially a way to onboard
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.480]  new users who you might not otherwise be able to get. I
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.320]  think that what Netflix in particular is so opposed to, and
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.200]  they're not wrong, is that at this point, I don't know if
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.520]  anyone is going to learn about Netflix for the first time by
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.920]  going to the App Store. So Netflix, understandably, in my
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.960]  opinion, is like the App Store is doing nothing to bring me a
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.480]  net new customer, they already know about the service, they are
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.120]  already going to be using this on other devices to especially
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.720]  if they're using any sort of TV device, which is where a
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.240]  tremendous amount of Netflix content is consumed. Apple TV
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.760]  has gone from being a large share of what the premium
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.720]  services, the percentage of things watch to a very small
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.440]  share. And so I think from Netflix's perspective, they're
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.960]  like, we're not getting new customers from this. But for
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.240]  smaller video services, streaming services, and for
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.600]  other subscription services that have to maybe adjust their rates
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.720]  because of the App Store percentage, if it were cut down,
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.520]  there's a possibility that they might not take the hay approach
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.680]  and be like, we're not going to leave, we'll stay because that
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.800]  15%, even though that can be a lot, compensates for what we're
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.720]  getting both in terms of billing and some of the support things
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.800]  and currency, you know, negotiations and whatnot, as
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:25.760]  well as bringing us net new users who we wouldn't be able to
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.640]  grab directly from our website or whatever sort of paid media
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.960]  we would have to do. Right.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.760]  So that's why I would say more than 85 15, even though it's
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.440]  gotten the most attention, and I'll get I'll get back to this
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.840]  attention on that 70 30 split. To me, if I if you said to me,
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.760]  john, we really, you know, we hear you on this App Store
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.160]  stuff. We've you've got five minutes with Tim Cook, to change
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.640]  to bend his to bend his ear on this and maybe change his mind.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.520]  I would focus entirely on the idea of extending what I call
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.280]  the Netflix rule to all developers. Yes. And, and I
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.960]  would just say on my web, when my five minutes is over, and
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.520]  they're escorting me out the door, and he's thanking me. And
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.680]  of course, you know, poker face that Tim Cook has giving
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.040]  nothing, right? Like, that it to me is the difference between
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.320]  like Steve Jobs and and Tim Cook is that you could read Steve
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.000]  Jobs like a book, right? Like doesn't matter what he's saying.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.680]  If he if he thinks you're a bozo, you're a bozo. Whereas Tim
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.520]  Cook, you get nothing. Thank you, john. And and as I'm
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.400]  leaving, I would just say and by the way, maybe think about 8515
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.120]  instead of 7030. Right, but I would spend the whole time
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.160]  trying to pitch him on just open the Netflix rule to everybody
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.640]  because as it's instituted right now, with this quote unquote,
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.040]  they call them reader apps, which is ridiculous. But it
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.720]  speaks to the fact Apple again, it gets naming things is hard.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.000]  And Apple is actually really good at naming things. In
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.280]  general, maybe not their products.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.480]  Hey, look, I work at I work at a place where naming is not what
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.920]  we're good at. So I think they're pretty good with naming
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.320]  honestly, yeah. But yeah, you know, they're pretty good at
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.200]  naming things. And when it comes to things like that, they're
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.720]  usually pretty good and calling Netflix, a reader app, or
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.480]  Spotify, a reader app, which is fantastic. It's a fantastic one,
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.320]  two combo. Because one of them you pretty much just listen to
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.120]  and the other one, you pretty much are watching shows.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.520]  Yeah. You know, my theory on that is, my theory on that is
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.640]  that it all started with with the with the Kindle. So that was
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.040]  the first time that they started to enforce these rules. And this
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.360]  was in 2011. And Sony was hit first because Sony had an e
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.040]  reader store that was only available in their app, you
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.720]  couldn't actually go to their website. And so Sony was hit
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.080]  first and Sony was banned. And I actually remember because I had
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.680]  I had a conversation with Apple PR and they explained that to me
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.920]  that because that the store exists only inside the
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.360]  application. That's why Sony would need to pay 30% for all
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.080]  their ebook purchases. And what Sony wound up doing because they
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.320]  didn't have the infra to create and set up like a full web
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.920]  store, as they just ended the store. And that I think was one
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.280]  of the things that led to them exiting that part of the e
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.040]  reader business. So for a while for another few weeks, Kindle
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.960]  was fine, because you know, the original Kindle app on an iPad
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.960]  and iPhone you could buy within like a web view on in the
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:34.120]  application, then that switched. And Kindle had to comply or get
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.880]  out. And even at first, I think very briefly, they were allowed
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.320]  to have a link to the store. And then that was very quickly
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.960]  turned down. And so the the way around that I think was that,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.640]  you know, Amazon created like an HTML five, like a version of
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.260]  the Kindle store that was kind of optimized for iPad, and they
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.020]  would have instructions where they'd show you how you could
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.260]  put it on your home screen and kind of have to teach people how
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.100]  to do that process. It was it was difficult for them to be
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.640]  explicit about it, but they were as explicit as they could be.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.780]  And so my view is that the reason I call them reader apps
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.720]  is because it started without it extended to Netflix and
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.700]  Spotify. And that became the much bigger thing. But I think
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.540]  because it started with the Kindle, because that was the
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.140]  first one that was the first time that they ever started
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.740]  enforcing that kind of 30% on these digital goods purchase
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.500]  from other, you know, third parties that, okay, Apple gets
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:34.380]  a cut to even even though, you know, presumably, I don't even
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.580]  know how you would bring something like the Kindle store
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.620]  to the iPhone, right? Like, you'd have to upload every
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.700]  single item for an in app purchase, like, there'd be no
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.140]  way to even do that. But they were just saying, Okay, if you
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.580]  want that, then we need to get a cut. And I that's my theory is
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.540]  why they call it reader apps, even though it's completely not
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.060]  accurate for what apps actually use that loophole now.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.540]  And you know, and they've made other exceptions. There are
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:02.620]  email apps that are in there using the same sort of thing and
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:02.980]  a couple
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.340]  there are although although I've heard from people because
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.300]  there have been a number of apps that have gone through this.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.940]  And I've heard from some very, very large app developers that
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.260]  this has been like a over the last few months, an issue of
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.700]  negotiation. And that it's been one of those things where even
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.620]  some of their updates have been delayed until they can kind of
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.580]  work out how they remove fast mail or just fast mail went on
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.100]  the record because fast, a great, great email provider fast
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.780]  mail. Yeah, I think they own the PO box now, like pobox.com,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.300]  which has been a long standing independent email provider,
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.820]  maybe not. I don't know, maybe I might be confused. But I know
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.460]  fast mail does fast mail has a great service. It's pure IMAP.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.740]  So you can use it with Apple mail or Microsoft Outlook or
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.460]  Gmail or whatever, anything that speaks IMAP, which is the
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:55.380]  lingua franca of email. And one of the problems with IMAP is
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.980]  that there are all sorts of different IMAP implementations.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.460]  Trust me, I know this, it's a long story. But IMAP is not just
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.420]  IMAP that all over the map in terms of how it's standards
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.780]  compliant, but fast mails is actually very great. They even
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.500]  have great push email service. So like you don't have to do
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.220]  anything, you just put in your credentials, and Apple mail will
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.140]  give you push email so you don't have to check frequently. It's
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.660]  great for your phone. But they also have a fast mail app that I
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.260]  don't know what else it does and why you might use it but because
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.780]  I don't use fast mail personally, but they do. And
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.260]  people pointed to it because you download the fast mail app and
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.660]  it just says what's your email and password and there's no way
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.820]  to sign up. And fast mail publicly said on Twitter because
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.180]  people it you know, we're saying hey, fast mail, you know, did
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.300]  you see this thing with Hey, and they're like, yes, Apple and
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.900]  very politely, you know, delicately in the way that
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.620]  companies talk to each other, especially when there's a power
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.100]  imbalance. Yes, we're like, yes, Apple has been in contact with
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.540]  us. And it's actually on our list for a future update to
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.380]  adopt in app purchasing going forward. Yeah. So, okay, but I
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.460]  would just say, just just do it. Just give everybody the Netflix
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:03.820]  option. Agreed. And, and make a very clear distinction that if
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:08.140]  you do commerce, for digital content, again, something like
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.700]  the way that you can buy real world stuff like you can go you
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.300]  can open the Amazon app and buy a six pack of soda and have it
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.860]  delivered to your house and it's not an in app purchase that
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.020]  Apple gets they draw the distinction for digital content.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.300]  If it's an in app purchase for digital content, it and you do
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.180]  it in the app, you have to use Apple's in app purchasing things
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.700]  and pay Apple their cut whatever their cut is and that changes
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.420]  that cut is a separate discussion. And if you don't
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.340]  want to use it, you have to do it outside the app. And so no
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:45.180]  web view in the app, you have to go to a website and do it there.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.340]  And if you want to do it that way, you do it that way. And
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.180]  then say we think in app purchasing is so much more
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:57.380]  convenient, so much more secure, and not secure in this spooky
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.100]  sense that like 20 years ago, people like no way am I putting
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.340]  my credit card on the internet, right? It's more like, and it's
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.620]  sort of coincidence that I mentioned it. But like the way
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.940]  that if you sign up for a New York Times subscription, I was
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.140]  just thinking this right exactly. So I you sign up for a
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.980]  New York Times subscription at New York times.com and you want
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:18.060]  to unsubscribe and you have to call them on the telephone and
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.580]  spend 45 minutes with them talking you out of it before
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.220]  they let you do it. It's like canceling AOL. It's Yeah, if you
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:28.900]  sign up for the New York Times in their app through an in app
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.340]  purchase, and you would like to unsubscribe, you go to settings,
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:36.380]  iCloud subscriptions, and then just cancel your subscription.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.460]  And at the end of the month, you're unsubscribed, and they'll
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.060]  never get your dollar again, you know. So like it is a tremendous
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.860]  advantage to users that you can feel you can know if you bought
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:51.660]  it through the app, you know, it went through your iTunes account
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:55.540]  and you know that you are not going to get billed more than
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.460]  you agreed to. And you know that if you would like to cancel a
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.980]  subscription, it is easy and obvious how to do it. And you do
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.780]  it. It's easy, obvious, and it's exactly like canceling any other
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.460]  subscription.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.420]  Yeah, no, I'm in full agreement, I would be I would probably make
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.260]  the same plea because to me, that is more important than I
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.900]  mean, I think that cut it to 15. I think that that is they could
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.860]  do one, they could do the other, they could do both. But to me,
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.420]  if they only do one, I would just say extend that Netflix
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.420]  rule to everybody. Yeah, no, I would agree with that. I would
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.340]  agree with that. I mean, I think that there are and I think
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.300]  the reason I like that is that part of the thing that concerns
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.140]  me with this move to services that I think has been kind of
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.460]  lost in some of the discussion around these broader things has
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.340]  been that what's happened is that the system has become
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:48.540]  gamified around, frankly, really shady and really gross practices
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.900]  by like really scummy app developers who do really gross
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.260]  things to push people into paying several several hundred
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.820]  dollars a year for a basic utility app because of the way
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.700]  that they show, you know, the the subscription is like, oh,
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.380]  it's going to be you know, 999 a week, not realizing, okay, I'm
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:11.620]  now paying $520 for this calculator. And those are the
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.060]  things that I are becoming incentivized right now as a way
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:18.300]  for people to make money. And those apps, the more people
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.460]  point them out, aren't being taken down, like I can buy the
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.700]  argument about why you need to have these rules to keep up the
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.900]  quality of the App Store, if the quality of the App Store is
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.740]  actually in a good place, I would argue that it's not. And
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.100]  so to me, it's it's a it's a bad faith argument to say, Oh, well,
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.460]  we have to have the reason we can't allow customers to sign up
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.020]  for a service outside the app, like they can with Netflix is
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.740]  because it's a bad user experience. That's really
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:49.140]  disingenuous, because there are so many applications that have
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:53.340]  really terrible experiences that are much, much worse than having
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.100]  to maybe go to a website or be confused and decide to delete
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.780]  the app. Like to me, that is is the wrong argument. And so I'm
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.620]  with you, if you could only pick one, I think extend the Netflix
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:12.300]  rule to everyone. And honestly, I think that the vast majority of
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:16.180]  services and developers who don't have, you know, a massive
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.660]  built in user base or have a massive ability to bring people
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.900]  in and pay for on their own platforms, would still find it
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:29.140]  very reasonable to at least have the option to have people sign
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:32.180]  up, you know, maybe not be the only way people can sign up, but
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.140]  but at least have the option. Like, I do think that you would
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:39.660]  see the drop off on some of your biggest services, but they
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.500]  already have different rules anyway, like,
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.340]  but even if you could put a dollar amount on it, and you and
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.860]  I'm sure internally, somebody, you know, Tim Cook would
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:50.260]  commissioned somebody inside the company to put a dollar on it.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.820]  You can't put a dollar amount on the regulatory weight that
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.180]  would be lifted off Apple's shoulders if they did that, and
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.580]  just said, Hey, you know, I keep saying, Hey, I think I say hey,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.180]  all the time. Like, and a whole bunch of people told me that
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.220]  when I did my live episode from WWDC, that I should start the
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:12.380]  show by telling people, you know, say the word hey. And it's
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.180]  like, I would probably do that anyway. I think every time I
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:20.060]  start talking, I say, hey, it's just sort of a good word, not
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.900]  really a joke. It's actually just how I started talking. But
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.820]  it's just so it confounds me though, because I keep talking
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:34.340]  about hey.com, the email, but they've even said that that's
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.260]  that's their big thing. They don't really, you know, it'd be
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.500]  nice if their 7030 was split, but they just want to be able to
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.220]  sign people up and they trust themselves to do it. And even
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:48.060]  exactly, even with the Apple has never said this out loud, but it
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:52.740]  is obvious and you see what they promote in the App Store, that
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:58.060]  they don't promote apps that don't like to my knowledge,
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:02.300]  they've never had an App Store story profiling Netflix, you
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.220]  know, no, but they do have things about what you can watch
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:10.340]  on Netflix, and shows you can stream and and that's because
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.460]  you talked about power dynamic earlier and that were power
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.300]  been balanced rather earlier. This is what's so interesting to
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.460]  me about this is that at a certain point, you know, Netflix
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.100]  and Spotify and some of the other places, you know, Amazon
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:26.300]  Video, whatnot, Apple clearly was in the power position. At a
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.420]  certain point, and think this is why Netflix gets special rules
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.380]  and can get special rules is that that power imbalance has
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.740]  shifted. I think it's slight, I think that they're probably near
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:39.660]  equal. But at this point, I pause it and I feel pretty
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.980]  strongly about this. I've said this on Twitter, and I feel very
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.180]  strong about this, that Netflix now has more power than Apple
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.260]  does in that relationship, because Apple needs Netflix on
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:49.740]  their devices.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.300]  You can't you can't sell iPhones and iPads and say there is
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.100]  absolutely no Netflix.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.060]  Exactly. Even more to the point, you know, like Apple TV, like,
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.700]  it's famously not part of the the TVs, you know, app and it
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.660]  won't be. And yet they still have to show these are things
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.340]  you can watch and integrate with it and they have serious
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.420]  support like they Yeah, at this point, Netflix has the dominant
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.660]  position there. And so they can do that most companies aren't
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.340]  going to have that and but for those that do or those that want
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.740]  to take the base camper out and say we can do this ourselves. I
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.820]  don't see the harm because again, I mean, my my thought is
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:31.500]  that I other than maybe some of the biggest players who already
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:36.300]  have special agreements like the bizarre Amazon agreement, where
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.500]  you can actually do in app purchase through your Amazon
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.820]  account for Amazon video, which is that's, you know, completely
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:47.740]  bizarre. At this point, it's one of those things where I don't
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.900]  think that you would see developers just fleeing the app
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.180]  store entirely. Some of them might but I don't I but it would
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:00.540]  do to your point would be really reduced the the, you know, kind
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:05.420]  of the the trade winds coming from from regulation. And to me,
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.140]  like, you want to be real careful with the regulatory
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:12.420]  climate, because what the regulators could introduce would
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.300]  be things that I think would be both bad for Apple and frankly,
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.460]  bad for users, like alternative app stores. I think alternative
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:21.420]  app stores is bad for users. I think that alternative payment
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:25.660]  platforms is actually bad for users. And if you don't want
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.940]  that, right, and that's the thing is you have to you and I
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.220]  know that there are I'm interrupting you only because I
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.020]  know that there are people listening who have the good the
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:36.980]  points of alternative payment that would be good and they want
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:40.060]  to raise their hand. But I think it full listing of all the
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.380]  things that could happen that are bad and the reduction in
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.780]  trust of knowing that if you're in the app, you can you're doing
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:49.500]  it the Apple way through your iTunes account is an overall
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500]  negative. Sorry.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.780]  Yeah, I agree. No, no, no, no, you're you're right. It is
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.260]  trade offs. And look, I do understand why people would make
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.500]  those arguments. I don't disagree. I guess like top
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.820]  level, but I think when you when it comes down to it, the
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.420]  bottom line is that when people use we've been trained for 13
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.820]  years, 12 years, I guess, since there have been apps, that if
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:12.940]  you buy something, it's going through Apple. And if you
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.740]  switch that, so you feel secure, if you switch that to it could
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.380]  be going someplace else, and you don't have that trust your
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.100]  relationship, that's really negative. And that could be
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.500]  really devastating if the payment provider isn't scrupulous
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.380]  or if something happens and someone's hacked, you know, and
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.740]  or you know that whoever the app service was using, you know,
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.460]  if the the payment processor was hacked, or if there was
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.940]  credentials leaked or whatever, or just just, how about just
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.660]  making a subscription hard to cancel? Yes, agreed. Totally,
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.060]  even if it's just makes it more difficult to cancel your New
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:50.060]  York Times subscription, that is a negative. And so, you know,
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.180]  to me, obviously be very bad for Apple, but it would be bad for
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.940]  users. And so yeah, I'm with you, because I feel like if you
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.700]  don't get ahead of this and make some concessions, you risk
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:05.900]  having concessions forced on you, that could be so much worse
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.940]  for everyone. And they're unpredictable, right? Regulators
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.580]  don't really get it. They don't. I mean, they've seen it over the
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:15.100]  years, and they don't get it and they have bad idea. I mean,
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.140]  honestly, look at and add to me, what makes it all the more
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:21.500]  confounding that Apple doesn't seem more concerned about this
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:29.660]  is how badly the iBooks, ebooks thing turned out, which I guess
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:34.620]  is eight, seven, eight years ago, Apple got robbed on that,
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:38.780]  in my opinion, I really think it's, it's insane, because the
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.220]  regulators only looked at it in terms of does it make prices to
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:46.620]  consumers go up? Yes, therefore you're in the wrong. And you've
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:52.060]  abused, you know, anti competitive antitrust. Meanwhile,
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.780]  Amazon's the one with the literal monopoly on ebook sales,
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.140]  like everybody knows, like, whatever your ballpark back your
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:04.060]  whatever your guesses on how Kindle sales compared to iBook
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:07.660]  sales, seven or eight years ago, you're probably underestimating
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.540]  how much stronger Kindle was. And there were competitors like
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.380]  Barnes and Noble with the Nook, who for Apple iBooks was like a
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.260]  lark, like, yeah, that's another thing we can get into Barnes and
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:21.980]  Noble. It's an existential threat. And especially even
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.860]  then, like, I kind of feel like I don't know how well Barnes and
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.940]  Noble is doing. And I know that the Coronavirus thing is
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:31.020]  probably terrible. But I kind of feel like it, not to go on too
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.300]  much of an aside, I kind of feel like paper books are holding
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.740]  their own in a lot of ways. But seven or eight years ago, that
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.500]  was very unclear. No, it was it was very Yeah, there was I used
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.140]  to write a ton about this. And I used to talk with publishers
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.420]  and with device makers about this. And there was this massive
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.980]  massive fear in publishing that it was going to go the way of
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:54.300]  the music industry, right? Or that it was going to what did
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.140]  happen. It's interesting books have persisted. And actually, if
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.500]  anything, they've started to outsell in some categories. And
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.380]  it's very interesting that you see a lot of physical books
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.100]  sold. It's it's kind of like vinyl, but at much bigger
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.940]  volumes, whereas magazines were completely decimated, right?
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.260]  Like, like, like print magazines, print newspapers have
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.780]  been completely decimated, but print books have not been. But
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:19.900]  that wasn't the thought. The thought was, and that was why
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.620]  Barnes and Noble and Borders before they went bankrupt, they
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:27.100]  had to deal with with with Kobo who now Rakuten owns, you know,
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.380]  like, they were having to kind of get into the space. They were
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.180]  fighting for their life, literally thought that we need
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.900]  to do this, or we might just go out. Yeah, exactly. And they
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.460]  disrupt nothing on Kindle. And yet Kindle was the not the one
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:43.980]  Kindle and Amazon wasn't the one that regulators looked up.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.220]  Not only that, but when the settlement came out, you got
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:52.780]  Kindle credit. Do you remember? Like I ended up getting because
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.900]  I buy a ton of ebooks, I ended up getting a ton of money back
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:01.180]  from Amazon, I got like $47 or something. And I was like, is
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.740]  which that to me was the was the insane thing. I was like, you
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.220]  know, if you were somebody who didn't know anything about it,
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.780]  and hadn't read any of the briefs, and you just heard, you
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:12.300]  know, ebook price fixing scandal, your first thought it I
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.260]  think would be Oh, Amazon was involved in something and they
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:19.500]  were, you know, like, slapped down. No, it was it was Apple.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.700]  And ironically, the deal that Apple was trying to make then
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.260]  was to be more fair to the publishers, which is the
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:29.260]  complete opposite of the you know, the 70 30 split now with
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.620]  developers, they were actually trying to make things more fair
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.220]  and more even for publishers and say you can't undercut things
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.860]  and take a different margin, you have to set the same price
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:43.340]  everywhere. That was actually you know, a very pro publisher
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:48.460]  pro book business move. And the you know, what was the FTC or
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.980]  whoever, or FCC I'm not sure which who DOJ, whatever,
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.180]  whatever, government, the DOJ, because the DOJ read that no,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:00.700]  you are price fixing and are artificially pushing prices up.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:06.060]  And what's happened, ironically, is that now, Amazon is in this
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.140]  place where you know, because they used to undercut the
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.700]  ebooks all the time, like that was a very common tactic. And
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.180]  that was how they sold, they sold them at a loss where the
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.660]  publisher would say, here's, here's a new Stephen King novel,
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.020]  right? Or, you know, here's the new book from insert big, big
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.300]  name author, who's going to sell a ton of books. It's brand
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.580]  new, you know, it's 999. No, but the publisher would say it's
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.620]  1799. Oh, exactly. That's what I mean. But Amazon would sell it
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:34.140]  for 999. And what's happened, though, is that now you do still
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.940]  have some of that. But most of the big houses and also
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:40.060]  publishing has, even though they've made like, print books
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:43.820]  have have survived publishing itself is like, most forms of
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:47.420]  written media is a shit show. They've all consolidated even
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:50.060]  more. And most of those publishers have arrangements
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.620]  like Hatchin and Simon and Schuster and others, where they
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:56.700]  set the price and Amazon can't undercut them. So ironically,
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:02.140]  the whole thing that the DOJ is like, you know, like rule has
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:07.900]  come to pass anyway, Amazon and, you know, Rakuten and who owns
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:14.380]  by, you know, Kobo and iBooks don't have the ability to
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:17.100]  adjust prices for a lot of the best sellers. Right. But
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:22.620]  Kindle's Amazon strategy with Kindle was a loss leader, not
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:25.500]  gonna say nefarious, but it was it was a loss leader. And their
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.460]  idea was, we'll sell them all for 999, because that's a great
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:32.460]  price. And even if it's a loss, we'll eat it, we'll dominate
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.260]  the market. And then when, you know, then we'll be the only
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.540]  one selling, you know, we we would like to build a monopoly
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.860]  on ebooks, and then we can change prices later,
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.100]  then we can change prices. And not only that, they then
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:47.100]  started to become publisher, they don't even hide that fact.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.340]  But the whole problem is that the and again, I don't want to
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.820]  get too sidelined on this. But the whole problem is that all
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:54.940]  of these antitrust laws in the US and in Europe around the
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.420]  world, we're all based on the idea that the abuse of a
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.660]  monopoly would be to artificially increase prices,
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.420]  right, which makes intuitive sense and also makes historical
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.940]  sense, right, that once, like Rockefeller, or whoever it was,
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:14.220]  who owned the whole railroad from coast to coast, and could
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:19.260]  control all of the steel, going from steel foundries in
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.660]  Pittsburgh to the West Coast, where they were building San
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.700]  Francisco, and you know, the, you know, the modern West
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:28.700]  Coast world, that the person selling the steel also owned
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.420]  the railroad, and it was the only way to get it there and
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.900]  could set the price for his competitors to whatever he
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.420]  wanted to, while his own steel wasn't being charged at all,
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.100]  etc. It's all about raising prices artificially. And yeah,
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.580]  we need government regulation to keep it down. None of the
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:47.340]  laws anticipated, well, what if there's a publicly held
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:51.820]  company that the shareholders buy into the argument that all
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.860]  we're looking for is ever increasing revenue and no
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:58.220]  profits at all, just break even, don't need that exactly,
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.500]  just build market share and dominate and then, you know,
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.460]  good things will happen in the future. Yeah, what if you could
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:07.580]  be Walmart, but you didn't have to turn a profit? Right. And,
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.020]  you know, none of the regular, none of the laws were built
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.980]  with that in mind. And then the thing with the ebooks case with
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:18.220]  Apple was that the regulators themselves don't have it in
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.340]  mind. It was all, it never went further than, well, wait,
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:27.660]  Amazon wants to sell these books for $9.99. If, you know,
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.060]  Apple's deal with the publishers meant that the books
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:32.380]  would cost whatever the publishers say, which was often
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.420]  more than $9.99. Therefore, that's price fixing and higher
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.300]  prices of consumers you lose. And that was it. And you're out.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.260]  And it was like that casino hearing in the movie
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:45.900]  Casino where they never even gave Robert De Niro's character
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.020]  a chance. They're like, nope, your license is out. And that's
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.460]  it. Case closed. It's over. So why in the world would Apple
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.260]  trust the regulatory process on this to come to a sensible
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:58.940]  conclusion? Like if you're thinking, well, I don't blame
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.820]  Apple for taking their chances on this because if the worst
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:06.060]  case, if they lose, the regulators will just impose
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.660]  very fair rules on Apple and Apple can certainly live with
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.500]  those. You don't know that that's what they're going to
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.420]  impose at all. It is an incredible gamble, right? So in
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.380]  addition to not being able to put a price on it, there's also
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:21.660]  the idea of like, how do you know, how do you value risk
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:25.740]  avoidance? You know, it's the risk avoidance of this is like,
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.100]  what happens if there's a major earthquake? What happens if
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.620]  let's just say, theoretically, Christina, what if there's a
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:39.500]  pandemic? Who knows, right? You can't value that, right? You
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.740]  don't know how. Nobody knew or knows going forward what the
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:48.700]  cost of this pandemic is going to cost. You have no idea what
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:55.260]  regulatory rules imposed upon the app store could do. So why
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.580]  not do what you can to sidestep it now and just tell the
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:03.180]  shareholders, look, it's just, you know, I don't know,
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:05.820]  services are still growing. They will grow. We have great
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.940]  faith in it, but we're more proud of selling our own
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:14.140]  services. We are so sure about Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:18.700]  and Apple News and the longest standing of our ongoing
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.740]  subscription services iCloud, which we still think, you know,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.980]  we have 98% of whatever they want to say the number is of
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.260]  people who are into it and just say we want to sell our own
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.300]  services and we're so confident that our app store is such a
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.340]  great deal for third party developers that we'll let you
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.140]  sidestep it if you want because we think you'll make more by
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:41.900]  being in the store and doing it in app. There you go. That's
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.340]  what I would, I would sell Tim Cook on. The other thing I would
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:49.660]  like to see them do is in addition to that, at least let
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:54.220]  develop, let everybody do the Netflix thing and expand the
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:33:00.300]  Netflix rule to at least let apps tell you what to do. Yeah.
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.980]  Let, when you download Netflix and you say, I've, I've, you
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:06.380]  know, I've heard about this Netflix thing. I can't believe
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:10.220]  it's 2020. I don't have it yet, but I want to get it, right? I
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.260]  don't know who you are that you don't have Netflix yet, but if
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:18.220]  they must be out there. But you have an iPhone. Right. You know,
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.780]  and maybe it is an older audience, you know, you know,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:23.260]  maybe my mom, I don't think my mom has Netflix. She does have
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.820]  an iPhone, so maybe she decides she's going to sign up for
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:29.980]  Netflix. At least tell her what to do. I mean, it should just
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:35.820]  say call John. Yeah, that's true. Contact your son. He'll
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.260]  walk you through it. Part of the Netflix rule as it stands,
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.700]  even with all the problems with the weird exceptions and who
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.420]  counts as a reader app, even though some of them clearly
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.300]  aren't readers at all, part of it is that they're, they keep
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.900]  talking like, and, and again, it's very strange for Apple. It
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:56.380]  would be very strange for Apple not to, to, to acknowledge that
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:59.740]  yes, this part of our business is not friendly to our
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:04.060]  customers at all. It is counter, counter, you know, it is,
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.100]  what's the opposite of friendly? It is in, it's a bad
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.020]  experience for customers. It would, it's hard to imagine
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:14.780]  Apple saying that, but yet the idea that you're allowed to,
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:20.300]  you know, download Netflix, you, Netflix is allowed not to have
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:24.140]  in-app purchases, but Netflix can't tell you that what to do
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:28.140]  is go to Netflix.com and sign up there. That, they're not
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.980]  allowed to say that, let alone making it a link that you can
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.740]  tap. I'm not even saying that, right? Because I kind of get,
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:38.380]  here's the thing with the tap. I kind of understand the, the
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.420]  lack of the click. I'm with you on that. Please tell people
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.540]  something. Sorry. Well, it's for people listening to this
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.860]  show, I'm sure that a majority of them are going to think I've
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.860]  lost, I'm off my rocker here and disagree, but I'm trying to
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:56.380]  put myself in the shoes of the type of user who is confused
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.900]  about what's a browser and what's an app, right? And if you
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.940]  just tap it and it jumps you over to Safari, but starting in
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:08.220]  the fall could be a different browser because iOS 14 is going
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:10.700]  to support third-party browsers, but it'll go to your
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:14.860]  default browser. Let's assume that it's Safari because anybody
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.220]  who will know starting in the fall, how to change their
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:21.500]  default browser or what a default browser is, isn't as
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.620]  confused about what's in a browser and what's in an app. So
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.460]  you jump over to Safari, but you know, how do you know? I
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:31.580]  mean, do, does everybody know that you've left the app and
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.860]  now you're in Safari? Whereas if the instructions don't even
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.260]  let you tap it, although I wouldn't be opposed if they
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.660]  said you can even make it a link. I wouldn't be opposed.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.380]  No, I wouldn't be opposed either, but I can see why they
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.820]  don't, but just let them say, go to Netflix, hit the big sign
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:49.100]  up button in the top right corner and sign up there. Then
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.140]  come back and sign into this app using the email and
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.340]  password you created at our website. One, two, three,
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.500]  four. See you when you sign back, come back to the app. Let
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.060]  them do that. Let them say, go to hey.com and sign up there,
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.340]  then come back and sign into this app. Just say, just let
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.380]  them say it because the way it is now where you can't even
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:14.940]  say that is insane in terms of how confusing it is, right?
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:19.980]  And it's, you know, it, it, it's, how can you possibly argue
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:23.100]  that that benefits anyone other than Apple?
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.140]  Exactly, exactly. And I think, I mean, like, right, and it
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:29.260]  doesn't. I think when you put those, like, such strict rules,
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.220]  like, I'm actually more open to the idea of not having a
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.940]  link, not just for the reasons you mentioned, but I'll be
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:38.540]  honest, I think that that is maybe Apple giving up too much
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.620]  of its business to someone else. I don't think they
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.020]  necessarily need to have a link there. I don't think that
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.820]  that is necessarily something a company needs to do to
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:49.260]  basically say, we are going to give a direct, like, vector
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:53.260]  for someone to, like, purposefully avoid our, our
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.220]  payment system. Like, I don't think they need to do that,
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.140]  like, from a business perspective. I don't think that
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.300]  that needs to happen, but you make a good point, too. It's
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.940]  also just a bad user experience when the user is in a
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:07.180]  situation where the, because it's not as if the developers
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.980]  don't want to tell them how to sign up. It's that they can't.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.900]  Right. And therefore, anybody who is vaguely confused about
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:18.940]  what happens when you tap, it says Netflix.com slash sign
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:22.780]  up, and you tap it, and then you lift your finger, and next
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:25.980]  thing you know, you're at a sign up form, right? Are you
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:29.420]  still in the app? Have you jumped to your web browser? I'm
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.580]  not going to be confused by that. You're not going to be
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:34.620]  confused by that. I would venture to say just about every
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.340]  single one of the thousands of people listening to me and you
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:40.380]  talk about this are not going to be confused by that. But out
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.500]  of our parents might be, there's all sorts of people who
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:47.500]  might be. Just make it instructions. Make it clear. I
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:50.060]  think, you know, if you're getting to the point where if
[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.220]  you're just following the instructions and have to go to
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.180]  the website to sign up, and you still aren't sure you're in the
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.660]  app, well, then you're a lost cause. That's exactly that's a
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:00.300]  bigger problem. No, I think I think exactly and I think also
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.660]  like it would be good for Apple in some ways again, not to have
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.780]  the link because that could cause confusion but to have the
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.660]  instructions because Apple doesn't want people to think
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:12.140]  that they have a one to one relationship with these
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.500]  services if they don't, you know, so to your point, if you
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:19.340]  need to unsubscribe, like make it very clear. I didn't sign up
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.020]  in the app, you know, like because otherwise, even for
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.140]  people who might think that they're savvy, I could see that
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:29.340]  the confusion. Well, I remember signing up on my phone like I
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:31.740]  remember opening the app and signing up. So, of course, it's
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.140]  in my subscriptions because that's how it's worked. If
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.860]  that's going to change, yeah, you don't necessarily need to
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.340]  have the link but have the instructions. It could be very
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:44.700]  simple. This is what you do and go from there and I
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:49.100]  genuinely think that the number of people who would completely
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:53.820]  askew using the app store at all is relatively small. So,
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:58.140]  when they whereas having that option would buy both goodwill
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:02.780]  with developers, which I think is an important thing, but also
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.220]  the incalculable thing to your point is, okay, this could help
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:09.260]  get the get the feds off off our back.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.140]  And Apple does this all the time. And this argument that
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:17.020]  well, I see it come up all the time. And again, I'm not going
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:19.340]  to say that we've been collectively brainwashed. That's
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:22.140]  a strong word. And there are people who are apparently
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:26.780]  brainwashed at the moment on other issues. But there is this
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:30.540]  widespread belief that publicly held corporations are beholden
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.460]  to shareholders to quote unquote maximize profits at all
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:39.260]  costs. And I see people who are even amenable to this and who
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.580]  are like, yeah, I wish Apple could do this, but you know,
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.860]  they have to do what's best for shareholders. And so they, you
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.740]  know, they've got to do this, you know, they got to squeeze
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:50.780]  every penny they can out of the app store. That's not true at
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:55.100]  all. It is absolutely not true. I mean, there's the
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.700]  responsibility that the board has to shareholders and that the
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:02.380]  CEO has to the board is to do right by the shareholders and
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:06.380]  to run the company in a legal way in a responsible way. And,
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:11.100]  you know, but you're not, you're not, there's no legal
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.260]  obligation. It doesn't even make any sense. If you really
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:15.420]  think about it, it makes no sense.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:18.060]  No, the fiduciary responsibility is about making
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.940]  sure that you're not hiding money or doing things
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:24.060]  unethically with the, with your profits or with your salaries,
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.060]  that you're reporting things the right way. And that
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:29.340]  shareholders are aware of how money is being spent and how it
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:33.100]  comes in. It has nothing to do with, oh, because we're public,
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:37.020]  the shareholders are beholden to us squeezing every cent we
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:40.140]  can out of everything because companies make decisions all
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.700]  the time. If that were the case, then you could say, well,
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:47.100]  why does Apple spend so much on its components and on its
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.300]  machining and on, you know, the things that make their
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.180]  products higher quality, because obviously that reduces
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.740]  margins. They could be making so much more money if they use
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:58.140]  these cheaper components. That would, that would, that would
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.260]  benefit the shareholders. No one makes that argument. It's
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:05.820]  understood that, you know, you can make the choice to, to
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.900]  invest in what you want to invest in. And you could, that,
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:10.380]  that I think goes into your business models. You can choose
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:13.900]  to say, this is the right thing for our business, which
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:17.500]  ultimately is being responsible for the shareholders. If, you
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.660]  know, it's, this is the right thing for our business, not,
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:22.700]  this is how we can squeeze every penny and be Scrooge
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.340]  McDuck.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:27.020]  Right. It's, you know, and it's, it just is not there. It's,
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.740]  you know, and, and Tim Cook has even said this at some point,
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.460]  you know, where I, he, it was like a shareholders meeting
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:35.900]  years ago and the closest I've ever heard him just swear in,
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:39.420]  in, in public. It was like somebody was talking about like
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:43.020]  accessibility as a cost or something. And Tim Cook got
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.300]  angry and was like, I don't care about the bloody ROI, you
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.860]  know, and, and, you know, Tim Cook, I pretty sure is not
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:49.260]  British.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.340]  No, I don't think so. He's from, he's from Alabama.
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:56.540]  Yeah, but is Alabama in Great Britain? No, it turns out
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:59.980]  Alabama is in the US South. So no, he's not British. So
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:05.500]  bloody was not part of his natural vocabulary. But I, you
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:08.060]  know, you can imagine what other words he might've wanted
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.580]  to substitute there. Yeah. It's not always about the ROI.
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.460]  It's about the whole thing. And Apple, is Apple a well run
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:19.020]  company that is making profits, you know, and even if they do
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:22.460]  make a strategic change that significantly decreases the
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:25.500]  profits they draw from the App Store in and of itself from
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:28.860]  third party developers, that is totally in line with Apple's
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:32.300]  strategic value. And they can totally make a very strong case
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.860]  that it's actually in shareholders interest in the
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:38.460]  long run, that this is a better idea. It's, it's better to be
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.300]  competitive. We believe in competition. We think it's
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.780]  better for our developer partners. We want them to be
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.260]  happy. It's better for the ecosystem. It's better for us
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:51.500]  in a regulatory landscape. It's all good for us, even if it
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.180]  means less money in the short run from what we draw from
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:59.260]  third party applications. That's it. Same way that I think that
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.620]  Apple could, and probably should, and again, it's a side
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:05.580]  thing, but I think that they could and probably should get
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:10.540]  out of the casino business of participating and allowing the
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:17.740]  sort of pay to win games like Candy Crush that are built
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:21.580]  around the concept of whales who get hooked on the game and
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.260]  spend exorbitant amounts of money, in my opinion, hundreds
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.580]  of dollars, perhaps a month, and have Apple taking 30% of
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.940]  that money. You know, it's like my, I always say like, you know,
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.020]  there's a reason why the Disney cruise ships don't have
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.420]  casinos, you know, and it's not, you know, the reason all
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.900]  the other cruises have casinos is because there's no laws
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.340]  regulating having a casino and casinos are profitable and
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:49.660]  people like to gamble. I like to gamble. If I were on a Disney
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.380]  cruise and they had a casino, I would love it. I think Disney
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.860]  could make an amazing casino. I would like to see a Disney
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.180]  casino. I would actually, I was going to say, I don't usually
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.660]  like cruise ship casinos. Yeah, you'd go to the Disney one. I
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.620]  would love a Disney one. The Disney one would be great.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.100]  People would be paying money just to have the decks of
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.380]  cards. Oh, my God. I mean, people would would or to keep
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.900]  the chips, right? Oh, my God. They could make the chips
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.060]  collectible the same way that they do like the little, you
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.940]  know, Mickey Mouse's, right? Yeah. But Disney doesn't do it
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:22.700]  because they don't want to be involved with gambling. And
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:26.300]  again, I say this as someone who loves to gamble, you know, but I
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:29.260]  also totally see why Disney doesn't want their brand
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.380]  associated with it. I don't see how Apple's dalliance with the
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:38.860]  candy crushes of the world isn't effectively having an
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:42.700]  Apple casino in in Las Vegas, which I don't think they would
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:46.300]  do. Again, that would, they make a lot of money, I think,
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:50.060]  from the candy crush type games by drawing 30% of that money. A
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.940]  lot of it is coming from people who are, for lack of a better
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:00.860]  word, addicted in an unhealthy way to these games. And for
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:05.660]  Apple to be taking 30% of that is, in my opinion, morally
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:09.420]  wrong. And I think it's actually in Apple's not to, I'm
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:12.060]  not preaching to them that they should walk away from this
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.020]  money for no reason other than the ethics. I actually think,
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:18.220]  though, that there's brand value and not being associated
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:21.580]  with that, and that that brand value outweighs whatever the
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:24.300]  dollar value is of the money that they're getting from it.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:28.460]  Yeah, it's interesting that there's not a moral, you know, I
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:32.700]  guess, aversion to that model, whereas there is if you want to
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:35.660]  have adult content, or if, you know, other types of content,
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:38.060]  which there are rules about and that Apple has made a very clear
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:40.460]  stance, you know, Steve Jobs was very clear at the beginning,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.500]  like he didn't want Playboy in the App Store. He didn't want
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.220]  that stuff in the App Store. And that is a decision. There was
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:48.380]  nothing legally that would mandate that from not being
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:51.500]  allowed, like that would maybe complicate some things like
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.820]  depending on what content they sold on on their payment
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:56.620]  processor, but also Apple's big enough that I think that'd be
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:00.060]  fine. That was that was a judgment case. And so it's
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.260]  interesting, you know, just where you draw the line. And
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:08.140]  yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with what you're saying. I get
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:11.260]  I'm very cynical in the sense that I think that the amount of
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:14.540]  money they get from those types of games has to be so massive,
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:17.980]  that that would be a very difficult thing.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.940]  Yeah, but why not, though? But isn't that the Steve Jobs thing
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:23.420]  that maybe it's difficult? Isn't it difficult to just say,
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.900]  Okay, yeah, there's an antenna problem. Here it is.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:28.140]  No, no, you're, you're completely correct. Let's rip
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:31.820]  the bandaid off. The one thing that's harder, I think, is that
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:37.740]  in this case, you have a history of how much money you know that
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.220]  you're losing. So it's a much bigger risk.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.380]  What a tremendous benefit it is to be a part of a lucrative
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:48.620]  business like this and have it be a fraction of your income.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:52.140]  And without question, will always be a fraction of their
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:55.580]  income. Their services is never going to outweigh this device
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:47:00.380]  sales. It's it shouldn't and never will. It's it. They don't
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.380]  need it. So why not have the liberty of doing it? And why
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:11.100]  take? Here's the risk. What if what, you know, this is would be
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.020]  my message to Tim Cook, the, you know, in advance of this of
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:20.060]  this testimony, why not be the one to do it and say, Look,
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.220]  we're going to, you know, we're going to open this up and let
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:26.060]  it let you use the Netflix rule, and we're going to go 85 15.
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:29.420]  We're going to do it and let other people follow. Because
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:33.100]  what if Sundar Pichai gets up there and says, Hey, we're,
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.820]  we're just going to go 85 15, or we're going to go 90 10. And
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.500]  then all of a sudden, you look like the jerk, who's coming in
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:44.780]  after Sundar Pichai, and you're there, right? You've got all
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.620]  this, and you're there, like everything you've prepared,
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.140]  they're defending it. Everything you've prepared is, hey, we're
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.660]  70 30. But so is everybody else. And you're coming in after
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.540]  somebody who just, you know, took the carpet out from under
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:00.380]  your feet. Why Why not be the one to do it act first and look
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.100]  like the leader.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:06.060]  So an interesting model is one that exists in the Microsoft
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.620]  Store, which I was not aware about until recently, when a
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:12.140]  developer told me and apparently, there is still, I
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:14.380]  guess, like, whatever the standard split is, if you
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.420]  discover and buy the app directly, like on your own in
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:21.020]  the store, but if you get to the store from a link that the
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.740]  developer has put on their own website, or their own
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.260]  advertisements, or whatever, then there's no commission,
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:27.900]  there's no cut.
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:31.100]  Oh, that's interesting. That's a good rule. I like that, too.
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.660]  Yeah. And then it and I think that that's an interesting, like
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.300]  kind of way around some of that, right? It's like, okay, if
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.780]  you can bring the audience, then you get all the money, the
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.500]  payment and everything is still gonna be handled by us. And
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.140]  we're still going to be, you know, making the rules over
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.900]  other stuff. But if the audience comes to this through
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.580]  us, then then we get the commission.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:56.460]  Yeah. And you know, like, yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.780]  Certainly seems fair. And again, I know that the people
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:04.300]  who defend Apple in the App Store's current policy exactly
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:08.460]  as is the most, are almost to a T. I mean, there's always an
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.820]  exception, but they're not developers, they are users. And
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:14.460]  there's an intuitive sense that they're, you know, it's not
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.300]  like Apple's basic argument is outlandish. It, you know,
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.420]  there's an intuitive sense to it. And they buy it, which is
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.060]  that, hey, Apple is doing all this great work to make the
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:28.060]  App Store and new versions of the OS, new APIs every year.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:31.500]  And they promote apps within the App Store. And it's great
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:35.100]  distribution channel. So they, you know, deserve some amount
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.260]  of money. And if you want to argue about whether it should
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.060]  be 7030 or something else, sure, but they certainly deserve
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:44.300]  it. And anybody who's trying to cut around it is looking for a
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.500]  free ride, right? And Apple said this, and there's a lot of
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:50.780]  people who buy into it. And in some sense, it is true that
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:53.580]  they are looking not to pay anything like with the Netflix
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.380]  rule, but to call it a free ride is something else. And the
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:00.780]  promotional aspect, sure. Okay. Like, and Jason Fried and David
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:03.580]  Hennemeyer Henson have said it with, hey, like, okay, fine.
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.500]  If you guys don't want to promote us in the App Store
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:09.500]  ever, fine. We're very confident in our abilities to promote
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.380]  the app. We know how many people are signing up for it.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:15.100]  And we're on our wait list. We're fine with our own ability.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.740]  Just let us have the app in the store. So if somebody goes in
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:20.940]  and searches for, hey, email, there it is, they can download
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:24.300]  it. And there it is. You don't have to promote us at all. Just
[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:27.180]  let us be in the store. We'll handle everything else and
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:31.980]  handle all of our own promotion. That's fine. Did you see this
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.460]  thing before we move on? Apple had a commission to study this
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:41.420]  week from a group called the Ant Analysis Group, which again,
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:44.300]  I made this joke on dithering, but I haven't made it again. It
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:48.300]  sounds to me like Analysis Group as the name of your company
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:52.380]  reminds me so much of the company James Bond works for,
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:57.740]  which is Universal Exports. Right. No, totally. Well, it's
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.740]  interesting because like, and then reading through this
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.620]  report, like with this whole thing is like, this looks just
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:06.460]  like any McKinsey report ever. And it's so hard to imagine
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:09.420]  Steve Jobs sitting through this report. It's not. Oh, yeah.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:13.740]  It's not poorly written, but yeah, it's just seems like, oh
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:18.460]  my God, this is like generic corporate Fortune 500 America.
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.100]  Yeah. Like, no, this is like straight out of like, you know,
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:25.020]  McKinsey and some of the other big like, you know, consulting
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:27.900]  firm playbook. Like it's well formatted, it's well
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:31.500]  written, but it's totally that. I love what you said on
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.900]  during Fireball about how, like, if you have to compare
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.900]  yourself to Ticketmaster, like we're not as bad as Ticketmaster,
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.940]  then you're losing argument. Right. And I agree. I'm like,
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:45.980]  okay. And if you look at their table four in there, the thing
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.140]  is like on page nine, if anybody wants to look at this
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:51.100]  report, where they're showing the different percentage of
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:56.460]  these things, the only services that have more than what
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:52:01.020]  Apple's commission is are ticket resale and potentially
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:06.060]  food delivery. And even then, like it's close. So it's like,
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:09.020]  okay, we all know how lecherous, and there's been so much
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:13.100]  discussion right now about like the very, very predatory
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.740]  nature of these food delivery services and how they're
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:18.620]  effectively helping put restaurants out of business.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.260]  Right. So it's like, okay, you're going to compare
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:25.100]  yourself to Uber Eats or Ticketmaster. Who've been in the
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.620]  news for like scamming restaurants and being so foolish
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:33.020]  and fueled by VC money that they will let themselves get
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:36.380]  into an arbitrage situation where they've miss scraped the
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:40.620]  company's menu and are willing. And then forward to a different
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:44.540]  phone number that they control. Right. And are willing to pay
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:49.100]  $20 for a $9 pizza and stuff like that. Anyway, here, let me
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:53.740]  read CNBC's summary of the report. In my opinion is
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:58.300]  outstanding, cannot be beaten. And therefore, you tell me if
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:01.020]  you agree that this is an apt and complete summary of the
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:04.220]  entire report. The Apple back study has four major findings.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:10.860]  Most app stores charge the same 30% and digital goods point to
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:14.060]  retailers, travel booking services and other marketplaces
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:17.820]  can charge more than 30 for their services. Three
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:21.340]  distributing software through an app store is less expensive
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:24.620]  than distributing through brick and mortar retailers and then
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:28.060]  point for other app stores and digital marketplaces often
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:31.340]  require users to use their in app purchase mechanism and
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:34.300]  forbid sellers from redirecting buyers to finish the
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:41.420]  transaction in another venue. So 30%, everybody does it. Two,
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.620]  some companies outside of app stores charge even more than
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:49.740]  30. Three, brick and mortar was worse. Four, the other app
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.700]  stores make you use the app store too. That's 1234. That's
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:56.300]  the whole report. And so that's it saved you 50 pages. Apple's
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.940]  participation and commission of this report and their help
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:02.220]  promoting it into the news media suggests very strongly to
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:06.220]  me that this is a preview of Tim Cook's defense and testimony
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:10.460]  at before the regulatory people next week. We don't know, but it
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:14.380]  certainly would seem so because if Apple didn't, wasn't
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:18.220]  thinking of this as a blueprint for their defense, why would
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:20.780]  they release it, right? They commissioned it, but then if
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.780]  they didn't like it, they could just say, ah, we don't like
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:26.380]  this. You know, here's your money. We're going to bury the
[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:30.780]  report. Point three, everybody is pointing out. Nobody, even
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.740]  people who are generally like, yeah, I'm with Apple on this. I
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:37.020]  think Apple's in the right. Even those people are like brick and
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:41.020]  mortar. What? What the hell are you talking about? It's like
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:45.340]  all of a sudden, like if Apple was a car maker and they're
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:49.740]  going before Congress to testify about the move, the
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:52.860]  industry moving to electric vehicles, and they issue a
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.820]  report talking about what a pain in the ass it was back in
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.620]  the day when you had to use a crank to start your car.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:03.100]  Right, right. And what the hell are you talking about? No,
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:06.220]  exactly. I mean, to me, it also kind of ignores a bunch of
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.140]  other things. Like there was an argument that some people were
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:12.940]  making during the Hay fiasco last month about how, okay,
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:15.500]  well, you know, back in the day when you had to sell box
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:20.380]  software in stores, it was a much worse experience. And I
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:23.260]  don't doubt that. And I'm not in any way trying to claim that
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.700]  the margins there were different and that was bad. But, okay, I
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.140]  can't remember the last, I think the last time I bought a box
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:34.780]  piece of software was probably like, I don't know, like 1996.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:38.140]  How would you explain to somebody the idea? I mean, how
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:41.740]  would you even get box software onto a phone? I mean, you...
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:44.460]  Exactly, exactly. Well, that's the thing, too. I'm like, okay,
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:47.660]  I've been downloading and paying for mobile software. Okay, I do
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:52.860]  remember in the Palm days that you could buy a box
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.980]  software and you would install it on your computer and then
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:58.780]  you'd have to transfer it to your Palm. So I do remember
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:01.340]  that. But that was a very brief window. I mean, I think that
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:07.020]  from like basically 2005-ish, it's been digital distribution
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:10.540]  on mobile. Tech as an industry. And I'm generally loathe to
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:15.820]  just group all tech companies together. But tech, you know, if
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.620]  anything, my whole career is about parsing out the
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:21.020]  differences between tech companies. And there's a lot of
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:24.380]  nuances, but whatever. But tech as a whole, and those of us who
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.780]  are enthusiasts as a whole, we take it as a, my entire career
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:33.020]  is based on the idea that tech moves fast. It is fast and it's
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:36.540]  exciting. And so it's fun and exciting to follow. And it's
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:40.460]  changing our lives, not between generations, but within our own
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:43.020]  life. Right. I mean, we just, in the course of this show, we've
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.540]  talked about how different the world is from 20 years ago or 30
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:46.860]  years ago.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:49.660]  No, totally. I mean, exactly. And yeah, it moves fast. I mean,
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:52.140]  okay. And actually I will make a correction. I bought, I've
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:54.700]  bought like games. That's probably the one thing that I've
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:58.220]  continued to buy physical copies of not anymore, but probably
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.660]  well into the 2000s. And, you know, but anything else, I mean,
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:04.700]  even at this point, like, okay, computers don't have CDs on
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:09.820]  them. Like this era is over. It is all digital distribution to
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.100]  the point that the places that, you know, sell video games like
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:16.300]  physical video games are like at the risk of going out of
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:21.020]  business. So making the retail comparison, especially in a
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:25.260]  medium that has never existed, like the iPod was always digital
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:27.740]  only, you know, there was never a way where you were, you know,
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:30.700]  buying a physical MP3, like that would be a stupid idea,
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:33.340]  right? But you could buy a CD, put it in your computer and have
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:36.460]  iTunes zap it over your phone. And it was a fantastic
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:39.100]  experience. It was a great experience. But if you wanted to
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:42.460]  actually buy from the, but it was a great experience. But the
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:44.860]  big appeal and the big breakthrough of the iTunes store
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.580]  in 2003 was that I didn't have to do that.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:50.220]  Right. And that you could just buy a single, right?
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.860]  I could just buy a single just by one track. That was massive,
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:55.180]  right? Like that was like bringing what everybody had
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:58.540]  always kind of went to Napster for, right? Like was I can just
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.100]  do that. And I can I can do it digitally. I don't have to have
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:05.180]  the physical copy. So yeah, I think that making that
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:08.220]  comparison, it's like, well, yes, retail has much different
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:12.460]  margins. And it's a completely different thing. Like it's, to
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:17.500]  me, it also seems disingenuous when the issues at play are not
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:20.460]  about how Apple collects a commission on physical goods
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.100]  from retailers, because they don't. It's all about digital
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.820]  distribution. So why are you bringing retail into this?
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:30.380]  Right. And it completely skips over. And if there's one regret
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.620]  I have from my live talk show with Federighi and Jaws is that
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:37.980]  I didn't push back on Jaws on this point. It just didn't pop
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.020]  into my head, unfortunately, because I'm a very slow thinker.
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.780]  But my one regret is not pushing back on his response on
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:48.140]  this, which is along the same lines, which is that it, it
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:52.620]  presupposes that the transition from software being sold in
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:57.980]  boxes and other physical disks to the App Store doesn't have
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:01.020]  an intermediary step, which is that software could just be
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:05.260]  distributed digitally over the web without the App Stores,
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:09.660]  which Apple thrived. The entire early era of Mac OS X was
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:13.020]  entirely predicated on that. And that their entire in the
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:16.060]  indie Mac movement, I think the reason that people like like me
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:20.540]  like became massive Mac fans was based on that. I wasn't
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:24.220]  going to the few retail stores that existed like Apple retail
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:28.060]  stores and buying box software. I was finding apps online and
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:31.020]  downloading them and then paying for them. And it still is
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:35.020]  true today. It's not even like that was, you know, like retail
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:40.300]  software bygone era. The Mac App Store famously is nowhere
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:45.180]  near as successful as the iOS App Store. And it's, you know,
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:49.100]  an awful lot of great Mac software still is sold outside
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:53.420]  the App Store. And those companies are, you know, making
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:57.100]  money and there is it's a feasible business. I mean, I
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.660]  can't just sit here and even list this amount of software in
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:02.540]  my dock right now that I bought that way.
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:05.260]  Yeah, I mean, if anything, I think that there is like a
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.140]  knowledge because at least for those of us who are plugged in,
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:12.940]  we know what the cut can do. So at least for me, I go out of my
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.100]  way to buy the non App Store version, because A, I usually
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.580]  don't want some of the sandbox restrictions if those exist.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:24.700]  And B, I want to like directly support the developer, you know,
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:28.220]  like at which I realize, you know, that it's different on
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:31.580]  mobile. And I'm not even I'm not even necessarily like a
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:35.740]  proponent of having a sideloading ability. I think
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:38.140]  that's interesting, but I'm not even necessarily a proponent of
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:43.100]  that. But I think on desktop, I mean, desktop, I am for sure.
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:47.180]  But that's my basic my stance is that the Mac is the Mac and
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:51.100]  therefore is the Mac and and, you know, other PC platforms
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:53.740]  like Windows should be like that, too. And that phones are
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:56.700]  phones and that it's okay for the phone to be effectively a
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:59.980]  computer console. And it just in the same way that I think it's
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.380]  fine that the consoles are all like that, that you know,
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:06.140]  there's no there's no way to put homebrew sideloaded apps on
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:09.420]  a PlayStation without, you know, cracking it like
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:11.580]  jailbreak. Exactly. Well, that's the thing, right? Like,
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:14.380]  that you have to wait for those things to happen in those
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:16.700]  communities, you know, crop up. And that's great. But that's
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:21.260]  like gaming PC is a gaming PC. And you could make your own
[02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:23.740]  game, you can do mods, right? You can do mod, which are very
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:26.940]  popular. And that's the distinction. And that's, that's
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:29.580]  fine. I think that they it's okay to be separate. So yeah, I
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:33.420]  think that, you know, you're exactly right. It's not as if
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:37.740]  that middle area of being able to go and buy directly hasn't
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:40.620]  existed. And it's also frankly, it's not as if I mean, there
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:43.260]  were mobile app stores beforehand. And yeah, you know,
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:47.660]  the the carrier based ones were really egregious. But I mean,
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:51.660]  none of them ever took off the way but there were still
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:54.300]  usually ways you could get applications otherwise, like I
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:57.660]  used to sideload things on to like my Sony Ericsson phones
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:00.380]  and on my razor, you know, like you could find like jar files
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:02.860]  and stuff and, you know, it's ridiculous things you would do.
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.780]  So, yeah, it just I feel like that's that's the one argument
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:10.140]  where I'm like, okay, retail's different. And that's a straw
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:14.380]  man. If you have, if there are better arguments to make, I
[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:16.620]  would hope that they would make them but if all you're saying
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:19.900]  is Ticketmaster does it too, and everybody else charges 30%
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:23.340]  and everybody else makes you go through the app, like since
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:27.020]  when has been the argument for Apple anything been everybody
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:30.940]  else? Right? It's just like everybody else. That's, you
[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:33.500]  know, that's Apple just like everybody else. That's, that's
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:36.620]  the opposite of Apple, right? Like, why not do it the other
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:39.900]  way? And and why not, you know, and isn't there, you know,
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:43.180]  whatever happened to bragging about the App Store being the
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:47.180]  first app store and you know, again, you know, it's typical
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.780]  Apple Steve Jobsie and we did when we did it. It's the first
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.820]  one that counts like, ignoring the fact that there were things
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.380]  for the Palm Pilot and whatever going back further that were
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:59.500]  maybe App Store like and predecessors and arguably isn't
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:02.940]  first. But Apple's stance is that the App Store revolutionized
[02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:06.380]  everything for mobile phones, and in large part, mostly true.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.380]  So I think that's completely true. Why not take
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:11.740]  responsibility for the fact that the 70 30 split that
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:15.180]  everybody follows is quite probably mostly because that's
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.300]  what you do. You know, it's not like, oh, we're just one of
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:21.420]  these 70 30 people. We don't know how it happened, but we're
[02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:24.540]  you know, everybody's in the same bus. Well, the bus has a
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.740]  big Apple logo on it called the App Store. It's like the bus
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:33.100]  started literally with you built the bus, created it. No, I
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:34.940]  totally agree. I was thinking that too when I was reading
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:37.260]  this. I was like, yes, everyone does this because they've all
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:41.340]  followed your lead. And what's interesting is that if they
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:45.900]  made this very, I think would be a good decision, that would
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:50.380]  also force everyone else to follow their lead, which, okay,
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:53.660]  I just had this thought. This is sort of interesting. So if
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:57.500]  Apple were to cut their commission rate, and presumably
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:00.860]  then lose whatever their potential revenue could be, if
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:03.580]  Google has to do that too, and Microsoft has to do that, and
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:06.780]  any other kind of stores have to do that, that also cuts
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:10.380]  their effective, you know, service revenue rate, meaning
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:12.860]  that when we're talking about like our share price and
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:15.580]  things like that, like all things being relative, guess
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:18.620]  what, like Apple still has the advantages that Apple has.
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:22.380]  Yeah, I just I just see it as something that they could do
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:24.780]  and get buy-in from shareholders. All they have to do
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:28.860]  is spin the right story. And then spin as a bad connotation
[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:32.780]  as a verb, but you know, just put it in, you know, be honest
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.340]  about it. I think there's an honest explanation about it
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:38.540]  that shareholders would buy into. No, I mean, I think
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:40.860]  they were simple as saying this is the right thing to do.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:42.620]  And this is the right thing for the future of our business.
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:46.220]  Shareholders are going to be fine. And unless you could
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:50.300]  show a demonstrable, you know, say like this change has
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:53.100]  negatively impacted revenue, like where we're losing money
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:56.860]  and we're losing things, then I don't think anybody would
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.860]  go crazy. And honestly, if it were, if that were to happen
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.740]  and they needed to recalibrate, do the G4 thing, right?
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:08.780]  Like, I don't know, it's hard to be agile when you're as
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:11.020]  big of a company as Apple. And I can't even imagine trying
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:13.660]  to make those decisions when, you know, you have that many
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:16.460]  employees and that much revenue you're responsible for.
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.260]  That to me is, that's what would make Tim Cook a great
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:21.740]  CEO. And again, I'm not saying he's not. That makes it sound
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.780]  like I'm saying he's not. But the bigger the ship, the faster
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:28.540]  you can turn it is proof that you're, you're really, you know,
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:31.260]  you can turn on a dime, right? That's the thing.
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.500]  All right, let me take a break and thank our third and final
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:40.140]  sponsor. New sponsor, Raycon. Raycon makes earbuds and they
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:43.100]  started about half the price of other premium wireless

[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:57.500]  compact design that gives you nice noise fit, isolating fit.
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:00.460]  Raycon's wireless earbuds are comfortable, perfect for

[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:12.380]  it, they're good for it. Unlike other wireless options, Raycon
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:15.660]  earbuds are discreet with no dangling wires or stems to
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:19.580]  distract anyone during video calls, very discreet appearance.

[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:56.140]  before we move on? I have two other topics. I know we've gone
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.300]  long. I appreciate your time. We've gone super long, but no,
[02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:01.420]  no, no, no problem. All right. Let me toss this out. Aaron
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:09.100]  Seppenwall wrote a story. I don't know. Alan Seppenwall, I'm
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:13.020]  sorry, at Rolling Stone TV, Rolling Stone TV critic, calling
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:16.300]  out the terrible user interfaces of most streaming services.
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:19.980]  Yeah. This sounds dangerous. This sounds like we could do a
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:24.060]  whole show on it. But we could. We'll be brief. Here's my
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:26.940]  thought. What is a good streaming interface? My
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:29.420]  favorite. I have one answer that I can think of that I
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:32.300]  could think you know what, I don't even know how I would say
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:34.940]  you're good. But I don't want to say what it is yet. I'll ask
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:37.340]  you, who do you think is doing a good job?
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:42.060]  Okay, I actually do think that Netflix is doing a relatively
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:48.060]  good job. Relatively. My problem with Netflix is so it
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:51.580]  just I know it's the top of my mind. Amy and I are watching
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:55.020]  we're like one episode to go of the Innocence Files, which is
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:58.380]  fantastic. If I were going to do a segment of the show where I
[02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:00.700]  recommend something to watch, I'd say, Oh my God, watch the
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:04.300]  Innocence Files. It's like a nine episode miniseries on the
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:08.300]  Innocence Project. And, you know, obviously years in the
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.060]  works, but to come out now at this moment in our political
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:17.820]  climate about, you know, the police, you know, in America and
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:21.340]  prosecution and the criminal justice reform that's necessary.
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:25.820]  My God, this is it. You cannot. The luck they have that this
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:29.100]  show came out when it did is just unbelievable. Great show.
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.700]  Nine episodes. Every single time we go to watch it. What's
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:37.100]  at the top of our Netflix? Not the next episode of the
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:41.100]  Innocence Files. It's something else that Netflix has new to
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:46.060]  promote. And it's not hard. So the hey, Netflix is pretty good
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.300]  is that I can go like down twice and it's like continue. And
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:53.500]  there it is at the top of my continue list the next episode.
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:58.380]  But why? It should be at the top. No, I agree with that.
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:00.940]  Okay, so I'm trying to think because most of them are
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:03.660]  terrible. And so I'm trying to think what is the least worst?
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:06.860]  I mean, the app, the Apple TV Plus interface isn't bad. My
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:09.900]  only issue with that is that it's mingled in with all the
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:13.500]  other things. Yeah. So I don't have access to just the Apple
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:16.700]  TV Plus content, which I would like. Yeah, right. There's like
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:21.100]  a little bit. It's like, I think given what they're trying
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:25.180]  to do, the TV Plus interface is actually pretty good. But
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:29.740]  there's too many that what they're trying to do is include
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:32.380]  content from other sources that they don't have complete
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:36.540]  control over, right? Right. And I love that idea. I like having
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:39.420]  that centralized kind of organic watch list. My only
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.740]  issue is that if I want to watch the morning show, if I
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:45.180]  want to watch like another like Apple TV Plus content, I would
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:48.620]  like to see all of their yeah, they're too humble about the TV
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.740]  Plus content. I would like to see them have just a TV Plus
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:55.020]  app where it's just the Apple content. It's I would love that
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:57.180]  and I think that would be good to that point. This is okay.
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:00.540]  This is what I'll say. And it's funny cuz it's going away in a
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:06.380]  couple of days. I actually think that the pre HBO Max HBO Go
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:11.660]  slash HBO Now interface was really good. Huh? I'm an HBO Go
[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:15.340]  user. I am already I think I've successfully deleted it in
[02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:20.540]  anticipation of it being put to bed at the end of the month for
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:26.220]  HBO Max. I haven't used the HBO Max one as much. I find it hard
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:30.460]  sometimes though like to in HBO Go to find my favorite shows
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:33.660]  like cuz I only watch, you know, I don't watch all of it, you
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:36.060]  know, but it's like, hey, every Sunday night, I watched the John
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:40.380]  Oliver show. So why isn't that? Why is it so hard to find? Yeah,
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.260]  I mean, I guess the thing I like about it is that of all the
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.740]  services, it's the one that does the least amount of like
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:49.820]  algorithmic stuff. So it's basically you have a search, it
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.700]  puts things in collections and categories. There is hand
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:55.100]  curation, which is really good. I can see like, you know,
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:58.460]  documentaries or sports things or other stuff I might like. So
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:02.060]  that I guess it would be my pick. But again, I mean, this
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:07.500]  is Danny with with faint praise. I really and I subscribe to, I
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:11.420]  mean, like a truly disgusting number of streaming services.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:17.500]  So yeah, I mean, like, I, I started, I actually, I started
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:20.780]  recently, I've started a spreadsheet where I've, I'm
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:24.620]  tracking everything I'm subscribed to. And it is. It's
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:27.500]  ridiculous. Like every newsletter, whether I pay for
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:30.780]  it or not, but most of them I pay for it. No, same for me
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:34.140]  when it comes to immediate like me and and and Neelai Patel of
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:36.620]  The Verge often joke with one another that we're like the
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:40.380]  only two remaining like cable subscribers. Oh, I am too. Okay,
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:43.660]  so there's three of us we have we have we should have like a
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:47.740]  therapy group because we're the only three left because we're
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:50.380]  we're the biggest source of idiots because we not only
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:53.900]  subscribe to the cable stuff, but we also subscribe to the
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:55.420]  other services like that's
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:58.060]  All right, let me just let me just tell you this is why I'm
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:00.860]  still subscribed to cable and I still have we have a like it's
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:03.900]  now old I forget what but the model name of our TiVo is but
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:07.740]  our TiVo has effectively infinite storage and it has a
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:12.540]  remote that always works. Pause and fast forward are always.
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.620]  It's the best. It's still I still don't understand why
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:17.100]  nobody else has fast forward and rewind at work as well as
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:20.860]  TiVo. I agree TiVo was was the best. Okay, this is funny
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:23.340]  because now we you me and Neelai are also the only three people
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:26.460]  who have a TiVo. I let yesterday I'm not going to talk
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:30.380]  sports but I did yesterday the baseball season started and the
[02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:33.420]  Yankees were on against the Washington Nationals. It was a
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:36.460]  national game nationally televised game on ESPN so I
[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:39.660]  could watch it. I had two choices. I could watch on my
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:44.300]  TiVo through the ESPN channel I get or I could watch on the
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:48.700]  ESPN app on Apple TV and I you know nerd that I am between
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:51.020]  innings like the second and third inning. I switched from
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:55.420]  the TiVo to the ESPN app now. No surprise. I haven't used the
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:59.900]  ESPN app is oh, I guess I did. I watched the Michael Jordan.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.660]  Yeah, I was going to say I watched 30 for 30 on it.
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:05.420]  That's all I do. I watched the Michael Jordan show. The
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:08.460]  Last Dance. The Last Dance. But I haven't watched sports. I
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:11.580]  haven't watched sports on ESPN app in many months because
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:15.100]  there haven't been any sports. Anyway, guess what you can't do
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:19.660]  in the ESPN app. You can't pause. You cannot pause. You
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:22.620]  cannot fast forward. You can't go back. So if you like miss
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.980]  something in the baseball game, I went to like go back a pitch.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:28.540]  You know, let me go back. Let me see that again. There's no
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:31.180]  it's it's like watching old-fashioned TV. There is no
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:34.460]  there's no DVR aspect at all. It's not just a bad fast
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:38.140]  forward. You're right. There's none. There's no pause. Which
[02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:41.820]  means that we have effectively like regressed 20 years. Now
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:45.100]  they do have all of the features as far as I could do.
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:48.540]  This is on Apple TV in the ESPN app. All of the features they
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:52.780]  have about like when I click the trackpad on the TV remote,
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:56.460]  we're about adding a second thing so I can like do like
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.740]  three up or four up, you know, and I could put four games on
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:01.900]  it once. Well, guess what? There weren't four games on it
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:05.020]  once. There's one game. One game in the whole world is
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:07.260]  being played. It was the Yankees and Nationals. There
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:10.460]  wasn't anything to put up. That is interesting. You can't do
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:13.740]  that on TV. I can't watch four games. I don't want to watch
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:16.460]  four games at once. I want to watch one game. You can't
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:21.180]  pause. What? What the hell? I got out of that so fast. Went
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.300]  back to TV and I thought this is why I still pay for cable.
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:28.460]  You know, like $300 a month. Yeah. No, I'm in a similar
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:31.180]  situation like Comcast. Well, I don't get their internet.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:34.860]  Although I'm about to. Oh, God help you. Well, no, no, no, no.
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.380]  Here's why I'm doing it. I'll go on a brief tangent on this.
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:41.420]  I pay for fiber through Wave G. They're fantastic. Not
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:45.020]  getting rid of them, but my bill will actually be cheaper
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:48.140]  if I add a cable service, a cable internet service I don't
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:52.300]  use onto it. Ah, that's yeah. Where are the regulators?
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:55.340]  Where are the regulators? Anyway. Exactly. Anyway, okay,
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.500]  so what's what's the one good interface? Is it TiVo? Is that
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:01.500]  no no because I wouldn't count that um and and actually TiVo's
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:04.220]  interface is terrible. It's once you're watching a show in
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:07.900]  TiVo, it's it's the best ever the the totally but the other
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:09.900]  the rest of it used to be so good, right? They've they've
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:13.100]  really like managing everything else is horrible. No, it's the
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:16.700]  it's Apple's movies app and I guess that doesn't count as
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:20.220]  streaming. I think technically streaming is you pay a
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:22.540]  subscription and you watch all you want for free and the
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:26.060]  movies app is you pay for movies as you rent and buy them
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:28.140]  but to me, what the hell are you talking about? It's the same
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:30.380]  **** thing. No, I would agree with that. I think the Apple's
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:33.260]  movies app because I am. It's fantastic. Here's fantastic.
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:37.660]  Here's what's popular. Here's what's new and if you paused a
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:43.180]  movie last night, here it is. Pick it up. It is the interface
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:47.100]  that is like everybody forgets it and I don't know if it's
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:50.220]  because everybody has effectively decided. I'm
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:53.900]  spending. I'm spending so much on subscriptions every month.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:57.740]  There's no way I'm paying a rental fee for something else.
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:00.460]  I get, you know, whatever. They don't look at it but the that
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:04.300]  movies app is so good in my opinion. I would be very hard
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:08.700]  pressed to all of these other apps. I would love to spend an
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.500]  afternoon with their team and tell them what annoys me about
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:15.580]  Oh, the same peacock. I like did a mini Twitter thread and I
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:19.180]  had to give up because oh man, it's it's it's so bad and
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:22.700]  what's actually terrible about that is that the base NBC app
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:25.980]  pretty good. Yeah because I've used that. I've used that to
[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:29.180]  watch like I've used the NBC app to watch like uh oh
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:31.980]  somebody was somebody good was on The Tonight Show last night.
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:35.260]  Oh, I want to go back and watch that. I've used the NBC app.
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:39.820]  Um yeah, the peacock peacock app is bad. The Quibi app
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:44.700]  is actually kind of good on the phone, right? It's actually is a good
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:47.980]  app. It's just that everything else is so
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:51.260]  fakakta. It's like what the hell are you thinking about like
[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:54.380]  no it is I mean they did finally introduce the ability to do
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.740]  screenshots um after everyone's cancelled their subscriptions
[02:16:57.740 --> 02:17:00.620]  uh at least I I definitely did like I had the free trial and
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:03.340]  then I was like am I gonna I'm gonna pay $5 a month for this
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.060]  yeah no they they they you know that if you let people do
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:08.460]  screenshots that tells you everything you need to know
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:13.020]  about the Jeffrey Katzenberg mindset I know and and it's
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:16.540]  insane to me because he gets content right because there is
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:19.660]  but he didn't get the tech stuff there is there is some
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:23.260]  line that you want to draw between making
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:28.140]  piracy through your content difficult so difficult as to not be worth it
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:34.060]  but yet not interfering with the experience of your users and the
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:37.500]  benefits you can get from your users being able to take
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.340]  screenshots and tweet and promote it right there's a huge
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:44.780]  benefit of that and the idea that you would take
[02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:48.140]  advantage of technical features in the operating system to make screenshots
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:52.380]  technically impossible is the maximalist person you know you
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:55.740]  you couldn't possibly take and what is the idea that you're you've
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:59.500]  all right so you've paid all this money to put a Kevin Hart movie
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:05.740]  on Quibi and you think somebody is going to take a screenshot
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:10.220]  of what every frame of the movie exactly it's like it's like what are you doing
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:13.500]  you're ruining the ability to promote it's also like look the piracy is gonna
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:17.500]  happen like that that's that's a given what what you should do I mean the way
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:21.020]  that iTunes won the way that you know Netflix and those things ultimately won
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:27.740]  is if you make it more convenient to pay than to pirate most people
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:31.340]  will pay like there are it's always a subset of people who won't
[02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:34.620]  but I'm a strong believer and I say this as someone who has been a
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:38.780]  hardcore pirate but also someone who has been a hardcore buyer of media like my
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:41.820]  whole life it's been one of those things the reason I used to download torrents
[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:44.300]  all the time wasn't because I was cheap it was
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:47.500]  because I couldn't get the movie or the TV show any other way
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:51.020]  or they would put draconian restrictions on where I could watch them what I could
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:55.100]  do and I would get like just mad on principle so at this point
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:58.780]  you know there I it's easier for me to use a Usenet group than it is to rip
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:03.180]  my like thousands of blu-rays so okay like what if you like in the old days
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.700]  what if you pay for HBO but you really want to watch
[02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:10.460]  The Sopranos but you've got to watch on your laptop because you're not at home
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:14.860]  so what do you do exactly you do pay you pay for HBO you already pay for it but
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:18.380]  you can't get access so yeah you so the thing to me is like the best way to
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:22.460]  combat that is to make it more accessible um
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:25.900]  in in for something like Quibi where it's short it's like
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:29.580]  that wouldn't you that would open it up like if you let people do shifts and and
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:31.900]  let people you know tweet screenshots and do other
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:35.100]  stuff like it could go viral but when you don't do that
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:38.220]  now you can like you lose out on that whole thing so
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:41.260]  yeah I'm you're not wrong like not the rest of the app is
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:44.700]  is bad but the interface if you really want to if you want to get into the idea
[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:47.900]  that you're going to police the copyright of people posting
[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:53.500]  clips of Quibi shows you know by by taking a phone to video another phone or
[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:57.260]  taking a video you know because you know the the phones don't let
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.220]  you I guess you can record video now that I think about it but
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:03.660]  but you can do screen recording but the thing is they they but the but
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:07.020]  they will actually block that yeah but why can't but what do you think
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:09.420]  somebody's going to do with the screen recording of the show
[02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:12.220]  do you really think that they're going to pirate the whole thing I mean and
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:15.900]  it's like I would just love but I can almost see
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:19.180]  it I can almost see the the argument against not
[02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:23.100]  allowing screen recording of video clips of the thing because you know what if
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:26.220]  they spoil the best joke or whatever it's like but I would
[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:29.820]  that I'm not oh my god I'm not against that but a screenshot or at least create
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:33.420]  like an animated image you know what I mean I would love to sit in a meeting
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:36.700]  and listen to Jeffrey Katzenberg explain why they don't even let you take a
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:40.700]  goddamn screenshot I would just love to hear the explanation
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:43.900]  the justification yeah for they're ripping us off they're
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:48.140]  ripping right exactly you're paying us off that this free promotion is is bad
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:51.260]  um it's like you want it to go viral but you ruin every aspect
[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:54.860]  apparently that's been changed but I canceled my subscription I
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:59.420]  forgot to cancel my goddamn quibi subscription so they got they
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:02.860]  they got seven dollars for me or something I gotta cancel now
[02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:07.100]  and again you know what I do I set um reminders when I sign up for those
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:10.140]  things I like say like this one of the only times I use Siri
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:13.820]  I like basically tell Siri to remind me on a certain day
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:17.660]  you know to cancel it's a good app though that's the weird thing
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:21.980]  the phone version is good why in the world they don't support ipad is crazy
[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:26.380]  uh I I actually did not get it out in time before we record but perhaps
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:29.740]  before the show airs it'll be out as I want to rant about the fact that the
[02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:33.180]  ipad it's always been weird launching uh
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:35.980]  iphone only apps on ipad because they don't rotate
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:39.420]  and they're you have a choice between a 1x size with
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:44.220]  enormous letterboxing around the side which looks ridiculous on ipad
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:48.380]  or 2x which does take up most of the screen but not all but
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:54.140]  scales in an ungainly way that way yeah and but it it's always been awkward
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:57.740]  always been weird it's still with us but now you can dock
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:02.460]  your ipad in a magic keyboard that apple sells for 300
[02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:07.180]  and puts it in a laptop configuration it's obviously officially sanctioned
[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:09.980]  because the trackpad support is in the os and
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:14.380]  apple's the one selling you the 300 docking keyboard laptop thing
[02:22:14.380 --> 02:22:19.340]  and now when you launch say quibi which is still iphone only on your ipad
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:25.340]  it launches sideways and the entire user interface goes sideways
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:28.780]  like so if you command tab out of quibi it's
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:32.700]  up and down and if you drag the dock out it's on the side
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:36.380]  and everything is sideways like how is that not a bug
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:39.580]  if you're using a real laptop and everything goes sideways
[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:43.020]  you'd say oh i've got a weird video bug let me quick get a
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:46.300]  camera this haha my video card thinks the screen sideways
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:50.540]  that's actually by design i know and what's even worse about this is if you
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:53.420]  think about slide over and if you think about the fact that like that's how
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:56.620]  they're doing you know multi-windows stuff like okay why can't you have a
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:59.820]  slide over thing that is on screen right like it like
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:01.900]  a picture in picture menu or like a slide over that is
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:06.380]  just like the the phone you know either whatever orientation you're in either
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:09.980]  you know one way or the other so it's showing up correctly um it's showing you
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:12.620]  know uh maybe uh vertically when your ipad is
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:15.180]  is uh horizontal and it's just kind of docked
[02:23:15.180 --> 02:23:17.820]  you know at some place on your screen because i assume that's what they're
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:19.980]  going to have to do when they bring the apps
[02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:24.380]  to the mac is that it's going to have to be because you can't turn your mac
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:28.300]  so it's going to have to be some sort of window that you're seeing it's not
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:30.460]  going to be uh you know some of them might be
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:33.980]  converted but most of them they're going to be plenty of apps that won't be
[02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:37.580]  um developers won't go through the process of you know trying to make them
[02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:41.100]  work in in a four by three or you know
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:44.780]  whatever the yeah what if what if netflix i don't think they're
[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:48.460]  going to but what if netflix says okay fine we're not going to do a native mac
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:53.580]  app but we will let our ios app run on the mac in this new world
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:56.620]  well obviously you want to watch that sideways right you want to watch it
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:24:00.220]  landscape so i how do you do that on a device that
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.260]  doesn't tilt my guess i don't know i don't even think
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:07.580]  has apple i don't think the dev kids support that yet um no they don't well
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:10.940]  what i imagine they'll do is that it'll that they would bring over the ipad app
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:14.140]  and it would just come over uh when it's when it's in in landscape
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:16.300]  mode you know that would be how the network that would work and then you
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:18.540]  could make it full screen my guess or what if they
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:23.020]  what if those i mean they obviously know that okay this is an ios
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:29.340]  app running what if those apps have a window control that includes a
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:32.460]  rotation button you know like the red yellow green buttons what if there's a
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:35.420]  purple one that you know which has gone unused since
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:38.540]  2000 steve jobs's goofy idea that a purple
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:41.980]  button would put your mac into single app single
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:45.900]  window mode put a purple button up there um you know
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:49.180]  that rotates the screen and then it would even work well with quibi
[02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.060]  right because it would be purple there you go it would be purple would be
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:54.460]  button yeah that's not that's not a bad idea but
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:56.060]  no that's gonna be interesting how they'll handle
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:25:00.060]  the rotation stuff my my thought is that phones it will default
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:03.260]  almost exclusively to vertical as long as that's
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:07.500]  a supportive orientation but it'll be docked it's
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:11.260]  it's appropriate for most and except for the ones where it's not and the ones
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:13.980]  where it's not it's a hundred percent inappropriate right
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:17.980]  games and video you know there's no i agree it well but again this is my point
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:19.980]  i think that for the phones that's what they'll do
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:23.740]  and for the ipad versions they will actually do the opposite where it'll be
[02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:27.260]  defaulting to horizontal or not horizontal yeah yeah horizontal the
[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:32.540]  state we're in right now 10 years into the ipad era of iphone
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:37.500]  apps on ipad it which is just as terrible as it ever was
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.220]  but yet more incongruous than it was when it was introduced because at least
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:48.140]  when it was introduced 10 years ago every ipad app was a full screen app
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:51.660]  and some of them didn't rotate and you always
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:55.420]  were i you know even though you remember the original ipad keyboard right like
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.460]  you had to dock it vertically right people forget that
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:05.260]  right um i still have one of those anyway all right so my idea is that
[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:09.740]  movies itunes movies is the only app that's actually good netflix is
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:14.380]  probably a second up i think tv apple tv gets credit for
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:17.420]  trying to put a cohesive interface on
[02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:21.180]  incohesive rules around where the content can come
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:24.700]  from where sometimes it'll just play the video and sometimes we'll launch
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:28.460]  the cbs all access app and jump you to the app
[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:31.820]  and then you go back and then instead of going back in the cbs
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:34.940]  app which is where you were you're back in the tv app and
[02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:39.660]  when what what happened i don't know trying to make sense of incoherent rules
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:43.740]  with a coherent interface they get extra credit but it is a bad interface
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:47.260]  overall yeah hulu is probably the worst which is a
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:50.700]  shame because it's the best service in my opinion and it's that the
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:54.380]  interface is just a disaster overlines they invented something called an
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:27:00.060]  overline to show you what's selected well so it's funny because what yeah
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:03.340]  right well what's what's funny is that when the first in the launch it's better
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:06.780]  than it was three years ago but when they showed me a preview of the
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:10.540]  ui at ces 2017 they were really proud and it
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:14.220]  looked really good on like a tv and like it looked like it
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:17.100]  could be well controlled from like a game controller and the screenshots you
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:20.220]  know were all good and then they were kind of going through it and i was like
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:23.820]  okay but this seems a little bit confusing and this is going to add a lot
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:27.260]  of stuff especially for anyone who's using like a
[02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:30.860]  tv remote and not a game controller like how how are you going to do this and
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:33.100]  they just assured me it's fine it's fine i was like
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:36.700]  i pushed back a little bit i was like all right whatever and it launched
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:42.860]  and you know the immediate like feedback was just like the user the
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:46.460]  revolt was almost like unlike anything i can remember the the
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:49.900]  comments we got at gizmodo on like how much people hated that interface
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:53.020]  and i know from talking to people at tivo like they felt it too that they
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:56.380]  started trying to not tivo hulu they started trying to make
[02:27:56.380 --> 02:28:00.620]  adjustments and changes but it's you know it's three years later and it's
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.180]  all the only thing i can say is that it's better
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:09.580]  but the old interface wasn't bad you know like they just yeah
[02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:13.180]  it's uh it's it's a mess um disney plus isn't bad
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:16.540]  actually no that's i i would say that's pretty
[02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:19.900]  good too i think that the hey they all stink argument is
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:22.940]  overstated uh and i don't want to say that alan
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:28.700]  sepawal's article is off base uh it's but it's not as bad as
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:32.860]  the hot take might have you think you know i agree plus is pretty good
[02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:36.060]  and and i think they get extra credit for launching
[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:41.100]  with a very good 1.0 a very good 1.0 the one thing i really
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:44.300]  love about disney plus was and a couple other apps do this too but
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.700]  they have a thing where if you do it on certain tv devices including the apple
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:51.820]  tv but also some samsung's and some other devices
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:55.260]  rather than having to go through the terrible rigmarole of having to
[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:58.700]  enter in your you know complicated password and email with
[02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:03.580]  you know like a tv remote um they don't even have the thing where you would have
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:05.340]  like you i guess have the option of doing the
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:07.500]  thing where you go to the website url and log in
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:10.780]  but instead they have a thing where they say okay do you have a phone near you
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:15.340]  that's logged in or that you have access to if you do open the app on your phone
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:19.100]  and then it'll use you know wi-fi or bluetooth or whatever to pair the two
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:22.700]  together and send in your credentials yeah and that was such a seamless
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:24.860]  experience like i remember i actually like
[02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:28.460]  like i tweeted it like i i went through the process like i saw it it was
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:31.740]  cool and i like went through it again so i could document it because i was like
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:36.620]  okay this is actually a really slick way to get around that so yeah no i'm
[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:38.940]  looking at the app now even on my phone like
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:42.220]  they have like kind of the the pillar you know categories they have the
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:45.660]  recommendations for you they have the continued watching area
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:49.820]  have the trending you know sections yeah yeah i think i think actually that the
[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:52.780]  disney app is is is quite good yeah and the other thing
[02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:54.940]  too is that they're not trying to sell you anything else
[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:58.460]  it's like you're already in you're already paid they're not there there's
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:01.580]  no you know and again i get it i do get it
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:04.940]  and i see the peacock ads where peacock's ads are all about like
[02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:07.260]  hey it is free it's free you can just here's
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:09.420]  finally here's a new streaming service for it's free
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:13.020]  of course it's because they got these unskippable commercials um right
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:16.860]  which it took me all of there i was trying to watch a movie just to test it
[02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:19.500]  out it took me all like because the first ad for the movies
[02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:22.780]  it's good right it's only you know it's like three minutes or whatever you have
[02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:25.340]  to watch at the beginning and then you watch the whole movie
[02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:28.380]  unprompted like without any ads i actually applaud that i think that's
[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:31.580]  fantastic i have been so re i've been so conditioned
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:34.940]  of 20 years of tivo and dvrs and on demand and
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:37.980]  and streaming and and downloading content whatnot
[02:30:37.980 --> 02:30:42.780]  that i was like i was i was like a little over a minute into my three
[02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:45.740]  minute wait period and i exited out of the app which
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:48.540]  doesn't play in the background and doesn't have picture in picture which is
[02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:51.420]  annoying and i like went to the website and i
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:55.340]  upgraded my like the plus version or premium version i get
[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:59.100]  via comcast and i was like yep paying five dollars a month for this i cannot
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.980]  deal with the ads yeah that was my story with the last dance
[02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:08.060]  where i forgot to tivo it uh went to waited too long to get it
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:11.100]  like on replay on espn so i watched in the app
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:14.700]  and they had they weren't quite unskippable but you still it's like this
[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:18.140]  this process of skipping was there such a pain in the ass but i also didn't have
[02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:20.940]  the patience to wait for it to come out on netflix where it is
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.300]  it actually just it just launched this week i was going to say and that's
[02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:26.940]  actually what they were trying to promote to me instead of the next
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:29.980]  episode of the innocence files i was like dude i watched that
[02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:32.620]  you're like i already watched this don't you know like show me the thing i've
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:35.580]  actually been watching you're like it's not a bad recommendation
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:39.020]  like good recommendation but not i've been watching the innocent files
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:42.380]  yeah it does remind me a little bit of the way cell phones were
[02:31:42.380 --> 02:31:46.940]  pre iphone where it was sort of like everybody had their own way of doing
[02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:48.780]  everything you know like even like texting
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:51.820]  and it's like totally you kind of had to learn it's like every time you get one
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:54.860]  of these new things like peacock and you're like where where what
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:57.980]  what which is so weird because there have been
[02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:02.300]  okay like okay i actually think that on the whole i think roku i'm not a big fan
[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:05.100]  i don't like the interface here's the one where area where i will
[02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:08.300]  kind of defend them and and they're kind of subpar interfaces because
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:12.300]  you know their hardware the apps for the most part have to still work on like
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:15.660]  really really old stuff and so some of the
[02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:20.540]  apps like amazon and and um you know uh netflix and hulu have customized to a
[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:24.060]  certain point but the rest of them follow a very
[02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:27.340]  common template and it's not the best looking thing
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:31.100]  but it works and you can navigate around it and it's a good 10-foot experience
[02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:35.420]  and i have to say like i think that my fire tv stick was a much better value
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:39.180]  and when i used to have to travel i would take my 4k fire tv stick with me
[02:32:39.180 --> 02:32:44.140]  everywhere because unlike an apple tv it would work with hotel wi-fi and now
[02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:48.300]  there's the apple tv app available on the um
[02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:52.380]  the amazon devices i could watch all of my purchased tv shows as well as
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:56.700]  their content um so you know that's a better value but the interface on the
[02:32:56.700 --> 02:33:00.380]  roku is like bare bones as it is i gotta give them
[02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:04.220]  credit at least for for the 10-foot experience uh you know
[02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:07.660]  i i don't know what what their mobile situation is like i know they have their
[02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:09.820]  own channels now i don't mess with that but
[02:33:09.820 --> 02:33:13.660]  the 10-foot experience on the tv itself i have to kind of give them credit it's
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:16.860]  it's bare bones but it does its job i had that
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:20.780]  you saying that made me think of the old apple tv the original apple tv
[02:33:20.780 --> 02:33:25.180]  before tv os and the way that even the netflix app every there weren't really
[02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:28.140]  apps they were like just things that look like experiences and
[02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:30.620]  they were all they'll apple made them all
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:33.980]  and so like the way that you watch netflix on apple tv wasn't with a
[02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:37.660]  netflix made app it was through an app apple made in
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:40.460]  their template that they did with the participation
[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:43.820]  of netflix to get the apis for netflix sign-in and content
[02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:47.180]  and everything had the same interface and the interface was actually pretty
[02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:50.460]  good and yeah yeah and all of a sudden i have
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:53.900]  this sense of loss i have this sense no no massively and
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:56.140]  what happened there and i know this for a fact because i actually talked to
[02:33:56.140 --> 02:34:00.620]  netflix about it at the time was that netflix wanted to own their
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.180]  user interface and they wanted it to be consistent
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:06.780]  across all platforms and look you know what from their perspective i understand
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:11.580]  like they have their own brand and they develop their own like you know
[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:14.140]  identity you want that everywhere so they you
[02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:16.620]  know when they could they started to update
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:19.900]  and and apple like even had to give them leeway and do
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:23.260]  certain things you know even within tv os that you
[02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:26.140]  might not otherwise be able to do and amazon's followed suit
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:29.980]  and it's a shame because i do think that having those constraints even if it made
[02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:32.700]  the apps like less flashy for screenshots and
[02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:35.100]  like look less good in sales presentations
[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:38.700]  from a user experience point of view so much better you just didn't have to
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:41.660]  think about it no all right well it's a good place to

[02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:21.020]  of the trash that is known as the bachelor and the bachelorette
[02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:24.140]  and i always use the hashtags specifically so
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:28.460]  people can mute me because otherwise like i know that i drive
[02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:33.340]  people out the wall so you usually usually a thinker and a fast
