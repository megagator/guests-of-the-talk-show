[00:00.000 --> 00:08.720]  90 minutes or bust. I think we have the title already. I remember when people used to complain
[00:08.720 --> 00:13.760]  when the show was over an hour. Yeah, I think you just gave up on it. I got better actually
[00:13.760 --> 00:19.200]  because someone was, someone recommended my podcast on Twitter, which I appreciated. And which
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.840]  I will add, because people are going to bitch that I'm recording with you and I haven't recorded
[00:23.840 --> 00:31.360]  an external summer. We're going to record the next episode later today. So I'm back. I'm podcasting.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.120]  But someone's like, oh yeah, but the problem is, you know, all those podcasts is going
[00:35.120 --> 00:39.520]  forever. They need some good editing. I'm like, I spend hours every week editing our podcast to
[00:39.520 --> 00:44.480]  keep it to an hour. Don't let me in with Gruber. I was very, I was upset. Well, I know what they mean
[00:44.480 --> 00:50.640]  now. And I, you know, it would be a very different show though. You know, it's, it's, have you heard
[00:50.640 --> 01:01.600]  it is the slack? It's called the slack variety pack. No, I don't think so. It's new. Yeah, slack
[01:01.600 --> 01:07.840]  variety pack. If you just Google slack for ID pack, you'll find it. So it's a podcast that slack
[01:07.840 --> 01:15.920]  is sponsoring. It's not the people who are making it or not slack employees, but they don't even
[01:15.920 --> 01:23.120]  get names or credit. And it is all, you know, as, as by design. But it's so, you know, it's sort of
[01:23.120 --> 01:32.720]  like, the way that like, I think, like, wasn't like the Milton Burl show like the Texaco star hour
[01:32.720 --> 01:37.520]  or something like that. The Texaco is something, you know, so it's just a podcast with the name,
[01:37.520 --> 01:44.480]  the slack variety pack. And there's very, very minimal slack promotion in it. But it's like each
[01:44.480 --> 01:52.000]  little 20 minute episode is like a series of three or four minute very edited like NPR style
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.600]  segments. It's sort of like NPR for nerds. And it's really good. I did an interview with
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.240]  them for an episode that's coming up, probably not in it, maybe like a month, seems like they're
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.200]  like a month ahead or something like that. But I listened to a few episodes before I agreed to do it
[02:07.200 --> 02:13.120]  and I was blown away. It's like a NPR very edited, tightly edited, which is great. And I love it
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.800]  and I've subscribed to the slack variety pack. And in theory, I could do a show that is similarly
[02:18.800 --> 02:27.520]  edited. I mean, and, you know, but I don't. But I think it's fine. I think it's fine though,
[02:27.520 --> 02:31.920]  because like, this ends up being, and you put it as like the director's commentary for
[02:31.920 --> 02:38.160]  during fireball, which, you know, is, is very tightly written and edited. So it kind of makes sense
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.440]  that that it's, it's the opposite. And yeah, I think both several, I mean, I mean, the talk show is
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.640]  great when you're like cleaning house or something. And it's, or I mean, now, you know, where I
[02:48.640 --> 02:54.160]  can't address you or driving or driving or walking on, you know, doing errand or something like that.
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.120]  No, it's exactly, to me, though, that those two forms are very traditional in in radio where
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.320]  NPR has been NPR and has done these tightly sits edited segments. I mean, for those of you outside
[03:04.320 --> 03:11.920]  the state's NPRs, the US is national public radio. And it's very, I would say, I think it's
[03:11.920 --> 03:18.160]  outstanding quality and very well regarded. And, you know, like they have shows like all things
[03:18.160 --> 03:25.040]  considered. And what was the show that was what's Ira glasses show, this American life is
[03:25.040 --> 03:31.760]  American life. Yeah. That are famous for, you know, the quality of the writing and the broadcasting,
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.600]  but also like they're tightly edited. And on the other side, they're, you know, talk radio has
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.920]  been a thing as long as there's been radio. And that's more like what my podcast is like,
[03:39.920 --> 03:46.320]  and most of the podcasts in, in our racket are like, it is, it is funny that I think we, we have
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.200]  this mini discussion every time I'm on because I think you, you've messaged me 90 minutes or
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.760]  bust. And I think I just replied at this straight LOL. I'm surprised I wasn't an emoji.
[03:55.760 --> 04:02.400]  Yeah. Well, I'm a rusty, I'm a little off my game. Yeah. What would be the, I'm jet like to,
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.320]  I'm jet like to all get out at 653. I'm here and I've been awake for like six hours. So
[04:06.320 --> 04:13.680]  it would be the emoji you would throw at me, the poop. Probably like the emoji with like the one I
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.400]  open in the tongue sticking out. All right. I got you. You've had a busy summer. You've been,
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.960]  you were traveling in the States. And now you're back on the other side of what do we,
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.160]  we call the Atlantic the pond. What do we call it? The Pacific is, is the big pond. I don't know.
[04:28.160 --> 04:33.920]  Big pond. It's, it's, it's a lot, it's a lot bigger than the Atlantic. I'm sure that's exactly
[04:33.920 --> 04:37.760]  what I know. In fact, I've done it. I know what it feels like when you're flying over it.
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.360]  I don't particularly rough on this time because, yes, I mean, it was just me and, in my two
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.480]  kids, my, my wife, every summer comes back a couple weeks early. We've only done two summers.
[04:48.480 --> 04:55.120]  Um, but that's like her, her annual vacation. She gets two weeks of milling around. Um, but, uh,
[04:56.880 --> 05:01.280]  I realized that I haven't done the like, because my parents are in the Midwest. So go from Chicago
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.680]  to Taipei. There's no direct flights. So you have to connect. And I, because prior to that,
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.720]  we were in Seattle. And then last year, we did an overnight stay in, in, uh, in Seoul, Korea on
[05:10.720 --> 05:16.000]  the way back. I hadn't done the like the one trip all the way in a while. And, uh, so I forgot
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.400]  just how brutal it was. And to make it worse, our flight going got moved forward an hour and a half
[05:20.400 --> 05:23.760]  and our flight going back out to late. So it actually ended up being 26 hours door to door.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.840]  Um, yeah. Two hours of the airport in Chicago. So yeah, it was, it was, it was rough. The kids
[05:29.840 --> 05:34.720]  were awesome. I mean, they're, they're pretty experienced at this point. But man, it was, it was hard.
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.680]  Oh, hair. Had to be a hair. Yeah. Yeah. My parents, my parents are in this weird spot. Like,
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.440]  they're just outside Madison, but the, to the south of Madison, where they're far enough from the
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.760]  Madison airport and close them to a hair, it doesn't make sense to fly from Madison, that you
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.920]  have to, but that means it's to drive two hours to a hair, which just adds a whole
[05:54.640 --> 05:59.920]  wear of stink on top of the entire endeavor. I was thinking of midway, which is all midway. It
[05:59.920 --> 06:05.360]  doesn't make any sense for an international travel. Yeah. I think that I hate Southwest,
[06:05.360 --> 06:09.360]  but I think most of it's because, uh, in Chicago, it's only midway. Yeah. Which is on the
[06:09.360 --> 06:16.000]  like the south side of Chicago. And it is just awful to get to. So, um, I, I, I sort off that.
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.800]  It's good though. If for me, I've liked it over the years because if it's good, if you just want
[06:20.800 --> 06:25.760]  to go to downtown Chicago, right, that's right. You'd fly in the mid and Southwest has
[06:25.760 --> 06:32.000]  tons of flights every day between fill in and midway. So you have tons of options. And, uh,
[06:32.720 --> 06:38.160]  and then you get off and you just walk right over to whatever the CTA and you get a card,
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.200]  you know, put 20 bucks on it. And it's like the end point for the, I think it's the orange line.
[06:43.200 --> 06:46.400]  You don't even have to like pay attention. You just get on an orange train and next thing you know,
[06:46.400 --> 06:50.160]  you're downtown. It's actually pretty good. But for anything else, you know, you gotta go to a hair.
[06:51.120 --> 06:56.000]  But it's best though. I mean, I mean, air travel, I mean, it sounds so cliche, but like, um,
[06:56.800 --> 07:03.680]  I used to swear off, um, you know, I, I, I've been doing this for what 13 years now. And I
[07:03.680 --> 07:08.240]  swore off ever flying US or I know the Pacific, but I've jumped full back in with United, uh,
[07:09.040 --> 07:14.240]  basically because they have all their, all their cross Pacific planes and I'll have Wi-Fi and power
[07:14.240 --> 07:19.120]  at their seats, which is, it's unbelievable. What did I mean? Yeah, I know the whole Wi-Fi thing
[07:19.120 --> 07:22.240]  has been done, but because they actually have satellite Wi-Fi, which works way better than that
[07:22.240 --> 07:28.160]  Google crap. And it's real. And it's, it's, it's stunningly cheap. It's like $16 or $17. And man,
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.480]  it just transforms, it transforms the whole flight. It's like, this is good.
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.800]  We're easily on pace for a 90 minute show since we haven't even touched any.
[07:36.800 --> 07:42.240]  Can I just tell you, I had the worst go-go experience ever a few weeks ago. I'm trying to
[07:42.240 --> 07:48.880]  remember if it was coming home from WWDC. That would be months ago, but it was sometime this summer,
[07:49.600 --> 07:54.160]  might have been coming home from WWDC. And Amy was out with me and we're coming,
[07:54.160 --> 08:00.480]  we're flying home on US airlines, uh, slash American, it's all one thing now, but they've,
[08:00.480 --> 08:05.360]  I don't know, they're like in this weird one boat and one foot and one boat and one foot and the
[08:05.360 --> 08:12.880]  other state right now. Um, we get on, I've, because of Philly, Philly is a huge US air hub,
[08:12.880 --> 08:17.200]  uh, and has been forever. So I mean, it's, that's where I'm platinum and that's where I fly all the
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.960]  time. Uh, and I always just booked my go-go when I get on the plane. That's what I've always done.
[08:22.960 --> 08:26.800]  And some, I've heard that you're supposed to book a day in advance or whatever. And I just never
[08:26.800 --> 08:31.200]  occurred to me. So we get on the plane and I'm looking at the go-go options and there are no
[08:31.920 --> 08:38.960]  options to get service for more than an hour, other than, and the hourly rate was, was,
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.000]  uh, I don't know, honoris it was really expensive, other than signing up for a monthly subscription.
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.760]  And then you can't, and then you can't unsubscribe. Right. Yeah. When you get a monthly subscription
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.320]  to go-go, uh, there is no way to cancel it. You have to call them or you can't do
[08:56.320 --> 09:02.320]  from a flight. Um, and it's 50 bucks. Oh, they're, they're a terrible, they're a terrible company.
[09:02.320 --> 09:08.160]  I mean, it's, it seems criminal, but I did have a flight later that month and I knew I was flying
[09:08.160 --> 09:12.080]  at the, it was, it had to be WWDC because I knew it was, it was June and I knew I was flying
[09:12.080 --> 09:18.160]  again at the end of June. And I thought, you know, it actually would work out almost, you know,
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.960]  like the 50 bucks isn't that bad. So I did it. Um, I felt so bad, but I was watching, it was so fun.
[09:24.960 --> 09:31.120]  It felt bad, but I was watching this woman one row up across the aisle from me on her tablet.
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.680]  Um, and I think it was actually, it was interesting for a few reasons. I think I, I think it was a,
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.760]  a Kindle tablet, not an iPad and it's very unusual for me to see people using tablets on,
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.720]  you know, regular consumer type people using consumers or an iPads. And all she was doing was over
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.480]  and over and over again, trying to get on the wifi and get them, you know, just let me pay for
[09:50.480 --> 09:55.840]  wifi for this flight. And she's looking at the options. And she's like, and I could see, and she
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.360]  was like reading all the fine print and thinking, you know, I could see what she was thinking,
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.080]  you know, that there must be some little fine print thing, like click here to just get a pass for
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.840]  this flight. And she couldn't find it. She spent like 25 minutes trying to sign up for a wifi.
[10:10.640 --> 10:13.680]  What's bad is, I mean, obviously, I have a monopoly and captive audience,
[10:13.680 --> 10:19.280]  sort of stuff and all, you know, no real incentive to provide decent service. But the, uh, the thing
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.560]  that's kind of nasty is I used them, um, I used to use them a lot when I used to travel a lot,
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.200]  uh, with Microsoft. And so I like a monthly account order like that. And so I experienced the
[10:29.200 --> 10:37.360]  impossible to cancel thing. Um, but they now, if you sign up, they opt you into storing your credit
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.840]  card with them and give you no option to opt out. Right. And so like they will keep your credit
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.280]  card no matter what. And then so I, I, I bought it and then I logged in and immediately remove my
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.440]  credit card. And you used to say 40s later again, return flight and my credit card is still there.
[10:52.160 --> 10:58.640]  So not only do they opt you in without without giving you an option, they actually failed or lied
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.280]  to actually remove when I told them to. Yeah, they're, they're an awful company. And the satellite
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.520]  based stuff is so much better. I think they're watching satellite service, but yeah, I hope they die.
[11:07.520 --> 11:13.280]  I mean, they're, they're really bad. The only thing that's good about the monthly plan is it seems
[11:13.280 --> 11:19.920]  like if you, if you do agree to this $50 a month thing, you can then like have your laptop on
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.440]  and get your, if you're put it away under a seat or something and then you get out your iPhone,
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.600]  you can get on with your iPhone. And then when you go back to your iPad, it's still on as opposed
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.640]  to the every time you log on with a second device, you're logged out of the previous device.
[11:34.640 --> 11:40.240]  Oh, interesting. That's nice. Yeah. For sure. All right. Well, we're, we're, we're not going to,
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.040]  we, we have to do this. Not any minute things. We're going to get it. We'll make it. Best best
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.200]  like that, not like anything happens in August. So best customer service flight experience I've
[11:49.200 --> 11:56.400]  ever had was a Southwest flight out of, um, uh, out of Midway. And it was at one of the C4 conferences.
[11:56.400 --> 12:04.240]  So it's probably like 2007 or 2008. And in Philadelphia, the subway lines are colored. And like
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.120]  the blue line runs, uh, east, west, orange line runs north, south. And there aren't, there aren't
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.920]  multiple colors on the same track. And I knew from previous years that to get out to Midway,
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.320]  there's a, I knew which it was this, you know, because it was the same hotel. You go to this station,
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.680]  go up the steps and, uh, take an orange train on the right. And that'll be going the right
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.080]  direction. I was, I remembered it. And so it was me and another guy who was at the conference,
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.400]  actually. And, um, actually, I guess I was the one who raced up, I raced up the stairs and there
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.960]  was a train already there. And I was like, this is my lucky day. And I jump into the train and I
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.000]  look and I recognized a face from the C4 conference, like somebody else who attended didn't know
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.240]  I think he knew who I was. So I sat down and we just started talking. And you know, we made quick
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.680]  friends and it was a great way to pass the time. And then all of a sudden I thought, you know, this
[12:53.680 --> 13:01.440]  is taking longer than it usually does. We like, we look out the window and it does not look anything
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.840]  like what I remember the trip to Midway looking. And it ends up that in Chicago, they have multiple
[13:05.840 --> 13:13.200]  colored trains that take the same. Right. Right. Maybe it was my fault. It might have been that
[13:13.200 --> 13:17.680]  we were going up the steps together and I told him, quick, you know, now that I think about it.
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.240]  If you're out there, if you're down in the loop, yeah, they're all in the same track.
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.160]  I don't remember this fellow's name, but if you're out there listening to the show and you're
[13:26.160 --> 13:33.040]  remember this, I'm very sorry. Well, it ends up, we were way out in North Chicago and it was not a
[13:33.040 --> 13:40.560]  good neighborhood. And we asked, got off, we're recognizing our state got off and I asked at CTA
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.680]  and play, hey, what's the best way we can get a cab? And they were like, get back on the train
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.920]  and go all the way back downtown. And I'm like, are you joking? And they're like, there are no
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.480]  cabs out here. There's no cabs. So that's really, and I was like, are you serious that that's like
[13:56.480 --> 13:59.440]  the best way? And they're like, yeah, the best way for you to get the midway would be to get back
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.520]  on the same train. You were just on going the other way, go all the way back down to where you were
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.520]  and wait for the train that you should have gone on. So in doing this, I picked up my cell phone
[14:09.520 --> 14:15.840]  and called Southwest and I'm thinking, I am screwed. I'd, you know, and, you know, during
[14:15.840 --> 14:20.880]  Fireball was just barely off the ground, like, you know, rebooking for hundreds of dollars more
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.400]  was going to be seriously like an expense that it was not prepared for. I call Southwest and tell
[14:26.400 --> 14:33.600]  them. And the woman says, I got, I have another flight leaving 70 minutes after the one you were on.
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.920]  How about that one? And I was like, yeah, how much is going to cost? She was nothing. I was like,
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.840]  really? And she was like, yeah, it's the same price. So don't worry about it. That will make you,
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.960]  that will make you a, a happy customer for a very long time. I was like, that's, I'm going to be
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.480]  about an hour late. So that is absolutely perfect. And she was like, okay, thanks for flying Southwest.
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.960]  And it, it took like three minutes and I went from having an absolutely horrible day to having
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.760]  what I actually felt better than if I just made my flight. That's the thing, that is the thing about
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.640]  customer service that that there's two things. I think about customer service and also about like
[15:08.640 --> 15:15.040]  just buying stuff. That makes such a difference. I mean, a good service experience can actually
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.120]  make something better than it was originally. Like, even if you're dealing with a broken product or
[15:19.120 --> 15:24.480]  something like that, I had to do the, you know, I had to do the, the, I also got my ampowattry
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.600]  place. I think we, we talked about this on Twitter or whatever. The tactic engine was failing.
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.480]  But yeah, I mean, it's still, it's still not the, you walk in and they give you a new one on the spot
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.400]  because they now they have to mail them in with the watches. But still, it took two days
[15:38.400 --> 15:44.240]  and they called me up and they gave me a brand new watch. And like the fact I didn't have to like
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.960]  hassle them about it or like, you know, it's, it's just, it makes a big difference for sure.
[15:50.640 --> 15:54.320]  But that, it's interesting that you mentioned the, the, I'm going to, I'm going to hijack the
[15:54.320 --> 15:58.640]  conversation. Okay. Um, because why you're here? I was the big thing about if you were up in the
[15:58.640 --> 16:03.120]  middle of nowhere was now you could call an Uber much more easily and they're, they're much better
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.480]  at serving, you know, serving underserved areas than, than caps have ever been. Yeah. Um, I do,
[16:08.480 --> 16:14.080]  I wonder about that. Yeah. Well, well, the Uber things in general, but I do hope at some point
[16:14.080 --> 16:20.960]  we get to the, um, the Uber, this is a long extended segue to like cars and ride sharing and all this.
[16:20.960 --> 16:28.560]  And I am, I would love to get your thoughts about the, the seemingly all but confirmed Apple
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.440]  car because I am still a little baffled about the whole thing. But we don't give you now, but I,
[16:33.440 --> 16:40.000]  I, I would love to. Yeah. Well, uh, why don't I take a moment here as we, as we rock it towards
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.320]  our 90 minute, uh, episode line, I'll take a moment here and thank our first sponsor. And then
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.000]  we can do that. We can just talk about the Apple car stuff that's popped up in the last month or so,
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.760]  because I don't think I've talked about it. And I know you haven't because, um, you've been off
[16:53.760 --> 16:59.200]  there. But let me take a moment and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at Harry's,
[17:00.400 --> 17:06.560]  uh, go to Harry's.com and use promo code the talk show and you'll say five bucks off your first
[17:06.560 --> 17:13.200]  purchase. What do they sell? Harry's offers high quality razors and blades for a fraction of the
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.960]  price of the big name razor brands. Harry's was started by two guys who wanted a better product
[17:18.960 --> 17:24.160]  without paying an arm and the leg. Um, the story I remember hearing was that one of the founders was,
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.200]  you know, like traveling or something for goddess razor went into, you know, the drug store,
[17:29.200 --> 17:34.320]  big name drug store right next to the hotel he was staying at. And couldn't even get it because the,
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.840]  the blades and everything were locked behind those plexiglass cabinets with a padlock and you
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.000]  have to find an employee of the store and get him to come over and unlock the padlock and then
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.760]  you get to actually buy the stuff and it's like, why can't I just buy this stuff? Um, and that's
[17:49.760 --> 17:55.360]  where he got the idea that, you know, this is perfect thing to sell online. Um, really, really
[17:55.360 --> 18:00.560]  serious company though, they make their own razor blades. They bought an old blade factory in
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.080]  Germany. They were buying the blades from them and they liked the blades they are getting so much.
[18:04.080 --> 18:10.560]  They just bought the factory. It must be nice if you can do that. These are high quality,
[18:10.560 --> 18:15.280]  high performing German blades crafted by shaving experts, giving you a better shave that
[18:15.280 --> 18:21.120]  respects your face and wallet. They offer factory direct pricing. That's how they, that's how
[18:21.120 --> 18:26.960]  they sell these, these quality blades so much cheaper because they make them in their factory
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.320]  and then they package them up and then they just ship them right to you. And there's no middle
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.440]  man, no distributors, no retailers, nothing like that. That's how they cut the price in half and it
[18:35.440 --> 18:41.920]  really is about half the price. Their starter set is an amazing deal. 15 bucks gets you a razor,
[18:42.560 --> 18:50.240]  moisturizing shave cream or gel, your preference and three razor blades. I got my starter kit
[18:50.240 --> 18:54.400]  years ago, whenever you listen and to show for a long time, you know how long Harry's has been
[18:54.400 --> 19:00.000]  a sponsor. They sent me one of these years ago when I first got started and I looked at it recently,
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.360]  it looks brand new. It looks absolutely like mint condition. It really does hold up and I just
[19:05.360 --> 19:10.320]  you know, keep it on a shelf in the shower. I mean, it's not even, it's not like I baby it or anything
[19:10.320 --> 19:17.440]  like that. Really high quality stuff. Replacement blades are two bucks each or less. You can get a
[19:17.440 --> 19:26.160]  pack for 15 bucks, 16 pack for just $25. Really, really great stuff. And really nice packaging,
[19:26.160 --> 19:31.680]  great heavy feel to the blade. Everything is just really nice. My dad out of the blue,
[19:31.680 --> 19:37.200]  unprompted by me. I guess he like loads my website. I don't know, once a week or something like that.
[19:37.200 --> 19:43.200]  That's just to see what I'm up to. Not the sort of person who buys stuff like this online.
[19:44.080 --> 19:49.120]  He told me he saw that they were a sponsor of my thing. I swear to God, I didn't tell him,
[19:49.120 --> 19:53.920]  go buy this. He went and did it on his own. He was like, man, this is really nice. So there's a
[19:53.920 --> 20:02.080]  testimony. My dad, Bob Gruber, tells you that Harry's razor blades and shaving cream are really
[20:02.080 --> 20:08.560]  nice. Also, my dad is a notorious cheap skate. It does not listen to the show. I hope he doesn't.
[20:09.520 --> 20:15.440]  But he's pretty tight-fisted. Thought it was a great deal. In fact, I don't think he would have
[20:15.440 --> 20:22.000]  done it if not. So there you go. There's a testimony from my dad. Go check them out. Like I said,
[20:22.000 --> 20:28.480]  go to Harries.com and use the promo code talk show. No, no, the, I don't know what I said at the beginning
[20:28.480 --> 20:34.880]  of the read, but at the end here, just remember talk show, no, the, and you will save five bucks
[20:34.880 --> 20:39.360]  off your first purchase. So that $15 starter kit is just 10 bucks. My thanks to Harries.
[20:40.160 --> 20:47.280]  So how did you end up with a Mac way back in the day if your father was a notorious cheap skate?
[20:47.280 --> 20:53.440]  Oh, that's a great, that's a great question. Well, first part is, and I've told this before,
[20:54.320 --> 21:01.440]  when I was growing up, I did not own a computer. And because my, my parents would not buy me one.
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.040]  And a lot of my friends were having trouble getting their parents to buy them a computer.
[21:05.040 --> 21:09.680]  They were, you know, relatively expensive in the 80s. And the line most of my friends got was,
[21:09.680 --> 21:13.440]  I'm not going to spend all that money. You're not going to use it. And my parents' explanation
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.120]  to me was, we're not going to buy you a computer because if we do, you're never going to leave the house.
[21:18.880 --> 21:24.000]  This is true. And I presented it deeply because I wanted nothing in the world more than a computer.
[21:24.000 --> 21:30.240]  But I have to say that there was, you know, there's some merit to their argument. And they,
[21:30.240 --> 21:36.800]  in some ways, knew me better than perhaps, you know, I know myself. And I, uh, you know, I don't know,
[21:36.800 --> 21:41.360]  I certainly read a lot more books and novels as a teenager than I would have if I owned a computer.
[21:41.360 --> 21:48.240]  That's interesting because like I, I, I tend to kind of like, um, resent my parents for a similar
[21:48.240 --> 21:53.840]  reason. Like they, I didn't really, you know, have access to a computer or was never really
[21:53.840 --> 21:58.400]  pushed in that direction, even though like, you know, kind of wonder like, well, if I had been into
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.640]  that before I went to school, like what, you know, what track would I be on now? Would I be,
[22:02.640 --> 22:07.920]  you know, a, a, a programmer, would I have started my own company or whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[22:07.920 --> 22:14.080]  And, um, obviously in, in the end, it ended up working out pretty well to end up having much more
[22:14.080 --> 22:18.400]  of a kind of literary background, a lot of reading, um, a lot of writing. I did the student paper
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.040]  thing as well. Um, but it's interesting, you kind of put it like, say that word resentment because
[22:23.040 --> 22:27.360]  something I thought about as well. It's like, but it actually, yeah, probably turned out for the
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.520]  best. Yeah. And, and in high school, now I did have a good, pretty good computer science,
[22:31.520 --> 22:39.120]  um, teacher in, in high school. And we had a little lab. Um, mostly Apple, I guess by the time I got
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.800]  to high school, they were mostly Apple two G.S.s. And I think there was one Macintosh. Um,
[22:44.800 --> 22:51.600]  and I, I, I appreciated the Macintosh greatly. I really did. And I enjoyed my time on it. Um,
[22:51.600 --> 22:55.360]  but I chose this been most of my time on the two G.S. because that's where I was most familiar.
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.520]  And that, and for writing, you know, the programming assignments I had, I was most familiar with
[22:59.520 --> 23:06.160]  the, the tools. Um, but then when I went to college in 1991 at Drexel, you had to have access
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.560]  to a Macintosh. Now that didn't mean you had to buy one because you, there was a lab, but I mean,
[23:10.560 --> 23:15.120]  effectively those highly recommended that all incoming freshmen buy one. And the student
[23:15.120 --> 23:19.920]  discounts at the time were tremendous. I think it was like close to 50% off. It might have been like
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.720]  40% off. Nice. So I got, I got a Macintosh when I was a freshman in college. And it was a big
[23:26.720 --> 23:30.720]  reason. And one of the reasons I wanted to go to Drexel is that I knew that if I got a computer
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.840]  when I was a freshman, I certainly wanted it to be a Macintosh. Interesting. Oh, it's funny. I mean,
[23:35.840 --> 23:42.560]  my, my parents, uh, uh, tend to be, uh, more on the, uh, frugal side as well. We should,
[23:42.560 --> 23:48.080]  shall we say, um, and I know it's funny. I, I, I wouldn't not normally think of you as being frugal.
[23:48.080 --> 23:55.200]  Oh, I'm not nor of myself. No, so it just, it's, it will, we, we, uh, I think had a similar reaction to
[23:55.200 --> 24:01.280]  that. No, my sister is though. My sister's too. Oh, my sister is, they way. She's, she's incredible.
[24:02.160 --> 24:07.040]  That's funny. Yeah. Uh, you know, uh, you know, you know, knows where everything is, you know,
[24:07.040 --> 24:12.400]  actually balances the checkbook, et cetera, et cetera knows which store has, you know, certain items
[24:12.400 --> 24:16.240]  that are cheaper than the other store. Whereas I'm so grateful for like, I honestly want to switch
[24:16.240 --> 24:22.000]  all my, all my credit card usage to American Express just because they actually, their Apple
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.560]  Pay implementation actually shows every single charge. Whereas like, I have, I also have like,
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.040]  uh, a couple other cards. They only show the charge on your phone when you charge it with
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.760]  your, using Apple Pay. But American Express, every single charge with the card will show on your
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.240]  phone as an notification. Yes. Yeah. Which I think is great because I don't want to, I don't want
[24:40.240 --> 24:44.240]  to be bothered to like go through my statement every month and make sure they aren't fraudulent charges.
[24:44.240 --> 24:50.160]  So like the fact that it pops up every time is fantastic. Um, it, it hurts me that only
[24:50.160 --> 24:57.440]  American Express does that. Uh, I totally love that. Now is that that? Yes. And I, I know exactly
[24:57.440 --> 25:04.480]  when I was, where I was going with this. So that only works though with, um, with Apple Pay,
[25:04.480 --> 25:10.320]  even though it, like you said, it, you have to have an Apple Pay device. And that means, um, like,
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.520]  for the couple of weeks over the last year where I've switched back to my iPhone 5S for testing,
[25:15.520 --> 25:20.080]  like when I first started testing iOS 9, I didn't want to put it on my six. So I put it on
[25:20.080 --> 25:27.280]  the 5S. And I swear, not the size of the screen. The biggest thing that I missed was getting
[25:27.280 --> 25:32.320]  those, uh, MX notifications. I honestly, there was a day where I, my heart skipped and I thought,
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.360]  wait a minute. Is this busted? I'm not getting, I was like, Oh, it's because it goes through,
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.480]  it doesn't go through the MX app. It goes through Apple Pay. Yeah. Big end, uh, the, what they
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.920]  call the wallet now, but used to be called past book. Well, it's wallet in, is it not in
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.440]  still past book on iOS 8, which by the way, um, I, I never, yeah, it's kind of, I, I, I haven't put
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.400]  it. I haven't installed iOS 9 yet. I never installed anything early. You're smart, but I'm so
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.040]  used to iOS 9 that I'm talking about it. So it's the present version. It's that. Yeah. But I,
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.080]  past book has gotten, um, even, even when I was eight, it's so much better than it used to be.
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.200]  Uh, I've been, I've actually been pretty impressed with it. Dude, is iOS 9 fixed the, uh,
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.720]  removing flights or hotel stays that you've already done, like in the past. No, I don't think so.
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.080]  Ah, that's like the one killer. But like the whole, like, do them automatically.
[26:22.960 --> 26:26.240]  Yeah. Cause they stay in there. You have to, you have to dismiss each individually,
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.640]  which if you're traveling with your family, you have like four, you know, if you have four tickets
[26:30.640 --> 26:33.680]  on your past book, you have to go through and dismiss each one individually, which is really
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.720]  annoying. Yeah. But that said, the way, the way it like uses location and time data to like
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.240]  have the thing there instantly available. I've been very impressed and happy with it. Yeah.
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.720]  I really, really missed it when I went back. Uh, so anyway, that's how I got started with the
[26:48.720 --> 26:54.240]  Mac in 1991, even though I knew it from the 80s, you know, from having used it to spend some time
[26:54.240 --> 27:01.280]  on it in high school. What about you? Uh, I, I started out with, uh, when I went to school,
[27:01.280 --> 27:07.520]  I built my own PC, um, and I actually started a little business on the side putting PCs together
[27:07.520 --> 27:13.120]  for people. I was like, you know, Michael Dell Prodigy or something. Um, but, uh, no, I, so I put
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.600]  together my own PC and upgraded it with different parts and all that. That was that I did that
[27:17.600 --> 27:23.520]  all the way through school. And then, uh, I didn't get a Mac. I got a Mac when I came to Taiwan
[27:23.520 --> 27:29.760]  in 2003. And I think I had a laptop that I bummed off like an ex-girlfriend or something. I think
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.040]  it was broke. And like if I fixed it, can I have it? Um, and I did fix it and then she wanted
[27:35.040 --> 27:38.800]  it back and then I had it and you'll say at some point she could be a Mac ex-girlfriend. I don't
[27:38.800 --> 27:45.120]  think it was about that. Um, but, uh, but yes, around that time, actually, it was when the, uh,
[27:45.120 --> 27:52.480]  the first like flat screen I Mac came out. Uh, not the, not the, not the one with the arm,
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.440]  the one where like the screen was the computer. Um, it was all white. And like, I just thought
[27:57.440 --> 28:04.960]  that was just awesome. Uh, and I used a Mac a bit, um, in, in, in school. But I mean, mainly
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.880]  at the newspaper to do out. Uh, but, uh, but not, not much, but I thought that computer was so cool.
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.120]  And I liked it so much that I ended up buying an iBook. I don't know. I don't know what happened
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.440]  in the transition of buying that. But I mean, I was, I didn't have any money then at all. I
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.320]  think it was probably just a matter of that was that got me in the door. So that was when Tiger
[28:24.320 --> 28:28.400]  around Tiger, I think actually it was Panther. Think Tiger came out like a couple of months after
[28:28.400 --> 28:34.800]  that. And, uh, and yeah, I used a Mac pretty much since then. I was the, you know, head of like
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.200]  the Mac club at Kellogg, like because back, um, you know, helping people like actually
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.200]  Kellogg being a business school, you know, they provided, they had Windows PCs, but these
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.600]  a Mac, you know, it's a little, a little more difficult. And so kind of glued everyone's mind when
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.640]  I left Kellogg to go work at Microsoft because I was kind of known as the, the Mac Apple guy.
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.680]  Um, but, uh, but yeah, Microsoft is good. Windows Windows, I think, um, it's, this is really
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.240]  interesting actually. Windows isn't that, isn't that bad? There's things I like about it better
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.000]  than, than a Mac. Um, some of the window management stuff I think is really, is actually pretty
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.360]  great. And actually I've installed a couple of utilities on, on the Mac to, to replicate
[29:13.360 --> 29:16.480]  some of it. It's called better snap tool. It lets you basically move windows around with the
[29:16.480 --> 29:24.080]  keyboard. Um, it's, it's pretty great. Um, there's a free, free endorsement. Uh, the problem with
[29:24.080 --> 29:29.600]  Windows, and this is kind of counterintuitive, was the app situation, application situation, like
[29:29.600 --> 29:35.760]  the third party apps just all sucked. Uh, obviously the Microsoft apps were good and much better on
[29:35.760 --> 29:42.480]  Windows and they are, they're in there in the Mac, but things like, um, omnifocus or, uh, or like
[29:42.480 --> 29:49.840]  a Twitter app, like just all this like basic stuff. Uh, the Mac was even back in, back then,
[29:49.840 --> 29:55.840]  um, was, I guess, wasn't that long ago, but it was so much better than, then the window situation,
[29:55.840 --> 30:01.200]  where everything at best you could find something third party, but it'd be super ugly. Um, you know,
[30:01.200 --> 30:07.120]  just look like crap and they'd have like the monetization would be weird. Um, that, so actually,
[30:07.120 --> 30:12.000]  the biggest problem I had with using Windows was not Windows. It was not having enough apps,
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.520]  which was, which at the time, I told some people that and they like totally didn't believe me.
[30:15.520 --> 30:20.480]  Oh, no, that's the big advancement was has, but even by then for a consumer sort of,
[30:20.480 --> 30:25.680]  I wasn't as soon as we're getting into our privacy, but, but for personal app usage, uh,
[30:25.680 --> 30:31.520]  the situation was, was pretty dire. Even then, and obviously it's, it's only gotten worse since then.
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.120]  Yeah. Have you ever used, uh, moon?
[30:35.120 --> 30:41.840]  The couple of these details, M-O-O-M. It's, uh, I don't use it. I don't, but if I were to use them,
[30:41.840 --> 30:46.080]  Windows management utility, I, it's probably what I would get. I'll put some links in here.
[30:46.080 --> 30:52.080]  It's just another utility, you know, I, I kind of agree. I don't, I don't use any third
[30:52.080 --> 30:57.120]  party utilities for that anymore, but, uh, I do kind of agree that managing a bunch of open
[30:57.120 --> 31:04.240]  windows on OS 10 with the stock stuff is kind of convoluted. It's kind of hard to, I mean,
[31:04.240 --> 31:08.640]  once you use, use the snapping stuff, it's, it's, it's pretty awesome.
[31:08.640 --> 31:15.200]  It's totally, I haven't used, I haven't used windows since like, I think I used it for like a
[31:15.200 --> 31:24.240]  few weeks on a contracting job in 2000. I don't know. Yeah. No, which is, which is,
[31:24.240 --> 31:28.480]  I might have been like too understandable. No, I mean, well, I mean, once I left, I mean, I went,
[31:28.480 --> 31:32.480]  I went right back to, I went, I went right back to the max. Do they still, they still have like
[31:32.480 --> 31:38.720]  the C drive, right? Like if you buy, if you buy like a brand new like Windows machine, you still
[31:38.720 --> 31:44.400]  have like a C drive, right? They do. I think it might be West exposed. Like, I think, you know,
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.200]  your default view in the Explorer is, is more like, you know, your documents and pictures and
[31:49.200 --> 31:54.480]  stuff like that. Um, but that said, there's the aspects of Windows, the Windows Explorer app,
[31:54.480 --> 32:00.880]  like the actual file management that, um, that are better than the Mac, and, uh, like the way you
[32:00.880 --> 32:04.640]  can have, I mean, maybe it's more power user stuff, you can actually view the tree and like the
[32:04.640 --> 32:10.320]  left and like have the apps on the right, or you can like cut and paste like just, I don't know,
[32:10.320 --> 32:15.440]  I think it's one of those things where, where, uh, if you're always used to the finder, um,
[32:15.440 --> 32:19.200]  you would think it odd, but if you've used it the other way, um, I definitely,
[32:19.200 --> 32:23.200]  that's where we'll never finish in 90 minutes if we get started on the finder, because I'm still
[32:23.200 --> 32:28.720]  not used, I'm still not used to the OS 10 finder. If you're used to the real finder from, uh,
[32:28.720 --> 32:34.800]  the classic Mac OS, then it's all, it's all just ugly and brutal. That's where the action was.
[32:36.320 --> 32:42.160]  Well, I think in general, um, it is Mac OS users and people who like the old finder and spatial
[32:42.160 --> 32:47.840]  finder are what up. It seems to me, tend to be more mouse centric in their usage of the computer,
[32:47.840 --> 32:53.280]  which, was that a fair characterization? Uh, I don't think so. I think for some people that is true,
[32:53.280 --> 32:59.280]  but like I wasn't, and once you learned some of the keyboard shortcuts for the old, uh, finder,
[32:59.280 --> 33:05.840]  it was, it was great. You know, just, uh, command up would go up a, up a, you know, up a level
[33:05.840 --> 33:10.560]  command in the list view, which is what everybody, you know, everybody smart used. You could, um,
[33:10.560 --> 33:16.720]  command left and right to close up, open and close levels of hierarchy, an option command left,
[33:16.720 --> 33:23.760]  right to do the whole, you know, subfolders too. And you type ahead and you could type ahead to
[33:23.760 --> 33:27.600]  select, you still can, a lot of these things still work, but in the old finder, it never
[33:27.600 --> 33:33.280]  screws over and it kept stuff open and you could do stuff like, uh, you still can, but like,
[33:33.280 --> 33:37.360]  just start typing the first few letters of something and it selects the first thing that matches
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.720]  the first few letters without entering any kind of command or anything, you just type it.
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.320]  I don't know, I learned to use the keyboard very, very quickly with the old finder,
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.480]  and it was always very fast and it never felt like I had to wait for anything. But that's,
[33:50.480 --> 33:53.760]  that's, that's, that's another show. I'll save that show from interior Houston.
[33:54.800 --> 34:01.120]  Yeah, as I say, I think my, my perspective is, is distorted by having him talk about the find,
[34:01.120 --> 34:07.440]  the spatial finder, uh, kind of, it's kind of been a, uh, multi decade campaign at this point,
[34:07.440 --> 34:12.720]  I think. Yeah. Well, and we didn't even talk about Chromebooks either, which I actually do really,
[34:12.720 --> 34:22.080]  like, what else? What do you remember? Were you using Windows when the Windows 95 came out this
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.600]  week was the 25th anniversary of Windows 95? No, because I didn't, I didn't have a computer
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.040]  because I was in high school. Right. Um, so when I got a computer or when I built my computer,
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.360]  I think that Windows 98 had either just come out or was about to come out. So, uh, I think,
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.440]  yeah, I think I started with Windows 98. Um, I'd use Windows 95, but no, I wasn't part of the
[34:45.440 --> 34:52.160]  whole, um, line up and do it. I, I, I was following like, I was following the news at by that point.
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.640]  I think I had subscribed to actually, I think I had actually subscribed to some computer magazines
[34:56.640 --> 35:00.880]  or I saw my school. Like we did those all like fundraising drives, you know, where you sell magazines
[35:00.880 --> 35:06.960]  or whatever. Oh, yeah, just in retrospect, just kind of ridiculous. Um, but, uh, so I was, I was,
[35:06.960 --> 35:12.320]  I was subscribed to a few of them. So I definitely followed it, um, even from afar, but no,
[35:12.320 --> 35:19.920]  I was not a part of it. But I, I did enjoy your, your, your YouTube linking, uh, in, in response to it.
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.000]  It was something I thought it was, I still thought it was garbage. It was just better looking
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.200]  garbage than Windows 3.1. It did, well, I mean, it did stop your eyes from bleeding, but it did
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.640]  actually manage memory competently. This is where then you could say for the Mac. Well, you know,
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.440]  but the Mac at least, I don't know, I, I, I've favored user interface design over lower level,
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.760]  you know, Mac, oh, that's of the era definitely had problems. And it was showing its age. Um,
[35:49.760 --> 35:53.680]  but I would say 1995, it wasn't quite even there yet. I would say at that point, there were
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.560]  still advantages to be had by having an operating system that was so low to the ground that,
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.000]  um, you know, that memory wasn't managed like that.
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.240]  Right. Well, I, I think it's, it speaks to how good the user interface was that, I mean,
[36:08.240 --> 36:11.200]  I mean, people talk about Apple dying, but the fact that they didn't die,
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.520]  uh, speaks to how good it was because the reality is on almost every conceivable metric or feature
[36:17.520 --> 36:22.720]  angle, uh, I mean, the Mac was pretty hopelessly behind. It was more expensive that it was
[36:22.720 --> 36:31.680]  performance. Yeah, that was really, I think that it, it, by 96, 97, it was, uh, the fact that
[36:31.680 --> 36:37.840]  the operating system was so crafty under the hood and that memory was all shared, um,
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.200]  was definitely a problem that they knew. And that's why, you know, that it came to a head and
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.160]  that's why they bought next. Um, but the machines of the time were not unusable and they weren't
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.480]  bad. I mean, you know, you could make them bad though. That was the one of the things that
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.120]  people got like. And if you used a stock Mac, this is the thing that people don't remember. If you
[36:57.120 --> 37:03.120]  used a stock Mac and you did not install third party extensions, you would have a state, a pretty
[37:03.120 --> 37:09.280]  stable experience. Um, the thing that really kind of did that in were web browsers. It was even
[37:09.280 --> 37:15.520]  the good ones, uh, at the time had a tendency to really lock up your machine. Uh, but the people
[37:15.520 --> 37:20.800]  who would complain and say like I had a Mac in 1994 and it crashed all the time, they installed
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.360]  all of these system extensions that were all running in the same memory spaces, everything else.
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.560]  It was more or less like people were making their own operating system. Right. Uh, but that's a
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.880]  long story. Yeah, we're, we're, we're doing everything we can to, to not meet our goal like that. Um,
[37:38.240 --> 37:44.960]  you've mentioned before, let's, let's move on. Let's, uh, talk about, uh, the Apple watch in the
[37:44.960 --> 37:51.680]  Taptic engine. I, I think that among the top problems with Apple watch now, low these many months in,
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.800]  uh, I think the Taptic engine is one of the top problems and probably the only hardware problem.
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.280]  Well, no, I, I guess I have a second hardware problem. I have a list of three top Apple watch
[38:01.280 --> 38:04.880]  problems and one of them is the Taptic engine, which I don't think is good enough.
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.480]  Yeah, I, I, what's interesting is I think that's arguably the killer feature of the watch.
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.920]  Yeah. Like that, that was what I missed the most when I was didn't have the watch for three days
[38:15.920 --> 38:23.600]  was back to buzzing in my pocket. Like that, it was really annoying. Um, and, uh, so yeah, I think
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.200]  the, the fact that it's a hardware problem is magnified by the fact that it's so, I think central
[38:29.200 --> 38:35.840]  to the value that the device does, does provide, um, which to me is all about, you know, is the
[38:35.840 --> 38:41.040]  notifications and some of the complications. Um, I have said for a long time and maintained that
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.720]  it was a mistake to launch with these hybrid apps. I could, you know, I, I think they just ruined
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.600]  the user experience. Um, but the Taptic engine is great, um, except for the fact that it,
[38:49.600 --> 38:54.800]  especially the stainless steel models, it seems to be failing for a lot of people. Um,
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.800]  yeah, I think that you think that's true. Do you think it's a lot of them in stainless steel?
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.240]  Cause that was what my, my review, you know, was that had a bad one. That's what, that's what,
[39:04.240 --> 39:09.440]  I mean, based on Twitter responses, I guess what I posted that might as failing. Um, I got quite a
[39:09.440 --> 39:14.960]  few responses and it seemed to be all stainless steel, uh, models that were having problems. And
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.560]  if you remember, I think it was a stainless steel models that were the most delayed too, um,
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.440]  getting out the door. Remember there was the story about like one supplier of Taptic engines,
[39:23.440 --> 39:29.360]  you know, they had bad ones. Um, so I don't know if there seems to have been, there seems to be
[39:29.840 --> 39:33.920]  some sort of common thread here involving the stainless steel models and the Taptic engine and
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.160]  they're being a problem. Uh, I think, I think that there's too many people who've had them fail,
[39:41.040 --> 39:45.840]  maybe not so much that it really hurts the platform, but it's, it's obviously a problem.
[39:46.480 --> 39:53.120]  And I think even in the ones that don't fail, it's not good enough. And like, I could be wrong
[39:53.120 --> 40:00.080]  because it was one afternoon, 11 months ago, almost 11 and a half months ago now when I first got
[40:00.080 --> 40:06.800]  to see the, the prototype late pre-production Apple watches that they had at the event last year.
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.840]  Um, you know, six months before they actually shipped. But what I recall from the ones that I
[40:11.840 --> 40:19.520]  got to put on my wrist there, the Taptic sensation was better. And it wasn't, it was just, it was
[40:19.520 --> 40:25.840]  just more satisfying. It felt more like a tap. Whereas this, and more like something that you
[40:25.840 --> 40:31.360]  couldn't miss, like they, the ones that they had a year ago just seemed to me like they had like
[40:31.360 --> 40:36.640]  hit this sweet spot between, you're not going to miss this, but this isn't going to start all
[40:37.200 --> 40:44.720]  or annoy you. But it was just, it was very humane is the best way that I could put it in the way
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.800]  that if I, if I were standing behind you and you were talking to somebody and I needed to get
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.320]  your attention, I could tap you on the shoulder in an appropriate way, depending on the urgency of
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.400]  the matter. Like is this seriously an emergency? I could, you know, I would tap you more aggressively.
[41:00.400 --> 41:04.320]  If it was just, I do hate to interrupt, but I just want to let you know I have something for you.
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.200]  I would tap you in a certain way on the shoulder and you could interpret that. The watches I
[41:09.200 --> 41:13.760]  remember from September just sort of had that. And I really thought this, this is a huge aspect
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.800]  of the thing. Whereas the watch I wear now, um, yeah, I just, I do miss taps. I don't think I,
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.200]  I'm, in fact, I know that it's not defective. I don't think I, I don't have a watch with the
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.480]  defective taptic engine. It just isn't that great though. And I feel like it needed to be
[41:30.480 --> 41:34.640]  or it needs to be. I feel like it's one of those things that next generation is going to figure
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.600]  something out to do it better. Yeah, I think the, it's interesting. I think my new watch actually,
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.160]  I feel it's not as good as my original watch and I first got it. Again, it's hard to measure because
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.440]  you're going based on memory. Yeah. But the, so the way it failed was it went from from
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.000]  from like a tap to feeling like a vibration. Like so it was like it was getting loose or something.
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.920]  And so, and that had less of a sense of the tapping because it's kind of just this buzzing on your
[41:59.920 --> 42:05.360]  wrist as opposed to being that very distinct tap. And I do think my new one, well, it's, it's tighter
[42:05.360 --> 42:13.360]  than the one that was failing. It still feels more vibrating than like a tap that, that I, that I recall.
[42:13.920 --> 42:17.280]  Again, I recall from my watch first got it or it was from the event also.
[42:17.280 --> 42:26.160]  But yeah, I think that, yeah, it's interesting. I would, I'm curious if the smart ones are different
[42:26.160 --> 42:33.120]  or the sport ones are different. But like I said, it's my, it's my favorite feature. So hopefully
[42:33.120 --> 42:41.040]  they do clean it up. All right, I need to sneak in here and thank our next sponsor. And it is
[42:41.040 --> 42:49.440]  our good friends at hover. Hover is the best way to buy and manage domain names.
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.520]  They're a domain name register. That is like the one of the dirtiest rackets on the internet hover
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.920]  is above the board. These guys do it the right way. These guys are like the apple of domain name
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.920]  registers. And they have a great deal. Remember this, keep this in mind, you get 10% off your first
[43:07.920 --> 43:16.080]  purchase at hover using a special code that I will tell you in one minute. Here's just a couple of
[43:16.080 --> 43:23.760]  points though about hover. You want to secure a great domain for your idea. They have tools. You
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.400]  search like the name of the project or the company or the app or whatever it is you're working on
[43:28.400 --> 43:34.080]  that. You want a new domain for it. They give you the tools to help you search for it and find either
[43:34.080 --> 43:40.400]  the closest and best combination of two words that have a dot com or it help you find an alternative
[43:40.400 --> 43:45.920]  to dot com that's a top level domain. Uh, whichever way you want to go to find a domain.
[43:46.720 --> 43:52.640]  Hover has amazingly good tools. Uh, the help you find it. So you want to get a good domain name
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.120]  hover has you covered there. Uh, you want to take all the hassle and confusion out of the process
[43:57.120 --> 44:03.760]  of registering it. Hover's got you there. Uh, you want easy to use tools like a dashboard for managing
[44:03.760 --> 44:09.920]  your domains. They've got it. They've got it. Great, simple interface. Really, really good.
[44:10.560 --> 44:19.440]  In less than five minutes, you can find a domain, pay for it, sign up and get access to everything
[44:19.440 --> 44:25.600]  you need to control it and get it pointed at your website. Uh, all from hover's dashboard. Really,
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.880]  really great stuff. If you have to register domain, you don't use hover. You are not hooked up
[44:30.880 --> 44:37.520]  right. Um, if you've ever registered a domain anywhere else, you know that companies make it really
[44:37.520 --> 44:43.520]  unpleasant. Uh, not only do they make it hard to buy what you want, but if you ever want to move
[44:43.520 --> 44:49.200]  it somewhere else, boy, that's really where they make it hard. It is exactly the same sort of
[44:49.200 --> 44:52.960]  process that like when you want to call up your cable company and tell them that you want to switch
[44:52.960 --> 44:58.240]  to files or something like that. Uh, and, and they give you the run around and they won't just
[44:58.240 --> 45:03.200]  disconnect your service. Uh, that's exactly what it's like moving domains from some of these
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.360]  domain range of starts. Well, guess what? It doesn't have to be that hard when you go to hover
[45:07.360 --> 45:14.720]  because hover has an amazing service that they call valetransfer. So if you're a hover customer,
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.920]  this is all you do. You give them your credentials, your logging credentials for the old
[45:19.920 --> 45:26.480]  registrar where your old domains are. And for free, absolutely free, you skip the hassle of moving
[45:26.480 --> 45:29.840]  them over yourself. They know all the tricks that these guys pull. They know exactly how to get there
[45:29.840 --> 45:35.680]  and just get it done. And they know how to do it the right way. So your DNS is all pointed the right
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.800]  way and nothing gets, you know, there's no hiccups in the transfer. You just give the customer
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.200]  service reps at hover. You're what they need, the information they need from your old registrar
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.760]  and let them go. And the next thing you know, all of your old domains are all in your hover
[45:49.760 --> 45:56.000]  account. One place with all your domains with the same great interface and service really,
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.080]  really great. When you do buy new domains, they don't do any of this heavy handed stuff,
[46:00.080 --> 46:05.280]  no upsells, no charging you for stuff that shouldn't be there. Are they the cheapest? No,
[46:05.280 --> 46:10.080]  they are not the cheapest, but that's exactly what drove this whole domain name registrar business
[46:10.080 --> 46:15.280]  into the ground is this race to the bottom in pricing. And then that's where they turn to all
[46:15.280 --> 46:22.000]  these upsells and hidden charges. Hover prices are great though. They're really competitive
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.440]  and it includes everything you'd need or want, you know, who is privacy? Everybody should have
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.320]  who is privacy. There's no way that any registrar should be charging for this. Who doesn't want
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.040]  who is privacy on the name and phone number and stuff like that that's associated with the
[46:37.040 --> 46:43.280]  domain name registration? Well, at hover, that's just built in. So they have great customer support,
[46:43.280 --> 46:48.640]  a great interface, great prices, great service, and a great track record. They've been around
[46:48.640 --> 46:54.080]  forever. They have great history. They've even got online tutorials and email support if you don't
[46:54.080 --> 46:57.520]  want to get on the phone and talk to somebody so you can either help yourself or follow their
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.760]  instructions to do whatever it is they want. So here's what you do. When you want to get a new domain
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.000]  name or you want to sign up and switch your old domain names over, go to hover.com,
[47:08.000 --> 47:22.240]  and you'll get 10% off using the code, 3-star podcast. That's T-H-R-E-E-S-T-A-R-P-O-D-C-A-S-T. I love these guys. You can tell they listen to
[47:22.240 --> 47:32.240]  the show with the goofy domain names that they pick or not domain names, but coupon codes.
[47:32.240 --> 47:36.240]  Although I'll bet 3starpodcast.com. I wonder if that's taken. Maybe I should look into it.
[47:36.240 --> 47:44.480]  My thanks to hover and if you need a domain, go check it out. What are your other two problems?
[47:44.480 --> 47:48.960]  Well, actually, I'm going to renumber them and I'm going to say the tactic engine disappointing.
[47:48.960 --> 47:53.840]  I'm going to number that number two. I'm going to say number one is the apps are slow and whereby
[47:53.840 --> 48:01.040]  apps, I mean anything that goes between the phone and the watch. Not just third part. I think the
[48:01.040 --> 48:07.040]  third party stuff is really just embarrassing as the months go on. It's unusable. In some days,
[48:07.040 --> 48:13.840]  it just seems worse. But then even the built-in stuff, it can be can be. Sometimes it's just
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.560]  works. This is the future. Other times, it's like I hit the little weather, the temperature thing
[48:18.560 --> 48:24.160]  on my face to open a weather app and it just spins and spins and spins. And then whether it's too
[48:24.160 --> 48:29.760]  slow. I've got good connection. I'm in home and Wi-Fi. Everything should work just fine.
[48:29.760 --> 48:39.200]  And something somewhere it doesn't work. So I have two comments on that. One, I agree about
[48:39.200 --> 48:44.400]  weather being way too slow and it's frustrating. Two, the other thing that's really irritating is
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.720]  weather doesn't update based on your location. You have to open up the watch app in your phone
[48:48.720 --> 48:55.040]  and change the default city, which to me seems like such a miss. I'm sure it'll be fixed, but it's
[48:55.040 --> 49:00.560]  like, because I'm at travel a lot. So I've developed this relatively regularly. One thing that's
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.080]  great about the Apple Watch is I made a travel face, basically, where as leading from Chicago,
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.160]  I had the Chicago time, I had Tokyo time where we were switching planes and I had Taipei time where
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.480]  we were going. And I also had the chronograph to measure how long we'd flying and the timer to
[49:14.480 --> 49:20.240]  measure how long until we were supposed to land. It was awesome. I usually will fly with the little
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.880]  computer, you know, the flight path in front of me just mainly to see that all the time. But the
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.240]  watch is actually way better to immediately see the time whenever I wanted. But the fact, but so
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.480]  it's it's it's almost a great travel thing. I just wish would update when when you get there.
[49:36.480 --> 49:41.920]  Yeah. Uh, third, I'm going to say is this is one that does not affect me, but it absolutely
[49:41.920 --> 49:49.520]  affects, uh, Amy, my wife, uh, workouts killed the battery. It, yeah, cheat, you know, when she
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.600]  ended, it's one of the, you know, and it's clearly it's heavily advertised as a reason to buy the
[49:53.600 --> 50:02.320]  watch is as a, you know, workout measuring fitness companion. Um, and it just, you know, she goes to
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.760]  the gym and she comes back and she could leave with the 100% charge and comes back and her watch
[50:07.760 --> 50:15.760]  is under 50%. Uh, and then not without enough to get to the end of the day. Um, so I don't know if
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.080]  it's, you know, the exact type of workout she's doing. I don't know if, if other ones, I think the
[50:20.080 --> 50:28.640]  fact that hers is 38 instead of 42 has a factor in that. Um, but that's a real, like one day of, of
[50:28.640 --> 50:33.200]  battery life, it does seem like that's, you know, it seems crazy compared to what watches were like
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.680]  before Apple watch, where you have to charge your damn watch every night. And that can be a problem.
[50:38.240 --> 50:44.640]  Um, but it's, it, when it works, it seems like, yeah, that's, I can get used, I can handle this.
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.960]  This is okay. But if you can't get through the day, it's a deal breaker and doing a workout,
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.440]  uh, and having it not get through the day is, is a real, it's a real problem, I think.
[50:53.440 --> 50:59.680]  Yeah. Well, what, within my last item is sort of a sub item of the apps or slow thing, it might
[50:59.680 --> 51:05.440]  be related to why sometimes they get slow. I think that the, there's a, sometimes there's a finicky
[51:05.440 --> 51:11.200]  connection between a watch and phone. And I feel like it has to be ideally, especially for the
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.560]  prices that are charging it, it really ought to be a hundred percent thing. Like when you connect
[51:16.560 --> 51:25.840]  a keyboard to a Mac through USB, it always works, right? Like if it doesn't, you know that you just,
[51:25.840 --> 51:31.040]  you've got a bad keyboard, right? USB or Bluetooth? USB. And, and, and, and I think it's blue,
[51:31.040 --> 51:35.360]  I think Bluetooth is the reason that, that this watch, you know, but that's, that's not my problem,
[51:35.360 --> 51:38.960]  right? You know, if you've spent a thousand dollars on an Apple watch, the fact that
[51:38.960 --> 51:44.240]  Bluetooth is very difficult to program and as all sorts, you know, whatever, not your problem,
[51:44.240 --> 51:50.400]  it should, it should be work as reliably as USB as plug. Let me guess, you, you, you wear your watch
[51:50.400 --> 51:55.840]  on your left wrist and put your phone in your right pocket. I do. Yeah, that, I'm sure that's why,
[51:55.840 --> 52:01.440]  because the human body is a, it's like a, you know, we're big, big sack of water. You know,
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.960]  what though, my wife has had more problems than me with this, including recently, and she does,
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.320]  she seldom carries her phone in a pocket. It's usually, you know, in her purse or, or something like
[52:12.320 --> 52:18.240]  that. She doesn't usually keep it in a pocket. And it's, and sometimes it's like, it just says,
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.080]  like, they're right next to each other and not often, not often, but like, it was just like a
[52:22.080 --> 52:26.400]  week or two ago, but her phone and her watch and she isn't running any beta software or on
[52:26.400 --> 52:31.760]  anything. She's not running the West betas. Um, but her, her watch was showing the, I can't see the
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.720]  phone icon, you know, the red, the red, the red, right, right, red icon and right next to each other
[52:36.720 --> 52:41.360]  and getting them to see each other again, it's the best thing we could figure out to do was to,
[52:41.360 --> 52:49.920]  uh, reset her watch and then restore it, repair it, restore it from the backup that she had on the
[52:49.920 --> 52:55.120]  phone. Uh, it just seems like something you should never have to do for, for, for, yeah, that's
[52:55.120 --> 53:01.840]  true. And it was weird. It was like, you know, that the magic repairing like where you, uh, point
[53:01.840 --> 53:08.640]  your camera at the, at the cool, uh, animated, um, QR code equivalent, but that they made look
[53:08.640 --> 53:13.120]  not ugly. It, that wasn't working for her. Like for some, and even though I know that that's
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.520]  because I was there with her when she paired it originally, it, and, and it was, you know, in any
[53:17.520 --> 53:21.840]  kind of lighting, like really good midday lighting with lots of sunshine just wasn't working.
[53:23.840 --> 53:29.040]  Yeah, I had the, I couldn't get a pair and when I was, uh, at the Apple store game, I knew when, um,
[53:29.760 --> 53:35.440]  for some reason the genius ended up doing it. And I just think that it's got to, and I think Apple
[53:35.440 --> 53:39.360]  probably, I think that they're aware of this because I think that's how high their aspirations are.
[53:39.360 --> 53:44.560]  But all these little, fiddly little problems are fine for something like the pebble that's
[53:44.560 --> 53:49.360]  aimed at a certain, like the sort of people who pebble advertises too. And when you charge the sort
[53:49.360 --> 53:56.080]  of prices that pebble advert, you know, charges, um, people, you know, this sort of finicky
[53:56.080 --> 54:00.480]  trying to get one piece of technology to talk to another is just what we're used to and that's
[54:00.480 --> 54:08.480]  acceptable. I think that Apple has raised the bar with so many other things in their ecosystem.
[54:08.480 --> 54:16.000]  And with the pricing that they charge and, and the sort of, you know, consumer accessible luxury
[54:16.800 --> 54:19.600]  message that they're putting forth, that's, it's just not acceptable.
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.840]  It's interesting you talk about the luxury angle. I will say the, um, beyond the apps, which again,
[54:25.840 --> 54:32.080]  I think, um, I, I feel like the fact that it shipped these hybrid apps, it was very concerning
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.320]  to me as of what it says about Apple as a whole, like who someone should have said no to that.
[54:37.680 --> 54:44.240]  That, that aside, the, the luxury angle, like the, the biggest issue I have with the watch and
[54:44.240 --> 54:50.480]  I've still worn it every day and I missed it when it was gone. Um, but is I do, I'm not like a
[54:50.480 --> 54:56.000]  some watch connoisseur. I only have one Swiss watch that I got from my wedding for my in-laws. Um,
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.360]  but I, I miss wearing it like I miss going into like I'm going to a nice store and I can be dressed,
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.400]  you know, jeans and a shirt, but you know, if you're wearing like that nice watch, like it, it's,
[55:07.840 --> 55:12.880]  there's a certain sense of feeling that comes from, from that. And I don't get that from the
[55:12.880 --> 55:16.000]  Apple watch. I have this stainless steel with the stainless steel band, you know, it's, you know,
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.360]  relatively high model, but it definitely, um, well, I absolutely think that it looks a lot better than
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.480]  the competing smart watches. Um, and that's fine. I give people may agree or disagree. Um,
[55:28.480 --> 55:34.960]  it still feels pretty geeky and not, not like a luxury item. Even if it's the quality is nice,
[55:34.960 --> 55:42.240]  the workmanship is nice. Um, I miss not having that luxury item. And I don't know, I'm wearing it
[55:42.240 --> 55:47.520]  anyway. Um, parks, I'm a geek in part because like I said, I find the notifications and then not,
[55:47.520 --> 55:53.840]  or I more find the not buzzing in my pocket really nice. But, um, I get what they're going for
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.080]  with that. I, at least for me, I'm not sure that they delivered on that specific point. Yeah.
[55:58.720 --> 56:03.040]  You're just traveling. How do you, how, how do you find traveling with the Apple watch?
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.680]  No, it's great. Like I said, I find it. I think it's great because the multiple watch faces you
[56:09.680 --> 56:15.200]  can set like, like I set up like a custom watch face just for, just for the trip. Um, which was
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.040]  super, super valuable. And because I'm lazy, I don't have zero battery life issues, uh, even flying
[56:21.040 --> 56:27.840]  that 26 hour trip, um, you know, no, no problem as far as battery life goes. It is true. If you
[56:27.840 --> 56:34.880]  don't do a workout, it is, it does get outstanding better. I find that it's half great for traveling
[56:34.880 --> 56:40.720]  and half terrible for traveling. And I'm not sure. Interesting. So like, I, I do think that the
[56:40.720 --> 56:47.120]  directions are pretty great. Um, uh, we just had to, I never use that because, uh, we just had to
[56:47.120 --> 56:53.040]  drive somewhere and we don't have, uh, like a dashboard GPS type thing. I find getting the directions
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.760]  on my wrist while I'm driving the car to be just terrific. Absolutely terrific. And I know I'm,
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.960]  um, I'm thinking about it. Uh, you know, that it's going to tap me when I've got a turn coming up
[57:02.960 --> 57:08.400]  and I can glance and see it. It's really, really like it for that. I like it for little things like
[57:08.400 --> 57:13.600]  as convenient as it is. If you've got like a boarding pass on the watch in a way, like you said with
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.960]  passbook that it just comes up, it like knows you're at the airport. And, uh, it just comes up because
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.800]  how many, especially when you're traveling with kids, uh, a lot of times your arms are full,
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.120]  uh, or you just don't feel like digging through it's, it's pretty cool for stuff like that.
[57:27.120 --> 57:35.120]  Um, oh, I remember on the Amtrak train at one time and it's, it's, I have my boarding pass on the watch
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.080]  and it's just so great because you're on the Amtrak, you already sit down and you wait and they come
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.240]  around and get your tickets. And so instead of having to sit there with your ticket out or fish it
[57:44.240 --> 57:48.480]  out of your pocket or something like that, you just show them your wrist and it's already right there.
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.640]  Really great. The thing I don't like about traveling with the Apple Watch is I really don't like
[57:52.640 --> 58:00.240]  having to set up another charger in a hotel. All right. For sure. Like when we were at Disney
[58:00.240 --> 58:04.640]  World last month, it really was, it, it, it was like, I just gave up on it. I was like, I'm just
[58:04.640 --> 58:08.880]  gonna wear my old watch every, I'm just, just forget it. And I'll put the Apple Watch back on when I
[58:08.880 --> 58:14.240]  go home because it just got to be too much where I just, we just had too many, you know, three
[58:14.240 --> 58:20.720]  phones and three Apple watches was just too much. Yep. Especially if you're, if you're staying in
[58:20.720 --> 58:26.480]  an older hotel room that doesn't have many outlets or. Yeah, exactly. Most hotels, even, you know,
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.200]  well, it is probably the factor of age. But, you know, even at some nicer hotels, it's, it's hard.
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.400]  The one we were at at Disney had the additional problem where it was sort of like a lot of the sockets,
[58:37.360 --> 58:41.680]  they were loose. And so like sometimes you have a charger in there and it wouldn't. But then it's
[58:41.680 --> 58:45.200]  like the three, it's like we just have like a tangle of these white cables, you know, and it's like
[58:45.200 --> 58:49.280]  you just look for a lightning or the thing and you plug it in. And what happened to me the one day is
[58:49.280 --> 58:54.480]  I had, I attached it to the thing and I went to bed and I woke up in the morning and it was dead.
[58:54.480 --> 58:57.920]  And I was like, what the heck, how did that happen? And I started pulling on the thing and it wasn't
[58:57.920 --> 59:04.560]  plugged into anything. It was right. It was just an unplugged in Apple Watch charger. And I was like,
[59:04.560 --> 59:07.200]  you know what, to hell with that. I'm putting this away. And I'll wear it when I go home.
[59:08.480 --> 59:12.560]  Yeah. No, that's definitely, that's definitely a good point. And I think it's kind of a one that
[59:12.560 --> 59:17.920]  one of those ones that yeah, he's will never go away. It does give me, and you think about it.
[59:17.920 --> 59:26.160]  It gives me anxiety. Here's the anxiety I get. The anxiety I get is then when I don't wear it and
[59:26.160 --> 59:29.840]  we're at the steam park and I walk 10 miles. I'm not getting any points for it.
[59:32.720 --> 59:37.840]  That's like the game of vacation is working against you. Yes, absolutely. Yeah.
[59:39.280 --> 59:44.320]  Which is, it's funny. The whole like, I haven't turned any of those notifications off.
[59:44.320 --> 59:51.200]  The, I will tell you the hour notification to stand up is really irritating when you're on a plane.
[59:52.960 --> 59:56.560]  But I still, but I haven't turned it off because out of some misguided notion that this is going
[59:56.560 --> 1:00:03.920]  to, you know, that it would be bad for my health to turn it off, even though I never listen to it.
[1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:12.320]  But I think I've talked about this on the show before. I think that, and again, I say this
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:18.560]  knowing that famous last words is trying to tell some engineer what seems like it should be easy.
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.560]  So I'm not going to say it should be easy, but it seems to me like it should be possible
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:27.360]  for the watch to make a very educated guess that you are on an airplane.
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:33.680]  Because it, it knows when you're at an airport, right? And it's, yeah, that's a good point,
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:40.560]  right? And especially if it knows that it has a past book, or as it's now called in
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:49.760]  I was not in wallet entry for a flight. And it knows what time the flight is. And if it can somehow,
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:56.400]  you know, I don't know, I guess it doesn't have an alt, altimeter. Right. But there ought to be some,
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:00:59.920]  it just seems to me like there ought to be some kind of way that it can figure out that you're
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:03.920]  probably on a plane. And maybe it could even ask you, maybe they could even say, are you going to be
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:09.120]  on a plane? Are you getting on this flight? And then not ask you for that. I have to admit that that
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:13.920]  is, I find that to be terribly annoying too, because especially like in this, you know, second,
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:17.680]  third, fourth hour of a flight when you're really starting to get antsy. And you're like, I just wish
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.160]  this goddamn plane would get to where it's going. And then your watch is like, stand up, move around.
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:26.000]  And it's like, screw you at the one, you know, I'm sorry.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.840]  Well, one, I, I, I, I, I left at your second, third, fourth hour characterization.
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:37.280]  Right. After my, my 13 hour flight yesterday, um, to they, the, the standing indicator,
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:41.920]  like, can't figure out whether you're actually standing or not either. It just goes at, at 10 minutes
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.000]  to the hour, no matter what, which is, which is kind of annoying when you're walking around, it taps you
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.880]  on the wrist. Hey, you gotta stand up. That seems, but that's weird though, sometimes it seems
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:56.480]  to know that you have been standing. And it doesn't show it to you. I don't get it every, every hour
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:02.720]  at the 50 minute mark. I, I guess, who knows, maybe, maybe I don't. But there are sometimes when I
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  am up and I get it. And then it's like, come on. I don't know. Anyway, that's those are my top
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:15.040]  complaints about the Apple Watch. Yeah. No, I, I think that is all fair. I, I, I, for the record
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:21.440]  remain, remain pretty bullish on it. Um, just because I think, you know, the, the arc, the
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.720]  arc of technology. One thing I think is interesting is even when all these apps are coming,
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:28.480]  I'm still a little skeptical about the app situation. I think I'm going to say this on the show
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:33.680]  previously that, you know, kind of what matters on for one area doesn't necessarily matter
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:36.960]  the next one, just because apps matter on the phone. I don't think it's necessarily the case
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:43.520]  they matter for the watch. Um, where I think the watch remains super compelling is, um, you know,
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:49.360]  as a way to interact with the world around you, you know, and like, um, when you can start your
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:54.240]  car with it or unlock doors with it or identify yourself with it, like that's when it's,
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:03:00.160]  it's becomes just a must have and really transformed what you do. Um, in the meantime, like I've
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:06.720]  been very pleased with the notification stuff. Um, and, uh, yeah, I just wish that, I just wish
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:11.520]  that Apple, I, they just sent a ship to the third party, absolutely. But I've said that like four
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:16.560]  times and you haven't taken the bait yet. So I'll let it be. I know. I mean, I, I, I even asked
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:20.800]  Shiller about it in a live show, you know, was it, you know, what was the thinking if you knew
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:27.840]  you were going to have, uh, this fuller SDK just a few months later, even though, yes, announcing it
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:31.920]  in June doesn't mean it's shipping. It's not going to ship presumably until next month in September,
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:39.200]  but even so, if, if the, if that 1.0 watch kit had never existed right now, people would be,
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:43.520]  there'd be some jackass out there writing articles and having written them all summer that Apple
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:49.360]  watch is dead because it doesn't have any third party software. Um, but in the grand scheme of things,
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:54.960]  it would have only gone five months without, right without it. And, and saying something is like,
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:59.040]  like in, in all the reviews would have dinged the Apple watch for it, but like, oh, but of course,
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:04.960]  it will be rectified soon. Like that's a very different than like the watch is slow because like,
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:10.960]  if you don't interact with the apps at all, the watch in my estimation is perfectly acceptable.
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:18.960]  And the, the new Apple that's not quite so secretive, the Apple that had, um, uh, uh, Jeff
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:26.160]  Williams at recodes conference in late May, just say that he could, you know,
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.960]  coyly say that, uh, then this ties in with what you want to talk about with the, that cars
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:36.960]  are the ultimate mobile device. You know, more or less not saying yes, we're working on a car,
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  but really towing, getting right up to the line. Um, right. I think that that Apple,
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:48.880]  today's Apple could have also said at the exact same event, you know, maybe it recode that,
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:54.000]  yes, we were working on an SDK for Apple watch and we'll have, you know, stay tuned for WWDC next month.
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:58.560]  Right. You know, I, I, I, I, that's all agree. It could have come out. And, you know,
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:02.560]  and it even could have come out. Maybe it could have even come out at the, when they had the,
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:06.640]  the event in March, where, you know, the second event where they, you know, seeded the things.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.800]  And even said, you know, and, you know, stay tuned, you know, for WWDC and we'll have,
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:15.520]  you know, this thing. Well, and not just, not just that, but like, this is, that's what Apple does.
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:19.120]  Like, you, I mean, when you're, I'm sure it probably irks you that. One of your,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  one of your best articles is not on daringfireball.com. Oh, I've said this before.
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:29.280]  That absolutely said it. Yeah. The one I made the mistake once. Yeah, the Mac,
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:35.040]  where one like this, how Apple rules, like their version ones are supposed to be under,
[1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:42.480]  under featured, like there's, there's, there's a, there's two, like things that a product should
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:46.160]  be measured on. One is the features, but the other one is, is like how done it is, like how
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:50.960]  completed is. And by complete, I don't mean that it's fully featured. I mean that the features
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:56.640]  that are there work perfectly. And like what Apple's always been good at is, yes, well,
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:00.800]  this is a version one. It's going to be missing a lot of stuff. But whatever is there is going to
[1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:05.360]  work really, really well. Remember the iPhone one, like that, that is arguably the most stable
[1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:10.320]  iPhone of all, right? I mean, that, that thing was, was incredible for what it was, even though
[1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:16.800]  it was missing all kinds of like basic stuff, you know, copy and paste and all that, all this
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:23.200]  very stuff that we, we can all name. But what was there works perfectly better in general,
[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:29.600]  at least an Apple's mindset to ship without a feature at all than to ship with a crappy version of
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:35.120]  the feature? Exactly. Exactly. And that's what so irks me about the watch or concerns me as an
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:42.560]  Apple observer is, to me, the app situation is, is adding it because to check a box. And it's
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:48.880]  adding us poor implementation of it instead of taking the lumps for, you know, in reviews for
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:55.520]  missing something. It added something in it and added it poorly. And that's, and that's a problem.
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:59.920]  Yeah, it's almost like they took somebody at Apple and who knows, maybe everybody was in agreement
[1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:05.520]  and it wasn't a fight about it, but it seems to me like something that maybe was an internal debate
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:11.120]  that there were had to be some people in there who thought the same thing we do. And it makes me
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:18.880]  think that the faction that won out and shipped it took the wrong lesson from the iPhone,
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:22.080]  because famously, and we know this in hindsight, and famously with the original iPhone,
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:30.400]  it didn't ship with a SDK. And I don't think it would have under any circumstances, even if the whole
[1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:35.280]  company was a unanimous that we need to have apps for this thing, just like we do for the Mac.
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:41.040]  In 2007, that still wouldn't happen because the OS was still, they didn't, they weren't ready
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:46.640]  to have public APIs. And that's one thing Apple's always, or at least the next side of Apple,
[1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:51.680]  even the non-next side, I think it's been pretty good about over the years is that they,
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:57.280]  once they publish APIs, they're pretty good about supporting them going forward until they're
[1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:06.720]  deprecated. They don't really change things like that. But famously, there were people on Steve Jobs
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:12.160]  was on that side of it that really thought that they didn't need apps. We can do all the apps
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:16.240]  we need. That it would more or less be like what Apple TV has been up till date. We're not
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:19.920]  that they wouldn't have new apps going forward, but they would be things like the YouTube app
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:25.200]  or they would do them in partnership with somebody else. And that if maybe if there was a Netflix
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:31.840]  app two years later, Apple would write the Netflix app and put it on the phone with API help from
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:37.120]  Netflix and stuff like that. That they could just do it all themselves and have a dozen, you know,
[1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:42.800]  a couple of dozen apps. And that right, you find. And that the other side was no, we should, you know,
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:47.040]  open this up and have an app store. And they looked at how this went and how the app store was
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:52.560]  so, you know, has now become so essential to the success of the iPhone and the iPad.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.960]  And just blindly said, well, therefore, we need to do this for the watch. And we need to have it
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:07.680]  right away. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think which apps I use. I use overcast sometimes.
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:14.800]  But that's about it. I don't. So I don't use a single one. I tried the, I tried the SPG
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:22.960]  wireless entry. But yeah, it's, it was too much hassle. You have to go into the apps and you have
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:26.640]  to click it. Like it would work better if they had like a beacon or something. So it came up
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:30.560]  automatically. That would be awesome. And so that's going to be like my whole vision about like
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:35.520]  having your watch do stuff for you. Um, it would scrape my Apple pay on the watch is great. Um,
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:40.560]  you know, just double click it and do it. It needs to be that easy to have your watch interact
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:45.680]  with the environment. Actually, I have to open up the app screen, find the SPG app, open it.
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:50.560]  They need to click to unlock key. Like it was a multi step process that was totally not worth it.
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:55.680]  On the phone, on the phone, the phone worked great. Um, because maybe just because the phone's
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:02.800]  faster, you stood to open the app. Um, but, uh, but yeah, that other than that, I haven't really touched
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:09.280]  an app at all in a long time. Yeah, I, I, I very seldom go back to that app screen. Um, and just
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.040]  for example, like to, to time this 90 minute episode of the talk show, I wanted to run a timer
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:20.080]  on my watch. And the way I run a timer is I know that third over from the left is the chronograph
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.760]  watch face. And I can, which I love for doing timing because I just can, it don't have to launch
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:31.280]  anything. There's a button right there on the watch face that starts at stopwatch. Yep. No,
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:37.600]  I, I, I put timer in, I have timer and alarm on my watch face. And those are, that's what I use
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:42.000]  by far the most, right? Um, as far as applications go into the day work well because they're native
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.440]  to the watch. Like there's no, there's no lag in using them. They, they work quickly. Um,
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:55.040]  yeah, so it's it will be interesting long term though. I mean, I, I think that, uh, we'll see what
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:01.200]  happens with these version two apps. I'm, um, I'll be interested to see which ones break through
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:05.040]  if, if any. Uh, you know what, I was going to stop. I was going to move to a new topic,
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:09.280]  but the other thing I knew I wanted to say something. I'm so glad you said that is that I'm thinking,
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:17.200]  this is my hunch. And I can't, I don't have concrete examples, but I, my hunch though is that the
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:24.960]  third party key isn't the app like the, the delivery, whether it's technically in code that's in a dot
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:31.440]  app bundle. That doesn't matter, but it's the concept of an app. What faces a user? And in iOS
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:36.240]  parlance, an app is a thing that is an icon on the home screen and you launch it and then it gets
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.880]  the whole screen and then you interact with it until you hit the home button and go back to the
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:46.480]  home screen that is full of apps. And Apple watch has that, right? They have this thing full of
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:52.320]  apps and you launch it and takes over the screen. I think I just think it's the wrong metaphor metaphor.
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:58.720]  Yeah, or package. It's to me. What's interesting, what works best from third parties right now
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:04.320]  are the notifications and the ones that are smart and that you can tap and get a list of buttons
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:09.600]  that give you options to do things like with the do app that I use for certain reminders.
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:14.080]  And I have you, have you tried Outlook yet from Microsoft, the email client? No, they have an
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:18.400]  excellent Apple watch app actually for that exact reason. You get a notification on email,
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:23.120]  you scroll down and there's archive, delete, delay to later, or like whatever, whatever the actions
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:28.320]  you want to do on an email. And yeah, it's all within an educational layer. And so actually that
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.040]  is actually an application that I use, even though I never actually watch the application.
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:37.120]  Right. You're not really using it in the app metaphor. You're using it in this notification
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.200]  metaphor. And you don't, you know, the people who put that together aren't writing a whole app,
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:46.640]  they're just saying, okay, after this notification, here's a list of the actions we want to present.
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.440]  And then you do these actions. And yes, they've written an app that has code that when you say archive
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:55.920]  knows and, you know, it tells the app, okay, take that email message and move it to the archive
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:00.800]  folder, but it's from the user, it doesn't feel like using an app. And the other thing that I
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:08.320]  think might be a big deal with watch, watch OS 2.0 are the third party complications.
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:15.920]  Yes. Being able to put those complications on your watch faces, I think could be a real step up.
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:20.240]  And within a month or two, everybody is going to be like, I can't believe we lived without this
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:24.160]  because I've got my favorite thing, you know, I've got my Yankee scores right here on my watch
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:30.560]  or whatever your favorite thing is. Again, again, that's not really, that's not an app, it's not
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:36.160]  using it as an app, it's using it as this little thing on a face that you can tap and launch the app,
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:43.520]  but that you don't really think of it that way. Yep. I think the key thing here is all of them are,
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:50.960]  and this is where the watch is compelling is the degree to which it integrates with like the
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:55.280]  external world as opposed to being like all included into an app. Like an app on a phone,
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.520]  what makes the phone amazing is the phone anywhere you go, you're connected to the internet,
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:04.640]  and all apps as, you know, you've written about a ton like you have the web, you know,
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:13.760]  HTTP is thriving, even if WWW is, you know, kind of on the decline in mobile. And if you,
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:17.680]  that's what makes the phone remarkable is the way it keeps you connected to the internet everywhere.
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:23.600]  But that, that implies a different user experience where you're inside of an app because you're,
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:27.440]  what you're not actually inside the app, you're inside of Facebook or you're inside of Twitter,
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:32.000]  or you're inside of whatever, you know, the New York Times or whatever, whatever it might be.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.720]  Whereas the watch, if you think about that complication, what it's doing is that complication is
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:43.200]  putting the information into like your external world, or the notification is like interrupting
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:48.240]  what you're doing now. And, and the context that you're operating in is not contained within the
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:53.520]  device. It's like your, your world's context. And I think that hints at why, why I'm still
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:58.560]  both on the watch and why I think, you know, in the long run, this will be not just a luxury,
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:05.120]  but, but more, much more of a must have device is the degree to which it will, that you like
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:10.080]  integrate computing with everything around you, the physical world, not just the virtual internet
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:15.440]  world. Well said, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:23.040]  Warby Parker, Warby Parker believes that prescription eyeglasses simply should not cost 300 bucks or
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:28.640]  more. They bypass the traditional channels. And so higher quality, better looking prescription
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:37.520]  eyeglasses online at a factual fraction of the usual retail prices, starting at just 95 bucks.
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:44.560]  Their designs are vintage inspired with a contemporary twist. Every pair is custom fit with anti-reflective
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:52.320]  anti-glare polycarbonate prescription glasses lenses. Every pair comes with a very nice hard case
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:58.640]  and a cleaning cloth so you don't need to buy any overpriced accessories. And they now offer
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:06.160]  for our older, our older friends, progressive lenses, aka bifocals, but you know, they don't call
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:10.000]  them anymore because they, I don't know, they do some kind of fancy stuff with a computer to make
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:15.600]  the two lenses sort of blend together. Anyway, those are usually very expensive. Warby's
[1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:21.440]  progressive lenses started just $295, including the frames. They have a distance prescription at
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:27.760]  the top and a transition to a reading lens near the bottom. And their progressive are, they
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.720]  call them digital free form lenses. That's the most advanced progressive technology, higher
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:39.440]  precision and a larger field of vision than traditional progressive lenses. Buying glasses online
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:44.080]  sounds like it would be risky, right? Because it's like you go to a glasses store and you know,
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:48.400]  you start trying these things on. And right there in the store while you're trying mine, you're
[1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:52.880]  going through a whole bunch of pairs and you're like this, that, this, that looking in the mirror.
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:58.560]  Warby has you covered, makes it super easy. You go to their website and you pick out the glasses,
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.400]  you're like up to five pairs. And they just send them to your house free of charge. And you
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:11.840]  borrow five at a time, take them to your house, try them on at home, at your own pace, see which ones
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:18.240]  you like. And then when you go to buy them, you can use your computer's webcam. And they have
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.640]  tools that help you do the things that the things that you know, it matters like how far apart
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:28.960]  your pupils are, you know, whether it's, you know, 17 millimeters or centimeters or 16 or something like
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:33.040]  that. They have a simple little 17 centimeters, you're going to have a problem. Well, whatever,
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:38.160]  I'm not good at centimeters. Um, you know, how far apart are your eyes? I don't know, two,
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:43.600]  three inches, whatever, uh, 17 centimeters in inches. It would be seven inches. Yeah, well, I guess
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:47.600]  if you're very, very large person, yeah, or maybe if you're like walleye or something.
[1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:52.240]  Anyway, what you do, you just hold up a credit card, which is a standard size. And then the
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:56.800]  camera knows how big the credit card is. And then it measures your distance. Uh, I've done it. I
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:03.920]  have these wirby partners. I, I, they're the best glasses that I own. And, um, it did their,
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:09.360]  you know, the distance thing worked great. It really feels like a real pair of glasses. Um,
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:15.840]  so you can try them at home, see which ones you like. Uh, no obligation to buy. If you
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:20.000]  get five glasses at home and you don't like any of them, send them all back and there's,
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:25.040]  there's nothing. You're, you're out, nothing except, uh, putting them back in the box with the
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:29.120]  prepaid label and dropping it off or doing everything you have to do to get it back in the UPS's
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:36.720]  hands. That's it. Um, they also have sunglasses, uh, prescription and non prescription, uh,
[1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:43.520]  polarized sunglasses. Um, anyway, I'll, the last thing they want me to mention, and it is a great
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:48.080]  thing is that they believe in giving back to the world. And for every pair of glasses,
[1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:54.800]  wirby Parker sells, they give another pair to someone in need through a whole bunch of
[1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:58.560]  vision charities. Uh, you can check it out on our website and they list who they are, but they go
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:02.800]  all around the world. And it truly is a remarkable thing. Cause like, just imagine what that would
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:08.160]  be like if you couldn't even see clearly, uh, and didn't have the money or the resources to get,
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:13.440]  uh, just a simple little $95 pair of eyeglasses that could fix the problem. Well,
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:18.000]  wirby Parker is, is working on that. So that's really great. They've been doing that for years.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:26.560]  So here's what you do. Go to warbyparker.com slash, um, the talk show, I believe. I'll correct that
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:33.920]  in a second, if I'm wrong, but, um, go there and check it out. And, um, uh, my thanks to wirby
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:39.760]  Parker, great classes. I will say, uh, I, I, I've quicked the conversion of the send
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:44.320]  the meters to inches, um, using spotlight, which I used to be speaking of third party resources.
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:50.000]  I used to be a huge, uh, um, launch bar user. Yeah, I can't get used to it. And their life
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.880]  without launch bar. Well, I, I was for a very long time, um, but basically what happened was
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:20:00.560]  there, uh, their copy paste functionality was, we had this weird bug for like a very long time
[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:06.320]  never complaining about it. And so I gave up and ended up using another, another clipboard manager,
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:10.800]  um, which by the way, I will say like, that's the number one reason I don't use the, with the
[1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:16.400]  Chromebook, which I always talk about loving. Uh, more than I do is because I can't live without a
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:23.120]  clipboard manager. Um, it's always something, right? Uh, but, uh, so I tried out like, well, let me try
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:29.040]  to do using this and using spotlight. Um, I did have to add, I cheated because I'm not using pure
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:34.320]  spotlight. I added something called flashlight. So flashlight, uh, adds a bunch of additional functionality
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:39.440]  just to spotlight, including the ability to like, like I can search directly in different domains
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:43.760]  or there's a, there's all kinds of stuff it adds on to it to make it much more launch bar like
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:49.440]  with like a lot of custom actions that you can do. But, uh, I, I, I've been with it for like
[1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:53.440]  six months now. I'm pretty, I'm pretty happy with it. I never heard of flashlight. I will put this
[1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:58.320]  in the, uh, in the show notes. Yeah, I couldn't use straight spotlight. I have to have the stuff that
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.360]  flashlight adds. Um, I'm gonna put it in the show notes. Here I am. That's me pasting it into the
[1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:09.520]  show notes. So that gives it, I give it a 50% chance to making it into the actual show notes.
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:14.160]  How are we doing on time? We're at, we're, we're, we're, we're running pretty long. We're at an hour
[1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:18.560]  and 16 minutes. We have 14 minutes, technically to do the rest of the show. I don't know, we might
[1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:23.440]  run slightly long, but that's not too long, but not more than a minute longer. Oh, I really,
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:27.680]  I really generally do want to get your thing on this Apple car thing. So here, here's my, here's my
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:33.680]  conundrum in a nutshell with the Apple car thing is the issue I have with, obviously there's lots
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:39.760]  of smoke and think there'd be fire. There's two possible outcomes here. One is that Apple produces
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:44.720]  like a normal car, which I think they could do a good job in electric car and be very competitive,
[1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  except that I have questions about the long-term trajectory of the car market, particularly with
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:52.960]  the rise of things like Uber and, and car sharing and all that sort of thing. I think in the long run,
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:22:00.480]  um, car ownership is likely to decline, um, which seems odd to launch into that. The other
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:05.440]  options do the self-driving car, which I think is, you know, is certainly the long trajectory,
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:11.360]  but then I question Apple's competence in, in pulling off a self-driving car, um, which seems
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:16.960]  to fit much more to, you know, Google's strengths, um, as particularly though with the data and
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:22.640]  intensive approach they're taking to it, I, I just, I mean clearly there's lots of, there's lots of
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:27.520]  smoke here, but it just, um, I don't know, it doesn't seem to quite add up for me. I mean,
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.560]  maybe this comes from my, like I said, you said use Apple mesh for the watch. I don't because it's
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:39.200]  unusable here in Taiwan. Um, I tried it when I first got the watch and it made, it told me to make
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:45.520]  two illegal turns, both of which one got me killed. Um, so I don't know. So I, I'm, I'm, I'm
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:49.600]  just baffled about the whole thing to be, to be honest. Well, not baffled. I'm just, I can't
[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:56.000]  figure out what I think. Just a rehash as of this recording, uh, we are recording, um, when today,
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:02.720]  August 26th show, probably about tomorrow, but, uh, uh, some of the smoke that's appeared in the
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:08.400]  last over the summer is a whole bunch of high rings at Apple that we people have spotted from,
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:16.400]  like LinkedIn profiles changing and, and et cetera of car people of various sorts. Um, it doesn't
[1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:19.600]  even matter going through them one by one. It's a whole bunch of people with experience in the car
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:26.320]  industry or from Tesla from BMW or what have you. Uh, and it doesn't make any sense for Apple to have
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:32.560]  hired all of them if they're not making a car, uh, or something car related. Uh, and then there was
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:39.600]  the thing who got that scoop where Apple is trying to build the Guardian did the test, yeah, at a test
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:46.320]  track that, and, and I took issue with it and just my point was that the Guardian deadline was, uh,
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:52.160]  something about Apple, you know, shows that Apple is working on an autonomous car. And I didn't see
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:57.600]  that as being evident that it was an autonomous car. It could have been a normal car. Yeah, and
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.840]  what people said to me in response was that it's not just a test track. It's like a little fake
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:08.400]  town, um, this area, it's a gold naval base somewhere in San Francisco or something. And that it
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:13.040]  doesn't make sense for anything other than a naval or autonomous car, because if you want to test
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:17.040]  a regular car, you can test that anywhere. I'm not sure that holds though, because I think Apple
[1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:22.480]  definitely wants testing area nearby. So the fact that they could, you know, get a test track and
[1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:28.000]  Detroit or something like that, that doesn't help them. Uh, and who knows, maybe there are some
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:32.320]  minor autonomous features, you know, collision detection or something like that that they're working
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:36.400]  on, but that it's not really a self-driving car. Because the thing to me, and I, maybe I'm wrong,
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:41.680]  I hope I'm wrong. I, I think self-driving cars sound great. I, I really hope that they come sooner
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:48.160]  than later. I hope, you know, it sounds fantastic. Um, I, it just seems to me that my gut feeling
[1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:54.160]  is that it's way off. That's, it's pretty, that's really far off in the future. Not really, I don't
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:59.360]  know. It sounds like we're in the same boat here, um, which is interesting because some people
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.200]  I mean, like, it seems like we're far enough out that Apple wouldn't need to wait for that
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:08.080]  if that, if they want to get into the car business and that they can do this iterative and get in
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.920]  and start figuring out, you know, how are they going to sell them around the country and the world?
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:18.560]  Right. Right. You know, and get in and start doing that before they have the self-driving aspect
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:25.920]  down, uh, and then, you know, and then come out with self driving car at the same time that they
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.720]  would have anyway. It like, it's, you know, and on a longer scale, like what I was saying before about
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:35.680]  the app store for the iPhone that it didn't make sense, even if they had been 100% internally
[1:25:35.680 --> 1:25:40.480]  committed, which they weren't, but even if they had been internally committed to, we should do an
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:46.960]  app store for the iPhone. It didn't make sense for them to wait until 2008 to ship the first one,
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.520]  the one that they shipped in 2007 was totally worth shipping when they did. I think it would be
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:58.560]  totally worth Apple if they could shipping a car in 2020 that is sort of traditional in terms of
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:05.200]  how you drive it and doing a self driving car in 2025. That's that I like that. That makes sense.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.360]  And because like, they're still clearly a significant market for for a car now and for all the
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:17.440]  various reasons, like I mean, beyond the, um, you know, Johnny, I love cars, but also just from
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:23.200]  a pure finance perspective, there's a lot to like about Apple doing a car. Um, and yes, and the
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:28.160]  other thing is if they started out with normal cars, they could outfit those cars with all the
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:37.280]  sensors and stuff to start gathering data, um, that would go into a self driving car. Like what's,
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:42.560]  you know, Google can put a bunch of mapping cars in the road, Apple can could theoretically get a
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:48.160]  bunch of like actual cars in the road, gathering data, improving, you know, their, their data set and
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:52.320]  their algorithm, there's a lot of sort of stuff. Uh, that's, uh, they're having it thinking of it as
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:57.760]  being a, a multi stage process. That's one of the more satisfactory answers I figured, they think
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:02.240]  you this has been productive. I appreciate it. I, I, I, I just wrote them down, but I've had them
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:05.680]  in my head and it's dangerous for me to walk around with things like this in my head that aren't
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:09.520]  written down. So now I've got them written down, but I've got three reasons why they make sense for
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:17.280]  Apple to be working on a car. Um, uh, one is financial cars are expensive and they are a big business.
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:22.160]  There are a lot, you know, millions of cars sold in the world and they sell for tens of thousands
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:31.200]  of dollars. So that's a good, in general, that's a good business to be in. Um, to the market is
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:37.520]  ripe for technical disruption and it is. It's already happening with the move to, you know,
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:43.440]  electric drive trains and stuff like that. Uh, power power sources and the, the way that drive
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:49.440]  trains are changing based on that. Um, and self driving is another air, you know, it's, it's,
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:53.840]  I guess it's unrelated. You know, I guess you could have a self driving car that runs on gasoline and
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.160]  you can certainly have an electric car that isn't self driving, but that's two big areas though
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:04.000]  where there's enormous technical disruption. Um, and so it's time, you know, the market is
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.960]  obviously going to change. I think the car market is going to look a lot different in 20 years than
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:14.400]  it does now. And that's not necessarily true now from where it was 20 years ago, right? The top
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:19.200]  top car makers today are pretty much the same ones. Top car makers 20 years ago and the cars are
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:23.920]  technically very, very similar. Um, I don't think that's going to be true 20 years from now.
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:31.600]  So it's a good time to get in. Um, and it, it, like it's just to a subpoint on that when
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:39.920]  computers come into a new market and there's the old stand buys and then there's the computer
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:46.960]  companies. Uh, it's the computer companies that seem to do better building the new, the, the old
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:53.520]  thing, then the old thing makers are at computerizing their things. Right. So like the rim, the rim
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:29:01.360]  example, yeah, it's a rim is a perfect example where rim built these phones and pagers and all of
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:06.320]  a sudden it got to a point where these things could be real computers. And I know that sort of an
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:10.800]  arbitrary distinction saying that, you know, today smartphones are real computers and rim
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:18.720]  models from 10 years ago were not, but I, I stand by it. And that companies like Apple were better
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:24.240]  at making phones, even if like the, you know, famously, they don't like the first phone, you know,
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:29.520]  drop calls a lot. And whether that was AT&T's fault or Apple's fault or whatever, Apple got better
[1:29:29.520 --> 1:29:35.040]  at making phone antennas a lot quicker than rim got it building computers. You know, and I think
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:39.120]  that the same thing could happen with cars. If computing matters, I think Apple's going to be able
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:46.880]  to make a car easier than even BMW or Mercedes companies with good, you know, well-run companies
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:50.800]  with good histories are going to be at making computers. Well, there's this, oh, sorry, go ahead.
[1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:57.520]  Well, my third factor is very simple. The car market has always been for 100 years and counting
[1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:03.440]  a market where design matters. Yep. And that's plays into Apple strength.
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:07.040]  Well, not just that. So that I would add a couple things. When the rumors first came out,
[1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:11.520]  I wrote a very similar article like saying there's actually a lot of things here that make sense.
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:19.760]  And I would, you nailed most of them. I would just add from the design matters perspective.
[1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:29.120]  The making electric cars got in a lot simpler. So, or electric cars are relative to a mechanical
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:33.200]  car is a much simpler thing to build. Like, electric motors are much more like you're not,
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:40.800]  an actual car like is a controlled explosion happening constantly. And so the level of refinement
[1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:45.680]  needed to build like a quality engine and all that sort of things is much different and a much
[1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:51.600]  different skill set than a electric car where so it's much easier to enter the market now than it was.
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:58.240]  And what happens is, you know, I think you were driving at this because that having engine
[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:04.640]  expertise and having knowing how to build a great combustion engine is no longer a price of entry,
[1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:12.720]  that changes what matters the priority. So it used to be that you first off making a good engine
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:19.680]  was table stakes and then you could get to the quote unquote user interface. But now that the
[1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:27.040]  engine is no longer a price of entry, what matters most has changes because there's new table
[1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:34.000]  stakes. Just look at what BMW's name stands for, right? The very motor works. Exactly. Exactly.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:39.600]  And so this gets to my second point, which is that the reason why I think you said that the
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:43.600]  the list of top makers will be very different in 20 years than is today is it's
[1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:48.560]  any time because of this fundamental change from from mechanical tool electric. And again,
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:51.760]  this is not even touching on the self driving stuff, which I think you perfectly articulated is
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:57.680]  going to be a separate event because you have this shift from mechanical to electric.
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:03.680]  It's everyone's starting from the same spot kind of objectively. And this was like going to
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.840]  mobile, right? It wasn't everyone's like, Oh, Microsoft missed mobile. Microsoft didn't miss
[1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:12.960]  mobile. They were on mobile earlier than anyone else. The issue was that what mattered in mobile,
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:19.200]  it was a brand new paradigm being good at the desktop. Didn't advantage on mobile. In fact,
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:26.640]  if anything, it made Microsoft worse off because the temptation to to take the desktop paradigm
[1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:30.880]  and stick it on to mobile was overwhelming. And that's exactly what they did, right? When
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:35.200]  those mobile actually had a start by start button that you pressed with the stylist and it popped
[1:32:35.200 --> 1:32:43.040]  up a menu, like a Windows 95 menu. And I think it's probably going to be the same challenge
[1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:50.080]  with with cars. The mechanical, it's not just that the mechanical guys no longer have an advantage
[1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:56.240]  over the electric guys. It's that they're actually at a disadvantage because they will be much less
[1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:04.320]  capable of truly starting from with a fresh sheet and rethinking what a car means. And if electric,
[1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:08.080]  if you start with the idea that it's going to be electric car and all that other stuff that has to
[1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:13.360]  do in mechanical, the gym goes away, then yeah, you have something like Tesla having like a 17 inch
[1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:19.200]  screen in their cart, right? Because that's actually much more important. And I think that's a
[1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:24.000]  reason why in these big transitions, the big players actually end up completely transforming.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:30.240]  Yeah, and look at my reasons. Number one, they're expensive and it's people spend a lot of money
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:36.160]  on them. Two, it's a market ripe for tech disruption. Three, it's a market where design is historically
[1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:42.160]  mattered. Those are the same three things going on with the watch. People spend a lot of money
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:49.280]  on the watch. It's a ripe for technical disruption. And by what I mean by that is that we've
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:54.880]  reached a point where you can build a Unix computer that runs in a watch size device,
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:01.360]  which is a net network, which is a point of disruption. So that's, you know, whether or not,
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.200]  you know, who knows, maybe the digital watches are going to die again. Maybe it'll be a fad like
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:10.000]  the 80s, but there certainly seems like it's a time for disruption because it wasn't possible
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:15.120]  before and it is possible now. And three, it's a market where design matters. Well, that's
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:19.280]  absolutely, I mean, I don't know that that's more true for any market other than watches.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.040]  Maybe, you know, the only other thing you compare to would be women's fashion,
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:32.400]  you know, in terms of the importance of design and the incredible variety of it that's out there.
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:36.880]  So the exact same reasons I think that Apple got into watch market exactly the reasons they get
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:40.880]  in the car market. And it's exactly the same reasons they got into the cell phone market.
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.840]  They're expensive. It's a market that's ripe for technical disruption in an area where Apple's
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:52.720]  expert and design matters. Well, I would add, I guess the thing I would phrase about the
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:57.280]  technical disruption, I would refine it further to say, it's not just that there's techless
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.960]  eruption. It's that what used to be a mechanical object is becoming a computer and Apple is a
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:09.200]  computer company. And a car today is a mechanical object with all these computers stacked on top
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:14.560]  of it. Like some models have like nearly a hundred microprocessors. But if you think like the reason
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:19.040]  why there's a hundred different ones that are all distinct and they all, you know, in why it's hard
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:24.560]  for a typical mechanical and service a modern car is because they're all kind of tacked on, right?
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:32.080]  Yeah. But if you start with the assumption that an electric car is a computer with wheels attached,
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:38.800]  then it becomes very obvious that a computer company is going to is going to have an
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:45.360]  advantage in the long run. And that's the same as the phone. It was no longer a phone with,
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:50.640]  you know, calendar functionality or email functionality. It became a computer that could also make
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:58.160]  calls. And that flipping of the paradigm is what makes it an attractive market for Apple, for Google,
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.600]  for the, you know, the big software companies. Yeah. And I think you're exactly right. And
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:10.160]  your example that the entrenched market leaders are the ones who have the hardest trouble zooming
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:16.000]  out far enough to go back and just start over. The phone's best example that I can think of. And I
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.520]  know I've harped on this for years is the fact that the iPhone doesn't have a green make a call
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:26.480]  button and a red hang up button. Yep. And I'm sure, in fact, I know I've mentioned it before. And I
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:30.240]  think people have pointed, there's, you know, there are certain phones that came up before that didn't
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:36.000]  have those things. But very few, it is, you know, they're, they're way off in a corner of phone
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.200]  history. Every single mainstream cell phone that was ever made before the iPhone had in fact, the
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:45.600]  color is almost never changed. They had a green button to make a call and a red button to hang up the
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:52.400]  call. So getting rid of those buttons was just like a huge and, and really just relegating the phone
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:56.880]  to an app status, you know, and then I've said this before too. I think in hindsight, I think if there's
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:02.800]  a mistake that Apple's made in the, you know, what's it been eight years since the phone, I, I feel
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:11.600]  I really wish that they would further reduce the magical nature of the, of the phone app. I don't
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:16.800]  want, I would like to reduce an incoming phone call to the same sort of notification I get from
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.080]  anything else. Oh, totally. Why should it take over my screen and, and do, yeah, like sure, let
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:26.800]  it out. Let me set a ring tone. So if I have the volume on, it'll play the ring tone, but I don't
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:31.280]  want it to take over the whole screen. And if I have it on silent, I just want it to drop down a
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.360]  little window shade at the top. I really, the phone calls are just not that important to me. So
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:41.760]  if anything, I feel like Apple has fallen behind and reducing the fact that the phone should be just
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:46.480]  just an app. Yep. It still has a few magical features, you know, like when you get a phone call
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:50.720]  the way it takes over no matter what you're doing. But for the most part, they, and I don't, I don't
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:56.080]  think any of the existing phone makers would have made that jump. No, I, that, that's exactly right.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:00.240]  They could have, but they didn't. Right. Well, that's always the thing. And this is the, this is
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:05.600]  why startups succeed and why incumbents fail. Like the incumbent usually has more experience, they have
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:13.680]  more capital, they have more money to invest. But all that pales in comparison to one year incentives
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:20.640]  and two, you're kind of preconceived notions. Like if you, like when Microsoft came up, they, if you
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:25.920]  want to characterize the OS or computer as like a square, like make it a physical object, like
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:30.720]  they were motivated to make the most perfect square in the world that fit this new paradigm of a
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:37.600]  PC. The problem is when the phone came along, what you needed was a triangle. And Microsoft was
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:41.280]  so invested in everything about their corporation and everything about their organization and their
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:47.360]  incentives were, were perfectly aligned to make the best squares in the world, which meant they
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:53.520]  viewed the triangle as a attempt to, like they, they tried to push the square into it. Right.
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:58.240]  Whereas if you started from scratch with the, with the triangle, it's not just that you, you
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:04.240]  are starting from the same place as Microsoft. So you have an equal chance to them. You actually
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:08.480]  have a better chance because it's, you know what you're targeting and you don't have all that
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.360]  baggage and cruft. Um, you know, famously disruption, it's not just that Microsoft, there's a
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:17.760]  financial aspect where they want to keep the old financial stream, but it goes deeper than just
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:24.000]  find it finances. It's like the very way people think, like it is conditioned for a certain view
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:29.680]  of the world. And it's incredibly difficult to break out of that, particularly in a large
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:34.560]  organization where this stuff is like is embedded deep in the culture and the way people think
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.240]  about things. We just, we've gone over 90 minutes, but I, I'm just going to call time out here,
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:46.160]  and I'm just going to say that the remainder of the show doesn't count. I want to take a moment
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:50.320]  here during this time out. And I want to thank our third sponsor and it's our good friends at
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:55.760]  Casper, Casper sells an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price.
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:01.440]  Just the right sink, just the right bounce. They take two common technologies from modern
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:08.720]  mattresses, latex foam and memory foam. And they put them together for just the right version.
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:13.360]  You don't have to sit there and choose between four different mattress types. They, they've figured
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:18.640]  out one that's great. And you just pick the size you want. And that's it. That's all you have to do.
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:23.680]  It is so easy. That to me is like the best thing about Casper is that you don't have to sit there
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:29.600]  and think whether I want this one as more memory or one that's has more bounce or whatever.
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:33.600]  No, they just figured it out. They figured out the right, the right mix. And that's it.
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:40.240]  Seems crazy. Seems even crazier than buying eyeglasses online, but they've got the same type thing.
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:46.640]  Look, you just call up. They send it to you. It's a risk free trial. I think it's 100 days.
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.200]  Something like that. Yeah, here it is. 100 days. You got 100 days with the thing.
[1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:57.120]  Buy a Casper mattress. 100 days if you don't like it, ship it back to them.
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:03.920]  Their mattresses are made in America. And their prices are just blow away good. Really, just
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:09.040]  remarkable. If you don't believe me, go to a mattress store and try to find high quality mattresses
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:16.560]  at these prices. 500 bucks for a twin, 950 for a king and all the sizes in between, or, you know,
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:24.480]  in between 500 and 950. It's an outstanding price point for a really good mattress.
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:29.760]  It just, it still blows me away when I think about when I got, they sent me one of these things
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:34.720]  last year. It comes in a little box. You cannot believe that there is a full-size mattress
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:40.560]  in this little box. And it's got instructions. Kind of weighs as much as you'd think a mattress
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:45.120]  would weigh, but it is an incredibly small box, because it doesn't have springs and stuff like that.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:50.000]  That stuff is like ancient technology. It's all just foam, and they just, I don't know, somehow
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:54.720]  vacuum pack it into this thing. So you put it in a room where you want the mattress. That's the
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:59.840]  most important thing. Listen to the box, and then you open the box the right way, and it's just,
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:04.720]  it makes cool noise that I won't try to replicate as it just sucks in the air, and then all of
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:11.600]  a sudden, boom, you've got a mattress in your room. It feels like you're living in back to the future,
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:16.800]  or something like the future of back to the future, where, you know, you put a little pizza in the
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:22.480]  thing, and 10 seconds later, you've got a full pizza, except instead of a pizza to mattress,
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.440]  does that make sense? I hope so. Could not be an easier way. I've got a whole bunch of tweets.
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.280]  I've been retweeting them. People are like buying these things, and they all say the same thing
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:35.440]  when they tweet. They're like, I thought it was crazy to buy a mattress online, but I had been
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:40.960]  listening to this thing on the talk show, and I did it, and it is. It's a great mattress.
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:45.360]  I think, and I don't have this here in front of me, this might not still be true, but I believe
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.640]  it was true for a while. I said, if you live in Manhattan, you can get a Casper mattress delivered
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:43:00.480]  same day by some cat on a bicycle, which is crazy, absolutely crazy. So just dial it up at,
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:07.120]  which is their website. I think it's Casper.com, but I do know the code. The code is the talk show,

[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:23.360]  the talk show, and you'll save 50 bucks off. My thanks to them. Let's wrap it up. We got to wrap
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:34.000]  this thing up, because timeouts can only last so long. One last thing that I wanted to talk about,
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.480]  and that was this Amazon thing in New York, New York Times. Do you see this?
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:43.280]  I did. I wrote a lot of a lot. I wrote two daily updates in an article.
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:51.360]  Yeah, so first off, I haven't written about it at all. So I'll let you talk.
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:56.720]  Well, first off, there is an article just today we're going on Twitter about someone who used to
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:04.080]  work for Amazon, who left a maternity leave and got cancer at the same time, and I saw that.
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:11.680]  Both got cut off from her insurance, and which was claimed to be a mistake, and then when
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:15.520]  came back, like, all our direct parts reports were gone, and she was basically marginalized and
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:24.720]  resigned a few months later. So I think just to be clear, that sort of behavior in all the
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:31.200]  kind of anecdotal allegations of treating someone with miscarriage poorly, the cancer patient,
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:36.560]  like that's abhorable and deserves to be condemned as strong as possible terms.
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:42.960]  And I will say, I believe that it happened, because if you're in an environment where they're
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:49.600]  pushing so hard, if you're running right up to the line, like you're going to go over it sometimes.
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:57.120]  So I actually tend to believe that there is some truth, that stuff. So that aside just to be
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:02.800]  super clear, that should be tolerated. And I hope that this will produce changes.
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:11.440]  Secondly, though, the issue I had with the New York Times article specifically was, and this
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:16.560]  sounds really like silly, but was the tone of it? Like there's all these kind of throwaway lines,
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:21.440]  like, oh, you know, basically kind of mocking the person who was so excited, looking at frozen
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:26.880]  dull to someone, or like, oh, they're working so hard so you can get scotch tape. Like it was kind of the
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:34.240]  the snark and the disdain that in the kind of tension that I felt it had, that really rubbed me
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:41.280]  the wrong way. And the reason it did was, the fact of the matter is I know a lot of the
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:46.160]  working Amazon, I lived in Seattle, I personally chose not to work at Amazon, because I had a
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:51.440]  family, and it's not great for that by all accounts, everyone knows that. But on the flip side of
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:56.000]  where I had, I've been single, I think I would have loved the opportunity. Like I love the idea of
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:01.440]  an environment where you're like, you should challenge something. If you think something's wrong,
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:04.560]  you stand up. You somebody who's a representation, you tell them it's a bad presentation. That
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.440]  happened to me at Apple. I got like totally torn apart one time at Apple. And like, I think I did
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:14.720]  cry at my desk. And you know what, I came back and it led to me doing some of the best work I've
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:21.920]  done in my career. And not only that, it instilled in me the understanding that you can dig deeper
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:26.720]  and go down a deeper level and get something better. And I think that plays out in what I do today,
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:31.680]  like really wanting to deliver something beyond. And I can trace it back to that happening.
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:38.480]  And I am pretty hesitant to, all these people are paid very well. They all choose to work there.
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:43.200]  They could all get jobs somewhere else. And I am a little hesitant in my high horse and tell,
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.120]  and like, say that I need to take care of them and what they do. If you want to talk to me
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:50.560]  about Amazon's warehouse workers, I'm happy to have the conversation because they're in a much
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:56.720]  worse position. But the white collar workers, that kind of aspect irked me about the article.
[1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:01.200]  Yeah. You've covered everything I wanted to cover and put kind of put your finger on it better
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:07.680]  than me. And I, to me, it was the, I hear what you're saying about the condensation about,
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:10.400]  like, yeah, like you said, like, you know, that they're working, they're busting their
[1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:16.000]  asses for 20 hours a day, and turn emails after midnight to send, you know, scotch tape to people
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.680]  overnight, or to, you know, do it in one day instead of two. And I agree with that. And I feel
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:26.080]  like that's sort of like saying that New York Times writers are busting their asses to send
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:32.320]  pulped up dead trees to people the next every morning, 365 days a year. You're kind of missing the
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:38.880]  point. It does make people happy when they have a good experience with Amazon, right? Where you're
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.920]  like, you know, your, some pair of boots breaks, and you can get like the exact right pair of
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:49.360]  replacement shoelaces. And they're, they're the next day. That's actually really cool. Like,
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:53.120]  whereas like in, you know, pre Amazon or if Amazon doesn't have what you're looking for, like,
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:56.720]  where do you go to get a specific kind of shoelaces like in the real world? Like,
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:00.240]  they've made the world a better place. And I know there's other places where you can buy
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:04.560]  shoelaces than Amazon, but Amazon's often the place I go to first. So it's a thing which
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:08.880]  at the beginning, like if you have a great service experience, like, it actually brightens your whole
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:14.720]  day. That thing you order something at Amazon and shows up a day early. Like, it's, it's cool. And
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:20.960]  it's okay that it's cool. Like, we're, we're humans. Like, not everything has to be like our eating
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:25.440]  our vegetables. Yeah. And the other thing that really got me about it was the way that they,
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:31.360]  I thought the article really conflated entirely different aspects of it. Like, exactly what you said.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:38.720]  If there are HR problems, like, like a lack of tolerance, you know, poor, poor, poor responses
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:43.600]  after a maternity leave or an illness leave or something like that, that's really bad. I mean,
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:47.360]  that's over the line. And it really, it's like a red alert going off. You know, like, that's
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  like a siren should be flashing. If it's that you had a crummy idea or a poorly thought through
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:58.400]  idea and you were told this is a crummy idea and it's poorly thought through, that's harsh.
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:02.320]  And I've been there. I mean, I think everybody has. I mean, I've been there. It hurts,
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:05.680]  but it's, you know, the way it works. And I don't know how that's different than other companies.
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:13.280]  How is that different than Pixar, which has a famously ruthless, not ruthless meaning mean or
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:18.960]  personal, but just in terms of being really, really hard to get a story through. And that
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:22.480]  they always say over and over and over again, everything starts with story. And they have this
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:27.040]  story making process that's entirely collaborative. And you have to keep coming back
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:31.920]  to the same group of your colleagues and peers and presenting your story. And they're going to
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:35.600]  pick it apart and tell you everything that's wrong with it. And you keep coming back,
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:40.560]  that's how they make Pixar movies like Pixar movies don't get made. And they don't have the track
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.520]  record that they have of one hit after another by having story meetings where they want to make
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:50.240]  sure that whoever's presenting feels good coming out of it. I'll tell you, I mean, there's an
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:53.840]  apple too. I mean, there's that anecdote. I actually, when I was at Apple got a here Johnny,
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:58.720]  I've speak and he shared it then, but it was repeated in that New Yorker article where John,
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:05.040]  I think it was coming out of meeting and either job, I was asking jobs why he was so critical,
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:10.640]  or I've confided in jobs that he was disappointed in the presentation as I heard it in the
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:16.240]  story. It was, I've confided in jobs that he was disappointed in the presentation. And and
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:21.600]  jobs had to him like that was a very selfish thing to do. And I was like, what? I was trying to be
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:27.040]  nice to the guy. And and and jobs like, no, you were trying to make him like you. Like you were
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:31.360]  concerned about him not liking you. If you were honest about the mistake, he's like, and actually
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:35.280]  you're doing an incredible disservice and you're doing a company disservice and you should be ashamed
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:40.880]  of yourself. And I was like, like it just told like he was super pissed at jobs. He's saying,
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:47.280]  but like it totally transformed the way he viewed his job and what he did. Like if he wasn't honest
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:53.680]  with what was in front of him, he was doing everyone into service in the pursuit of wanting people
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:59.440]  to like him. And like that was just deadly for him and for the company and and all that. And
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.080]  I mean, Basil says he doesn't want to be like Microsoft, people don't Microsoft being this
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:08.960]  in fighting and all his back fighting and stuff. The reality is the old Microsoft,
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:16.240]  at least legend has it back in the 90s when Gates was there vicious and vicious in a like this sucks
[1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:21.680]  like it should have been better. And frankly, when I was there, the issue that I heard of
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:29.200]  Microsoft was the like I the reason I didn't get promoted my first year was I was told my what was
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:35.680]  great, but my how was poor. Like basically I was told I was too blunt and I and like people like
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:41.760]  felt uncomfortable with my what I said in meetings and and like and so that what happened was you
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:45.520]  do get the back fighting in business because that always exists because we're humans, but that all
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:51.440]  happens back channels and behind the scenes, right? And this is what like far better it happened
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.000]  in the open than in these back channels. And where Microsoft, I think has gone gone wrong in some
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:01.920]  respects is all that viciousness never went away. It just got taken off the top table and being
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:06.720]  visible to everyone and got stuffed underneath. And then you get this toxic environment that
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:13.840]  I mean you used to say I left different two years. But I don't know, sorry, that was a bit of a rant.
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:18.720]  No, that's all right. One thing I remember as a last thought is I took a screenwriting class in
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:25.440]  college and I enjoyed it greatly and it was taught by a guy who used to work on alpha and he worked
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:30.400]  on a bunch of you know everything from from PBS shows that were truly serious to like the alpha
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:35.920]  Saturday morning cartoon show. And he said that you know we had these crits every week everybody would
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:40.800]  you'd have to hand in your your writing on a certain day and then there were copies and this is
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:45.440]  pre digital and everybody got a copy at the end of class and then you'd have to read it for the next
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:49.440]  class and then we would each we'd have a crit and everybody would discuss each other's work. And he
[1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:56.000]  said this is how how Hollywood works. You criticize the work, not the the writer. It's not personal.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.640]  You don't say you should have done this. You talk about like the character should have said this
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:04.640]  or the dialogue isn't right. You don't say, you know, like if you and I had both written something
[1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:09.760]  and I wouldn't say Ben, you did a crappy job with the dialogue here. You just say this line of
[1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:13.920]  dialogue doesn't ring true to me. It doesn't sound like something that this character would say.
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:17.920]  It's the work, not the person. That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when you walk away and you know
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:22.960]  that you've got a marked up screenplay that's full of really, really astute criticism, but it's
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:26.720]  not precious. Especially if you've invested yourself in the screenplay and that's where it's tough
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:33.360]  right because the best work comes when you put yourself into it. And so to be able to manage
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:38.480]  someone criticizing your work and they may be doing it correctly, but you identify so deeply with him
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:43.360]  that it's hard to handle. I get that. And yeah, no, I think we're on the same page. I get the
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:48.720]  also the extra hours thing. But again, these are these are adults making well into the six figures
[1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:54.720]  which particularly include stock compensation. Like that's for them. That's for them to decide.
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:53:59.920]  And the truth is, I don't know anyone who works at a successful tech company, particularly
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:06.400]  either one that Apple and Amazon kind of they compete on the user experience, which requires
[1:54:06.400 --> 1:54:11.600]  that much more perfection and attention to detail or the early stage of any company when they're
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:17.120]  building their competitive advantage that doesn't. I mean, and maybe this is part of people's
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:22.880]  reaction. They don't want they don't want to admit that there's a choice. I mean, I do believe
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:30.560]  you can't have it all. Like you can't be an attentive father or an attentive husband and be a senior
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:35.520]  vice president at Amazon. I don't think it's possible or Apple for that matter. And it's something
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.600]  that I don't think we like to talk about because we like to think about Apple being this great
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:43.680]  company or Amazon industry company. We love their products. We don't want to like like I think
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:49.120]  there's an aspect of guilt almost that comes with these articles and is part of why people react so
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:54.560]  strongly to them. Yeah. I agree with that completely. Ben Thompson, I thank you for your time.
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:55:05.200]  People can find more of your writing at stratecory.com. And season two of exponent will be next
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:12.080]  episode becoming out next week. So I'm back in the podcast chair. That is your podcast co-hosted
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:22.960]  with James Allworth. Yes. You guys talk about basketball. No. We talk about basketball to the extent
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:28.720]  where I make fun of James for having no idea about any sort of sport. Did you see that though that
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:37.120]  what's the same is back on Twitter and the guy got fired from ESPN. Bill Simmons. Yeah. Bill
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:43.760]  Simmons. And he called out Steve Balmer as yeah, over his head on the Clippers. Yep. That was
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.440]  I cannot believe I just blanked on Bill Simmons's name. That's what happens when you're 90 minutes
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:53.920]  into a podcast. Anyway, thank you. I will let you go and talk to you soon. I look forward to hearing
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:56:09.840]  the next episode of your show. Sounds good. I'll see you soon. All right.
