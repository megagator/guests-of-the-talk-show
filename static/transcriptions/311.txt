[00:00.000 --> 00:05.320]  It's free, but if you don't wear glasses, you're not welcome.
[00:05.320 --> 00:08.360]  So anyway, the WWDC announcement went up today.
[00:08.360 --> 00:11.200]  So we're lucky that we're recording this afternoon.
[00:11.200 --> 00:15.040]  And the theme of the invitations,
[00:15.040 --> 00:20.960]  it's a slew of widely diverse Memoji characters looking
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.080]  at opening a creepily, not creepily, that's the wrong word.
[00:27.080 --> 00:34.160]  Craigly opening a MacBook and having various icons
[00:34.160 --> 00:38.120]  from the MacBook screen reflected in their glasses.
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.960]  If you could only find someone to love you
[00:39.960 --> 00:44.880]  the way Craig loves that M1 Mac, you'd do well in life.
[00:44.880 --> 00:45.840]  That's such a fun.
[00:49.960 --> 00:52.280]  They knew what they were doing when they did that, right?
[00:52.280 --> 00:54.800]  It's not like they were surprised by the reaction.
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.680]  And there is, from my interactions
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.720]  with Craig Federighi, he's done my show a couple of times.
[01:03.720 --> 01:06.560]  And I've gotten to talk to him backstage.
[01:06.560 --> 01:08.400]  He's the guy you think he is.
[01:08.400 --> 01:11.560]  That is him.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.760]  So that's a fun little callback for the invitation.
[01:13.760 --> 01:16.480]  But of course, people are going bananas,
[01:16.480 --> 01:19.600]  thinking that the fact that they're all wearing glasses
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.160]  and that you see bits of software reflected
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.280]  in the glasses is that it's a hint that the AR glasses
[01:26.280 --> 01:32.480]  announcement might be coming at WWDC, to which I say, maybe.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.640]  But I wouldn't bet on it.
[01:34.640 --> 01:35.400]  What do you think?
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.880]  I was more surprised and excited that it was Mac front
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.040]  and center in the invitation.
[01:41.040 --> 01:42.720]  Yeah, I liked that, too.
[01:42.720 --> 01:44.080]  I totally dug that.
[01:44.080 --> 01:46.920]  I thought that, too.
[01:46.920 --> 01:49.120]  Was it 2010 there wasn't even any Mac
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.200]  at WWDC, one of those years?
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.080]  Yeah, there was.
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.040]  Or getting little tiny coffins ready.
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.200]  There was a year of the go-go iOS era, which, again, people
[02:00.200 --> 02:02.280]  read into that and thought, well, this is a sure sign
[02:02.280 --> 02:03.600]  that the Mac is going away.
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.160]  But it was really just a reaction
[02:06.160 --> 02:13.520]  to the crazy gold rush era of iOS developers
[02:13.520 --> 02:16.240]  storming into the Apple platform.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.320]  Yeah.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.080]  I don't know.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.440]  What do you think about the invitation?
[02:19.440 --> 02:21.280]  This year, no one's panicking that there's
[02:21.280 --> 02:23.600]  no iPhone in the invitation.
[02:23.600 --> 02:24.120]  Yeah, right.
[02:24.120 --> 02:28.920]  Nobody's reading into this that the iPhone is going away.
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.480]  Yeah, I always like these.
[02:30.480 --> 02:32.280]  Because, well, you and I, we know
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.040]  people who've been on or are on Apple's graphic design team.
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.400]  And they just get given a brief.
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.400]  They're not given any context, any background.
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.360]  They're just like, it would be great if it looked like bokeh.
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.360]  You know, bokeh lights.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.520]  Or it would be great if it looked like this,
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.000]  and they just go off and make it.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.160]  And then they watch everyone talk about it on Twitter
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.360]  and laugh and drink.
[02:49.360 --> 02:53.160]  And celebrate all this smart and dumb stuff that we say.
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.040]  So this is just, they probably just
[02:55.040 --> 02:57.720]  were told the way Craig looked at that MacBook,
[02:57.720 --> 03:01.440]  that, but with a diverse range of emoji.
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.840]  Did you notice that one of the emoji is a fellow.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.480]  Maybe there's more than one, but I don't know how many there are.
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.240]  But there's one where the fellow's wearing a hearing aid.
[03:11.240 --> 03:17.080]  I mean, just as a nice, to me, elevation of accessibility
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.000]  stuff to being front and center on their list
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.040]  of diverse adjectives to include in the characters.
[03:26.040 --> 03:27.240]  Yeah, it's a smart nod, too.
[03:27.240 --> 03:30.960]  And the WWDC Swift Scholarship has the same,
[03:30.960 --> 03:33.320]  I believe it's the same person, but a younger version
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.880]  with a graduate cap on to signify students,
[03:35.880 --> 03:38.880]  which is nice.
[03:38.880 --> 03:39.880]  So what do you think?
[03:39.880 --> 03:41.440]  Do you think glasses are coming?
[03:41.440 --> 03:43.240]  I mean, they've got to be coming eventually.
[03:43.240 --> 03:45.680]  Whether they're coming this year or not,
[03:45.680 --> 03:48.640]  I still feel like something that could be an acceptable glasses
[03:48.640 --> 03:49.440]  product.
[03:49.440 --> 03:50.360]  It's a little early.
[03:50.360 --> 03:53.200]  Even if we assume that they're introducing frameworks
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.280]  at WWDC that will give them a six-month or one-year lead
[03:57.280 --> 03:59.360]  time before there's an actual product,
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.800]  or if there's a developer-specific hardware
[04:01.800 --> 04:04.600]  test the way they've been, like the Mac developer
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.120]  kit for the M1 processor.
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.040]  Even if there's something like that,
[04:09.040 --> 04:10.760]  it still feels really early to me.
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.600]  So I wonder if it's just, hey, we
[04:12.600 --> 04:14.680]  want to show a little bit of software in this.
[04:14.680 --> 04:16.600]  We could do reflections in glasses.
[04:16.600 --> 04:17.440]  Yeah.
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.200]  And I wrote in my little write-up on Daring Fireball,
[04:22.200 --> 04:24.160]  like there's also no way that Apple
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.360]  didn't realize that people would read into this.
[04:27.360 --> 04:29.000]  I think the most likely explanation
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  is they wanted to play off the Federighi thing from the M1
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.600]  announcement.
[04:35.600 --> 04:38.760]  The brief was that if some of the characters
[04:38.760 --> 04:40.240]  are wearing glasses, they should all
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.000]  wear glasses because that's sort of the part of the,
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  if some of the characters weren't wearing glasses,
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.680]  you wouldn't see the screen reflection.
[04:48.680 --> 04:54.280]  And having those icons in the reflected lenses is like,
[04:54.280 --> 04:56.560]  that's the art direction.
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.560]  And the fact that people might read into it
[04:58.560 --> 05:04.320]  because Apple's AR VR efforts are probably
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.760]  at the top of the list of anticipated products
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.560]  that they are apparently rumored to be working on, so be it.
[05:13.560 --> 05:14.720]  Because there's no harm done.
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.040]  And it's not like, oh, if WWDC's keynote comes to pass
[05:18.040 --> 05:22.560]  and there's no mention of any kind of glasses or goggles,
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.120]  it's not like you could say that Apple ripped us off.
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.920]  They just had characters wearing glasses.
[05:27.920 --> 05:31.560]  It's sort of a free way to tease us if it's just a teaser.
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.560]  And they keep doing it.
[05:32.560 --> 05:33.840]  That's the thing.
[05:33.840 --> 05:36.040]  I wonder if this is an elaborate troll at some point
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.000]  because when there was the September event
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.240]  and they had that AR logo that would morph and change,
[05:41.240 --> 05:43.760]  everyone was sure that AR would be the big focus
[05:43.760 --> 05:44.680]  in September.
[05:44.680 --> 05:47.400]  And then previous to that, one of the characters
[05:47.400 --> 05:49.560]  was wearing glasses in the WWDC artwork.
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.840]  And then Phil Schiller's Memoji got glasses.
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.720]  And they were sure that that was a sign
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.360]  that we were going to be getting the Apple.
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.360]  I think we just want to see it so much that we
[05:57.360 --> 05:58.200]  lay it on anything.
[05:58.200 --> 06:01.280]  And Apple's smart to sort of lean into it.
[06:01.280 --> 06:02.040]  Right.
[06:02.040 --> 06:03.920]  It might be.
[06:03.920 --> 06:07.080]  Honestly, I wouldn't put this past them.
[06:07.080 --> 06:10.440]  Like, the rumors are twofold.
[06:10.440 --> 06:11.720]  And it makes sense because they're
[06:11.720 --> 06:12.720]  very different products.
[06:12.720 --> 06:17.280]  There's the rumor of VR goggles that cover your screen
[06:17.280 --> 06:20.160]  like Robocop.
[06:20.160 --> 06:24.600]  And you're looking at a screen, or two screens really,
[06:24.600 --> 06:25.640]  one per eye.
[06:25.640 --> 06:28.920]  One of the rumors is that there's two 8K displays, one
[06:28.920 --> 06:30.320]  for each eye.
[06:30.320 --> 06:34.760]  And then a camera on the outside would show reality.
[06:34.760 --> 06:38.920]  So it's like you're wearing a camera on your eyes.
[06:38.920 --> 06:42.880]  And then the other product would be the AR glasses, where you're
[06:42.880 --> 06:45.880]  just wearing see-through glasses.
[06:45.880 --> 06:47.560]  Like, if their battery was out, you'd
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.960]  still be able to see through them.
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.800]  They look like regular prescription eyeglasses,
[06:52.800 --> 06:58.360]  but somehow project an image onto the lenses.
[06:58.360 --> 07:00.760]  Google glasses, remember those?
[07:00.760 --> 07:01.680]  Yeah.
[07:01.680 --> 07:02.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:02.920 --> 07:05.600]  Google glasses were sort of along those lines.
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.120]  I think that they had a screen that you could actually
[07:08.120 --> 07:09.520]  see the little screen, and it only
[07:09.520 --> 07:11.640]  projected it onto the one lens.
[07:11.640 --> 07:12.480]  It was like the Borg.
[07:12.480 --> 07:15.160]  It was like that little Borg, the cutest Borg
[07:15.160 --> 07:16.480]  thing in front of your face.
[07:16.480 --> 07:19.160]  Right, and according to the rumor mill,
[07:19.160 --> 07:21.160]  and this is why I wanted you on the show this week.
[07:21.160 --> 07:26.520]  This is the rumor episode of the talk show.
[07:26.520 --> 07:30.840]  According to the rumor mill, the VR product
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.400]  is closer to shipping than the AR product, which
[07:35.400 --> 07:38.560]  would be like, you would just go get prescription glasses
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.360]  and have a magical heads-up display in front of you
[07:42.360 --> 07:44.000]  and an interaction model.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.080]  And that makes sense, but that is true, right?
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.480]  Like, the rumor mill is sort of like, maybe the VR thing
[07:49.480 --> 07:54.760]  is a 2022 thing, and the AR thing is maybe a 2023 thing.
[07:54.760 --> 07:55.400]  Yeah.
[07:55.400 --> 07:56.800]  Yeah, and it makes sense to me.
[07:56.800 --> 07:59.000]  Having both those products, and I
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.120]  think I don't mean that it's half-instantial
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.040]  that they're both under, you know, Dan Riccio now,
[08:04.040 --> 08:06.040]  they're both in the same special projects group,
[08:06.040 --> 08:09.520]  but I think it's two products, like really two focuses.
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.880]  The VR headset sounds like a next generation Apple TV.
[08:12.880 --> 08:15.040]  You know, Apple's never going to make a television set.
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.280]  There's no margin in it.
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.880]  There's no update, really good update path in it.
[08:18.880 --> 08:21.840]  But a VR headset could take all the entertainment, all
[08:21.840 --> 08:25.120]  the gaming, all the fitness plus stuff, just all the content
[08:25.120 --> 08:27.640]  that Apple's working on, and turn it into a device
[08:27.640 --> 08:30.280]  that each person has to buy their own, basically,
[08:30.280 --> 08:33.000]  at a really high premium, perfect Apple product.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.280]  And then the glasses sound like a next generation Apple
[08:35.280 --> 08:37.520]  Watch, where it's wearable, it's tricked out.
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.960]  Like, it's even more convenient.
[08:38.960 --> 08:40.720]  You don't even have to lift your wrist anymore.
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.120]  The notifications, the sensors, are all just built right
[08:43.120 --> 08:44.560]  in front of your face.
[08:44.560 --> 08:47.080]  And that sort of takes the Apple Watch into the future.
[08:47.080 --> 08:49.160]  And both those things make a lot of sense to me
[08:49.160 --> 08:52.120]  as distinct things, not like a holdover between one
[08:52.120 --> 08:53.560]  and the other.
[08:53.560 --> 08:56.640]  Right, so given that loose timeline,
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.560]  and it makes sense that the AR product would be further ahead,
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.520]  harder to make, right, like this VR product is more or less
[09:06.520 --> 09:09.440]  an iPhone in front of your face.
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.280]  And a little different.
[09:10.280 --> 09:12.640]  And it can have vents and a fan, and can run an M1 style
[09:12.640 --> 09:16.360]  processor, like all those things.
[09:16.360 --> 09:18.440]  No vents, no fan, but you know.
[09:18.440 --> 09:19.400]  No, I'm sure they're going to.
[09:19.400 --> 09:20.600]  I think if they want the amount of,
[09:20.600 --> 09:22.080]  because remember the rumor was they're
[09:22.080 --> 09:24.640]  going to have a separate box, and Johnny kiboshed that.
[09:24.640 --> 09:26.800]  So they're going to put all that compute power in.
[09:26.800 --> 09:28.760]  They need something as big as a VR headset
[09:28.760 --> 09:30.240]  to put all that compute power in.
[09:30.240 --> 09:32.040]  You really think that, you were serious.
[09:32.040 --> 09:33.040]  I thought you were making a joke.
[09:33.040 --> 09:34.600]  I don't think there'll be any vents or fan.
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.440]  There's no vents or fan.
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.920]  Well, I don't think fan, but like, sort of like what
[09:37.920 --> 09:38.880]  they're doing with the Mac.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.440]  It's like, I can't hear what they're
[09:40.440 --> 09:42.440]  doing with the M1 MacBook Pro, but it's
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.240]  better than no cooling.
[09:44.240 --> 09:49.120]  Yeah, but if the MacBook Air doesn't need a fan,
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.000]  I can't help but believe that they're working on a product.
[09:52.000 --> 09:52.960]  That was one of the rumors.
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.760]  So like, I would rather not have it either,
[09:54.760 --> 09:57.800]  but that was listed like high up in the information's rumors.
[09:57.800 --> 09:59.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.680]  And I always thought that rumor, back when Johnny was there.
[10:04.680 --> 10:07.360]  The idea that it would be tethered to a box at all
[10:07.360 --> 10:10.080]  just seems like a non-starter.
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.160]  I never believed that.
[10:12.160 --> 10:15.200]  I think the product has to be completely untethered.
[10:15.200 --> 10:17.120]  Same.
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.160]  But anyway, to go with what I'm thinking in my Kremlinology
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.120]  aspect of looking into these WWDC announcements,
[10:25.120 --> 10:28.760]  and maybe even the little subtle things like Phil Schiller's
[10:28.760 --> 10:32.120]  Memoji getting glasses over there,
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.840]  is that they're just subtly making, hey,
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.120]  it's cool to wear eyeglasses all the time.
[10:38.120 --> 10:38.680]  Yeah.
[10:38.680 --> 10:39.800]  Right?
[10:39.800 --> 10:40.880]  That's, you know.
[10:40.880 --> 10:41.720]  Boiling water.
[10:44.680 --> 10:45.200]  You know?
[10:45.200 --> 10:46.640]  Even thinking Memoji are like that,
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.200]  like just getting people used to having an AR presence.
[10:49.200 --> 10:50.960]  Because it's not going to be comfortable for a lot of people,
[10:50.960 --> 10:53.880]  but if they get us in there with the iPhone, the iPad early,
[10:53.880 --> 10:56.160]  they get us to make our fun little Memoji characters
[10:56.160 --> 10:58.560]  so we're used to seeing avatars of ourselves
[10:58.560 --> 10:59.800]  in an AR world.
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.640]  I think all of this stuff is really smart pre-marketing
[11:02.640 --> 11:04.200]  for those products.
[11:04.200 --> 11:06.520]  I mean, that's the thing about the AR glasses, right?
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.520]  It's like, before the Apple Watch, a lot of people,
[11:10.520 --> 11:13.680]  commonly, very common, I hear it now, but a little bit less so.
[11:13.680 --> 11:15.840]  But a lot of people were like, I don't wear a watch.
[11:15.840 --> 11:18.880]  So I don't, you know, watch, I don't
[11:18.880 --> 11:22.760]  know what the percentage of adults wearing wristwatches
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.000]  was pre-Apple Watch.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.040]  But it certainly, I would wager with certainty
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.880]  that it skewed lower as a percentage
[11:34.880 --> 11:36.880]  as you go lower in age brackets.
[11:36.880 --> 11:39.000]  That the younger people are, the less likely
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.480]  they were to regularly wear a wristwatch.
[11:43.480 --> 11:46.040]  And you know, it makes a ton of sense.
[11:46.040 --> 11:48.720]  And the most common explanation is, why would I wear a watch?
[11:48.720 --> 11:50.200]  I have a phone with me.
[11:50.200 --> 11:52.560]  If I ever need to check the time, I look at my phone.
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.480]  And it's sort of like the phone as the return of the pocket watch.
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.240]  Yeah.
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.280]  That makes sense.
[11:59.280 --> 12:05.840]  But the pitch for, OK, you know, the pitch
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.520]  for you always wore a watch and now we
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.560]  want you to wear an Apple Watch is easier,
[12:14.560 --> 12:16.760]  I think, than you never wore a watch
[12:16.760 --> 12:19.480]  and now we want you to wear an Apple Watch.
[12:19.480 --> 12:24.760]  But even so, it's like asking you to overcome the,
[12:24.760 --> 12:27.720]  well, I'm not used to having a thing that I
[12:27.720 --> 12:30.480]  can feel on my wrist and it feels weird
[12:30.480 --> 12:32.000]  because I never wear a watch.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.840]  But it doesn't really affect the way you look.
[12:34.840 --> 12:38.640]  Whereas if you have perfectly good vision
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.920]  or you wear contact lenses, asking
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.400]  you to spend all day wearing glasses is a big ask.
[12:46.400 --> 12:48.440]  I mean, we don't know anything about this product.
[12:48.440 --> 12:50.240]  I realize this is two years out.
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.480]  But it's a weird thing and it affects the way
[12:54.480 --> 12:56.560]  people look significantly.
[12:56.560 --> 12:58.640]  People look different wearing glasses
[12:58.640 --> 13:00.040]  and they might not want to do it.
[13:00.040 --> 13:03.400]  And I can say as somebody who spent 40-some years wearing
[13:03.400 --> 13:07.400]  contact lenses and the last two or three years full time
[13:07.400 --> 13:09.880]  wearing glasses, wearing glasses sucks.
[13:09.880 --> 13:11.360]  Yes.
[13:11.360 --> 13:12.480]  Yeah, no, same.
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.400]  And the other thing that's sort of inopportune about this
[13:17.400 --> 13:18.880]  is people do wear sunglasses.
[13:18.880 --> 13:20.520]  Famously, people love to wear sunglasses.
[13:20.520 --> 13:23.240]  People with perfect vision wear sunglasses a lot.
[13:23.240 --> 13:24.600]  But it sounds like the technology
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.960]  to make it work on sunglasses is harder
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.840]  than to make it work on clear glasses.
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.120]  Right, and so again, it's a real sci-fi sounding product
[13:34.120 --> 13:34.760]  at this point.
[13:34.760 --> 13:37.360]  But let's say you do get it.
[13:37.360 --> 13:39.960]  You're like, well, I do wear glasses.
[13:39.960 --> 13:41.960]  So I'll just switch to wearing Apple glasses.
[13:41.960 --> 13:44.600]  And the heads up information proves
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.800]  to be extremely useful and addictive.
[13:47.800 --> 13:51.000]  And you're like, oh, I can't imagine going back
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.240]  to not wearing Apple glasses.
[13:53.240 --> 13:55.520]  But then you're going out in the sunshine
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.320]  and you have to swap them for other glasses.
[13:58.320 --> 14:00.240]  And you miss, now you don't have a glass.
[14:00.240 --> 14:00.800]  I don't know.
[14:00.800 --> 14:02.280]  I don't know what the solution is.
[14:02.280 --> 14:03.720]  And I realize it's years away.
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.000]  But I feel like it's got to be solved.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.400]  And I don't know that it's ever going to work together.
[14:09.400 --> 14:12.040]  It's got to be solved, and I don't know that it's ever
[14:12.040 --> 14:15.040]  going to work to get those, what do they call them?
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.200]  Not progressive.
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.560]  Yeah, transitions, which always look weird to me
[14:19.560 --> 14:22.120]  when people come in from the sunshine
[14:22.120 --> 14:24.720]  and it looks like they're trying to look cool,
[14:24.720 --> 14:27.120]  wearing sunglasses.
[14:27.120 --> 14:29.200]  But maybe that's one of those things
[14:29.200 --> 14:31.880]  where Apple can surprise us with their engineering
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.320]  expertise in a materials field outside computer.
[14:37.320 --> 14:38.360]  I don't know.
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.800]  I think Kuo Ming-Chi said that they're
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.400]  trying to make it into contact lenses for like 2030
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.760]  or something.
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.200]  That seems pretty far out.
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.480]  But again, we've seen it in sci-fi movies for years.
[14:50.480 --> 14:53.720]  So surely it's coming, because everything always comes true.
[14:53.720 --> 14:56.080]  Yeah, well, then one day we'll do Old Man Gruber's talk show
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.440]  and talk about Apple cybernetics.
[14:57.440 --> 14:58.640]  I mean, everything's coming.
[15:01.920 --> 15:03.240]  Which implant series did you get?
[15:03.240 --> 15:04.560]  2.0 implant was so much better.
[15:04.560 --> 15:06.000]  I should have waited.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.720]  The other thing, the thing about Apple invitations,
[15:07.720 --> 15:11.520]  I always feel like there's more to read into the slogans
[15:11.520 --> 15:13.080]  than the artwork.
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.480]  So they had the Time Flies event last September.
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.920]  And I thought, well, that means the headliner of this event
[15:19.920 --> 15:21.920]  is going to be the watch.
[15:21.920 --> 15:25.320]  And then other people had these complicated explanations
[15:25.320 --> 15:29.040]  for how, no, no, no, that actually means the iPhones
[15:29.040 --> 15:31.040]  are coming in September.
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.760]  I was like, no, Time Flies really
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.280]  sounds like the watch to me.
[15:35.280 --> 15:36.880]  Yeah, it's either the watch or flight.
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.240]  And I'm pretty sure they don't have flight.
[15:40.240 --> 15:41.400]  What was another good one?
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.680]  I think there's something in the air.
[15:43.680 --> 15:45.320]  Remember that one?
[15:45.320 --> 15:48.440]  And it was at, I think it was at a WWDC.
[15:48.440 --> 15:49.440]  Maybe it was a Macworld.
[15:49.440 --> 15:52.360]  But I remember the banners were hanging in Moscone.
[15:52.360 --> 15:53.960]  And it was one of those years where
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.080]  the banners were photographed by long lens sharpshooters
[15:59.080 --> 16:01.640]  from across the street in advance.
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.000]  And if I'm recalling correctly, there's
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.440]  something in the air that was going to be the MacBook Air.
[16:10.440 --> 16:13.240]  And that was the year that Steve Jobs famously took it out
[16:13.240 --> 16:15.360]  of a Manila envelope.
[16:15.360 --> 16:16.960]  But I remember there were people who
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.240]  thought it meant that they had a partnership with Adobe
[16:19.240 --> 16:22.600]  to make Adobe Air a new developer platform.
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.080]  And it's like, no, no, they're not going to.
[16:28.080 --> 16:30.720]  They've been swimming against the tide in all things
[16:30.720 --> 16:33.320]  developer-related to own the full stack.
[16:33.320 --> 16:36.560]  They're not going to.
[16:36.560 --> 16:38.000]  And it was like Adobe Air doesn't
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.840]  seem like it's going anywhere.
[16:39.840 --> 16:41.280]  Occam's razor, I think, is not often
[16:41.280 --> 16:44.080]  applied when it comes to Apple imitations.
[16:44.080 --> 16:45.520]  Right, there's no slogan for this.
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.920]  It's just WWDC 21.
[16:47.920 --> 16:49.280]  The dates.
[16:49.280 --> 16:50.080]  The glow, right?
[16:50.080 --> 16:51.920]  Is the glow a slogan?
[16:51.920 --> 16:52.840]  I don't think so.
[16:52.840 --> 16:54.400]  Is it?
[16:54.400 --> 16:57.320]  I mean, it's such a weird slogan.
[17:00.080 --> 17:00.720]  What is it again?
[17:00.720 --> 17:02.480]  Glow.
[17:02.480 --> 17:03.960]  Oh, there is a slogan?
[17:03.960 --> 17:06.400]  Yeah, it's on the development, Glow and Behold.
[17:06.400 --> 17:07.840]  Oh.
[17:07.840 --> 17:09.040]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.880]  If you go to developer.apple.com slash WWDC 21,
[17:12.880 --> 17:14.720]  the Craig book opens.
[17:14.720 --> 17:17.320]  And then it just says, Glow and Behold.
[17:17.320 --> 17:19.720]  With a period, which is, millennials
[17:19.720 --> 17:22.080]  are going to read as hostile.
[17:22.080 --> 17:23.840]  Oh, they need to get over that.
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.920]  I've got my son trained.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.320]  He knows that I end my text with a period.
[17:31.320 --> 17:33.960]  That doesn't mean anything.
[17:33.960 --> 17:35.960]  I'm going to say that that means nothing,
[17:35.960 --> 17:37.960]  and that it's just a play on the art direction,
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.280]  and that maybe it's like they have a,
[17:43.280 --> 17:45.440]  because they don't want to hint at anything specific,
[17:45.440 --> 17:48.120]  they're just going to play off the gimmick of the Craig
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.480]  Federighi style, Glow and Behold,
[17:50.480 --> 17:53.920]  and that there is nothing to read into it,
[17:53.920 --> 17:56.640]  in terms of any specific announcements.
[17:56.640 --> 17:58.640]  And it's not like they can just redo the Mac OS
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.000]  interface again after last year and make everything glow.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.080]  No, no, no, no, that'd be terrible.
[18:04.080 --> 18:06.240]  There'll be light mode, dark mode, and romance mode,
[18:06.240 --> 18:07.840]  which is a rosy color for Craig.
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.480]  Oh my God, that would be horrible.
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.040]  All right, let me take a break
[18:14.040 --> 18:17.840]  and thank our first sponsor, Sourcegraph.
[18:17.840 --> 18:20.240]  Do you spend too much time wandering aimlessly
[18:20.240 --> 18:22.680]  around your code base, speaking of developers,
[18:22.680 --> 18:24.280]  to find what you're looking for?
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.160]  Imagine if you could thoroughly search your code,
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.000]  all your code, private code, public code, open source code,
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  across every repo, every language, every code host.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.840]  You can, that is Sourcegraph's universal code search.
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.240]  With Sourcegraph, you can find anything in your code fast
[18:44.240 --> 18:46.320]  without losing your flow.
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.080]  Quickly navigate with contextual hover tool tips
[18:50.080 --> 18:53.400]  that show definitions, references, usage examples,
[18:53.400 --> 18:56.880]  and more, construct complex queries and filter code
[18:56.880 --> 19:00.840]  in ways that IDEs and code hosts can't.
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.440]  Sourcegraph has a visual and interactive query builder
[19:04.440 --> 19:07.160]  that supports regular expressions, yay,
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.720]  and syntax-aware pattern matching.
[19:09.720 --> 19:11.480]  So you get your answers in seconds.
[19:11.480 --> 19:14.880]  Universal code search is a developer's superpower.
[19:14.880 --> 19:18.560]  With it, you can find and fix bugs, do better code reviews,
[19:18.560 --> 19:21.720]  identify security risks, onboard to a new code base,
[19:21.720 --> 19:24.080]  and make large-scale refactors.
[19:24.080 --> 19:25.640]  Once you start using Sourcegraph,
[19:25.640 --> 19:28.960]  you wonder how you ever lived without it, get it now.
[19:28.960 --> 19:33.960]  Here's the URL, info.sourcegraph.com slash talk show.
[19:35.960 --> 19:40.960]  That's info.sourcegraph.com slash talk show.
[19:42.400 --> 19:45.720]  I thank Sourcegraph for sponsoring this episode
[19:45.720 --> 19:48.480]  of the talk show, well-timed for a developer tool.
[19:48.480 --> 19:53.480]  So timing-wise, maybe we're not so lucky recording today
[19:55.760 --> 20:00.760]  because we got to talk about the WWDC news coming out,
[20:01.240 --> 20:05.680]  but people are expecting an April event.
[20:05.680 --> 20:09.360]  Some people were expecting a March 23rd event.
[20:09.360 --> 20:12.320]  It seems like Apple is due for a product announcement event.
[20:12.320 --> 20:17.320]  They often hold events in late March, early April.
[20:17.320 --> 20:21.440]  It seems like they have a bunch of pending products,
[20:21.440 --> 20:23.200]  but no announcement yet.
[20:23.200 --> 20:28.200]  And today is Tuesday, as we record, Tuesday the 30th.
[20:29.320 --> 20:34.320]  Why is it that we were thinking April 7th as an event day,
[20:35.280 --> 20:37.360]  which is a Wednesday instead of April 6th,
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.520]  which is a Tuesday?
[20:40.680 --> 20:42.760]  Apple has such a weird,
[20:42.760 --> 20:45.720]  September has almost always been iPod and then iPhone,
[20:45.720 --> 20:49.160]  and October has been recently a lot about the Mac,
[20:49.160 --> 20:51.120]  but March has varied so much.
[20:51.120 --> 20:53.560]  Even if you discount 2020, because there was no event,
[20:53.560 --> 20:54.800]  it was 2020.
[20:54.800 --> 20:57.160]  The year before that, it was the services event
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.280]  where they did TV Plus and Arcade.
[20:59.280 --> 21:02.920]  And then they announced products like the AirPods 2
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.760]  in press releases around it, the iPad mini, the iPad Air.
[21:06.760 --> 21:09.440]  The year before that, it was the education event in Chicago
[21:09.440 --> 21:12.240]  where they did announce the low price iPad,
[21:12.240 --> 21:15.320]  but mostly it was a lot of educational initiatives.
[21:15.320 --> 21:18.520]  But then they've also done things like the 2015,
[21:18.520 --> 21:21.400]  they did the 12-inch MacBook,
[21:21.400 --> 21:23.720]  big product and a lot of the Apple Watch stuff.
[21:23.720 --> 21:25.160]  So it seems like this is the event
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.440]  that just does whatever they need it to do in the spring.
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.080]  Right, things that aren't necessarily on a regular schedule.
[21:30.080 --> 21:32.960]  The iPad Pros, for example, have been on,
[21:34.200 --> 21:38.600]  not a random schedule, but a somewhat irregular schedule.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.440]  Like last year's- Like 18 months-ish?
[21:40.440 --> 21:45.440]  Yeah, and last year's were a unique upgrade
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.480]  where it was just going from the A12X to the A12Z.
[21:50.480 --> 21:53.080]  And the only difference was that the GPU
[21:53.080 --> 21:54.720]  went from seven cores to eight cores.
[21:54.720 --> 21:58.800]  And they added the LIDAR sensor.
[21:58.800 --> 21:59.920]  The wide angle, yeah.
[22:02.560 --> 22:04.960]  So that was a weird update.
[22:04.960 --> 22:05.800]  I think we're-
[22:05.800 --> 22:07.000]  And the Magic Keyboard was new.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  We got the Magic Keyboard and the iPhone SE.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.400]  Right, and the update to iPad OS
[22:11.400 --> 22:15.080]  to support the trackpad and mouse system-wide,
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.320]  which was, in my opinion,
[22:16.320 --> 22:18.820]  a bigger deal than the actual hardware.
[22:22.120 --> 22:23.520]  So I don't know.
[22:23.520 --> 22:26.320]  I kind of feel, and people are going to have to,
[22:26.320 --> 22:31.000]  this episode won't air until tomorrow, the 31st.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  I would say there's more than a 50% chance
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.080]  that we'll get an announcement tomorrow
[22:39.080 --> 22:40.960]  that there's going to be an event
[22:40.960 --> 22:44.160]  on seven days later on April 7th.
[22:44.160 --> 22:48.440]  I'm going to put the odds at 60%.
[22:48.440 --> 22:49.280]  Okay.
[22:49.280 --> 22:50.320]  But people, if it happens,
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.320]  people will have to take my word for it
[22:52.320 --> 22:55.520]  that we were recording this on the 30th.
[22:55.520 --> 22:56.360]  What do you think?
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.200]  Is there a significance to the sev-
[22:58.200 --> 23:00.440]  Because is there like something in the US or a holiday
[23:00.440 --> 23:01.400]  or anything that would push it
[23:01.400 --> 23:03.520]  from like a Tuesday to a Wednesday this month?
[23:03.520 --> 23:06.440]  I can't think the Easter is on Sunday,
[23:06.440 --> 23:10.920]  but why would that preclude using Tuesday, right?
[23:10.920 --> 23:12.840]  I mean, even Monday after Easter
[23:12.840 --> 23:15.560]  isn't really considered a holiday, you know?
[23:15.560 --> 23:16.960]  I mean, they don't do events on Monday.
[23:16.960 --> 23:19.760]  They typically only do them on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
[23:19.760 --> 23:22.880]  And maybe like, there's like one weird example
[23:22.880 --> 23:24.240]  where there was one on a Thursday,
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.960]  but Tuesday and Wednesday are usually the days.
[23:27.960 --> 23:28.800]  I don't know.
[23:28.800 --> 23:30.320]  I mean, and maybe they announce it tomorrow
[23:30.320 --> 23:31.640]  and it's Tuesday the 6th.
[23:31.640 --> 23:33.480]  I still think though that the announcement
[23:33.480 --> 23:34.320]  could come tomorrow.
[23:34.320 --> 23:37.520]  And because nobody has to travel for these things,
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.960]  there's not that much reason to worry
[23:39.960 --> 23:43.560]  about giving people six days notice or seven days notice.
[23:43.560 --> 23:47.200]  And then the PR flow is,
[23:47.200 --> 23:50.360]  okay, today the WWDC announcement
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.680]  takes up all the Apple cycles
[23:52.680 --> 23:55.480]  and puts the date on the calendar,
[23:55.480 --> 23:57.360]  gets people talking about it.
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.000]  Then boom, the next day,
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.760]  hey, we have an event next week,
[24:00.760 --> 24:03.400]  some kind of clever slogan with, you know,
[24:03.400 --> 24:04.680]  I don't know which event,
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.720]  which product might be the one that gets the pun title,
[24:09.880 --> 24:12.320]  keeps people talking about that for six days
[24:12.320 --> 24:13.880]  and then the actual event happens
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.000]  and they release these things.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.280]  I could see that being the plan.
[24:18.280 --> 24:20.480]  And if it's not next week,
[24:20.480 --> 24:23.240]  then I would think it's definitely the week after that.
[24:23.240 --> 24:26.280]  I just feel like it's bursting at the seams at this point
[24:26.280 --> 24:28.040]  to release some of this stuff.
[24:28.040 --> 24:30.480]  Yeah, it feels like there's a bunch of products
[24:30.480 --> 24:32.360]  just at Apple Park that just keeps slamming
[24:32.360 --> 24:35.400]  against that door saying, let us out, let us out.
[24:35.400 --> 24:37.280]  Right, so what would you,
[24:37.280 --> 24:40.560]  I mean, do you agree that there's gotta be an April event?
[24:41.440 --> 24:43.200]  Yeah, I think anytime that,
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.200]  if it's just iterative update stuff,
[24:45.200 --> 24:47.920]  you know, like the Intel MacBook Air
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.080]  with the non-butterfly with the scissor key keyboard,
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.720]  that kind of stuff, they can drop in a press release,
[24:53.720 --> 24:54.600]  no problem.
[24:54.600 --> 24:55.920]  AirPods too, no problem.
[24:55.920 --> 24:57.240]  We know what AirPods are.
[24:57.240 --> 24:58.920]  But anytime they need to explain something,
[24:58.920 --> 25:01.720]  it really, really behooves them to have an event.
[25:01.720 --> 25:04.640]  And if there is anything significant about the iPad Pro,
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.280]  like some of the rumors suggest,
[25:06.280 --> 25:09.440]  or just if they do finally release AirTags,
[25:09.440 --> 25:12.120]  there are things that I would like Apple to get ahead of
[25:12.120 --> 25:14.320]  because I can just anticipate a whole bunch
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.360]  of really sensational headlines
[25:17.360 --> 25:19.720]  if Apple doesn't have a good story in place.
[25:19.720 --> 25:20.720]  They're gonna do it anyway,
[25:20.720 --> 25:23.520]  but I just think it'd be good for Apple
[25:23.520 --> 25:24.600]  to get ahead of these products
[25:24.600 --> 25:27.720]  and sort of present their case on stage for them.
[25:27.720 --> 25:29.240]  Yeah, any one of them,
[25:29.240 --> 25:31.280]  I mean, one good rule of thumb
[25:31.280 --> 25:33.720]  is even with the virtual events,
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.240]  Apple is keen not to waste our time
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.560]  and they're not going to have even a 45-minute event
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.320]  just to unveil new AirPods, right?
[25:44.320 --> 25:45.800]  And I don't think they would,
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.640]  they're not gonna hold an event just to have a 15-minute,
[25:49.640 --> 25:52.480]  they're not gonna do a 15-minute event, I don't think,
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.840]  which would, if it was like just AirPods,
[25:56.840 --> 25:58.360]  because what, you know.
[25:58.360 --> 25:59.640]  But on the other hand,
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.200]  if they're going to have a late March, early April episode
[26:04.200 --> 26:06.480]  of the Apple event show,
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.480]  and there are just new third-generation AirPods,
[26:11.600 --> 26:14.080]  well, let's give them five to 10 minutes
[26:14.080 --> 26:17.120]  and talk about what a success AirPods have been
[26:17.120 --> 26:19.800]  out in the world and how they're the number one,
[26:19.800 --> 26:22.840]  whatever way of phrasing it as the number one
[26:22.840 --> 26:25.400]  wireless AirPods in the world.
[26:27.120 --> 26:30.920]  And here's what's great about our most popular AirPods,
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.120]  the regular AirPods,
[26:32.120 --> 26:34.200]  and here's what's great about the new ones.
[26:35.120 --> 26:37.680]  You know, I would definitely give them time,
[26:37.680 --> 26:40.160]  if I were them, I would see them giving them time
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.280]  that they otherwise wouldn't get on their own
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.560]  if it was the only thing.
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.440]  My hope, my dream for this event would be the new iPad Pro,
[26:49.440 --> 26:51.360]  the new Apple TV and AirTags,
[26:51.360 --> 26:54.360]  because I am so ready for all three of those things.
[26:54.360 --> 26:56.560]  And if they have to sacrifice AirPods
[26:56.560 --> 26:58.960]  to like a press release or even a fall event
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.160]  to give me those things, I'll just sign me right up.
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.640]  I think that they're good though,
[27:02.640 --> 27:05.760]  especially with the online format
[27:05.760 --> 27:10.760]  where there's not as much boilerplate of,
[27:11.680 --> 27:14.400]  okay, we're on stage and now we're going to introduce,
[27:14.400 --> 27:17.040]  and not that those handoffs of,
[27:17.040 --> 27:19.960]  and now I'm going to call so-and-so out to tell you
[27:19.960 --> 27:22.960]  about blank, not that that takes a lot of time
[27:22.960 --> 27:24.480]  and they're always right in the wings
[27:24.480 --> 27:26.080]  and they're halfway out on the stage
[27:26.080 --> 27:27.240]  ready to take the clicker
[27:27.240 --> 27:29.720]  from whoever's handing it off to them,
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.040]  but it adds up, you know, in a way that you,
[27:33.040 --> 27:38.040]  they edit all of that out with the online show version.
[27:39.280 --> 27:43.360]  You know, so like HomePod Mini didn't take a lot of time
[27:43.360 --> 27:47.120]  in the whatever event that was where the HomePod Mini came up.
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.240]  Plus you get that cool bottle city of Kandor special effect
[27:50.240 --> 27:51.720]  when it was hiding behind him.
[27:51.720 --> 27:54.600]  Right, so I would say AirPods
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.160]  is probably the boringest thing, right?
[27:56.160 --> 27:57.200]  Because the idea would be,
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.560]  it's just a new version of the standard AirPods
[28:00.560 --> 28:02.320]  without noise cancellation,
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.240]  but with it supposedly with an industrial design
[28:05.240 --> 28:09.560]  that looks a lot like AirPods Pro, different ear shape.
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.640]  And I wonder if they'll still have the rubber tips,
[28:13.640 --> 28:15.360]  you know, if that will become standard
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.520]  with the sizable rubber tips, like the AirPods Pro.
[28:20.560 --> 28:23.440]  Is it a problem if they look indistinguishable
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.520]  from AirPods Pro?
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.200]  I think it's less the problem with the AirPods Pro.
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.360]  Some of the rumors had,
[28:28.360 --> 28:31.440]  like some of the leaked images had tips
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.360]  or looked like they could have tips or didn't have tips.
[28:34.360 --> 28:35.720]  So it seems like it's still up in the air,
[28:35.720 --> 28:38.000]  but a lot of people don't like, like they're,
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.440]  right now some people don't like the AirPod,
[28:40.440 --> 28:43.080]  the classic AirPods because they don't stay in their ear.
[28:43.080 --> 28:46.520]  So they get the AirPods Pro and they like the tips.
[28:46.520 --> 28:48.640]  Other people don't like having anything in their ear.
[28:48.640 --> 28:51.600]  It either bothers them or is actually painful for them.
[28:51.600 --> 28:52.880]  So they get the AirPods
[28:52.880 --> 28:55.080]  and they have that choice in products.
[28:55.080 --> 28:57.600]  So this looks like it's trying to be a middle ground
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.680]  and maybe the tips will even be optional,
[28:59.680 --> 29:00.520]  which would be great.
[29:00.520 --> 29:02.440]  You know, Apple's not famous for giving you options,
[29:02.440 --> 29:03.720]  but maybe they will be.
[29:03.720 --> 29:06.240]  But I hope at least the people who prefer not to have them
[29:06.240 --> 29:07.240]  still have an option.
[29:07.240 --> 29:09.960]  Yeah, my son has regular AirPods
[29:09.960 --> 29:12.720]  and has tried my AirPods Pro and claims to hate them.
[29:12.720 --> 29:16.120]  Like he hasn't warned them like long enough
[29:16.120 --> 29:18.080]  to really give him a chance, but he just,
[29:18.080 --> 29:20.040]  he just, he just like, ah,
[29:20.040 --> 29:22.440]  I don't like the feel of that in my ear, it doesn't want.
[29:22.440 --> 29:24.040]  So it's hard.
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.280]  It's hard to please everybody.
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.280]  I mean, putting things in your ear, just size alone,
[29:28.280 --> 29:30.040]  it's hard to get one size fits all.
[29:31.400 --> 29:32.240]  But-
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.080]  And that was a problem with the AirPods.
[29:33.080 --> 29:34.560]  Like it was like good for 80% of the people,
[29:34.560 --> 29:35.400]  but then 20% of the people,
[29:35.400 --> 29:37.760]  they just fell out all the time and that's not great either.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.600]  Yeah.
[29:40.000 --> 29:40.840]  What else?
[29:40.840 --> 29:43.240]  iPad, new iPad Pros.
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.200]  Let's go in reverse order of novelty, right?
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.040]  Okay.
[29:48.040 --> 29:52.720]  Cause I, I'm gonna say new iPad Pros
[29:52.720 --> 29:55.760]  seem like as close to a sure thing as possible
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.960]  because it's an important product for Apple.
[29:57.960 --> 30:00.880]  And like I said, last year's was just truly
[30:00.880 --> 30:03.360]  just a minor GPU speed bump.
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.360]  And the LiDAR camera, I always give poor LiDAR engineers,
[30:08.720 --> 30:09.840]  I don't really give you much.
[30:09.840 --> 30:13.280]  I just don't think people are using LiDAR cameras
[30:13.280 --> 30:16.160]  on their iPad very often, to be honest.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.640]  No, that always felt like a developer move.
[30:18.640 --> 30:20.320]  You get it out in people's hands earlier.
[30:20.320 --> 30:23.840]  Yeah, before the iPhone shipped with LiDAR.
[30:23.840 --> 30:25.640]  And maybe, you know, it would become a bigger deal
[30:25.640 --> 30:28.200]  for the iPad if the iPad, if the new iPad Pros
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.880]  use the LiDAR to help with low light autofocus
[30:31.880 --> 30:36.600]  the way that the iPhone 12 cameras do.
[30:36.600 --> 30:37.600]  Well, that was so weird.
[30:37.600 --> 30:39.640]  It's like the iPad came out with the LiDAR
[30:39.640 --> 30:41.680]  and they didn't hook it up to the camera app at all.
[30:41.680 --> 30:43.040]  Like if you, it was one of the most
[30:43.040 --> 30:44.780]  un-Apple like things I've ever encountered.
[30:44.780 --> 30:46.440]  If you press the portrait on button,
[30:46.440 --> 30:49.680]  it flipped the camera around into the TrueDepth camera,
[30:49.680 --> 30:51.560]  which is not intuitive at all.
[30:51.560 --> 30:53.200]  And I thought that they were just super busy
[30:53.200 --> 30:55.800]  and that we'd get it with iOS 14 in September
[30:55.800 --> 30:57.920]  when the iPhone got it and we still never got it.
[30:57.920 --> 31:00.360]  No, they never, they never had, there's some,
[31:00.360 --> 31:01.880]  either they don't want to do the work
[31:01.880 --> 31:05.400]  or there's something lacking in the hardware camera
[31:05.400 --> 31:07.560]  that prevents them from doing it up to,
[31:07.560 --> 31:10.120]  up to what they would view as useful.
[31:10.120 --> 31:13.280]  So I'm going to say it's overdue.
[31:13.280 --> 31:16.320]  So there was never an A13 generation iPad Pro.
[31:16.320 --> 31:20.640]  A14X seems like a likely bet.
[31:20.640 --> 31:21.920]  Yeah.
[31:21.920 --> 31:22.880]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[31:22.880 --> 31:25.480]  And I'm super fascinated because a lot of people,
[31:25.480 --> 31:26.900]  as soon as they saw the M1, they're like,
[31:26.900 --> 31:28.480]  we want that in an iPad.
[31:28.480 --> 31:30.480]  But the M1 was essentially an A14X
[31:30.480 --> 31:33.040]  with just a little bit of extra Mac specific IP,
[31:33.040 --> 31:35.200]  like the virtualization, the emulation,
[31:35.200 --> 31:37.520]  and the two Thunderbolt controllers.
[31:37.520 --> 31:39.260]  So that's basically what we're going to get
[31:39.260 --> 31:42.600]  in terms of just silicon power in the iPad Pro.
[31:42.600 --> 31:44.120]  One of the interesting rumors,
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.480]  and I made a little bit of hay out of it
[31:46.480 --> 31:50.000]  when I linked to Mark Gurman's post on the iPad Pros,
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.200]  was the, is the rumor that they might switch
[31:54.200 --> 31:56.600]  to mini LED screens.
[31:56.600 --> 31:58.960]  And according to the rumor mill,
[31:58.960 --> 32:03.960]  perhaps only in the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
[32:06.120 --> 32:08.520]  And that Apple, you know, the part I made hay over
[32:08.520 --> 32:11.200]  was two weeks ago describing it
[32:11.200 --> 32:13.500]  as something Apple was looking into.
[32:14.500 --> 32:16.380]  Yeah, and they were testing Thunderbolt two weeks ago.
[32:16.380 --> 32:19.120]  It's such odd language that Bloomberg uses.
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.400]  You're not testing something that's close to release.
[32:22.400 --> 32:25.280]  You know, this mini LED rumor has been out there
[32:25.280 --> 32:26.600]  for a while.
[32:27.880 --> 32:31.920]  The iPhones have, of course, switched to OLED.
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.840]  The iPad Pros still using
[32:37.840 --> 32:42.840]  ancient decrepit regular LCD technology,
[32:43.120 --> 32:45.280]  LED technology, what is it?
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.840]  Yeah, it's LCD with an LED backlight.
[32:46.840 --> 32:49.200]  Right, LCD with an LED backlight.
[32:49.200 --> 32:51.800]  They're still, they're great looking displays,
[32:51.800 --> 32:55.960]  but, you know, Apple moves fast on display technology.
[32:55.960 --> 32:59.280]  Mini LED is supposedly next.
[32:59.280 --> 33:04.280]  What is your understanding of why they would go
[33:04.480 --> 33:09.480]  OLED for phones, but mini LED for iPads?
[33:09.900 --> 33:14.160]  Like, why would there never be an OLED generation of iPads?
[33:14.160 --> 33:17.000]  So, I mean, there might, there's a couple things,
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.120]  like all of this stuff is kind of nerdy,
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.600]  but I think this audience really appreciates that.
[33:21.600 --> 33:25.340]  OLED is a terrific, but fundamentally flawed technology
[33:25.340 --> 33:27.160]  where you require a ton of mitigations,
[33:27.160 --> 33:28.960]  like you've got to mitigate against burn-in,
[33:28.960 --> 33:31.080]  off-axis color shifting.
[33:31.080 --> 33:32.660]  When you go to low brightness levels,
[33:32.660 --> 33:34.160]  you have pulse width modulation,
[33:34.160 --> 33:35.520]  which some people say they can see
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.560]  and gives them headaches or just bothers them in general.
[33:38.560 --> 33:42.340]  And OLED also didn't have the ability to do promotion
[33:42.340 --> 33:45.080]  until basically the end of last year,
[33:45.080 --> 33:47.880]  not in the quantities of devices that Apple shipped.
[33:47.880 --> 33:49.920]  Samsung managed to get them into a few devices,
[33:49.920 --> 33:52.500]  like the Fold 2 and the Galaxy Note.
[33:52.500 --> 33:55.580]  Those are very small-scale devices
[33:55.580 --> 33:57.700]  compared to iPhones and iPads.
[33:57.700 --> 34:02.200]  So they need basically the, what do they call it?
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.360]  You need a special kind of LTPO technology,
[34:05.360 --> 34:06.960]  the same the Apple Watch has,
[34:06.960 --> 34:09.880]  to be able to do the variable refresh rate.
[34:09.880 --> 34:10.920]  Because people will complain, they'll say,
[34:10.920 --> 34:15.000]  oh, like $3 Android phones have 120 hertz refresh,
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.280]  but not the iPhone.
[34:16.280 --> 34:18.680]  And it's just that Apple doesn't do high refresh.
[34:18.680 --> 34:20.740]  They do variable refresh rates
[34:20.740 --> 34:23.640]  all the way down to one on the Apple Watch,
[34:23.640 --> 34:26.760]  24 to 120 on the iPad.
[34:26.760 --> 34:30.160]  So they would lose promotion if they'd done OLED earlier.
[34:30.160 --> 34:33.120]  And also OLED has still had problems
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.280]  with the consistency of brightness on larger panels.
[34:37.280 --> 34:39.760]  Not like TV sets use totally different technologies
[34:39.760 --> 34:42.980]  than the phones and the iPads do.
[34:42.980 --> 34:45.040]  So Apple's been looking at micro LED,
[34:45.040 --> 34:46.440]  which is also completely different.
[34:46.440 --> 34:48.520]  That's like a more advanced version of OLED
[34:48.520 --> 34:50.820]  for the watch and probably the phone one day.
[34:50.820 --> 34:54.280]  But for everything that's LCD now, the Macs and the iPads,
[34:54.280 --> 34:57.920]  it gives you almost OLED levels of deep shadows,
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.240]  brightness, contrast ratio by using local dimming zones,
[35:04.240 --> 35:07.280]  which is what they showed off with the Pro Display XDR.
[35:07.280 --> 35:09.600]  So that basically you stop the leaking of the light
[35:09.600 --> 35:11.540]  into the larger part of the panel.
[35:11.540 --> 35:12.880]  So it gives you almost everything
[35:12.880 --> 35:15.520]  without all of the drawbacks that OLED has.
[35:15.520 --> 35:17.820]  And I wouldn't be surprised if they bifurcated it
[35:17.820 --> 35:19.560]  now that you can get LTPO OLED
[35:19.560 --> 35:23.080]  and maybe some iPads have OLED and some have mini LED,
[35:23.080 --> 35:24.120]  but it feels like mini LED
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.160]  is a better tablet solution right now.
[35:26.160 --> 35:28.680]  So there's mini LED and micro LED.
[35:29.520 --> 35:32.680]  Yeah, micro LED is self-illuminating like OLED is
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.400]  and mini LED is as a backlight.
[35:35.400 --> 35:36.840]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.840]  But it's interesting how bifurcated this has all become,
[35:42.760 --> 35:46.620]  where like when the iPad first came out,
[35:46.620 --> 35:49.320]  it just had the iPhone screen just bigger, right?
[35:49.320 --> 35:51.160]  And it was like the same pixels per inch
[35:51.160 --> 35:54.300]  and it was all similar technology and similar refresh rates.
[35:54.300 --> 35:58.040]  And now iPhones have OLED
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.560]  and OLED has certain characteristics that make that better.
[36:01.560 --> 36:04.480]  But iPads, which are using this older technology,
[36:04.480 --> 36:06.760]  have had ProMotion displays
[36:06.760 --> 36:10.000]  with higher variable refresh rates for years now.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.880]  iPhone has still never had that.
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.240]  Was a much anticipated maybe for last year's
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.000]  iPhones 12, I'll bet it's coming this year.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.560]  It felt like that was like one of the last tipping point.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.800]  Hmm, could we do it this year now?
[36:25.800 --> 36:27.260]  And now it'll come this year
[36:27.260 --> 36:29.600]  and there'll be variable refresh rates.
[36:29.600 --> 36:31.680]  Well, Samsung put it into the Galaxy S21
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.600]  and that's the big indicator
[36:32.600 --> 36:33.800]  because that's their popular phone,
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.680]  which means that they can produce it at capacity now.
[36:36.680 --> 36:38.680]  What else are we thinking about for iPad Pro?
[36:38.680 --> 36:40.200]  So the new displays and maybe,
[36:40.200 --> 36:43.320]  do you think they would do this with the big 13 inch model,
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.620]  get some more advanced display technology than the 11 inch?
[36:48.360 --> 36:49.600]  I would hope they keep it the same
[36:49.600 --> 36:51.520]  because like you, I'm a big proponent
[36:51.520 --> 36:52.880]  of just let me choose the size,
[36:52.880 --> 36:54.480]  but everything else identical
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.960]  and just let me choose the size.
[36:55.960 --> 36:58.920]  I don't wanna think I'm getting a lower class iPhone or iPad
[36:58.920 --> 37:01.200]  just because I'm getting a smaller one.
[37:01.200 --> 37:02.720]  But I think it also probably has to do,
[37:02.720 --> 37:03.960]  like they're looking,
[37:03.960 --> 37:06.200]  I just imagine Tim Cook has basically pivot tables
[37:06.200 --> 37:07.360]  in his head at this point.
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.840]  And they figure out everything in terms of price point
[37:09.840 --> 37:12.120]  and yield and what each component costs
[37:12.120 --> 37:13.880]  and what they can charge for the product.
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.600]  And then all those little number sheets in his head
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.840]  lock into what they can do for any given generation.
[37:19.840 --> 37:21.600]  Right, you would think technically it would be harder
[37:21.600 --> 37:23.400]  to do it in a bigger device,
[37:23.400 --> 37:25.920]  but on the other hand, the bigger ones sell for more money
[37:25.920 --> 37:26.760]  and so therefore,
[37:26.760 --> 37:28.840]  maybe it's not really an engineering problem,
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.840]  but just a component availability and profit margin issue.
[37:34.240 --> 37:37.200]  And it's also not intuitive sometimes,
[37:37.200 --> 37:38.740]  like a couple of years ago at CES,
[37:38.740 --> 37:41.420]  they were showing off the early minion micro LED TVs
[37:41.420 --> 37:44.360]  and they were enormous because the panel size,
[37:44.360 --> 37:46.520]  the pixels in the panels were still enormous.
[37:46.520 --> 37:48.460]  I hadn't been able to shrink them down yet.
[37:48.460 --> 37:49.800]  So you have all sorts of factors
[37:49.800 --> 37:52.400]  that always complicate these things.
[37:52.400 --> 37:55.040]  All right, yeah, I'd say it's a maybe.
[37:55.040 --> 37:57.000]  And it's one of those weird rumors
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.680]  where usually there's a little smoke, there's fire.
[37:59.680 --> 38:04.680]  It seems like the display stuff with Ming Chi Kuo
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.020]  is often one of the leakiest aspects
[38:10.020 --> 38:12.260]  of Apple's supply chain.
[38:12.260 --> 38:13.200]  I wouldn't bet against it.
[38:13.200 --> 38:16.100]  I hope not, but it also sounds like something
[38:16.100 --> 38:18.440]  that Apple definitely could do is say,
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.440]  only in the 12.9 inch, we have something even better.
[38:22.440 --> 38:24.400]  We've got this amazing display
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.880]  with these amazing characteristics.
[38:28.040 --> 38:29.440]  Yeah, and sometimes it just matters
[38:29.440 --> 38:30.440]  how much they can produce.
[38:30.440 --> 38:31.960]  Like maybe they can produce enough for one of them
[38:31.960 --> 38:34.600]  and not the other, or like you said, absorb the price
[38:34.600 --> 38:36.880]  in one of them but not the other.
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.360]  I've gotten a slew of emails
[38:41.480 --> 38:45.480]  and tweets from readers thinking
[38:45.480 --> 38:50.480]  that Apple might use the M1 chip in the iPad Pro
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.160]  and that it might also therefore dual boot into Mac OS
[38:55.160 --> 38:58.480]  and that this would be the solution
[38:58.480 --> 39:00.760]  to the one device meets all.
[39:00.760 --> 39:02.720]  And to that I say, no way.
[39:02.720 --> 39:07.600]  The M1, they couldn't, I don't know what the A stands for
[39:07.600 --> 39:09.160]  in the A series chips.
[39:09.160 --> 39:10.760]  Apple, maybe?
[39:10.760 --> 39:11.880]  Yeah, it was just Apple originally.
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.360]  Yeah, the M1, the M in M1 is for Mac
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.640]  and Macs are Macs and iPads are iPads.
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.220]  I would expect based on benchmark scores
[39:22.220 --> 39:25.960]  comparing the regular old A14 and the iPhone 12
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.960]  to the M1 Macs that the A14X,
[39:30.960 --> 39:33.560]  which is what I would anticipate the iPad Pro chip
[39:33.560 --> 39:37.600]  being named, would perform very similarly,
[39:37.600 --> 39:39.360]  benchmark-wise, to the M1s
[39:39.360 --> 39:40.620]  because it would probably have
[39:40.620 --> 39:43.480]  the extra high-performance cores
[39:44.560 --> 39:46.800]  and probably maybe clocked higher.
[39:46.800 --> 39:48.080]  But that doesn't make it,
[39:48.080 --> 39:50.600]  that's not the difference between the M1 and the A14.
[39:50.600 --> 39:53.240]  The M1 has a bunch of other stuff on the system on a chip
[39:53.240 --> 39:55.700]  that are specific to the needs of a Mac
[39:55.700 --> 39:58.600]  that wouldn't make sense for an iPad.
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.840]  So it's not like the A14X is gonna be slow.
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.000]  I think it would be crazy fast, just like the M1,
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.720]  but that's, the M1 is way more than that.
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.240]  And the dual boot idea, I really,
[40:10.240 --> 40:12.520]  for those of you hoping for it, I really,
[40:12.520 --> 40:14.200]  I just don't see it happening.
[40:14.200 --> 40:18.360]  It just seems like anathema to Apple's mindset
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.800]  of how these devices and the OS.
[40:21.800 --> 40:22.640]  Very toaster fridge-y.
[40:22.640 --> 40:24.840]  Yeah, yeah, and it just,
[40:24.840 --> 40:27.880]  there's just no separation conceptually from,
[40:28.840 --> 40:30.600]  I know in theory you could do it,
[40:30.600 --> 40:33.920]  but, and I know that the developer kits
[40:37.240 --> 40:40.020]  for the Apple Silicon Macs that the developers
[40:40.020 --> 40:43.800]  are just being politely told to hand back now
[40:43.800 --> 40:48.800]  were performance-wise very similar to iPad Pros.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.600]  But there's a reason why they didn't let you run Mac OS
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.360]  on an iPad Pro to develop your Mac apps, right?
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.100]  Which is what, also a year ago,
[40:57.100 --> 40:58.760]  what a lot of people were thinking,
[40:58.760 --> 41:00.100]  that there won't be developer kits.
[41:00.100 --> 41:03.600]  They'll just have a way to dual boot your iPad Pro
[41:03.600 --> 41:05.800]  into Mac OS, and that's how you'll develop.
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.240]  No, they're not gonna have Mac OS running on a touchscreen
[41:09.240 --> 41:11.860]  when Mac OS doesn't support touchscreens,
[41:11.860 --> 41:13.640]  even though you could, and then, you know,
[41:13.640 --> 41:15.480]  well, you could just use the Magic Keyboard
[41:15.480 --> 41:17.000]  and then you have a trackpad.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.760]  But it's like, that just isn't how Apple thinks about things.
[41:20.760 --> 41:23.320]  Yeah, and I think there's one circumstance
[41:23.320 --> 41:25.200]  where I can see them, so again,
[41:25.200 --> 41:26.260]  just for all intents and purposes,
[41:26.260 --> 41:29.100]  the A14X would be identical,
[41:29.100 --> 41:32.360]  just in terms of, like, it would have the same Ice Storm
[41:32.360 --> 41:34.960]  and Fire Storm efficiency and performance cores.
[41:34.960 --> 41:37.040]  And I'm gonna just register a protest here
[41:37.040 --> 41:39.880]  that the graphics and the neural engine cores
[41:39.880 --> 41:41.340]  don't get fancy code names,
[41:41.340 --> 41:45.240]  because ShaderCore and, sorry, ShaderStorm and BrainStorm
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.580]  seem like logical code names for those chips.
[41:48.580 --> 41:50.920]  So I can just treat all your cores equally.
[41:50.920 --> 41:53.440]  But they would be the same, like, literally the same chip.
[41:53.440 --> 41:54.780]  They might have frequency differences
[41:54.780 --> 41:57.720]  given the thermal envelopes of the boxes they're put in,
[41:57.720 --> 41:59.200]  but it's the same cores.
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.200]  Like, Apple right now has an A12 in the iPhone
[42:02.200 --> 42:03.960]  and an A12 in the iPad Air.
[42:03.960 --> 42:05.520]  It's the exact same silicon.
[42:05.520 --> 42:07.680]  The iPhone will hit the image signal processor more
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.240]  because people take and process photos more on their iPhones,
[42:11.240 --> 42:13.560]  and maybe the GPU gets hit harder in the iPad Air
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.720]  because people are using, you know, higher-level apps
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.920]  like Procreate, things that hit the GPU harder,
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.200]  but it's just efficient for them.
[42:20.200 --> 42:22.920]  That's their whole scalable architecture thing.
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.040]  It's why they don't become a silicon merchant
[42:26.040 --> 42:27.840]  for Apple being their, you know,
[42:27.840 --> 42:29.600]  a bunch of different products inside Apple
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.520]  is that everything from the watch to the Mac
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.600]  has the same sort of core architecture.
[42:35.600 --> 42:39.480]  So if it's cheaper for them to have M series,
[42:39.480 --> 42:41.560]  and to just, because the names of it,
[42:41.560 --> 42:42.840]  like, the chips are the same,
[42:42.840 --> 42:45.800]  if it's cheaper to have an M processor in an iPad,
[42:45.800 --> 42:47.320]  they call it A14X,
[42:47.320 --> 42:49.360]  turn off one of the Thunderbolt controllers,
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.640]  turn off the virtualization and the emulation circuits,
[42:53.640 --> 42:57.120]  maybe just it's economics that changes that.
[42:57.120 --> 42:58.200]  Otherwise, if it's cheaper
[42:58.200 --> 42:59.640]  to make a whole separate line of chips
[42:59.640 --> 43:01.800]  that don't include that to begin with,
[43:01.800 --> 43:02.640]  that's what they'll do,
[43:02.640 --> 43:04.920]  but there's no functional difference there.
[43:06.360 --> 43:08.680]  Yeah, that's what I anticipate.
[43:08.680 --> 43:10.080]  Anything else?
[43:10.920 --> 43:12.960]  I guess maybe it'll get a camera upgrade
[43:12.960 --> 43:15.120]  compared to the existing iPad Pros,
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.680]  because that's what happens.
[43:17.680 --> 43:20.200]  Otherwise, though, you know.
[43:20.200 --> 43:21.520]  I'd love to see Thunderbolt, though.
[43:21.520 --> 43:23.880]  I mean, now that they have Thunderbolt on the M1,
[43:23.880 --> 43:25.560]  and they could conceivably put on board
[43:25.560 --> 43:26.800]  a Thunderbolt controller,
[43:26.800 --> 43:29.800]  just because I have so many really fast storage drives now
[43:29.800 --> 43:31.600]  that don't work on the iPad Pro,
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.000]  and I'd love to be able to pull video and stuff onto there.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.880]  Well, and I think if they go USB 4,
[43:38.880 --> 43:40.400]  that includes Thunderbolt.
[43:40.400 --> 43:42.640]  And I know that, oh my God,
[43:42.640 --> 43:47.640]  the entire saga of USB-ish standards
[43:47.880 --> 43:51.040]  that use the plug that looks like,
[43:51.040 --> 43:52.720]  we all just look, see that plug,
[43:52.720 --> 43:55.400]  and we think, that's USB-C.
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.040]  And it's also Thunderbolt,
[43:57.040 --> 43:59.520]  but a Thunderbolt cable costs $200,
[44:01.040 --> 44:04.800]  and is thick and heavy and ray-shielded,
[44:04.800 --> 44:07.600]  and, you know.
[44:07.600 --> 44:11.080]  USB 4, supposedly,
[44:11.080 --> 44:13.840]  is the USB with that plug
[44:13.840 --> 44:17.080]  that works the way we,
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.480]  it obviously all should have worked all along,
[44:19.480 --> 44:22.960]  where everything is everything, you know.
[44:22.960 --> 44:25.920]  And so if you plug anything in that has that plug,
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.160]  it'll go at the fullest speed that it supports,
[44:29.160 --> 44:30.000]  including Thunderbolt.
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.360]  Yeah, it's the dream, right?
[44:31.360 --> 44:32.320]  Finally.
[44:32.320 --> 44:33.800]  Because right now, like you said,
[44:33.800 --> 44:35.360]  the USB-C, some of them have power,
[44:35.360 --> 44:36.720]  some don't, some support displays,
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.440]  some don't, some do.
[44:38.440 --> 44:40.880]  It's just a mess, and this hopefully will fix it.
[44:40.880 --> 44:42.480]  Right, especially if it's USB 4.
[44:42.480 --> 44:46.120]  And then that should be the most future-proof as well,
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.040]  and would be a very nice story.
[44:48.040 --> 44:50.040]  It would be, and you know,
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.040]  it would be a nice little feather in the iPad Pro's cap
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.560]  that it has USB 4 before the Mac, even.
[44:56.560 --> 44:58.000]  Let me think, yeah, that's a good one.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.520]  And it seems likely,
[44:59.520 --> 45:02.440]  and at the very least, Thunderbolt seems likely.
[45:02.440 --> 45:03.760]  I mean, and for some reason,
[45:03.760 --> 45:06.960]  the whole driving big Thunderbolt displays
[45:06.960 --> 45:09.080]  from an iPad Pro is a thing,
[45:09.080 --> 45:10.480]  and apparently people are using it.
[45:10.480 --> 45:13.920]  I don't know, I've never plugged anything like that in.
[45:13.920 --> 45:15.600]  Well, just like I have these Samsung drives
[45:15.600 --> 45:17.960]  that are almost like the MVNE drives,
[45:17.960 --> 45:19.760]  and they just don't work on the iPad Pro,
[45:19.760 --> 45:21.400]  and that's annoying.
[45:21.400 --> 45:23.720]  Just don't work at all, right.
[45:23.720 --> 45:26.960]  Right, and it definitely works against the,
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.120]  you know, and that's, not to get into the whole,
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.880]  is the iPhone ever gonna support a USB-C plug,
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.880]  to which I say, no, I really don't think so.
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.280]  I think it's lightning all the way
[45:37.280 --> 45:38.720]  until they go no plug at all.
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.760]  But their explanation, and the people who,
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.600]  for whatever reason, want the iPhone to go USB-C,
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.520]  and I totally get the, I'm not dismissing you,
[45:49.520 --> 45:50.800]  but I totally get the idea
[45:50.800 --> 45:52.960]  that then you only have one type of plug type
[45:52.960 --> 45:55.240]  laying around your house to charge everything,
[45:55.240 --> 45:56.840]  you know, but then the Apple Watch chargers
[45:56.840 --> 45:58.360]  would all have to go USB-C too,
[45:58.360 --> 46:00.840]  and you know, it's not that easy.
[46:00.840 --> 46:01.680]  No.
[46:01.680 --> 46:03.960]  But Apple's original explanation
[46:03.960 --> 46:07.440]  for when the iPad Pro first switched from lightning to USB-C
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.720]  was we want to enable pro workflows
[46:10.720 --> 46:13.520]  that would otherwise require a Mac.
[46:14.440 --> 46:16.280]  I forget how they phrased it exactly,
[46:16.280 --> 46:18.800]  but more or less, things you used to have to use
[46:18.800 --> 46:21.800]  a Mac or PC for, they wanted the iPad Pro to do,
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.160]  and that meant USB-C, and the best USB-C was USB-C,
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.440]  so they have USB-C, so that you can plug USB peripherals
[46:29.440 --> 46:32.120]  into your iPad Pro for professional workflows.
[46:32.120 --> 46:35.040]  And that's not really a thing for phones.
[46:35.040 --> 46:37.480]  People aren't, you know, Apple doesn't sell the iPhone
[46:37.480 --> 46:39.960]  as a thing that you can plug PC peripherals
[46:39.960 --> 46:44.120]  like Samsung Thunderbolt drives into your iPhone.
[46:44.120 --> 46:46.640]  In theory, it could, but again, in theory,
[46:46.640 --> 46:49.760]  they could, you know, make the iPhone dual-boot macOS,
[46:49.760 --> 46:51.000]  you know, they're not gonna do it.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.160]  Yeah, I think the thing for me is that, like,
[46:54.160 --> 46:55.320]  Apple built all these things,
[46:55.320 --> 46:57.560]  like they contributed hugely towards USB-C,
[46:57.560 --> 46:58.840]  and they knew the timelines,
[46:58.840 --> 47:00.240]  and they wanted to make the iPhone 5,
[47:00.240 --> 47:02.760]  and USB-C just wasn't gonna be ready for years,
[47:02.760 --> 47:03.760]  and so they made lightning
[47:03.760 --> 47:05.840]  because they don't have to worry about the USB,
[47:05.840 --> 47:08.280]  like the USB consortium for that.
[47:08.280 --> 47:09.320]  And then you just can't ask people
[47:09.320 --> 47:10.600]  to change connectors that often.
[47:10.600 --> 47:12.960]  When they changed from the dock to lightning,
[47:12.960 --> 47:15.000]  people were super angry, they had to get new cables
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.920]  and everything for it.
[47:16.920 --> 47:18.960]  So you can maybe get away with that on a product
[47:18.960 --> 47:21.080]  like with Apple products once a decade.
[47:21.080 --> 47:23.520]  And so there was no point in going to USB-C.
[47:23.520 --> 47:26.240]  And now I feel like lightning is a bottleneck,
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.560]  like it's still at, mostly it's still at USB 2.1 speeds.
[47:29.560 --> 47:31.000]  It's not really great for anything.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.600]  It's more waterproof than USB-C,
[47:32.600 --> 47:34.640]  it's slightly smaller than USB-C,
[47:34.640 --> 47:35.560]  but all of that things,
[47:35.560 --> 47:38.200]  it just feels like it's approaching end of life.
[47:38.200 --> 47:40.560]  And is there USB-C in the future?
[47:40.560 --> 47:42.360]  Will they make a new mini USB-C
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.400]  with what's the point when they could just use MagSafe
[47:45.400 --> 47:48.920]  and the U1 chip to do wireless charging and data?
[47:51.720 --> 47:54.520]  The big problem with only going wireless for charging
[47:54.520 --> 47:57.200]  is that the highest speed isn't anywhere near as fast
[47:57.200 --> 47:59.600]  as the highest speed you can get through a plug.
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.640]  It's fast now though.
[48:00.640 --> 48:02.760]  Like if you look at some of the Android vendors
[48:02.760 --> 48:04.800]  are not only using faster charges,
[48:04.800 --> 48:06.120]  but they're segmenting the battery
[48:06.120 --> 48:08.040]  so you can charge them in parallel.
[48:08.040 --> 48:10.120]  Right, so I wouldn't be surprised
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.800]  if that's Apple's long-term plan,
[48:11.800 --> 48:15.600]  that they've got stuff on the whiteboard down the hall,
[48:15.600 --> 48:16.920]  like at the end of the hallway
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.760]  where people are working on things two to three years out
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.800]  as opposed to things shipping this year,
[48:21.800 --> 48:25.040]  they've got plans for getting wireless,
[48:25.040 --> 48:26.400]  I can't believe I just said wireless,
[48:26.400 --> 48:31.400]  but magnetic inductive charging working at higher speeds.
[48:31.560 --> 48:33.240]  And then someone else down the hall
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.360]  is working on actual wireless charging
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.760]  where you can charge at a distance
[48:37.760 --> 48:40.680]  from a device truly over the air.
[48:40.680 --> 48:42.720]  Like that refrigerator that they were showing off in China
[48:42.720 --> 48:43.920]  where you just walk around your living room
[48:43.920 --> 48:45.480]  and it trickle charges you.
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.200]  Anything else for iPad?
[48:48.200 --> 48:50.720]  I would take USB-C and an iPhone Pro though.
[48:50.720 --> 48:51.720]  I mean, I would take it anyway
[48:51.720 --> 48:54.040]  just because like if you're giving me a Pro device,
[48:54.040 --> 48:56.400]  like let consumers have all the inductive stuff,
[48:56.400 --> 48:57.560]  but if you're giving me a Pro device
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.120]  and you're gonna go to 8K for video
[48:59.120 --> 49:01.600]  and all these things eventually, I just want that speed.
[49:01.600 --> 49:03.120]  I want the speed to be able to take stuff
[49:03.120 --> 49:04.400]  on and off that thing.
[49:04.400 --> 49:07.320]  It's possible, and maybe Pro would be the way they do it.
[49:07.320 --> 49:09.120]  I just think that it's one of those things
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.640]  where the nerd part of the population cannot believe
[49:13.640 --> 49:17.440]  how the vast majority of non-nerds think about things.
[49:17.440 --> 49:22.040]  And one of my favorite examples is the old five watt charger
[49:23.160 --> 49:25.720]  and how many people preferred that charger
[49:25.720 --> 49:27.000]  because it was small.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.960]  And you could keep it in your purse and it's lightweight
[49:29.960 --> 49:33.520]  or you could plug it in to plugs
[49:33.520 --> 49:35.080]  that were full of other plugs.
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.120]  And if there was an open socket,
[49:37.120 --> 49:38.880]  there was room for that plug.
[49:38.880 --> 49:40.120]  And that they don't really care
[49:40.120 --> 49:41.720]  that it's not the highest speed.
[49:41.720 --> 49:44.440]  They just, they really appreciate the size.
[49:44.440 --> 49:47.000]  And it really wasn't until Apple could,
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  and again, could in theory make a higher capacity charger
[49:52.760 --> 49:56.200]  at a smaller size, sure, but do it at their scale
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.240]  and at the cost they wanted to hit for the price
[49:59.240 --> 50:00.120]  at a smaller size.
[50:00.120 --> 50:01.760]  They really kind of needed to wait for that.
[50:01.760 --> 50:04.200]  And the size issue never came up.
[50:04.200 --> 50:05.840]  All the, in the nerd press,
[50:05.840 --> 50:09.480]  all they wanted to talk about was five watt is slow
[50:09.480 --> 50:11.320]  and iPhones are expensive.
[50:11.320 --> 50:12.720]  It's a rip off that it doesn't come
[50:12.720 --> 50:13.880]  with a high speed charger,
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.400]  but it's like, people don't want that.
[50:16.400 --> 50:17.600]  A lot of that was nonsense too.
[50:17.600 --> 50:19.560]  Like when you, there's levels of nerds
[50:19.560 --> 50:21.040]  and there's nothing more dangerous
[50:21.040 --> 50:22.360]  than like a half informed nerd.
[50:22.360 --> 50:23.640]  And I mean that lovingly
[50:23.640 --> 50:24.800]  because when you actually look at it,
[50:24.800 --> 50:27.600]  it's the same thing as 5G and all of these technologies.
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.440]  When you looked at them,
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.240]  they would peak charge at those wattage,
[50:31.240 --> 50:33.640]  but they wouldn't sustain charge at that.
[50:33.640 --> 50:34.840]  They would like give you a few seconds,
[50:34.840 --> 50:36.640]  but if you actually started measuring the current,
[50:36.640 --> 50:38.680]  it was nowhere near there and they were proprietary.
[50:38.680 --> 50:40.880]  So if you lost whatever dongle you couldn't,
[50:40.880 --> 50:42.640]  like you couldn't just plug it into anything else,
[50:42.640 --> 50:44.080]  you wouldn't get anywhere near those.
[50:44.080 --> 50:45.880]  The whole thing was really cockamamie
[50:45.880 --> 50:47.760]  and yet it was such good marketing
[50:47.760 --> 50:51.440]  and such spec bait for a whole segment of the community.
[50:52.280 --> 50:54.920]  So I think the same thing is true of connectors.
[50:54.920 --> 50:58.900]  I can't believe that the nerds don't remember
[50:58.900 --> 51:01.680]  all the non nerds in their life complaining
[51:01.680 --> 51:04.480]  so vociferously when Apple switched to lightning
[51:04.480 --> 51:05.920]  from the old 30 pin connectors,
[51:05.920 --> 51:08.680]  even though when you now look back at the 30 pin connectors,
[51:08.680 --> 51:10.520]  they look ridiculous.
[51:10.520 --> 51:12.120]  Every alarm clock in every hotel room
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.960]  for like what, eight years?
[51:13.960 --> 51:18.960]  They're so big and so weird looking, right?
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.020]  Because they exposed so much of the metal.
[51:22.020 --> 51:24.640]  It was such a weird looking plug.
[51:24.640 --> 51:27.120]  It's kind of hard to believe it was Apple's plug
[51:27.120 --> 51:30.060]  and you really have to go back 20 years ago
[51:30.060 --> 51:33.760]  to the early iPod era when they first switched away
[51:33.760 --> 51:37.680]  from FireWire to really appreciate
[51:37.680 --> 51:40.640]  how novel that adapter was.
[51:40.640 --> 51:43.500]  But it's not Apple's finest adapter design work.
[51:43.500 --> 51:44.340]  It's just exposed bits.
[51:44.340 --> 51:45.980]  And they had to keep re-switching the pins, remember?
[51:45.980 --> 51:48.640]  Because they had to switch something to HDMI
[51:48.640 --> 51:50.040]  and then they had to cross it again.
[51:50.040 --> 51:51.280]  It was just a mess.
[51:51.280 --> 51:53.520]  But when they switched to lightning,
[51:53.520 --> 51:55.760]  which in hindsight seems well, of course, obvious.
[51:55.760 --> 51:57.560]  Look how small and elegant it is.
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.120]  People went bananas on the theory
[52:00.120 --> 52:02.080]  that this was just a money grab
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.720]  and that they switched the plug just to get everybody
[52:04.720 --> 52:07.960]  to spend 20 more bucks to replace all the cables
[52:07.960 --> 52:09.320]  around their house.
[52:09.320 --> 52:11.080]  And if they switched to USB-C,
[52:11.080 --> 52:13.040]  and again, you could say, well, that's the open standard.
[52:13.040 --> 52:15.800]  It's like people would still say it was a money grab
[52:15.800 --> 52:20.760]  and they're mad because there are husbands and wives
[52:20.760 --> 52:24.120]  where one gets a new phone on the even years,
[52:24.120 --> 52:26.540]  the other gets the phone on the odd years.
[52:26.540 --> 52:27.700]  And what do you do for the year
[52:27.700 --> 52:29.800]  where they don't have the same plug on their phone
[52:29.800 --> 52:32.120]  and they want to have one plug in the kitchen?
[52:32.120 --> 52:34.480]  It's like, that's a common scenario.
[52:34.480 --> 52:37.220]  Just look at last year when Apple switched to a USB-C cable.
[52:37.220 --> 52:39.120]  People got super angry saying,
[52:39.120 --> 52:42.240]  we all have these USB-A connectors.
[52:42.240 --> 52:44.680]  Most people with an iPhone have a PC, not a Mac,
[52:44.680 --> 52:47.000]  and they have USB-A ports on them.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.480]  And Apple's clear message was, we know,
[52:49.480 --> 52:51.080]  but we figure if you have the old connector,
[52:51.080 --> 52:52.280]  you have the old cable.
[52:52.280 --> 52:54.920]  What we're worried about is you not having a USB-C cable
[52:54.920 --> 52:56.200]  if you have that connector.
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.360]  So we're giving you one with it.
[52:57.360 --> 53:00.160]  And they were like, no, this is outrageous.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.960]  I'm not saying they won't do it.
[53:01.960 --> 53:03.440]  And there are good reasons for it.
[53:03.440 --> 53:05.600]  And I know some people would celebrate a change.
[53:05.600 --> 53:08.880]  And the idea that maybe they would do it for the pros
[53:08.880 --> 53:12.560]  and not the regular iPhone 13s, I could see it.
[53:12.560 --> 53:14.400]  Because then they could pitch it
[53:14.400 --> 53:16.360]  as this is for our pro customers
[53:16.360 --> 53:18.960]  who are connecting these pro utilities.
[53:18.960 --> 53:21.780]  They're using raw, they're using Dolby Vision,
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.420]  they're doing AK, whatever video.
[53:24.420 --> 53:26.240]  We're giving you a connector for all that.
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.760]  But on the other hand, I think there's a huge security
[53:30.840 --> 53:33.280]  aspect to their desire to go portless.
[53:33.280 --> 53:36.040]  Because there still are, you still see some reports
[53:36.040 --> 53:40.360]  that like those, what are those gray whatever boxes?
[53:40.360 --> 53:41.960]  Yeah, and also the Juice Jack attacks
[53:41.960 --> 53:44.800]  where they just put it over the firmware in a USB-C cable.
[53:44.800 --> 53:48.840]  Right, that a bunch of the ways that iPhones get hacked
[53:48.840 --> 53:52.480]  by the companies that sell these boxes to law enforcement,
[53:52.480 --> 53:55.400]  supposedly only to law enforcement,
[53:55.400 --> 53:58.120]  that these things go over, yeah, celebrate.
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.040]  And they go over USB.
[54:00.040 --> 54:02.960]  And it's like, however, you can say,
[54:02.960 --> 54:04.620]  well, fix all your USB bugs.
[54:04.620 --> 54:07.200]  Well, one way to fix all your USB and Lightning bugs
[54:07.200 --> 54:09.440]  is to just get rid of USB and Lightning.
[54:10.920 --> 54:13.000]  Just take it out of the OS even, right?
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.840]  You don't even need it if you don't have the port.
[54:15.840 --> 54:20.840]  That's one way to nip all those bugs in the bud.
[54:21.640 --> 54:22.600]  And then if you have CarPlay,
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.740]  they'll just make a dongle for you.
[54:23.740 --> 54:28.240]  It'll be USB to wireless or whatever Apple standard uses
[54:28.240 --> 54:30.160]  for wireless, it'll be fine.
[54:30.160 --> 54:32.680]  Yeah, don't underestimate their ability
[54:32.680 --> 54:33.960]  to make a dongle for you.
[54:33.960 --> 54:37.480]  Yes, dongle, again, I keep ranting about stuff,
[54:37.480 --> 54:39.600]  but like if you're pros, you're just so used to that
[54:39.600 --> 54:42.480]  because you had FireWire 400 dongles, FireWire 800,
[54:42.480 --> 54:45.480]  you have mini DVI, regular DVI display port,
[54:45.480 --> 54:46.600]  you've had all the dongles.
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.640]  We've never lived a dongle-free life.
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.200]  No, just scuzzy things that used to screw in the back.
[54:52.200 --> 54:53.040]  All right, what's next?
[54:53.040 --> 54:55.040]  Let's do one more and then we'll take a break.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.380]  Do you wanna do Apple TV next?
[54:56.380 --> 54:57.880]  Because I'm waiting on that.
[54:57.880 --> 54:59.480]  All right, let's do Apple TV.
[55:00.600 --> 55:02.840]  This is one, I don't, what do you think?
[55:02.840 --> 55:05.480]  You think that there's new Apple TV hardware?
[55:05.480 --> 55:07.640]  I think so, because there's rumors of a new,
[55:07.640 --> 55:08.920]  I don't wanna call it a Siri remote anymore,
[55:08.920 --> 55:10.760]  I don't know if it's gonna be Siri optimized,
[55:10.760 --> 55:13.240]  but there's just, there's two sets of rumors.
[55:13.240 --> 55:16.320]  One, that it gets an A12X or an A12Z,
[55:16.320 --> 55:18.500]  and it just does HDR compositing better
[55:18.500 --> 55:20.200]  and plays Apple Arcade games better,
[55:20.200 --> 55:21.920]  and it's just a spec bump.
[55:21.920 --> 55:23.480]  And there's this other set of rumors
[55:23.480 --> 55:26.080]  that it's gonna get an A14X,
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.200]  which is odd to me because that's more expensive.
[55:29.200 --> 55:31.300]  It's still not as good in terms of GPU
[55:31.300 --> 55:34.120]  as an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5,
[55:34.120 --> 55:36.960]  but it would let Apple do a higher level of games,
[55:36.960 --> 55:40.720]  which, despite Apple showing very little interest
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.120]  in high order gaming, making all the money
[55:43.120 --> 55:45.400]  on casual gaming, people still have this fantasy
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.080]  of an Apple, like a more premium Apple gaming
[55:50.080 --> 55:53.600]  experience device, and so that's the other way
[55:53.600 --> 55:55.000]  that they could go.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.600]  Yeah, and I know that there have been
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.800]  somebody's spelunking around,
[55:59.800 --> 56:02.240]  I don't know if it was Guillermo Rambo or who,
[56:02.240 --> 56:04.400]  but somebody was spelunking around the latest
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.800]  iOS 14.5 beta and found the strings
[56:07.800 --> 56:10.920]  that you're referencing, that there's strings
[56:10.920 --> 56:13.880]  in the source code that reference a new remote
[56:13.880 --> 56:15.820]  and maybe have a hint of something.
[56:15.820 --> 56:20.820]  So I so want them to release a new Apple TV box
[56:23.960 --> 56:26.400]  just as a clear sign that they're still committed
[56:26.400 --> 56:30.780]  to having an Apple TV box, that I don't even care
[56:30.780 --> 56:33.360]  what the details are so much.
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.800]  My number one thought is, well, at least they're not
[56:35.800 --> 56:37.000]  getting away from it, because I do,
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.940]  I know I've talked about it in the last few episodes,
[56:38.940 --> 56:40.580]  I don't have to rehash it all here,
[56:40.580 --> 56:43.520]  but the fact that they're so all in on getting
[56:43.520 --> 56:46.640]  the Apple TV app for TV Plus content,
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.640]  built into TVs and other companies' boxes and dongles,
[56:52.060 --> 56:55.320]  is, you could just say, well, it's a dual strategy.
[56:55.320 --> 56:58.240]  They have their own box and they also want
[56:58.240 --> 57:03.240]  Apple TV Plus everywhere, but if the Apple TV box
[57:05.380 --> 57:07.700]  just fades away and doesn't get updated
[57:07.700 --> 57:10.580]  and eventually gets one of those sad Friday night
[57:10.580 --> 57:15.160]  Matthew Panzert stories at TechCrunch that, you know,
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.360]  it's while supplies last, right?
[57:18.360 --> 57:23.260]  Everybody will, well, he's so, he's great at it, though.
[57:23.260 --> 57:27.380]  Yes, but he's like the last rights for every Apple product.
[57:27.380 --> 57:30.080]  Right, but it's like, you know, like when they discontinued
[57:30.080 --> 57:33.160]  HomePod, it's exactly like this.
[57:33.160 --> 57:36.480]  I was disappointed, because I like HomePods
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.240]  better than most people do, but that's because
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.760]  I believe that the true HomePod experience
[57:42.760 --> 57:46.680]  is two of them as a $700 product and that, you know,
[57:46.680 --> 57:48.920]  that's more money than people wanted to spend.
[57:48.920 --> 57:51.380]  They didn't make the pitch, but when they discontinued it,
[57:51.380 --> 57:52.760]  nobody was like shocked.
[57:52.760 --> 57:54.920]  It wasn't like, oh my God, I can't believe it.
[57:54.920 --> 57:56.360]  It was sort of like, well, yeah,
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.720]  it didn't seem to be selling very well,
[57:58.720 --> 58:01.140]  and if they did that with Apple TV,
[58:02.260 --> 58:04.160]  everybody would be like, yeah, well,
[58:04.160 --> 58:05.680]  it didn't seem like it was selling that well,
[58:05.680 --> 58:08.300]  and they just spent the last 18 months
[58:08.300 --> 58:12.280]  in this major push with rival companies
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.840]  like Samsung and Google to get Apple TV
[58:16.840 --> 58:17.920]  onto all those boxes.
[58:17.920 --> 58:19.460]  What did you think that meant?
[58:19.460 --> 58:21.460]  There's a poor SOB somewhere in Cupertino
[58:21.460 --> 58:23.400]  whose only job it is is to make a Tizen port
[58:23.400 --> 58:26.160]  of the TV app, and I feel so bad for them.
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.160]  I, you know, so I would be happy,
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.440]  just, you have me at new Apple TV, right?
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.280]  You've got me.
[58:36.280 --> 58:38.580]  With a U1 chip and the controller
[58:38.580 --> 58:41.340]  so you can find it when it's in the sofa cushions.
[58:41.340 --> 58:42.980]  Right, oh, that would be great.
[58:44.840 --> 58:47.940]  Maybe something spatially oriented
[58:47.940 --> 58:51.340]  so that they can do the spatial audio.
[58:51.340 --> 58:53.660]  I would hope that that's part of it, right?
[58:53.660 --> 58:56.620]  Because the problem, I've written about this,
[58:56.620 --> 58:58.380]  I think most extensively when I was writing
[58:58.380 --> 59:02.700]  about the AirPods Max with this cool spatial audio feature
[59:02.700 --> 59:05.460]  where you can watch Dolby surround movies
[59:05.460 --> 59:10.460]  and get extraordinarily uncanny spatial audio.
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.060]  It's not just left, right.
[59:15.060 --> 59:17.740]  It really is truly directional.
[59:18.580 --> 59:19.780]  Yeah, if people aren't familiar with that,
[59:19.780 --> 59:21.320]  like if you're in a room with speakers
[59:21.320 --> 59:23.420]  and you walk around, the speakers don't move with you.
[59:23.420 --> 59:24.620]  They stay in the same place.
[59:24.620 --> 59:26.020]  But if you're wearing headphones,
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.460]  the headphones move around with you
[59:27.460 --> 59:30.700]  and spatial audio basically treats headphones like speakers.
[59:30.700 --> 59:32.180]  So it doesn't matter where you're walking.
[59:32.180 --> 59:33.680]  The audio stays in place
[59:33.680 --> 59:35.100]  as if you were listening to speakers.
[59:35.100 --> 59:36.580]  Or when you turn your head, right?
[59:36.580 --> 59:39.660]  You turn your head a little bit and you get this.
[59:39.660 --> 59:44.460]  It is both uncanny and, to me, very pleasant.
[59:44.460 --> 59:47.580]  I enjoy it very much.
[59:47.580 --> 59:50.260]  It's a little crazy, though, that it only works
[59:50.260 --> 59:54.300]  when you're watching a movie on an iPad or an iPhone.
[59:54.300 --> 59:56.300]  I mean, if you're on an airplane, that's great
[59:56.300 --> 59:59.380]  because that's where I would be watching the movie,
[59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.300]  but I tend to watch movies on TV.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.500]  Now, I don't have a baby in the house or anything like that
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.020]  where I need to listen to headphones while I watch movies,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.980]  but I have a while ago.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.140]  And I remember, and there's all sorts
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.180]  of other domestic situations
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.260]  where you might wanna watch on a big screen
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.300]  but use headphones to avoid disturbing somebody else.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.860]  And if that's the case, man,
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.860]  the best thing would be AirPods Max with spatial audio.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.080]  But it doesn't work.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.500]  Even though Apple TV is a $200 product,
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.540]  because Apple TV doesn't have any kind of spatial chip
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.700]  that would let you orient it.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.220]  And you can't just assume that the Apple TV
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.900]  is centered under the television
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.060]  because how do the headphones even know
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.160]  where the center of the television is?
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.700]  That would be cool.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.540]  I would hope so.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.700]  I would hope that would be part of it
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.840]  because I think the spatial audio is a thing
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.420]  that they should put into everything they can.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.980]  Some kind of beeper U1 thing in the remote
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.520]  would be fantastic.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.940]  Also, once you get the spatial audio,
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.860]  there's a HomePod mini,
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.060]  but let's assume there's gonna be
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.060]  a next generation HomePod with a U1.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.540]  You could theoretically just throw speakers
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.940]  in a room anywhere and they would all know
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.700]  where they are and where the TV is
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.180]  and just give you instant atmos everywhere,
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.660]  which I would love.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.980]  Right, right, and just give you
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.220]  this rich spatial experience just from the HomePods.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.200]  Don't even tease me.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.140]  Don't tease me with a new design for the remote.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.700]  I don't even wanna go there.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.960]  Boy, that would be a pleasant surprise.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.980]  If the only feature on the remote
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.980]  were a U1 chip for making it beep
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.000]  when it's in the couch, that would be pretty good.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.780]  You hold up your new iPad and it shows you
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.140]  where it is under the pillow.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.420]  I'm there.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.060]  I mean, putting aside the idea of making it
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.300]  an actual good game controller,
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.260]  which again, I think would be ideal,
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.100]  and something-
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.380]  There's like an Apple game controller as well,
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.060]  an additional, and I'd love to see Apple
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.340]  design a game controller and I'd love
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.540]  to see John Siracusa review the Apple game controller.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.860]  That would be good.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.260]  I think that the Nintendo Switch shows
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.180]  that you can make a credible game controller
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.460]  in a very tidy, tight size,
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.060]  because you can take the sides off a Switch
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.140]  and play with just one of them
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.860]  as an individual game controller,
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.260]  and it's not great, it's not the greatest thing,
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.940]  but it's good enough.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.180]  I've enjoyed it, especially playing
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.900]  with three or four people playing Mario Kart.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.060]  You don't have enough pro controllers to go around.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.500]  Just give one of these to everybody
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500]  and it's good enough.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.420]  And Super Smash Brothers is so confusing.
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.820]  It doesn't matter what controller you give me.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.340]  I can't keep up and I'm falling off
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.140]  the stage all the time anyway.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.580]  So anyway, that would be great if it came.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.660]  Are we getting ahead of ourselves, though?
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.260]  Is this too many products for one April event?
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.500]  Yeah, this is fanfic at this point,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.340]  but I'm in for it.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.340]  I'm down for it.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.540]  Well, I don't know.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.700]  It would be great.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.820]  It would be a weight off my shoulders
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.140]  if they had Apple TV next week.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.940]  There certainly is the potential, right?
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.340]  In terms of all of these products,
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.860]  which one needs an update?
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.780]  That would be one.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.860]  I feel like this A12 something
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.260]  versus A14 something discussion,
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.540]  if it's the A12 something, boy,
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.900]  it would be nice if they reduced the price of Apple TV.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.460]  And I know it's like my favorite segment
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.300]  of the talk show is spend Tim Cook's money
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.900]  and tell Tim Cook how to make things lower priced
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.380]  and make less money on a product.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.020]  More for less, yep.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:33.340]  But the price tag of Apple TV is, to me,
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.460]  very similar to the full-size HomePods.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.340]  The price tag alone is clearly keeping
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.660]  many, many people from even considering it.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.420]  They go in and they look and if they're in the market
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:50.180]  for a box to hook up to their HDMI port on their TV
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.020]  and the Roku's are 50 bucks
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.140]  and the Apple TV's are 170 bucks,
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.460]  they just go back to looking at the Roku's
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.260]  and the Amazon's and the other ones
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.340]  and they just don't really consider it.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.500]  And whether they should or not,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.300]  I think there's an argument that they should.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.940]  I love my Apple TV, but Apple has had years now
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.820]  and has not made the compelling case
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.020]  for why it's worth it to spend that much money on it.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.620]  And given how many years old Apple TV 4K is
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.940]  and hasn't been reduced in price,
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.020]  it just isn't that compelling technically anymore.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.860]  I mean, it's really-
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.100]  It's the same year as the iPhone X, right?
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.700]  The same event as the iPhone X.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.220]  Yeah, and it just is, I know from talking to some friends
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.900]  who are game developers, it's a challenge to get
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.860]  and maintain 30 frames per second
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.540]  on the current Apple TV 4K at 4K, right?
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.500]  And that's one of the things like for Apple Arcade,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.420]  if you're playing, if you're a game
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.900]  and you're running on Apple TV 4K,
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.340]  you need to be able to play at 4K.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.420]  You can't just switch to 1080,
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.580]  which for games is actually reasonable
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.420]  that even if you're hooked up to a 4K TV,
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.700]  it'd be better to be running at 1080
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.420]  at 30 plus frames per second
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.340]  than running at 4K under 30 frames per second.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.540]  Frames per second is more important than the resolution
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.860]  and in a game, there's motion blur
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.220]  and stuff's moving around
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.700]  but them's the rules and it's a challenge.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.700]  It's really hard technically for a lot of modern iOS games
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.580]  to get 30 frames per second at 4K on Apple TV hardware.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.300]  So if it's A12 though, I kind of hope it goes
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.980]  with a price cut and then if it's an A14,
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.220]  it's oh, this is why they kept the prices as high
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.500]  and never dropped the price
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.220]  and it's still selling them at $180
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:45.420]  because they plan to go all in with their best chip
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.260]  in an Apple TV and really make a play
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:52.060]  for selling this as a good computer,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.100]  a good game system, whatever else to hook up to your TV.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.380]  And it's such a, it was such,
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.460]  when the Apple TV 4K finally came out,
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.980]  I know there was just a bunch of stuff going on
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.260]  with like trying to decide, should it be a media box?
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.060]  Should it be a higher end premium console?
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.900]  What should the pricing be?
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.740]  And then they had a bunch
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.140]  of really interested game developers
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.020]  when the future of apps were apps
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.860]  who because of the market of the iPhone,
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.100]  they were really eager to see if they could do that again
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.620]  on the Apple TV and then at the last minute,
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.140]  they said, no, you have to use the Siri remote
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.860]  and you have to use on-demand resources
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.060]  and they're just like, okay, we're gonna wait and see then
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.780]  and there was never anything for them to see.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.980]  It didn't take off.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980]  So I just hope that if they're gonna go with that
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.220]  as their strategy, they do a holistic strategy
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.980]  and it's less about conforming to what Apple wants
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.860]  and more about how can we get developers
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.860]  to make really good titles for this.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.220]  Yeah, and I think I was talking about it with Snell recently
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:43.860]  on my show, but to me their requirement
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:48.060]  that Apple Arcade games fully support Apple TV
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.180]  and Apple TV 4K with no exceptions,
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.220]  there's no Apple Arcade game that isn't playable on them
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.940]  is to me a very good sign.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.500]  I mean, again, maybe it's wishful thinking,
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.020]  but as somebody who's really hopeful
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.660]  that they're committed to Apple TV as a standalone platform,
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.900]  that's pretty significant
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.260]  because Apple TV, Apple Arcade is clearly
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.580]  a major initiative for them.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580]  It is one of only a handful of elements
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.340]  of the Apple One bundle.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:16.060]  They promote the heck out of it in the app store.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.220]  They continue to produce,
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.380]  I don't know if that's the right verb.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.580]  I mean, would you call it produce?
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.740]  I don't know what credit Apple gets for the games
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.820]  on Apple TV, but I'll call them the producers.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.180]  Yeah.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.860]  They continue to produce games.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.820]  Hopefully, I don't know, I think it would be very exciting
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.780]  if they made a sort of let's backtrack significantly
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.500]  and come at this idea of pitching people on Apple TV
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.980]  as a game console differently.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.820]  If they're gonna do it,
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.500]  I want them to go all in and do it.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.900]  Don't do any half measures.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.180]  Don't do any last minute changes.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.100]  Make the developers ridiculously happy
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.300]  and that'll make the customers happy.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.140]  All right, let me take a break
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.020]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.100]  It's our good friends at FlatFile.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.100]  One of the worst ways you could spend your time
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.740]  is manually formatting spreadsheets.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.740]  Thankfully, FlatFile has created Portal,
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:09.300]  their elegant import button
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.420]  so your customers can confidently import their data
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.460]  the first time.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.780]  Onboarding customer data with FlatFile Portal
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.140]  frees you, your engineers and your customers
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.060]  from having to manually format
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.700]  and diddle with spreadsheets for hours
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.380]  without needing to maintain custom built data importers
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.700]  specific to the format of a specific client's spreadsheet.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.580]  Portal integrates with virtually any application
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.660]  and in minutes can transform your customer data onboarding
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.340]  from emailing Excel files back and forth
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.140]  to importing even the messiest customer data.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.100]  Are you ready to solve your data chaos?
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.420]  Visit flatfile.io.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.700]  That's flatfile.io.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.820]  That's the whole thing.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:56.060]  Go check them out if that makes sense to you.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.340]  If you're involved in something
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.020]  where you onboard customer data, go check them out.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.900]  My thanks to them for sponsoring the show.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.300]  What else?
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.140]  Tiles, right?
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:08.980]  AirTags.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.380]  I mean, this is the one that's like,
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.020]  it's gotta come eventually, right?
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:14.860]  I mean.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.060]  Unless it gets air powered.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:16.900]  Right.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.860]  And even then it feels like they would just somehow
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.100]  get word out, right?
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:20.980]  I mean, and it's like,
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.740]  I know it's a little different situation than AirPower
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.700]  cause they actually announced it on stage and showed it
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:31.700]  and they've never officially said a word about the tags,
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.180]  but man, this is one that really feels.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.580]  They don't even hide the strings anymore.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.740]  Like the last few versions of iOS
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.940]  have just like had everything in them.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.780]  It's been a while.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.500]  I mean, it's like, not just like betas.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.060]  It's, you know, I, you know, and who knows, you know,
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.780]  if it's a COVID type thing and it's like,
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.580]  couldn't produce them at production problems, you know.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.100]  I still don't know.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.820]  I'm curious about this and it's, you know,
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.940]  it certainly is the least likely to be announced
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.300]  in a press release because I feel like they really want
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.780]  to tell a story around them.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.180]  I still don't know what the heck
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.780]  you're supposed to use them for.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.180]  I don't know.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.260]  I think it's just like you said,
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.540]  it's like a tile-like product where you're supposed to,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.980]  it's supposed to give the benefits of apples
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.660]  and you find my network, you know, a privacy first,
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.260]  but a powerfully, you know,
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.740]  massively distributed location network to anything,
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.660]  your wallet, your bag, your backpack.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.980]  My concern and why I really want an event is that
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.220]  even though tiles have been on the market for years,
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.340]  and even though you could buy pretty much any smartphone
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.780]  to do this, the minute these things are announced already,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.180]  before they've been announced,
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.140]  people are just going to call them like a stocking device
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:38.180]  and say that Apple,
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.260]  the same way like they do with accessibility technology,
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.020]  like the remote listening on AirPods,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.500]  it's a spy craft technology.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.780]  And we're going to have to deal with front page headlines
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.060]  for a week over this.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:47.900]  It is true.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.220]  And going back to the rule that everything is predicted
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.700]  by science fiction and comic books,
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.980]  Spider-Man's had the spider trackers since like the sixties.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.180]  You know, Peter Parker had these little,
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.460]  and of course he took the time to make them
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.660]  in the shape of a Spider-Man logo
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.340]  so that anybody who found one attached to their car
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.100]  would know that it was Spider-Man who was tracking them.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.100]  But it's the same product, right?
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.860]  It is the Spider-Man tracker.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.380]  You just stick it on things.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.660]  And, you know, the whole point of Spider-Man's doing it
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.100]  was to stalk people.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.860]  You know, I mean, we know that, you know,
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.500]  we didn't really see him as doing something wrong
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.740]  because he was using it against criminal elements
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.580]  and super villains.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:32.020]  There was some speculation.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.860]  I forget if somebody found something in the beta or what,
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.940]  but that there's, you know,
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.060]  there's clear signs that Apple's got a feature
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.460]  to notify you if there's one near you.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.580]  Yeah, if you're an iOS user
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.540]  and there's another identified tile next to you,
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.380]  it'll tell you.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.620]  But that's interesting because let's say you're on a bus
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:49.740]  and the person next to you,
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.700]  it just happens to have a tile in their bag.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.780]  Or if you have an Android phone,
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.940]  it's not gonna tell you squat.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.620]  So I'm curious to see how that's implemented.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.060]  Right, you could see why they'd be thinking about it.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.900]  But then as soon as that was announced,
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.460]  other people were like, well, what good does that do me?
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.340]  I wanted to put one on my bicycle seat or whatever,
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.340]  you know, to track this item in case it gets stolen.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.340]  What good does it do if it's gonna tell somebody
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.380]  who stole the thing I'm tracking
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.940]  that there's a tracker on it?
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:22.860]  And the answer, I guess, is going to be to clearly state,
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:26.260]  this is not an anti-theft device, you know?
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:31.260]  For privacy reasons, don't buy these AirTags
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.540]  as anti-theft devices.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.380]  That's not what they're for.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.340]  It's also possible it would be more nuanced than that.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.140]  And it could be that they're in a passive mode
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.900]  most of the time and they don't register anything
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.540]  because they're not doing anything.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.460]  And then when you put them in lost mode,
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.420]  then somebody would detect it.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.180]  And at that point, you probably know where your bike is.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.100]  You're putting them in a more active state,
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.140]  so it's okay to alert people about that.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.700]  And no one can be tracking you in the passive state anyway.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.540]  You'd have to actually turn it on.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.140]  So I think that would probably be a fair compromise.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.260]  I just don't know where I would put them, you know?
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.700]  And it's like, well, I guess I could put one
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.900]  in my carry-on luggage bag, you know, in my suitcase.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.260]  And then when I check baggage at the airport,
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.260]  I can obsessively check whether it made it onto the plane.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.100]  Right?
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.900]  My wife does this with American Airlines.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.980]  If you have an American Airlines account,
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.580]  you can use their app and it'll tell you.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.940]  You know, you check your bags, then you go through security,
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.860]  and then you go and wait, and then you board your plane,
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.140]  and then you can sit there and look at the app
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.620]  or the website and it'll tell you, you know,
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:41.020]  you have three bags that have been loaded onto flight 1821.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.820]  And I don't even wanna know, right?
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.300]  Because it's like, she wants to know,
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.980]  and so she loads it and she always tells me,
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:51.540]  but I would rather just get to my destination
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.380]  and find out then because it would decrease
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:57.780]  the amount of time where I'm upset and angry
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.460]  that my bag didn't make it onto the plane.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.300]  Right?
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.660]  Just don't even tell me.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.620]  Because it doesn't help you, there's nothing you can do.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.020]  What are you gonna do, get off the plane?
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.860]  You know?
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.220]  So I don't know.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.460]  And I don't need it, you know?
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.620]  So that would be my one case.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.660]  The only time I'm separated from my suitcases
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.620]  is when I'm loading them onto a plane.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.460]  I just don't know where I'd put these tiles.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.740]  And maybe I'm lacking in imagination
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.380]  because I've spent the last 12-plus months
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.020]  barely leaving my house.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.860]  And when I do, taking-
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.740]  Did you use tiles?
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.180]  I had the regular tile brand one.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.380]  My wife bought me some years ago,
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.500]  and I put one in my computer bag, and I didn't know where.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.540]  It was a very kind gift, she thought it sounded nerdy.
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.060]  It was very sweet of her.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.580]  And I put one in my computer bag,
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:46.340]  and never lost it, and so I never even used it.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.180]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.260]  I put one in there, I set up the app,
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.620]  and I never had a need for it.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.380]  I had the tiles too, and I did put them in them.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.660]  And I remember a couple times I'd left my bag behind,
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.180]  then I went, but I never needed the tile
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.740]  because I was only at one place.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.420]  So I knew exactly where to go get it.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.700]  It doesn't sound like it's a product.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.100]  I mean, what other things would people want to track?
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.700]  I know people might want to track their kids
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.700]  for safety reasons.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.340]  The dogs.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.500]  Your dog, would you use it as a dog tag?
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:21.940]  It doesn't, it looks like, I don't know.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:26.460]  It's, I don't know, I expect it to come.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.940]  It seems like it's overdue.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.540]  It doesn't sound like it's been canceled,
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.420]  so I guess it's coming.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.660]  I'm most curious what they're gonna say it's useful for.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.660]  And it's interesting because they went to all the trouble
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.020]  of making it, whether it was for antitrust issues
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.020]  or to whatever, they made an API out of it,
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.260]  announced the WWDC so that third parties
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:48.100]  could use the Find My network as well,
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.020]  and you'd have a variety of products.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.740]  I'm guessing the Apple one will just be
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740]  for people who have a high brand affinity for Apple
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.540]  and want something functionally Apple in their key chain,
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.420]  whether they use it or not,
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.700]  it's just like a brand value play.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.780]  But I'm curious to see what third parties
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.980]  decide to do something,
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.180]  like will there be Belkin versions or whatever?
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.220]  And if people will find anything novel to do with them.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.580]  You know, and I guess I didn't mention your key chain.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:17.660]  I guess that's the prototypical thing people often lose
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:22.660]  where a bottle cap-sized thing is not a big ask.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.980]  I don't know, I don't lose my keys, you know?
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.220]  And but this way Apple can sell you
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.900]  because they don't come with a key attached.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.740]  You have to buy that separately like Apple Watch,
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.700]  so there'll be a whole third party,
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.020]  you know, accessory infrastructure built into it.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.740]  You know, it'd be interesting if they do that
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:43.180]  and then maybe they have like a breakthrough design
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.260]  for the key ring part.
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.100]  Yes.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:46.940]  Right?
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.220]  And there's an Elmez, Elmez,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.980]  I have to say it properly, I get yelled at,
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.780]  key chain to match your Apple Watch band.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.700]  Right, right, they could sell little leather things
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.160]  to put the AirTag in.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.420]  You know what, that's probably the whole idea.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.940]  It's all just, it's really just a key chain
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.940]  and it's just an excuse to sell $100 Elmez key chain holders.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.260]  Solved it.
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.540]  All right, what about Macs?
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:20.380]  Do we think we're gonna get new Mac hardware in April?
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.700]  I want, like I want that 16 inch M1, M1X
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.220]  and whatever Apple calls it, MacBook Pro so much.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.360]  I have a feeling we might have to wait till WWDC
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.380]  to get them, the same with the iMac,
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.220]  but I want those just as fast as is humanly possible.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.580]  But on the other hand, they canceled the iMac Pro already.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.740]  Now, does that mean anything
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:46.200]  or is it really just a reflection of Intel
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.900]  just continuing the Xeon chips that were used in it
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:52.260]  and they're not going to re-engineer the iMac Pro
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.700]  for even a speed bump version of Xeon chips
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.580]  that they're planning to do away with anyway.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:03.580]  Like I sort of feel like the iMac Pro's discontinuation date
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.980]  doesn't really, there's not,
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.320]  I wouldn't read too much into that
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.820]  on the expectation of M1 iMacs, but maybe?
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.540]  I totally agree and also like the low end
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.860]  21.5 inch iMacs have been discontinued,
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.180]  but I think that's more along the lines
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.800]  of we're running out and it doesn't make,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.180]  these aren't NFC, NFTs,
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.900]  we can't just mint them when we want to.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.340]  We're not gonna do a whole run just for like three more
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.940]  to keep three more of those in stock
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.540]  until we officially announce something.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.300]  Right, it sounds like the rumors are,
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.420]  and I think you don't,
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.460]  even without paying attention to the rumors,
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.900]  it makes intuitive sense to me that for iMacs,
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.780]  as decades go on, screens get bigger.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:41.620]  Yeah.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:45.940]  So the small size changes from 21 inches to 24 inches.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.940]  The big size changes from 27 to 30.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.660]  That sounds about right to me.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.260]  Yeah, or 32 to match the Pro Display XDR.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.380]  That would be- I've heard both rumors.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.740]  That would be really nice too.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:58.380]  It also seems like that's getting close
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.980]  to the upper limit, right?
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:04.300]  Like, because in theory, if you have a huge desk,
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.540]  sure, a 50 inch display,
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.300]  some people who love a setup like that
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.860]  and people with two 30 inch displays
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:14.020]  and they have effectively a 60 inch
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.120]  effective two display thing.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.100]  Wouldn't it be great if there was one
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.700]  unified 60 inch iMac display?
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:21.980]  In theory, that's fine,
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.460]  but I think it's too niche to dream
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.380]  that they would actually sell something like that
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.460]  as an iMac, but does seem like 27 inches
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.900]  sort of dated as the big size.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.940]  Yes, yeah.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.220]  Especially like, I tend to think,
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.540]  you know, they haven't done this recently,
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.020]  but previously Apple would make the iMac panel
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.100]  and the cinema display panel the same.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:45.960]  You know, you could just choose
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.440]  which one you wanted to get.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.740]  And obviously they haven't continued
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.100]  the cinema display series and the Pro Display is,
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.560]  I think you famously called it 6K for 6K,
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.400]  which is a lot, but just having an iMac that size
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.960]  with like a proper mini LED display,
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.280]  if they can do it at that scale yet,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.200]  I think that's a significant,
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.420]  especially if it gets that redesign,
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.200]  that's a significant upgrade for them.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.480]  And that industrial design is so long in the tooth now.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.520]  Like it still looks good, but the bezels are big.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.640]  It's got that pregnant bump on the back
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.920]  and it hasn't been updated in years.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.920]  It, you could get M1 performance
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.920]  out of a totally flat display, clearly, right?
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.280]  There's no reason for any kind of bump in the back anymore.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.240]  And if it quote unquote only performs
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.160]  as well as the existing M1 Max, that's great.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.440]  I mean, and it's, there are some pro needs
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.680]  from the iMac Pro, you know,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.280]  that it would require like an M1X or something,
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.480]  but clearly the thermals are there.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.760]  And the iMac Pro showed Apple's prowess
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.960]  at thermal design anyway, you know,
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.960]  that they could run these Xeon chips
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.440]  in a totally silent form factor
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.740]  or nearly silent form factor.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.600]  So I'm excited to see it.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.520]  I don't feel it in my gut for April.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.980]  It feels to me like,
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.120]  just feels in my gut like they'll just spend
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.800]  a big chunk of the WWDC keynote bragging
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.320]  about what a great success the initial Apple Silicon Max
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.480]  were, how great it was that developed,
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.800]  you know, a year ago we announced this.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.400]  You guys, you developers did a fantastic job
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.900]  updating all of your apps and being ready.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:39.120]  And we launched the first series of M1 Max in November.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.360]  And they've been, you know, here's a quote
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.340]  from Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:48.560]  And what a great success.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.680]  Customers love them.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.440]  And, you know, here's pictures of people loving.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  History leading, power per watts.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.720]  Right, and battery life and blah, blah, blah.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.280]  Now we're ready for the next step and the next step.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.680]  And, you know, just do a big announcement
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.880]  and announce Pro MacBooks.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.080]  And again, I know that there's a 13-inch MacBook Pro
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.440]  with the M1, but do the one with four ports
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.540]  and that supports as many displays as you can fit on a desk.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:18.060]  Do the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.600]  Have an iMac story and talk about how the iMac now
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.320]  is a totally credible Pro level.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.840]  It will be thanks to the M1 Pro desktop.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.400]  And maybe, maybe even, I mean, the only other Mac
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.120]  that's left is the Mac Pro.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.320]  But do it all at once, right?
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.360]  So what's left?
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:43.360]  There's the Pro level 13-inch MacBook Pro
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.880]  with four ports and higher specs.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.960]  The entire 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:54.880]  possibly the 13-inch would go to 14 inches, right?
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.600]  And that it would be more of a bezel to bezel,
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.400]  you know, where the footprint doesn't grow,
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.880]  but the same way without growing the footprint of the device.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.380]  Big fan to snap the bezels.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.220]  Right.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:08.460]  Maybe an exciting new design, new colors for them.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.380]  Who knows?
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.300]  iMac obviously had to, you know,
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.100]  from one end of the spectrum to the other,
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.720]  still hasn't been touched.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.540]  And the Mac Pro.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.540]  Maybe an M1 Mac Mini, like an M1X Mac Mini,
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.780]  because they reintroduced the silver version
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.340]  and it feels like the Pro version,
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.840]  well, the Pro version is still Intel.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.680]  Right.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.700]  And they could do like with the same chip
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.980]  that goes in the 16-inch MacBook Pro could go in there.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.780]  Right, and that's the same sort of situation
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:35.460]  with the quote-unquote 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.940]  where there are Pro ones and non-Pro ones, right?
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.340]  With more ports and the capability to drive more,
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.520]  bigger and more displays, et cetera.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.360]  Yeah.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.500]  You know, is it too much?
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.940]  When you think about the colors on the iMac,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.340]  because that was a weird rumor to me,
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.660]  not that they haven't made colored iMacs before,
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.380]  but like in the modern era,
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.700]  just having to manage supply chain
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.580]  and you know, how many weeks of inventory
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:06.780]  on like a pink or a sky blue iMac, it's interesting to me.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.840]  Yeah, I say why not though, right?
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.960]  And I don't know.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.540]  I would like to see them do something like that.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:15.540]  It seems like it's been a little bit too boring
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.820]  for too long that you can get your iMac in one color
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.540]  and one color only, and that's aluminum.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.540]  And I know the iMac Pro had the darker color,
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.600]  but again, only one choice.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.380]  So I kind of-
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.100]  One of the brief things that we were at,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:29.940]  and I was just like,
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.580]  why can't we get the big stuff in rose gold?
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.100]  And they were like, it's too big, it's too much rose gold.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.900]  And I said, I'm gonna file a radar
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.860]  asking for this rose gold.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:40.900]  I just don't know if the actual rumored colors,
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.660]  which the rumors seem to be doing it all
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:48.020]  sort of like the iPads are colored.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:48.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.540]  Where they're all sort of muted light colors.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:54.460]  Like, I don't know, why not do the iMac ones
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.780]  in very bold colors, right?
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.620]  I mean, that's-
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.440]  Like the iPhone 12.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.240]  Right, do it like iPhone 12 style
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.860]  where there's a black one and it is black.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.240]  And do one where it's product red
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.000]  and it is just a big, bright red iMac.
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.500]  And if there's no bezel on the front,
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.580]  the red wouldn't distract you from the display.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.940]  It would only be something you see at the base
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.860]  and from the back.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.220]  I think some people would love that.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:21.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.980]  Like the old product red iPhones
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.860]  when they were still aluminum,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.240]  just that look was so good.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.940]  Right, if they get rid of that chin,
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.460]  which I would expect that they could
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.500]  and would like to do.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.080]  And so that you really just see your iMac from facing it
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.240]  is really just a display that goes as close
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.700]  as practical to edge to edge.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:42.880]  I think that opens up the door to bolder colors
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.620]  that would be distracting if you saw a big strip of it
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.580]  as a chin at the bottom of the display.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.780]  You know, do a vibrant blue iPhone 12 blue style blue iMac.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.420]  That to me would be the way to go.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.940]  I think the muted ones that just sort of look like aluminum,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.780]  but like dip, you know, like an Easter egg into a dip
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.520]  and it's got like a pink tint.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.340]  Yeah, I mean, give us blue Dalmatian and flower power,
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.180]  you cowards.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.340]  Right, how about this?
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.940]  Make a black MacBook Pro or nearly black, right?
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.060]  Space gray, like not space gray.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.220]  I'm talking like, you know, black, black.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.420]  Like iPhone 7 black.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.560]  Yeah, people would go nuts for that, I think.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.300]  Cause I think we've had, you know, the same sort of very
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.660]  narrow range of aluminum-ish colors.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:32.340]  You know, I mean, I know that was one of the jokes
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:36.300]  in the Justin Long IBM ad, but it's like, you know, it is,
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.640]  you get like, you can have gray or you can have grayer gray.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.480]  Yeah, no, it's absolutely true.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.700]  And they, you know, what has Apple said
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.020]  about promising Apple Silicon?
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.700]  They've said they're gonna finish the transition this year.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:51.540]  They're very good.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.020]  Well, in two years, so they have until dub dub next June.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.520]  The Mac Pro would be the one that you would expect
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.900]  might take the longest.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.100]  I mean, it's a nichest product.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.040]  And there were some leaks about them doing a spec bump.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.580]  Like there was some, I forget what it was,
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.760]  but like the latest Nvidia cars, Navi 2,
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.720]  and I think some more recent Zeons showed up.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.860]  But after those commercials, I just think Apple
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.100]  probably lost all their taste for Intel spec bumps.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:19.780]  But you know, there are people who need the big things.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.620]  I don't know.
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.500]  It seems like too much to ask for them to announce
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:27.500]  all of the remaining Apple Silicon Macs at WWDC,
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.580]  but maybe some of them are just pre-announcements, right?
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.240]  And I kind of feel that the initial promise from a year ago
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.800]  of we're gonna finish this in two years
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.520]  was giving themselves an awful lot of ability
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.060]  to under-promise and over-deliver.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.180]  Like the Steve Jobs thing, right?
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:43.020]  Right.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.860]  The PowerPC, he said two years and finished it in a year.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.860]  Right, and this transition, I know,
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.120]  I know that there's a bunch of people at Apple
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.300]  who have been there, you know, they have so little turnover
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.740]  overall for a tech company, and that there were people
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.760]  working on this transition who were there
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.500]  for the PowerPC to Intel transition.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.280]  And I would say so far in every way, it's been even better.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.560]  And that transition went very smoothly.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.740]  But you know, the first machines are even better.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:20.340]  The OS transition was as seamless as you could hope.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.740]  So I would anticipate, I'm optimistic,
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.900]  I'm bullish on them being pretty aggressive
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.700]  at just saying, okay, we're out, we're done with Intel.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.580]  And I just don't think they have any taste,
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.400]  they have no taste for those Intel machines.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.940]  They don't care for them.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.900]  No, I think you're totally right.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.660]  And I think exactly what you said about the iMac,
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.020]  where the thermal envelope can be so much smaller
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.620]  for Apple Silicon, will apply to the Mac Pro as well.
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.620]  And either you'll get so much more space
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.860]  for whatever they make, however they continue
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.560]  the modularity, like with MX cards
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.780]  or whatever they do there.
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:51.340]  Or you'll just have a smaller case
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.900]  and be able to take out that giant Xeon chip
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.060]  in its heatsink, that giant AMD GPU with multi-layers.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.680]  You know, there'd be so much more room
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.820]  for them to do interesting things.
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.620]  Yeah, so it just feels like the whole thing
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.960]  fits better at WWDC, and that they can have
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.540]  some of them ready to go, like they're gonna go
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:12.980]  on sale tomorrow or go on sale later this month.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.920]  And some of them maybe are coming later this year.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.760]  I don't know.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.060]  Like an October Mac event, if they go back to tradition.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.700]  Or, you know, I don't know.
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.300]  I just feel like, it doesn't feel like
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.300]  an April thing to me.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.940]  I'd be pleasantly surprised,
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.800]  but I just don't expect Macs this month.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.060]  Yeah, no, totally the same.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.820]  And I want them as soon as, like again,
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:36.860]  as soon as inhumanly possible.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.860]  Right.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.660]  I just feel like they got off to such a good start
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.300]  and it still gives them runway
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:47.620]  and it all fits together better at WWDC.
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.140]  Here's an idea.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.020]  I have not heard rumors about this.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.720]  Maybe there are, I don't stay up on them all.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.580]  But there's a missing Mac in the lineup,
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:01.160]  and that is the two-pound MacBook.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.060]  Like the MacBook Air is 2.8 pounds, I think,
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.940]  and the MacBook 13-inch MacBook Pro is three pounds.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.860]  There's a lot of PC laptops that are about two pounds.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:15.120]  I forget how much the no-adjective Apple MacBook
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.060]  that they've, you know, the adorable one-port thing.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:18.900]  Yes.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.740]  But something that-
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:20.560]  MacBook nothing.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.940]  Something that makes the MacBook Air look thick and heavy.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:25.780]  Yes.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.860]  Well, there's a couple rumors for a couple of missing Macs.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.860]  There's a rumor that there'll be a G4-like cube
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:32.660]  for either a Mac Mini Pro or a Mac Pro Mini.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.380]  And then there's rumors that there'll be an M2,
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:37.720]  a next-generation MacBook Air that'll slim it down
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.180]  even more, down to something closer
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.860]  to what the 12-inch MacBook,
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.660]  maybe still with a 13-inch screen,
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:45.560]  because maybe they can fit it in with zero bezels,
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.580]  or maybe, you know, it's still 12-inch,
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:48.860]  but it will be the higher,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.340]  like the current MacBook Air will be the $999 one,
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.420]  and then this will be the higher-end version of the Air
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.500]  with the new design and everything.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.420]  Yeah, I wonder, though, and who knows?
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.380]  I mean, because the names are the sort of thing
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.140]  that leak the least, and maybe it's the same device, right?
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.060]  And people are thinking it might be a MacBook Air,
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.920]  it might be the iconic wedge shape,
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.960]  but they wouldn't call it the MacBook Air?
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.620]  I don't know, and...
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.300]  They'll pretty much call it MacBook Stealth again
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.220]  and everyone will lose their minds.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.500]  I don't know, maybe it was wishful thinking,
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.420]  but I just, I don't know,
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.660]  there was something to the fact
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.940]  that they called the MacBook just the MacBook
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.780]  that just said to me,
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.420]  this is what they think a MacBook should be,
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.300]  and it was so constrained performance-wise,
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:36.540]  and the one port idea played out so poorly in practice.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.900]  And the pricing never could go down
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.720]  if they never managed to reduce the cost enough
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.860]  to get it down to a reasonable price.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.220]  Right, but it's, you know,
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.080]  there are definitely PCs out there
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.140]  that are significantly lighter in weight.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.260]  I mean, I just was reading a Verge story
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.900]  about a new ThinkPad, and it's 2.0 pounds,
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:56.460]  and that is significantly less than a MacBook Air.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.460]  Or the LG Gram, which are much, much lighter
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.980]  than their MacBook counterparts.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.820]  Yeah.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.640]  And it's weird there's no MacBook.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.180]  Like, there's an iPad, there's an Apple Watch,
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.820]  there's an iPhone, and there's no MacBook.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.420]  And I realize part of that is the success
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.860]  of the MacBook Air branding,
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.500]  because it came to mean both light and inexpensive,
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.180]  and that leaves very little wiggle room
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.640]  for a MacBook nothing.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.940]  But it feels like at some point
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.460]  you gotta force that back into the brand.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:21.700]  Yeah, so I, you know,
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.740]  and they've been known to do that,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.580]  and just sort of, you know,
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.900]  iBook has been like six different things.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:30.420]  Yes.
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.680]  I don't know, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the thing,
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.940]  but it just feels like, man, that is something that they,
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.540]  like if they were willing to do it
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.340]  with Intel Atom processors,
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:42.300]  why in the world wouldn't they do it with M1 processors
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.980]  that we know can run in the thermal envelope?
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.680]  Because they run in our friggin' iPhones.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.520]  So.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.340]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.780]  I know there's no like rampant rumors
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.600]  that such a thing is coming or slated,
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.160]  but it just feels like they have to,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.820]  they have to be thinking about it, you know?
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.260]  And they could even do,
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.580]  they could even do a good keyboard
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:03.140]  where the keys travel because they have so much room inside.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:06.540]  The A14X is gonna run in the 11-inch iPad.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.260]  I mean, that's much more constrained
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.300]  than any MacBook would be.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.780]  Right, so that would be on my list.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.580]  But again, I don't expect it this week.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.700]  All right, here's on my list.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.020]  iOS, not a hardware announcement,
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:24.020]  but devoting some segment of the show to iOS 14.5.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:28.740]  I think, I said this to you in chat the other day
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.620]  when we were setting up doing this show,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.820]  it just popped into my mind.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.820]  I've been running iOS 14.5 since the first beta
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.140]  because I wanted to try the mask thing.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.860]  I mean, I've been known to run the betas anyway,
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:44.860]  but I put the betas on my Apple Watch and my phone
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:49.020]  so that I could try the unlock your phone
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:52.300]  while wearing your Apple Watch if you have a face mask on.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.260]  And I wrote about it.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.140]  And again, I can't encourage people
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.200]  to install beta OSes on their devices,
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.300]  but this is a super stable OS.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.240]  I've been running the beta since the beginning,
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.140]  and I think I had like one bug in one, like the second beta,
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.140]  there was a weird thing that was clearly an OS bug.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.060]  But on the whole,
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:15.720]  it's clearly as stable as release versions of iOS.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.500]  The mask thing is a game-changing feature.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.380]  It's truly phenomenal.
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.300]  I know some people are gonna say finally,
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:30.380]  it's probably gonna be the most finally thing
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:34.260]  in all of the news when iOS 14.5 comes out,
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.340]  but it is a great feature.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:38.820]  I don't think it was easy because I think it's so contrary
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:42.660]  to the way the ML models were trained on people's faces.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.400]  Well, it's non-trivial because the phone unlocks the watch.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.700]  And so there's so much room for potential exploits.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.280]  And they thought about it so carefully.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.100]  Like it's even if you unlock with your watch
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.540]  and then someone takes your phone and leaves,
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:59.900]  I forget what it is, like a hundred, it's several meters,
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.460]  it'll lock again because they're assuming
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.580]  someone's grabbed your phone and tried to get away with.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.780]  Like there's so many edge cases that they thought out
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.540]  that it's a really smart implementation.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.180]  So it's been great overall.
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.420]  But I feel like the aspect they're gonna,
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.260]  they don't wanna spend too much time,
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.700]  I don't even know if they'll mention the mask thing,
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.920]  although I think they should,
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.560]  because I think it's a great way to get people
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.380]  to upgrade their OS,
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.480]  maybe the next best thing since adding new emoji.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.980]  But I- You'll have to demonstrate,
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.220]  find my, like if those air tags come out,
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:30.780]  they'd have to do it, like Craig will have to come up
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.320]  and explain, find my network and the privacy policies
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.160]  and everything.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.480]  But I think that they're holding the release of the OS,
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.180]  I mean, who knows, again, this could be the thing
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.260]  where this whole segment of the show is ruined
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.580]  because it'll come out tomorrow.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.600]  But I think they're holding it for the event
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.500]  so that they can, and they'll say it's gonna be available
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.220]  an hour after the event,
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.860]  one o'clock Eastern time or whatever.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.380]  It's available today, it's going to be ready.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.580]  The OS seems so ready.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.360]  But I think they want to explain all this ad privacy stuff
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.560]  and do it their way,
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.560]  because this is clearly the most controversial thing
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.840]  Apple is involved with at the moment,
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.840]  is their conflict with Facebook very explicitly
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.860]  and the tracking ad industry as a whole.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:21.180]  I think Apple wants to talk about this
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.940]  and say how, put their spin on what this means
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:27.700]  when you upgrade to this OS and get asked,
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:30.560]  would you like to allow Facebook to track you
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.460]  in the background?
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:36.000]  Did I give you my quick rundown on privacy policies yet?
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:36.840]  I'm not sure if I did.
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.660]  I don't think so.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.500]  But I have an analogy for this
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.880]  where Apple is basically like going to a fancy restaurant,
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.660]  like a three-star Michelin restaurant.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.140]  It's an expensive meal, but it's usually a really good meal.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.720]  Like they'll sell you a shiny box,
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.100]  but then you pay your own way and you're out of there.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.720]  Google is like being bought a lobster dinner.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.760]  You get it for free,
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.520]  but they spend the whole time leering at you
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:58.880]  and you've got to decide what it's worth
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.300]  for you to put out for that dinner.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.820]  And then Facebook just feels like it's a buffet,
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:06.520]  but you have to eat it while you're naked and being probed.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.540]  And these are entirely different.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.340]  And different people have different limits
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.360]  for all of these things.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.120]  But I think as we learn more and more
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.940]  about what they take in exchange for what they give,
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.760]  we'll all have our own comfort levels with those things.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.760]  And they start you with a mild roofie
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:24.920]  so that you don't mind the probing.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.160]  Yeah, but that's literally how
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.380]  their business models are working.
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.260]  And I think we're just learning things
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.640]  like what Apple's doing with the privacy policies.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.400]  And when you see the reaction of people like Mark Zuckerberg
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.980]  who still has complete first-party access
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:41.440]  to all of our data, how angry they get about it,
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  I think it's more telling than just what Apple's doing.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.100]  Yeah, I just think that they want to sell it.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.660]  I think they want to pitch it.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.440]  And it just, in Apple's mind,
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.360]  and if they could release it first and then talk about it,
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.600]  but that's just not Apple's style,
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.880]  to say like, hey, this OS that's been out for a week,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.440]  we'd like to tell you about it.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.060]  They want to tell you about it, get you excited about it,
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.960]  and then tell you you can download it later today.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.000]  That's just Apple's style,
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.400]  whether it was ready or not engineering-wise.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.560]  And it also sort of fits with the,
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.260]  more than a rumor,
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:22.840]  but the word that Apple's original date for this event
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.840]  was March 23rd, which I've heard from people
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.520]  not even at Apple, but people at a company
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.400]  that might be demoing something at the event sort of thing,
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.560]  or have something that they are supposed to have ready
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.040]  the day that Apple has an event,
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.000]  that March 23rd was maybe not planned and canceled
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.560]  or postponed, but maybe the original soft deadline.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.560]  iOS 14.5 seems like it could have been released
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.280]  by that date, in my opinion, just sort of fits with that.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.240]  And it's like, for whatever other reasons
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.280]  they might have pushed back the date two weeks or a week
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.640]  or three weeks or whatever it winds up being,
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.840]  iOS 14 wasn't the reason, or 14.5.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.660]  Yeah.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:10.760]  Yeah, well, it feels like those dates
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.120]  were like echoes of early planning,
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.480]  just what potential dates could we have?
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.360]  And then as different products lined up,
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.200]  like we talked about this before,
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.120]  but like an Apple event is basically shooting arrows
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.080]  at other arrows and hoping they all hit each other
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.200]  and then hit the target.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.020]  Right.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:24.860]  So that's a lot to core.
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:26.060]  Well, I'd say everybody who's ever worked
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.440]  with anything with deadlines knows that if the best,
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.480]  if you really, really, really wanna make sure
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.080]  that in the worst possible case,
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.960]  you ship something by April 14th,
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.640]  a good way to do that is to shoot for March 23rd.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.560]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.520]  It's just the way deadlines work
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.520]  and it's certainly the way they might work
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.840]  even worse than usual with all the remote work
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.320]  and everything else that's going on.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.400]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.080]  and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.320]  good friends of the show, Squarespace.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.020]  Look, if you're listening to this show,
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.000]  I'll bet you know how to build a website yourself.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.120]  I'll bet you know a bunch of frameworks you could use,
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.720]  things you could install.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.440]  You probably know how to run SSH
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.400]  and you could do stuff the manual way.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.860]  I suggest the next time you need to build a website
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:21.640]  for yourself, but especially when a friend or family
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.520]  or somebody you know comes to you and says,
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.960]  hey, I need a website for blank.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.340]  Start at Squarespace and do it the Squarespace way
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:33.800]  where you do it all in the Squarespace website itself.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.160]  And you go there and you can do everything
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.320]  from registering domain to configuring the way it looks
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.160]  to looking at your analytics,
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.560]  to picking which components you want to add
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  to your website, image carousels and portfolios
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.400]  or a store where you can sell something
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.040]  and all of the e-commerce stuff
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.360]  is all goes through Squarespace automatically.

[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.480]  It's all real, you get 30 days free to try it,
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.120]  set it up, use it, put it out in the real world
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:17.060]  and then after the 30 day free trial,
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:18.800]  that's when you need to pay.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.080]  And that's the time to remember the URL,
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.120]  squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.520]  because that's how they know you came from the show.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.520]  That same code, talk show, know the, just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W,
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.040]  gets you 10% off your first order
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.880]  and Squarespace lets you prepay
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.900]  for up to your entire first year.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:42.240]  You can save 10% off your entire first year
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.640]  just by using that code, talk show.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.360]  Remember it for your own needs
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.960]  next time you need a website and definitely remember it
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:51.440]  next time someone comes to you for help
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.080]  setting up their new website.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.280]  That's it for my maybes for April.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.520]  Do you have anything else that might come out
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.700]  in a week, two weeks?
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.000]  No, I think like there were early rumors
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.420]  of an iPhone SE Plus but those have sort of evaporated
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.060]  over time and while an iPhone SE
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.640]  is typically a spring product for Apple,
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.480]  it just doesn't sound like it's imminent at this point.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.940]  Yeah, I think the idea, so the idea was
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:21.940]  the SE was taking like a two or three year old phone,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.960]  keeping the hardware and putting an up-to-date chip in it
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.960]  to give that form factor legs for years to come.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.160]  And the new SE, the current one,
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.560]  that's what they did with the iPhone 8.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.560]  They took an iPhone 8, updated it to the A13.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.560]  Was that right, the A13?
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.840]  Yeah, and now it's a product with a home button
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.260]  and a familiar form factor that will be more than usable
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:56.500]  for years to come at a low price point.
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.480]  For people who either A, just want to get
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.140]  the cheapest possible iPhone that Apple sells that's new
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:04.640]  or B, are like my mom and really, really, really
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.240]  just wanted one that worked the way
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.240]  her previous iPhone did because that's just how she is
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.560]  and it's like I know my mom is a very smart woman
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.720]  and she could easily figure out how to use a Face ID iPhone
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.760]  and if that's what she had to do,
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:22.780]  she'd figure it out just as fast as anybody else
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.840]  but she did not want it and I didn't need the grief
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.780]  so we got her the new iPhone SE and she loves it.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.080]  The missing idea would be that hey, there was the 8 Plus,
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.520]  why not make an iPhone SE Plus
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.560]  that just looks exactly like the iPhone 8 Plus
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.920]  and sell it for 50 bucks more or whatever.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.320]  Seems plausible.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.400]  There's more than enough rumors about it
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.580]  that it certainly seems like Apple kicked it around.
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.680]  I think their reluctance to do it though
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.320]  is that they sort of have a thing going on
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.300]  where if you really do want a big, physically big iPhone,
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.600]  you pay a premium.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.160]  Yeah.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.480]  Yeah, well, that was the other part of the rumor.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.800]  One of the rumors was it would actually be an iPhone 8 Plus
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.200]  that was tricked out but then the other rumor
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.360]  which also seems to evaporate is that it was more geared
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.280]  towards other markets and it would be something akin
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.000]  to an iPhone XR, iPhone 11 design
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.320]  but instead of putting a more expensive Face ID module
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.800]  on it, they would just use the power button
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.800]  fingerprint reader from the iPad Air
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.080]  and it would be like a first,
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.400]  I guess another attempt at an entry level,
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.780]  a sort of modern iPhone.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:38.200]  That seems plausible to me
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.480]  but if they're like sort of backed away from it,
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.840]  maybe it's that the iPhone SE is selling so well
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.280]  that they're like we don't need to go there.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.960]  We'll just keep, you know, the SE's good.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.800]  We're good for another year with the SEs.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.680]  It is, you know, keep it simple.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.760]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like that's much rumor.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.840]  It seems like whatever the idea there is,
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.160]  no, not happening.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.100]  Yeah.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.840]  What else is going on for the rest of the year?
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.640]  I don't want to spend too much time speculating
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.140]  about iPhones, iPhone 13 in the fall.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.760]  There's the the Gurman story though
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.920]  which is I thought was really interesting.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.720]  Mark Gurman had a report that Apple's working on a,
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.820]  or considering, strongly considering
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:17.560]  a more rugged Apple Watch that internally
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.700]  they're calling the Explorer edition
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.960]  and it would be sort of, you know,
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.640]  he had no details about its design
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.600]  but think, you know, he mentioned the Casio G-Shock watches
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.060]  which are truly, truly meant to be very durable.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.600]  Like I always, it's one of those commercials
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.760]  that's just burned in my brain
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.960]  where they, the original 1983 G-Shock,
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.340]  they strapped around a hockey puck
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.700]  and showed a guy slapshotting into a net.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.400]  Like pretty, you know, pretty rugged.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.960]  I mean, you certainly wouldn't do that with an Apple Watch
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.340]  as is.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.640]  I think this is a great idea
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:57.060]  and I think that it would sell very well.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.800]  I think it would expand the market for Apple Watch
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:04.460]  because I just think, and I think it would sell a lot
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:07.560]  to people who aren't doing particularly rugged things.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.860]  You know, like if, let's say you're a rock climber.
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.240]  Well, you would love to have this watch, right?
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.280]  Because the glass and sapphire of the existing models
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.760]  is not good for smashing against rocks.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:20.600]  Yeah.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.440]  Yeah.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.720]  Also people who work construction
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.560]  or any sort of job that has high impact.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.380]  And that's one of the things that Apple does
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.760]  is that they start to look at the next adjacent market
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.720]  that they can move into.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.840]  Like, it's like one step from what they do now.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.540]  And there are people who are excursionists or adventurers
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.960]  or do extreme sports or work in construction,
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.920]  those sorts of things.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.600]  And it's taking everything that people already like about it
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.720]  and just taking it that one step sideways
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:45.640]  that increases their market.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:46.480]  I think it's really smart.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.880]  Yeah, construction is a great market, right?
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.120]  And it's hopefully booming as the economy recovers.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.980]  It's just a huge number of people work in construction
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:01.980]  and wearing a glass-faced watch is just not a great idea.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.760]  Law enforcement, military,
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.600]  I mean, there's just so many applications.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.680]  Right, and I think it's very good.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:11.000]  I really think a lot of people,
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.680]  it's the same thing with people who put their iPhones
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.200]  in not just cases, which we know most people do,
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.260]  but like those Otterbox-style cases
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.020]  that are really thick and very super protective.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.880]  My mother-in-law uses one of those,
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.520]  and she has no real practical need for it.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.440]  She just feels better.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.140]  She feels like whatever $600, whatever her iPhone costs,
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:36.520]  that's way too much money to spend on a thing
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.400]  with what looks like a delicate screen.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.400]  And she would not enjoy owning a phone
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.520]  if she just had it in a lesser case.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:49.540]  Some people feel like that.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:52.120]  It's probably people who are a lot more sensible
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.480]  with their money than I am.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.680]  But also, G-Shock has almost a cult-like following.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.640]  It is something that people have a high affinity
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.320]  and nostalgia for, and I could see people
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.440]  having sort of the same reaction to this.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.720]  It's also the sort of thing where Apple Watch,
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.200]  so an iPhone is amenable to being encased
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.800]  in a very durable protective case.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:17.880]  And I'm sure that if Apple built,
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.440]  in John Syracuse's ideal world where there's way more,
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.920]  they expand way more into other product ideas,
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.920]  if Apple built an iPhone designed to be rugged,
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.320]  like what's the Panasonic brand for laptops
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.200]  that are used on construction, the Toughbook, right?
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.160]  The Panasonic has a long-standing successful line
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.840]  of laptops that are meant to be used
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.480]  like on a construction site and have dust
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.000]  just all over them and be dropped and stuff like that.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.080]  If Apple designed an iPhone to be used
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.740]  in circumstances like that without putting it
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:58.080]  in a case of some sort, some people would buy it.
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:01.240]  I would just be curious to see what it would look like.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.480]  What would their ideas for that be?
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.680]  But you can put an iPhone in a durable case.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.840]  You can easily, schools, every school with iPads does it.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.220]  They put iPads into durable cases.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:15.940]  The design of Apple Watch is such that,
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.040]  I know some people sell things that you can use
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.600]  to sort of, but it's just the way you put bands on
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.960]  and the way it sits on your wrist,
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.960]  like it's nowhere near as cool and as low profile
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.760]  on your wrist as something like a G-Shock
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:36.760]  where it's built into the construction of the case itself.
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.760]  I don't know, and Gurman's report wasn't very clear.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.560]  Seemed like it was a maybe for this year, though.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.600]  I don't know.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.920]  Yeah, he's been throwing, like he also threw out
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.760]  the idea of home pods with displays on them,
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  almost like there's a one-liner in another story.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.400]  So it could just be things that he's hearing,
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.480]  but that aren't big enough really
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.880]  for full fleshed out stories.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.800]  I think the watch, Apple Watch,
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:04.080]  I'm calling it Apple Watch Sport to reuse the name.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.020]  I don't think, I know he said that internally
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.600]  they're calling it the Explorer Edition.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.620]  I don't think they would ever ship it like that
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:13.960]  because Rolex famously sells a watch called the Explorer.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.600]  And I realize there's only so many words,
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.320]  and I don't think anybody would say
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.680]  they're ripping Rolex off.
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.400]  There'd be no confusing a G-Shock style Apple Watch
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.940]  with a Rolex Explorer.
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:30.020]  So, I don't know.
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:31.240]  And they couldn't call it Excursion
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.500]  because of Ford or A-Shock.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.340]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.540]  Just call it Sport, Apple Watch Sport.
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.260]  But I would be excited to see it.
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:38.780]  I also think that it would,
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.580]  I'm presuming it would be priced commensurate
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.860]  with the current aluminum Apple Watches.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:48.100]  You know, that it wouldn't be a higher priced product,
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:52.580]  that it would be in line with the new,
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:57.060]  this year's model year, lower end watches,
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.420]  which I think now start at like 300 bucks,
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.220]  is that right, or are they 400?
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.060]  That's something like that,
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.500]  but I think Apple might charge a bit of a,
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:04.980]  just because, especially in the beginning,
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:06.200]  they might charge a bit of a premium
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.040]  because they think they can.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.040]  But if you keep it around for a year, though,
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.380]  and then they reduce the price,
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.500]  you know, I'm just going towards saying
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.580]  that for people buying them for their kids,
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.100]  which is definitely a feature Apple is pushing
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.380]  in terms of adding the support
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.220]  for setting up a second iPhone,
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.060]  you know, like.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:24.900]  Yeah, the family setup.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.300]  Yeah, the family setup, which they've made clear
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.700]  is for children and for like older, elderly parents,
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.580]  you know, who may not be able to do it themselves
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:34.920]  or don't have an iPhone or something like that.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.420]  You know, and there's all sorts of limits,
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.020]  you know, built in for like children limiting your kids
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.500]  and like, you know, being able to set it
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.260]  so they can't screw around with their iPhone
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.620]  while they're in school and stuff like that.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.260]  I just think that there's an awful lot of parents
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:48.980]  who would be more, if they're on the fence
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:51.100]  and they're like, maybe I would buy my kid
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:54.260]  a $300-ish Apple Watch, right?
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.340]  And it's like, it's something they would think about.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.060]  I think there's an awful lot of them
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.620]  who could be nudged off the fence into the,
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:02.180]  okay, I'll get it, let's get it for him
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:05.060]  if it looked like a G-Shock durability-wise
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:08.140]  as opposed to looking like Apple Watch does now.
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.920]  And I think Apple Watch is probably more durable
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:15.540]  without any extra protection than most people,
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.180]  those people might think.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:19.260]  I think it's really pretty darn durable.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:25.260]  But it's, you know, it still is a glass screen.
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.660]  And I just think the psychological benefits
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:29.660]  of having it look like that would push,
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:33.060]  really help push parents into buying them for their kids.
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.940]  Because the expectation, the expectation is that your kid,
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.460]  your 10-year-old might be over the moon,
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:42.580]  ah, Apple Watch, exactly what I wanted for Christmas,
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:45.500]  and then they're not gonna take any care of it whatsoever
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.180]  or be any less reckless on the playground.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:50.940]  Right, they're gonna be a kid, that's how kids are.
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:52.160]  And people know they're kids,
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.220]  and they know they're like that.
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.320]  I just think that, I don't know,
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.140]  that was one of the most interesting rumors I've seen.
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.420]  Because I've thought about it before,
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.100]  but then once I read the report, I was like,
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:05.000]  this is a surefire hit, in my opinion.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:09.100]  Yeah, makes the kind of sense it does, totally.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:12.360]  Anything else that you wanted to talk about?
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:16.360]  Ah, I'm sorta out.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.400]  What do you think?
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:21.560]  Yeah, I think we hit all the big notes.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.720]  What do we wanna talk about that you do elsewhere?
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.160]  You've got your YouTube channel.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.260]  How many?
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:28.540]  Yeah, it's my one-year anniversary.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:29.880]  You were kind enough to have me on
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.920]  when I first quit my day job and went indie,
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.480]  and that was a year ago this Thursday, I think.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.440]  Well, there you go, I didn't even plan it this way,
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.160]  but happy anniversary.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.280]  It's going very well.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:40.640]  Indie-versary.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.160]  It's going very well.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.160]  Thank you.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:47.120]  I don't know how you publish as many videos as you do.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:51.240]  It seems mind-boggling to me, but you're, you know.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:52.600]  I cut down, I cut down recently.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:55.560]  I'm trying to do, I was doing like four to six,
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:57.080]  sometimes eight a week, and now I'm trying
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:57.920]  for like three.
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.760]  That's crazy.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:59.680]  I think I can do two or three.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.680]  I mean, do you sleep?
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:06.080]  I do, but I lost, I made the choice to lose everything.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.120]  I didn't have a back catalog,
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:08.560]  I didn't have anything to feed YouTube,
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.760]  and YouTube really works well
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.200]  when you give it a bunch of data
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.880]  about the kinds of videos you make.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.240]  So I wanted to build back that back catalog.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.320]  You know, it's like if you had to start over
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.720]  with Daring Fireball, you'd have to write a lot
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:18.840]  just to get it into Google.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.040]  I get it, I get it.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.320]  You are also on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.320]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.160]  People can, you know where to get that.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.800]  Get it in your favorite podcast app.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:30.640]  Yeah.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.080]  What else, what else do we wanna talk about?
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.680]  Ah, that's mainly it.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.400]  I do a podcast with Georgia Dow
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.120]  that we talk about psychology of technology,
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:40.360]  which I always find endlessly fascinating.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:43.160]  And I get to do the talk show with you all,
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.120]  which is always wonderful.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.320]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.520]  Let's see how right we are.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.040]  Hopefully by the time the show comes out,
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.880]  they'll have an event announced for next week.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.280]  We'll look so smart.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.440]  Maybe they could wait a day and then, yeah,
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.520]  and then like we'll have a record in place.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.160]  It's not like we recorded multiple versions
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.000]  of all the different dates.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.920]  Please don't start any conspiracy theories.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:08.920]  All right, thanks, Renee.
