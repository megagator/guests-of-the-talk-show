[00:00.000 --> 00:03.640]  So live in life one I'll tell you yeah, you know
[00:03.640 --> 00:08.760]  It's like you know everybody knows growing up that if you only have one I you you lose depth perception
[00:08.760 --> 00:13.000]  You know it and you can play with it for five minutes by closing one of your eyes or whatever
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.220]  But if you'd to spend two weeks with only one good eye
[00:17.760 --> 00:19.760]  fucking sucks
[00:19.760 --> 00:24.680]  I swear to god. I'm always bumping into people like like in the supermarket or like
[00:24.680 --> 00:29.800]  Shake shack. I just bumped right into a guy cuz I have no idea how close I am to people
[00:30.240 --> 00:34.560]  And it's not just depth perception, right? It's a blind side like you're living with the blind side
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.320]  So you have you know things coming at you from that side and you don't know they're there until the last second
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.680]  Yeah, I what did to me as a and I'm not driving I haven't even at but I live in a city
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.520]  So I don't need to drive but as a pedestrian when I hear footsteps
[00:48.520 --> 00:52.520]  It's my left eye and when I hear footsteps on my left from behind me. It's
[00:52.520 --> 00:58.840]  Total freak out it really is it's it is bizarre because it's like I don't see them until they're in front of me
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.960]  Like a primal response. Yeah, well, it's just years of city living
[01:03.960 --> 01:06.200]  I don't know you just if you hear footsteps behind you
[01:06.200 --> 01:10.840]  You know when you're supposed to see them if they're you know somebody's walking faster than you and they're gonna they're gonna
[01:10.840 --> 01:17.360]  Pass you you just know when you're supposed to see them and for it's like five or six feet off for me now
[01:18.120 --> 01:20.120]  It makes you wonder how
[01:20.120 --> 01:22.120]  Pirates got anything done I
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.560]  Think that's why they use telescopes instead of binoculars
[01:29.320 --> 01:35.480]  Yeah, that's like they were like binoculars. I only need one. Can you can I just could hang it half off if I just have the one?
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.880]  So Matthew Panzerina welcome to the talk show I can't believe it's been this long and that you've never been on the show
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.400]  Yeah, I was I was starting to get a complex
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.800]  You are my officially delegated surrogate from this week's
[01:51.160 --> 01:53.160]  Apple event two days ago
[01:53.560 --> 02:01.000]  Yeah, I was life-casting. We just had a permanent meerkat open. I just hung my life-casting camera around my neck. How about that app?
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  I I just joined yesterday
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.880]  I haven't done anything with it yet, but what's the deal with that meerkat?
[02:09.400 --> 02:11.640]  I mean, it's interesting for sure there's
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.640]  There's been like like live streaming stuff like this for a long time
[02:15.880 --> 02:22.120]  You know the whole Justin Khan Justin TV thing which turned into Twitch and the whole bit so there's it's not like that
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.240]  This is a new concept. It's just there's a bunch of factors that are all aligning to I think
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.800]  Create an uptake of it like Twitter has critical mass now LTE is everywhere
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.120]  You know, there's a variety of of little things that have kind of added up to I think we're gonna see a little research into this
[02:38.120 --> 02:43.960]  But meerkat itself is interesting. It's it's one tap. You know, you can start streaming immediately
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.040]  It doesn't require you set up any accounts because he uses Twitter as a backbone
[02:49.800 --> 02:53.880]  Yeah, it's kind of compelling, you know, I I mean, I I'm not the kind of person who's gonna just
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.920]  stream constantly, but if I'm doing something really interesting like my first meerkat I did was
[02:59.640 --> 03:00.760]  on a
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.640]  Rollercoaster Disneyland, so a couple minutes
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.280]  Yeah, it's a couple minutes before I got on California screen when I opened it up
[03:08.600 --> 03:12.680]  and I started talking to people and you know before I knew it 30 40 people are on there, right?
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.080]  And they're just watching me stand in the line for the rollercoaster and so I said, okay
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.720]  We're gonna get on I was like give them a little rollercoaster history
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.360]  You know why this rollercoaster was different than other ones blah blah blah and I just sat there and like 30 people
[03:24.680 --> 03:26.680]  Came along with me on the ride. I held it up
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.400]  That was in front row. I held it up and they rode the rollercoaster with me which I thought was interesting
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.920]  So but if anybody out there doesn't know so meerkat it's an iPhone app
[03:37.560 --> 03:43.800]  I don't think it's is there an iPad version or is it iPhone only? No, it's just iPhone. So it's iPhone only no website no Android
[03:44.920 --> 03:49.880]  Not that I know no, I don't get iPhone only you sign in with Twitter
[03:49.880 --> 03:53.160]  You have to you know Twitter is the only option you sign in with your Twitter account
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.000]  And if you want to you can start streaming at any time
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.120]  And I guess it uses the FaceTime camera and or I guess either camera
[04:00.120 --> 04:03.640]  Yeah, either you can flip it back and forth and when you hit stream
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.560]  It tweets for you and just says whatever you want it to say like hey
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.640]  I'm outside the Apple event or hey
[04:09.640 --> 04:16.520]  I'm going on Space Mountain and then you're you know your Twitter followers will see the tweet and if they want to they
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.320]  They tap a thing and it takes them over to the meerkat app and they can watch it with you
[04:22.200 --> 04:23.160]  Yeah
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.560]  It's extremely simple the interface just has a little row of icons that kind of show you
[04:27.560 --> 04:29.560]  The Twitter
[04:29.560 --> 04:35.400]  Profile picture of the people that are watching and then they can when they reply to you in app
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.400]  It tweets publicly so the conversation happens in public on Twitter. Oh, right right and that is I think essential to it
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.320]  Is there when they reply to you the tweets show up in the app itself?
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.360]  So you could hold like and I saw a bunch of a whole bunch of people did this after the Apple event
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.200]  As they had to hold a meerkat session and do like Q&A and their Twitter followers could say
[04:54.200 --> 04:59.720]  Hey, am I can I just buy the millenies band on my own? Yes, yes, you can you know
[04:59.800 --> 05:02.040]  Whatever but they can ask the questions and you see them
[05:03.080 --> 05:09.080]  Right, and I think that that feedback that instantaneous access to people is compelling. I have a
[05:10.040 --> 05:12.040]  I'm gonna thinking about this like
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.960]  What does it do? What is the purpose? I mean, I don't know what the purpose is
[05:16.280 --> 05:18.120]  I don't know whether they're gonna be able to monetize it
[05:18.120 --> 05:20.600]  I don't know whether it's a fad. You know, I don't know any of that stuff
[05:20.600 --> 05:25.480]  I'm not trying to predict the future on that, but it does seem interesting to me as a sort of empathy machine
[05:26.040 --> 05:29.320]  Because when you see produced video of a person
[05:29.320 --> 05:30.520]  There's a disconnect
[05:30.520 --> 05:34.840]  You know stuff that's something is not live. It's not immediate and I think that snapchat
[05:35.080 --> 05:39.880]  Mircatt vine a lot of these things that are producing sort of raw or content
[05:40.920 --> 05:47.720]  Those are kind of all along the lines of these empathy machines where they create a feeling of empathy with the person that you're watching and the person
[05:47.720 --> 05:53.480]  That's viewing and so that's an interesting thing to me whether or not it'll last I don't know, but that's that's kind of
[05:54.120 --> 06:01.240]  Something to watch. I think it seems to me my first take I'm late to pick this up like I said
[06:01.240 --> 06:05.320]  I don't even signed up for it yesterday. I think or maybe the day before but
[06:07.240 --> 06:09.800]  It and I get when did it come out like last week
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.520]  Yeah, it's it's kind of a long story
[06:12.520 --> 06:16.040]  They had they had this other thing and then they they stopped doing it because they had a lot of problems
[06:16.040 --> 06:18.760]  But this was an offshoot of that and a couple of weeks ago
[06:19.320 --> 06:22.920]  They put it on product hunt and it just kind of took off from product hunt
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.760]  and a bunch of the
[06:24.760 --> 06:28.120]  Technorati started using it and then you know because that it's
[06:29.160 --> 06:35.080]  It's sort of an incestuous Twitter group everybody started grabbing it and watching with the streams and then creating their own
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.520]  Because like I said, it's one tap
[06:36.520 --> 06:42.280]  So once you open the app you can start streaming immediately. There's no complicated setup now, and it's you know
[06:42.280 --> 06:47.640]  It it does seem like a typical valley venture play because surely that
[06:48.520 --> 06:49.560]  The
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.080]  All this free streaming is costing them money. I mean streaming is not cheap
[06:54.760 --> 07:01.080]  Right, right. Absolutely. It's not it's it's got to take us a nice backbone of server architecture to
[07:01.640 --> 07:04.680]  Execute and Twitter just actually bought an
[07:05.240 --> 07:09.320]  Unlaunched sort of version of me or cat called periscope
[07:09.320 --> 07:15.640]  We we heard that they'd bought it a we could go and I guess somebody else just confirmed it yesterday or whatever
[07:15.880 --> 07:17.880]  But it's it's very
[07:18.440 --> 07:21.800]  Interesting in terms of a Twitter accessory, you know, yeah
[07:22.360 --> 07:26.840]  Well, but that's interesting too though that they Twitter just bought somebody who does the same thing because to me
[07:26.840 --> 07:30.680]  It seems as though mirror cats play is to get bought by Twitter
[07:31.560 --> 07:33.560]  Right because right
[07:33.560 --> 07:38.600]  It's and I don't blame them like in some sense in some ways putting the business aside
[07:38.600 --> 07:43.960]  And who's gonna buy whether you're hoping to IPO or whether you're hoping that's Twitter buys you or somebody it's
[07:44.760 --> 07:50.120]  It's very interesting to me that the one and only way to sign into the thing is Twitter that they're completely
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.640]  Building it as a I mean, and who knows they might change that in the future
[07:53.640 --> 07:57.320]  But at least right now it is completely built on the back of Twitter
[07:57.960 --> 08:03.320]  And like you said the the replies go out as tweets everything is a public conversation
[08:03.320 --> 08:10.120]  Outside of Maricat on Twitter other than the stream itself, which is in Maricat. Yeah, and I think they did that
[08:10.120 --> 08:13.080]  I think the founder said something I was watching a little thread with them
[08:13.080 --> 08:13.960]  I didn't ask him personally
[08:13.960 --> 08:19.480]  But he said that they did it that way because their previous product which was also a streaming product of some sort
[08:20.280 --> 08:25.800]  They had a lot of problems with trolling, you know with people streaming and then people jumping on their creating
[08:25.800 --> 08:27.800]  user names or whatever and and being
[08:27.800 --> 08:34.120]  Acidic or or you know crappy to people streaming and so they they said that the public conversation
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.960]  Actually worked better people were more on on point. I believe you know
[08:40.440 --> 08:47.000]  But and also it also sort of puts the onus on Twitter to handle the creation of throwaway spam accounts
[08:47.800 --> 08:55.480]  Yeah, it's actually know that something Twitter obviously has to be doing anyway. It's not certainly not like they're adding to Twitter's burden
[08:55.480 --> 09:03.800]  No, no, I mean they it's a smart move to offload any of the complexities of creating a commenting structure or
[09:04.200 --> 09:08.040]  Account management to another network as long as your model
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.640]  Isn't hurt by the fact that you're not owning your network
[09:12.200 --> 09:13.880]  And so that's as you mentioned
[09:13.880 --> 09:15.960]  That's one of the key things. It's like what are they trying to do?
[09:16.040 --> 09:22.120]  Well, it seems like they need to be sort of held in the bosom of a larger thing unless they figure out a way
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.880]  To monetize it that doesn't remove the simplicity, you know, what are you gonna do in your cat with like
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.360]  Sponsored by such and such layered over the top of it. I don't know maybe, you know
[09:35.320 --> 09:38.360]  So you did a mere cat from outside the event
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.880]  Yeah, I did yeah, so I pop why I did actually one kind of inside the event just before it
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.160]  You know, they typically get kind of angry at you if you stream the stuff because they're already streaming it or whatever
[09:49.160 --> 09:53.960]  So I just did a little bit before the event to let people see what what was going on inside there
[09:53.960 --> 09:59.000]  And then a little bit from the demo room, and you know kind of let people walk around and and and then I did
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.960]  Did a question Q&A afterwards in the st. Regis, which is
[10:05.160 --> 10:08.920]  Across the street and it was just sat in the lobby there and answered a bunch of questions people
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.080]  Were tweeting me about like the watch and the laptop and stuff just trying to stream a consciousness it. Yeah
[10:15.080 --> 10:24.040]  Yeah, yeah, how many people do you get watching us? Uh, like the the final Q&A did I think I got like 250 or so Wow, that's pretty good
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.160]  Yeah, I mean as a fraction of people as remember this is a synchronous thing, right?
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.640]  It's you cannot it's not asynchronous in any way she performed people have to be fully dedicated
[10:34.360 --> 10:36.600]  Their whole iPhone screen is given over to you
[10:36.680 --> 10:42.200]  This is why by the way these VCs are or salivating right and looking at these apps and going like oh my god, you know
[10:42.200 --> 10:44.760]  Because you're you're actually reaching out and taking over
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.440]  Somebody's complete attention and their entire screen of their iPhone anytime you can do that. I mean
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.680]  That's that's insane, you know, I think that the next five years is going to be a
[10:57.960 --> 11:00.200]  Transition and it's already started yeah, it's to me
[11:00.200 --> 11:06.040]  It started with Instagram when Instagram started iPhone only and that's you know years ago at this point
[11:06.040 --> 11:13.240]  Um, but I feel like Instagram was so far ahead of its time in terms of going app only to launch
[11:13.640 --> 11:19.640]  And I feel like the next five years is going to be a transition in that direction and not even just phone only
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.240]  I mean clearly eventually, you know, you could go watch only at this point
[11:23.240 --> 11:26.280]  I mean as we'll get into over the course of the show, but that
[11:27.240 --> 11:34.680]  Doing a website and making it a web service that anybody can just go to you know, I guess it would be meerkat.com or whatever is
[11:34.680 --> 11:38.920]  A old way of thinking and not that it's a bad not that it's bad
[11:39.480 --> 11:45.000]  And not that there won't be in the future brand new things that start as websites and have success in their appropriate
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.040]  It's just that there are certain ideas and concepts that work
[11:50.920 --> 11:54.040]  Better or best or maybe even only as an app
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.800]  Yeah, yeah, I absolutely agree. I think you're you're sort of unlocking
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.160]  I would have to say most of it is around is built around context, right?
[12:05.480 --> 12:11.800]  Because the mobile device offers there's only really one context for web and that's that somebody's looking at their computer screen
[12:12.280 --> 12:15.480]  Whereas the context for mobile is a lot of things your location
[12:16.120 --> 12:22.440]  Your speed your the weather like there's lots of other things that are coming into play when you have a mobile device
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.920]  It could be literally anywhere in the world at any altitude above the surface of the planet
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.400]  You know or below and all of a sudden you've got a lot of a lot more variety of stuff
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.720]  You know what if somebody's creates a version of mere cat just for spelunkers, right?
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.320]  Oh, I you know, I love spelunking. I want to watch the spelunking
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.120]  Channel, well, it's no longer a channel on a website. It's a that's a bespoke app
[12:44.520 --> 12:46.920]  You know just watching spelunkers go down in caves
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.760]  And I think that there's gonna be a lot of interesting stuff like that whether or not those will scale
[12:50.920 --> 12:53.800]  I don't know, you know, but the other thing too
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.960]  And I think you touched on this a few minutes ago is that it's like with LTE and it's pervasiveness and it's
[13:00.440 --> 13:05.160]  Relative incredible speed is just how far we've come so quickly like
[13:06.120 --> 13:07.640]  You know eight
[13:07.640 --> 13:11.000]  Seven years ago when we had the original iPhone it
[13:11.800 --> 13:13.800]  Didn't even do video
[13:14.200 --> 13:17.800]  And let alone have a front-facing camera had one camera shooting in the back
[13:17.800 --> 13:28.200]  Didn't do video peer-head and had edge cellular networking which really struggled even to load complex webpages
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.560]  And seven years later people are streaming live
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.960]  High definition video from this from the secondary camera on the device
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.480]  Yeah, I mean, and it's it's really good. I mean the video quality is pretty solid
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.360]  I mean, there are some finicky stuff. There's some finicky stuff about it. I think they need to improve but it's
[13:50.920 --> 13:53.240]  I mean, I've watched streams obviously and it's
[13:54.200 --> 13:59.880]  Transportive, you know, you're you're there and that is insane the fact that we can
[14:00.520 --> 14:07.480]  And I've walked around with it and moved and I remember I remember with video streaming they went to this whole period where
[14:08.440 --> 14:09.400]  the
[14:09.400 --> 14:16.440]  Bandwidth was so poor on cellular but just enough but but too poor to really support it
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.280]  Where you would get this bursty thing where it was just like oh, you know, well, it's fine
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.120]  And then it's really really bad for 10 minutes and that that would kill it, right?
[14:24.120 --> 14:27.320]  You would be like I'm not gonna watch this. This is annoying, you know, it's stuttery or whatever
[14:27.560 --> 14:31.080]  So any if any one of those little factors doesn't work then live streaming doesn't work
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.440]  So now we've got all the kind of pieces so it'll be interesting to see if it actually explodes this time. Yeah
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.440]  Yeah
[14:38.440 --> 14:43.560]  I think I'm it definitely caught my eye and the design of the app did too like it is
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.440]  Like you said, it's one tap and to me
[14:46.760 --> 14:50.360]  I know it's like you think like well, they're you know, they have a simple ID it's
[14:50.600 --> 14:57.240]  It's really hard to get there design wise to get into that you can do something like that like this the more brain dead simple
[14:57.880 --> 15:02.760]  Stupid something looks the harder it was to get from the original idea down to that
[15:02.760 --> 15:06.440]  You know one button away from streaming simplicity
[15:07.080 --> 15:10.840]  Right one of the indicators that I see of how easy it is
[15:10.920 --> 15:11.880]  It's actually funny
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.080]  But I've seen this a lot because I've been kind of watching it as I picked it up a couple weeks ago and then and have been
[15:17.160 --> 15:23.960]  Investating other stories about other similar setups as I've been I've been kind of monitoring which people join and when they start streaming
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.200]  And I've noticed that almost everybody you didn't because I got the push notification for you joining
[15:30.200 --> 15:34.840]  But because it basically uses your Twitter network. So you're I'm gonna get a notification for anybody
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.240]  I follow on Twitter joining it, right? Right, but
[15:38.120 --> 15:44.600]  I noticed that almost everybody joins and then immediately starts streaming and I'm convinced it's because they think there's more steps
[15:45.400 --> 15:47.400]  And they hit the stream button
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.840]  And they just start streaming and by the time I see the notification and then I go in they've already stopped
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.120]  And I have an adding to ask somebody who does it next time they do it
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.160]  Did you just do it because you thought there'd be like more setup or more steps? And I think it's because
[16:01.640 --> 16:04.360]  They go, oh, there's got to be more and they just hit the stream button to see
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.720]  Oh, what do I have to do to set this up and boom their cameras on and they're like, oh
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.080]  They shut it off
[16:09.080 --> 16:10.360]  But it's a funny thing too
[16:10.360 --> 16:13.560]  Well, not even funny, but just interesting and to me, you know
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.200]  I'd be shocked if they don't come out with an Android version sooner rather than later
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.480]  I mean I but but going iOS first
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.440]  You in addition to being able to piggyback off Twitter and the social
[16:28.280 --> 16:35.560]  Graph as they call it the social graph that you already inherit by by using that as your thing and yet you don't have to create your own user account system
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.560]  And you don't have to police your own
[16:37.560 --> 16:47.560]  Spam account thing etc, etc, but by going on iOS you also get to piggyback off the built-in support for Twitter account system wide and so you don't
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.400]  You don't have to type your password you just say hey mere cat wants to use your Twitter account is that all right
[16:53.960 --> 16:59.640]  Yes use this Twitter account that I've already configured and you're in and that is huge too
[17:00.120 --> 17:02.600]  Because even if you have a shitty password even if you're not
[17:03.160 --> 17:10.760]  You know doing the right thing and having you know uppercase and lowercase and numbers and punctuation and and all sorts of stuff
[17:10.760 --> 17:16.040]  And it still is always a pain in the ad. It's even a pain in the ass to type in a shitty password truth be told
[17:16.040 --> 17:21.880]  And they totally get to skip that in terms of just getting people on on board
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.520]  Right and that that conversion rate goes way up when you have that access like any shopping cart
[17:28.600 --> 17:33.160]  You know if you're logged into Amazon you're much more likely to buy toilet paper or whatever than if you're not logged in
[17:33.160 --> 17:36.760]  You have to find your password. It's just the same concept. Yeah, and then the well
[17:36.760 --> 17:39.400]  I'm even thinking like just to say somebody's following you and
[17:40.040 --> 17:41.880]  Maybe they've heard of mere cat whatever
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.440]  But then they see that you say you're tweeting from the Apple event and they're like oh shit
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.560]  I would like to see that he's not even goofing around right now. This is something
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.080]  Follow the link download the app launch the app
[17:53.640 --> 17:57.000]  Boom, you're in like you can and like you said it's it's synchronous
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.000]  You know you have to you're you're doing this live
[17:59.400 --> 18:06.680]  But even somebody who hadn't even downloaded the app could catch in and jump into your stream and I would honestly say a minute
[18:06.680 --> 18:11.800]  Right like give it 30 seconds for the app to download and 30 well they have a web experience
[18:11.800 --> 18:14.840]  So they do have a web version. It just doesn't you can't comment
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.680]  You can't see all the stuff, but you can see you can watch the stream on the web
[18:18.760 --> 18:23.960]  So they did provide a web viewer like a barebones viewer, but it runs on flash and it's not great
[18:24.040 --> 18:28.120]  So it's sort of the access a teaser, but yeah, I think you're right
[18:28.120 --> 18:30.520]  I think you could within a minute download the app
[18:31.160 --> 18:34.920]  Log in because of obviously it's pre-logged in for you essentially
[18:34.920 --> 18:38.840]  We just opt in and then start watching the stream
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.520]  Absolutely, yeah, as long as somebody didn't shut down the stream within a minute you'd be watching them
[18:42.520 --> 18:48.760]  Yeah, I think that a lot of people who are gonna join are gonna do it at some point when they see oh here's a stream
[18:48.760 --> 18:55.160]  I'm actually interested in starting right now. I better jump in and you can do it and because of the
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.680]  You know the fact that they're piggybacking off the system
[18:59.880 --> 19:02.600]  User, you know Twitter accounts and etc etc
[19:02.600 --> 19:06.680]  All right, let me take a break before we start talking about the event and
[19:08.840 --> 19:14.760]  I want to talk about our first sponsor. It's our good friends at igloo
[19:15.560 --> 19:23.160]  igloo is an internet you'll actually like you can share news organize your files coordinate calendars and manage projects
[19:23.640 --> 19:26.840]  All in one place their latest upgrade Viking
[19:26.840 --> 19:35.960]  Like the football team from Minnesota Viking revolves around documents and how you interact with them gather feedback and make changes
[19:35.960 --> 19:37.960]  They've even added the ability to track
[19:38.600 --> 19:42.120]  Who has read critical information to keep everyone on the same page?
[19:42.520 --> 19:47.400]  So if you've got like a document that needs approval or needs everybody to sign off on it
[19:47.480 --> 19:50.840]  You can mark it so that hey show me who's seen it and then when you post it
[19:51.720 --> 19:53.720]  To igloo you will get
[19:53.720 --> 19:58.280]  Like effectively read read receipts for who's seen it if you want it
[19:58.600 --> 20:02.440]  It's like read receipts in your email or an iMessage, but less annoying
[20:03.320 --> 20:09.640]  And it helps you track whether your colleagues have read or acknowledged policies to sign off on legal agreements or
[20:10.520 --> 20:14.280]  You know anything like that confirmed the completion of training materials. Whatever
[20:15.560 --> 20:21.800]  If your company if your team has a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 90s and it probably does
[20:21.800 --> 20:26.440]  You should give igloo a try you can sign up for a free trial
[20:27.240 --> 20:31.640]  Up to 10 people use it for free at igloo software dot com
[20:32.360 --> 20:33.480]  slash
[20:33.480 --> 20:36.280]  TTS like the talk show TTS
[20:36.760 --> 20:41.000]  I think you can also use slash the talk show and that will work as well
[20:41.400 --> 20:43.400]  So my thanks to igloo
[20:43.400 --> 20:48.440]  If you have a team you need an internet go check them out at igloo software dot com slash TTS
[20:48.440 --> 20:51.160]  So the event Monday
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.960]  Mm-hmm. What do you think overall?
[20:55.800 --> 20:59.240]  I thought it was good. I mean there are several standout things for me
[20:59.240 --> 21:02.200]  I mean I think that as usual when they have
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.200]  Said something before and they say it again. Like this happens a lot at WWDC
[21:06.200 --> 21:10.040]  You get a lot of the whole rehashed stuff and people kind of tune out
[21:10.040 --> 21:14.280]  You know until they somebody says something new so there was some of that going on with the watch stuff
[21:14.280 --> 21:20.360]  But I think that there were several key things obviously leading with research kit was a very a big curve ball
[21:20.840 --> 21:21.880]  and I think
[21:21.880 --> 21:24.840]  Anybody in my feed and and people in our back channel were
[21:25.480 --> 21:31.480]  Were definitely like what what what are we talking about? What is this and I think that that was a
[21:32.040 --> 21:35.560]  Smart move to kind of start with that and and say hey
[21:35.560 --> 21:40.520]  We're gonna talk about this cool thing. We're doing instead of maybe at the end where everybody's like, oh, yeah, whatever
[21:40.520 --> 21:42.520]  You obviously put this at the end because nobody cares, right
[21:42.520 --> 21:49.320]  So I think that was interesting the whole research kit thing is I think in an enormous long-term project
[21:49.320 --> 21:51.160]  I thought it was a research kit
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.160]  I number one it was interesting in and of itself
[21:53.160 --> 21:56.040]  But it was interesting in so far is that it completely
[21:56.920 --> 21:58.920]  went against the
[21:58.920 --> 22:00.920]  last two months narrative of
[22:01.400 --> 22:04.840]  Apple is totally backing away from health monitoring and
[22:05.560 --> 22:08.440]  all this like health and you know fitness
[22:08.440 --> 22:13.960]  Trackings to stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I did fly in that face
[22:14.440 --> 22:18.200]  Flying the face of that stuff and I don't think that wasn't calculated
[22:18.680 --> 22:21.560]  If that if that makes sense, I think they probably definitely
[22:22.440 --> 22:27.560]  Acknowledge that it was going on and knew that it was going on and and it didn't hurt that that was right up front
[22:28.120 --> 22:30.920]  The big thing to me obviously when he said it was open-sourced
[22:30.920 --> 22:35.080]  I think everybody kind of was like whoa, you know, and they didn't necessarily expect that
[22:35.080 --> 22:41.160]  But in hindsight, it makes complete sense. So research kit is this framework that allows
[22:42.040 --> 22:44.200]  organizations like hospitals to do
[22:46.040 --> 22:53.960]  Patient research on conditions like Parkinson's and other other conditions and gather feedback essentially from those patients as far as the
[22:54.440 --> 22:56.440]  symptoms and their
[22:56.440 --> 22:58.440]  reactions to treatments and
[22:58.520 --> 23:00.520]  That's a that's an enormous
[23:00.520 --> 23:05.960]  You know, I hesitate to see market, but it's an enormous opportunity. I guess for for hospitals
[23:08.040 --> 23:10.040]  Yeah, it's it's definitely
[23:10.680 --> 23:15.240]  It's clear just from how much time they spent on it in the event that it's a major initiative
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.040]  And it really does seem as though, you know, it's
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.360]  It's all new territory. There's never been anything like this before
[23:23.240 --> 23:30.360]  No, and there the difference they did say this in the keynote that a lot of the research on this is done with very small sample
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.600]  sizes. Yeah, it's done on paper and a lot of stuff like that. And that's all accurate
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.680]  I talked to some people about this and
[23:37.320 --> 23:41.400]  You know, they're they're incredibly excited. You know people that are in this field in the medical field
[23:41.400 --> 23:44.600]  They're like whoa, you know, this is it's gonna be awesome because yeah
[23:45.160 --> 23:49.320]  The iPhone is still a demo right iPhone owners. That's still a demographic
[23:49.720 --> 23:57.240]  So you're not necessarily getting the absolute you know broadest spectrum, but it's way more than a thousand people with pieces of paper
[23:57.240 --> 24:02.600]  You know, so that's it's gonna be back. I think yeah, and with the regarding the open source
[24:02.600 --> 24:05.960]  I saw a lot of cynicism in that regard
[24:07.320 --> 24:10.840]  specifically hardening back to the announcement of FaceTime
[24:12.360 --> 24:15.000]  That's gonna buy that's gonna come back to light them over and over
[24:16.360 --> 24:18.360]  When was that to 2010
[24:18.760 --> 24:22.440]  2010 2011 I don't yeah, I think I don't remember exactly
[24:22.440 --> 24:29.160]  You know, obviously Steve Jobs was still alive because it was Steve Jobs who announced that and we're going to make it an open protocol
[24:29.160 --> 24:33.080]  I don't think he said open source. I think he said we're gonna make it an open protocol
[24:34.920 --> 24:42.600]  So that you know, everybody you know other phone makers could or computer makers whoever could make FaceTime compatible software
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.160]  And obviously that didn't happen
[24:46.120 --> 24:49.960]  Yeah, the quote was we're going to the standards bodies starting tomorrow
[24:49.960 --> 24:57.080]  We're going to make FaceTime an open industry standard. Okay. That was in 2010. That's WWE. So there's a lot of people are like so
[24:57.080 --> 24:59.080]  Yeah, but there's a little bit of movement
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.520]  Right after FaceTime, but so the here's the thing this truly is one of those like
[25:05.400 --> 25:07.080]  Things are different without Steve Jobs
[25:07.640 --> 25:11.080]  Like I've said to people on Twitter Steve Jobs was impetuous
[25:11.560 --> 25:17.720]  And I know for a fact that the FaceTime team found out that they were gonna take it to open standards bodies
[25:17.720 --> 25:20.520]  Exactly when we did when it was announced
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.360]  Like that's brutal. That was something that Steve Jobs decided during rehearsals
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.560]  The week prior to the announcement
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.440]  He was like why not you know, let's do this and didn't talk to the lawyers didn't talk to the team
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.840]  So the source code nothing was written with the idea that it would be an open standard and
[25:40.520 --> 25:45.400]  That I know and then this I don't know, but it's I'm pretty sure
[25:45.400 --> 25:47.720]  Having talked to people over the years about it that
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.120]  They've had a lot of lawsuits regarding you know patent related lawsuits regarding FaceTime
[25:54.840 --> 26:00.680]  and at least one of them made them change the protocol at some point and
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.480]  Because they're what I think it actually related to a time when FaceTime got flakier
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.320]  Like they had to do so they had to make some changes and it actually made it worse
[26:09.320 --> 26:16.840]  Oh, yes, I remember that it was their routing protocol or something. Yeah, it was the way that they handed off from like a phone call
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.360]  From a cellular network to the data network or something. Yeah, it was I don't know the details
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.280]  I don't think are as interesting as just the basic story though
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.080]  Which is that patent litigation forced them to change the protocol so they couldn't have even gotten you know
[26:29.240 --> 26:31.960]  They couldn't even keep the protocol that they shipped with
[26:31.960 --> 26:39.480]  Themselves let alone make it an open standard and and there are so it's the whole area is so patent
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.880]  Accumbered that it just that it's more or less why they've given up on it
[26:44.200 --> 26:46.680]  I mean who knows maybe someday they will submit it
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.640]  You know they'll have it in shape to do but in terms of it's been you know
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.480]  Four or five years and it hasn't happened
[26:53.560 --> 26:56.120]  It's because when they went when Steve Jobs announced it
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.320]  It just was not a vetted vetted by engineering or vetted by legal declaration. It was jobs saying we're gonna make it a you know
[27:03.480 --> 27:05.480]  An open standard and
[27:06.200 --> 27:11.800]  Tim Cook is not a type of CEO like if they say they're going to open source health or
[27:12.520 --> 27:15.880]  Not health kit, but research kit. They're gonna open source it
[27:16.920 --> 27:23.960]  And I guess that the research kit team knew that plan all along and you know has been right
[27:23.960 --> 27:28.120]  I don't know. I don't know anybody. I have no sources on the research kit team
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.920]  So I you know there could be people in Cupertino listening to this podcast going oh god. You're so wrong. We're fucked
[27:33.720 --> 27:34.920]  I don't know
[27:34.920 --> 27:42.040]  We found out seen time. You did but my guess is though that they knew this all along and that they've written it because it is true
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.320]  That's very true. It is really hard to open source
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.160]  That's any significant code base that was not intended to be open source from the get go
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.400]  It's just talk to any programmer. It's just just axiomatic
[27:55.880 --> 28:02.200]  Yeah, and I'm not a programmer. So this is this is essentially because it's in a woven with stuff that you don't want to open source
[28:02.280 --> 28:03.640]  Right, yeah, and you know
[28:03.640 --> 28:10.360]  It's almost like designing a a space like a building like if you you know a space that's meant for the public to come in is different
[28:10.360 --> 28:15.880]  Than a space that you is not meant for the public to come in just you know in terms of where you put the doors where you put locks
[28:16.040 --> 28:18.280]  What's you know bolted down?
[28:18.280 --> 28:22.840]  And yeah, and like what libraries you use what dependencies you have
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.360]  You know, it's yeah, so my guess is that this will be open source right on schedule with no hitches
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.520]  Yeah
[28:30.520 --> 28:36.840]  Why the schedule thing you'll be interesting, but yeah, I don't think it'll be a year's delay or or nobody's ever going to talk about it again
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.400]  Like FaceTime. It's it doesn't make sense. I mean
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.520]  What they're trying to do only actually make sense if other people have access to it
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.240]  I mean not what they're trying to do but the spirit in which they're trying to do it right
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.120]  So if they're trying to say we are genuinely interested in improving the quality and quantity of research
[28:56.840 --> 29:03.480]  In this arena then the only way to really honor that is to say it's not just iPhone users
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.960]  You know, we're gonna open source it so anybody can access this framework and and do these things
[29:08.200 --> 29:12.040]  It's just work we need we felt we needed to do and cook said something
[29:12.040 --> 29:14.360]  Essentially reiterating his
[29:14.920 --> 29:19.240]  We don't pay attention to the ROI statements at the recent shareholders meeting
[29:19.320 --> 29:22.760]  He said something about research kid and and some other efforts
[29:22.760 --> 29:28.600]  They did as far as like diversity stuff and so it's I think it is genuinely a thing sure
[29:28.600 --> 29:30.200]  It's good PR for them, right?
[29:30.360 --> 29:33.000]  Obviously, but it it also is something
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  I think that where they saw an opportunity
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.760]  That they could execute on this because they were already doing stuff in that space
[29:38.760 --> 29:42.120]  And it would benefit them for sure, but it would also benefit
[29:42.280 --> 29:45.880]  You know the public at large and why not you know in at this point
[29:46.200 --> 29:51.880]  They have the resources and money to spend on these things and it just seems like cook is more willing to say
[29:52.680 --> 29:58.920]  Okay, you you people do this you take this chunk of resources and do this. Yeah, I agree
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  I you know, I think that
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.320]  It doesn't mean you have to be any less cynical about Apple as a for-profit corporation
[30:05.320 --> 30:12.840]  But that it's true some of the stuff they do is not about the ROI. I know that I didn't see anything about the shareholders meeting yesterday
[30:12.840 --> 30:18.600]  But I know he repeated that again a week or two ago when he was in Europe
[30:18.760 --> 30:21.480]  and I think it was when he was in London and and somebody
[30:21.560 --> 30:25.640]  You know, he took questions from store employees and there was press there and that somebody asked about
[30:26.760 --> 30:32.440]  Accessibility and whether the watch was going to be accessible and he just said it will be and that they take it seriously
[30:32.440 --> 30:39.800]  And it's just one of those things where they don't measure the ROI they don't measure whether they sell enough iPhones to
[30:41.080 --> 30:48.840]  Vision impaired people to justify the cost of the engineering of making everything accessible to they don't even measure it because it's just the right
[30:48.840 --> 30:54.920]  Thing to do and clearly they can do it and still be very profitable. It's just the right thing to do and I believe that
[30:54.920 --> 30:58.200]  I truly believe that they don't measure the ROI on stuff like that
[30:58.200 --> 31:03.720]  Yeah, and he said that this at this shareholders meeting
[31:03.720 --> 31:09.800]  I guess he said Apple didn't do this for the ROI in reference to research kit. This just isn't the lens Apple uses
[31:09.800 --> 31:11.800]  that was the
[31:11.800 --> 31:16.040]  The phrase that he used and of course we got as a as a news organization
[31:16.040 --> 31:20.120]  We get you know pitches from from everybody immediately after falling to swim
[31:20.120 --> 31:22.120]  So we get pitches from these people
[31:22.120 --> 31:30.120]  That are either shareholder interest people or conservative organizations or you know capitalist advocates and stuff
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.640]  We get all these pitches immediately afterwards
[31:31.640 --> 31:36.680]  And so they're like oh, we were very disappointed with Tim Cook denigrating capitalism and you know all this
[31:37.720 --> 31:41.880]  It's actually pretty amazing how was the first people get when he says I mean
[31:41.880 --> 31:47.640]  It's a small statement, but it is very tricky to say that and and very tricky to say about the right things
[31:47.640 --> 31:52.920]  Because his job is to maximize investor return as an overall CEO
[31:53.400 --> 31:57.160]  So it's it's a powerful statement more powerful than I think people give it credit for
[31:58.280 --> 32:00.280]  I would actually
[32:00.280 --> 32:02.280]  that's actually a
[32:03.240 --> 32:04.600]  I like
[32:04.760 --> 32:06.920]  80s going forward
[32:06.920 --> 32:14.200]  Thing and it's actually not the job of the CEO. There is like it's people say that it's it's become like part of the
[32:14.200 --> 32:22.600]  It's a lot of people who put it in those terms that the job of the CEO is to maximize investor returns
[32:22.600 --> 32:23.640]  And it's actually not true
[32:23.640 --> 32:28.600]  You can't there's no legal definition that says that it's the CEO does answer to the shareholders and shareholders
[32:28.600 --> 32:33.720]  Do have a reasonable expectation that there that the company will be managed in a way that you know
[32:34.600 --> 32:36.600]  Doesn't devalue the company
[32:36.600 --> 32:45.880]  But that is it's sort of an 80s going forward justification for for the sort of logic that leads to the quarter by quarter
[32:46.120 --> 32:51.000]  You know to do whatever it takes. That's actually traditionally is not really the
[32:51.720 --> 32:58.520]  View of the CEO and I think Cook definitely has that old-school like he's thinking every bit as much about where Apple is going to be in
[32:58.600 --> 33:01.720]  25 30 years as he is where they're going to be next quarter
[33:01.720 --> 33:08.680]  And but anyway long story short though. I think nobody the thing that's different about Apple is there and and again
[33:08.680 --> 33:14.680]  You can be completely cynical about their their ruthless capitalism is their profit margins across the board
[33:15.160 --> 33:19.640]  But by focusing and maintaining these unprecedented
[33:20.280 --> 33:22.280]  30 to 35
[33:22.280 --> 33:24.280]  36 37% profit margins
[33:25.000 --> 33:25.880]  on
[33:25.880 --> 33:33.240]  With with average selling prices that are way above the competition. So they have higher margins and higher selling average selling prices
[33:33.560 --> 33:39.480]  For phones for laptops for desktops for definitely for the watches and definitely for watches
[33:41.160 --> 33:46.920]  That's what allows them to do things on their periphery that may not have an ROI, you know
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  It's it
[33:51.000 --> 33:57.080]  By focusing on and keeping these high profit margins and overall and incredible amounts of profit
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.280]  They don't have to do you know sweat the details on stuff like that like
[34:01.080 --> 34:03.880]  I don't think that they're reckless with their money at all
[34:03.880 --> 34:04.440]  If anything
[34:04.440 --> 34:08.440]  I think that they're still relatively conservative maybe even too conservative
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.480]  You know with their spending, but that's that's how you become so insanely profitable is by being conservative with your spending
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.720]  What was it last year? I thought I thought and and you know
[34:19.720 --> 34:27.480]  I don't mean I thought Tim Cook's too big move moments last year where when he his essay in business week
[34:27.480 --> 34:34.120]  Where he came out his gay, which was I thought very eloquent and just perfectly timed and absolutely and his
[34:35.160 --> 34:37.160]  downright angry
[34:37.160 --> 34:39.160]  Response at last year shareholder meeting
[34:39.800 --> 34:47.080]  Again, we're talking about return on investment with the the the conservative guy who was upset about their
[34:47.080 --> 34:49.400]  stance on global warming in that they're
[34:51.160 --> 34:55.880]  You know spending billions of dollars on solar power for their data centers
[34:55.880 --> 35:00.920]  And now they've announced a new thing where they're spending billions of dollars on solar power to power the campus
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.080]  You know, and he was upset about that like why are you wasting? How can you justify wasting shareholder money on on
[35:07.800 --> 35:12.200]  You know this theory that you know that the and cook this caught me
[35:12.200 --> 35:17.160]  He cook on anger. I've oh no. He did. Yeah. That was like though. That's the only time
[35:17.160 --> 35:23.000]  I thought that you've ever seen in public you've ever seen Tim Cook off message ever and not that he right
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.640]  I don't think he regrets it at all, but he really he got angry
[35:26.840 --> 35:28.200]  Kind of scary
[35:28.200 --> 35:31.400]  Yeah, yeah, I know I can I can't even imagine
[35:32.840 --> 35:34.520]  Because he's such a calm collected guy
[35:34.520 --> 35:37.720]  It's so different when somebody's bombastic you kind of expected from them
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.200]  But I think it was definitely a departure from the script and a departure from his his demeanor cracked a little bit
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.480]  And not necessarily a bad way, but just in a you know very human way, you know
[35:47.480 --> 35:53.880]  He felt very passionately about about that subject and I think that there's the cynicism as you mentioned
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.280]  It's good as a journalist. It's helpful to have cynicism a general overall
[35:59.080 --> 36:01.880]  Skepticism, but I think that the cynicism
[36:01.880 --> 36:09.240]  Towards technology and larger companies like Apple especially because of the the enormous amounts of power that they wield
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.560]  It has to be balanced right and I think that this
[36:14.280 --> 36:19.480]  These kinds of subjects where you're talking about a company like Apple saying we're gonna do this regardless of return
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.040]  There's a lot of
[36:22.040 --> 36:26.600]  Instinctual desire to paint that as a PR move or something like that and I
[36:26.600 --> 36:31.000]  I don't I don't hang out with him quick. We don't play golf. I don't know
[36:31.240 --> 36:37.400]  But it just doesn't feel it feels organic. It doesn't feel manufactured to me at all. Yeah, I agree. I thought
[36:38.680 --> 36:44.120]  With the sweater with the zip-up sweater that he had on he the word that came to mind was a
[36:44.840 --> 36:46.520]  vunkular
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.800]  It seems right he seems like he's sort of the company's uncle
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.600]  You know that everybody looks up to and you know
[36:52.600 --> 36:59.800]  He's not their executive team is pretty much around the same age. Everybody is sort of like 50 to 55
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.040]  It's not like he is older, but his hair is a little grayer than than most
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.960]  And so it does he sort of has like
[37:09.400 --> 37:12.600]  Elder statesman makes him seem old. It's not old, but there's sort of like
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.920]  I don't know and a sweater just sort of emphasized it. He's like the uncle that everybody looks up to
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.560]  Mm-hmm. I think there's a a power
[37:24.440 --> 37:27.960]  For him in feeling like he's collected
[37:28.280 --> 37:34.680]  You know the key has he's comfortable in the the power in the role that he's in because I think a lot of times
[37:34.680 --> 37:39.080]  You see these CEOs who obviously you and I both know over the past decade everybody has tried to
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.720]  replicate apples sort of we're actually going to bring the company
[37:44.280 --> 37:47.960]  Man out on stage and he's going to be convincing and they almost always fail
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.600]  But you see a lot of these guys come out and it feels very much like
[37:54.360 --> 37:56.360]  You know I got coached for
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.080]  Four weeks to deliver the speech and I'm delivering it, but you don't really believe any of that
[38:01.400 --> 38:07.800]  But he's feeling more more comfortable with the power that he wields and it seems like it's it's one of those things where
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.160]  He comes out. He's set his in control. He has this presence where
[38:13.160 --> 38:19.960]  You believe that he actually does have a handle on what's going on and Steve had that in a different way where
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.000]  You felt that the things he was saying reflected his passions and his passions drove the company
[38:25.400 --> 38:27.640]  Whereas it seems like the things that cook is saying
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.560]  Reflect the the passions of the people inside the company. Yeah, so it just seems like a little bit of a different balance there
[38:33.640 --> 38:35.640]  I think the single most
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.120]  important aspect of Tim Cook's
[38:38.120 --> 38:47.640]  Leadership of CEO and his person that that what made him so suited to take over when he did is that he truly seems
[38:48.600 --> 38:55.240]  Completely secure with the fact that he is in no way Steve Jobs and
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.880]  I think it's almost incredible like he's nowhere near
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.320]  He's very good. He's very smart. He's doing a great job. The company is incredibly successful
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.440]  So far under his leadership, but nobody is ever going to doubt nobody
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.000]  I don't think I mean I think you know the way things will play out like in the history of the industry
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.480]  He will not be as famous or revered or as you know
[39:21.480 --> 39:24.440]  Look back upon a hundred years from now as Steve Jobs
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.640]  Right Steve Jobs is Thomas Edison, you know, he's Henry Ford. He's you know, we're gonna be talking about him for long after
[39:31.880 --> 39:33.880]  You know, we're dead
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.400]  And he is totally secure in that he does doesn't bother him one bit
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.200]  He understands it. He knows it and he's fine with it. It doesn't bother him at all
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.440]  There's no part of his ego that is bothered by that
[39:47.080 --> 39:49.080]  And I think that is extraordinary
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.120]  And I think it's a true. It's just remarkable because I think that you know
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.080]  Almost anybody else who would have taken over it would have been inevitable that they'd it would it would eat at them
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.240]  Yep, yep, I agree. It takes a lot it takes a lot of comfort to not
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.640]  Put that it wasn't even that other people because other people are going to compare and do compared to him to Steve
[40:11.640 --> 40:14.040]  As far as management style or success or whatever
[40:14.520 --> 40:15.960]  But to not put that on yourself
[40:15.960 --> 40:18.680]  I mean, that's an insane thing and I'm sure you know
[40:18.680 --> 40:21.800]  He thinks about it a lot, but it doesn't seem like he lets it get in his way
[40:21.880 --> 40:28.120]  You know in some other universe where Steve either didn't get sick or or beat it and stayed ahead of it and had
[40:28.120 --> 40:34.040]  You know a full career and stayed at you know at the helm as CEO until he was you know 70 years old
[40:34.840 --> 40:36.840]  and it was a
[40:36.840 --> 40:38.200]  planned and obvious
[40:38.200 --> 40:40.440]  Transition and there was no tragedy involved
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.320]  There still would have had to been as somebody who followed Steve Jobs and it would have been hard
[40:45.720 --> 40:47.720]  But it's so much harder
[40:48.760 --> 40:56.680]  To do it like Tim Cook did in a way where everybody cook included wishes it had hadn't hadn't had to happen
[40:56.680 --> 40:58.680]  Right
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.160]  Yeah, it's just and I you know, it's been you know what three years
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.040]  Yeah, it's been like three and three years three and almost you know coming up on three and a half years
[41:11.080 --> 41:16.280]  It's you know it clearly feels like it's in the past tense that you know when Steve was around feels you know
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.600]  It's like this is Tim's apple, but I still feel like we we underestimate just
[41:21.480 --> 41:24.120]  What an extraordinary position that thrust him into
[41:24.120 --> 41:27.400]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, and and the
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.560]  They're in most transitions like this. There's a situation where you have a
[41:34.040 --> 41:37.960]  Clear-cut goal like oh, we need to fix this or fix that and
[41:38.760 --> 41:44.760]  The hardest position to come into as an incoming CEO is to not screw up something that's already
[41:45.240 --> 41:51.000]  Incredibly successful right exactly. That's the worst one. Right. You know, there's all kinds of other scenarios, but that's the oh man
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.440]  That's the worst because you're the only thing you could do if you are you are the best thing
[41:56.440 --> 41:58.440]  You're best person at your job ever
[41:58.440 --> 42:00.200]  You're just gonna give people going okay good
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.680]  You didn't screw it up and if you're the worst
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.840]  I mean this if you are you know, screw up even a little bit and things go downwards then it's
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.000]  You know, then you're the worst you're awful and you're horrible and everybody blames you
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.480]  So it's just the thing it was a thankless thing and I think he's handled it pretty well. Yeah
[42:16.440 --> 42:18.440]  I'm not saying I will do another break, but
[42:18.440 --> 42:23.720]  Jeff Williams first on stage appearance for research kit
[42:24.680 --> 42:31.000]  Well, I should say I've reword it was his first on stage appearance at a keynote and it was for research kit
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.240]  I think that's noteworthy. I think that there is a sort of implicit
[42:40.280 --> 42:46.720]  You know, there's a whole page of what a dozen doesn't plus senior executives at Apple that they listed as their senior leadership
[42:46.720 --> 42:53.440]  But the ones who speak on stage. I think there's an implicit, you know, they're the A team Shiller Federighi
[42:55.440 --> 42:58.880]  Johnny I've is an exception but he does you know, he does all these videos
[43:00.240 --> 43:06.480]  And I think Jeff Williams getting elevated to that level is a sign that he's leveled up within the company
[43:07.520 --> 43:13.040]  Yeah, there's a sort of line on the page and I don't want to have to read too much into the page layout
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.600]  Well, there's a sort of line and below it is Paul DeNev and Lisa Jackson and you know, Joe Padoni and then above that
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.920]  Jeff Williams is the last person above that
[43:21.920 --> 43:24.880]  No, but above that it's out of the order
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.360]  Right, right exactly and I think that he's definitely part of that group
[43:29.840 --> 43:35.200]  Obviously the people like Luca won't be on the stage necessarily because that's just not Apple's thing
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.000]  You know somebody like Dan I could see making an appearance maybe at some point
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.240]  Johnny obviously chooses not to as far as I have heard
[43:45.280 --> 43:48.480]  You know Bruce's GC so he's not really that's not his thing
[43:48.560 --> 43:54.320]  But among amongst that other group the only person that hasn't been on there that I think will eventually would be Angela
[43:54.320 --> 44:00.880]  Right, so I think that Jeff being in that group of people that presents is important and I also thought that
[44:01.440 --> 44:06.160]  Kevin Lynch coming out and he did actually a really good job. What we'll talk about was it wasn't yeah, I thought so too
[44:06.160 --> 44:10.320]  Yeah, but yeah, I Bruce saw as the general counsel
[44:10.320 --> 44:13.360]  I think if anybody went there as as the lawyer and said hey
[44:13.360 --> 44:16.080]  We want you to come out on stage and speak publicly. He'd be like fuck you
[44:17.040 --> 44:24.880]  I mean, I would advise you not to you just know that that guy is a stone cold killer. He's just he's a scary guy, you know
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.320]  I think that I
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.360]  As a you know spitball I predicted that maybe Angela aren't would appear on stage
[44:33.360 --> 44:36.960]  And then a lot of people wrote to me afterwards like oh, what do you think that she didn't know?
[44:36.960 --> 44:44.080]  I don't know but I think it's simple because they didn't have they didn't it was it my theory that maybe she would was tied to the
[44:44.080 --> 44:49.280]  Idea that they would talk about these the store retail changes that are coming
[44:51.040 --> 44:55.240]  All the head was a table with a glass top. She's gonna go on there and introduce a table with a glass top
[44:55.240 --> 44:57.200]  Yeah, you know, so yeah, I agree
[44:57.200 --> 45:00.640]  I think she would have been if they had something. I think she will eventually
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.680]  But I think that it would be in the context of retail
[45:06.400 --> 45:08.160]  It's you know, it's no hurt
[45:08.480 --> 45:10.960]  There's too many people who I think are reading into
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.680]  Her background and the fact that they're getting into watches and think that she's
[45:16.320 --> 45:23.120]  Doing product marketing or product development on watch and stuff like that like no her job is head retail and trust me
[45:23.120 --> 45:26.640]  Her hands are full like that's more than enough work for her to do
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.400]  So if she were to come on stage, it would be to talk about
[45:31.040 --> 45:34.800]  Retail it would not be to you know talk about watch features or something like that
[45:35.600 --> 45:40.240]  Yeah, when I when she got hired I did I finally published a piece that I've heard like
[45:40.560 --> 45:46.000]  Worked you up for months about it just before the event and then nobody probably nobody read it because of the event obviously but
[45:47.200 --> 45:51.680]  When she got hired I kind of asked around and you know it Apple a little bit just people I knew and said so what
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.240]  You know, you she can be involved in the watch because that's what a lot of people as you said a lot of people were
[45:56.240 --> 46:01.840]  Assuming oh, she's they're not just hiring her for retail. They're hiring her to to help develop the watch or you know
[46:01.840 --> 46:04.160]  Work on that that aspect of it and they said don't
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.040]  over estimate
[46:07.040 --> 46:09.040]  the amount of
[46:09.600 --> 46:13.040]  Involvement that that retail would have in product development
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.680]  You know, she's not sending in on on product
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.880]  Feature roundtables, you know, necessarily
[46:19.600 --> 46:25.520]  And I know I don't know this for sure obviously this is just people giving me general kind of hints of about how Apple works
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.760]  So I just yeah, she's not she's and definitely involved in the retail side of things
[46:29.760 --> 46:36.480]  Which I think there's plenty of work to do there. Yeah, I say this not to be dismissive as to her skills and abilities and taste
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.560]  I say this only knowing that
[46:38.880 --> 46:41.200]  Speaking of charge of retail for the
[46:41.760 --> 46:49.120]  most profitable per square foot retailer in the world who is expanding at a very
[46:49.120 --> 46:56.560]  Consistent not you know, not overly aggressive not reckless, but expanding and expanding in places as
[46:57.360 --> 46:59.360]  Politically delicate is China
[46:59.520 --> 47:02.640]  It's more than enough for her. It's a ton of work
[47:02.640 --> 47:06.960]  I'm sure that she is working her ass off every day and that just on the retail alone
[47:07.200 --> 47:10.560]  But I think that you know when if and when we see her on stage, it'll be in that context
[47:10.560 --> 47:18.880]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at Harries
[47:19.360 --> 47:21.360]  Harries makes premium
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.840]  Men's shaving goods. They make razors. They make blades
[47:26.960 --> 47:29.680]  They make shaving cream and gel. They have aftershave
[47:30.480 --> 47:37.040]  Everything you need to take care of your shaving needs and they do it right. It's top quality stuff and
[47:37.040 --> 47:44.640]  At a great price really truly go to Amazon measured against the stuff from Gillette about half the price
[47:45.440 --> 47:52.720]  Of the major big brand competitors for blades. How do they do it? Well, they do it by cutting out the middle man
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.400]  Cutting out the advertising and by taking control themselves
[47:57.600 --> 48:03.760]  They bought their own factory in Germany that makes razor blades a factory that was already doing it. They bought it
[48:03.760 --> 48:09.760]  They make their own blades. They are top notch super sharp really high quality
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.120]  They're not just like a company that has a cool brand and they white label the blades from you know
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.000]  Whatever factory anywhere in the world. No, they make their own blades really great stuff
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.760]  They make their own handles. They're really great design. It doesn't look like the
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.240]  Lingi crap that you get from Gillette or shik or those guys
[48:28.640 --> 48:30.640]  Stuff that looks like you buy it now and
[48:30.640 --> 48:36.560]  30 40 years from now. It's going to look exactly the same when you buy another one from Harry's because it's just a simple plain timeless
[48:36.880 --> 48:38.560]  classy design
[48:38.560 --> 48:44.160]  And all the details are right you pick up the handle. It just feels good in your hand. It's like a nice solid
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.400]  Just a nice solid thing
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.840]  Really almost Apple like in terms of just caring about how something feels like the heft of it
[48:52.560 --> 48:54.900]  And really really great prices
[48:54.900 --> 49:04.020]  Where do you go to find out more go to Harry's dot com h a r r y s dot com
[49:05.700 --> 49:06.900]  And
[49:06.900 --> 49:08.900]  When you buy something
[49:08.900 --> 49:14.900]  Use this code talk show they don't put the gun that it's just talk show use that code and you'll save
[49:14.900 --> 49:20.740]  I think five bucks off your first order. You'll save something if you've never bought anything from Harry's before use that code and
[49:20.740 --> 49:25.220]  You'll save a couple bucks and their starter kit is only like 15 bucks
[49:25.300 --> 49:29.860]  So you can get started with that code you get started for like 10 bucks. You'll get a handle three blades
[49:31.060 --> 49:33.060]  Really nice packaging
[49:33.700 --> 49:37.860]  Really you're you're I hate to say it, but you're stupid if you don't take them up on it. It's a great deal
[49:38.260 --> 49:41.780]  So my thanks to Harry's I actually use their stuff. It's great right?
[49:42.500 --> 49:45.540]  Yeah, it's pretty solid. I mean I I tried it on kind of a whim
[49:45.540 --> 49:50.260]  I first heard about them and I've been using represent it took me a while to use to the angle of the blades
[49:50.580 --> 49:54.020]  It's like really flat in comparison to like a Gillette turbo
[49:54.340 --> 49:59.380]  Whatever, you know with the 18 blades on it that strips your skin from your flesh. Yeah, I think I know what you mean
[49:59.380 --> 50:02.020]  I do know what you mean where it is sort of more of a
[50:02.580 --> 50:05.540]  Yeah, it's like a yeah, like a flat. Yeah, flat to go way to put
[50:06.660 --> 50:12.260]  But yeah, works well. Yeah, really great stuff back to the event. So after Jeff Williams and research kit
[50:12.260 --> 50:18.100]  And it was the new MacBook and at this point to me
[50:19.220 --> 50:24.900]  To me it's almost like it was like two events because this to me was just pure Apple, right?
[50:24.900 --> 50:30.180]  And it's like and Shiller does this stuff great. I know there's some people who think that he is
[50:30.500 --> 50:34.100]  I don't know what people say so people some people think he's a little like
[50:34.980 --> 50:38.340]  Not flat, but that he's he's like unenthusiastic
[50:38.340 --> 50:43.380]  On stage. I think that he's got the I think he's got this stuff down so cold
[50:43.540 --> 50:46.500]  He's so good. I think he's their best presenter by far
[50:47.620 --> 50:49.620]  And he does it. Yeah
[50:49.860 --> 50:54.420]  He just knows how to do it and it's just it was just such a typical Apple product introduction
[50:55.780 --> 50:59.620]  I thought it was really and I think he understands the stuff, right? Yeah, so I
[51:00.020 --> 51:06.740]  Think that's the difference between like a presenter and somebody who goes out there and and happens to present this thing that they've been working on
[51:06.740 --> 51:10.980]  And obviously he doesn't do heartbreak is marketing, but still he just get he understands
[51:11.140 --> 51:18.100]  Holistically what makes it special and he's trying to he's trying to really just tell you why that's the field that you get
[51:18.100 --> 51:21.300]  I think when he goes I think it's genuine and I've said before like
[51:22.100 --> 51:28.420]  That's how product marketing works at Apple like it's not like somebody like Johnny Ives team comes up with the design
[51:28.420 --> 51:33.220]  And they work out the engineering and then they make it and then they come to Shiller's team and say here
[51:33.220 --> 51:39.540]  Here's the new MacBook figure out a way to sell it like Shiller and his team are involved right from the get-go in
[51:40.020 --> 51:42.980]  terms of the product development like they're involved at the
[51:44.100 --> 51:46.100]  beginning like it's
[51:46.100 --> 51:48.420]  It's not here's the thing figure out a way to sell it
[51:48.420 --> 51:54.260]  It's what should the thing be and then all we have to do is tell people what it is and why like I said and why
[51:55.300 --> 52:02.660]  right and and I mean that that's it's typified by this section where they spent like three four minutes talking about
[52:02.660 --> 52:06.180]  Keyports, which is right. Yeah, like you tell any other marketing head
[52:06.340 --> 52:12.100]  Hey, we changed the keyboards, which is in this it took us like two years to research it and and build the or however long and
[52:12.340 --> 52:16.740]  Research and build these keyboards, which is there like yeah, okay. I'll see if I can sneak it in
[52:16.980 --> 52:22.500]  You know, but no he knows why he knows the amount of effort they spent on it and he knows why it's so important
[52:22.820 --> 52:26.820]  And he also knows that when Apple announces something like this it actually
[52:27.700 --> 52:29.780]  He has to impress upon people that they really
[52:29.780 --> 52:35.060]  Really thought about it. They mean there's no other way. It just to say we really thought hard about it
[52:35.060 --> 52:37.060]  They made like a Hollywood caliber
[52:37.380 --> 52:42.500]  Slow-mo video showing how the keys work in action. It's yeah
[52:43.060 --> 52:46.340]  I'm I guarantee you they shot that with a phantom right with one of those
[52:46.580 --> 52:52.260]  Yeah, 20,000 frames per second. Yeah, you know cameras. Yeah, I definitely think they might have
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.300]  Uh
[52:55.300 --> 52:58.420]  What do you think about the MacBook? I mean overall impressions. It's pretty good
[52:58.420 --> 53:01.300]  You know, and I dicked around with it at the event a little bit afterwards
[53:01.300 --> 53:05.300]  But I think that on stage when I was watching it I started mentally
[53:05.780 --> 53:11.860]  Telling the amount of major inventions that went into the one device because usually with Apple
[53:12.420 --> 53:16.660]  There will be a lot of refinements and a lot of iterative changes that they make to something
[53:16.900 --> 53:18.900]  And of course each one of those involves
[53:19.140 --> 53:26.100]  Experimentation maybe invention and that kind of thing but the MacBook especially this time around there were they were like five major
[53:26.100 --> 53:31.300]  inventions that you know things that had to be created not just
[53:32.100 --> 53:37.300]  Bought and are licensed and applied but actually created to make this thing work
[53:37.300 --> 53:42.980]  Well, that's a list of them. Okay. Okay. So you've got the batteries right a change in batteries
[53:43.780 --> 53:47.140]  It'll do a overview so change in batteries touch pad
[53:48.260 --> 53:49.380]  the
[53:49.380 --> 53:53.780]  Screen right this is a change in the screen the keyboard switches
[53:53.780 --> 53:55.780]  and
[53:55.780 --> 54:01.300]  Then the well, I guess USB-C is really under adoption right because they're adopting a standard well
[54:01.300 --> 54:05.620]  Here's about that. I have heard I keep you know
[54:05.780 --> 54:14.500]  Can't say who but let's call them informed little birdies that USB-C is an Apple invention and that they gave it to the standard bodies
[54:16.020 --> 54:21.620]  And that wouldn't surprise me too much that the politics of such is that they can't really say that
[54:21.620 --> 54:26.260]  They they're not going to come out in public and say that but that they did
[54:26.900 --> 54:31.940]  It is an Apple invention and they do they want it to become a standard. You know, that's like the difference like
[54:32.740 --> 54:34.740]  And you know, we can get into this. It's a good question
[54:34.740 --> 54:40.900]  We should definitely come back to is are they going to use USB-C instead of lightning on iOS devices or something
[54:41.220 --> 54:47.780]  But I feel like the difference is there are certain devices and contexts where they want to have a proprietary port
[54:47.780 --> 54:53.300]  And there are other contexts where they want to have an industry standard port
[54:53.620 --> 54:58.740]  You know, they want your MacBook to be able to connect to third-party displays
[54:58.740 --> 55:04.820]  Sure, they want you to buy an Apple display, but they know that you know that it that it has to be able to support third-party displays
[55:05.140 --> 55:12.020]  They want you to be able to plug in a microphone, you know for podcasting into your MacBook
[55:12.020 --> 55:17.300]  And they're not going to make microphones, right? So they want it to be an open port
[55:18.100 --> 55:21.700]  And so you know, but they also want it to be obviously thin
[55:22.500 --> 55:24.340]  And they also want it to be
[55:25.380 --> 55:28.580]  Upside-downable. I don't know what you would call. Yeah, we're first of all. I guess
[55:29.060 --> 55:32.340]  Yeah, and so they you know what I've heard is that it's pretty
[55:32.340 --> 55:35.140]  You know, it's an Apple invention that was sort of developed coincident
[55:35.140 --> 55:39.060]  You know alongside lightning and that they donated they gave to the standard's bodies
[55:39.060 --> 55:42.340]  So because they wanted to you know, they want interesting. They want the open
[55:42.340 --> 55:46.580]  They want the industry standard to be thin enough for their devices and they want it to be
[55:47.060 --> 55:48.500]  reversible
[55:48.500 --> 55:52.820]  Right, I mean that makes some sense. I mean the the the one thing that I
[55:53.860 --> 55:57.620]  That made me sad about it is the apparent death of MagSafe
[55:57.940 --> 56:02.340]  Yeah, that's I had I'm not going to take credit for this a former Apple or told me this
[56:02.340 --> 56:04.980]  But he said that he felt that the MagSafe was
[56:04.980 --> 56:12.740]  Like the the hallmark Apple invention of the 2000s. Yeah, you know, and that it was a very Apple thing to do and
[56:13.780 --> 56:17.940]  That you know, I mean you think about the amount of time that they spent
[56:18.500 --> 56:20.500]  Panting that they patented it so hard
[56:21.060 --> 56:24.580]  So hardcore that people couldn't even make anything like it
[56:24.820 --> 56:27.620]  Like everybody else has had to be pretty awful in comparison
[56:28.180 --> 56:32.660]  And I think that there's a plus and a minus to that the minus is that I wish all computers had that
[56:32.660 --> 56:37.940]  But they couldn't because Apple patented it, but the plus is that it worked really well and Apple computers
[56:38.020 --> 56:41.220]  You know, which is what I primarily use it for like laptops and stuff
[56:41.700 --> 56:43.860]  But I'm pretty sad to see that go. I'm gonna be honest
[56:43.860 --> 56:46.580]  I'm kind of nostalgic for the MadSafe. I'm actually already. It's funny
[56:46.580 --> 56:48.580]  And we you know, we have to mention that
[56:49.620 --> 56:57.300]  The Mark German at nine to five Mac. What was it about six weeks ago when he came out with the you know, here's the next MacBook Air
[56:57.300 --> 57:03.460]  And you know add they they'd they'd commissioned an artist to do
[57:03.940 --> 57:09.060]  You know renderings based on what he was told and it was spot on nailed it. Yeah, really close
[57:09.060 --> 57:13.140]  And I mean there was a little the little tiny details wrong
[57:13.140 --> 57:16.580]  But I almost think it wasn't even I think it was just like a mistake on the artist part
[57:16.580 --> 57:21.380]  For example, the escape key was an the renderings was top right instead of top left
[57:21.780 --> 57:26.500]  Which made no sense at all like why if if there's room for the key period? Why no world would you move?
[57:26.500 --> 57:29.300]  And I think it was just a mistake on the artist part
[57:29.300 --> 57:32.100]  I don't think that like it was a botched part of this thing
[57:32.100 --> 57:36.020]  I think that artists just wasn't thinking and put the escape key up there who you know who cares
[57:36.100 --> 57:38.100]  But in terms of only having
[57:38.100 --> 57:45.060]  One USB-C port on the left and a microphone port on the right and no other port's period that nailed it or
[57:45.060 --> 57:47.620]  Or not a microphone a headphone jack
[57:48.500 --> 57:50.500]  Yeah, it's a line in and out by the way
[57:50.740 --> 57:55.380]  So it is if that is odd in an audio in jack as well as a headphone jack. Oh interesting
[57:55.380 --> 58:00.100]  Um, and in in reaction to that the the you know the the
[58:01.460 --> 58:05.380]  Conventional wisdom the general consensus was well, how can you do that?
[58:05.380 --> 58:08.580]  How can you get rid of magsafe if you can't get rid of magsafe magsafe magsafe is awesome?
[58:09.300 --> 58:13.140]  And you know it doesn't make it so therefore this can't be true. This has to be a mistake
[58:13.620 --> 58:20.580]  I think you know a lot of times you just you have to realize that in the name of progress apples answer is you know tough
[58:20.580 --> 58:26.820]  All right because we spit we spit billions of dollars developing this and we're gonna kill it just because
[58:27.380 --> 58:32.260]  It's not necessary and it's always you know it's it to me. It's a good sign
[58:33.140 --> 58:36.420]  That I don't want to buy this laptop. I mean, I mean, I mean to I'll just say flat out
[58:36.420 --> 58:38.420]  I do not want this machine right now
[58:39.060 --> 58:45.060]  Um, but I like it as a statement as to where things are going and I definitely can imagine buying
[58:45.060 --> 58:51.300]  A laptop a new MacBook in its image and you know next time I buy one in a couple years
[58:52.020 --> 58:55.700]  Um, but I'm reminded of every time apple has dropped something like this
[58:55.700 --> 59:00.980]  You know like with the original iMac dropping everything except USB and people say well
[59:00.980 --> 59:04.180]  It's not going to work with any of my existing peripherals
[59:04.580 --> 59:09.780]  None of my peripherals will work none of my mice or keyboards or hard drives are going to work and the answer is tough
[59:09.780 --> 59:15.300]  You know and when they drop the optical when they drop the optical drive with
[59:16.020 --> 59:21.460]  The first MacBook Air and I think that's the the real comparison is to the first MacBook Air people are like well
[59:21.700 --> 59:27.780]  It's not going to play any of DVDs. It's not how am I going to install the OS OS updates come on
[59:28.420 --> 59:32.340]  DVDs and the answer was tough and you know we'll figure it out
[59:33.380 --> 59:36.580]  Yeah, we'll figure out at some point. It's I joked on Twitter
[59:36.580 --> 59:40.100]  It's like, you know, they're they're the Apple outrages
[59:40.420 --> 59:44.740]  Outrage cycle is essentially Apple predicts the future executes. It's a little bit
[59:45.540 --> 59:51.060]  You could even use the phrase a little bit too early right or a little bit earlier than the rest of the industry is really what that means
[59:51.380 --> 59:58.500]  And then everybody gets pissed and then eventually it's a standard and I think that Jason Snell wrote a review of the original MacBook
[59:58.660 --> 1:00:02.420]  He linked it on Twitter today. I was talking with Steven Sonofsky on Twitter about
[1:00:02.420 --> 1:00:08.580]  The the whole original MacBook review that Jason wrote and Jason chimed in and he had referred to it
[1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:14.900]  I guess a couple weeks ago, but it was essentially the same thing. It's like man. This is you know a big change and it's
[1:00:15.540 --> 1:00:20.660]  There's a lot of compromises and etc. Etc. And you know, it's all over again
[1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.660]  It's the same concept
[1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:25.620]  And and yet here we are with our air is going
[1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:29.220]  Oh, how I could ever live without my air at my air is just fine, you know
[1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:34.180]  So well, I remember too when german's report first came out with this and most people are like
[1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:38.020]  Well, there's no way they're gonna drop MagSafe because MagSafe is awesome and useful
[1:00:38.020 --> 1:00:42.420]  And then there were others the people who were ends up were right who said well
[1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:45.620]  iPad doesn't have MagSafe
[1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:50.420]  Yeah, I
[1:00:50.420 --> 1:00:51.460]  Don't buy that though
[1:00:51.460 --> 1:00:57.060]  That that to me is a straw man because the iPad is not used anywhere near like an laptop is used
[1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:04.420]  You know some people are we are already telling me, you know, I I've ever we have a really hard time buying this laptop because I have small children
[1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:08.740]  You know and they run by my desk and kick the kick the wire and everything and I totally
[1:01:08.740 --> 1:01:11.220]  I agree with that and not only that remember this thing is light
[1:01:11.380 --> 1:01:14.660]  Yeah, it's super light so if you kick that cord on there's any resistance
[1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:17.540]  It's gonna go flying and yeah, there's no moving parts anymore
[1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:20.740]  So theoretically speaking it's gonna be better off than a hard drive
[1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:23.700]  But still that's that that kind of sucks
[1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:27.860]  And I wish that they would have found a way to maybe integrate MagSafe into
[1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:30.100]  their USB-C in other words
[1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:33.700]  There's a general USB-C you can plug a USB-C cable into this without the MagSafe
[1:01:34.340 --> 1:01:40.900]  But ours has this really cool, you know polarized magnet that auto centers and clicks it
[1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:43.620]  Yeah, my thought was maybe they would put it on the adapter
[1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:48.420]  You know that the wall, you know the thing that you plug in oh, yeah, they did they didn't you know
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:52.340]  It's not it is you know as far as I can tell it is the case
[1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:56.580]  Now that it back to where we were where if somebody kicks your table kicks your cable
[1:01:56.980 --> 1:02:01.620]  Trips over your table cable while it's connected. You're your the MacBook is gonna go
[1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:07.300]  Right, so that is yeah, I don't know Apple care plus I guess I guess you know
[1:02:07.300 --> 1:02:10.260]  I guess you know I do think I honestly think that that's a
[1:02:11.460 --> 1:02:14.660]  Probably more than anything. I mean there's a performance angle too
[1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:19.460]  We're clearly performance wise. This is not a MacBook Pro. I mean so if you're doing serious
[1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:21.460]  performance
[1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:30.580]  You know heavy stuff compiling stuff with Xcode or something or doing, you know video editing or anything that might strain your your computer
[1:02:31.460 --> 1:02:37.540]  No, you probably still want a MacBook Pro, but in terms of right clearly this is position more against the errors than the pros
[1:02:37.860 --> 1:02:40.900]  Not price wise, but for sure and so for sure, you know use case scenario
[1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:48.100]  I would say the number one which one should you get question is how often do you use your laptop?
[1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:50.100]  While it's plugged in
[1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:55.780]  You know I cuz I do think I think the comparison to an iPad is apt. I think that's why they've done it
[1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:59.620]  It's oh, I see what you're saying with that. Yeah, and yeah
[1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:04.420]  I get it their answer to why isn't there a max if on this and I'm not putting words in their mouth
[1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:08.660]  But the general answer would seem to me is you don't plug this thing in right? You don't use it plugged in
[1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:13.100]  So let's say you're a college student and you're you don't even take your adapter with you
[1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:19.580]  You keep it in your dorm room and you in the morning you leave your dorm room with a fully charged MacBook Air and
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:22.220]  You don't plug it in again until you
[1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:26.620]  Come back from classes at the end of the afternoon. It doesn't matter right?
[1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:31.980]  I think there's a lot of people who use them in that context. I know in our context though like the
[1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:35.100]  You know with the MacBook Air as the sort of default
[1:03:36.220 --> 1:03:37.740]  reporters
[1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:43.020]  Laptop I mean I mean it's not even sort of I mean it's infamous no it is yeah
[1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:49.380]  Because even you know people even take pictures at like Microsoft events and you take a look at the press and it's all these Apple logos lit up
[1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.020]  It's but they're you know
[1:03:54.860 --> 1:03:59.820]  We need plugs though because we're using them so so much, you know, we're yeah
[1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:06.460]  You're using the the wireless network which is typically crushed and so it's harder for the radio the work radio is working harder
[1:04:06.460 --> 1:04:08.460]  I will say this though
[1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:14.540]  Battery-wise I could tell you when it changed for me this latest the latest MacBook that I have is a
[1:04:15.900 --> 1:04:17.900]  2013 model and
[1:04:18.620 --> 1:04:21.580]  That MacBook changed everything for me the air
[1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:26.700]  As far as battery goes. I don't really plug in or worry about plugs at events anymore
[1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:29.420]  As I remember I was covering WWDC in
[1:04:30.860 --> 1:04:32.860]  2012 or maybe
[1:04:32.860 --> 1:04:39.500]  2013 I can't remember what any I was like a 2011 MacBook right and I knew for a fact that that thing was not going to last all the way through and
[1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:44.140]  I was covering it at a time when I wasn't invited to any Apple events
[1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:50.780]  So I just got in line with everybody else and you know covered it from the crowd from way back in the crowd or whatever and did a whole
[1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:56.940]  Live blog thing and my battery ran out with about 10 minutes left. It was the it was the one where they were doing maps
[1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:02.460]  It was the one where they're introducing Apple maps and my battery ran right before it started
[1:05:02.460 --> 1:05:09.540]  Just a couple of apps. It's a head to plug the rest of from my phone. I was essentially a nightmare. It was a WWE DC
[1:05:09.540 --> 1:05:11.780]  Yeah, it was a force or stall introduction
[1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:19.900]  Exactly. Yeah, and so if my battery just went and I knew it was going obviously and there was no plugs because they only provide plugs for the
[1:05:19.900 --> 1:05:25.900]  Reporters in their special, you know section up front and so they don't provide plugs for anybody else because they're supposed to be sitting there watching
[1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:27.900]  Maybe I've never got my plug. I
[1:05:27.900 --> 1:05:33.900]  I think that's news to me that there's plugs up front. I don't know. Yeah, there are plugs up there
[1:05:33.900 --> 1:05:36.780]  You got a fight for him everybody everybody jostles for them
[1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:40.540]  But yeah, I remember getting the new one and
[1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:46.340]  From that point on I have no longer worried about it and that's it and as you mentioned that's an intense scenario, right?
[1:05:46.900 --> 1:05:50.540]  You know hardcore wireless network your posting pictures your downloading stuff
[1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:54.260]  You maybe even tethering and so your phone is charging off of your laptop
[1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:58.020]  You know all of this stuff and never never have a had a problem, you know
[1:05:58.020 --> 1:06:00.340]  I think that it's it was a significant difference
[1:06:00.340 --> 1:06:05.300]  So that means with this new one, you know, we're taking a step back a little bit
[1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:09.460]  Power-wise, but battery-wise. I think we actually may be in the same ballpark
[1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:16.100]  So it may be one of the scenarios where you can get through events and things and your day even without having to
[1:06:16.100 --> 1:06:23.300]  Yeah, I'm with you there like I might my laptop for years was a March 2011 11 inch air
[1:06:23.860 --> 1:06:29.460]  And I've said this on the show many times it was the last air before the 11 inch got the light-up keyboard
[1:06:29.540 --> 1:06:34.020]  So I had the the last 11 inch air that had a not lit-up keyboard
[1:06:34.740 --> 1:06:38.340]  And it was great and it was you know so light and portable, but you know
[1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:44.260]  The battery life was sort of a struggle on days like a WWE and I don't even I don't even use it during the key notes
[1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:47.380]  I don't even do live blogging during the key notes, but just you know
[1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:54.180]  Trying to follow along with the news read all the stuff after the event and like you said
[1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:58.180]  I think that the fact that the the cellular and Wi-Fi networks are always
[1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:02.580]  You know under an avalanche makes the antenna struggle
[1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:06.020]  But the big thing for me was always to get through a day like that
[1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:09.540]  I would turn the brightness all the way down as low as I could still read it
[1:07:09.540 --> 1:07:15.700]  It was the display and you're craning towards the screen. Yeah, and so last year late in the year
[1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:17.060]  I bought
[1:07:17.060 --> 1:07:25.140]  Sadly now one generation behind the 13 inch MacBook Pro instead of an air because I was sick of the I don't care about the weight
[1:07:25.140 --> 1:07:26.740]  I just wanted a better machine
[1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:29.060]  And I have to say I'm with you the battery life now
[1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:33.460]  I've I don't know that I've ever even gone into the red. I don't think I've even gone to 20%
[1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:36.660]  It's easy to go very very rarely
[1:07:36.660 --> 1:07:41.380]  I mean the only time it happens is because I think I overestimate health how
[1:07:42.260 --> 1:07:46.260]  Far I can take it, you know, I won't charge it for two or three days or something like that
[1:07:46.260 --> 1:07:47.620]  I'll be like oh, it's low
[1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:50.420]  But yeah, very very rarely do I ever run up against anymore
[1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:54.500]  I think they they finally cross that threshold and like no it's not sad
[1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:59.060]  But the this the funny thing about this is that we all complain about battery life
[1:07:59.460 --> 1:08:03.460]  Until it's good enough and then it everybody just stops talking about it
[1:08:03.460 --> 1:08:07.540]  So you never really know when that threshold was crossed. You kind of have to think back
[1:08:07.540 --> 1:08:09.540]  Like when did I stop complaining?
[1:08:09.540 --> 1:08:15.540]  Yeah, and I think that that's that's it we crossed that Rubicon with this like 2013 air
[1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:21.700]  Yeah, and one of the things about the new MacBook that really stood out to me was when Shuler said that with the new screen
[1:08:21.700 --> 1:08:26.900]  Technology that it's a 30% reduction in power draw for the same brightness level
[1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:30.500]  That's huge. That's a huge step up and like I said
[1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:37.140]  The number one thing that I used to do first thing I did to if I knew I was gonna have a stressful day on the battery
[1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:40.500]  It was turned to brightness down, you know, the screen is still and it's you know
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:45.540]  It's true for phones. It's true for everything screens are huge power draws and
[1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:51.540]  Going retina only you know across the board only makes it worse because you know
[1:08:51.540 --> 1:08:55.380]  It's it's not just the dimensions the size. It's the number of pixels
[1:08:55.380 --> 1:09:03.860]  Um, so a 30% reduction in power draw for the display to me like you said and listing your five
[1:09:03.860 --> 1:09:06.740]  I think your five inventions are all spot on it's essential
[1:09:06.740 --> 1:09:09.220]  There's no way they could do this MacBook without that
[1:09:09.940 --> 1:09:13.540]  Because we'd only be because you're talking about six hours of battery life
[1:09:13.540 --> 1:09:17.940]  And that's that's like a spec from 10 years ago, you know, you can't do six hours of battery life
[1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:20.580]  And I think it I mean
[1:09:20.580 --> 1:09:21.620]  I don't know if it is
[1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:25.620]  But it seems like it's exo to me and I think that's where they got their reduction
[1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:29.060]  I haven't done any research into whether it is or not. So please don't kill me if it's not
[1:09:29.060 --> 1:09:34.100]  But I think that it it might be an exo display, which obviously the biggest
[1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:36.660]  pro to those is
[1:09:37.380 --> 1:09:43.540]  Battery life and the fact that they had to do all of this really really fancy dancing with the battery
[1:09:43.540 --> 1:09:46.980]  And the size of the logic board to fit more battery and etc etc
[1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:51.700]  And then get a screen with 30% less battery says a lot about the crappy
[1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:59.460]  Nature of battery technology as it stands right now. So they they're still I like to call it like they're
[1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:02.340]  the stop gaps right like so
[1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:07.700]  The increase in efficiency of a processor increase in power efficiency of the screen
[1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:13.460]  Massive amount more battery inside due to the smaller logic board and this fancy layering technology
[1:10:13.460 --> 1:10:20.340]  All of that is just compensating for the fact that the physical limitations of battery chemistry
[1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:26.740]  Are everybody's running up against that Apple inclusion. Yeah, it's totally great. Look to me like the new logic board was about the size of an iPhone
[1:10:27.620 --> 1:10:31.620]  This is crazy. Yeah, I actually saw an article today. Somebody did some math
[1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:34.820]  Can't remember where it was digit times or something
[1:10:34.820 --> 1:10:41.700]  But you know somebody did them did the math on the size of the logic board is actually smaller surface area wise than a raspberry pie
[1:10:41.700 --> 1:10:48.660]  Like every show raspberry pie. That's crazy. It'll be it'll be interesting to see
[1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:51.540]  whether this is
[1:10:51.780 --> 1:10:53.620]  something that
[1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:55.620]  Competition can copy or not
[1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:57.860]  You know in terms of
[1:10:58.740 --> 1:11:04.740]  You know, and I've meaning to write an article that would I got went to the working headline Apple semi-conductor
[1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:07.140]  You know that that it
[1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:11.220]  If I had a consumer you don't need to worry about it, but if someone who follows the industry
[1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:19.060]  You really have to look at Apple now as one of the leading semi-conductor companies if not the leading semi-conductor company in the world
[1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:21.540]  You know right there with Intel Qualcomm
[1:11:22.180 --> 1:11:29.580]  Samsung whoever else, you know, and I and mostly though that's been in the context of iOS devices and the watch
[1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:38.300]  Right with the s1 where you've got a five caliber performance supposedly on this tiny thing on your wrist and with the
[1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:45.820]  You know the a series systems on a chip for the iOS devices, but now I that's one of the things that struck me about this device
[1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:49.340]  Is maybe I don't know enough about the industry
[1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:54.140]  But maybe this logic board reduction is something that is every bit as cutting edge
[1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:58.620]  Engineering-wise as the iOS systems on a chip
[1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:04.700]  Yeah, I don't know anything. I mean not anything, but I don't know enough about it either to make that judgment
[1:12:04.860 --> 1:12:10.780]  So I don't want to blow it out of proportion or anything, but it seems I mean that's a pretty distinct if you've ever seen a logic board in
[1:12:10.780 --> 1:12:16.620]  Another MacBook. It's you know, it's double size. I mean, it's pretty big. So they're they have a almost double size
[1:12:16.860 --> 1:12:21.900]  So they have a they put a lot of effort into increasing the density of that board
[1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:26.860]  In order to fit more battery in there and it very well could be something really really fancy. They did there
[1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:30.540]  Yeah, one of the little things I noticed I haven't seen a lot of people talking about it
[1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:36.220]  But I'm curious about it really curious and I know you are very very kind of mean you were welcoming my
[1:12:37.740 --> 1:12:41.980]  Questions I texted you of questions if you could ask people, you know Apple reps
[1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:45.660]  Yeah, it's all like I was busy or anything live blogging John. It's no problem
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:51.660]  I believe it's always the case though even when I'm at the event always
[1:12:51.900 --> 1:12:58.940]  Inevitably the moment I step foot past the threshold where I could go back and ask another question
[1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:01.740]  Always come up with my best question
[1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:07.900]  Sure, and it was exactly it was like I don't know like two hours after the event was over popped into my head
[1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:12.300]  Why did they put the word MacBook on the front of the glass of the display again?
[1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:20.620]  That is actually a really good question. I loved it. Why didn't you ask me that earlier when I got I love that my
[1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:28.380]  You know this MacBook Pro doesn't say anything like an iPhone like the way that your iPhone does not say iPhone in front of it
[1:13:28.940 --> 1:13:31.500]  I don't understand why they put the word MacBook there
[1:13:32.860 --> 1:13:35.180]  I wish I could ask I actually didn't even
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:41.900]  I didn't even think about that until now. It seems kind of ghost doesn't it? Yeah, yeah, it seems you know
[1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.140]  Like of course it's a MacBook. I know what I'm using
[1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:49.260]  I think that that's why they never had it on the front of the iPhone right right and I I early on
[1:13:49.260 --> 1:13:51.260]  I made fun of other phones
[1:13:51.740 --> 1:13:52.540]  like
[1:13:52.540 --> 1:13:59.580]  You know the Motorola droid max razor or whatever for like pasting the logo several times on the front and back of the phone
[1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:06.060]  Because it's like yeah, we got it. We bought it like we're we already got our money. Why are you I've always streaming it in my face
[1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:12.140]  I've always I've noticed thought it was so curious that all the things that
[1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:18.700]  Competitors copy about and like let's take Samsung in particular all the ways that Samsung has copied Apple designs
[1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:24.620]  One thing they could copy and could not be held accountable for it would be to copy the logo list
[1:14:25.420 --> 1:14:28.940]  Front face and they can't bring themselves to do it
[1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:35.740]  They have to print they've they're compelled to print the ugly Samsung logo on every phone
[1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:40.380]  They make even though if they wanted to clearly you can't copyright not putting a logo on the front face
[1:14:40.380 --> 1:14:44.460]  So they could make a plain black or plain white face that would look more like an iPhone
[1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:51.740]  But they can't bring themselves to do it. I would just imagine like a design review meeting where some designer
[1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:56.460]  You know in their in their laboratory has gone through and said oh man
[1:14:56.700 --> 1:15:02.380]  This is a great piece of Apple design here not putting it on the front and they remove it and everything and it's a very last
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:08.300]  Second before it goes to production some exact walks by and says why there's no Samsung logo on the front of this
[1:15:08.780 --> 1:15:13.180]  Please put a Samsung logo on the front of this and then the engineer just slumps and defeat and make it big
[1:15:14.380 --> 1:15:18.700]  Yeah, make it big make it reflective make it metallic because they are always metallic
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:22.780]  Like like you look at the front of the phone and you move it back and forth and it shines in your eyes
[1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:26.460]  You're like really come on now, but yeah, I don't know. I don't know why it's on there
[1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:27.660]  Um
[1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:31.500]  I don't and you notice I don't know if you notice this or took note of it
[1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:36.220]  But the the logo is no longer backlit right so it's polished
[1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:39.260]  I didn't know exactly that MacBook. I thought about that when I said I thought about that
[1:15:39.260 --> 1:15:44.060]  Just when I said a few minutes ago that we're like gonna add a Microsoft event you look and you see all these lit up Apple logos
[1:15:44.220 --> 1:15:47.500]  Um, yeah, I think it's probably just a thinness issue
[1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:53.500]  I think sure. I think that it there's just they you know maybe even power. Yeah, maybe
[1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.180]  Yeah, but yeah, thinness. I think it's probably it. I mean that thing is
[1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:00.220]  Really really thin like when you look at it in a person
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:05.660]  It's I mean pictures always make things look thicker like the watch what we'll talk about that but the the
[1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:11.180]  The lid is really really thin and they had to layer that screen precisely to get it in there
[1:16:11.740 --> 1:16:14.060]  Yeah, I just think it's a thickness thing. Yeah, the other thing
[1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:16.860]  It's kind of sad but a little bit, but I'm not surprised
[1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:23.740]  I've sort of been thinking that they were heading that direction ever since the iPad shipped without a light-up logo ever since
[1:16:23.820 --> 1:16:26.140]  I've always thought it's you know, it's got to be coming
[1:16:26.140 --> 1:16:30.300]  Um, other thing I noticed is that the keyboard
[1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:37.340]  uses the San Francisco as the keycap font instead of VAG rounded which they've been using. Oh, I guess I do that
[1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:40.700]  I'm not I'm not a huge. I'm a semi font nerd, but I don't know a huge one
[1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:46.700]  So I didn't notice that I've never really cared for VAG rounded as the keycap font. So I'm delighted by that change
[1:16:47.980 --> 1:16:50.620]  Now what was it that you didn't like about it out of curiosity?
[1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:52.700]  It looks okay
[1:16:52.700 --> 1:16:58.540]  The capital letters look okay to me, but they don't look great, but the lowercase ones to me are just gross
[1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:03.580]  Like shift, you know, that everything's written in lowercase tab caps. Oh, right
[1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:10.300]  And it's just like a it looks childlike to me. It's of to me. It's a childlike childish font
[1:17:10.940 --> 1:17:12.940]  It doesn't just doesn't look serious enough
[1:17:14.060 --> 1:17:18.620]  So you let you think some people just go a little stronger. Oh, I definitely think so and I think it's I think it's really
[1:17:18.620 --> 1:17:26.060]  To me the whole reason they're using it on a watch is that it looks to me like a hardware font
[1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:30.380]  It looks like the type of typeface you would use to stamp
[1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:36.540]  You know the the stuff on the back of a watch case which is exactly the font they're using to stamp
[1:17:36.940 --> 1:17:40.380]  You know stainless steel 42 millimeters, etc. On the back
[1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:42.460]  It looks like a hardware font
[1:17:42.460 --> 1:17:45.980]  It looks like something that you would stamp in the metal and so it looks good to me
[1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:51.740]  I haven't seen it in person obviously, but it looks to me like a natural fit for a hardware like the keycaps on a keyboard
[1:17:53.580 --> 1:17:57.900]  Interesting just has a certain it has a certain seriousness to it
[1:17:59.820 --> 1:18:01.340]  Yeah
[1:18:01.340 --> 1:18:06.700]  One thing about the the watch stuff a lot of it like the companion app and the the fonts on the watch face
[1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:11.180]  There's like a mixture of stuff they're using and sometimes the mixture is really awkward
[1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:15.900]  Like the companion app has like two or three different fonts on the the pairing screen
[1:18:16.380 --> 1:18:20.460]  It's really weird. I don't know. It's it seems in like an unusual
[1:18:21.260 --> 1:18:29.420]  Mistep or or decision. Anyway, and it may just be a visibility thing or a differentiation thing like this is that this is actionable
[1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:31.020]  This is not actionable
[1:18:31.180 --> 1:18:35.100]  But it seems like an odd choice to use fonts for that rather than stroke thickness or
[1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:38.060]  You know an outline or something like that
[1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:41.340]  But maybe they're just handicapped by their decisions their design decisions
[1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:46.300]  And they have to kind of make compromises in terms of differentiation between buttons and not
[1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:51.820]  Let's take a break you have any more on the MacBook before we take a break
[1:18:52.540 --> 1:18:56.460]  Uh, no, not really. I mean the batteries. I don't think that necessarily is like a
[1:18:57.580 --> 1:19:02.860]  World-shattering invention, but I think it's a methodology that will be copied if it can't be you know
[1:19:03.180 --> 1:19:07.340]  IP-wise I guess I guess because the last the last thing I guess we should talk about and I've been asked this
[1:19:07.340 --> 1:19:11.020]  So I guess I should answer it is why didn't why isn't this called the MacBook Air?
[1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:16.300]  And I think it's simply because it's too expensive that MacBook Air is all once Mac
[1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:20.380]  You know they anything that's called MacBook Air has to be at the price points the MacBook Air is already at
[1:19:21.100 --> 1:19:26.540]  And they're you know, so that's why they've kept it. That's why they've added it to the product lineup instead of replacing anything
[1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:30.620]  But then clearly as you know within a year or two years
[1:19:30.620 --> 1:19:37.660]  It this will replace the MacBook Air's in the lineup as the price comes down once they can make one of these for you know
[1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:41.020]  8.99 or 9.99 the MacBook Airs will just go away
[1:19:41.580 --> 1:19:42.380]  Yep, yep
[1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:44.620]  Absolutely, I think it's just a stake in the ground
[1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:47.500]  reserving that MacBook name for this
[1:19:48.220 --> 1:19:52.220]  design of MacBook. Yeah, and I think the other angle too is in terms of
[1:19:52.220 --> 1:19:59.500]  A statement about the future that when the air debuted being so thin and light was
[1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:05.740]  Remarkable and exceptional and I think Apple is saying now of course it's going to be this crazy thin and light
[1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:10.780]  That's the default this it doesn't it doesn't even need to be called out in the name
[1:20:11.180 --> 1:20:13.820]  This is just what a MacBook is and should be
[1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:17.020]  Right, right
[1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:22.140]  Let me think our next sponsor and it is our good friends at Fracture
[1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:28.460]  You know Fracture they're the company you send them photos and they print them directly on glass
[1:20:29.180 --> 1:20:34.460]  Not a piece of paper that's behind glass mounted in a frame. They take the glass. I don't know how they do it
[1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:39.260]  Nobody else does it. It's crazy. They take the glass. They print your photo right on it
[1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:44.860]  It is crazy. It's exactly like the way that on an LCD like with Apple stuff
[1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:49.020]  Where when it's laminated to the glass it looks like the pixels are right there on the surface
[1:20:49.580 --> 1:20:53.580]  That's exactly what images printed by Fracture looks like
[1:20:54.860 --> 1:21:01.500]  They have all sorts of sizes everything from little small desktop type sizes to really big things that you could hang on a wall
[1:21:03.340 --> 1:21:07.420]  And the quality is just amazing. It is so great and
[1:21:08.540 --> 1:21:09.580]  It looks amazing
[1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:13.500]  You're gonna get question because you can just mount it right on your wall then with no frame around it
[1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:16.780]  Just a piece of glass printed edge to edge with your pictures
[1:21:18.300 --> 1:21:21.100]  Really high quality really great service
[1:21:21.260 --> 1:21:28.300]  It comes in the most clever packaging that you could imagine where it's the actual thing that they ship it to you in
[1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:32.060]  itself is can be used to
[1:21:33.580 --> 1:21:36.060]  Prop it up on your desk. It's a little what would you call that a
[1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:41.180]  Like an easel it comes with the stuff that you need behind it if you want to mount it on a wall
[1:21:41.180 --> 1:21:48.140]  Really, really clever packaging really high quality and every size imaginable
[1:21:49.260 --> 1:21:51.580]  Free shipping on orders over a hundred bucks
[1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:54.940]  And they have a code
[1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:56.940]  Just for listeners of the show
[1:21:58.060 --> 1:22:02.620]  Use this code when you order the code is to secret. So I want to whisper
[1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:06.300]  Daring fireball all one word
[1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:13.340]  And you'll save 15% on anything you order whether it's one picture or a bunch
[1:22:13.740 --> 1:22:17.820]  You'll save 15% which is a great discount by using the code Daring fireball
[1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:21.340]  So where do you go? Where's their website? How do you see this in action? Go to
[1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:24.140]  Fractureme.com
[1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:35.020]  F-R-A-C-T-U-R-E-Me-M-E.com and remember that code Daring fireball and you'll save 15% my thanks to them
[1:22:37.340 --> 1:22:39.820]  So now we finally come to the watch
[1:22:43.100 --> 1:22:45.980]  I mean it's like we've been resisting talking about it, essentially, but
[1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:53.260]  Yeah, it's interesting what they chose to say additionally
[1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:56.700]  That they hadn't said before
[1:22:57.340 --> 1:23:03.500]  I mean the apple pay was obviously a good tie-in. They mentioned apple pay. I mean, let's start at the top of the announcement, right?
[1:23:03.580 --> 1:23:05.580]  So they bring out
[1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:07.820]  You know Tim comes out and introduces
[1:23:08.620 --> 1:23:10.620]  He introduced
[1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:12.620]  Kevin, right?
[1:23:12.620 --> 1:23:17.260]  Christy Turlington talked a bit. Oh, no, that's right. You're right. Christy Turlington was first. Yeah
[1:23:18.140 --> 1:23:20.140]  That's an interesting. What would you think of that?
[1:23:20.460 --> 1:23:24.620]  I thought it was good. I've saw that there was definitely some backlash where people were like
[1:23:25.420 --> 1:23:28.300]  cynically saying you know why go to you know why why
[1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:31.100]  More or less accusing apple of exploiting
[1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:34.060]  You know Africa in the name of selling
[1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:37.100]  $1,000 watches. I
[1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:40.300]  Completely disagree. I think that there was no
[1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:43.980]  I think it was a total natural that they were going to bring out somebody famous
[1:23:44.540 --> 1:23:47.260]  I mean not that they had to but it sounds you know, I'm sure
[1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:51.020]  If they wasn't her in Africa, it would have been somebody else
[1:23:51.580 --> 1:23:58.460]  Here like in some alternate universe. There's some other celebrity or athlete. Let's say who they brought out here and
[1:23:59.340 --> 1:24:03.340]  Show them training and exercising here in the United States
[1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:07.020]  and it's every bit as much about selling watches
[1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:10.060]  as it would as what they did
[1:24:10.060 --> 1:24:15.820]  Except that in this world where they brought her out and raised attention to her charity
[1:24:16.460 --> 1:24:20.780]  I can't help but think that her that charity has made more money this week
[1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:24.220]  Then they would have made if apple didn't feature them, right?
[1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:30.060]  So in this world where apple did this and shared some of their attention with this charity
[1:24:30.620 --> 1:24:33.580]  that charity has raised more money and the
[1:24:34.220 --> 1:24:36.220]  health and well-being of
[1:24:36.220 --> 1:24:43.100]  Women in Africa is better than it would have been otherwise. So I don't see I don't see how you can be how you can complain about that
[1:24:44.540 --> 1:24:48.700]  Right, I mean, I think that there's an instance. There is a definite
[1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:56.300]  Contrast sharp contrast between wearing say a thousand dollar watch because I think she was using like this deal. Yeah, it was not gold
[1:24:56.780 --> 1:25:04.300]  And right it wasn't date wasn't that would have been the worst wouldn't it? Yeah, she's running through Africa with a 70 thousand dollar watch
[1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:12.620]  So I mean if there was definite contrast, right, but honestly her running shoes were probably several hundred dollars, right?
[1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:15.900]  And anybody that goes to Africa on vacation
[1:25:16.540 --> 1:25:23.820]  To a wildlife preserve which whose their money when they pay that money part of it goes to funding that wildlife preserve
[1:25:23.820 --> 1:25:27.420]  You know when they go visit those things like anybody that goes there and is doing that thing
[1:25:27.420 --> 1:25:34.140]  There's always going to be a sharp contrast between say the watch or sunglasses or expensive clothing that they're wearing and
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:44.300]  The the natural state of the unfortunate natural state of many of the people, you know living in Africa who need assistance or aid or whatever
[1:25:45.180 --> 1:25:48.700]  So there's always going to be a contrast that's always going to be a minefield, right?
[1:25:49.020 --> 1:25:51.420]  So I get it that people
[1:25:51.420 --> 1:25:57.820]  Drew them. They were drawn to that dichotomy and I had a percent think that it's a valid point
[1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:04.700]  But I think that your point in terms of they brought our person on stage. You wasn't just a face who literally
[1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:08.540]  was a mom who started a foundation based on you know
[1:26:09.020 --> 1:26:11.580]  maternal wellness and did all that stuff
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:17.660]  I mean that's that's fantastic like why not you know they could have had an athlete
[1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:21.580]  They could have had just somebody who makes millions of dollars and does nothing, right?
[1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:26.140]  And I think that there was a good choice for them regardless of whatever blowback they may take
[1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:32.540]  You know because of the visual. I think that it was good. I think it's almost and it's almost like a tacit acknowledgement
[1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:34.540]  Yes, there is you know
[1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:35.740]  the
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:40.940]  The income levels around the world are wildly disparate, you know, it's
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:45.100]  They're not hiding behind it. I mean, it's it's a tacit acknowledgement
[1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:49.180]  So I have to say I disagree with anybody who criticized them for that. I think it's
[1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:53.260]  It was only a good thing for the charity, and I think it's a great cause
[1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:58.940]  Yeah, and I saw somebody tweeting because there were plenty people while you why Chris Lee turning to him who cares
[1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:05.260]  Vaudable, you know, et cetera, et cetera, and I hit saw somebody tweet on Twitter and I can't remember who it is
[1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:10.140]  So forgive me, but they were like, you know, you can complain about Chris Lee turning to him when you have started a foundation
[1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:14.060]  Which is raised, you know x amount of dollars for for these things like seriously
[1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:21.020]  You know, they could have had anybody on there any any loser who wanted to wear an Apple watch and come on stage or or film a promo
[1:27:21.420 --> 1:27:26.540]  And instead they had somebody who'd really done real good right, and I think that you got to acknowledge that
[1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:30.860]  Yeah, you know could have been you know, Peyton Manning or something not, you know, not even though, you know
[1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:37.100]  No, no, I should say loser and flick it flip it turns, but yeah, they could have had somebody who was just
[1:27:37.660 --> 1:27:40.620]  Just realizing it. I really didn't mean to say I like Peyton
[1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:45.420]  Manning, I didn't mean it, but you know like that was brutal, but I don't know or you know
[1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:49.900]  Like it's some athlete who was injured last year and you know used Apple watch to you know
[1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:56.860]  Conditioning to come back from a knee injury or something. I don't could have been anything that they could have had bubbles in of all out there
[1:27:57.580 --> 1:27:59.580]  Oh, this is how I lost my weight again
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:02.860]  I'm sorry Pablo. I apologize
[1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:06.940]  But yeah, I think that it's it's an interesting
[1:28:06.940 --> 1:28:11.500]  It was an interesting choice and in the end, I think it was a
[1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:19.180]  Better choice than it could have been in a lot of ways. I thought there was an interesting moment up front where when Tim was talking about
[1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:29.500]  Digital touch and the as a communication feature with the doodles and the taps and the heartbeat and he said I hope somebody send me one of those
[1:28:30.780 --> 1:28:33.900]  Which was I thought oddly personal, you know like
[1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:39.900]  You know, it seemed as though he was you know, like saying
[1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:43.420]  I'm not quite sure how to
[1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:45.420]  Tim Cook looking for love
[1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:53.180]  Right yeah, I think it was I mean, I think it was a joke and it fell firmly in the dad joke range, right?
[1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:57.740]  Which is what you usually get on Apple stage and I thought that was you know a good nod to that
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:04.540]  Um, yeah, it wasn't an interesting one. I remember I remember that. I don't know. I don't want to read too much
[1:29:04.540 --> 1:29:11.580]  It was just it was a good job. Yeah, I don't think you know too much to it, but I do but I think that I do think that's an important part of the watch though
[1:29:12.300 --> 1:29:14.860]  I think it's a very very
[1:29:16.620 --> 1:29:20.620]  I'm gonna say downright essential to its success. I really do think so
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:25.500]  I think if those things don't take off and people don't use them there might be in trouble
[1:29:25.500 --> 1:29:27.500]  Yeah, I think that
[1:29:29.420 --> 1:29:34.540]  You know, I wrote I wrote the thing about the Apple Watch saving time which I genuinely believe it's gonna save a lot of time
[1:29:36.300 --> 1:29:41.580]  But I acknowledge that spending $300 or $500 or whatever to save
[1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:45.740]  Time seems silly, but I think it may actually translate to
[1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:49.340]  improved human relationships, right?
[1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:52.700]  So if I spend less time looking at my phone it's been more time looking at my wife and kid
[1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:57.980]  I'm gonna feel good about that and I'm gonna feel happy because you you can't
[1:29:58.940 --> 1:30:00.940]  You can't know
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:07.260]  Until you get I think it's may come with age or may come with if you get really busy at work
[1:30:07.580 --> 1:30:13.100]  Or you get really busy in in your career or anything like that you you don't know the impact that
[1:30:13.580 --> 1:30:20.540]  Extra time has you know time with your family time away from that has until you lose it or don't have it and then when you
[1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:26.220]  Don't have it you would do anything to get it back and I think that that is going to be a very powerful thing
[1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:29.660]  But I think along with that that interpersonal relationship
[1:30:30.060 --> 1:30:35.260]  You know with the taps and the constant communication the ability to literally reach out and and
[1:30:36.060 --> 1:30:42.620]  Touch your watch which then figuratively touches the other person which then literally touches the other person, right?
[1:30:42.940 --> 1:30:47.660]  I think that that's an interesting translation and it'll be it'll be neat to see how that develops over time
[1:30:47.660 --> 1:30:51.820]  But it's we're not gonna be able to tell until it people that people actually do it
[1:30:51.820 --> 1:30:57.900]  So they could say it all they want what we have to see whether or not that actually takes off. Yeah, I talked about it on
[1:30:58.700 --> 1:31:00.540]  the debug
[1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:04.220]  podcast with Guy English and Renee Ritchie and
[1:31:04.780 --> 1:31:07.020]  the other special guest with John Edwards who's a
[1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:09.580]  watchmaker and
[1:31:09.580 --> 1:31:15.660]  App developer. He's got apps that are like meant for people who are in the watches like you can you know measure the
[1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:22.300]  The accuracy of your mechanical watch with his apps and it really really smart guy knows a lot about the the traditional watch world
[1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:24.380]  But on that show I was talking about a thing
[1:31:25.900 --> 1:31:29.820]  It was actually my friend Adam Leesegor, you know lonely sandwich on Twitter
[1:31:30.700 --> 1:31:36.900]  The sandwich video guy, but we talked about this the Singleton conference back in October and he really opened my mind about this
[1:31:36.900 --> 1:31:43.660]  He was you know his thing was that he thinks everybody is just overlooking that Apple has invented the first ever
[1:31:43.660 --> 1:31:49.980]  Way to touch someone you're intimate with without being within arms distance of them
[1:31:50.700 --> 1:31:53.580]  and in fact you can be you know around the world and
[1:31:55.420 --> 1:31:58.700]  That's really interesting maybe it'll turn out to be nothing
[1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:03.100]  I don't know but I think that there's an enormous amount of potential there, you know
[1:32:03.100 --> 1:32:06.380]  And I know that Apple keeps using the words intimate and
[1:32:06.380 --> 1:32:13.420]  Personal or most personal device ever and you know it could just be marketing spin, but I I
[1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:18.060]  Don't know I honestly think you know in like I said earlier
[1:32:18.060 --> 1:32:20.620]  I think Apple's product marketing usually is
[1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:28.220]  Really about the development of the product and then the advertising is just telling you what they honestly think about it
[1:32:28.860 --> 1:32:34.700]  And so you know, I think there's a scenario where that's truly what they believe that this is intimate and
[1:32:34.700 --> 1:32:41.020]  And that you know being able to send your heartbeat to someone you have a crush on
[1:32:41.900 --> 1:32:47.580]  You know or you know someone you've been married to for 10 15 years or whatever or your kid
[1:32:48.300 --> 1:32:50.300]  is
[1:32:51.340 --> 1:32:55.420]  Profound, you know, I'm I'm hesitant to to
[1:32:56.700 --> 1:33:02.460]  To brush this aside as a gimmick the most intimate thing that I have
[1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:06.860]  Promotely with like my wife for instance is our I message
[1:33:07.580 --> 1:33:11.660]  Stream, right? Like that is our that's our communication method
[1:33:11.980 --> 1:33:16.300]  We don't talk on the phone a whole lot unless they we have something explicit to say or we're driving
[1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:22.060]  You know in our day-to-day like a picture of my daughter or a picture of where I am
[1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:25.740]  So she just knows I'm safe and where I am because I travel a lot for work
[1:33:26.460 --> 1:33:29.740]  That our I message stream is our intimate communication
[1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:33.500]  Window and yeah, I have an Android phone and I use that too
[1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:36.140]  But she doesn't so that doesn't become a conduit for us
[1:33:36.140 --> 1:33:42.140]  Although I assume it's very similar for an Android user, you know, they're text message inbox with their significant other
[1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:47.180]  Would be one of their most intimate streams of communication back and forth
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:51.500]  But text messaging has this problem with emotional context
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:57.420]  It's very difficult to to exhibit or transmit emotional context and text messaging
[1:33:57.420 --> 1:34:06.460]  It's a constant problem, right? And you that's why kind of emoji was kind of took off and still obviously still on the rise
[1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:08.220]  I think people are very very fond of it
[1:34:08.460 --> 1:34:09.980]  But I think that that
[1:34:09.980 --> 1:34:14.540]  Translating that into something that's tactile and visual
[1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:21.580]  On your wrist is a would be a very very powerful thing and I'm anxious to see how that developed. Yeah, so here's like a scenario
[1:34:21.580 --> 1:34:23.580]  I was thinking of so um
[1:34:23.740 --> 1:34:24.700]  like
[1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:31.180]  My son desperately wants an Apple watch very very much so it's a you know high expectation that he's gonna get one for Christmas
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.220]  Like imagine me picking up from school. It's three o'clock and you know
[1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:43.580]  I just want to let him know hey, I'm here, you know
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:50.620]  so one tap to communication one tap to pick his thing and then I give the phone a force tap so
[1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:55.500]  Click the button one tap on this green one force touch and then all of a sudden
[1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:59.820]  He gets a tap on his wrist and looks down and it just shows that I sent it, you know
[1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:04.300]  My name is there and it just shows that I sent him a tap and then he'll just know that it's like me saying hey
[1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:07.980]  I'm here like I don't have to say I'm here. I don't have to send him any words
[1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:11.900]  Just tap here. I am I'm out back, right?
[1:35:12.380 --> 1:35:17.020]  Like in the context is the rest. Yeah, the context is the rest because he's on his way out the door
[1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:21.820]  You know at three three o'one after schools over like he'll get it. You know
[1:35:22.860 --> 1:35:26.380]  That's pretty interesting to me. Yeah, and I
[1:35:28.860 --> 1:35:34.220]  This is essentially what the guys at yo were trying to sell I said that right with the context of the yo
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:39.980]  Yeah, oh, oh you did okay, maybe that's what I read, but yeah, they it is right. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing
[1:35:40.540 --> 1:35:44.380]  Yeah, and so everybody made fun of yo, you know that right like it became a big
[1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.940]  I don't think it's like what is it but
[1:35:48.940 --> 1:35:55.900]  But I totally see it that way, you know, and I feel like by being physical instead of verbal instead of
[1:35:56.540 --> 1:36:01.660]  a stream of ASCII characters that display on a screen that you read by being
[1:36:02.140 --> 1:36:10.220]  Physical it could be that could be super important. I try not to just dismiss stuff like that like yo and like this
[1:36:10.220 --> 1:36:15.580]  Step thing out of hand like I'll make jokes about yo just like anybody else or whatever because I think it's it's funny
[1:36:15.740 --> 1:36:17.740]  Especially when they're giving millions of dollars before
[1:36:18.300 --> 1:36:20.860]  Having proven that it actually has traction or anything
[1:36:21.100 --> 1:36:21.900]  um
[1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:27.740]  But I think that it's there's the simpler something is the easier it is to make jokes and fun about it
[1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:35.100]  You know and yet those are usually the things that have the potential to be the most powerful because of their simplicity
[1:36:35.100 --> 1:36:43.420]  All right, so yeah, you know yo, it's non-verbal communication can be so important, but it's always been about
[1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:50.380]  Being in proximity to each other right like so like just another stupid example now
[1:36:50.380 --> 1:36:53.980]  This one I don't know is replaceable by the watch, but it's like imagine you're at a
[1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:57.180]  Family dinner. It's Thanksgiving or something like that
[1:36:57.180 --> 1:37:00.860]  You're at the grandparents house and it's long and it's boring and people are talking about boring stuff
[1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:03.660]  And if you're sitting next to your kid
[1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:08.460]  You can just and you know that they're bored just give their leg a little squeeze and then they look at you
[1:37:08.460 --> 1:37:13.820]  And you just give them a look like I know. Hey, thanks for putting up. You know, you can just shoot a look like
[1:37:13.820 --> 1:37:16.060]  Hey, thanks for putting up with this. I know this is boring
[1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:21.820]  Uh, you know, I'm just saying anything right and it's like non-verbal communication you can do things so
[1:37:22.300 --> 1:37:26.220]  That are so interesting and truth be told that the word applies. It's intimate
[1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:29.980]  So I'm curious how to play out. I
[1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:34.140]  Do think I think people did associate the oh, yeah, go ahead
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:39.020]  Well, I just think the other angle that's important is that it only works if everybody involved has an Apple watch
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:44.300]  Check yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean, obviously that's important for Apple
[1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:48.380]  It's important for them to
[1:37:49.020 --> 1:37:53.580]  Convince you that the two-way aspect of it is important because that means that
[1:37:54.220 --> 1:37:56.540]  You know, you're you're gonna get it's not just the most
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:02.060]  Techie person in the family will own one because then half the stuff that they that is available to them won't work
[1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:07.260]  Right, you have to have it's sort of a family device that everybody has one
[1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:12.860]  Um, so they have a potential assault a lot of these things. I think yeah, totally
[1:38:13.420 --> 1:38:14.940]  um
[1:38:15.100 --> 1:38:17.660]  What did you think of Kevin Lynch?
[1:38:19.980 --> 1:38:24.140]  So I thought he did pretty well. I thought he was pretty good up there
[1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:28.300]  He seemed much more comfortable than he was last time
[1:38:29.020 --> 1:38:36.380]  Sort of owning his position now and and saying, you know, I'm okay being here. I have things to say and
[1:38:37.500 --> 1:38:41.180]  You know, I'm comfortable in in my knowledge of them
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:43.580]  That's the way it seemed to come across
[1:38:43.580 --> 1:38:46.620]  But I liked it. I thought he did a good job. I thought he was personable. He was comfortable
[1:38:47.260 --> 1:38:49.260]  He demonstrated stuff fairly well
[1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:55.260]  Um, yeah, I think you know, we're all it you know, we're just being honest
[1:38:55.260 --> 1:38:57.260]  you know we're harsh critics of
[1:38:57.740 --> 1:39:02.140]  The presenters at Apple events because the bar is so high and
[1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:07.660]  I think it was remarkable how much better he did I don't think he did terribly in September
[1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:14.060]  But it was awkward at times and he seemed a little just a little unpolished and I thought it was remarkable
[1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.780]  How much better he did having only done one of them before?
[1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:25.020]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, he was he was very very nervous last time you could tell and he'd definitely overcame that
[1:39:25.420 --> 1:39:31.660]  This time around. I thought it was he stepped up. Yeah, you know because this is the Apple events the super bowl of tech events
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:37.260]  So I think he really stuff yeah, and Craig Federigi comes in mind Craig Federigi when he rejoined
[1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:39.580]  Apple and his first on stage appearance was
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:44.940]  Forget when it was but I know it was the back to the Mac event where they first announced hey
[1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:49.740]  Here's a whole bunch of things that we've been doing on iOS that we're going to bring to the Mac in the next version and
[1:39:50.700 --> 1:39:57.020]  His hands were literally shaking like he had trouble going through the demo because his hand on the mouse was shaking and he
[1:39:57.340 --> 1:40:01.020]  Wasn't able to click and it was almost like awkward to watch and now
[1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:05.900]  He's one of the best presenters they have in fact on Twitter as much as people
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:07.980]  It's you know, we're argue, you know
[1:40:07.980 --> 1:40:10.380]  We're arguing that he's the best that he's even better than you know
[1:40:10.380 --> 1:40:13.340]  Shiller or Tim Cook that he's the best that they have and it only you know
[1:40:13.340 --> 1:40:15.340]  Was only like two or three events in?
[1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:18.620]  Yeah, I agree that he is one of their best
[1:40:18.940 --> 1:40:22.780]  He has a presence. He comes on stage now and he seems like he's having fun
[1:40:23.740 --> 1:40:29.900]  He really he's he works the room. Yeah, you know, and I think that that is a it's a different
[1:40:29.900 --> 1:40:36.220]  It's actually a different very different than chillers measured take or Tim's like passion
[1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:39.900]  Thing that he's got you know, it's very much like hey
[1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:44.860]  We're all here. We got some really cool stuff. We think you'll love to see it. You know
[1:40:44.860 --> 1:40:49.420]  Let's just have some fun up here. Look at my hair. You know, he's he comes across like
[1:40:50.060 --> 1:40:54.780]  To me like Bob Saggot on the old full-house show like he's just
[1:40:55.260 --> 1:41:01.980]  Just owns the dad Joe nature of it, you know, and which is funny because and Bob and Bob's not like that at all, right?
[1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:05.500]  Like Bob Saggot is actually one of the like dirtiest comics
[1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:09.900]  And like I like anybody knows anything about like stand-up comedy comedians
[1:41:09.900 --> 1:41:12.620]  And like knows that Bob Saggot is like just brutally
[1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:15.580]  Blue in his usual stuff
[1:41:15.580 --> 1:41:22.380]  So like the idea that he was like playing this g rated dad on a hit show was like
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:27.740]  Just icing on the cake, but but that's what right it was almost stunt cast right, you know
[1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:31.340]  It just he wasn't extremely well-known at the time right, but he totally, you know
[1:41:31.420 --> 1:41:32.700]  He he bought into it though
[1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:36.540]  Like you know, he totally sold and like federated. He's like that like his you know
[1:41:36.540 --> 1:41:40.780]  He totally owns the corny jokes that he you know sprinkles throughout this thing. He's
[1:41:41.740 --> 1:41:47.340]  Yeah, and they don't work if you don't right they don't the they come off as forced or awful or grown
[1:41:47.340 --> 1:41:52.300]  Where the and people will grown even now, but they're grown good naturely because they know he's in on the joke
[1:41:52.300 --> 1:41:54.380]  Yeah, there's like I'm that's why he comes off
[1:41:54.380 --> 1:41:57.660]  There's like a meta level to it. It's like two levels deeper on the one level
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:00.140]  He totally tries to sell the joke as hard as he can
[1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:07.500]  But on another level. He's also got like I know this is corny like he's not trying to convince you that this is you know anything
[1:42:07.500 --> 1:42:14.220]  But you know g rated corporate comedy, you know, he owns that's why would people refer to dad jokes
[1:42:14.380 --> 1:42:20.300]  That's what they're saying like your dad knows what he's saying is corny, but he's just like he just wants to talk to you
[1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:26.220]  Right that's all he's doing. He's like trying to initiate a conversation and be like and he knows that you're gonna
[1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:31.500]  Think it's corny and he's doing it big almost because of that right so that you guys are both in on the joke
[1:42:32.060 --> 1:42:34.220]  And I think that's that that's what comes across there
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:35.900]  Let me take one last break here
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:37.740]  And then we'll we'll keep going on Apple watch
[1:42:37.740 --> 1:42:42.860]  But I want to say I have one more that sponsor to thank and it's our good friends at square space
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:46.220]  Now square space is you're all in one
[1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:52.460]  website building designing hosting product you go to square space and
[1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:56.140]  Sign up and boom you have a website
[1:42:57.180 --> 1:43:03.420]  The old days you said you know to to get a website started g's what do we do you just go to a hosting service and what do you have?
[1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:07.660]  You've like a HTML file like index dot HTML that says like
[1:43:08.140 --> 1:43:13.500]  Welcome to my website and then you have to start from there and you have to design your website figure out what it looks like
[1:43:13.900 --> 1:43:21.660]  Then figure out the HTML and CSS that would actually make it look like what you want it to look like and then you have to upload it all
[1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:23.740]  And then you have to figure out some kind of
[1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:30.220]  Content management system if it's something that you want to update regularly like a blog or something like that
[1:43:31.180 --> 1:43:35.100]  And you had to do it all by hand square space is totally different
[1:43:35.100 --> 1:43:39.740]  It's just a whole level up from that you go to square space and sign up
[1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:47.420]  And you start just by picking templates to choose from and they have a whole bunch of them all professionally designed all of them
[1:43:47.420 --> 1:43:55.020]  Responsive so they scale up from everything from a phone to a tablet to a big 30 inch display
[1:43:55.820 --> 1:44:03.660]  And they're configurable not by using code, but just drag and drop if you want this thing on the right instead of on the left
[1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:06.380]  You just drag it from the left to the right and boom there it is
[1:44:07.020 --> 1:44:09.500]  And they've it's always been like that
[1:44:09.500 --> 1:44:13.020]  That's but square space is done right from the beginning but with the newest version
[1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:18.380]  They call it square space seven and you can go to squarespace.com slash seven spell it out
[1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:22.540]  SEV and like like the movie and see all the new stuff
[1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:29.020]  But they've really really taken it to a new level in terms of just how much it's visual and
[1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:33.820]  Dragon Drop and what you see is what you get for web design
[1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:39.020]  And they handle everything all the hosting and everything too everything is all it's not separate
[1:44:39.020 --> 1:44:44.060]  It's all just one thing you go there you build your website and you have a website. It's that easy
[1:44:44.700 --> 1:44:50.220]  Um, they have a partnership now one of the squarespace seven features is a partnership with
[1:44:50.780 --> 1:44:51.740]  Getty images
[1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:56.140]  So if you have something where you need to pull in stock photography
[1:44:56.700 --> 1:45:00.620]  Or illustrations or something like that that's built into the product now to

[1:45:10.060 --> 1:45:15.580]  Which is really really profound for people who use Google apps for work and stuff like that
[1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:21.660]  And everything is just beautiful. They have 24 seven support via live chat and email
[1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:28.380]  And the whole thing it starts at just eight bucks a month, which is unbelievably great deal

[1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:36.140]  Uh
[1:45:36.140 --> 1:45:41.260]  Commerce every website comes with free online store. So if you have something you want to sell if the website your building is
[1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:42.220]  You know
[1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:44.220]  Something about some kind of product. You're going to sell
[1:45:44.620 --> 1:45:47.180]  That's just a built-in feature. You don't even have to pay extra for it
[1:45:47.260 --> 1:45:51.100]  It's just something you can turn on and use if that's what you're building a website for
[1:45:51.980 --> 1:45:57.580]  Just can't emphasize enough how just about any kind of website you want to build you can build with squarespace
[1:45:57.660 --> 1:46:00.780]  blog if you have a podcast you want to host you can host a podcast

[1:46:11.340 --> 1:46:15.820]  If you create things and make things you have something to sell you can use it to build a store

[1:47:00.300 --> 1:47:04.060]  So if there's anything that I was disappointed by in the event
[1:47:04.140 --> 1:47:06.140]  It was that they didn't really show
[1:47:06.700 --> 1:47:12.620]  Anything new that they hadn't shown before and I kind of expected that they would accept for third-party stuff
[1:47:13.260 --> 1:47:15.260]  Which they obviously couldn't show with the original
[1:47:15.660 --> 1:47:18.860]  Yeah, I did I wanted them to to
[1:47:19.740 --> 1:47:21.740]  expose
[1:47:21.740 --> 1:47:25.580]  They're reasoning a little bit which they have done in the past, right?
[1:47:26.140 --> 1:47:29.980]  And I think that a lot of this comes in the form of on stage it comes in the form of
[1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:33.900]  We think this is going to be great for x and y, right?
[1:47:34.380 --> 1:47:39.100]  And that is their way of saying these are the things that we were thinking about when we made it
[1:47:39.420 --> 1:47:41.420]  Right and they don't do it always super explicitly
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:44.780]  But it seems like you generally get kind of those knots, right?
[1:47:45.180 --> 1:47:49.020]  And it didn't seem like they did a whole lot of that for the watch. Yeah, definitely not
[1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:51.020]  I
[1:47:51.020 --> 1:47:54.780]  And I think I I think it shows. I think it it
[1:47:56.700 --> 1:47:57.740]  For better for worse
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:48:04.140]  I'm not willing to say that they're wrong. I'm not passing judgment yet, but it seems to me like their message is
[1:48:04.860 --> 1:48:11.980]  Starts with the idea that people want the Apple watch and that it's largely about which one do you want?
[1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:17.820]  And that they've they don't see the need to explain why you want it
[1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:19.820]  Do you agree?
[1:48:21.180 --> 1:48:25.500]  I think that's true. I think they don't see the need, but I also think they're wrong
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:34.380]  Right, so I think they they they feel that if you have an iPhone this first batch of of watch users
[1:48:34.940 --> 1:48:39.100]  Will be people that have an iPhone that want more iPhone-y stuff, right?
[1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:46.060]  That want more of that experience or want to have you know access to those things and here's some cool other things you can do with it
[1:48:46.060 --> 1:48:49.100]  And that's enough and and that is okay
[1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:50.540]  And it may work just fine
[1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:54.780]  But I think that they're wrong if they think and I'm also
[1:48:55.180 --> 1:48:59.340]  Remember I'm projecting motivations on them at this point, but if they think that that's enough
[1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:05.980]  I think they're wrong. I think they actually do need to or needed to focus a little bit more on
[1:49:06.380 --> 1:49:08.380]  use case scenarios
[1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:11.740]  because they're going up hill
[1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:14.620]  against this
[1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:16.620]  this sort of
[1:49:17.660 --> 1:49:19.660]  downward pressure
[1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:21.660]  of
[1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:24.700]  It's more money and it's another thing
[1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:28.060]  I've got in my life that may take attention from me and I
[1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:32.460]  Obviously because I wrote that I feel that it may actually give you back time
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:35.420]  But I think there was none of that explicitly said
[1:49:36.140 --> 1:49:39.260]  Yeah, or very little. I didn't mind the
[1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:41.260]  the
[1:49:41.260 --> 1:49:46.060]  What was the what's the word the the conceit of Kevin Lynch's
[1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:51.340]  demo of let's just run through a typical day in the life of an apple watch
[1:49:51.820 --> 1:49:53.820]  I think that was good
[1:49:53.820 --> 1:50:00.460]  You know and a lot of it was third party, but what was missing and they've never done is like with the original iPhone
[1:50:01.180 --> 1:50:04.860]  Steve Jobs was like here it is and then he showed it and here's the home screen
[1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:09.180]  And it was here's what all the apps do
[1:50:09.180 --> 1:50:15.580]  I'm not quite sure that he opened every app, but he certainly opened all the main ones, right? He opened you know
[1:50:15.580 --> 1:50:17.580]  He went through Safari
[1:50:17.580 --> 1:50:19.580]  he went through mail
[1:50:21.420 --> 1:50:25.020]  He went through the phone app and said, you know, we you know
[1:50:25.020 --> 1:50:29.580]  We've reinvented the phone and you know, here's you know voice mail sucks here now
[1:50:29.580 --> 1:50:33.660]  We've done it the right way. It's visual you get them in a list like just like your email and
[1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:38.300]  You can see who they're from and play them and delete them in a list like this
[1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:42.540]  You know, so you're not like an animal anymore sitting there stabbing buttons, right?
[1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:46.780]  Like you forget I mean I'm voice sucks anyway and everybody nobody really likes getting false
[1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:51.820]  But god voice mail sucked before the iPhone. It was ridiculous. Oh my god. It was yeah
[1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:55.100]  It was so bad and and once you got a few messages deep
[1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:58.060]  It was just horrific and so yeah that on stage it was such a
[1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:03.020]  Cool trick a lot. Yeah, so like maybe like you know your dad and your mom called you know
[1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:06.060]  You know two or three times a week a lot. You have a bunch of voicemails there
[1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:08.060]  But you've got a voicemail from
[1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:11.420]  You know like a doctor appointment or something like that
[1:51:11.420 --> 1:51:12.860]  That's four five deep now
[1:51:12.860 --> 1:51:17.980]  But you still need it because the doctors that that message is the only thing you have that has the phone number of the office
[1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:20.300]  And you need to call them back because you have to move your appointment
[1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:22.540]  So I get sucked before finding that message
[1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:25.500]  And it's you know
[1:51:26.460 --> 1:51:27.900]  He showed it though, right?
[1:51:27.900 --> 1:51:28.460]  I don't know
[1:51:28.460 --> 1:51:29.660]  I think he went through like calendar
[1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:30.700]  I maybe he didn't go through them all
[1:51:30.700 --> 1:51:33.980]  But it just seemed to me like and and at least you could see what they all are
[1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.220]  And if he didn't show you the calculator app
[1:51:36.220 --> 1:51:39.340]  You saw the icon on the home screen and you knew well done. It's calculator
[1:51:39.980 --> 1:51:46.300]  I still think like to me it's crazy that like there's all these apps on the home screen of the watch that they still haven't
[1:51:47.020 --> 1:51:48.780]  Told us what they do
[1:51:48.780 --> 1:51:52.700]  Like right out of the box. Yeah, there's a bunch of them like get the app store
[1:51:52.700 --> 1:51:56.060]  Forget you know for you know, which I do think is important and it's you know
[1:51:56.780 --> 1:51:59.500]  Sent key to the success of the thing long-term as a platform
[1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:04.380]  But I'm just saying as an Apple watch user you buy it you bring it home you put it on your wrist
[1:52:04.380 --> 1:52:07.580]  And there's a bunch of apps on the home screen and they still haven't explained them
[1:52:08.380 --> 1:52:10.380]  I'm really surprised by that
[1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:14.060]  And disappointed honestly Tim Cook did mention it
[1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:20.060]  He said you know like one of our team members who's wearing it loves using his watch to take pictures remotely
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:23.740]  But they didn't show it. I can't believe they didn't show it such a visual thing too
[1:52:24.540 --> 1:52:28.540]  Like I just I just kind of feel like however many icons
[1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:35.180]  There are on the home screen out of the box. They need to be justified explained to us. Why why they're there
[1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:41.820]  You know, and I guess you know, I don't know to me there's a and maybe it's justified maybe they're
[1:52:42.780 --> 1:52:49.500]  It's gonna say arrogance. You know is justified that they're they know that it people will buy it and people will figure it out on their own
[1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:56.940]  But I'm surprised because to me that's what that to me is how they that that's why I say that it felt like two different events
[1:52:56.940 --> 1:53:00.540]  It like the first half focused on the MacBook
[1:53:01.100 --> 1:53:10.300]  Did exactly what Apple to me always does the hallmark of it is that they here's here's everything that's different and knew about this here's why and?
[1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:13.980]  You know the trackpad the keys the
[1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:18.460]  You know the new screen technology the lack of ports, you know
[1:53:19.020 --> 1:53:21.340]  They're going away, you know, we do everything wirelessly now
[1:53:21.340 --> 1:53:27.740]  And we've you know done this amazing battery stuff to make it all work and shrunk them other board and got rid of the fans
[1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:29.100]  So that we had room for batteries boom
[1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:34.780]  They explained it all whereas the watch they're not doing that at all and I don't want to read too much into it because I really have no idea
[1:53:34.780 --> 1:53:37.900]  Behind the scenes who does what but it
[1:53:38.700 --> 1:53:45.260]  From the outside externally. It's interesting to me that Shiller has had nothing to do with the watch on stage
[1:53:46.940 --> 1:53:48.940]  And I don't know that is interesting
[1:53:48.940 --> 1:53:58.940]  You know, I just I just couldn't I can't see him doing a presentation like this where it's not explained and I again
[1:53:59.100 --> 1:54:01.340]  I'm not trying to say that there's any kind of
[1:54:02.620 --> 1:54:06.380]  Controversy inside Apple about it. Maybe he helped you know for all I know
[1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:11.180]  He was right there and stage directed everything about the watch thing even though he wasn't doing it
[1:54:11.180 --> 1:54:13.580]  I don't know, but it just is interesting to me
[1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:18.060]  No, I note to me it felt like a different tone and a different style of presentation
[1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:21.580]  And it's interesting that Shiller had nothing to do with it at either event
[1:54:22.620 --> 1:54:26.780]  It is interesting and it does it is against his sort of presentation style
[1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:32.540]  Not to say this is what it is and explain it in in sort of enough detail
[1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:38.620]  But not too much to kind of get the point across why a it's special and b you'd want to use it
[1:54:39.180 --> 1:54:43.340]  Right, yeah, and that that I think was missing from the watch. I have you know
[1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:44.860]  I had this theory and I'll float it here
[1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:50.380]  I was gonna write about it, but I'll float it here for the first time you can tell me what you think so I have this theory about the whole use case scenario
[1:54:50.860 --> 1:54:55.500]  Obviously, I think time saved is an initial metric to look at you know when you get a watch
[1:54:56.300 --> 1:55:00.620]  Do I'm gonna try to do this myself? I'm gonna try to like gauge how many times I look at my phone during the day
[1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:05.740]  And then I'm gonna get the watch put it on and then measure how many times to look at the phone after that
[1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:10.380]  And then see what the differential is. I think that would be an interesting metric to look at right
[1:55:11.260 --> 1:55:13.260]  But beyond that so that's the initial thing
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:19.900]  My theory is is that they have another strong use case for this, but it depends on
[1:55:21.020 --> 1:55:23.020]  third party
[1:55:23.420 --> 1:55:27.420]  Buy in and time so they can't talk about it yet
[1:55:27.900 --> 1:55:34.380]  And that use case is that the apple watch becomes a a tube of lubricant for your life
[1:55:35.260 --> 1:55:40.620]  So you have the watch on your wrist you walk up to your car and your car unlocks
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:43.980]  With either a confirmation tap or just by proximity
[1:55:44.380 --> 1:55:48.940]  Then you probably a tap I would guess because you want confirmation of a secure thing unlocking
[1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:54.060]  Then you get in your car and your watch tells your your apple your car play
[1:55:54.700 --> 1:55:58.860]  Display that you want to listen to this music and this is you in the car
[1:55:58.860 --> 1:56:02.380]  So you can adjust your seats or whatever the case may be to you
[1:56:03.180 --> 1:56:09.260]  And it loads up your navigation for your morning drive on your apple maps because it knows this is the time
[1:56:09.260 --> 1:56:14.460]  You go to work or you go to school or whatever the case may be you you drive you stop at a gas station
[1:56:14.860 --> 1:56:18.700]  You get out you walk in you pay for coffee with your apple watch
[1:56:19.180 --> 1:56:22.380]  You walk out you get into your car you drive to school
[1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:28.220]  You get out you walk in you hand in your homework by tapping your apple watch a couple times to transmit your
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:32.860]  Your homework to your teacher you sit down you cheat on your test with your apple watch
[1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:38.700]  You know you get the gist right like you right this these these lubricants
[1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:41.420]  We'll add up to once again
[1:56:41.420 --> 1:56:43.100]  It's this a time-saving theme
[1:56:43.260 --> 1:56:49.660]  But they sort of allow you to kind of do this and the model for this is the magic band right at the Disneyland or Disney World
[1:56:50.220 --> 1:56:57.340]  Where they have this band that has NFC and Bluetooth in it and it's your wallet and it's your ticket to the park
[1:56:57.340 --> 1:57:01.100]  And it's your fast pass will still allows you to jump the line and it's your
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:07.820]  Your signal that tells a cast member that you're nearby and they can come up with the personalized offer like oh
[1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:10.620]  Hi Matthew would you like to meet Cinderella? She's right over here
[1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:15.100]  You know all of that stuff and I think that there's a lot of fear involved in that
[1:57:15.180 --> 1:57:19.580]  There's also a lot of possibility and I think that that may be is their long game here
[1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:24.460]  But they can't talk about it yet because they have to have the buy-in from the car manufacturers and from the
[1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:27.180]  POS and from the you know etc etc etc
[1:57:27.580 --> 1:57:32.620]  Yeah, I I I agree with that. I think that calling it
[1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:37.900]  What social lubricant or life lubricant
[1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:43.980]  I gotta refine that because yeah, but yeah, it is. I think that that's the scenario
[1:57:45.180 --> 1:57:51.740]  I also think that maybe more than time-saved what they're trying to pitch it at and this to me
[1:57:51.820 --> 1:57:57.500]  It's you know, it's very it's not any different than any other smartwatch in terms of the mission statement
[1:57:57.500 --> 1:58:04.700]  Which is to me attention-saved that it takes less of your attention to glance at your watch than it does to glance at your phone
[1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:09.020]  Johnny I've had an interesting quote in the
[1:58:09.500 --> 1:58:14.140]  Financial Times interview or feature that he that came out a week ago
[1:58:14.620 --> 1:58:22.300]  Where he said something about with a traditional watch that he noticed that many times he'd glance at his wrist to check the time
[1:58:23.020 --> 1:58:25.820]  and then realize that he hadn't even really
[1:58:25.820 --> 1:58:32.540]  noticed the time and had you'd have to look twice because like the first time he paid was paying so little attention that it didn't even
[1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:34.860]  register
[1:58:35.180 --> 1:58:39.500]  That that's how lightweight a watch can be that you can almost pay
[1:58:40.300 --> 1:58:42.300]  Not enough attention and have to check twice
[1:58:43.260 --> 1:58:45.260]  And that that's interesting
[1:58:45.260 --> 1:58:47.100]  And I do think that's sort of where they're going
[1:58:47.100 --> 1:58:52.220]  But on the other hand that pitch is no different than the pitch friend right where or for pebble or friend
[1:58:52.220 --> 1:59:00.140]  Yeah, right right and the only difference is is that it's our thing and so we're going to make it easier than their thing
[1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:08.700]  Yeah, you know the communication angle is all Apple the sending a doodle sending a heartbeat sending a tap is that's
[1:59:09.740 --> 1:59:17.980]  You know nobody else has anything like that and it's very intimate and personal the notification thing is like the obvious feature that everybody is thought of
[1:59:17.980 --> 1:59:22.940]  Right right I agree so and I mean the reason
[1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:28.940]  Just the very fact that we're having to dissect this makes me think that maybe they didn't communicate these things as clearly as they could
[1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:34.940]  You know they could I one of the things they showed and I know that they've said this in people to notice that so for example
[1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:40.700]  Somebody sends you a text and it will show up on your watch and you can respond either
[1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:43.500]  Like I think three ways
[1:59:43.500 --> 1:59:50.460]  It's like you hit respond and it'll try to give you a couple of guesses in a button. You know in the example being
[1:59:51.740 --> 1:59:53.740]  You know, I'm at the supermarket and I could
[1:59:55.100 --> 1:59:56.620]  Text my wife
[1:59:56.620 --> 2:00:01.260]  You know the shopping list just says butter and I could say salted or unsalted butter
[2:00:01.260 --> 2:00:07.820]  And then it's the AI is going to parse that and if she enters on her watch she will have buttons that say salted unsalted
[2:00:07.980 --> 2:00:09.980]  Not sure
[2:00:09.980 --> 2:00:14.460]  Which is cool obviously it does not cover every scenario and then you know
[2:00:14.460 --> 2:00:23.420]  You can use the microphone to either send a recording of audio or to have the dictations, you know dictate what you say
[2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:26.380]  I could see that being useful
[2:00:26.380 --> 2:00:32.460]  But to me it's interesting and telling and sort of questionable that you can't do that for email for email
[2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:37.420]  You can only read and if you want to reply it has to be handed off to your phone
[2:00:37.420 --> 2:00:40.060]  and
[2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:45.020]  I can kind of see why because emails are longer and more complex and you know how much dictation
[2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:46.860]  You know like text is the right amount of
[2:00:47.980 --> 2:00:51.340]  Length implicit implicit not necessarily enforced
[2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:53.180]  I
[2:00:53.180 --> 2:00:57.500]  Don't know I'm not even sure what the largest I message your allowed to send is in terms of words
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:01:01.980]  I don't even know if there is a limit, but you know there's an implicit idea that it's a sentence or two
[2:01:01.980 --> 2:01:03.980]  Whereas an email might be longer
[2:01:03.980 --> 2:01:09.420]  But they showed it. They showed on stage like reading an email on Apple Watch and it seems ridiculous
[2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:12.460]  right it's
[2:01:13.260 --> 2:01:15.260]  Yeah, it does
[2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:18.460]  The people that I talked to that I've been using it kind of like on and off
[2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:22.860]  For a while or have had it on the wrist they say that it's actually much more readable
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:29.500]  I guess then it seems and my experience in person was I pulled up some some stuff that I could be then I scrub back and forth
[2:01:29.500 --> 2:01:36.300]  And it's definitely readable, but it could it's tiring right the reason they call them glances and the reason that a lot of their stuff
[2:01:36.300 --> 2:01:38.460]  Is based on you flipping your watch up to look at it
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:41.500]  It's like I was doing a demo recording a demo with
[2:01:41.820 --> 2:01:47.420]  Darryl my coworker and we were he was filming me and I was running through the watches pieces right for our like you know
[2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:51.980]  Apple watch hands-on thing and as I'm holding my wrist up there and I'm dinking around with it
[2:01:51.980 --> 2:01:56.460]  And it took like three four minutes or whatever to record the demo five minutes and by the end of it
[2:01:56.460 --> 2:02:00.860]  I'm an arm kind of hurt not I'm a little out of shape, but I don't think that anything to do with it
[2:02:00.860 --> 2:02:04.380]  It's just it's an uncomfortable position to hold for a long period of time
[2:02:04.620 --> 2:02:09.500]  Like if you hold your arm up and out in front of you and position it so that you're looking at like your watch face
[2:02:09.900 --> 2:02:12.300]  If you hold that for any more than maybe 30 seconds
[2:02:12.300 --> 2:02:13.660]  It starts to get uncomfortable
[2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:18.700]  It's just we're not sort of built to do that and I think that that's an interesting thing
[2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:22.700]  I don't think we're I think we may read something a couple hundred words long
[2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:27.100]  But not much longer than that. I've heard from people who are who've been to the
[2:02:28.060 --> 2:02:33.100]  The third-party lab, you know that they're hosting that they're inviting developers out for that
[2:02:33.980 --> 2:02:40.060]  Maybe I might even be the first thing that they say is that you anything any feature you're thinking about for a watch app
[2:02:40.940 --> 2:02:42.940]  should be
[2:02:42.940 --> 2:02:49.820]  10 to 15 seconds or less of time and if your idea is something that will take more than 15 seconds
[2:02:49.820 --> 2:02:54.460]  It's probably not a good idea for the watch and if your idea
[2:02:55.180 --> 2:02:58.780]  Currently takes more than 15 seconds and you can't you know
[2:02:58.780 --> 2:03:03.420]  You should try to figure out a way to make it 10 seconds and I don't think it's so much about
[2:03:03.980 --> 2:03:09.260]  Partly partly it's about battery life, but I think partly it's even if the battery was a week long
[2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:18.700]  Of serious use. I think that that advice will still stand for exactly the reason you said like it's just the nature of something on your wrist is
[2:03:18.700 --> 2:03:20.700]  ergonomically and
[2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:25.900]  Whatever else psychologically even is you know glances yep
[2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:31.820]  Yep, and then the further away you get from glances the less useful it is and the less people will want to
[2:03:32.300 --> 2:03:37.780]  Utilize whatever app you you've designed and I think there's gonna be a girl a learning curve for that like people are gonna ship stuff
[2:03:37.780 --> 2:03:41.580]  It's obviously not right, you know or or doesn't doesn't work right
[2:03:42.380 --> 2:03:44.380]  Did you um
[2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:49.100]  In their hands-on experience that you had did you get to feel the taps? Oh, yeah
[2:03:49.100 --> 2:03:52.300]  I did and they're really cool. I mean and this is I
[2:03:52.780 --> 2:03:58.540]  Glad you brought that up because this whole tap tick thing is so we're talking about because I think it's a big part of Apple's future
[2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:05.380]  You know on on all their devices. Oh, yeah, we shut the bed by not talking about it. Totally back book. Well, we can do it now
[2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:13.620]  Yeah, did you did you get like I felt taps in September but they were all part of the demo loop and it was really the only taps
[2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:18.220]  I felt we're like when a text message arrived, and I thought man. This is really cool. It's not like a you agree
[2:04:18.220 --> 2:04:21.620]  It's not like a vibration at all. It's it's a new sensation, right?
[2:04:22.100 --> 2:04:28.460]  Yeah, actually it's it's a haptic feedback, but it's done by the use of
[2:04:29.260 --> 2:04:36.260]  What they call lateral force fields which is essentially these forces that are directed sideways at one another and
[2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:42.060]  I believe it's the collision of those forces that they can shape to direct the
[2:04:42.060 --> 2:04:45.260]  The pressure downwards towards your wrist
[2:04:45.860 --> 2:04:52.540]  Did you did you get to demo the whole left right thing because that was something I didn't get to experience in September
[2:04:52.540 --> 2:04:57.820]  Well, I repeated it. I didn't they repeated it again that if you're using it for walking directions
[2:04:57.820 --> 2:05:04.580]  It'll give you a sense of turn right like I still I can't I still can't imagine what that's like it sounds awesome
[2:05:04.860 --> 2:05:10.820]  Yeah, it's like I still haven't gotten it to experience it. No, that's a good question. I didn't I didn't do that
[2:05:10.820 --> 2:05:12.820]  I wish I had now
[2:05:13.820 --> 2:05:20.020]  Yeah, I could see how they could shape it though to go left or I just knowing just a little bit that I know about the technology
[2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:22.020]  there was this
[2:05:22.020 --> 2:05:28.460]  I mean this goes for the the engine because I think that the engine share a lot of similarities between the taptic engine in the in the watch and
[2:05:28.860 --> 2:05:34.140]  the vibration or haptic feedback engine that's underneath the MacBooks touchpad
[2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:39.820]  They share a lot of similarities. Yeah, and that I mean they're essentially based on the
[2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.820]  same
[2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:44.340]  overall
[2:05:45.340 --> 2:05:51.940]  Theory of the way that they shape and move these vibrations so the trackpad and I just published something on this last night
[2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:53.020]  Because I I
[2:05:53.020 --> 2:05:58.780]  asked some coworkers and they didn't know but the trackpad doesn't move on the MacBook at all, right?
[2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:00.780]  Like there's a there's some sort of
[2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:05.580]  Nanometer that they say it's allowed to move, but it doesn't move essentially right because an animators
[2:06:05.580 --> 2:06:12.380]  That's 100,000 that's a sheet of paper or something, right? But it doesn't click it doesn't actually physically move
[2:06:12.380 --> 2:06:18.140]  So when you press it there is a sort of pressure sensitivity threshold that you're allowed to adjust
[2:06:18.220 --> 2:06:23.060]  Which I think is gonna have great implications for accessibility people with you know motor skills issues and things
[2:06:23.300 --> 2:06:27.340]  But there's a certain pressure that you're allowed to push and once you pass that threshold
[2:06:27.420 --> 2:06:33.340]  It sends this signal using this these LFFs these lateral force fields
[2:06:33.340 --> 2:06:35.340]  to
[2:06:36.020 --> 2:06:41.340]  Simulate that the the keypad has clicked and it's the same thing that's using the Taptic engine is using
[2:06:41.340 --> 2:06:49.100]  I believe to direct the force straight down into your wrist and it definitely feels straight down like a finger pushing into your wrist
[2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:55.740]  So hands-on with the MacBook did it feel good like clicking? Oh, it felt it felt so good
[2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:58.260]  That I an Apple person actually had to tell me it didn't move
[2:06:58.260 --> 2:07:02.340]  Really yeah, cuz like I missed that it didn't move or something I would you know
[2:07:02.340 --> 2:07:06.380]  There's a lot going on and I guess I missed it and I was clicking on and there's a cool
[2:07:06.380 --> 2:07:12.060]  Cool later on an Apple person told me. Oh, no, it doesn't move at all because I thought that it had one level of click and then
[2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:18.460]  With the force touch thing you push down further and then it vibrated your finger and you felt like oh, I'm clicking downwards further
[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:24.700]  But he's like no, that says everything know that you didn't even realize that yeah, so in other words
[2:07:24.700 --> 2:07:28.820]  I best way to put it I guess would be if the MacBook is powered off. There's no click at all
[2:07:29.500 --> 2:07:32.420]  You'll just it's a tapping the non trackpad part
[2:07:32.420 --> 2:07:36.740]  Yeah, I had an Apple person tell me that they actually would like set two of them side by side
[2:07:36.740 --> 2:07:40.420]  I guess they're you know testing and playing with them and they could like play piano on them because they're so
[2:07:40.660 --> 2:07:41.860]  They they you know
[2:07:41.860 --> 2:07:46.500]  They basically send all those pulses up and you could like you could like rotate your fingers on them
[2:07:46.500 --> 2:07:51.220]  We get this like sort of piano feel but yeah, if you're it's off that thing is not gonna vibrate
[2:07:51.220 --> 2:07:53.220]  It's not gonna click at all. It's just this basic glass
[2:07:53.220 --> 2:08:00.500]  New stuff tends to ship iOS first. I mean iOS is still the only thing with touch ID
[2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:04.340]  It's just you know, it's the nature of today's Apple
[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:06.340]  I think it's pretty telling that
[2:08:06.340 --> 2:08:13.020]  Force touch and the Taptic engine came to the Mac before iOS and I think the easiest prediction of
[2:08:13.820 --> 2:08:19.620]  2015 is that this year's new iPhones are gonna have force touch and probably I would bet iPads too
[2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:26.540]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, easily and I think there's a Wall Street Journal thing that came out like a report last night or this morning or something
[2:08:26.540 --> 2:08:30.260]  That said, you know iPhones later this year are gonna have force touch and
[2:08:30.980 --> 2:08:32.980]  Yeah, it was like the of obviously right
[2:08:33.900 --> 2:08:37.700]  There is remember two that it's two separate technologies, right?
[2:08:37.700 --> 2:08:44.860]  So you have force touch which is the we know how hard you're pressing so we can do different things depending on how hard you press and
[2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:51.900]  And then there is the the feed Wow force fields. Yeah exactly exactly those haptic that haptic feedback and
[2:08:52.540 --> 2:08:57.980]  It would be interesting to me if one comes to the iPhone without the other because it feels like they're intertwined
[2:08:58.060 --> 2:09:04.260]  Technologies, right because you get the four sensors around the trackpad which which they determine how hard you press and then in the middle
[2:09:04.260 --> 2:09:10.700]  You've got that engine which can give you the vibrations. I think it's I think they're but I think it's both will come because
[2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:17.860]  How cool will it be if I think it'd be so great if your buttons on your phone actually click that's so
[2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:22.980]  Great. Yeah, my god. That's it. You that seems like
[2:09:24.060 --> 2:09:28.940]  Honestly that it seems to me like it. It's it'll be best on IOS
[2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:36.620]  You know even more impressive than it is anywhere else because I think that would be so cool to have touch screen buttons that actually click
[2:09:36.620 --> 2:09:43.540]  Oh, man, that'd be great. I'm waiting just thinking about it. I'm waiting to to email John Chen to ask him for his reactions
[2:09:44.020 --> 2:09:50.700]  The CEO blackberry. I just want to like all these years. You got your wish like click a little keys
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:57.180]  God, I need to think about it for typing. I didn't even think about it, but that would be that'd be great
[2:09:57.180 --> 2:10:06.180]  The other thing they even say they're saying for the Mac is with the trackpad is that it's pressure sensitive drawing
[2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:10.820]  You know that you and that's on a trackpad now take that up
[2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:16.820]  How much better would it be for pressure sensitive drawing on an iPad? It's crazy. It'd be fantastic
[2:10:17.300 --> 2:10:24.420]  Yeah, I think it's really really makes sense to me that the pressure is registered on the device and not through the
[2:10:24.420 --> 2:10:30.260]  Stylus so you have a dumb stylus or your finger and a smart pad
[2:10:30.900 --> 2:10:37.580]  That which is where the pressure is registered. I think any you know all previous efforts that put the pressure sensitivity in a stylus
[2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:43.420]  They had to if they wanted to work on IOS obviously, but I think that's the backwards way of doing it
[2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:51.780]  Yeah, totally 100% and it on it makes an iPad instantly kind of more attractive than say a Cintiq or something like that
[2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:57.660]  Because you're you're drawing you know, you're drawing on this mobile device that has all these capabilities and now it has pressure
[2:10:57.660 --> 2:10:59.660]  pressure sensitivity as well
[2:10:59.900 --> 2:11:06.020]  The one thing that they would be missing at that point which I would really love to see them fix is the latency issue
[2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:10.620]  Right because they're still way they're way above like the 10 millisecond threshold
[2:11:10.620 --> 2:11:14.660]  They're at like 30 or 40 or something or maybe even higher. I can't remember what it is exactly
[2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:18.380]  but below 10 second 10 milliseconds is where
[2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:22.380]  You sort of get this feel where it's one to one like your pen tip
[2:11:22.580 --> 2:11:29.500]  It follows your pen tip exactly because right now if you scrub on an iPad like drawing you're drawing falls way behind
[2:11:29.500 --> 2:11:31.500]  You know the the iPad
[2:11:31.500 --> 2:11:38.660]  or to the stylus tip rather and that's like a screen latency issue and so if they were able to fix that and
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:46.180]  Give this sort of pressure sensitivity to the screen. I mean it would instantly make it the best drawing
[2:11:46.180 --> 2:11:53.420]  Surface out there electronic drawing surface out there and and a lot of artists are already doing amazing work drawing on iPads
[2:11:53.420 --> 2:11:57.580]  But it's you know like you said, it's it could totally take it to another level
[2:11:57.580 --> 2:12:00.180]  And I agree the latency is totally in the show. I'm not an artist
[2:12:00.180 --> 2:12:05.700]  I don't really draw but I notice it whenever I have to sign my name like at an Apple store that you know sign out on a
[2:12:06.260 --> 2:12:07.260]  phone or whatever
[2:12:07.260 --> 2:12:10.580]  Yeah, it lags behind and I it's it's
[2:12:10.580 --> 2:12:16.140]  surmountable like the artists there many artists doing really really cool stuff on iPad. I've seen tons of art like
[2:12:16.140 --> 2:12:21.620]  Apple's last ad thing featured a bunch of art creating an iPad right and so there's obviously people doing neat stuff there
[2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:25.620]  But they're they're bypassing that difficulty by training themselves
[2:12:25.620 --> 2:12:34.180]  And I think that just giving them the the one-to-one the true one-to-one as as we've always had with like taps and scrolling
[2:12:34.780 --> 2:12:40.060]  But doing that with like vigorous drawing or expressive drawing would would help a lot for sure
[2:12:40.060 --> 2:12:42.060]  No
[2:12:42.060 --> 2:12:47.780]  What did you think of the watches themselves like which any of the bands stand out to you?
[2:12:49.300 --> 2:12:51.300]  So I'll make I'll make my
[2:12:51.820 --> 2:12:56.420]  You know purchase prediction now. I think I'm probably gonna end up with the
[2:12:57.740 --> 2:12:59.260]  black
[2:12:59.260 --> 2:13:02.980]  The the space black with the black rubber band
[2:13:02.980 --> 2:13:07.620]  I think that's probably what I'm gonna end up with and not because I don't like the links
[2:13:07.620 --> 2:13:09.900]  But just because I think it's I
[2:13:10.740 --> 2:13:16.260]  Just think I'm gonna get more day-to-day use out of that and then I may end up purchasing like links separately later on
[2:13:16.380 --> 2:13:21.340]  But like the black with black links or the black with the band is kind of what I'm leaning towards right now
[2:13:22.900 --> 2:13:27.260]  The black with the black sports band
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:33.620]  Yeah, but that's the sport sport because I think the black steel one only comes with the links. Oh
[2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:39.300]  Oh, I see what you're saying that you you're talking about black sport or black aluminum
[2:13:40.060 --> 2:13:45.020]  Right with the steel. Yeah. No, probably black aluminum because I think the steel only comes with the steel link
[2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:49.100]  So it would be either one of those two things. Yeah, those are the objectives
[2:13:51.740 --> 2:13:53.740]  Although I want to see
[2:13:53.740 --> 2:13:57.340]  It does seem to me and then a lot of people said it on Twitter
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:05.740]  That it looks like the black steel with the link bracelet is darker than what they showed in September and what they've had on their website
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:12.860]  I can tell yesterday or until Monday, but I don't know though if that's a difference in like the product photography
[2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:19.140]  Or if they actually change the material between them right right. Yeah, I that's what you're saying
[2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:24.100]  I mean, I think they could have they could have definitely enhanced it maybe to make it the bigger differential
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:30.180]  It's possible for sure, but I think that the black the black of the black steel is probably the most instantly attractive to me
[2:14:30.980 --> 2:14:35.900]  But in person the black one looks gorgeous. I mean, it's highly it's like a chrome
[2:14:36.460 --> 2:14:38.340]  But it's very very very pretty
[2:14:38.340 --> 2:14:43.460]  I think that they did a great job with that and the black steel links. It does just it's beastly
[2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:49.060]  It's a very manly design obviously. I don't want to project, you know, and some women may love it
[2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:51.940]  But it seems to me like it's aimed at the mail market
[2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:53.940]  But
[2:14:53.940 --> 2:14:58.900]  Almost all of them had an attractiveness a genuine attractiveness the aluminum ones
[2:14:59.300 --> 2:15:06.140]  The aluminum ones do look very utilitarian next to the other stuff like almost everything else looks very classy
[2:15:06.340 --> 2:15:11.040]  Very polished and refined and the aluminum ones are aluminum, you know
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:16.580]  And it's there's just a difference there and remember to the aluminum ones are the only ones that don't have like a colored crown
[2:15:16.580 --> 2:15:23.980]  Like that the end of the crown is just bullnosed into aluminum. So it there's definitely a feeling of like hey
[2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:30.860]  This is a tool where the other things are maybe a little bit more your personal style, you know
[2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:38.460]  Hey everybody John here
[2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:43.660]  Sorry about this, but the next minute or two of the audio of this episode is a bit garbled
[2:15:43.660 --> 2:15:50.780]  Like some kind of awful sounding digital artifacts something from a low rent horror movie or something
[2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:53.900]  We're not sure what happened nothing we can do about it
[2:15:53.900 --> 2:16:00.100]  Seemed better to keep it for the content then to cut the whole thing and have the show be a bit disjointed
[2:16:00.620 --> 2:16:06.260]  But if we could we do an insert here just to let you know that it's not like you've got a bad copy of the file or something like that
[2:16:06.260 --> 2:16:08.260]  There's a known issue lasts about a minute or two
[2:16:08.260 --> 2:16:14.820]  We'll do our best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Sorry about that. And thanks for listening. Yeah, I
[2:16:16.220 --> 2:16:22.600]  My pricing guesses get pretty good. I certainly got the additional right. I overshot her to steal and I
[2:16:22.780 --> 2:16:28.780]  Hindsight is basically the thing that the mistake I made was overlooking how easy it is physically
[2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:34.940]  Mechanically spots band and there's no reason for that if they weren't willing to try to sell
[2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:40.180]  a multiple band as your purchase which means the price interesting. I
[2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:47.500]  Shouldn't be able to guess exactly the final pricing for stealers because once you assume that the band here be price
[2:16:48.060 --> 2:16:50.060]  to sell
[2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:52.060]  Everything else falls in place. I
[2:16:52.620 --> 2:16:58.540]  Think what's interesting pricing wise though, so let's say you want to get a 42 millimeter
[2:16:59.540 --> 2:17:02.140]  Steel and you want to get really bracelet
[2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:04.140]  It's
[2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:08.060]  $99 right
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:15.100]  Unless you want to get the black right, right? Mm-hmm. And the black's like a hundred bucks more or something like that or 50 bucks more or something
[2:17:15.460 --> 2:17:17.460]  Let me double check
[2:17:17.460 --> 2:17:24.780]  Yeah, $9.99 and it's $50 premium or no $100 premium to get space black. Okay, but let's just say you get the silver one
[2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:28.540]  There's silver colored stainless steel nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
[2:17:28.540 --> 2:17:32.620]  If you buy the sport model
[2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:37.700]  It's six hundred dollars and the link bracelet is only
[2:17:39.100 --> 2:17:40.620]  450
[2:17:40.620 --> 2:17:48.420]  So it would only I guess I guess so I guess you'd pay $50 more than I guess I guess it's it all works out
[2:17:48.420 --> 2:17:51.660]  So if you buy I was thinking that you would save 50 bucks
[2:17:51.660 --> 2:17:55.380]  But no, it's I was getting confused between 38 millimeter and 48 millimeter
[2:17:55.380 --> 2:18:02.940]  Or 42 millimeter prices. So no, it's exactly the same. So you don't pay any penalty if you buy the one that comes with the rubber band and buy a link bracelet
[2:18:02.940 --> 2:18:07.300]  You pay the exact same amount as if you buy the one with the link bracelet and buy a
[2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:09.940]  $50 rubber band
[2:18:10.860 --> 2:18:12.060]  Yeah, that's it
[2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:16.580]  Well, I remember too though that you've got a metal mismatch there Louis Minty
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:22.420]  I made a nice chart of stuff that quote matches end quote and stuff that doesn't in other words
[2:18:22.420 --> 2:18:29.220]  The pin is a different metal than the casing or the buckle is a different metal in the casing or even the links are a different metal than the casing
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:36.380]  So those won't match right because there's only steel and black steel in the link bracelets
[2:18:36.660 --> 2:18:41.520]  So those won't match the casing finish on the aluminum
[2:18:41.620 --> 2:18:47.020]  So if you don't mind a metal mismatch, then you're golden you can do that and it won't cost you any extra
[2:18:47.380 --> 2:18:51.820]  But it will miss it. It won't match. It won't match exactly the metals
[2:18:51.820 --> 2:18:57.060]  Yeah, I don't think that matters as much. I think anybody who does it. It's not going to look bad per se
[2:18:57.580 --> 2:19:06.140]  Because it actually is slightly different than the steel anyway because this steel the case is highly polished and the bracelet is not the bracelet is
[2:19:06.980 --> 2:19:13.900]  Sort of brushed which actually makes sense because it would you know the bracelet is going to take more scratches than it would scarring stuff right
[2:19:14.380 --> 2:19:18.340]  Yeah, you know you see that a lot on on traditional watchbit
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:23.860]  You know bracelet bands that you know some of them are polished, but that's more like when you get like a platinum or gold or something like that
[2:19:23.860 --> 2:19:30.580]  If it's stainless, it's often not polished. Yeah, and on the physical nature of the watch is what we're talking about the bands and the casings
[2:19:31.340 --> 2:19:37.460]  Just for listeners if they haven't you know have the chance to fill these things there are a lot thinner than they look
[2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:44.780]  Both the bands and the casing and this goes for all the bands like all of them are a lot thinner in person
[2:19:44.780 --> 2:19:50.260]  With wise, you know height wise. I should say then it then it looks like in these images
[2:19:50.260 --> 2:19:56.140]  These images make them look like the camera adds 10 pounds the camera is adding 10 pounds to all of these casings and bands
[2:19:56.140 --> 2:20:02.620]  Because I'm looking right now at an image of the 42 millimeter stainless steel with the link bracelet and that link brace
[2:20:02.620 --> 2:20:06.540]  It looks bad, and it's not it's actually surprisingly thin
[2:20:07.180 --> 2:20:09.980]  And and the same goes for the casings too. Yeah
[2:20:09.980 --> 2:20:19.060]  So I don't I I should have predicted that I think they're gonna sell a ton of these bands like especially like the millenies loop is only like
[2:20:19.060 --> 2:20:23.580]  I think it's only 150 bucks. Yeah, 150 which I was surprised by yeah
[2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:27.980]  I think that that's almost like a no-brainer like I think people might be hesitant to buy the
[2:20:29.100 --> 2:20:36.300]  Link bracelet since it's you know, especially like you say I mean you you will be able to just buy the sport watch and get the link bracelet
[2:20:36.300 --> 2:20:41.700]  But I think people who are price sensitive enough to want to go that way aren't gonna want to spend
[2:20:42.380 --> 2:20:46.180]  More on the link bracelet than the watch itself cost. I think you know
[2:20:46.180 --> 2:20:47.620]  I just don't think that's gonna come up much
[2:20:47.620 --> 2:20:53.220]  I'm sure you know that some people will do it, but I think it's it's not even worth worrying about in terms of you know
[2:20:53.220 --> 2:20:57.740]  Should out should Apple have strategic, you know done something to try to prevent it. Mm-hmm
[2:20:58.020 --> 2:21:00.860]  Yeah, I think you're right and well the more I look at it
[2:21:00.860 --> 2:21:02.020]  I mean the millenies
[2:21:02.020 --> 2:21:06.180]  I've noticed actually a lot of people from Apple wearing those. It seems to be pretty popular and
[2:21:07.060 --> 2:21:09.900]  the ease of which it goes on and off and
[2:21:09.940 --> 2:21:14.340]  Like like a kind of classiness of it. I think it could be the dress band of choice
[2:21:14.580 --> 2:21:20.260]  Yeah, for a lot of these people that buy like a sport or by even a steel with a sport band
[2:21:20.260 --> 2:21:27.500]  You know because because of the cost it could be the dress band of choice for the masses and I think that it's it definitely has maybe a
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:29.140]  more
[2:21:29.140 --> 2:21:33.780]  High-fashion appeal because the millenies bracelet unless you were a watch fanatic
[2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:37.140]  You probably never even knew the name even if you saw it in a casing or whatever
[2:21:37.500 --> 2:21:40.420]  But it's obviously a very classic bracelet. It's been around a lot of years
[2:21:40.580 --> 2:21:44.900]  But I just think that it may actually have a nice dressy shiny metal feel
[2:21:45.620 --> 2:21:47.620]  For people that don't want to spend the
[2:21:48.340 --> 2:21:52.780]  $450 for the steel bracelet. I think that's actually gonna be a popular dress one
[2:21:52.980 --> 2:21:58.980]  Yeah, and if you're the sort of person who's fussy about having something sized perfectly and I am like
[2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:03.460]  And I you know in my life. I've always worn watches and there's been a lot of times in my life where I've bought a watch and
[2:22:04.020 --> 2:22:10.780]  Found that there are like two holes, you know like with a classic buckle and ones a little too tight and the other ones a little too loose
[2:22:10.780 --> 2:22:15.620]  And I've always you know it regret that they're you know like whoever designed to watch
[2:22:16.340 --> 2:22:21.980]  Bait this strap hadn't moved the holes like half a click to the you know up or down
[2:22:23.220 --> 2:22:28.340]  The millenies loop it doesn't have that problem because it's it's you can size it to exactly
[2:22:28.340 --> 2:22:35.380]  You know where once one size fits also speaker continues adjustable right anybody who's fussy about that is you know
[2:22:35.380 --> 2:22:37.380]  Gonna love that as a size ability thing
[2:22:39.620 --> 2:22:41.300]  I
[2:22:41.300 --> 2:22:42.980]  Think the other thing
[2:22:42.980 --> 2:22:48.140]  I guess I wanted to talk about is the timing of the event and I know there were a lot of questions going in like well
[2:22:48.140 --> 2:22:55.220]  If they've been saying April, but then why are they holding this event on March 9th and the answer is I don't know
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:22:57.780]  Oh, even after the event, right like I
[2:22:58.980 --> 2:23:02.660]  Not quite sure so the timing is they had this event on March 9th
[2:23:03.540 --> 2:23:07.260]  The next date is April 10th
[2:23:07.380 --> 2:23:15.060]  Which is when they are going to start taking pre-orders and when they're going to have watches in Apple stores to look at
[2:23:16.020 --> 2:23:23.420]  And then the next date is April 24th, which is when they're gonna start shipping and selling am I I think I have all the right?
[2:23:23.420 --> 2:23:27.660]  Yeah, those are the dates. Yeah. Um, so why hold the event
[2:23:28.780 --> 2:23:34.060]  What seven weeks in advance of a month in advance of pre-orders and?
[2:23:35.740 --> 2:23:38.220]  one two three four
[2:23:39.740 --> 2:23:42.860]  five six weeks before it chips I
[2:23:43.780 --> 2:23:50.700]  Don't I don't get it I don't either and I mean my mind so my mind's totally blank on this issue
[2:23:50.700 --> 2:23:56.780]  So I the only thing I can I can spitball on this to use your phrase is that
[2:23:57.260 --> 2:24:01.340]  They might be trying to give reviewers a bigger window
[2:24:02.380 --> 2:24:04.380]  Um
[2:24:04.380 --> 2:24:08.380]  As far as I know review units weren't issued for these watches yet
[2:24:09.020 --> 2:24:13.900]  But I mean I certainly don't have one. I'll probably say that although if I did have one I would probably say the same thing
[2:24:14.380 --> 2:24:19.180]  But um, well you wouldn't you'd say nothing. No, that's right. You're right. I would say nothing
[2:24:19.180 --> 2:24:24.700]  So yeah, I don't have one um, so but it would seem to me like they maybe they want to give people more time with them
[2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:29.020]  Because they feel that there's more time, but that's literally they'll and then I'm speaking not as a person who
[2:24:29.340 --> 2:24:31.900]  I'm not assuming that I'm gonna get a review. You know, I never do
[2:24:31.900 --> 2:24:36.860]  I've only ever gotten one review thing and I think it was probably an accident. Let me probably include me on or on a list
[2:24:38.940 --> 2:24:42.300]  But I just speaking as an interested party like anybody else
[2:24:42.460 --> 2:24:43.820]  I'm thinking
[2:24:43.820 --> 2:24:46.460]  What if you want to give people more time to live with these things
[2:24:46.460 --> 2:24:50.380]  Before they write a review of them rather than the traditional one-week window
[2:24:50.700 --> 2:24:52.460]  And I know they like to keep that window tight
[2:24:52.460 --> 2:24:57.020]  But look at the distance between say the pre-order and the sale. That's a lot of time, you know
[2:24:57.740 --> 2:25:02.060]  So I don't know. Yeah, I don't know it might be different because like hey
[2:25:02.700 --> 2:25:07.660]  Reviewing a new phone. You know what an iPhone does. You know you've been out for six years
[2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:12.860]  You don't need more than eight days to review it because all you're really reviewing is what's new which
[2:25:13.660 --> 2:25:15.660]  Like this year was it's bigger
[2:25:15.660 --> 2:25:20.140]  Touch ID or or pay Apple pay and you know
[2:25:20.700 --> 2:25:24.220]  How good is the new camera? You know you can do that in a week and maybe like you're right
[2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:26.220]  Maybe like this all-new platform
[2:25:26.460 --> 2:25:31.820]  You know a new way to get through your day of interacting with your devices and staying connected
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:36.300]  You might need more time. I can honestly say this is you know the weird thing by me not having been at the event
[2:25:37.900 --> 2:25:40.700]  You know, I do not have a review unit nor have I
[2:25:41.260 --> 2:25:44.940]  Talk to anybody at Apple about getting one so you know
[2:25:44.940 --> 2:25:46.940]  I'm completely in the dark as to
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:52.780]  Whether anybody has one whether I'm going to get one and if if I did when you know at some point
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:54.780]  I might have to shut up and stop talking if I do
[2:25:55.340 --> 2:25:59.420]  It's just like a warrant canary. We're like the company they take it off their website and you're like oh my god
[2:25:59.740 --> 2:26:02.460]  The NSA is like it is a hit of up for info
[2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:06.620]  Yeah, sort of I guess I guess I guess you can just keep listening to the talk for and see if I say
[2:26:07.100 --> 2:26:11.980]  I don't have a review unit Apple watch nor have I been told that that I'm getting one
[2:26:11.980 --> 2:26:17.660]  So I don't know I would be very very surprised if anybody has one
[2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:21.980]  Right now. I just don't think that they would give them out six weeks in advance
[2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:27.820]  It just would be so unlike them. I wouldn't be surprised if maybe they give if they see them April 10
[2:26:28.140 --> 2:26:29.420]  You know
[2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:31.580]  two weeks in advance
[2:26:31.820 --> 2:26:34.860]  And get which would be a little bit more time than they usually do but
[2:26:35.740 --> 2:26:40.940]  I don't know and and the other thing that's weird about it is in my experience getting review units since
[2:26:40.940 --> 2:26:42.940]  2011
[2:26:44.220 --> 2:26:52.300]  Every time I've ever gotten a review unit of any product from Apple bigs, you know, flagship or minor upgrade
[2:26:53.340 --> 2:26:56.780]  It's been given to me in person
[2:26:57.580 --> 2:27:00.460]  And they don't just ship them although well
[2:27:01.100 --> 2:27:05.020]  I have heard of the shipping review units, but I don't know that it's ever been a new cat
[2:27:05.020 --> 2:27:07.020]  Well, it's never been a new category product
[2:27:07.020 --> 2:27:11.100]  It was like, you know, I like an upgrade to something or whatever. I have heard of them doing that
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:16.940]  Yeah, I've gotten them for software products like they've sent me like a review unit with
[2:27:19.580 --> 2:27:25.580]  The Yosemite public beta on it so that you know, it's weird. It's like they do it. Yeah, right
[2:27:25.580 --> 2:27:33.100]  That makes sense because it's not like the object itself. It's the software. Yeah, right and it was shipping on a totally bog standard
[2:27:33.100 --> 2:27:38.860]  You know MacBook Pro. It's just a funny thing that they say I think they make a list of who they want to send them to and
[2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:42.940]  Based on you know, whatever criteria and then I made the list and they sent it
[2:27:43.100 --> 2:27:48.700]  But it's just funny because I was already running the Yosemite public beta on my actual MacBook because I'm in the developer program
[2:27:48.700 --> 2:27:51.580]  And I know how to do it in a I know I know the risks
[2:27:51.660 --> 2:27:54.860]  But I know you know they do it for a good reason that they don't want you know
[2:27:55.500 --> 2:27:57.500]  typical journalists
[2:27:57.340 --> 2:28:02.220]  Risking, you know screwing up their MacBook by putting a public beta on it. Sure. Yeah
[2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:05.740]  But I just know way they're just gonna shoot me this
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:10.140]  But if they haven't given them now, there's a chance I could get I will not there's no way
[2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:16.860]  I'm gonna be able to fly before April 24th. So if you know if there are review units
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:19.420]  I know but I don't think they're gonna have another event
[2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:21.420]  So I don't think there would be any reason to fly
[2:28:21.420 --> 2:28:25.820]  So maybe they'll hold briefings in New York like they sometimes to and I could do that
[2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:31.340]  So I can take a train. I just can't fly. Yeah, I mean if they did it separate from an event
[2:28:31.340 --> 2:28:33.820]  Because normally they do these things away from an event, right?
[2:28:34.060 --> 2:28:38.060]  So if they're out of an event rather so if they're doing it away from an event
[2:28:38.060 --> 2:28:40.700]  It would be a similar thing to where they help briefings
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:44.620]  You know in New York for wherever it was Mavericks or
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:49.740]  Yeah, yeah, and there was a bunch of people invited to that and they just be the trip to the city from wherever they were
[2:28:49.820 --> 2:28:53.980]  Or if they were in the city they came in on there was several schedule throughout the day
[2:28:53.980 --> 2:28:55.180]  So they could
[2:28:55.180 --> 2:29:03.420]  I feasibly do that, but it would seem to me that it would limit their ability to talk to the people or give them to the people
[2:29:03.420 --> 2:29:08.700]  That they wanted to because I'm sure the reviewers are scattered everywhere. It's not just journalists. I have I would
[2:29:09.260 --> 2:29:15.660]  It would be insanely shocked if they gave an addition to a journalist and not to a watchmaker or not watchmaker
[2:29:15.660 --> 2:29:18.140]  But a watch reviewer right like a high-end
[2:29:18.140 --> 2:29:26.220]  Fashion reviewer or watch reviewer. I could see them giving an addition model to them to evaluate from that perspective
[2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:30.220]  I actually see two two new areas where I would be surprised if they don't
[2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:33.180]  I'm I would say it's dead certain
[2:29:33.660 --> 2:29:39.980]  The one I would bet money on is that they will seed review units to fashion people like
[2:29:40.380 --> 2:29:44.620]  Vogue or you know, I don't know enough about the fashion world to say who would get them
[2:29:44.620 --> 2:29:47.180]  You know, but like vogue GQ
[2:29:48.620 --> 2:29:50.620]  Magazines like that
[2:29:50.780 --> 2:29:55.660]  From the fashion world, but that's not this is our the watch world not like the watch what you know like the
[2:29:56.220 --> 2:29:59.900]  Ben climber Hadinky type guys, but I think they'll probably seed them to them too
[2:29:59.980 --> 2:30:04.780]  But I think it's more certain that they'd give it to the fashion people and a little less certain that they'd give it to the watch people
[2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:07.500]  Because I feel like the watch people are still sort of
[2:30:08.540 --> 2:30:10.700]  There's a sort of you know, this is interesting
[2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:18.140]  But it's not really a watch watch because you know, it's the mechanics of a mechanical watch that are so big a part of the obsession
[2:30:18.620 --> 2:30:24.380]  And everything else is in celery. It's really the movements and the creation of that that we're interested in
[2:30:24.700 --> 2:30:27.100]  Yeah, but I don't know I but I if I had to bet though
[2:30:27.100 --> 2:30:29.100]  I bet a little bit less than the fashion people
[2:30:29.100 --> 2:30:34.940]  But I would bet that give it to him too because the one thing that is mechanical are the bands and I know just from talking to Ben
[2:30:34.940 --> 2:30:41.420]  Climber at the last event. They're super super interesting to the watch people because they've really you know in a lot of ways
[2:30:41.420 --> 2:30:43.820]  Like the modern buckle and the link bracelet
[2:30:45.020 --> 2:30:47.340]  They've really like shown up the watch world
[2:30:47.340 --> 2:30:52.380]  You know if the if the link bracelet holds up and there's a question about that because link bracelets
[2:30:52.460 --> 2:30:58.540]  You know traditionally that it's called stretch where if you get like an old in older Rolex is suffering
[2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:07.660]  If you buy like a vintage Rolex usually the band is it the bracelet is loose. It it jangles a little just because over time
[2:31:07.740 --> 2:31:11.420]  You know, it just the the connections between the links get stretched
[2:31:12.060 --> 2:31:15.420]  And the company is like Rolex and and Omega
[2:31:15.580 --> 2:31:20.460]  You know the higher end ones have gotten good at that over the years and they make bracelets that last a lot longer now
[2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:28.220]  Apple's brand knew it so there's a question as to whether the link bracelet one year later is going to still be just as tight
[2:31:28.220 --> 2:31:30.220]  as it was when you bought it
[2:31:30.540 --> 2:31:33.820]  But the engineering that went into it is insane assuming that it is though
[2:31:33.820 --> 2:31:39.020]  They've they've totally shown them up like the way that you can adjust it and take links off without a special tool is
[2:31:39.740 --> 2:31:41.740]  groundbreaking and the clasp
[2:31:42.620 --> 2:31:46.300]  Is way better the clasp on the apple link bracelet is way better than
[2:31:46.780 --> 2:31:51.420]  Mechanically as it been in terms of cleverness then the clasp on a Rolex
[2:31:52.780 --> 2:31:55.580]  So that's that's why I think they'll probably give it to the watch people
[2:31:55.580 --> 2:31:59.740]  I think the watch people will probably spend more time writing about the bracelets than they will the
[2:32:00.620 --> 2:32:02.620]  the software
[2:32:04.780 --> 2:32:10.460]  So I know I really it's so funny that they held this event that I I went into it thinking that they were going to answer
[2:32:10.620 --> 2:32:15.980]  Just about all my question and and they honestly they I feel like they answered almost none of them really
[2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:20.780]  I mean or at least fewer than half I still have no idea when they're going to see reviewing it's if they're
[2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:24.780]  I feel like they have to right they're not going to let this thing ship without having anybody review it
[2:32:24.780 --> 2:32:27.500]  I mean that would that would look so the optics would look so bad
[2:32:27.500 --> 2:32:32.940]  It's like when they release a movie and they they don't the review embargo drops the day before and it was like oh
[2:32:32.940 --> 2:32:37.820]  Yeah, this is gonna be great right. Yeah, that would be it would
[2:32:38.380 --> 2:32:44.860]  It would be yeah because because if they don't give review in it and I just say this saying not take myself out of it
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:46.700]  I don't feel entitled to one. I don't know
[2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:49.180]  I never know whether I'm gonna get a review or not
[2:32:49.180 --> 2:32:54.860]  I my guess that I might is only based on the fact that I've gotten review units of everything for the last few years
[2:32:54.940 --> 2:32:56.700]  but if I'd ever stopped if you know
[2:32:56.700 --> 2:33:01.420]  I just never get a call and you know April 10th and 24th come and go
[2:33:01.420 --> 2:33:03.100]  You know, I'll just buy one you know
[2:33:03.100 --> 2:33:08.500]  I I did just find you know in the years before I got reviewing it's I'll just buy one and evaluate it
[2:33:08.500 --> 2:33:13.500]  But I'm gonna write about it either way, right? It's just a question of when it'll the review will come out and
[2:33:13.500 --> 2:33:19.260]  And everybody else will like that'll be true for everybody everybody who wants to review the Apple watch is gonna review it
[2:33:19.260 --> 2:33:25.100]  Whether they have to wait to buy one April 24th or not so I can't see why they wouldn't give review units if
[2:33:25.660 --> 2:33:31.900]  You know, but when and how total mystery right so I mean the the thing to me about it
[2:33:32.140 --> 2:33:35.660]  The reason that the more timing makes sense is because it is a new category
[2:33:35.820 --> 2:33:37.980]  You have to think about it a little differently and there
[2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:40.860]  If they give people more time to think on it
[2:33:40.860 --> 2:33:46.940]  I think that they'll be better off because if they did wait and just everybody bought one and and evaluated it
[2:33:46.940 --> 2:33:48.940]  Everybody's gonna be in this mad rush
[2:33:49.100 --> 2:33:51.340]  to write about it and they mean
[2:33:52.140 --> 2:33:57.740]  If Apple feels that you need to live with it to let it simmer before you start to see the value in it
[2:33:57.740 --> 2:33:59.980]  Then they make sense for them to give you more time
[2:33:59.980 --> 2:34:01.500]  You're that's such a good point
[2:34:01.500 --> 2:34:04.700]  I didn't even think about that because I'm never in a rush to be first
[2:34:04.700 --> 2:34:08.060]  So I wasn't even thinking that but so many other people are you're right
[2:34:08.060 --> 2:34:14.860]  What what will happen if they don't see the review units is people will buy it like when the Apple store opens on
[2:34:15.260 --> 2:34:20.220]  April 24th or noon or whenever they say they're gonna start selling them and they're gonna try to publish a review like two hours
[2:34:20.700 --> 2:34:24.220]  Oh, sure. Yeah, it'll be a rush. I mean just speaking of somebody who is it
[2:34:24.300 --> 2:34:30.700]  Yeah, we're at a different position like the instant the embargo drops like we are under pressure to publish because
[2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:34.380]  That initial that the capture of initial attention
[2:34:34.380 --> 2:34:37.740]  You know, that's that's important to a publication, right?
[2:34:38.060 --> 2:34:43.500]  And so everybody's gonna be rushing to get that and if there is no holds barred like no embargo
[2:34:43.820 --> 2:34:48.140]  Everybody's just gonna be pushing really and nearly they're gonna be publishing all kinds of wackadoo
[2:34:49.100 --> 2:34:53.660]  Hack job reviews, right? And like you know, I give my my writers just for context
[2:34:53.660 --> 2:34:58.060]  They give my writers permission to publish whenever they want on this stuff. I don't I've not sitting there over
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:34:59.100]  Their shoulder are you done with this?
[2:34:59.100 --> 2:35:01.100]  We've got to publish one of the embargo drops usually
[2:35:01.100 --> 2:35:07.020]  It's ready because like Darryl usually does our reviews. He does a great job and he's very conscientious and and takes care of business, right?
[2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:12.940]  But my philosophy on it is published when it's ready not when everybody else is and like last time
[2:35:12.940 --> 2:35:15.740]  I published my review like the next day or something, right?
[2:35:16.140 --> 2:35:21.820]  And I'm totally fine with that 100% philosophically, but a lot of publications are not at all right?
[2:35:21.900 --> 2:35:27.100]  They're like get it out now immediately. I don't care what state it's in finish it and so
[2:35:27.100 --> 2:35:30.380]  You're only gonna exacerbate that issue if you
[2:35:31.660 --> 2:35:34.140]  Just let it drop and everybody just
[2:35:34.860 --> 2:35:40.380]  To crap out like cat jobs about the watch. Yeah, it'll be curious so I'm curious to see
[2:35:40.380 --> 2:35:42.380]  I'm gonna assume that they will
[2:35:42.380 --> 2:35:45.340]  Seed review in it. It'll be curious to see whether it's
[2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:52.380]  More limited than usual because they want to be careful about who has reviews for the embargo dropping whenever their
[2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:57.580]  Embargo dates gonna be I presume typically it's like the Tuesday or Wednesday before the Friday that they ship
[2:35:58.060 --> 2:36:00.060]  Or if it'll be more
[2:36:01.180 --> 2:36:04.300]  And you know like it like not more inclusive than than usual
[2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:09.900]  But as inclusive as like the iPhones and iPads have been lately where they've really cast a wider net
[2:36:12.620 --> 2:36:14.620]  I think strategically is
[2:36:14.620 --> 2:36:20.780]  It's sort of like the new open Apple and I think it is a little bit its confidence in the products and that they
[2:36:20.780 --> 2:36:29.260]  It's actually to me less risky because if they're confident in the product then the consensus of the reviews will get it right
[2:36:29.660 --> 2:36:37.100]  And one bad review won't sync it whereas to me it's dangerous to do it like they did with the original iPhone like where there
[2:36:37.100 --> 2:36:41.260]  Were only I think there were only four people who had review units. There was pogue Mossberg
[2:36:43.660 --> 2:36:48.700]  Steven Levy had one from Newsweek and I think Ed Begg for USA today
[2:36:48.700 --> 2:36:50.700]  I'm not sure about it Ed, but I
[2:36:51.340 --> 2:36:55.580]  Those are the only four people I think who had review units for the original iPhone
[2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:58.620]  So if even one of them had had a bad experience with it
[2:36:59.100 --> 2:37:02.220]  You know that could that would have been like 25% of the reviews
[2:37:02.540 --> 2:37:05.580]  You know this thing's no good. Yeah, they're rotten tomato score goes way down
[2:37:05.660 --> 2:37:09.660]  Right, but if you have 70 people doing it and you know three of them didn't like it
[2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:13.740]  It's not we deal right. So I don't know. I'm to be curious to see
[2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:18.060]  But it's I feel like they're so different in so many ways these days that it's it's fun
[2:37:18.060 --> 2:37:20.420]  But it makes it means it's a lot harder to predict
[2:37:21.500 --> 2:37:25.260]  All right, I guess we should wrap up, but I one thing we haven't even touched on is the addition
[2:37:26.060 --> 2:37:33.740]  Oh, geez. Yeah. Yeah. What do you what do you think? Oh, did you kick that off? What do you think? Well? I think I was right
[2:37:35.020 --> 2:37:39.980]  Yeah, you were you were you nailed the I mean you you guessed 10,000 for starting right right?
[2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:41.020]  I know you know
[2:37:41.020 --> 2:37:44.540]  I think I talked myself down from it with the rubber band because I
[2:37:44.540 --> 2:37:51.420]  I've still confused by this but that it just seems to me so incongruous that a $10,000 watch would have
[2:37:51.660 --> 2:37:56.540]  Effectively the same band as the $400 one. Yes, I know that the pin is made out of solid gold
[2:37:58.060 --> 2:38:03.500]  But it just seems like a weird play to me that they don't that they didn't do what I thought they might do
[2:38:03.500 --> 2:38:07.980]  Which is have a gold link bracelet and a gold millenies and charge form
[2:38:09.260 --> 2:38:12.620]  Maybe they just aren't ready or maybe they couldn't exit on them or maybe you know
[2:38:12.620 --> 2:38:15.100]  Maybe they're not maybe you know the people who are speculating it
[2:38:15.100 --> 2:38:18.060]  Maybe the gold is too hard to work into those shapes are true
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:22.060]  I don't know but it just seems to me like they're leaving money on the table if anything though
[2:38:22.060 --> 2:38:26.980]  It means that my pricing was actually low because if they do come out with a link bracelet
[2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:31.100]  In gold. I think it's gonna be 30,000 or maybe 40 not
[2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:34.940]  because they're charging 17 for the
[2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:37.740]  modern buckle
[2:38:37.740 --> 2:38:40.460]  That modern buckle the more I look at it. I mean, I know this is like
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:47.180]  The there's like the most obvious statement in the world, but that red leather with yellow gold is so
[2:38:47.740 --> 2:38:54.780]  Clearly aimed at China and I'm there might be women all over the world who are itching to get that because it's cool
[2:38:54.780 --> 2:38:58.140]  Looking thing, but I mean, it's like literally the colors of the Chinese flag
[2:38:58.140 --> 2:39:02.060]  I mean everything you know like Chinese New Year is you know everything's red and gold
[2:39:03.100 --> 2:39:09.100]  That is so clearly if you had to ask me what the primary market for the edition is it's not rich people in America
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:11.100]  It's rich people in China
[2:39:11.420 --> 2:39:13.020]  That's my opinion, right?
[2:39:13.020 --> 2:39:16.300]  That's just one person's opinion. So don't this is not some grand pronouncement
[2:39:16.300 --> 2:39:21.500]  But I really think that a significant portion of edition sales will be there and I think Apple expects them to be there
[2:39:22.540 --> 2:39:29.580]  Because there is money in China and there is an intense focus on status and this concept of like face of of having
[2:39:30.060 --> 2:39:33.740]  You know status through possessions and through gifts and that sort of thing
[2:39:33.900 --> 2:39:36.860]  So I think that there's definitely going to be an enormous market for it there
[2:39:36.860 --> 2:39:40.620]  I don't think it's just rich dudes in America who want to show off status
[2:39:40.620 --> 2:39:43.260]  I think it's rich rich I shouldn't say dudes
[2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:45.820]  But rich people everywhere that want to show off status, you know
[2:39:45.820 --> 2:39:50.060]  And I think that that is there's going to be a big market for it outside of the
[2:39:50.700 --> 2:39:56.380]  The billionaires who want to pronounce their billionaireness here, you know, it's going to be everywhere
[2:39:56.700 --> 2:40:00.220]  Yeah, and it's you know, it's definitely a cultural difference to where
[2:40:01.100 --> 2:40:03.500]  You know here there's an awful
[2:40:03.500 --> 2:40:05.820]  I they're definitely going to sell so many United States
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:07.500]  No, I mean they're going to sell some everywhere
[2:40:07.500 --> 2:40:13.180]  But in terms of what it says when you see somebody who's wearing one a lot of people and I'm sure you know
[2:40:13.180 --> 2:40:15.340]  The the tech-minded audience of this show
[2:40:15.340 --> 2:40:18.300]  There's a lot of people out there who are listening to art a speak right now
[2:40:18.620 --> 2:40:21.580]  Who are going to think exactly what I'm going to say which is let's say you're out
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:23.580]  You see somebody in
[2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:26.300]  At the bar next to you and you see holy shit
[2:40:26.300 --> 2:40:29.660]  That's a gold apple watch and your first thought is going to be douchebag
[2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:31.660]  Exactly
[2:40:32.140 --> 2:40:38.540]  Yeah, in a show though that's it's not the case. It's you know ostentatious displays of wealth have a different cultural
[2:40:39.020 --> 2:40:41.020]  connotation than they do here
[2:40:41.820 --> 2:40:43.820]  It's like the concept of fitness
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:48.700]  How that's changed like in roman times if you were fit that meant you were a fieldworker, right?
[2:40:48.940 --> 2:40:51.500]  And if you were you know relatively, you know
[2:40:51.580 --> 2:40:53.580]  corpulent or or or full
[2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:59.420]  Figured as a man or woman that meant you had leisure time and you had the wealth to have other people do your
[2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:05.180]  Manual labor for you know, you know, and to to have the ability, you know food itself, you know was a luxury
[2:41:06.140 --> 2:41:08.460]  Mm-hmm, right totally. I agree with that
[2:41:10.700 --> 2:41:11.500]  I
[2:41:11.500 --> 2:41:16.220]  I thought it was I thought it was almost baffling how little they talked about addition and
[2:41:17.340 --> 2:41:25.180]  Idea I was we do and I hate to say this because I could be totally wrong. This is 100% speculation on my part
[2:41:25.180 --> 2:41:27.180]  but I sense
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:31.180]  Conflict and internal conflict and disarray among their ranks
[2:41:31.740 --> 2:41:36.460]  With regard to how little they talked about it because it clearly was not cut for time
[2:41:36.460 --> 2:41:41.300]  The event was only 88 minutes long and two hours is the limit on on an apple event
[2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:43.620]  I mean, that's you know, obviously if they wanted to go more than two hours
[2:41:43.620 --> 2:41:48.300]  I could but I know that internally they shoot for two hours or less and like the September event
[2:41:48.860 --> 2:41:52.420]  Clocked in at exactly two hours and that was you know, they clipped stuff
[2:41:52.420 --> 2:41:58.300]  That was very very very clipped in terms of you know, we have to do the we have to do three things these new phones
[2:41:58.300 --> 2:42:02.060]  Apple pay and the watch and we got a squeeze you to in at the end
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:05.020]  It was hard and they
[2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:11.580]  But they could have and so for example, this it they they talked about
[2:42:12.180 --> 2:42:15.700]  Sport and then they had a little Johnny I video talking about how they make the aluminum
[2:42:15.700 --> 2:42:23.340]  Then they talked about Apple watch and they had a little Johnny I video talking about the steel and then Tim Cook said
[2:42:23.340 --> 2:42:27.700]  You know like three sentences about addition and then the event was over there is a video
[2:42:27.700 --> 2:42:33.140]  It's on Apple's website. There's a video the exact same style of Johnny. I've talked about how they make the gold
[2:42:33.140 --> 2:42:37.220]  I mean, why they didn't show that in the event is baffling to me
[2:42:37.500 --> 2:42:42.700]  Yep, like why not bry if you're gonna brag about how you made some aluminum? Why in the world wouldn't you brag about how you made the gold?
[2:42:42.700 --> 2:42:51.100]  I cannot help but feel that there is some kind of disagreement there about the messaging exactly along the lines of what us on the outside
[2:42:51.100 --> 2:42:57.820]  Have been saying all along that this seems like it's not at you know selling $17,000 watches doesn't seem like Apple
[2:42:58.380 --> 2:43:05.100]  Exactly. Yeah, and I mean my argument on it is is that if you have a gold watch
[2:43:05.820 --> 2:43:08.580]  That works exactly the same as a lower and watch
[2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:15.660]  Then there's two ways to look at it you can look at it from the person who buys the aluminum and says that gold watch works
[2:43:15.660 --> 2:43:19.060]  Exactly the same as mine that person who bought it as an idiot, right?
[2:43:19.060 --> 2:43:23.060]  Right or you can be the gold the person who has the money to buy the gold watch now
[2:43:23.060 --> 2:43:27.020]  I don't ascribe to this whole false argument like oh you could buy this or you could buy
[2:43:27.260 --> 2:43:31.620]  You know, you could contribute to charity because anybody who has this kind of money can spend money on anything they want
[2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:34.180]  Right this is not a person who scrimps and saves
[2:43:34.180 --> 2:43:40.100]  $10,000 to buy a watch. This is a person who for $10,000 is maybe not throw away money
[2:43:40.100 --> 2:43:43.500]  But it's certainly not a problem to spend this kind of money, right?
[2:43:43.700 --> 2:43:47.620]  So they buy this watch and they put it on and it works exactly the same as the lower in one
[2:43:47.620 --> 2:43:50.020]  But they look at the person with the aluminum and go
[2:43:50.740 --> 2:43:57.900]  Oh, I'm so glad I could afford the gold and I think that what that comes down to is you've got this argument both ways up and down
[2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:03.620]  And it comes down to how it makes you feel like that's the pro argument for the having the gold
[2:44:03.620 --> 2:44:07.580]  It's if it makes you feel better where it works exactly the same as the other one
[2:44:07.580 --> 2:44:10.740]  So we're not short-changing the person who can only afford the aluminum
[2:44:10.820 --> 2:44:16.580]  You know the people who are saying oh well if it had another sensor or another this or another that I would buy it
[2:44:16.580 --> 2:44:23.700]  I would spend more money on it, but to me that would be anti-apple that would be a very unappel thing to do to make the
[2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:26.260]  the one whose
[2:44:26.260 --> 2:44:31.500]  materials were more expensive work better as well and instead
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:38.580]  You know, they're saying no, you can buy whatever you want. It's up to you. Here you go. Yeah, I I I
[2:44:39.060 --> 2:44:43.260]  I've you know as my my predictions have been high for the price of addition all along
[2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:49.500]  And I've not been opposed to it in and of itself just because the price is high
[2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:57.980]  Because to me the people who are so upset about it and feel like that it's a sign that Apple has changed
[2:44:57.980 --> 2:45:03.980]  Inevate, you know it for the worse as a company and that they don't stand for what they used to stand all of those arguments to me
[2:45:04.300 --> 2:45:08.500]  All sound as though the Apple watch sport doesn't exist
[2:45:09.260 --> 2:45:13.900]  You know like if this and quite frankly given the the
[2:45:15.100 --> 2:45:17.740]  $550 starting price for the steel I
[2:45:18.620 --> 2:45:23.820]  Actually think it would be fine then if the sport didn't if the sport didn't exist this year and the starting price was the
[2:45:23.820 --> 2:45:28.220]  Five 40 the five hundred fifty six hundred dollar steel version
[2:45:28.220 --> 2:45:30.540]  I actually think that's not bad either because that's you know
[2:45:30.540 --> 2:45:33.660]  That's where like the iPhone started at six hundred dollars
[2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:40.460]  But the fact is there is one for three hundred and fifty four hundred dollars and so I don't understand the the argument that it's
[2:45:41.260 --> 2:45:45.180]  That the price of the gold one alone is any kind of a bad sign because like you and again
[2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:49.580]  Because they're functionally equivalent. I feel like it's a egalitarian downright
[2:45:49.580 --> 2:45:53.340]  I am not put off by the price at all. I don't I don't it you know
[2:45:53.340 --> 2:45:55.740]  I think they're gonna sell them and why not I think they're you know
[2:45:55.740 --> 2:45:56.540]  It's interesting
[2:45:56.540 --> 2:45:58.780]  And I don't think they had to I think that if they had
[2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:05.740]  Likewise if they had shipped Apple watch and never done the gold one and the most expensive model was the space black steel one
[2:46:06.140 --> 2:46:09.900]  That would have been fine too. I don't think anybody would say they've botched it
[2:46:10.220 --> 2:46:13.420]  I think it's interesting, but the price doesn't bother me and I
[2:46:13.420 --> 2:46:20.540]  I've bothered by the fact that they seem uncomfortable talking about mm-hmm that they're up two minds about it
[2:46:20.540 --> 2:46:25.980]  Right like you if you're gonna do it own it like if you're gonna offer a gold fancy model
[2:46:26.300 --> 2:46:31.740]  Because you want it to appeal to people who have this amount of money to spend just say
[2:46:32.220 --> 2:46:37.740]  Some people like nicer things so nicer metals or maybe not even nicer is the wrong word for it
[2:46:37.740 --> 2:46:42.460]  But whatever some people like these materials so we're offering it, but don't like be ashamed of
[2:46:42.460 --> 2:46:47.980]  Right, so a lot of people a lot of people have been saying to me like with my $10,000 starting price
[2:46:49.100 --> 2:46:51.100]  Two arguments I heard
[2:46:51.100 --> 2:46:56.460]  One of them was somebody a couple people told me, you know, you know this because you're in San Francisco
[2:46:57.180 --> 2:46:59.180]  Or you know tech crunches in San Francisco
[2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:04.460]  But you know that there's a lot of Apple employees have been spotted wearing Apple watch for the last couple months out and about
[2:47:05.100 --> 2:47:10.060]  And I've got an email some people who've seen people wearing gold ones
[2:47:10.060 --> 2:47:16.460]  So they're like well, that's obviously not going to be $10,000 because what company would give an employee a $10,000 watch
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:20.140]  To wear as a test unit and my answer to them is always
[2:47:20.860 --> 2:47:22.860]  Apple
[2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:28.860]  Exactly like that was not proof that the thing was not $10,000 like Apple has some money, you know
[2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:35.180]  And also Apple's cost is not $10,000 like the watch doesn't cause $9,000 to make
[2:47:37.020 --> 2:47:39.020]  but
[2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:41.020]  the other thing that
[2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:43.020]  People have said is well
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:47.740]  How are they going to announce that price? You really think Tim Cook is going to stand in front of a slide that reads 999
[2:47:47.980 --> 2:47:49.500]  And also it's interesting to me
[2:47:49.500 --> 2:47:53.980]  I should have predicted that they're not going with 999 pricing. It's $10,000
[2:47:54.220 --> 2:47:55.180]  $17,000
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:57.180]  Very deliberate very little as soon as I saw that
[2:47:57.260 --> 2:47:59.420]  I the first thing I did is I opened up a tab
[2:47:59.580 --> 2:48:06.740]  I went to Tiffany.com and started browsing around and that's how Tiffany charges to like if you buy a $17,000 bracelet
[2:48:06.740 --> 2:48:09.620]  At Tiffany, it's $170,000
[2:48:09.620 --> 2:48:13.060]  Yeah, and every other watch is 999,000
[2:48:13.060 --> 2:48:16.500]  Yeah, or 9,000 like every other watch they offer
[2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:19.220]  Apple watches but the additions are not
[2:48:19.220 --> 2:48:26.180]  Right, I should have predicted that once you you know at that level the unit is not the dollar the unit is the
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:32.340]  $1,000 it's how many thousand dollars and that's just the unit that people who are going to buy that think in
[2:48:32.340 --> 2:48:40.180]  But the answer was he didn't stand in front of a slide with any prices. He just said it and it was right
[2:48:40.180 --> 2:48:43.540]  I think it was awkward. I think it was terribly awkward
[2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:51.780]  You know what I would have been better if I mean I know the the name addition was supposed to evoke the fact that this was a special
[2:48:51.780 --> 2:48:55.220]  Edition, but they should have really just labeled it a special addition
[2:48:56.100 --> 2:48:58.660]  Like we don't know how long we're going to offer it. It's exclusive
[2:48:58.660 --> 2:49:02.340]  It's limited quantities, but we love to the process so much that we had to
[2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:05.780]  Such a brilliant way to put it that's perfect Michael. All right Matthew
[2:49:07.300 --> 2:49:09.300]  We've been podcasting too
[2:49:10.260 --> 2:49:14.340]  But yeah, I just think you would know that's a lot of the issues, you know that's perfect framing though
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:18.900]  That is absolutely spot-on perfect framing. We loved it so much. We've loved this
[2:49:18.900 --> 2:49:24.340]  We love this material. We wanted to share it with you, you know and that materials video if you watch the gold
[2:49:24.340 --> 2:49:25.540]  I'm sure you've watched the gold one
[2:49:25.540 --> 2:49:30.260]  I mean it is insane. They mill it out of a block of gold just like they do the aluminum
[2:49:30.500 --> 2:49:35.700]  Whereas like almost all these other watches are cast. Yeah, yeah, but yeah, it's it's a crazy process
[2:49:35.700 --> 2:49:37.700]  so they should have just
[2:49:37.620 --> 2:49:43.540]  Stood on the process which ironically is what they did like with the MacBook when they went all aluminum
[2:49:44.260 --> 2:49:48.260]  You know, they stood on top of the process and said we're charging
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:51.060]  This much for this thing because look at all this effort
[2:49:51.060 --> 2:49:56.180]  We put into it. Yeah, and so you could they could have done the same thing here and I think there was a missed opportunity there for them
[2:49:56.180 --> 2:50:01.940]  Just to say it's this is a separate thing. It's special. It's expensive
[2:50:02.900 --> 2:50:07.300]  All these other things do the exact same thing, but we just wanted you to see this awesome thing
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:12.580]  We were able to construct and we think you might enjoy it too, and if you do you can buy it for this much. Yeah
[2:50:14.420 --> 2:50:18.900]  And the last just the last bit of confusion over this is
[2:50:18.900 --> 2:50:21.860]  He did say it'll be limited limited to quantities
[2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:26.500]  And then all he said is it'll be available in select retail stores
[2:50:26.980 --> 2:50:31.940]  And that's it in terms of where now we know about these pop-up stores that if they're putting in like
[2:50:32.580 --> 2:50:34.820]  Paris and I think London to
[2:50:35.620 --> 2:50:40.340]  That are not Apple stores. They're just gonna be like standalone boutiques where you're gonna buy Apple watch
[2:50:41.300 --> 2:50:47.220]  But no explanation is what that means does that mean select Apple stores? He didn't say select Apple stores
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:49.220]  He said select retail stores
[2:50:49.940 --> 2:50:56.740]  And that's crazy, but it looks like it is and then further craziness. It looks like they're going to sell them on online
[2:50:58.180 --> 2:51:03.860]  Yeah, I mean it says select their select buttons right when you go to the buy watch by the additions
[2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:06.260]  So it seems like you could buy them online
[2:51:06.900 --> 2:51:13.060]  So why the select retail stores right? Yeah, and then my only my only thought is they have a limited quantity and they can only allocate
[2:51:13.060 --> 2:51:18.340]  So they're not going to send one watch to every store instead they're going to send their additions to the store
[2:51:18.340 --> 2:51:19.380]  The store in this store
[2:51:19.620 --> 2:51:27.300]  So my feeling on it and I don't know any about this, but it'll be flagship Apple stores and then retail partners that are high-end
[2:51:27.460 --> 2:51:32.900]  Like, you know, whatever Tiffany not Tiffany's but you know those high-end retailers that offer other brands goods
[2:51:35.060 --> 2:51:36.260]  Yeah, it's possible
[2:51:36.660 --> 2:51:42.260]  I doubt that they're going to do it with Tiffany, but Tiffany has sold like Rolexes in the past
[2:51:42.260 --> 2:51:45.540]  They don't right now like they I think the only watches you can get it Tiffany are Tiffany ones
[2:51:45.540 --> 2:51:51.060]  But in the past they've had Rolexes, but then but then it's like they're they're stamped on the dial like they're you know
[2:51:51.140 --> 2:51:56.980]  Collectors items because there's you know, there's a limited number of them. Right. It's a Tiffany's edition Rolex or whatever
[2:51:57.940 --> 2:51:59.940]  I wonder too
[2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:09.780]  I wonder too whether addition with these partners whether there is an as-yet undisclosed thing where they will have their own bands like a
[2:52:09.780 --> 2:52:13.620]  Like this is taught out burberry. You know that maybe
[2:52:14.660 --> 2:52:22.100]  Burberry will sell Apple watch edition in limited locations and you'll be able to get a band that's designed by a burberry instead of Apple
[2:52:23.140 --> 2:52:26.980]  Wow, I mean that would play the exclusive became even further, right?
[2:52:27.380 --> 2:52:33.700]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden Tiffany might make sense too because then maybe Tiffany would do like a Tiffany blue leather band or something
[2:52:33.700 --> 2:52:39.300]  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean, I think it's an indubitable indubital in doubt of whatever
[2:52:39.300 --> 2:52:43.380]  It's you can't doubt. I don't know. I'm we have in podcasting for a long time
[2:52:43.460 --> 2:52:48.900]  But I don't think that there's a doubt that anybody in anybody's mind that we're gonna get third-party bands at some point, right?
[2:52:49.220 --> 2:52:54.020]  And there's some question about whether or not there's gonna be like an authorization program or not or whatever
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:53:00.340]  But we're gonna get third-party bands and I there's no way we're not gonna get high fashion third-party brands from say burberry or whatever
[2:53:00.340 --> 2:53:07.060]  But what about in conjunction with the addition? That's not something I thought of like what if they do say you can buy it at Tiffany's with the Tiffany band
[2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:11.620]  You can buy it at Burberry locations with the Burberry band that kind of thing. Yeah, yeah
[2:53:12.020 --> 2:53:15.860]  That's I don't know. I think that's so crazy though that at the March 9th
[2:53:15.940 --> 2:53:20.220]  I'm not surprised at all that they didn't you know talk much about it back in September
[2:53:20.220 --> 2:53:28.380]  But I think it's crazy that at this event that they didn't talk about where what those select retail locations are because they're not gonna have another event before this happens
[2:53:28.380 --> 2:53:35.780]  Is this the first Apple product like not accessory, but major product line that you can't buy it every Apple store?
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:47.100]  Yes, I cuz I don't it I can't think of anything and I don't even have like a nagging sensation that I'm forgetting something
[2:53:47.340 --> 2:53:51.500]  Because they've had special edition iPods and stuff before but in general those were just available
[2:53:51.500 --> 2:53:56.420]  You know at whatever stores until they ran out. It wasn't like oh you can only buy it these places
[2:53:56.420 --> 2:54:02.540]  Right like you two iPod or whatever. Yeah, exactly like oh this store got three of them and then you know
[2:54:02.540 --> 2:54:06.420]  We ran out so we can't reorder, but it's not you are never even offered this
[2:54:07.260 --> 2:54:09.260]  Seems like interesting precedent to set
[2:54:09.700 --> 2:54:14.380]  Yeah, very weird. I thought it was it I had you know again the pricing in and of itself
[2:54:14.380 --> 2:54:20.900]  It doesn't bother me. It doesn't make me fear for the company and doesn't but the messaging around the edition is to me
[2:54:21.540 --> 2:54:23.540]  it
[2:54:23.540 --> 2:54:28.740]  Just suggest that there's a lot they don't know much internally. They don't know what to do with it either
[2:54:30.140 --> 2:54:32.740]  Yeah, or they're up two minds of what to do. Yeah
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:37.540]  I guess I want one thing and other people want another and they compromise is just don't talk about it a whole lot
[2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:44.060]  Which is probably not so great right? But it lends credence to the idea that this is Johnny I've you know
[2:54:45.020 --> 2:54:49.940]  Driven and not not something that's coming from the central core of the company. I don't know
[2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:53.660]  I'll be very interested to see you know how this plays out
[2:54:54.460 --> 2:54:57.060]  Yeah, all right. Let's wrap it up. I can't think of anything else
[2:54:57.620 --> 2:55:00.540]  Oh one thing I will mention sure just in a side
[2:55:00.540 --> 2:55:02.460]  We probably don't need to dissect it a whole lot
[2:55:02.460 --> 2:55:05.440]  But I think people are gonna be really surprised at how much they use the crown oh
[2:55:06.140 --> 2:55:09.580]  versus the screen yeah because the I mean there's a couple of reasons
[2:55:09.580 --> 2:55:12.580]  But the crown is matched to the scrolling rate of the screen extremely well
[2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:19.860]  So it feels like you know, it's natural how much it accelerates and when it stops the crown is they match that really well
[2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:23.380]  Which is what Apple does. I'm not too surprised. I'm not not shocked, but the
[2:55:23.780 --> 2:55:27.680]  There's also the fact that when your fingers on the screen you're covering some of the screen
[2:55:27.860 --> 2:55:31.660]  Yeah, so you're missing some of the data on a very small screen already, which is why I think the whole
[2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:36.500]  Crown thing, you know, executes well. So I think yeah, I think that's gonna be a big
[2:55:36.500 --> 2:55:39.180]  I think it's gonna be as I talked to a lot of people were like oh, I'm just gonna
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:42.180]  You know, I never thought that I'd use the crown I'm just gonna scroll on the screen
[2:55:42.180 --> 2:55:47.620]  But then they go oh, you know the screen actually the crown actually is really attractive for these reasons. Yeah
[2:55:47.620 --> 2:55:54.860]  I've heard the same thing from people who've been you know, Apple friends who've been testing it that it's totally totally legit
[2:55:55.620 --> 2:55:57.900]  It's you know, definitely a core part of it
[2:55:57.900 --> 2:56:01.140]  I've said this numerous times, but I keep getting questions
[2:56:01.140 --> 2:56:04.860]  So I might as well answer it again is that the what do you do if you're left-handed?
[2:56:04.860 --> 2:56:09.740]  You turn the what you take the straps off put the strap the bottom strap on the top and the top strap on the bottom and
[2:56:09.740 --> 2:56:15.620]  Then you put it on your other wrist and then your crown is beneath the communication button you just turn the watch upside down
[2:56:15.620 --> 2:56:17.300]  Mm-hmm
[2:56:17.300 --> 2:56:22.100]  I but it's like these it's like probably the most frequently asked question. I've gotten in the last three days
[2:56:22.340 --> 2:56:27.020]  Yeah, and because it's muscle memory in your left-handed you're always gonna be reaching for the same button in the same location
[2:56:27.020 --> 2:56:30.860]  So it's not like it's gonna throw you that's just how you use your watch. Yeah
[2:56:32.380 --> 2:56:37.980]  Yeah, did you I see asked some funny thing is they say that they tightened up the the feel of the crown
[2:56:37.980 --> 2:56:40.060]  I thought the crown felt great in September
[2:56:40.060 --> 2:56:42.140]  I can't even imagine if they've changed it out much better
[2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:46.140]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I had heard but in the crown that I used felt nice and tight
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:49.700]  But it's been so long since September that I can't really tell you know
[2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:54.860]  So unfortunately that's one of those things where we won't I don't know if we'll ever have empirical evidence, right?
[2:56:54.860 --> 2:56:58.660]  But yeah, I'm not surprised. It feels good. Yeah, no because it's been a long time
[2:56:58.660 --> 2:57:04.620]  And I'm sure that that you know it I do I think it's so central to their concept of how people will use it that the attention that
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:10.340]  They've poured into it is just incredible. Yeah, they fine-tune it right down to the last second before they commit
[2:57:10.340 --> 2:57:17.620]  Yeah, so Matthew Penzer, you know people who can read your work your fine work at TechCrunch where you
[2:57:18.700 --> 2:57:21.060]  Right way more frequently than I do
[2:57:22.540 --> 2:57:28.660]  But you do a great job and on Twitter you were your name is at panzer P-A-N-Z-E-R
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:34.140]  Yep, I got that. Yep. Anything else you want to pitch? No, not really. I mean
[2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:37.020]  No, all right
[2:57:37.020 --> 2:57:41.340]  I'm not a very pitchy kind of person. Thank you for your time recording this show
[2:57:41.340 --> 2:57:46.180]  Thank you even more for your attention during the event on Monday being my my go-to
[2:57:46.580 --> 2:57:49.900]  Let me text you questions my pleasure anytime
