[00:00.000 --> 00:03.140]  Tell me something about cooking.
[00:03.140 --> 00:05.800]  Tell me what you've got like an oven
[00:05.800 --> 00:09.980]  that my wife I think is gonna at some point kidnap you
[00:09.980 --> 00:10.980]  and have you come out here
[00:10.980 --> 00:13.720]  and install some kind of high capacity
[00:13.720 --> 00:15.480]  outdoor grill type thing.
[00:16.920 --> 00:18.480]  Yeah, you know, I kind of,
[00:18.480 --> 00:20.760]  I mean, I've always loved cooking to some degree
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.120]  and loved food, but only during the pandemic
[00:25.120 --> 00:27.360]  did I really have time to start to drill down
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.420]  and start working on a handful of things
[00:29.420 --> 00:33.600]  that I had always wanted to actually learn to do do,
[00:33.600 --> 00:36.160]  you know, not like wing it once in a while.
[00:36.160 --> 00:38.000]  And one of those was pizza.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.980]  And so I got one of these uni pizza ovens,
[00:41.980 --> 00:44.140]  which is the one I have as a gas,
[00:44.140 --> 00:46.420]  they make the combo wood gas ones too,
[00:46.420 --> 00:49.880]  but the one I have is a gas pizza oven.
[00:49.880 --> 00:52.360]  And it's, you know, it's great.
[00:52.360 --> 00:55.920]  It's actually extremely usable,
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.520]  has a really nice kind of wide opening.
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.320]  You can slide things in and out of,
[01:01.320 --> 01:02.720]  it takes a little bit of practice.
[01:02.720 --> 01:05.300]  You know, my first pizzas were burnt on one side,
[01:05.300 --> 01:07.660]  several of them calzoned themselves unintentionally,
[01:07.660 --> 01:10.100]  you know, you go through the whole learning process,
[01:10.100 --> 01:13.480]  but you really need like a continuous set of time
[01:13.480 --> 01:15.980]  to experiment with that stuff.
[01:15.980 --> 01:18.380]  Because pizza is very much like software.
[01:18.380 --> 01:20.380]  Like, you know, you go through 1.0 of your dough
[01:20.380 --> 01:21.980]  and then you go like, no, no, that's not right.
[01:21.980 --> 01:26.220]  And you're a few percent here, a few percent there,
[01:26.220 --> 01:30.120]  you know, another 1.2 of your dough.
[01:30.120 --> 01:33.100]  And you just, but you have to have contiguous time.
[01:33.100 --> 01:34.460]  And I was stuck in the house
[01:34.460 --> 01:35.900]  and like, I would get done with work
[01:35.900 --> 01:37.320]  and was like, hey, we're not going anywhere,
[01:37.320 --> 01:40.200]  doing anything, so I'm gonna fire up the oven
[01:40.200 --> 01:42.060]  and play a little bit, you know?
[01:42.060 --> 01:44.660]  And so I learned to do that better.
[01:44.660 --> 01:46.800]  And then along with that is bread, you know?
[01:46.800 --> 01:48.200]  So they kind of go side by side.
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.100]  In the same oven.
[01:49.100 --> 01:51.400]  You know, I do some flatbreads in the oven,
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.180]  but the uni gets to like 800, 900 degrees,
[01:55.180 --> 01:57.180]  which is not bread temperature.
[01:57.180 --> 02:00.220]  You need about 500 degrees for most breads.
[02:00.220 --> 02:02.140]  And you need that temperature on the uni
[02:02.140 --> 02:05.260]  because the stone needs to get ultra hot
[02:05.260 --> 02:06.860]  to bake the bottom of your crust
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.660]  so that you don't have a burnt top and raw dough.
[02:11.020 --> 02:14.100]  But with bread, you need roughly 500 degrees
[02:14.100 --> 02:17.000]  and an enclosed environment with a lot of steam
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.840]  to promote that spring.
[02:19.840 --> 02:22.440]  So that bit of the bread that you love,
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.340]  it's the fluffy inside with a lot of holes
[02:24.340 --> 02:26.040]  and aeration and all of that,
[02:26.040 --> 02:28.000]  that spring, that loft to your bread,
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.480]  that comes from steam.
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.420]  And most European ovens have steam built in.
[02:33.420 --> 02:34.440]  Or not most, I should say,
[02:34.440 --> 02:36.720]  but let's say it's much more common.
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.140]  And you'll have steam built in.
[02:38.140 --> 02:40.120]  So you'd be able to fire up your oven,
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.660]  say, hey oven, I'm making bread,
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.460]  could you put a little steam in here for me?
[02:43.460 --> 02:45.260]  And it keeps it nice and humid in there
[02:45.260 --> 02:47.020]  and you get a nice spring on your bread.
[02:47.020 --> 02:52.020]  But in America, most of our ovens do not have steam at all.
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.580]  So you have to create an artificial steam environment
[02:56.580 --> 02:58.440]  by enclosing either, you know,
[02:58.440 --> 03:02.100]  you pour boiling water in a skillet down below in your oven
[03:02.100 --> 03:03.460]  and you trap it in there,
[03:03.460 --> 03:06.060]  or you use a Dutch oven, which is, you know,
[03:06.060 --> 03:08.140]  a pot with a lid to try and trap steam,
[03:08.140 --> 03:11.600]  the steam coming naturally from the water in your bread,
[03:11.600 --> 03:13.060]  to cook it and to spring it.
[03:13.060 --> 03:15.460]  And so like, they're really two different operations,
[03:15.460 --> 03:18.060]  but all of the base preparations,
[03:18.060 --> 03:19.860]  all flour, yeast, and water.
[03:19.860 --> 03:24.280]  So you start learning a lot about how yeast and flour
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.200]  and water interact with one another,
[03:26.200 --> 03:27.780]  and salt to some degree,
[03:27.780 --> 03:30.140]  and getting an idea of how all that stuff works
[03:30.140 --> 03:31.300]  and they feed into one another.
[03:31.300 --> 03:33.780]  So if you start doing pizza,
[03:33.780 --> 03:36.780]  it's a very short hop to making bread and vice versa,
[03:36.780 --> 03:38.480]  you know, because pizza is bread.
[03:38.480 --> 03:40.760]  It just happens to have some garnishes.
[03:40.760 --> 03:42.240]  Hmm.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.820]  So, and this Ooni oven is something you can,
[03:45.820 --> 03:48.160]  you cook with it right on your kitchen countertop,
[03:48.160 --> 03:50.520]  or you have to cook this outside?
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.960]  No, Ooni's an outdoor oven.
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.580]  I mean, if you wanted to do an inside,
[03:54.580 --> 03:57.740]  I'd say you're probably risking death.
[03:57.740 --> 03:59.220]  I mean, it's a...
[03:59.220 --> 04:00.700]  That's well, it makes sense though.
[04:00.700 --> 04:02.100]  It's eight or 900 degrees.
[04:02.100 --> 04:02.940]  I mean, that makes sense.
[04:02.940 --> 04:03.980]  It is, and it's propane.
[04:03.980 --> 04:06.000]  So you don't, you know, you really don't want to do that.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.900]  Now they make a wood burning version of it,
[04:08.900 --> 04:11.140]  and one that does both as well.
[04:11.140 --> 04:12.220]  And there are other ones out there.
[04:12.220 --> 04:13.220]  There are other brands.
[04:13.220 --> 04:15.740]  The Rock Box is a very popular one
[04:15.740 --> 04:17.520]  made by a company called Gosney.
[04:17.520 --> 04:20.740]  And the Gosney Dome is a brand new one they have coming out
[04:20.740 --> 04:22.820]  or is already out, but already sold out.
[04:22.820 --> 04:24.340]  And so there are a handful of these.
[04:24.340 --> 04:27.500]  The entire sort of enthusiast,
[04:27.500 --> 04:29.700]  home enthusiast pizza oven market
[04:29.700 --> 04:32.100]  exploded during the pandemic, right?
[04:32.100 --> 04:33.400]  For a lot of the same, I mean, you know,
[04:33.400 --> 04:34.920]  I'm very basic in that regard.
[04:34.920 --> 04:36.480]  Like a lot of the same reasons.
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.700]  People are like, oh man, I want to make pizza at home.
[04:38.700 --> 04:40.340]  You know, I always wanted to.
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.000]  I always wanted to have those tasty pizzas.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.100]  How do I do that?
[04:43.100 --> 04:44.980]  And pretty much every oven sold out.
[04:44.980 --> 04:46.660]  And I'll tell you, like early in the pandemic,
[04:46.660 --> 04:50.540]  May to June, July, 2020,
[04:50.540 --> 04:52.660]  it was impossible to find even flour.
[04:52.660 --> 04:56.220]  Yeah, I know, it was crazy, the flour situation.
[04:56.220 --> 04:57.500]  I mean, it's,
[04:57.500 --> 05:00.220]  because I have a couple of other pals who were pizza makers
[05:00.220 --> 05:02.900]  and you know, it was such a big deal.
[05:02.900 --> 05:04.880]  Yeah, I had to buy 50 pound bags
[05:04.880 --> 05:06.700]  from restaurant supply stores.
[05:06.700 --> 05:08.260]  Even going into the grocery store
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.900]  and just looking at the flour aisle, like,
[05:09.900 --> 05:11.180]  hey, I heard flour is short.
[05:11.180 --> 05:12.660]  And you look and they're just have like,
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.020]  it's not just like empty shelves.
[05:14.020 --> 05:15.500]  They have like apologies taped up.
[05:15.500 --> 05:17.080]  They had like apologies taped up.
[05:17.080 --> 05:19.240]  No, we don't have any flour, sorry.
[05:19.240 --> 05:20.780]  Right, exactly.
[05:20.780 --> 05:23.780]  So, you know, that whole market exploded.
[05:23.780 --> 05:26.340]  Most of these ovens are not meant for in-home use.
[05:26.340 --> 05:27.400]  You got to put them outside.
[05:27.400 --> 05:28.420]  So they're like a barbecue.
[05:28.420 --> 05:30.980]  You know, I have mine next to my barbecue
[05:30.980 --> 05:33.940]  just on a little, you know, cheap Costco table.
[05:33.940 --> 05:35.140]  It works fine.
[05:35.140 --> 05:37.380]  And you fire it up with propane.
[05:37.380 --> 05:39.020]  It takes about 15 to 20 minutes,
[05:39.020 --> 05:41.380]  maybe 30 minutes to get up to temp.
[05:41.380 --> 05:43.420]  And then once you have it up to temp,
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.440]  you pull out your dough
[05:44.440 --> 05:46.460]  and your pizza's done in 90 seconds, right?
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.720]  It's a very, I call this like a,
[05:48.720 --> 05:51.180]  I call the process violent, right?
[05:51.180 --> 05:54.300]  Because you've got flame and you've got toppings
[05:54.300 --> 05:56.780]  and you've got dough and it's a dance, right?
[05:56.780 --> 06:00.220]  It's a sort of ballet that you're doing with violence.
[06:00.220 --> 06:01.620]  You know, the flame is in your face.
[06:01.620 --> 06:02.460]  It's hot.
[06:02.460 --> 06:03.660]  Your pizza's burning.
[06:03.660 --> 06:04.580]  You're trying to turn it.
[06:04.580 --> 06:06.000]  It's a little floppy.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.560]  You don't have the technique quite down.
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.780]  It actually is quite, you know,
[06:09.780 --> 06:11.500]  you look at, I'll tell you,
[06:11.500 --> 06:13.520]  there is nothing, I mean,
[06:13.520 --> 06:15.900]  on Instagram and YouTube and all this stuff,
[06:15.900 --> 06:18.900]  I'm sure at some point scrolling through Instagram,
[06:18.900 --> 06:22.020]  everybody has seen some sort of pizza-ola,
[06:22.020 --> 06:24.180]  a pizza guy in a pizza place
[06:24.180 --> 06:26.060]  throwing pizzas in and out of an oven, right?
[06:26.060 --> 06:27.260]  Like at some restaurant somewhere.
[06:27.260 --> 06:28.540]  You go to the explore page,
[06:28.540 --> 06:29.900]  at some point you're going to come across it.
[06:29.900 --> 06:31.300]  It's popular content, right?
[06:31.300 --> 06:32.560]  People love pizza.
[06:32.560 --> 06:35.080]  But there is nothing that will give you an appreciation
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.220]  for how amazing the muscle memory and skillset
[06:38.220 --> 06:41.500]  of these people that do it day in, day out for decades
[06:41.500 --> 06:43.580]  than trying to do it literally once yourself.
[06:43.580 --> 06:47.180]  Because the amount of frustration and anger
[06:47.180 --> 06:50.380]  and sort of like fear that it,
[06:50.380 --> 06:51.980]  you're like, oh my God, I spent so long.
[06:51.980 --> 06:52.900]  I got this dough ready.
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.380]  I had to start the dough yesterday.
[06:54.380 --> 06:55.820]  And how my toppings,
[06:55.820 --> 06:57.860]  I sauteed all these toppings in advance.
[06:57.860 --> 06:59.340]  And I made this sauce.
[06:59.340 --> 07:01.140]  And now I'm going to throw this pizza in the oven
[07:01.140 --> 07:03.780]  and it's going to turn into a wrinkled mess
[07:03.780 --> 07:06.260]  and melt all of the stone, you know?
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.160]  And like, it takes a while.
[07:08.160 --> 07:09.000]  I like it though.
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.140]  It's a challenge and it's fun.
[07:10.140 --> 07:11.260]  And the cool thing is,
[07:11.260 --> 07:14.660]  is that once you could be on the initial kind of wave of,
[07:14.660 --> 07:18.380]  hey, I can get a pizza off of a peel and into this oven
[07:18.380 --> 07:19.740]  and like sort of start to turn it
[07:19.740 --> 07:21.100]  to try and cook it evenly,
[07:21.100 --> 07:23.540]  most of your failures are edible,
[07:23.540 --> 07:25.620]  extremely edible and tasty, you know?
[07:25.620 --> 07:27.700]  So it's always a nice bonus.
[07:27.700 --> 07:29.420]  I wish I had developed a habit like that
[07:29.420 --> 07:32.280]  or a hobby like that, but I didn't.
[07:32.280 --> 07:33.120]  I got better.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.860]  I told you this, I got better at cooking steak,
[07:34.860 --> 07:35.700]  at grilling steak.
[07:35.700 --> 07:36.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:37.820 --> 07:39.100]  What was your process there?
[07:39.100 --> 07:44.100]  It's charcoal grill and just getting my seasoning down
[07:44.540 --> 07:48.660]  and getting really, really good at the temperatures
[07:48.660 --> 07:51.820]  that me and Amy and Jonas all like,
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.140]  which are all slightly different.
[07:53.140 --> 07:55.420]  Amy goes really, goes very rare.
[07:55.420 --> 07:57.100]  I'm a true medium rare
[07:57.100 --> 08:00.700]  and Jonas likes sort of a medium rare plus.
[08:00.700 --> 08:04.620]  Okay, like a slightly thicker rind,
[08:04.620 --> 08:06.460]  like eating into that pink in the center.
[08:06.460 --> 08:08.100]  Yeah, and the other thing that we were doing
[08:08.100 --> 08:12.280]  for the pandemic was we were buying our steaks
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.020]  from our favorite steakhouses,
[08:15.020 --> 08:16.360]  a couple of them here in Philly,
[08:16.360 --> 08:18.280]  just to help support them.
[08:18.280 --> 08:19.680]  At first, that was what we were thinking,
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.560]  like, let's just, they're selling steaks to cook at home.
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.740]  Right, like kits or whatever.
[08:25.740 --> 08:27.420]  But then we figured out
[08:27.420 --> 08:29.620]  that they were actually the best steaks we could buy.
[08:29.620 --> 08:32.380]  Like, the places where I thought
[08:32.380 --> 08:35.740]  I was buying good butcher steaks,
[08:35.740 --> 08:36.860]  I was like, you know what?
[08:36.860 --> 08:39.420]  The steakhouses actually are really great butchers,
[08:39.420 --> 08:41.060]  like, fantastic.
[08:41.060 --> 08:45.060]  And maybe, maybe because the two places
[08:45.060 --> 08:47.500]  we were buying them from were regulars at,
[08:47.500 --> 08:49.860]  maybe we were getting like choice cuts, I don't know.
[08:49.860 --> 08:52.160]  But Amy and Jonas both agreed,
[08:52.160 --> 08:55.800]  and they're not easy with compliments to me on anything.
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.080]  They both agreed that my steaks were comparable
[08:59.080 --> 09:00.480]  to the steakhouse.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.660]  And I was like, that's pretty good.
[09:03.500 --> 09:05.180]  Yeah, I mean, I would argue,
[09:05.180 --> 09:08.340]  obviously, all sensitivity to non-meat eaters.
[09:08.340 --> 09:10.980]  But I would say, if you can cook,
[09:10.980 --> 09:13.260]  if you can sear a good piece of meat
[09:13.260 --> 09:16.800]  and manage to cook a piece of chicken that's not dry at home,
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.580]  you've got 90% of what you would go to a restaurant for.
[09:20.580 --> 09:22.780]  And I mean, like, a really good steak,
[09:22.780 --> 09:24.340]  a really good piece of chicken.
[09:25.340 --> 09:27.980]  People spend years trying to get that right.
[09:27.980 --> 09:29.860]  And you go out to restaurants,
[09:29.860 --> 09:32.420]  and once you do cook a really good steak at home,
[09:32.420 --> 09:34.060]  as I'm sure you've found out,
[09:34.060 --> 09:37.660]  you start to really judge the steaks
[09:37.660 --> 09:38.920]  that you eat at restaurants.
[09:38.920 --> 09:40.200]  Well, you know what the other thing is?
[09:40.200 --> 09:41.660]  I don't remember if you know this.
[09:41.660 --> 09:44.620]  I know longtime listeners of the show will remember this.
[09:44.620 --> 09:49.620]  Ben Thompson finds it endlessly hilarious.
[09:49.840 --> 09:52.380]  It was like two years ago, maybe it was three years ago,
[09:52.380 --> 09:54.380]  I forget when, two or three years ago,
[09:54.380 --> 09:59.380]  Amy somehow misordered charcoal from Walmart.
[09:59.500 --> 10:02.100]  And we got, like, instead of-
[10:02.100 --> 10:03.580]  You got an enormous amount of it, right?
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.420]  Yeah, instead of, like, 36 pounds of charcoal,
[10:06.420 --> 10:09.760]  we got, like, 36 18-pound bags of charcoal.
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.760]  Like, truly, truly a, like, you know,
[10:15.940 --> 10:20.180]  like, if you were running a small-sized supermarket,
[10:20.180 --> 10:21.680]  it would be plenty of charcoal
[10:21.680 --> 10:24.520]  to carry you through the weekend selling to customers.
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.520]  But, and so I, you know, she made an Instagram post
[10:30.260 --> 10:32.580]  about it, and it was funny, and it's hilarious.
[10:32.580 --> 10:34.840]  And we have a big basement, and we just still have it.
[10:34.840 --> 10:35.860]  We're actually getting low.
[10:35.860 --> 10:38.220]  I think we're down to, like, eight bags.
[10:38.220 --> 10:39.060]  Nice.
[10:39.060 --> 10:41.460]  But here's the thing that's not funny about it,
[10:41.460 --> 10:44.800]  is that one of the things about having all that charcoal
[10:44.800 --> 10:47.700]  is I just got real generous about how much charcoal
[10:47.700 --> 10:49.380]  I'd put on the grill before lighting it,
[10:49.380 --> 10:51.920]  and I found out that I was definitely not using
[10:51.920 --> 10:53.420]  anywhere near enough charcoal before.
[10:53.420 --> 10:56.100]  You know, like, they, and you would think,
[10:56.100 --> 10:58.020]  you would think the bag of charcoal,
[10:58.020 --> 10:59.820]  and it's just, like, Kingston regular.
[10:59.820 --> 11:01.620]  It's not, like, any kind of, like, deluxe charcoal.
[11:01.620 --> 11:05.540]  It's just good old Kingston red, white, and blue charcoal.
[11:05.540 --> 11:09.100]  And you would think, you know, like, with toothpaste,
[11:09.100 --> 11:11.060]  the commercials for toothpaste make it seem like
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.940]  you should put about a half a tube of toothpaste
[11:12.940 --> 11:15.380]  on your toothbrush before you brush.
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.500]  Of course, right?
[11:16.500 --> 11:20.020]  They do, like, a curly QS, like, goes over,
[11:20.020 --> 11:22.660]  and then over the top again, and then back over,
[11:22.660 --> 11:24.620]  because, you know, use all the toothpaste at once.
[11:24.620 --> 11:25.460]  Photogenic.
[11:25.460 --> 11:27.660]  You would think the charcoal people would tell you
[11:27.660 --> 11:30.640]  to use a lot of charcoal, but they just tell you, like,
[11:30.640 --> 11:33.820]  enough to cover the grill, and then put it in a pile
[11:33.820 --> 11:35.220]  and light it.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.980]  I found that you want more than that.
[11:36.980 --> 11:40.060]  Not a lot more, but, like, one and a half times
[11:40.060 --> 11:44.460]  what I was using, and it gets the grill hotter,
[11:44.460 --> 11:48.620]  it keeps it hotter, and the difference between
[11:48.620 --> 11:52.340]  grilling a steak at, like, 400 degrees versus 500
[11:52.340 --> 11:55.380]  plus degrees makes all the difference in the world.
[11:55.380 --> 12:00.380]  Less time, better char, it all works out.
[12:00.940 --> 12:03.180]  Anyway, that was my cooking adventure,
[12:03.180 --> 12:05.860]  just getting better at grilling the one thing
[12:05.860 --> 12:08.860]  I was okay at grilling before.
[12:08.860 --> 12:10.700]  Yeah, I mean, look, there's a pleasure,
[12:10.700 --> 12:13.980]  there's a genuine pleasure in getting better at cooking
[12:13.980 --> 12:16.380]  that I love, and, you know, my adventure has gone
[12:16.380 --> 12:20.980]  beyond pizzas and bread and into a wide variety of dishes,
[12:20.980 --> 12:25.940]  sort of, worldwide dishes, dishes from outside of the US,
[12:25.940 --> 12:27.540]  that I'd always wanted to learn to cook
[12:27.540 --> 12:30.500]  because I loved eating them, but I felt intimidated
[12:30.500 --> 12:33.940]  by either the spice or my technique or whatever,
[12:33.940 --> 12:37.820]  and so I started delving deeper into Indian cooking,
[12:37.820 --> 12:40.900]  into, you know, a variety of Asian cuisines,
[12:40.900 --> 12:44.660]  whether it be Thai or, like, just one Chinese,
[12:44.660 --> 12:49.380]  or, you know, kind of other types of cooking
[12:49.380 --> 12:51.300]  that, for many people around the world, obviously,
[12:51.300 --> 12:54.180]  is just home cooking, but for me,
[12:54.180 --> 12:56.220]  and for many people in the US, requires, like,
[12:56.220 --> 12:58.660]  specialty spices that you may not have in your cabinet,
[12:58.660 --> 13:01.460]  and so you feel like every dish, for a while,
[13:01.460 --> 13:05.460]  you feel like every dish is such a cliff,
[13:05.460 --> 13:07.020]  it's such a hill to climb, because you're like,
[13:07.020 --> 13:08.220]  I don't have this, I don't have that,
[13:08.220 --> 13:09.460]  I don't have this, I don't have that.
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.820]  You know, you're going to the store endlessly
[13:11.820 --> 13:13.940]  for the first couple months, right?
[13:13.940 --> 13:15.540]  But then after a while, like, right now,
[13:15.540 --> 13:18.020]  I can walk into my kitchen and cook up a stir fry
[13:18.020 --> 13:20.700]  with, like, a nice, like, tingly, mouth-numbing sauce
[13:20.700 --> 13:23.220]  and all of the flavors that I love to eat out
[13:23.220 --> 13:25.340]  at, like, a nice Chinese restaurant,
[13:25.340 --> 13:26.860]  and I have all that stuff on hand,
[13:26.860 --> 13:29.940]  so, like, once you stock, and obviously, you know,
[13:29.940 --> 13:31.260]  people like different kinds of cooking,
[13:31.260 --> 13:32.580]  and so for different kinds of cooking,
[13:32.580 --> 13:34.020]  you'll have different kinds of spices,
[13:34.020 --> 13:35.900]  but the kinds of things that I'm interested in
[13:35.900 --> 13:38.420]  and that I love to eat, I can actually now go
[13:38.420 --> 13:41.860]  into the kitchen and not, I'm nobody's master chef,
[13:41.860 --> 13:44.580]  obviously, and I'm, my dishes are whatever they are,
[13:44.580 --> 13:46.060]  but I can confidently go, hey,
[13:46.060 --> 13:49.140]  I know what mix of spices belongs in this kind of dish,
[13:49.140 --> 13:51.220]  and I know that I have them on hand,
[13:51.220 --> 13:53.700]  and I know that the rough techniques, you know,
[13:53.700 --> 13:56.540]  like the chopping and filleting and, you know,
[13:56.540 --> 14:00.740]  other basic techniques that they drill into chefs at,
[14:00.740 --> 14:03.060]  at, you know, French culinary schools and kitchens
[14:03.060 --> 14:05.740]  and all that stuff, I'm nowhere near any of that, obviously,
[14:05.740 --> 14:07.960]  but you just sort of have to do the time.
[14:07.960 --> 14:10.580]  You have to chop 100 onions, you know,
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.680]  or a thousand onions before chopping onions feels like,
[14:14.680 --> 14:17.660]  oh, I got this, you know, I can dice it, I can chop it,
[14:17.660 --> 14:20.140]  I can rough chop it, I can slice it, you know,
[14:20.140 --> 14:21.540]  what do you need out of this onion, right?
[14:21.540 --> 14:22.500]  I can do this for you,
[14:22.500 --> 14:25.380]  and that part of it is extremely calming for me.
[14:25.380 --> 14:27.780]  Like, I find it relaxing and calming,
[14:27.780 --> 14:30.500]  and there's a joy in that at the end of it,
[14:30.500 --> 14:32.460]  I get to serve it to people, and like,
[14:32.460 --> 14:34.420]  that to me is like the big, awesome part.
[14:34.420 --> 14:37.660]  Like, you go out to your grill, you sear up that steak,
[14:37.660 --> 14:39.060]  and you come back in, and Jonas and Amy
[14:39.060 --> 14:41.580]  have a delicious steak, and like, you're the hero, man.
[14:41.580 --> 14:42.940]  You've got that steak done,
[14:42.940 --> 14:46.380]  you found joy in perfecting your technique,
[14:46.380 --> 14:48.860]  and they get nourishment and enjoyment out of it.
[14:48.860 --> 14:51.580]  That's why I think cooking is such a, like, a powerful,
[14:51.580 --> 14:52.940]  you know, more than a hobby,
[14:52.940 --> 14:57.100]  but a powerful sort of therapeutic thing to do at home.
[14:57.100 --> 14:58.300]  You know, I like it a lot.
[14:58.300 --> 14:59.420]  Yeah, the other thing we did,
[14:59.420 --> 15:01.340]  and I have to give credit to Amy for the idea,
[15:01.340 --> 15:02.240]  but it worked out great,
[15:02.240 --> 15:05.580]  was we learned to cook prime rib at home, which we-
[15:05.580 --> 15:06.620]  Oh, nice, that's hard.
[15:06.620 --> 15:10.380]  Now you, I know you and I both enjoyed the prime rib,
[15:10.380 --> 15:13.640]  or the house of prime rib in San Francisco,
[15:13.640 --> 15:16.480]  and Amy loves prime rib,
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.220]  and it's her favorite form of like a steak-type product,
[15:19.220 --> 15:21.580]  and we had just always, you know,
[15:21.580 --> 15:24.100]  we have a good prime rib place here in Philly,
[15:24.100 --> 15:26.420]  and we're regulars there, and so we,
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.800]  and we'd always just thought,
[15:27.800 --> 15:30.180]  and she's the chef of the family,
[15:30.180 --> 15:32.180]  but she'd always just heard that you need, like,
[15:32.180 --> 15:35.540]  a special oven to do it right, blah, blah, blah.
[15:35.540 --> 15:38.420]  Her grandmother on her dad's side
[15:38.420 --> 15:42.140]  was in a restaurant family growing up,
[15:42.140 --> 15:45.580]  and they had special prime rib ovens at the restaurant,
[15:45.580 --> 15:47.540]  and she just thought, well, there's no point,
[15:47.540 --> 15:49.920]  you know, if you have good taste in prime rib, you're not,
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.460]  but we were like, let's try it.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.500]  If you can't do it the right way.
[15:52.500 --> 15:54.580]  A, you know, we got the expensive stuff
[15:54.580 --> 15:56.100]  from Snake River Farms,
[15:56.100 --> 16:00.040]  which is very expensive for like meat shipped to your house
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.520]  in a pandemic, but like not really expensive
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.820]  compared to like going to a prime rib place,
[16:06.820 --> 16:09.280]  you know, like the house of prime rib.
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.700]  No, it came out great every time,
[16:10.700 --> 16:12.620]  and the secret, it's the same thing with grilling steaks.
[16:12.620 --> 16:16.180]  The whole secret is you need a thermometer in the meat,
[16:16.180 --> 16:17.720]  and you cannot eyeball it.
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.100]  Do not try to eyeball it.
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.900]  It's impossible, you have no idea.
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.620]  You just put the thermometer in, get an exact reading,
[16:23.620 --> 16:25.180]  cook it to the temperature you want,
[16:25.180 --> 16:27.240]  season it the hell up with salt and pepper
[16:27.240 --> 16:29.300]  before you put it in, start with a good piece of meat,
[16:29.300 --> 16:31.900]  and it's delicious, and the best thing about,
[16:31.900 --> 16:36.140]  we would do the prime rib on like holidays in the pandemic,
[16:36.140 --> 16:38.860]  so like Mother's Day or Easter or something like that.
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.620]  Leftovers forever, and just delicious,
[16:43.620 --> 16:45.820]  just like in feeling like, well,
[16:45.820 --> 16:47.420]  I don't know if this is good to eat prime rib
[16:47.420 --> 16:51.460]  five nights in a row, but it's really good leftover.
[16:51.460 --> 16:52.660]  Right.
[16:52.660 --> 16:53.740]  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
[16:53.740 --> 16:55.460]  I haven't actually tried prime rib.
[16:55.460 --> 16:57.540]  It's much easier than I was led to believe,
[16:57.540 --> 16:59.700]  and to me, the whole secret is,
[16:59.700 --> 17:01.260]  yeah, you just need a thermometer,
[17:01.260 --> 17:04.740]  and we've got some kind of oven that has a thing
[17:04.740 --> 17:07.100]  that you can plug, it's connected to the oven,
[17:07.100 --> 17:10.660]  so it looks like a speaker cable.
[17:10.660 --> 17:12.180]  You plug it into the oven inside
[17:12.180 --> 17:15.340]  with something that looks like a headphone jack,
[17:15.340 --> 17:19.500]  and then the other end is just a typical meat thermometer
[17:19.500 --> 17:21.300]  thing, you stick it in the prime rib,
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.720]  and you set it at whatever temperature they tell you to,
[17:23.720 --> 17:27.300]  which is pretty low, low and slow, but not crazy slow.
[17:27.300 --> 17:28.860]  It's not like you have to cook it all day,
[17:28.860 --> 17:31.340]  but it was a fun sort of holiday thing.
[17:31.340 --> 17:34.540]  Like, you know, early afternoon, I'd help her out.
[17:34.540 --> 17:36.380]  I'd be like her little sous chef,
[17:36.380 --> 17:37.940]  you know, helping her out, lifting stuff,
[17:37.940 --> 17:40.180]  and it was a nice way to spend the afternoon,
[17:40.180 --> 17:43.100]  and then like two hours later, delicious prime rib.
[17:43.100 --> 17:43.940]  Nice.
[17:43.940 --> 17:45.500]  All right, anyway, that leads me directly,
[17:45.500 --> 17:49.460]  what a great segue to my first sponsor, HelloFresh.
[17:49.460 --> 17:53.300]  Hey, we got you hungry for cooking at home, HelloFresh.
[17:53.300 --> 17:55.820]  I swear to God, I didn't really set this up.
[17:55.820 --> 17:58.020]  I actually, because it wasn't gonna be the first sponsor,
[17:58.020 --> 17:59.740]  but I just ran through the sponsors,
[17:59.740 --> 18:01.300]  and I was like, you know what, this is a good segue.
[18:01.300 --> 18:04.260]  Anyway, HelloFresh gets you fresh pre-measured ingredients

[18:28.060 --> 18:29.780]  they have meals to choose from.
[18:29.780 --> 18:32.100]  You can go through, you look at the ones
[18:32.100 --> 18:34.740]  that appeal to you, that you think or you know
[18:34.740 --> 18:36.540]  would appeal to your family.
[18:36.540 --> 18:40.220]  You order those, and then they show up in a nice box
[18:40.220 --> 18:42.980]  with some dry ice to keep everything fresh.
[18:42.980 --> 18:45.820]  Everything you need in the right portions
[18:45.820 --> 18:47.480]  so you don't have extra stuff,
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.520]  and a lot of them, they have some
[18:49.520 --> 18:51.480]  that are just 15 to 20-minute dinners
[18:51.480 --> 18:54.060]  that really are 15 to 20-minute dinners.
[18:54.060 --> 18:56.940]  It's not like, oh, you can make this in 15 minutes,
[18:56.940 --> 18:59.900]  and 45 minutes later, you still haven't started cooking it.
[18:59.900 --> 19:01.840]  Now, it's really, when they say 15 to 20,
[19:01.840 --> 19:03.560]  it's 15 to 20 minutes.
[19:03.560 --> 19:06.180]  They've even got stuff like Breakfast on the Go now,
[19:06.180 --> 19:09.500]  a lot more options than they did when they first started.
[19:09.500 --> 19:12.560]  They have over 50 menu and market items each week,
[19:12.560 --> 19:15.980]  including ready-to-eat salad, sandwiches, and soups, too.
[19:15.980 --> 19:17.360]  So there's something for everyone
[19:17.360 --> 19:20.140]  with recipes designed and tested by professional chefs,
[19:20.140 --> 19:23.180]  nutritional experts to ensure deliciousness
[19:23.180 --> 19:27.180]  and simplicity, great instructions.
[19:27.180 --> 19:30.020]  The recipes really do tell you everything to do.
[19:30.020 --> 19:31.900]  The produce is exquisite.
[19:31.900 --> 19:33.860]  It's exactly like the sort of produce,
[19:33.860 --> 19:35.620]  like if you went to the grocery store yourself
[19:35.620 --> 19:38.580]  and you were picking out the nicest-looking tomato
[19:38.580 --> 19:40.840]  or the nicest-looking green pepper.
[19:40.840 --> 19:43.520]  It's what shows up every time in the box.
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.980]  It's delivered from the farm to your front door
[19:45.980 --> 19:49.340]  in under a week, and it's contact-free.
[19:49.340 --> 19:51.940]  So if you're still concerned about COVID and stuff like that
[19:51.940 --> 19:54.440]  you don't have to worry, it all comes sealed up.
[19:54.440 --> 19:55.900]  It's really great.
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.100]  And they're saying, HelloFresh is saying
[19:58.100 --> 20:00.020]  that it can be up to 28% cheaper
[20:00.020 --> 20:02.020]  than shopping at your local grocery store,
[20:02.020 --> 20:04.780]  and it's 72% cheaper than a restaurant meal
[20:04.780 --> 20:06.820]  without sacrificing the quality.
[20:06.820 --> 20:09.820]  And their source for that is the Zagat Dining Survey.
[20:10.980 --> 20:14.580]  So where do you go?
[20:14.580 --> 20:18.840]  Go to hellofresh.com

[20:22.700 --> 20:27.220]  That's hellofresh.com slash talk show 14.
[20:27.220 --> 20:30.660]  And the promo code talk show 14.
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.060]  What's the deal with the 14?
[20:32.060 --> 20:36.660]  Gets you up to 14 free meals plus free shipping.
[20:36.660 --> 20:38.100]  That's amazing.

[20:48.420 --> 20:49.260]  My thanks to them.
[20:49.260 --> 20:51.540]  We use them here and they're great
[20:51.540 --> 20:54.140]  and we always feel very happy with them.
[20:56.500 --> 20:57.660]  Real topics.
[20:59.540 --> 21:00.620]  Let's start nice and easy.
[21:00.620 --> 21:05.620]  How about the Apple MagSafe battery pack finally shipped?
[21:06.020 --> 21:07.860]  Yeah, that shipped.
[21:07.860 --> 21:11.540]  I have been obsessed with iPhone battery packs
[21:11.540 --> 21:14.260]  for I guess ever since they were invented.
[21:14.260 --> 21:17.700]  I own, I think if I went through my office
[21:17.700 --> 21:19.340]  and all the boxes in the basement
[21:19.340 --> 21:22.580]  that I've packed up from previous things,
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.500]  I'm afraid to guess how many battery packs
[21:26.500 --> 21:28.540]  I've bought over the years.
[21:28.540 --> 21:31.820]  Yet, I don't really live a lifestyle
[21:31.820 --> 21:33.820]  where I frequently need one.
[21:33.820 --> 21:35.660]  It is a hoarder mentality.
[21:35.660 --> 21:37.660]  It's like safety blankets.
[21:37.660 --> 21:40.140]  Well, and I guess also that I've never found one
[21:40.140 --> 21:42.860]  I truly love, like I've never found a perfect one.
[21:42.860 --> 21:46.660]  Years ago, Mophie had one that opened up
[21:46.660 --> 21:48.300]  a little bit like a book.
[21:48.300 --> 21:52.780]  It had like an aluminum case and inside was like,
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.900]  inside that cover you'd flip out
[21:55.900 --> 22:00.900]  was a built-in three or four inch lightning cable,
[22:01.100 --> 22:03.960]  which was probably my favorite of all time
[22:03.960 --> 22:06.700]  because then you didn't ever have to worry
[22:06.700 --> 22:09.860]  about having the cable to charge your phone
[22:09.860 --> 22:11.140]  from the battery pack.
[22:11.140 --> 22:13.340]  If you had the battery pack with you
[22:13.340 --> 22:16.960]  and the battery pack had some level of charge in it,
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.400]  you'd have built-in cable and you could plug it in
[22:20.400 --> 22:22.320]  and it was relatively small.
[22:22.320 --> 22:24.560]  My taste in battery chargers is ones
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.060]  that just give you enough,
[22:26.940 --> 22:31.020]  the worst case scenario for me is even like WWDC
[22:31.020 --> 22:33.800]  or something like that where I'm on my phone all day,
[22:34.740 --> 22:37.340]  I need a little bit at the end of the day.
[22:37.340 --> 22:40.940]  I don't need some kind of 10,000 milliamp hour
[22:40.940 --> 22:44.860]  mega battery pack for taking camping or something like that.
[22:46.500 --> 22:48.380]  But they're never satisfying.
[22:48.380 --> 22:51.500]  So now Apple's got their MagSafe battery pack
[22:51.500 --> 22:53.740]  that finally shipped.
[22:53.740 --> 22:57.500]  It's weird timing, right?
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.220]  Because it's like...
[22:59.220 --> 23:00.940]  You mean in the middle of the cycle?
[23:00.940 --> 23:01.780]  Well, or like the end of the cycle.
[23:01.780 --> 23:04.580]  Like after the iPhone 12 or end of the iPhone cycle?
[23:04.580 --> 23:05.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:05.660 --> 23:07.300]  I mean, you have to, I mean, look,
[23:07.300 --> 23:08.720]  if they're introducing L,
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.580]  that means they're making no significant changes
[23:10.580 --> 23:14.220]  to MagSafe obviously for the next model of iPhone.
[23:14.220 --> 23:17.360]  So you can infer that, that seems pretty straightforward.
[23:17.360 --> 23:20.220]  So my guess is because of the modularity of MagSafe
[23:21.220 --> 23:24.580]  and probably whatever supply chain...
[23:24.580 --> 23:26.860]  Look, you gotta assume that for an accessory
[23:26.860 --> 23:29.340]  for a new iPhone, they wanted to ship it day in and day.
[23:29.340 --> 23:30.180]  And so if they didn't,
[23:30.180 --> 23:31.860]  they ran into some sort of problem, right?
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.120]  If this was not an intentional,
[23:33.120 --> 23:35.860]  let's wait nine months and ship this.
[23:35.860 --> 23:39.820]  I think though that they've always had a weird relationship
[23:39.820 --> 23:41.580]  with the battery packs because...
[23:41.580 --> 23:43.060]  Or the battery cases, right?
[23:43.060 --> 23:44.200]  The Apple branded ones.
[23:44.200 --> 23:47.660]  Because they never shipped them day and date.
[23:47.660 --> 23:50.560]  There's never been one that shipped as a day one peripheral.
[23:50.560 --> 23:52.740]  Like the earliest they've ever shipped
[23:52.740 --> 23:55.420]  is like two months after the iPhone.
[23:55.420 --> 23:57.900]  And they never make a big deal out of it.
[23:57.900 --> 24:02.780]  And I think it's just the obvious optics of,
[24:02.780 --> 24:04.900]  oh, if Apple is selling you a battery case,
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.660]  that means even Apple thinks the iPhone
[24:06.660 --> 24:08.360]  doesn't have a big enough battery.
[24:08.360 --> 24:09.200]  Right?
[24:09.200 --> 24:11.320]  And they want to sort of avoid that.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.160]  Oh, I see.
[24:12.160 --> 24:14.240]  So they're just putting some air in there.
[24:14.240 --> 24:15.080]  Yeah.
[24:15.080 --> 24:15.920]  So that they don't have to go like,
[24:15.920 --> 24:17.240]  hey, here's your new iPhone.
[24:17.240 --> 24:19.200]  Oh, and here's the thing that makes it usable.
[24:19.200 --> 24:20.040]  You have to buy this too.
[24:20.040 --> 24:20.880]  Right.
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.360]  Because don't you think that...
[24:22.360 --> 24:23.480]  Although they already do that with chargers,
[24:23.480 --> 24:25.040]  but let's not talk about that.
[24:25.040 --> 24:27.960]  But yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.
[24:27.960 --> 24:30.440]  I think you're absolutely reasonable assumption there.
[24:30.440 --> 24:31.280]  I would buy into that.
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.920]  It was exactly the case with the infamous iPhone
[24:34.920 --> 24:39.920]  for bumper cases, right?
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.080]  Where the iPhone 4 comes out and six weeks after it ships,
[24:45.760 --> 24:48.800]  there's this scandal that if you hold the phone wrong,
[24:48.800 --> 24:52.560]  it doesn't make phone calls or loses its attenuation.
[24:52.560 --> 24:56.280]  And they had to hold an emergency press conference.
[24:56.280 --> 24:58.440]  And Steve Jobs had to fly back from vacation
[24:58.440 --> 24:59.740]  in Hawaii to do it.
[24:59.740 --> 25:04.420]  And it's still, it's the most unusual Apple event ever.
[25:04.420 --> 25:08.420]  I mean, at least in modern Apple history.
[25:08.420 --> 25:10.600]  And they were like, you know what?
[25:10.600 --> 25:13.280]  We'll just give everybody one of these bumper cases
[25:13.280 --> 25:14.120]  we're making.
[25:14.120 --> 25:16.560]  Because the bumper case solved the attenuation issue
[25:16.560 --> 25:17.680]  because it would keep your skin...
[25:17.680 --> 25:18.600]  No matter what you did then,
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.760]  you wouldn't connect the two parts of the antenna
[25:20.760 --> 25:22.440]  that would cause the problem.
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.440]  But then the result was,
[25:24.440 --> 25:27.180]  Apple says you need a case to use the iPhone 4,
[25:27.180 --> 25:29.480]  which wasn't what they were saying at all.
[25:29.480 --> 25:30.760]  Mm-hmm.
[25:30.760 --> 25:31.600]  Yeah.
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.180]  Mm-hmm.
[25:33.180 --> 25:35.560]  Yeah, interesting.
[25:35.560 --> 25:38.300]  I mean, there's definitely the allegory there, for sure.
[25:39.260 --> 25:41.180]  This one is pretty late though.
[25:41.180 --> 25:42.420]  Yeah, it is.
[25:42.420 --> 25:45.300]  Like, I think you're absolutely right
[25:45.300 --> 25:46.980]  if you're referring to it in the frame of reference
[25:46.980 --> 25:48.860]  of say three months out, right?
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.060]  Or two or three months out.
[25:50.060 --> 25:51.140]  Something happened here
[25:51.140 --> 25:53.140]  and maybe it's just supply chain, COVID,
[25:53.140 --> 25:54.100]  you know, all that stuff.
[25:54.100 --> 25:55.720]  I don't know.
[25:55.720 --> 26:00.720]  I do feel that this is probably the best that they've done,
[26:02.020 --> 26:05.380]  you know, the best job that they've done with this,
[26:05.380 --> 26:07.100]  with a battery pack for a while.
[26:07.100 --> 26:09.180]  I mean, I was never the kind of person
[26:09.180 --> 26:12.540]  who crapped on the original design
[26:12.540 --> 26:15.620]  that they came out with for their battery pack.
[26:15.620 --> 26:16.460]  The humpback design.
[26:16.460 --> 26:17.420]  The humpback, yeah.
[26:17.420 --> 26:19.620]  I actually thought, I was like, look,
[26:19.620 --> 26:23.540]  it's, in many ways, it's refreshingly honest.
[26:23.540 --> 26:25.620]  It's like, look, we're putting a battery on here.
[26:25.620 --> 26:28.380]  We're not gonna put empty air in here
[26:28.380 --> 26:31.940]  just so you don't know it's a battery or whatever, you know?
[26:31.940 --> 26:36.940]  And like, I, as someone who did from day one
[26:36.940 --> 26:38.480]  immediately need this, right?
[26:38.480 --> 26:40.380]  Cause I travel a ton for work, right?
[26:40.380 --> 26:43.340]  I mean, or did at one point
[26:43.340 --> 26:45.700]  and travel a lot for work around the world
[26:45.700 --> 26:48.140]  where I did not know where my next outlet would be,
[26:48.140 --> 26:49.980]  you know, oh, here's an outlet in the airport.
[26:49.980 --> 26:51.660]  Just kidding, it doesn't work, right?
[26:51.660 --> 26:53.900]  Here's an outlet on the airplane, psych, right?
[26:53.900 --> 26:57.740]  So I definitely would never travel without battery backups.
[26:57.740 --> 27:00.240]  And even though I would always keep a battery backup
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.800]  of some sort that could, say,
[27:02.800 --> 27:04.480]  at least partially charge a laptop
[27:04.480 --> 27:06.860]  or charge my phone several times over,
[27:06.860 --> 27:09.060]  for ease of use, running through an airport
[27:09.060 --> 27:10.900]  or walking around a city or whatever,
[27:10.900 --> 27:12.080]  I didn't want the dongle.
[27:12.080 --> 27:14.460]  So I loved the Mophie clip-on cases
[27:14.460 --> 27:16.980]  that were just essentially an iPhone case,
[27:16.980 --> 27:20.220]  clamshell style, and then you would clip them on
[27:20.220 --> 27:21.860]  and they would charge your phone
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.500]  and they had a little indicator in the back
[27:23.500 --> 27:25.540]  that showed you how much juice was left in your Mophie
[27:25.540 --> 27:26.380]  and all of that.
[27:26.380 --> 27:31.180]  But those Mophies were like 60% air or 45% air,
[27:31.180 --> 27:33.620]  something like that, because they just conformed
[27:33.620 --> 27:37.700]  to this idea that, hey, you want this smooth shell back
[27:37.700 --> 27:38.620]  and all of that stuff.
[27:38.620 --> 27:40.220]  So when the humpback thing came out,
[27:40.220 --> 27:41.840]  I was like, hey, look, they deleted the air,
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.060]  which I thought was very Apple and kind of funny,
[27:44.060 --> 27:45.140]  and I didn't mind it.
[27:45.140 --> 27:46.940]  Well, and I think a lot of people hate it, right?
[27:46.940 --> 27:49.120]  Which, fine, you know, it's a taste thing at that point.
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.020]  It's not really a functionality thing.
[27:51.020 --> 27:54.100]  But I think this design, this modular design,
[27:54.100 --> 27:55.440]  I have actually, so I obviously don't,
[27:55.440 --> 27:56.940]  I don't have the battery pack.
[27:56.940 --> 28:00.620]  Apple didn't send me like any advanced units or anything.
[28:00.620 --> 28:04.120]  But I do have the Anker version of this,
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.020]  and Anker has had one for a few months now,
[28:07.020 --> 28:09.060]  and it's this sort of modular,
[28:09.060 --> 28:12.340]  I don't believe that they're actually MagSafe certified,
[28:12.340 --> 28:15.840]  but it is a MagSafe, you know, magnet array
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.180]  in the back of it that clips it to the back of your iPhone
[28:19.180 --> 28:21.700]  or to the back of a case attached to the iPhone,
[28:21.700 --> 28:23.860]  which I find as the best option.
[28:23.860 --> 28:25.260]  And I love it.
[28:25.260 --> 28:27.500]  It's exactly as you said,
[28:27.500 --> 28:29.900]  this kind of thing where it gives you
[28:29.900 --> 28:32.940]  just enough to get to where you need to go.
[28:32.940 --> 28:35.120]  So it is not like, hey, I'm gonna charge my iPhone
[28:35.120 --> 28:36.780]  three times over with this thing, right?
[28:36.780 --> 28:41.140]  It barely charges an iPhone 12 once, barely, you know?
[28:41.140 --> 28:42.940]  And especially if you're using it
[28:42.940 --> 28:44.500]  or if it's hot or whatever,
[28:44.500 --> 28:46.240]  it's gonna struggle to keep up,
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.360]  but it's just enough to sort of get you over the hump,
[28:50.360 --> 28:53.100]  you know, that next half mile to where you need to go.
[28:53.100 --> 28:54.860]  And I think it's absolutely fantastic
[28:54.860 --> 28:58.120]  to have it in this modular design
[28:58.120 --> 29:00.400]  where you can easily pop it off and back on,
[29:00.400 --> 29:01.860]  depending on your use case,
[29:01.860 --> 29:04.460]  if you need to furiously text something out, you know,
[29:04.460 --> 29:06.540]  or put a big chunk of text in
[29:06.540 --> 29:08.000]  and you don't want the lump on the back,
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.460]  you can just take it off, right?
[29:09.460 --> 29:12.500]  And then type it out and then pop it back on, you know?
[29:12.500 --> 29:14.120]  And I think that's really, really great.
[29:14.120 --> 29:16.380]  And you have the option to use it on a cord,
[29:16.380 --> 29:18.420]  which charges it very quickly, you know,
[29:18.420 --> 29:19.780]  because it's over USB-C.
[29:19.780 --> 29:20.660]  So I actually like,
[29:20.660 --> 29:22.500]  I think it's a pretty nice little arrangement.
[29:22.500 --> 29:24.440]  Yeah, I just bought the Anker and I have,
[29:24.440 --> 29:26.260]  so I'm in the same situation as you.
[29:26.260 --> 29:27.380]  I have the Anker.
[29:27.380 --> 29:28.720]  I've ordered apples,
[29:28.720 --> 29:31.800]  but it's not coming until sometime later this week.
[29:31.800 --> 29:34.940]  I think I got like a shipping notification yesterday,
[29:34.940 --> 29:38.480]  but, or like overnight, you know, while I was sleeping.
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.480]  So, I completely agree.
[29:44.080 --> 29:47.040]  And the nice thing about it compared to the cases
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.380]  is that the big problem with the cases is,
[29:49.380 --> 29:52.260]  okay, I think they were like a hundred bucks too,
[29:52.260 --> 29:53.540]  maybe even more.
[29:53.540 --> 29:57.360]  I know Apple's battery pack is not as a hundred bucks.
[29:57.360 --> 29:59.860]  And the big problem with the cases is
[29:59.860 --> 30:02.480]  if you get a new iPhone, then it doesn't fit anymore.
[30:02.480 --> 30:04.320]  And you've got this case,
[30:04.320 --> 30:06.600]  you've got this hundred dollar battery pack case
[30:06.600 --> 30:07.760]  that doesn't fit.
[30:07.760 --> 30:11.400]  And whereas this, you know,
[30:11.400 --> 30:13.200]  I think it's pretty safe to assume
[30:13.200 --> 30:15.860]  that Apple isn't going to change MagSafe
[30:15.860 --> 30:17.280]  for a couple of years.
[30:17.280 --> 30:18.740]  And even if they do,
[30:18.740 --> 30:22.620]  maybe it would only be to make it a little bit faster
[30:22.620 --> 30:25.480]  if they can, and it would be backwards compatible,
[30:25.480 --> 30:26.560]  one would hope, you know,
[30:26.560 --> 30:28.800]  with the charger stands and stuff like that.
[30:28.800 --> 30:29.720]  And even if they do,
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.420]  even if they delete the magnets
[30:31.420 --> 30:33.380]  or really change them dramatically,
[30:33.380 --> 30:36.120]  you have the option to still use this as a plugin.
[30:36.120 --> 30:39.040]  Battery, you don't in other ones.
[30:39.040 --> 30:41.920]  Right, well, I don't think Apple's works that way either.
[30:41.920 --> 30:45.880]  So I kind of feel like the Anker one that's 50 bucks
[30:45.880 --> 30:48.680]  is thicker.
[30:48.680 --> 30:50.280]  I don't have them side by side
[30:50.280 --> 30:52.920]  and Apple conspicuously hasn't,
[30:52.920 --> 30:55.880]  doesn't have like tech spec dimensions of theirs,
[30:55.880 --> 30:58.780]  but you can tell from the picture how big it is.
[30:58.780 --> 30:59.620]  Right.
[30:59.620 --> 31:03.880]  It's sort of defined by the shape of the iPhone 12 mini,
[31:03.880 --> 31:08.880]  just like the wallet attachment.
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.720]  Can be bigger than the mini.
[31:09.720 --> 31:12.920]  Yeah, you know, like the little credit card wallet
[31:12.920 --> 31:14.120]  that they shipped last year.
[31:14.120 --> 31:17.680]  Right, it kind of floats on an iPhone 12 or 12 max.
[31:17.680 --> 31:21.400]  Right, but it's exactly the dimensions of a 12 mini.
[31:21.400 --> 31:26.360]  It is perfectly tailored to both the width
[31:26.360 --> 31:29.120]  and like the corner, even the corner radius.
[31:29.120 --> 31:34.120]  That's the thing that makes me feel like for 50 bucks,
[31:34.360 --> 31:36.680]  this Anker is probably the way to go
[31:36.680 --> 31:39.960]  because like you said, then all you need is a USB-C
[31:39.960 --> 31:44.120]  to lightning cable and you can charge your iPhone
[31:44.120 --> 31:47.280]  from it at double the speed, 10 watts,
[31:47.280 --> 31:50.840]  just like you would a non-magnetic battery pack.
[31:50.840 --> 31:53.960]  And I think you're exactly right that the Anker one
[31:53.960 --> 31:58.960]  is MagSafe compatible, but not MagSafe certified.
[31:59.520 --> 32:04.340]  And so therefore it works great with all the MagSafe iPhones
[32:04.340 --> 32:09.200]  and connects very securely to MagSafe iPhone cases.
[32:09.200 --> 32:11.800]  Like if your phone is in a regular case
[32:11.800 --> 32:13.720]  and then you want to plug this Anker thing in.
[32:13.720 --> 32:16.280]  It actually seems to stick better in my experience
[32:16.280 --> 32:18.240]  when I put one of these cases on.
[32:18.240 --> 32:19.060]  It's like there's more.
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.440]  Definitely sticks better on the case.
[32:20.440 --> 32:24.620]  I think the case magnet is closer to the surface of the case
[32:24.620 --> 32:26.080]  than the magnet in the back of the iPhone
[32:26.080 --> 32:27.080]  because of the glass back.
[32:27.080 --> 32:27.920]  Yeah, I think so.
[32:27.920 --> 32:29.520]  And so you end up with like more adherence
[32:29.520 --> 32:31.440]  and better registration.
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.320]  Yeah.
[32:32.320 --> 32:34.960]  But that, and I'm not normally a case person,
[32:34.960 --> 32:37.280]  but that's another thing that every year I end up
[32:37.280 --> 32:41.760]  spending $200 on various iPhone cases to try them out.
[32:41.760 --> 32:45.160]  Even though I don't really have an active YouTube channel,
[32:45.160 --> 32:48.620]  I don't review iPhone cases, but I buy them thinking,
[32:48.620 --> 32:50.760]  well, I should buy like two or three of these
[32:50.760 --> 32:52.840]  and find one I really like and then tell everybody
[32:52.840 --> 32:55.040]  which iPhone case I like the best
[32:55.040 --> 32:56.280]  and then I never get around to it.
[32:56.280 --> 32:57.480]  And all of a sudden it's September
[32:57.480 --> 32:58.840]  and there's new iPhones that are out
[32:58.840 --> 33:00.700]  and none of my cases fit anymore.
[33:01.960 --> 33:02.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:02.960 --> 33:06.800]  I mean, I buy like two a year,
[33:06.800 --> 33:10.320]  approximately one to two a year cases.
[33:10.320 --> 33:12.920]  And I usually buy them just because I like the grip
[33:12.920 --> 33:13.960]  a little bit better, right?
[33:13.960 --> 33:14.780]  Just a little bit of grip.
[33:14.780 --> 33:17.240]  I don't buy anything extravagant, just the regular iPhone,
[33:17.240 --> 33:20.800]  you know, the Apple rubber cases typically.
[33:20.800 --> 33:24.280]  And I buy them seasonally for the color, right?
[33:24.280 --> 33:26.280]  Like I'll buy a bright one for spring and summer
[33:26.280 --> 33:28.060]  and I'll buy kind of like a, you know,
[33:28.060 --> 33:29.360]  more folly one or whatever.
[33:29.360 --> 33:33.200]  And I like them too when I'm going on a vacation
[33:33.200 --> 33:34.480]  for two reasons.
[33:34.480 --> 33:35.400]  I like to use a case,
[33:35.400 --> 33:37.000]  even though I'm not normally a case person.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  One is the grip and I'm on vacation, I'm taking more photos.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.480]  And there's a reason why, you know, cameras often,
[33:44.480 --> 33:46.240]  you know, like professional cameras often have
[33:46.240 --> 33:50.040]  like, if not leathers, like some kind of rubber type thing
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.440]  on the part you're supposed to grip.
[33:51.440 --> 33:52.960]  Like you don't want your camera
[33:52.960 --> 33:55.240]  to slip out of your hand, right?
[33:55.240 --> 33:58.920]  So making it more grippy as a camera is useful.
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.000]  And then number two, I've picked up more scratches
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.900]  on my phones without a case,
[34:03.900 --> 34:07.840]  like when I'm away from home than when I'm home,
[34:07.840 --> 34:10.640]  even though 95% of the time
[34:10.640 --> 34:13.360]  in a normal non-pandemic year, I'm at home.
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.680]  And I think it's just like the, I'm out of my usual patterns
[34:17.680 --> 34:19.840]  and I'm putting my phone down on surfaces
[34:19.840 --> 34:21.560]  I don't usually put it down on.
[34:21.560 --> 34:23.440]  And you know what I mean?
[34:23.440 --> 34:25.840]  Like when I'm home, I do the exact same thing every day.
[34:25.840 --> 34:28.160]  And so I never put my phone face down on anything
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.680]  that might scratch the glass.
[34:29.680 --> 34:31.800]  And then I'm away from home, I'm out of my element
[34:31.800 --> 34:32.640]  and next thing you know,
[34:32.640 --> 34:35.320]  how'd I get this big scratch on my glass?
[34:35.320 --> 34:36.140]  What'd I do?
[34:36.140 --> 34:39.040]  Yeah, and you know what, I typically will,
[34:39.040 --> 34:42.560]  so I run without a case and have for years and years
[34:42.560 --> 34:45.360]  and years, almost 90% of the time I've run without a case.
[34:45.360 --> 34:48.960]  But I will say my behavior has changed a little bit
[34:48.960 --> 34:52.920]  over the years because I do value that being able
[34:52.920 --> 34:54.480]  to set it down on any surface thing,
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.800]  because without a case, I'm always subconsciously going,
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.360]  well, is this gonna scratch my phone?
[35:00.360 --> 35:01.180]  Yeah, right.
[35:01.180 --> 35:02.760]  When I set it down on something, is this gonna scratch?
[35:02.760 --> 35:05.620]  It's that little mental check that you do,
[35:05.620 --> 35:07.440]  just like a little loop process
[35:07.440 --> 35:09.880]  that your brain runs through, I'm setting this down.
[35:09.880 --> 35:12.440]  Is it a surface that's gonna scratch my phone or not
[35:12.440 --> 35:13.360]  or damage it?
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.320]  And if so, then don't do that, right?
[35:16.320 --> 35:17.800]  Put it in your pocket instead or whatever.
[35:17.800 --> 35:20.360]  And so it is nice to be able to just toss it around.
[35:20.360 --> 35:23.240]  It is good for kids in Disneyland and various other things,
[35:23.240 --> 35:25.400]  just other people touch my phone more, you know?
[35:25.400 --> 35:26.780]  Yeah.
[35:26.780 --> 35:31.640]  And then I have to say the addition of MagSafe,
[35:31.640 --> 35:34.820]  because the tackiness of the rubber back
[35:34.820 --> 35:37.800]  and the magnet strength of the cases
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.600]  actually makes MagSafe accessories work better,
[35:40.600 --> 35:43.760]  I have actually been wearing it more for that reason too.
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.840]  So it's not just, hey, protect the phone,
[35:46.840 --> 35:49.100]  it's also that actually makes MagSafe accessories
[35:49.100 --> 35:51.080]  work a bit better, in my opinion.
[35:51.960 --> 35:53.740]  I just bought this little,
[35:53.740 --> 35:58.120]  I had been wanting one for a while that worked for travel
[35:58.120 --> 36:00.800]  and for casual use, and I hadn't found one,
[36:00.800 --> 36:03.100]  which is an iPhone stand.
[36:03.100 --> 36:05.400]  And I had, which I think you have as well,
[36:05.400 --> 36:07.980]  a little plastic credit card style,
[36:07.980 --> 36:11.040]  and you sort of, it's sort of cut out and you twist it
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.880]  into a stand shape, but it's sort of cut and packed flat,
[36:14.880 --> 36:18.840]  almost like those little metal models
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.240]  that you get and pop out, almost like that.
[36:23.960 --> 36:26.400]  But I don't like it for writing reasons,
[36:26.400 --> 36:27.840]  most of which is that it's fragile.
[36:27.840 --> 36:29.400]  It's already cracked in a couple of places
[36:29.400 --> 36:32.000]  and still kind of barely works.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.080]  So I put out on Twitter, I asked people,
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.080]  hey, does anybody know a credit card-sized iPhone stand
[36:39.400 --> 36:41.640]  that's MagSafe compatible, right?
[36:41.640 --> 36:43.200]  That I could just put on the back of my phone,
[36:43.200 --> 36:45.040]  or if I'm not, I don't need it
[36:45.040 --> 36:46.040]  on the back of my phone permanently,
[36:46.040 --> 36:48.080]  I can just tuck it away in a pocket in my bag
[36:48.080 --> 36:50.840]  and not even know it's there until I sit on a plane
[36:50.840 --> 36:52.880]  or go somewhere and I wanna prop it up and watch a movie
[36:52.880 --> 36:56.560]  or prop it up and have the screen visible to me or whatever,
[36:56.560 --> 36:58.040]  or even take a picture, right?
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.120]  And somebody recommended the MOFT cases
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.280]  or MOFT stands to me, M-O-F-T.
[37:04.280 --> 37:06.360]  And I think Craig Hockenberry recommended it,
[37:06.360 --> 37:07.900]  a couple of other people recommended it on Twitter,
[37:07.900 --> 37:10.600]  and so I bought one and it's actually quite nice.
[37:10.600 --> 37:14.380]  It's a foldable, like origami-style case
[37:14.380 --> 37:18.340]  that is as flat as maybe two to three credit cards stacked
[37:18.340 --> 37:21.440]  when it's folded, and then when you pop it out,
[37:21.440 --> 37:23.680]  it does a little origami and it can stand
[37:23.680 --> 37:26.900]  either vertically or horizontally at one single angle,
[37:26.900 --> 37:31.000]  nothing special, no adjustability or anything like that.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.580]  But it does stand the phone up,
[37:32.580 --> 37:33.720]  which is all I really wanted,
[37:33.720 --> 37:35.400]  and I've been pretty happy with that.
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.800]  But I think this speaks to the modularity of MagSafe
[37:38.800 --> 37:41.600]  and what Apple is hoping to see long-term
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.480]  from the ecosystem, and I think that people
[37:44.480 --> 37:45.320]  are taking advantage of it
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.160]  and creating some pretty neat stuff so far.
[37:47.160 --> 37:50.520]  So I'm anxious to see how this develops over time
[37:50.520 --> 37:52.960]  as people go like, hey, there's real utility here.
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.800]  And I think the battery case is part of that story
[37:55.800 --> 37:57.480]  and people have been waiting for it.
[37:57.480 --> 37:58.720]  I got one of those, yeah,
[37:58.720 --> 38:00.240]  I had one of those credit card cases.
[38:00.240 --> 38:01.400]  I don't know how you even know that, though,
[38:01.400 --> 38:02.800]  because I know I got it while you and I
[38:02.800 --> 38:05.360]  have been apart for the pandemic, but I do have one.
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.320]  It was one of those stupid damn things
[38:07.320 --> 38:10.840]  I bought on Instagram, and mine cracked, too.
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.480]  And I never really used it, and I was never rough with it.
[38:14.480 --> 38:17.000]  I didn't put it in my butt pocket
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.960]  and sit all the time on it, and that's how it cracked.
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.800]  It just sort of cracked while I was playing with it.
[38:21.800 --> 38:23.320]  And I think the fundamental problem with that,
[38:23.320 --> 38:24.320]  I don't know the name brand,
[38:24.320 --> 38:26.160]  I don't want to throw anybody under the bus,
[38:26.160 --> 38:27.400]  so I'm glad I don't remember it,
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.320]  but the problem I figured out with it
[38:30.320 --> 38:32.800]  is they tried to make it way too adjustable.
[38:32.800 --> 38:35.480]  Like, it's like once you have it in position
[38:35.480 --> 38:37.840]  and it's folded and you put the iPhone in,
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.400]  then it's like you can rotate this part of it.
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.960]  And it's like, no, that's the part that broke,
[38:44.960 --> 38:46.440]  is playing with that, it's too much.
[38:46.440 --> 38:49.520]  It's like, just give me something I can fold to prop it up,
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.600]  and then I'll figure out how to get the angle right,
[38:51.600 --> 38:54.600]  like if I have to prop up the whole thing somehow, you know?
[38:54.600 --> 38:57.360]  Yeah, I mean, it should be one click, right?
[38:57.360 --> 38:58.840]  That kind of thing should be,
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.600]  you take it out of your wallet or wherever,
[39:01.600 --> 39:04.160]  and you twist it once, and then it stands the phone up.
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.000]  It should not, they did try to do too much.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.880]  They've got these little cutouts
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.080]  that allow you to adjust the angle to a person.
[39:11.080 --> 39:12.680]  They even have degree measurements on them.
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.080]  I'm like, is this a stand or a sextant?
[39:15.080 --> 39:16.800]  You know, like, what is this?
[39:16.800 --> 39:18.800]  That's the word I was looking for, sextant.
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.560]  I couldn't, I couldn't, which sounds dirty, but it's not.
[39:22.560 --> 39:25.480]  Yeah, and you don't need to measure the angles of the sun
[39:25.480 --> 39:27.960]  and your astrological sign with it.
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.800]  You just need to stand your iPhone up.
[39:29.800 --> 39:32.480]  This MOF one works for that, for me.
[39:32.480 --> 39:35.400]  If you're shooting a serious video with your iPhone
[39:35.400 --> 39:36.800]  such that you really need to know
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.800]  that it's exactly 30 degrees,
[39:38.800 --> 39:41.600]  you're not using a credit card stand, you know what I mean?
[39:41.600 --> 39:43.040]  Like, if you're using something
[39:43.040 --> 39:44.840]  that folds up to a credit card,
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.280]  you're not, you don't really care if it's 25 or 30 degrees.
[39:48.280 --> 39:49.960]  You're just framing it, you know,
[39:49.960 --> 39:53.720]  25 or 30 degrees, you know, you're just framing it by eye.
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.040]  It's over-engineered and under-delivers, right?
[39:56.040 --> 39:57.680]  Which is pretty standard
[39:57.680 --> 39:59.560]  for third-party accessories sometimes.
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.720]  It did occur to me though,
[40:00.720 --> 40:03.440]  because I just got this Anker one a couple of days ago
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.000]  in anticipation of maybe having it and the Apple one
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.480]  by the time I did the next show, but I don't have them both.
[40:09.480 --> 40:12.360]  But it occurred to me doing,
[40:12.360 --> 40:13.760]  and then I was doing some,
[40:13.760 --> 40:15.600]  taking some notes before we recorded
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.040]  with the specs of the batteries and the prices
[40:20.040 --> 40:22.800]  of comparing the Anker and the Apple and blah, blah, blah.
[40:22.800 --> 40:26.240]  And it just occurred to me of how many magnets now are,
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.040]  like when you're in the Apple gadget reviewing spectrum,
[40:31.040 --> 40:33.600]  how many of the, everything has a magnet now, right?
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.040]  Because the MacBooks have snapped shut
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.600]  with a magnet for years to close the lid.
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.720]  The iPads, you know, have the craziest magnet system
[40:44.720 --> 40:46.760]  all over the back of them now
[40:46.760 --> 40:50.000]  for connecting to the keyboards and various things.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.760]  Now the, the pencil is magnetic now.
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.320]  The, it's magnets all the way down.
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.840]  And it's so crazy because for decades,
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.520]  one of the cardinal rules of using a computer,
[41:03.520 --> 41:05.480]  like one of them was like,
[41:05.480 --> 41:07.600]  don't kick the power out of the wall.
[41:07.600 --> 41:10.440]  Don't lose power while it's writing to disk.
[41:10.440 --> 41:13.120]  And the other one is don't even get a magnet
[41:13.120 --> 41:15.720]  in the same room as your computer.
[41:15.720 --> 41:16.560]  Don't even-
[41:16.560 --> 41:18.440]  If you bring a magnet in this room, I will kill you.
[41:18.440 --> 41:19.440]  I will slaughter you.
[41:19.440 --> 41:21.040]  Do not bring a magnet near my computer.
[41:21.040 --> 41:24.160]  I don't care if you work in like a big open office space.
[41:24.160 --> 41:27.560]  It's like no magnets in here because you can, you know,
[41:27.560 --> 41:28.760]  this is, there.
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.320]  Our hard drive, think of the hard drives.
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.960]  Yeah, don't, it was like a 50 50 call,
[41:34.960 --> 41:36.600]  whether you'd want to get a magnet near it
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.200]  or spill water on your keyboard.
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.120]  It's like, I don't know if I spill water on my keyboard,
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.920]  I won't lose data, I could just get a new keyboard, right?
[41:43.920 --> 41:44.760]  Right.
[41:44.760 --> 41:47.640]  Whereas a magnet would wipe out your data
[41:47.640 --> 41:49.720]  and now we've got magnets all the way down.
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.360]  And I'm sitting here playing around
[41:51.360 --> 41:52.960]  with how strong the magnet is.
[41:52.960 --> 41:56.280]  And you know, like I'm holding this iPhone 12
[41:56.280 --> 41:57.120]  with the anchor case.
[41:57.120 --> 41:58.560]  Thank you, solid state memory.
[42:01.560 --> 42:04.480]  One other new gadget I wanted to get your thoughts on.
[42:04.480 --> 42:06.240]  I just, ordinarily,
[42:06.240 --> 42:08.080]  maybe not quite during fireball material,
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.080]  but this new Steam Box handheld gaming PC
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.120]  from what's Steam's parent company, Valve.
[42:17.120 --> 42:18.000]  Valve, yeah.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.240]  So for anybody who hasn't seen it,
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.640]  I think it was announced at the end of last week.
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.760]  It is effectively a gaming PC
[42:28.920 --> 42:32.680]  in the form of a Switch, a Nintendo Switch,
[42:32.680 --> 42:34.680]  but without, with, but you know,
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.240]  the big difference from the Switch form factor
[42:37.240 --> 42:40.480]  is that the paddles don't disconnect from the sides.
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.920]  They're permanent, the controllers.
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.280]  But you know, I think it's a fair description
[42:45.280 --> 42:48.480]  that in a form factor that Nintendo pioneered
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.920]  with the Switch, sort of a horizontal,
[42:53.600 --> 42:56.960]  you know, like a Knight Rider steering wheel
[42:57.920 --> 43:00.680]  type form factor,
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.680]  that you can also connect via a dock to a TV or a display
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.720]  and then play like you would on a normal TV
[43:09.720 --> 43:11.960]  or display or something like that,
[43:11.960 --> 43:15.240]  that you can both use as a console style gaming
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.240]  and handheld style gaming.
[43:17.240 --> 43:22.240]  But it plays regular PC games for Steam.
[43:22.680 --> 43:24.080]  400 bucks to start.
[43:24.080 --> 43:26.680]  The $400 config seems really weak,
[43:26.680 --> 43:28.000]  and I don't blame them,
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.400]  because I get the product marketing
[43:29.400 --> 43:30.880]  that you kind of want to hit the 400.
[43:30.880 --> 43:32.080]  Yeah, you've got to get the price point.
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.160]  Right, and then I've seen so many articles
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.960]  say, you know, Valve's new $400 handheld gaming,
[43:39.960 --> 43:41.720]  and I'm like, huh, successful.
[43:41.720 --> 43:44.040]  Even though nobody who knows what they're doing
[43:44.040 --> 43:44.880]  would ever buy it.
[43:44.880 --> 43:47.160]  Like, I think you need to spend like $550.
[43:47.160 --> 43:48.800]  I saw a lot of people buying the mid-level,
[43:48.800 --> 43:51.280]  which I think is totally reasonable.
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.240]  You know, and then of course,
[43:52.240 --> 43:54.840]  you have the people who just buy the Macs on everything,
[43:54.840 --> 43:56.040]  and that's why you offer the upgrade.
[43:56.040 --> 43:57.240]  It's the same reason Apple offers
[43:57.240 --> 43:59.360]  the high-tier iPhones, right?
[43:59.360 --> 44:00.840]  They're like, people are just gonna buy
[44:00.840 --> 44:01.960]  that biggest one, right?
[44:01.960 --> 44:03.600]  They're gonna see suckers like me and you come in
[44:03.600 --> 44:07.960]  and they're like, just make a bigger one too, just in case.
[44:07.960 --> 44:12.200]  Right, and we're like, sure, oh, it's good.
[44:12.200 --> 44:13.040]  Is there a bigger one?
[44:13.040 --> 44:14.400]  Oh, okay, I'll take that one.
[44:15.640 --> 44:18.760]  The, yeah, it's an interesting piece of hardware, right?
[44:18.760 --> 44:21.600]  So Valve's experiments with this,
[44:21.600 --> 44:23.200]  I mean, there's a lot of water under the bridge
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.400]  with Valve and Steam and trying to get into
[44:26.400 --> 44:29.680]  like the living room and the hand, you know?
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.680]  It's a, the Steam, many people will remember
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.800]  the Steam Box, which they launched in like 2013.
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.320]  And at that time, Gabe Newell said
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.920]  that Linux is the future of gaming, right?
[44:45.920 --> 44:48.760]  And everybody was like, ha ha, ha ha ha, right?
[44:48.760 --> 44:50.400]  And then the Steam Box didn't really go anywhere.
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.920]  You know, it made some, it was interesting,
[44:52.920 --> 44:55.240]  an interesting experiment.
[44:55.240 --> 44:59.200]  But the Steam Deck runs on Linux, right?
[44:59.200 --> 45:01.360]  So, and they definitely have something there
[45:01.360 --> 45:04.520]  because they can package custom drivers
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.200]  and custom operators and a custom layer, essentially,
[45:08.200 --> 45:11.760]  to interpret PC games for the Steam Deck.
[45:11.760 --> 45:14.920]  It just opens the door so much better than, say,
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.160]  going on Android with an emulation layer or going on,
[45:18.160 --> 45:19.320]  you know, I mean, just,
[45:19.320 --> 45:21.560]  it maximizes the performance of the device.
[45:21.560 --> 45:26.000]  It gives them the ability to write their own software layer
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.960]  for the hardware in-house.
[45:27.960 --> 45:30.640]  And I think that it was the right choice, I think.
[45:30.640 --> 45:32.320]  So in the end, they got their last laugh,
[45:32.320 --> 45:33.640]  because I do feel that this is actually
[45:33.640 --> 45:34.640]  a pretty compelling device.
[45:34.640 --> 45:37.840]  Now, whether it is good and, you know, lasts
[45:37.840 --> 45:38.960]  and whatever else, I don't know,
[45:38.960 --> 45:41.520]  but it is a pretty compelling device on the face of it.
[45:41.520 --> 45:43.720]  And I, honestly, I think the biggest complaint
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.420]  anybody has had with it so far is the controller placement,
[45:47.420 --> 45:50.560]  which seems a little, a little top heavy.
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.560]  You know, the actual D-pads, or not D-pads,
[45:55.560 --> 45:58.340]  the thumb sticks are too high.
[45:58.340 --> 46:01.300]  And the D-pad and buttons are actually quite high as well.
[46:01.300 --> 46:04.300]  And they have put these two touch-sensitive controllers
[46:04.300 --> 46:05.380]  down below those.
[46:05.380 --> 46:07.300]  And Valve's been obsessed with touch sensitivity
[46:07.300 --> 46:08.700]  for a long time, actually,
[46:08.700 --> 46:11.540]  with a lot of their controllers and things.
[46:11.540 --> 46:14.380]  So it remains to be seen how, you know, usable it is,
[46:14.380 --> 46:17.200]  especially over long gaming sessions.
[46:17.200 --> 46:20.340]  But overall, the package seems pretty compelling.
[46:20.340 --> 46:23.640]  I mean, up to 512 gigabytes of storage,
[46:23.640 --> 46:28.480]  they use NVMe, I believe, memory, which is incredibly fast.
[46:28.480 --> 46:30.340]  It's a Zen 2 CPU.
[46:30.340 --> 46:31.940]  It's got an AMD graphics chip
[46:31.940 --> 46:36.860]  with a good 16 gigabytes of memory in the graphics chip,
[46:36.860 --> 46:37.780]  which is great,
[46:37.780 --> 46:41.520]  because at that resolution, it should work just fine.
[46:42.380 --> 46:45.700]  And, you know, I think that people in this arena
[46:45.700 --> 46:47.100]  will buy this stuff.
[46:47.100 --> 46:49.780]  They do want to play their games, you know,
[46:49.780 --> 46:52.740]  in pretty much every venue, right?
[46:52.740 --> 46:53.700]  It's possible.
[46:53.700 --> 46:55.660]  And the interesting thing is about this,
[46:55.660 --> 47:00.400]  this dovetails with a movement going on in gaming overall
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.420]  that even what you would call like triple-A titles
[47:04.420 --> 47:06.680]  or high-tier titles in gaming,
[47:06.680 --> 47:08.180]  and I'm sure you've seen this with Jonas,
[47:08.180 --> 47:11.620]  are much more about socialization and, you know,
[47:11.620 --> 47:14.100]  being with friends and existing in the same world
[47:14.100 --> 47:15.420]  with friends virtually
[47:15.420 --> 47:18.280]  than they are any sort of like hardcore,
[47:18.280 --> 47:21.100]  you know, gaming apparatus.
[47:21.100 --> 47:23.660]  And so, yes, there's the pro COD players
[47:23.660 --> 47:25.240]  and the streamers and all of that stuff.
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.520]  But in many ways, those are the broadcasters, right?
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.980]  And many more people watch those broadcasters
[47:30.980 --> 47:33.020]  than play those games at that level.
[47:33.020 --> 47:35.340]  And many more people play those games
[47:35.340 --> 47:37.580]  to hang out with their friends and do, you know,
[47:37.580 --> 47:41.860]  funny stuff and just mess around with the gaming environment
[47:41.860 --> 47:44.060]  and just exist together.
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.000]  And so if you have a portable device,
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.540]  I actually think it dovetails nicely
[47:47.540 --> 47:49.620]  with this overall feeling
[47:49.620 --> 47:51.240]  because they can be with their friends
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.540]  wherever they are virtually.
[47:52.540 --> 47:55.720]  They're not tied to a desktop or to a console.
[47:55.720 --> 47:57.460]  And I think that's very interesting.
[47:57.460 --> 48:00.040]  And it's way, it's gonna be way more compatible
[48:00.040 --> 48:01.500]  than trying to do it on your phone,
[48:01.500 --> 48:04.140]  whatever kind of phone you have, right?
[48:04.140 --> 48:04.980]  Yeah.
[48:04.980 --> 48:06.340]  Yeah, that was Jonas's take on this.
[48:06.340 --> 48:09.380]  I think that like the, it's the,
[48:09.380 --> 48:11.680]  and again, I don't wanna judge the controller placement
[48:11.680 --> 48:14.340]  without ever having even seen the damn thing in real life,
[48:14.340 --> 48:16.500]  but just eyeballing it,
[48:16.500 --> 48:19.740]  both the, like you said, the thumbsticks seem really high,
[48:19.740 --> 48:23.180]  the A, B, X, Y buttons, you know, the action buttons,
[48:23.180 --> 48:25.060]  you know, which is sort of universal now
[48:25.060 --> 48:28.600]  on game controllers, are way up in the upper right corner.
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.060]  It just seems like an odd placement.
[48:30.060 --> 48:33.120]  And it, you just, Jonas's first thought was,
[48:33.120 --> 48:35.460]  it seems like they moved everything way up high
[48:35.460 --> 48:37.860]  just to make room for these touch pads
[48:37.860 --> 48:40.580]  that who knows what you're supposed to use them for?
[48:41.540 --> 48:44.320]  Like, it doesn't seem like this is an ergonomic placement
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.320]  of thumbsticks and action buttons.
[48:46.320 --> 48:49.220]  It seems like this is the best option we have
[48:49.220 --> 48:52.940]  if we're going to put these track pads on both sides.
[48:52.940 --> 48:53.780]  Correct.
[48:53.780 --> 48:55.460]  It seems like a concession to the track pad,
[48:55.460 --> 48:57.820]  not some sort of usability decision
[48:57.820 --> 49:01.780]  that was driven by user comfort first, right?
[49:01.780 --> 49:04.380]  And we could be wrong, as you said, right?
[49:04.380 --> 49:05.940]  Like you're judging it without having any hand.
[49:05.940 --> 49:07.020]  We could be wrong.
[49:07.020 --> 49:09.680]  Maybe the touch pads have an immense amount more utility
[49:09.680 --> 49:10.520]  than we think.
[49:10.520 --> 49:13.940]  Maybe they're just as good as a thumbstick.
[49:13.940 --> 49:16.500]  They're not, but maybe they are, maybe they are.
[49:16.500 --> 49:17.500]  And we'll see, right?
[49:17.500 --> 49:19.660]  And that's the part of it where you're like,
[49:19.660 --> 49:21.580]  okay, you know, we'll see.
[49:21.580 --> 49:23.460]  We'll judge it once we have it in hand.
[49:23.460 --> 49:26.500]  But absolutely, it does send the message.
[49:26.500 --> 49:28.740]  We think these touch pads are much more important
[49:28.740 --> 49:30.580]  than your thumbsticks, so enjoy.
[49:30.580 --> 49:33.140]  Now, I will say this, you can't put those thumbsticks
[49:33.140 --> 49:35.260]  above, or excuse me, those touch pads
[49:35.260 --> 49:36.500]  above the thumbsticks, right?
[49:36.500 --> 49:39.700]  That's not gonna work, period, from a usability perspective.
[49:39.700 --> 49:41.500]  So there's some part of it that's like,
[49:41.500 --> 49:45.260]  they kinda have to be where they are, but.
[49:45.260 --> 49:47.100]  Unless you just didn't have them.
[49:47.100 --> 49:48.860]  Unless you, correct, correct.
[49:48.860 --> 49:49.700]  There's a choice.
[49:49.700 --> 49:51.900]  There's a definite choice being made here,
[49:51.900 --> 49:56.340]  and it's just a matter of time and usability and testing
[49:56.340 --> 49:57.860]  to see whether that choice was the right one.
[49:57.860 --> 49:58.820]  Yeah.
[49:58.820 --> 50:00.660]  I probably could have had Jonas on the show this week,
[50:00.660 --> 50:02.740]  because the other, the related topic is.
[50:02.740 --> 50:03.580]  Interested to hear what he had to say.
[50:03.580 --> 50:08.100]  Jonas has thought on the new Switch OLED.
[50:08.100 --> 50:10.080]  I think that's actually the name of the product.
[50:10.080 --> 50:10.920]  I don't know.
[50:10.920 --> 50:13.340]  It is, I think it literally is, yeah.
[50:13.340 --> 50:14.180]  Which is.
[50:14.180 --> 50:15.640]  Nintendo's brilliant about that kind of stuff.
[50:15.640 --> 50:17.220]  They're just like, I don't know, just call it this.
[50:17.220 --> 50:20.080]  They have a new version of the Switch coming out
[50:20.080 --> 50:23.900]  for the holiday season that has a much improved screen
[50:23.900 --> 50:27.220]  that is, of course, now, surprise, surprise, OLED.
[50:28.260 --> 50:30.760]  But all the other specs are the same,
[50:30.760 --> 50:33.100]  and he's baffled by that.
[50:33.100 --> 50:35.040]  And he's like, I don't understand why they would do that.
[50:35.040 --> 50:36.160]  And he loves his Switch.
[50:36.160 --> 50:38.760]  He's PC gamer first, but he loves his Switch.
[50:38.760 --> 50:40.900]  He really, and when we travel, he loves to take it,
[50:40.900 --> 50:43.040]  and he really enjoys the action.
[50:43.040 --> 50:45.740]  But he feels the Switch has always been
[50:45.740 --> 50:49.700]  just barely fast enough to run the games
[50:49.700 --> 50:51.700]  that Nintendo wants you to play on Switch.
[50:51.700 --> 50:53.940]  So why not give it a spec bump?
[50:53.940 --> 50:56.320]  And I tried to explain that from Nintendo's perspective,
[50:56.320 --> 50:59.880]  while they have a thriving platform
[50:59.880 --> 51:03.840]  that hasn't really gone into decline in popularity yet,
[51:03.840 --> 51:07.400]  the precise compatibility is a feature, not a bug.
[51:07.400 --> 51:09.500]  That you know that if the game says
[51:09.500 --> 51:11.900]  it's a Nintendo Switch game,
[51:11.900 --> 51:14.420]  you might have the low-cost Switch,
[51:14.420 --> 51:15.900]  you might have the classic Switch,
[51:15.900 --> 51:17.260]  you might have the Switch OLED,
[51:17.260 --> 51:19.300]  but you're gonna get the exact same performance,
[51:19.300 --> 51:22.300]  and there's no game that's gonna run better
[51:22.300 --> 51:24.620]  just because you bought the latest and greatest one
[51:24.620 --> 51:27.740]  from 2021, and that's a feature, not a bug.
[51:27.740 --> 51:30.020]  But he just doesn't get it, whereas-
[51:30.020 --> 51:31.860]  It's also a feature of the App Store, right?
[51:31.860 --> 51:34.300]  Like, you know, the iPhone, sure,
[51:34.300 --> 51:35.980]  the more powerful iPhone is gonna do things,
[51:35.980 --> 51:38.540]  but if you're using the native frameworks,
[51:38.540 --> 51:39.960]  you're gonna get roughly the same performance
[51:39.960 --> 51:40.800]  out of any iPhone,
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.160]  because it's gonna scale it automatically.
[51:42.160 --> 51:43.000]  Right.
[51:44.940 --> 51:46.820]  But it's, you know, it is still good.
[51:46.820 --> 51:49.980]  And then my other thought on that is it warms my heart,
[51:49.980 --> 51:52.040]  and as somebody who was very pessimistic
[51:52.040 --> 51:56.180]  about Nintendo's prospects five, six, seven years ago,
[51:56.180 --> 51:58.100]  a couple of years before the Switch came out,
[51:58.100 --> 52:01.360]  it warms my heart that they have another hit platform
[52:01.360 --> 52:06.300]  that even my 17-year-old gaming PC-obsessed son
[52:06.300 --> 52:10.260]  cares enough about to drag me up
[52:10.260 --> 52:12.180]  and chew my ear off about.
[52:12.180 --> 52:14.060]  Right, that's great, I love it.
[52:14.060 --> 52:15.180]  Yeah, it's fantastic.
[52:15.180 --> 52:17.380]  And, you know, it's, yeah,
[52:18.700 --> 52:22.700]  you only care enough about, I mean, like, he cares, right?
[52:22.700 --> 52:24.380]  That's why he's like, wait, what?
[52:24.380 --> 52:26.000]  You know, like, and that's what you want.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.340]  You want people, enthusiasts going like, wait a minute,
[52:28.340 --> 52:29.440]  are you sure this is the right move?
[52:29.440 --> 52:31.700]  You know, you don't want people going, who cares, right?
[52:31.700 --> 52:32.860]  Like, that's the worst case scenario
[52:32.860 --> 52:34.180]  is people going, I don't care.
[52:34.180 --> 52:35.180]  Do whatever you want.
[52:35.180 --> 52:38.700]  But the Switch is very interesting too,
[52:38.700 --> 52:41.940]  because I really do believe that this is like,
[52:41.940 --> 52:45.220]  if Nintendo is smart, and they have been dumb
[52:45.220 --> 52:48.300]  and have been smart, alternatively, throughout the years,
[52:48.300 --> 52:50.620]  you know, very smart in many things like game design,
[52:50.620 --> 52:52.780]  obviously, very dumb in things like online play
[52:52.780 --> 52:57.220]  and other areas, but they, if they are smart,
[52:57.220 --> 53:01.740]  the Switch is sort of the future of all Nintendo consoles.
[53:01.740 --> 53:04.860]  Right, like, this is not a, hey, we had the Switch
[53:04.860 --> 53:08.700]  and now we're gonna have the, the Hoomerang, right?
[53:08.700 --> 53:11.500]  Enjoy your new Nintendo Hoomerang
[53:11.500 --> 53:12.980]  with these new things, right?
[53:12.980 --> 53:14.700]  And I know that they love to play
[53:14.700 --> 53:17.220]  and they love to create new ways to play,
[53:17.220 --> 53:20.740]  but I do feel that the Switch is so potent,
[53:20.740 --> 53:23.180]  like it's so good in its form factor,
[53:23.180 --> 53:25.460]  they nailed it so hardcore,
[53:25.460 --> 53:28.740]  that they really need to focus on creating more Switches.
[53:28.740 --> 53:31.900]  You know, not, not new paradigms.
[53:31.900 --> 53:35.420]  Like, this Switch could be the Nintendo console
[53:35.420 --> 53:37.460]  in perpetuity, and yes,
[53:37.460 --> 53:39.460]  they will increase hardware capability
[53:39.460 --> 53:43.260]  or add accessories or change the performance levels
[53:43.260 --> 53:46.460]  or, you know, even tweak the form factor to some degree,
[53:46.460 --> 53:49.020]  but this idea, this concept that they had,
[53:49.020 --> 53:51.500]  the removable controllers, the portability,
[53:51.500 --> 53:53.740]  the fact that the console is in your hands
[53:53.740 --> 53:55.700]  and, you know, on your dock,
[53:55.700 --> 53:58.900]  and there is no two separate consoles and all that stuff,
[53:58.900 --> 54:00.780]  all of that, just, they just nailed it.
[54:00.780 --> 54:02.940]  And they need to double down on that.
[54:02.940 --> 54:05.100]  Right, just a nice, unobjectionable dock
[54:05.100 --> 54:06.860]  that you can keep plugged into your TV
[54:06.860 --> 54:09.620]  and all you need to, and it'll both charge your Switch
[54:09.620 --> 54:12.100]  and let you play on your TV.
[54:12.100 --> 54:14.260]  It is, it's a hit.
[54:14.260 --> 54:16.300]  But anyway, I thought it was fascinating that Steam,
[54:16.300 --> 54:17.660]  you know, sort of took the idea
[54:17.660 --> 54:19.540]  and ran with it in the PC direction.
[54:19.540 --> 54:20.700]  All right, let me take a break here.
[54:20.700 --> 54:21.860]  Thank my next sponsor.
[54:21.860 --> 54:24.180]  It is our good friends at Memberful.
[54:24.180 --> 54:27.180]  Memberful is the easiest way to sell memberships
[54:27.180 --> 54:29.140]  to your audience, and it is used
[54:29.140 --> 54:33.180]  by some of the biggest creators on the web and the internet.
[54:34.340 --> 54:36.660]  Maybe you have an existing membership setup
[54:36.660 --> 54:38.340]  and it's too complicated to manage
[54:38.340 --> 54:40.500]  and you just want to simplify it,
[54:40.500 --> 54:42.460]  you can switch to Memberful.
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.780]  They handle the hard stuff
[54:45.900 --> 54:50.420]  and it ensures your ownership of the stuff.
[54:50.420 --> 54:53.940]  Memberful's brand fades into the background.
[54:53.940 --> 54:57.060]  Your brand for your site or your channel
[54:57.060 --> 55:00.220]  or whatever it is that you're looking to monetize
[55:00.220 --> 55:02.860]  is front and center, and Memberful is just sort of
[55:02.860 --> 55:07.860]  an invisible backend that handles all this stuff for you.
[55:07.860 --> 55:11.540]  And you maintain full control and ownership
[55:11.540 --> 55:14.860]  of your audience, your brand, and your memberships.
[55:14.860 --> 55:19.180]  Payments go directly to your Stripe account.
[55:19.180 --> 55:22.540]  So there's no like net 30s type situation
[55:22.540 --> 55:23.780]  or something like that.
[55:23.780 --> 55:25.860]  You integrate with your own Stripe account
[55:25.860 --> 55:28.460]  and the payments go directly to you.
[55:28.460 --> 55:31.620]  And it seamlessly integrates with the tools you already use
[55:31.620 --> 55:36.620]  like WordPress and MailChimp, Discord, and lots more.
[55:37.020 --> 55:39.740]  And it lets you create members only podcasts even
[55:39.740 --> 55:42.100]  using your existing podcast hosting
[55:42.100 --> 55:44.220]  so you can start earning more revenue
[55:44.220 --> 55:47.820]  and make some money with your current publishing workflow.
[55:47.820 --> 55:51.620]  You can get started for free, no credit card required.
[55:51.620 --> 55:54.260]  Just go to memberful.com slash talk show.
[55:54.260 --> 55:56.860]  That's memberful.com slash talk show.
[55:56.860 --> 56:01.740]  And you can monetize your site, your channel,
[56:01.740 --> 56:05.980]  and maintain complete control over your brand
[56:05.980 --> 56:09.180]  and your subscriber list.
[56:09.180 --> 56:10.580]  It's really a great service.
[56:10.580 --> 56:14.540]  I know a bunch of my friends who use it and they love it.
[56:16.340 --> 56:21.020]  Next on my list of breaking news is this sort of slow
[56:21.020 --> 56:24.500]  drip by drip leak from a bunch of publications
[56:24.500 --> 56:27.420]  about this investigation into the NSO group
[56:27.420 --> 56:32.420]  and their Pegasus software, which I know it's a summary.
[56:32.860 --> 56:37.860]  So the NSO group is a crackerjack team of top,
[56:39.140 --> 56:44.140]  maybe the top iPhone hackers or phone hackers
[56:44.500 --> 56:46.780]  because probably they had computers too,
[56:46.780 --> 56:48.820]  but obviously phones are the big target these days.
[56:48.820 --> 56:51.980]  Computer hackers, they're from Israel.
[56:51.980 --> 56:53.340]  They're an Israeli company.
[56:54.340 --> 56:57.740]  They claim that they only sell their product and service.
[56:57.740 --> 56:59.340]  They're not like an underground team.
[56:59.340 --> 57:00.500]  They're on the up and up.
[57:00.500 --> 57:02.380]  They're a commercial organization,
[57:02.380 --> 57:04.620]  a company that makes charges a lot of money,
[57:04.620 --> 57:08.500]  but they supposedly only sell their services
[57:08.500 --> 57:13.500]  to legitimate law enforcement agencies
[57:13.500 --> 57:18.500]  in countries that supposedly can be trusted
[57:18.860 --> 57:22.100]  around the world and that their terms
[57:22.100 --> 57:25.180]  that they claim they require law enforcement agencies
[57:25.180 --> 57:27.940]  to use is that their software will only be used
[57:27.940 --> 57:30.060]  to target criminals and terrorists
[57:30.060 --> 57:34.360]  and I guess bad guys, to use a phrase.
[57:36.620 --> 57:41.620]  And they're at the forefront of the cat and mouse game
[57:41.620 --> 57:46.620]  with Apple in terms of NSO group seeks and finds
[57:47.700 --> 57:52.700]  and uses exploits in iOS to take control of iPhones
[57:53.580 --> 57:58.580]  and Apple seeks to close exploits and vulnerabilities
[58:00.020 --> 58:03.460]  and entire classes of vulnerabilities
[58:03.460 --> 58:05.620]  to keep this from happening.
[58:05.620 --> 58:10.620]  And this investigation, somehow a list of I think hundreds
[58:10.620 --> 58:15.140]  hundreds, maybe a thousand phone numbers leaked
[58:15.140 --> 58:17.580]  that had been attacked by the NSO group
[58:17.580 --> 58:20.700]  and Amnesty International, which is an unusual group
[58:20.700 --> 58:23.580]  to be sort of spearheading and funding the investigation
[58:24.980 --> 58:26.340]  or at least seems to be,
[58:26.340 --> 58:27.900]  cause you don't think of Amnesty International
[58:27.900 --> 58:31.500]  as being at the forefront of computer security journalism,
[58:32.420 --> 58:33.260]  but if you think.
[58:33.260 --> 58:34.620]  Yeah, and there was 50,000 phone numbers.
[58:34.620 --> 58:36.340]  50,000 phone numbers, okay.
[58:36.340 --> 58:37.780]  So, but that's it.
[58:37.780 --> 58:39.580]  And it was too many for the investigators
[58:39.580 --> 58:43.620]  to really thoroughly, they had to like pick swaths.
[58:43.620 --> 58:44.780]  Yeah, pick stuff.
[58:44.780 --> 58:48.300]  But if you think of Amnesty International's overall goal
[58:48.300 --> 58:53.300]  of supporting human rights protesters and organizers
[58:55.060 --> 58:58.460]  around the world who often because of the nature
[58:58.460 --> 59:02.700]  of what they're hoping to bring about change
[59:02.700 --> 59:07.700]  are in danger themselves of being targeted by countries.
[59:07.700 --> 59:09.940]  Yeah, you really can't concentrate on human rights
[59:09.940 --> 59:11.140]  without talking about digital rights
[59:11.140 --> 59:12.940]  and concentrating on that as well.
[59:12.940 --> 59:15.540]  It's just a part and parcel of being a human these days.
[59:15.540 --> 59:16.380]  Yeah. Right.
[59:16.380 --> 59:21.380]  And this investigation showed that some of it's surprising
[59:22.500 --> 59:25.060]  or I guess none of it to me was shocking,
[59:26.060 --> 59:31.060]  but it's like the most interesting tidbit of the news
[59:31.220 --> 59:33.220]  and Washington Post had a story
[59:33.220 --> 59:36.940]  and the Guardian had a story today.
[59:36.940 --> 59:39.300]  It's one of these stories where a bunch of organizations
[59:39.300 --> 59:44.100]  have sort of collaborated and seemingly not schemed,
[59:44.100 --> 59:46.940]  but plotted out a, okay, you'll publish this
[59:46.940 --> 59:49.660]  and then we'll publish that on the next day.
[59:49.660 --> 59:51.100]  And it's sort of a drip, drip, drip.
[59:51.100 --> 59:53.060]  Yeah, I mean, these stories often get too big
[59:53.060 --> 59:54.100]  for any one team.
[59:54.100 --> 59:57.460]  And so if a centralized organization says,
[59:57.460 --> 59:59.020]  hey, we've got all of this data,
[59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.860]  they'll often involve multiple newsrooms
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.660]  and the newsrooms will chew over the data themselves, yeah.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.420]  I spoke about this on Dithering,
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.900]  I guess, on the show that came out today.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.740]  I thought the Washington Post story was,
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:15.740]  it's one of my pet peeves is an overly sensational headline
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.460]  and then comparing it with like the webpage title,
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.660]  which might've been the original headline
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.460]  and then they juiced it up.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.460]  But the original title of the Washington Post story,
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.340]  or at least the one that you see in your browser tab,
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.900]  if you're, unless you're using Safari 15
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.300]  where you don't get to see webpage titles
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.460]  in your tabs anymore.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:40.340]  But the non-sensational headline in the browser tab
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.980]  is Apple iPhones were successfully hacked
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.620]  by NSO's Pegasus surveillance tool,
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.980]  which is a terrific headline that would grab my attention
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.340]  and would get me to read it.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.740]  But then on the actual page, the headline is,
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.300]  despite the hype, iPhone security is a big deal.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.540]  Despite the hype, iPhone security,
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.180]  no match for NSO spyware, which is true.
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.860]  I can't say there's a false word in that headline,
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.100]  but it paints a very different picture
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.420]  as to the scope of it.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.940]  And then the sub headline, which I think tells you
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.180]  the scope is international investigation
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.260]  finds 23 Apple devices that were successfully hacked.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.100]  Right.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.260]  Your thoughts.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:32.260]  Yeah, I mean, 23 is out of over a billion is pretty good.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:37.180]  Even 23 out of 50,000 is pretty good,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.260]  you know, in terms of percentages.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.980]  But in reality, you go into these things looking at,
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.860]  I feel like the most important things to look at
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.060]  are the technical realities.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.060]  And so the technical reality of the situation
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.340]  is that NSO's, some of NSO's zero clicks
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.140]  worked on versions of iOS up to 14.6.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.980]  And so it's really a matter of,
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.260]  hey, are there current vulnerabilities?
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.980]  Which was literally just for historical context
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.100]  in case anybody's listening to this podcast,
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.060]  not in July, 2021, was literally the current version
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.100]  of iOS until yesterday.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.260]  Right.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.900]  And so for me, it's not really about the number.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.300]  I mean, the number is really how you,
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.300]  that's all about positioning.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.580]  And as you mentioned, you know,
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.020]  kind of choosing how you sensationalize
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.540]  or scope the headline, right?
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.140]  And so you go like, hey, this is a big problem,
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.460]  or is it not a big problem?
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.700]  Well, the fact of the matter is it is a big problem
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.580]  for anybody who's in this kind of work.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.220]  And that scope is much smaller than a billion users, right?
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.140]  So in terms of overall users affected,
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.420]  it's incredibly tiny.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.260]  And that's why I think, you know,
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.140]  you can point to the iPhone being in general
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.900]  kind of affected, effective in terms of general security,
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.740]  because it requires this hyper-targeting
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.780]  by a very intense and well-funded
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:06.020]  and effective organization to properly,
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.780]  and in a very targeted kind of nasty way,
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.780]  utilize these vulnerabilities, right?
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.780]  So it's a little bit of both in that scenario.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.380]  You've got, even amongst their scope,
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.460]  you have a relatively small number of devices
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.620]  that seem to have been compromised,
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.460]  but those are targeted, that's what targeting is all about.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.900]  You know, those single people could be the voice
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.700]  of 10,000 or 10 million individual citizens,
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.500]  because they're reporting on an area, you know,
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.180]  on a regime, in an area where they don't want
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.460]  to be talked about.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.100]  And if they could silence a handful of voices,
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.300]  they'll silence a good amount of the dissent
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.500]  and the exposure of their, you know, the goings on.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.900]  And so that's why it's like a big deal.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.980]  I think that in the aggregate, it's like,
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.100]  whether you position it as something
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.860]  that everybody needs to worry about it or not
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.060]  is really the big deal, you know?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.460]  And I think it, and the second thing,
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.980]  the second part about it is how long did these persist?
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.820]  And as you said, we've got some evidence
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.780]  that these bugs persisted up until the next
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.740]  to latest version of iOS at this point.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.460]  And it's a pretty big deal.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.260]  I wouldn't be surprised if they still persist,
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:24.060]  because I would think if there's any clues
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.900]  in what's been unveiled in this reporting
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.580]  that would give Apple a hint as to what,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.380]  whoa, we should look at this.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.620]  iOS 14.7, which just came out yesterday, might be too soon.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.860]  I wouldn't be surprised if, maybe not all, you know,
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.180]  but some of them still persist.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.620]  And it is interesting, like one of the things
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.580]  that's interesting about this overall reporting
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:51.220]  is that both Amnesty and I think, what is it,
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:55.380]  Citizen something or another,
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.340]  but two, at least two of the people involved in it,
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.180]  Citizen Lab.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.420]  Citizen Lab, yeah, at the University of Toronto.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.420]  Right, and they both confirmed witnessing iPhones
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.060]  running iOS 14.6 be exploited
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.220]  with zero-click vulnerabilities.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.700]  So there's two things that are very interesting
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.020]  about that to me, because most of the times
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.420]  when news about the NSO Group's abilities
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:24.460]  or the GrayKey people, is GrayKey the box
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.780]  or GrayKey the company?
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.620]  I always forget. Doesn't matter.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.780]  Well, whatever they are.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.540]  But that's the outfit that sells law enforcement.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.340]  It's a very different sort of thing,
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.020]  although from Apple's perspective, it still is.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.460]  GrayShift, I think, is the company.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.940]  GrayShift, they sell the GrayKey device,
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.980]  and that's a device that they sell
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.940]  to law enforcement agencies
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.500]  who are in physical possession of somebody's phone,
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.620]  and they connect it by a USB
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:57.380]  and do something that takes control
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.740]  or unlocks the phone and gives them access
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.340]  to the contents of the phone.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:06.460]  Very different in terms of what your risk,
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.060]  if you're like, hey, I don't want these people
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.900]  to have access to the contents of my locked iPhone.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.060]  With the GrayKey, they have your phone
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.500]  and they connect it to this box.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.780]  With NSO Group, it is all remote,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:23.220]  and they just send you an iMessage.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.380]  And this is the part that clearly,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.820]  judging from the email I've gotten
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.220]  from Daring Fireball readers so far,
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.740]  some of them find it hard to believe,
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.300]  and so it's worth talking about,
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.140]  but it's not like you get this message
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.660]  from an unknown phone number
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.380]  and it has a sketchy-looking URL
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:46.340]  and you get hacked if you tap the URL in iMessage,
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.180]  which I'm sure is probably an easier exploit to do
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.020]  and they probably have ones like that.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.220]  Yeah, that's a fish.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.060]  Right.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:57.060]  That does happen, but if you've been thinking,
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.540]  well, I would never tap a fishy-looking URL
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.500]  in an iMessage from an unknown person,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.460]  and I might even be savvy enough
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.780]  that if a message looked like it came from somebody I knew
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.820]  but the URL was weird-looking, I still might not tap it,
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.780]  but this is nothing like that.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.540]  This is a message that shows up on your phone,
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.540]  contains a corrupted GIF image or JPEG
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:30.060]  and the image process, and there might be other exploits too,
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.260]  maybe just URLs with weird strings
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.580]  or binary bytes can trigger it too,
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.300]  but apparently a lot of these bugs are in the image.io
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.140]  subsection, and just by trying to parse the image
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:49.380]  so that it can show it to you, the exploit gets to run.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.220]  Executed, yeah.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.340]  Executed and can see the contents of your phone
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.740]  and do things on your phone.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.380]  It's obviously real.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.420]  These people have confirmed it.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:05.740]  Pretty scary, but the thing to keep in mind,
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.340]  and I think Apple's statement on this is very truthful,
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.380]  that these exploits cost millions of dollars
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.340]  for NSO Group to develop.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.500]  They charge, obviously, more than that,
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.260]  tens of millions of dollars for these countries to use them,
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.900]  and they target specific individuals,
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.740]  but that's not great.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.560]  That's still bad.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.580]  The publicity is terrible, right?
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.340]  Apple wants to protect everybody,
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.900]  and I said this on Dithering 2.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:40.500]  It's like even selfishly, Apple's senior executives
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.620]  have to think that they might be targets too, right?
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.220]  Wouldn't Tim Cook be a legitimate target
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.280]  of a high-level somebody with tens of millions of dollars
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:49.780]  maybe?
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.140]  Of course.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.340]  And getting Tim Cook's phone number probably isn't easy,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.700]  but it's probably a lot easier than attacking
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.500]  Tim Cook in any other way.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.020]  Yeah, exactly, right.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.860]  And you have a scenario where you could easily
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:11.100]  see Tim sending an email about security,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.140]  potential security updates, or being briefed,
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.740]  probably the inverse, right?
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.220]  Being briefed about security updates or changes
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.300]  to, say, iCloud encryption or anything like that.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.380]  And getting access to his phone would give people
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.060]  access to that, which would give them a leg up on iPhone
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.060]  updates.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.500]  There's an enormous array of potential attack surfaces
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.260]  there, so they have to be worried about it.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:36.740]  And for the last four years, the President of the United States
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.180]  was using an iPhone, and everybody knew it.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.740]  And he used it all the time.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.100]  And supposedly, from what I've read,
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:47.360]  they tried to swap it out as frequently as possible
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.620]  with a new device.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:53.900]  But it's like a new era in communications
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:10:00.300]  where even prior to Trump, even with Obama,
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.300]  Obama had a specially hardened Blackberry
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.460]  that the NSA had put together.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.060]  Whereas I don't think, unless if they do it,
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.180]  nobody in public has ever publicized it.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.060]  Nobody's heard it.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.820]  If Apple has a special private secret program
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.180]  to give hardened iPhones to somebody
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.900]  like the President of the United States
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:28.340]  or other leaders of that stature around the world,
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.580]  if that program exists, nobody has ever
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.900]  even whispered about it.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.740]  So I don't think it does.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.900]  I think Tim Cook uses the same iPhone that I use,
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.500]  and you use.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.900]  Yeah, I mean, I do believe that there is a lot,
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.780]  and there is a lot done.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.340]  I have heard that there's a lot done with provisioning
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.540]  to lock down the phone.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.700]  So in that way, there are special precautions taken.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.220]  But as far as a special high security
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.900]  model that runs a different version of the OS, no.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.820]  Not that I've heard of.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.340]  Right.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:02.300]  And the other thing, too, is that it's
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.420]  like security by obscurity is famously not a great strategy
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.540]  if it's your only strategy.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.500]  But it actually does help, right?
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:16.500]  Like whatever the phone is on the desk of the president
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.700]  in the Oval Office, and how that phone is connected
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.220]  to the standard phone lines so that when the president calls
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:30.340]  up somebody, they actually can hear each other.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.540]  A lot of that is secret.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.780]  And that's not enough, and I'm sure that it's actually
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.900]  using actual encryption so that when
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.700]  he calls another senior leader of another G7
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.140]  country around the world, there's
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:48.340]  actual encryption that doesn't have to be secret, right?
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.260]  End-to-end encryption, part that's beautiful about it
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.060]  is that you don't have to be secret about it.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.180]  It's you can tell people exactly how it works, publish it,
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:59.820]  to see if anybody spots any errors in your algorithm
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.860]  or your math.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.020]  And it's just the fact that it's the way that it's
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.860]  supposed to work requires computing power
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.980]  that doesn't exist today.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.980]  But the secrecy is a nice other layer.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.700]  If you don't even know the details of, well,
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.180]  how exactly is that phone connected to the phone network
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.100]  and what is the connection from A to B,
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.500]  if you don't even know that, that's
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.140]  just an added layer of security.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.660]  The fact that a billion people around the world
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.180]  are running the exact same version of iOS
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.460]  on a handful, relatively speaking,
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.540]  handful of hardware devices that anybody can just
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.500]  buy and take apart and study with anything
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.860]  they can get their hands on is sort
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.540]  of unprecedented in electronic communication history.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.340]  Yeah, it is.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:59.380]  And they have the additional layer of, in all reality,
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.380]  they know that Apple is going to be chasing these bugs hard
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.820]  and fixing them hard, so there's an additional layer
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.140]  of scarcity which has created the market.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.820]  It's almost like if there were a ton of bugs in the iPhone
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.180]  at all times, everybody would assume that everything
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.660]  was compromised and not really worry about that
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.500]  and not really commit themselves to doing
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.980]  any sort of high sensitivity comms over the iPhone.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.420]  But instead, there's a reputation
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.460]  for it being hardened, there's a reputation
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:33.340]  for it being hard to hack, and there's
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.740]  a reputation for Apple being all over it and on it
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.220]  and fixing bugs very quickly.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.140]  So there is an enormous market, right?
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.940]  And that's why groups like the NSO group
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.700]  even exist and are able to charge tens of thousands
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.740]  or hundreds of millions or hundreds of thousands
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:52.740]  or even millions of dollars per target
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.980]  that a government wants to target to tackle.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:03.140]  Because they know that without these very secret and very
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:07.260]  fresh bugs and vulnerabilities, there's
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.860]  no way they'll be able to target them.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.420]  So all of their efforts in making the iPhone as secure
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.780]  as possible has actually created the market
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.820]  for this kind of thing.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.300]  Right.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.340]  And it also creates a market for the story
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:22.220]  to be made a big deal out of, right?
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:27.380]  Like, if there's somebody, I'll make mathematically
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:32.420]  extreme hypotheticals, but if there's two basketball players
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.340]  and one player is an 80% free throw shooter
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.860]  and there's another player who's a 99% free throw shooter who
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.140]  hasn't missed a free throw all season,
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:45.060]  the first player misses a free throw at the end of a big game
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.500]  and it's like, well, that happens.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.380]  But if the player who hasn't missed a free throw all season
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.020]  misses one at the end of the game, it's, oh, my God,
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.900]  they missed a free throw at the end of the game.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.980]  But nobody's 100% free throw shooter.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:04.220]  And so it's a bigger deal when a platform that
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.700]  is more secure, not just considered more secure,
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.500]  but by all objective measures of outsiders
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:14.780]  is truly the most secure computing platform for use.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.460]  The fact that it still isn't perfect
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.020]  means that the publicity-wise, when
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.100]  we can prove that it's been taken advantage of
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.660]  and exploited, it's a bigger deal.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.700]  And it's just human nature.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.020]  It's more interesting.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.740]  Yeah, Android devices insecure or Android devices
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.660]  have bugs, news at 11.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.260]  That's a much different ring.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.420]  And not even because Google doesn't do their best.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.100]  I mean, they have security teams and some
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.500]  of the best security researchers in the world.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.860]  But we all know that because of the fragmented nature
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.540]  of Android, people are running all kinds
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.460]  of different versions.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.060]  They have hardware and special versions of Android
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.220]  later on top of it by the manufacturers who may not
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.780]  have the same rigor as Google.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.660]  So this is not a Google bashing exercise, right?
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:57.500]  Because their security teams are top notch.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.940]  But you just know that there is more of a chance there.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.420]  There's much more of a chance that those things could
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.620]  be compromised, and maybe.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:11.940]  And it's just not as big of news, or at least not huge news.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.100]  And maybe news on a specific individual,
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.380]  especially if something unfortunately were to happen
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.900]  to them, or if there was some action taken by a government,
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.140]  and the news comes out, oh, they had an Android device
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.980]  and it was broken into, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.820]  But you attach it to the iPhone, which
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.420]  has a completely different reputation.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.980]  The security teams sort of are able to ensure
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.700]  that the bug fixes that they do put out,
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.220]  they end up on people's devices very quickly
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.220]  within weeks or months of it being published,
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.380]  versus years or never.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.940]  Then it becomes news.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.940]  That's part of that why it's news formula.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.860]  The other thing that's pretty interesting
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.420]  about this particular method of exploit, sending
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.060]  a corrupt image carefully constructed
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.540]  to exploit a bug in image processing in an iMessage,
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.180]  is it's something Apple specifically
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:03.140]  addressed a year ago with a new technology they called
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:07.060]  Blastor, which is exactly what you think, which is sort of,
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.140]  OK, any sort of this.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.700]  And it's in iOS 14.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.700]  It was announced at WWDC last year.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.900]  An image comes to you in iMessage.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.500]  iMessage doesn't try to decode the image right there itself.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.500]  It puts it in this Blastor technology,
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.540]  which is like a sandbox in the sandbox, where
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.940]  the image is processed.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:33.620]  And then only after it is processed there
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:38.100]  does it come out of the Blastor, and it's supposedly safe.
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:43.100]  Obviously, there's holes in the Blastor, apparently.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.060]  Yeah, apparently there's a little too much kiloton,
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:46.900]  future kilotons.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.540]  Right, but it would be interesting to see.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.900]  I mean, and again, you don't really expect Apple to,
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.060]  you know, if they can figure out what's going on here
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.540]  and they close it, you don't really
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.020]  expect Apple to be forthcoming about the exact details
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.060]  of this, both A, because they're Apple
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.620]  and they don't want to talk about it,
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:06.620]  but B, because it's part of the actual security
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.820]  is not tipping their hand so much to the people
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.780]  they're trying to keep out.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.980]  But it is interesting.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.620]  Yeah, their vulnerability disclosures
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.220]  and their bug fix disclosures are typically,
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.380]  hey, we fixed a bug in this particular subroutine
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.540]  or this particular framework.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.900]  But it's an interesting idea, though,
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:31.340]  to encapsulate the entire idea of a corrupt image coming
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.540]  into iMessage.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.420]  And let's just encapsulate the whole thing
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:41.020]  into a safe sub-sandbox is an interesting meta-strategy,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:45.380]  as opposed to let's hire security experts to pour
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.780]  through our source code line by line,
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:55.020]  looking for possible buffer overflows in our C++ code that
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.820]  does the image processing.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:59.260]  You know, tens and probably hundreds of thousands
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.260]  of lines of code, line by line, and trying to figure that out
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.180]  and fix the bugs one by one.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.940]  It's like, instead of playing whack-a-mole,
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.820]  it's an attempt to put the whack-a-mole game into a cage
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.020]  and say, well, who cares?
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.900]  You know, it's all in the cage.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.140]  Yeah, if it doesn't execute, then we can let it in.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.100]  And if it does, then we just sequester it.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:21.700]  Yeah.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.020]  All right, let me take another break here.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.820]  Let's thank our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.180]  I love Squarespace.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.220]  Squarespace is the all-in-one place
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.780]  where you can do everything you need to have your own website.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.420]  You can create the website, design the website,
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.940]  pick a template for your website,
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.540]  pick the features for your website, host it.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:47.540]  And you don't have to worry about any of the meta tasks,
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  the janitorial tasks of owning and running a website,
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.460]  like installing software updates for your OS
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.460]  or software updates for your web server,
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.540]  installing your own analytics package, none of that.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.900]  You don't have to do any of that.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.780]  Squarespace does it all for you.
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.900]  It's easy to use.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.780]  It is consumer-friendly.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.060]  It's the same, you know, it's like the way
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:14.660]  that you can open up Photoshop and manipulate an image visually
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.340]  without knowing any kind of code or something like that.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.380]  Squarespace is that type of interface
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.620]  for designing, creating, hosting your own website.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.340]  They have award-winning tech support.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:29.620]  And it is a tremendous, because it's easy to use,
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.940]  completely visual, completely customizable.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.220]  It is a great solution for you,
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.540]  listener of the talk show,
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.300]  who's quite possibly more computer-savvy
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.940]  than most of the people you know,
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.460]  and therefore might be the person
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.420]  that non-computer-savvy people come to
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:47.060]  when they need a website.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.540]  Rather than you doing it for them or something like that,
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.980]  just send them to Squarespace
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.180]  and send them to Squarespace using the code from this show.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.140]  Why not?
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:56.980]  What do you do?
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:57.820]  Where do you send them?
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.620]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:03.940]  Just remember that, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.740]  They'll know you came from this show.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.380]  You get a free trial, 30 days, no credit card.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:10.700]  And when you do sign up,
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.220]  just head back to the same URL, squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.940]  and use that offer code talk show at checkout
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.460]  and save 10% off your first purchase,
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.180]  which can include, you could just prepay for an entire year.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:25.020]  10% off for an entire year.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.300]  That's squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.860]  My thanks to them for their continuing long-term support
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.140]  as a sponsor of the show.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.100]  I guess the next topic I'll talk about
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:41.100]  is the Safari 15 user interface in Broglio.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.100]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.540]  Yes.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.460]  Which is,
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.500]  I wrote about, I wrote,
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.740]  and I'm really happy with the way that piece came out
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.220]  because I wanted to be careful
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.820]  because I didn't want to come across as an angry crank,
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.340]  but I also didn't want to pussyfoot around the fact
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.980]  that I thought, this is a mistake
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:07.740]  and I don't want to live for a year with this UI.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.780]  I mean, it was so bad, like on the phone,
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.620]  when I installed beta one of iOS 15 on a spare iPhone,
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.060]  that I was genuinely thinking if they stick with this UI,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.860]  I genuinely have to think about
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.660]  not getting a new iPhone next year
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:27.140]  and keeping my iPhone 12 on iOS 14
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.940]  and hope that they fix it.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.100]  And its own vulnerabilities and all.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:32.940]  Right, right.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.780]  Well, and hopefully they will,
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.380]  well, I guess with iOS, it's hard to,
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.940]  yeah, you don't really get to do that.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.420]  It's like with macOS, you can skip a major update
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:42.740]  and still get minor updates to the older version,
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.060]  but with iOS- Yeah, for security and other things, yeah.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.540]  Right, but with iOS, if you don't upgrade to the iOS 15,
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.300]  you're running an outdated OS.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.860]  Yeah, in my opinion, too, by the way,
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.740]  this is hearkening back to our earlier discussion about NSO,
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:00.060]  but they really should divorce security updates from that.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.240]  I know they do put out minor patches all the time
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.040]  for security patches and updates.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.240]  And they have in the past,
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.100]  if it's a vulnerability that's a big problem,
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.740]  come out with security patches for older versions of iOS.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:13.940]  You've seen this happen in the past.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.780]  Right.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.780]  But I feel that they should be wholly divorced from it
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.020]  and they should be just like it happens on macOS,
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.400]  where you get a little security update
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.660]  and maybe it's automatically applied,
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.020]  maybe you manually apply it depending on your settings,
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.260]  but it's just like a blip and it updates
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.820]  and maybe you restart, maybe you don't,
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.500]  and you never have to worry about it, right?
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:37.100]  I think they should update the update system for iOS
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.880]  to support immediate security updates.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.900]  And maybe they're already working on this,
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.980]  but it should be near real time.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.580]  Hey, we've got a fix.
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.540]  We validated it.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.400]  It's ready to ship.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.300]  Okay, cool.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.300]  Wait for six weeks.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.060]  No, you know, ship it now, immediately.
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.620]  It'll go out to everybody's phone tonight
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.180]  and tomorrow morning they'll wake up
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.660]  and they'll be like, hey, we patched it.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.660]  It's a little security update.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.940]  Don't worry, everything else is the same.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.180]  Like in my opinion, it should be separate from it.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.460]  Well, a lot like the way the Mac does it,
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.620]  where you don't get divorced
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:13.100]  from pretty steady security updates
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.580]  just because you're running last year's version of macOS
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:19.380]  or two years ago's version of macOS.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.820]  And you know, there's a limit to it.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:21.960]  I think two years,
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:27.140]  if they keep all these systems on an annual schedule,
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.260]  two major versions is pretty good.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:32.780]  One major version I think would be the minimum
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:34.780]  because I think there's a lot of people I'm sure of it.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.460]  I mean, I'm an idiot and I get new phones every year
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:41.340]  and I'm already running the iOS 15 beta on a spare phone.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.500]  And if so far, it's pretty,
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.100]  I like iOS 15 overall on the phone.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.420]  So if it wasn't for Safari,
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.420]  I'd be very tempted to put beta three
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.280]  or maybe the next beta on my regular day-to-day phone.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:59.300]  End of July is often when I start running
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:03.980]  the summer next big version of iOS on my daily phone
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.420]  just to get used to it.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.820]  But I realized that there's an awful lot of people out there
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.580]  who are much wiser than I am.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.340]  And they're just genuinely
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:17.180]  very conservative about it, right?
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:20.780]  iOS 13 shipped and it was sort of a disaster.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.340]  I mean, that disaster is overstating it,
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.420]  but that was the version two years ago
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.620]  where the new hardware came out with iOS 13.0.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.820]  13.0 never shipped to people as an upgrade.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.100]  13.1 did, like three days
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.780]  after the phones started shipping to people.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.780]  And then they shipped a bunch of updates sequentially.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:44.820]  Yeah, and even iOS 13.1 was for this,
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.040]  by the standards of a non-beta iOS release
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.580]  was extremely buggy.
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.620]  Just, it just was.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.940]  I mean, was it unusable?
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.580]  No, it wasn't like, you know,
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.540]  people's phones were breaking left and right,
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.020]  but lots of crashes and just weird stuff.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.620]  It just, it was just a collision
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:04.740]  of Apple's annual hardware schedule with the,
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:07.180]  oh, the software's not quite on the same schedule,
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.100]  but the hardware can't run iOS 12,
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.180]  so we have to ship iOS 13, whether it's ready or not.
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.740]  And so there's people who very reasonably
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.460]  would look at that situation and think,
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:22.340]  well, I'm never going to update to iOS new dot whatever
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.900]  until it gets to like new point two,
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.960]  maybe like, you know, like the first one,
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.700]  first update that comes out in November.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.180]  That would be like a reasonable rule of thumb,
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:33.300]  but that shouldn't leave them exposed to bugs
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.000]  that are discovered in August or September.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.420]  And you get that, once you get a reputation,
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.060]  that's the difficulty of having this reputation
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.380]  for solid software updates is once you get,
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:49.180]  once you ship one rough one,
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:53.460]  you kind of lose years of rep and years of progress
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.820]  around this idea that everybody can
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.320]  and should update immediately to get all the latest security
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.660]  and patches and updates and all of that.
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.820]  That's why iOS adoption has been so high,
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.140]  because the reputation has been,
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.380]  hey, you may not like every feature
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.920]  and there may be a bug or two here and there,
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.060]  but mostly it's going to be fine.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.980]  Just update immediately, right?
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:13.500]  And in this case, if you create this reputation
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.740]  for every once in a while, we have a hiccup
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:19.180]  because X, Y, or Z, you know, scheduling conflict,
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.460]  basically with hardware, that's okay.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.180]  You're still going to get the security updates, right?
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.740]  Like that should be the state
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.400]  rather than having to rely on your perfection
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.500]  in shipping new software every year,
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.780]  day in, year in, year out,
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.140]  because every once in a while,
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.900]  some shit's going to happen, you know?
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.220]  And when it happens, you don't have to worry
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:40.620]  about people not updating security patches,
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.380]  because those are on a separate track.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.620]  That would be why.
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.340]  And then there's the emoji track, right?
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.700]  You and I have talked about this on the show before,
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.740]  but I know it sounds like a gag,
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:53.020]  but it really is true that there's an awful lot of people
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:55.260]  over the years who, you know,
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:59.420]  will like silence their update, iOS update alerts.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.800]  But then as soon as they get like a message from a friend
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.400]  that has like an emoji that shows up as a square
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.140]  with an X in it, and they're like, what's that?
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.780]  And they're like, oh, you don't have the new emoji
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.900]  for whatever?
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.260]  And they're like, new emoji?
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.020]  And it's like immediately leave the chat,
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.640]  go to settings, general software update.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:18.300]  Yeah, I can tell you from personal experience
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.120]  that we published like,
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.700]  hey, there's a bunch of new emoji in iOS.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.540]  Those articles, boom, people love that.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:25.380]  But they do, I don't think it's a coincidence that those,
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.260]  hey, here's this year's new emoji
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.300]  usually come out in the point two release, right?
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.740]  It's like, this is when the OS is really solid.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.380]  We really do want- Juice the numbers a bit, yeah.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.700]  Let's get everybody on it, you know, get the new-
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.060]  I love it, yeah.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:46.500]  What was your take on the Safari UI changes?
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.540]  I mean, so I always try to resist having like violent,
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.460]  you know, reactions to these things
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.900]  simply because I do feel it's human nature, right?
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.340]  And you're gonna look at it and you're gonna go,
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.660]  oh, you know, this is new and it's terrible
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:02.740]  and God dang it, you know,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.260]  and it doesn't work the way it used to.
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:07.420]  And so you have to kind of get past that.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.000]  So I've been trying to get past that a bit.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.580]  Now, some people are probably more sure of themselves
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.500]  and more able to distance their thinking
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.580]  from, you know, that immediate reaction,
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.940]  but I know myself, right?
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.180]  And so I know that I'll have the hot take in my own brain
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.500]  right away, and I need to let the hot take pass
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.020]  and kind of live with it a bit.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.940]  And so like on iOS, there are a few things.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:32.020]  I think that a hybrid of the old and new models,
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:34.880]  it will actually be better than what they currently have.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.900]  So like the current new model doesn't really work,
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.740]  I don't think.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.140]  And I think they need to tweak it in many small ways,
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.700]  but I don't mind certain things about it.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.560]  I actually do like the bottom bar.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:51.020]  I think it's fine, but the tab switching is really funky.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:53.940]  The new tab handling, I think is really awkward
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.320]  and I don't know why anybody would ever want to manage
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.100]  their tabs this way.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:02.380]  But the bottom bar is nice, the bottom navigation is nice.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.260]  I like that aspect.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.820]  It's way too finicky, and once again,
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.960]  beta software, caveats included, et cetera, right?
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.620]  But it's like way too finicky right now
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:15.540]  about what happens when you're trying to like enter a URL
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.260]  and like, you know, when you enter a URL,
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.860]  it goes back to the old way, right?
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:24.020]  Like you enter it, you enter a search term or whatever,
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:26.820]  it looks just like iOS 14 does.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.900]  You know, once you enter it.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.600]  And I think that that's confusing, right?
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.340]  The mode switching, it's like, which one is it, right?
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.460]  And so you have to kind of get that,
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.380]  wrap your head around that.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:42.380]  When that model though is translated from iOS to Mac OS,
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.440]  in addition to the things that you mentioned,
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.320]  like page titles, which I rely heavily on,
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.540]  variety of other things like the close icon
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.580]  being hidden behind the icon, the...
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.940]  The favicon, right? The favicon, yeah.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:00.620]  Like why, you should never destroy a brand.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.540]  Right. You know what I mean?
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.700]  Like, that's not, Apple above all
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.620]  should understand the power of like,
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.060]  I'm gonna click on this to delete it.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.780]  You know, that doesn't, don't do that.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:10.500]  You know, you should never click, do that.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.660]  You think you're clicking on
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:13.860]  the little green TechCrunch logo
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.060]  and you didn't realize it because your mouse,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.380]  you're good and accurate with the mouse
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.220]  and you've just closed the tab.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.500]  Right, right, and then it's split second,
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.460]  you know, that it changes over to the close.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.060]  You didn't notice and boom, you know, you've closed it.
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:28.000]  So there's things like that.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.220]  I don't like at all on iPad
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.060]  and even on Mac OS to some degree,
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:37.240]  well, not some degree, it happens all the time,
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:42.240]  but this floating bar that goes across multiple tabs
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.640]  and windows is awful, in my opinion.
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.300]  Like this sort of like, you've seen this thing, right?
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.460]  This super, superseding bar that sort of hovers
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:55.900]  over the top of say two side-by-side Safari pages.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.460]  I find that to be enormously distracting.
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.620]  I think they should be,
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.820]  it should be on the active window, right?
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.440]  Like, you know, if you're, if you're tap,
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.300]  if you tap into one Safari window, the bar should be there.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.260]  If you tap into the other one, it should move over, right?
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.140]  Animated, have fun with that, but don't, you know,
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.860]  don't make it, what bar am I entering text into?
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:14.860]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.620]  Or what window am I entering text into?
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:19.500]  It's the same old active window shit
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.300]  that we've dealt with for years on desktop.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.420]  Like you need to know which window's active.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:26.500]  You know, even Chrome, every day, every third party app
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.040]  will tell you which window's active
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.260]  by a slight change in UI.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.740]  And that's, that's what's missing there for me.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.980]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's a lack of physicality.
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.300]  You know, it's, there's, there's like
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:43.620]  the traditional interface for tabs is very,
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:47.260]  it is analogous to physical paper
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.700]  or cardboard tabs on folders, right?
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.580]  There's, there's like a connection.
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.220]  And then there's, even though they,
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.100]  there's much less three-dimensional depth
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:00.720]  in our user interfaces today across all operating systems.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.640]  I mean, that's a trend that is simply decade long everywhere
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.900]  that there's less fake 3D depth,
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.340]  but there's still, it's like it, in Safari 14,
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.800]  it's like, there's a connection.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.900]  The active tab is connected to the stuff above it.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.300]  And it tells you, oh, this is the one that's active.
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.400]  And all these other tabs I might have open
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.060]  are behind it a little bit,
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:26.300]  a little bit of depth behind it.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.300]  And if you do click on one of those,
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:32.620]  then they get the, the line disappears and it looks active.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:35.660]  And it's, you don't even have to think about it, right?
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.900]  It's like, the more you talk about it,
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.660]  you feel silly because it seems so obvious,
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:44.240]  but it's like, it's this whole affordance that you,
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.640]  because it's the way our brains work,
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.540]  you don't even have to think about it.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:51.880]  Whereas this new interface is something that no matter,
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.460]  they could tweak it and make the contrast
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:58.100]  more between the active one or something like that.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.500]  But it's still something you have to think about
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.060]  because it's not analogous
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.860]  to the way anything works in the real world.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:09.460]  Yeah, you're forced with either hoping that it's correct
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.820]  or adding an additional step, right?
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.380]  To every action that you take
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.620]  to make sure that you're typing in the right window
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.420]  or that you're acting on the right thing.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:22.700]  And so if you, if you're gonna do that,
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.300]  if you're gonna bet on that model,
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.620]  then you had better either guess
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.620]  what the user wants to do right 99.999% of the time,
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.620]  or make it easier for them to see at a glance.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.800]  And I don't think they're capable of guessing
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.660]  which window I wanna type in at all times.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.500]  I just don't.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:44.540]  So you need to make sure to make it extremely evident
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:45.540]  which one I'm in.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.540]  And right now the current design does not do that.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.740]  I think more interesting though,
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.540]  has been the fact that a month or five, six weeks
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:01.540]  after WWDC, Apple has clearly taken
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.660]  the public criticism of it to heart
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.140]  in a way that people, I think has taken,
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.500]  I think as surprised as people who care
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.540]  about the Safari user interface
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.140]  might've been by what they saw
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:17.000]  from what was shown at WWDC,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.180]  people seem more surprised that Apple
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.860]  is immediately taking the feedback
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:25.740]  and tweaking what they've, what they're shipping
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.360]  and that they've changed the tabs in Mac Safari to be,
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.240]  again, there's a lack of a physical analogy
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.180]  to the visual style of the tabs,
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:38.540]  but there is a tab bar now where there wasn't
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.180]  in the version in June.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:44.560]  And the iPhone one has seen some significant tweaks.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.340]  And though the iPad version hasn't changed,
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.240]  they off the record told me
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.560]  and they told other reporters and journalists
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.660]  that it just didn't make it into beta three.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.460]  iPad, OS, Safari is going to see changes
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.940]  much like what we've seen with Safari for Mac already.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:09.300]  And emphasize to me that there are,
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.640]  they're listening to the feedback.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.180]  This is why they're doing the beta.
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:15.420]  This is why they have the public beta program
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.660]  for non-developers for these versions.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.020]  And they really are listening
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:24.780]  and there are a lot more changes to come,
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.820]  even though it doesn't seem like
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.900]  there's a lot of time for it.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.060]  And I guess part of that too is that
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.840]  they don't necessarily have to make all the changes
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.840]  by 15.0 shipping probably in September with new iPhones,
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.840]  that they could ship even further ones in 15.1.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.160]  But there's a sense of hustle on their end
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.820]  of okay, let's address this.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:49.880]  And I kind of get the feeling,
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.200]  both from private conversations I've had
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.400]  with some friends at Apple
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.400]  and the background discussions I've had semi-officially,
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.700]  putting it all together,
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.560]  I kind of get the sense that,
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.060]  and this is so not surprising,
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.700]  but we just never know about this,
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.300]  but that this design was not universally popular
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:17.540]  within Apple before WWDC, right?
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.540]  That there's, a lot of this stuff comes together
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.020]  in the weeks leading up to WWDC
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.620]  and the final decision of,
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.340]  okay, what are we gonna put in the keynote?
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.420]  What are we gonna emphasize?
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.660]  What are we gonna make like a five minute segment about?
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.380]  And what is even gonna make it into iOS 15?
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:35.460]  Maybe, I'm sure there are various projects
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:38.620]  in various apps around iOS and macOS,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.220]  maybes for this year's OSes,
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.700]  and we're like, well, not ready yet, let's hold it.
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.860]  And maybe we'll ship it mid-year,
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.740]  like they do with a lot of stuff now,
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.500]  like in a 15.5 update,
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.940]  but we won't even talk about it now
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.340]  because we don't wanna promise it.
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.640]  Or maybe we'll wait till next year, who knows?
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.740]  And then all of a sudden in May,
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:00.740]  there's a lot more Apple employees internally
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:04.980]  who are running the pre-beta builds of what's iOS 15.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:08.380]  And a lot of them, when they saw the new Safari,
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.540]  were like, what, what is going on?
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:14.060]  They were like, not just like, this is bad,
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.500]  but like, this is confusing.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:19.340]  Like, I work at Apple and I'm an engineer
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.760]  or a designer or somebody,
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.180]  and I consider myself a pretty savvy web browser user.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.220]  I'm confused by Safari now.
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.380]  And Safari is supposedly, you know,
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:33.380]  and historically, an exquisitely well-crafted
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.900]  user interface for a browser.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:39.540]  Like all arguments about web standards
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:44.540]  and Chrome being on the leading edge of supporting,
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.500]  for lack of a better catch-all phrase,
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:50.220]  application development within the browser
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:52.940]  as web technology, as apps,
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.640]  versus Safari's more conservative stance
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.260]  on embracing new standards as they come out
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.740]  or are proposed even.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.580]  Putting all that aside, just the browser engine aside,
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:10.020]  Safari is known for having a terrific user interface
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.180]  for a web browser.
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.980]  And then all of a sudden there's a version
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:15.980]  and people are lost and don't even know what tab they're on
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:19.120]  and where do I see the page title?
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.380]  How do I get to my bookmark?
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:24.220]  How do I get to my bookmarks is the weirdest problem to me.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.140]  Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of things.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.340]  I mean, you outlined some of them,
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:29.980]  so it's not like we need to re-litigate ad nauseam,
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.600]  but there's a bunch of stuff about it
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.100]  that is just really confusing.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:36.800]  Like, you know, having the, you know,
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.980]  every action on Safari, even mobile Safari,
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.020]  especially mobile Safari where, you know,
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:44.660]  it needs to be quicker than anything, you know.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.620]  Having every action disappear under one, two,
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.960]  or even three layers of disambiguation.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.020]  You know, you gotta drill down several layers
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.780]  to get to just the standard share sheet,
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.940]  two layers at least.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.460]  There's just a bunch of stuff like that.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.900]  The bottom bar, famously, famously,
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:04.640]  Safari has been a browser across all platforms
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.380]  that has honored web content the best that it can
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.740]  and rendered it extremely well.
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.620]  And then on mobile Safari especially,
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.460]  it has done and famously was the first browser
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.980]  to treat web content as native content
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.260]  and to get out of its way
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.340]  and to maximize screen real estate, all of this.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.340]  And then you have now this bottom bar,
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.020]  which I actually really like in terms of like,
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.100]  hey, I'm gonna smash into this and type something
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.580]  and, you know, get it going.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.820]  But then it acts weird.
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:38.320]  Like, you know, you type on it to tap
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.200]  and now it's at the top.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.520]  Okay, that was just at the bottom,
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.060]  but now it's at the top and you're typing.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.340]  And then you type at the top.
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:44.160]  Okay, fine.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:46.100]  And I hit go, but now it goes back to the bottom.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:47.560]  And if there's a piece of content
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.000]  at the bottom of the screen that I wanna read,
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.060]  I have to scroll down a little bit to make it go away.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.820]  But not too much, because if I scroll too much,
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:55.540]  then I'm, you know, then now it pops back up, you know.
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.860]  It's just really weird.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:00.000]  You know, it really is a little flighty at the moment.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.860]  And, you know, speaking in terms of a browser
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.060]  that you expect to treat screen real estate with respect
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.280]  and be extremely crisp and conservative
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.060]  in taking over parts of the real estate,
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:17.060]  that floating bar is really cool for input
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:20.520]  and not so great for reading, you know,
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.860]  and output, I guess you'd call it.
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.960]  And like that, that is the part of it
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.380]  that needs to be figured out, I think.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.820]  Yeah, it feels, for lack of a better term,
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:30.320]  it feels a little dishonest,
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.660]  because the floating bar creates the illusion
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:37.820]  that because it's floating and it doesn't take up
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.700]  the whole bottom of the display,
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.260]  it's letting you see more content behind it.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:47.160]  But there's a drop shadow and there's the system bar
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:50.500]  for, you know, like to get to the home screen.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.300]  And there's a drop shadow, did I say drop shadow?
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.060]  But there's a drop shadow and there's this bar,
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:56.280]  and there's not much room.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.260]  So you can't read that text anyway.
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:02.780]  It might as effectively, so at a glance,
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:06.460]  it creates the illusion that it's letting more content
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.380]  at the bottom of the screen show through,
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.700]  but it's absolutely unusable and untappable,
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.380]  and it's just a bit weird.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.820]  But I'm heartened by the fact that Apple is hustling
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:21.220]  to address the criticism and maybe, you know,
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:24.900]  just showed their wildest version of a new idea
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.340]  and are quickly backtracking on it.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:30.660]  The thing I'm reminded of was the iOS mail,
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.060]  iPhone mail redesign, I think two years ago,
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.080]  that took five buttons at the bottom of mail
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.740]  and turned it into one button
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.460]  that just looked like the reply button.
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:44.640]  And when you hit that reply button,
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.880]  it opened up something like a popover,
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.900]  like the sharing sheet, that had all the stuff
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.220]  you could do with the message.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.220]  And they had all this room.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.940]  So in the name of minimalism, it's kind of cool to just say,
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:02.180]  well, we've simplified mail down to one button.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.340]  But you haven't really, you've just simplified it
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.140]  to a junk drawer where you've put all the buttons
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.140]  and you had this room to put the other buttons.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.940]  And they eventually put those buttons back
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:14.700]  and mail is a lot more like it used to be,
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:17.260]  but it didn't happen immediately.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:20.960]  You know, it didn't happen in July after WWDC.
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:29.660]  I find that to be a positive sign,
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.620]  that they're immediately taking action
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.660]  and considering criticism.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:37.300]  Not reacting, it's not like a,
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.800]  I don't think there's anything knee-jerk about it,
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.180]  but they're just considering criticism.
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:46.140]  And truly, must be a lot of it is internal,
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:48.040]  just internal people at Apple who are like,
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.260]  yeah, this is what I was saying.
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:53.980]  This looks cool, maybe, but isn't actually usable,
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:55.820]  so therefore it's not a great design.
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:00.300]  Yeah, yeah, I think a lot of it really boils down to that.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:05.300]  It's like, in concept, this idea that you have less
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.300]  on the screen that isn't content is a great idea, right?
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:15.180]  That's a theological statement that rings true
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:18.140]  with how, I'm just being a mobile safari at this point,
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.580]  but this applies to iPadOS as well.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:25.260]  But if you go from that philosophical standpoint,
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.660]  it sounds legit.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.180]  It sounds like you know what's up.
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:30.060]  You are following the plan.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.840]  You are, yes, what you're doing right now
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.500]  is exactly what we've always done.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.180]  But then when you actually use it,
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.980]  you realize that it actually clutters the screen more
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.420]  and makes it a little more confusing
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.540]  and doesn't really give you much more screen real estate
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.020]  unless you take action, like scrolling.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.860]  And that makes it kind of weird
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.680]  and makes the execution a little bit subpar.
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.180]  All right, let me take one last break here
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.900]  to thank our fourth and final sponsor of the day,
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.700]  but near and dear to my heart, Linode.

[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.620]  you can get 24-7 tech support.
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:27.060]  No, you can get their smallest, cheapest,
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:30.180]  most affordable consumer sort of hobbyist plan
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.260]  you still get, nonstop support every day of the year,
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:35.720]  every hour of the day.

[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.640]  and manage everything yourself
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.700]  with supported centralized tools like Terraform.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.740]  They offer the best price to performance value
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.440]  for all compute instances, including GPUs,
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.460]  as well as block storage, Kubernetes,
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:07.900]  and their upcoming bare metal release.

[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.320]  I love them, they're great.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.780]  Last topic, here's the last thing I wanna talk about,
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.480]  and this is, I don't have a lot to say about it
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.320]  because we don't have new,
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.540]  there's no new hardware since the iMacs,
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.980]  but in some sense, post WWDC,
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.980]  we're one year into the Apple Silicon era for the Mac,
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.620]  because that's where they announced it last year.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.900]  I think it is very, very clear now
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:12.900]  that any new Macs models that will go from Intel
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:17.500]  to Apple Silicon are gonna happen in the fall
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.640]  at the earliest.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:22.900]  So I would be, I would truly be surprised
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.800]  if they did Mac hardware in August.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.960]  It just, especially coming out of 2020.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.520]  I'm curious to your thoughts now that it's settled in
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.860]  and we at least have a sense of the consumer Mac hardware
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.060]  on Apple Silicon, where you see this.
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.980]  I would say starting from that round table
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.020]  that you and I were at a couple of years ago
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.160]  to where they are now.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:55.220]  You mean in terms of where the ecosystem is?
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.460]  Yeah. What the status is?
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:00.240]  And what it means for the Mac's position in the industry.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.860]  Yeah, it's an interesting one.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:08.340]  I mean, I find it, one thing I find interesting
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:11.620]  is the timing of the Mac Pro and the M1, right?
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:13.860]  So you have the Mac Pro being,
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.780]  you mentioned the round table
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.580]  and you mentioned the kind of state of play.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.140]  I think a lot of people are very interested
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.380]  to see how the M1 plays in more pro contexts, right?
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:24.740]  Because we've already established
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.360]  that it's actually incredibly powerful
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.520]  and for developer work, existing memory configurations
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.620]  and existing power configurations
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.560]  already are quite capable.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:36.940]  But a lot of people want more, which is understandable,
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:37.780]  right?
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.200]  You know, people just want more RAM,
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.520]  they want more juice and all of that stuff.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.520]  So this next era of like pro tier M processors,
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.840]  there's the potential, there's two potentials that I see.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:55.880]  One, they enter into this era,
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.240]  introduce a bunch of M1 hardware and memory configurations,
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.560]  which will be fixed
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.680]  because of the nature of the M1 architecture, right?
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.760]  These are not going to be upgradeable configurations.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.960]  Right.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.960]  And they underwhelmed from a memory standpoint,
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.480]  but over time, software manufacturers,
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.440]  you know, are able to sort of tweak
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.780]  and massage their software to work on the M1
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:30.780]  and to work in a more efficient way with unified memory,
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:34.840]  right, which is the Apple's big flag plant
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:38.220]  that UMA is the future of memory architecture
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.760]  and that people should just get on board, right?
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.520]  That's their big statement.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.080]  Beyond the, you know, M1 being their own chip,
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.560]  the idea that it has this unified memory pool
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.080]  and that speed of memory is much more important
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.280]  than any other thing, you know,
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.060]  or than capacity, I should say.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.500]  And they get on board with that
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.740]  and they tweak their software over time slowly
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.540]  and people come around to it.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:05.280]  The other possibility is that they go into this era
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.280]  with a similar kind of massive performance advantage
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.520]  to where the M1 is now in comparison to other processors.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.160]  In other words, I'm interested to see
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.640]  whether this next layer of hardware
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.320]  that they have laid down is of a similar kind of leap
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:33.880]  over existing pro hardware that it would ostensibly
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.000]  compete with from other manufacturers.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  And this would put them,
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.680]  they're already maybe two years ahead to three years ahead,
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.760]  and this would put them like five, six years ahead
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  of Intel and anybody else.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:47.160]  And I'm interested to see what happens there.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.520]  So in other words, will it be really good
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.400]  but needs cooperation from software manufacturers
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.200]  or so enormously powerful that it really doesn't matter
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.160]  whether software manufacturers wanna keep up
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.400]  or not, it's still gonna be the best computer
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.800]  for the dollar that you can buy on the market
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.320]  regardless of brand.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.000]  And I think that's the two sort of outcomes
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  that I'm interested in seeing, which one happens.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  And I think the M1, the current M1,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.520]  already almost takes scales into that second category.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.820]  It's so powerful that most applications
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:24.000]  did not need to be updated at all and still ran faster.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:24.840]  Right? Right?
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.640]  Under Rosetta or Rosetta 2.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:29.800]  And so if you're in a market where you can take
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.480]  any pro application, especially those in the academic worlds
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.480]  and or big processing house effects worlds and video worlds
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.400]  and say, hey, you know that current video app that you use,
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.240]  they don't need to touch a single line of code
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.120]  and the performance of this machine
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:49.800]  will still blow away anything else.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.320]  And when they get their shit together, it'll be 5X.
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.160]  Right.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.760]  And then you've got this just unbeatable lead,
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.680]  you know, ahead of them.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.520]  Yeah.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.080]  The thing that when I look back at it is like,
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.280]  let's say this is year one.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.240]  The thing that becomes more clear strategically is that,
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:15.000]  and maybe I'm off base here because it's pure speculation,
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  but it just seems to me that Apple's chip making prowess,
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.440]  prowess, Johnny Srouji's entire division
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:29.440]  has just sort of spread like liquid,
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.920]  you know, that it starts somewhere and you think,
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.600]  oh, it's spilt over there.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.880]  And then it just keeps spreading,
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.400]  but it keeps spreading in a pro direction.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.280]  And by pro I specifically mean people who need
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.040]  the absolute utmost of performance,
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.080]  you know, the very fastest CPU's and GPU's
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.000]  and the most cores and the most RAM
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.360]  and the highest IO performance writing to disk.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:00.560]  And it just, it's almost seems like, well, duh.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.800]  Yeah, cause it started,
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.040]  they started making phone processors, right?
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.800]  They started with three and a half inch screen,
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.080]  you know, I forget which iPhone had the first Apple Silicon.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.080]  I think it was, you know,
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:16.080]  or maybe it was the iPad that had the A4 chip.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.560]  Right.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.520]  And at a time when the iPad really was clearly
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.080]  just a big iPhone, you know,
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:27.320]  and then the A4, the same chip was in the iPhone that year.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.320]  And they've spread from these phones,
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.520]  which clearly were less powerful computing devices
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:39.520]  than desktop or 16 inch pro laptop computers.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.240]  Because of course, of course they are, right?
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.080]  And then they got to this crazy point where,
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.600]  no, that wasn't true anymore.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.080]  And your phone actually was not just like,
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.840]  hey, this is actually in the ballpark.
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.920]  It was like, no, it's actually like run this benchmark,
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.480]  that benchmark, and it's like, no, it's just faster.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:00.560]  It's faster at single core, faster at multi-core
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.400]  or faster at multi-core up to, you know,
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:07.440]  a ridiculous number of cores in like Intel Xeon type thing.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.360]  But there's nothing, and that they've just, you know,
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.960]  year by, you know, why did it take them so long to switch
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.720]  when just going by pure benchmarks?
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:19.880]  Clearly they could have had very performant Macs
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.360]  running on some hypothetical, you know,
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:26.320]  instead of the M1 could have come out three years earlier
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.160]  and it would have been performant enough to be worth buying.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.840]  It just wouldn't have been so blow away good.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.280]  And it's like, oh, of course you have to wait another year
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.740]  to get to the pro hardware.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:40.280]  And that's sort of what makes it a different transition
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:43.800]  than the previous transitions Apple's gone under,
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.700]  specifically the Intel one, right?
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:50.700]  When they went from 68K to PowerPC, PowerPC was all new.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.320]  It was, you know, Apple was one of the founding partners,
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.420]  you know, it was with what, Apple IBM and Motorola.
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:02.240]  But it was designed as, from the get-go,
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.080]  from when the partnership was announced,
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.800]  PowerPC was intended to span the gamut
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.800]  from consumer PCs like G3 iMacs
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.240]  to what were then called workstations,
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.080]  like a word that just isn't really tossed around anymore.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.080]  But, you know, that's like what today's Mac Pro is.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.700]  It's a Unix professional workstation.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.280]  But Intel, when Apple switched to Intel was already,
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.160]  you know, long established and the idea was,
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.560]  look, it's, you know, Steve Jobs phrased it so gracefully
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:40.520]  so it didn't look like Apple was throwing in the towel.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.760]  But yet that's what they were doing.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.560]  They're like, you know what, if you can't beat them,
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.100]  join them and we're just gonna have
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.480]  the performance of Intel.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.360]  And so of course, some of the first Intel iMacs
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.160]  were truly pro configurations
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:55.440]  because the designs were already there.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.560]  Whereas, I just think that the simple explanation
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:03.520]  for why did Apple ship, you know, Mac Mini and MacBook Air
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.880]  and the two-port 13-inch MacBook Pro
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.880]  and a consumer-sized 24-inch,
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.200]  but beautiful super-thin iMac
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.440]  as the first Apple Silicon Macs,
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.240]  it's because it's simply that their chip design abilities
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:26.240]  are expanding from phones to pro workstations.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.640]  And it's that simple.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.920]  And of course it took another year
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.800]  or will take another year before we start seeing it.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.140]  Yeah, it's basically like a ripple.
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:36.600]  They're rippling outwards from the phone
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.980]  and then towards the pro market.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:45.260]  I do think that the decade of concentration
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:51.700]  and prioritization of performant software,
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.760]  and I know that Apple executives
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.360]  will be the first people to tell you,
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:00.560]  oh, it's our combination of software and hardware
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.320]  that allow us to do what we do.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.920]  Yes, true, it's true, right?
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.480]  And it's hard to say anything like it
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.000]  without sounding like a marketing brochure, unfortunately,
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.200]  because they do lean into that,
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.520]  because it is accurate, right?
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.560]  They write the software, stack,
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.960]  they have that whole shebang going for them.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.100]  And so when they create hardware or move into hardware,
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.560]  they're gonna have an advantage.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.380]  But I do feel that that advantage
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:25.840]  is informing how they expand these things
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.400]  and what shape they take,
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.720]  because I do believe that like UMA, for instance,
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.360]  as an example, is an enormous bet.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  It's a gutsy, like hubris-laden bet, right?
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.520]  That this is a, that a sea change in architecture
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:50.880]  of the way that processors and memory interrelate
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.040]  is gonna happen at the same time
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:56.560]  that a massive change in actual processor architecture
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:59.000]  for desktop computers and mobile computers
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.160]  is being affected.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.240]  It's not just that they're changing
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.880]  from Intel to Apple Silicon to ARM.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.800]  It's also that they are introducing UMA
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.620]  as the way of the future of all computing.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.320]  And if software manufacturers buy in,
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.320]  and if the systems keep advancing in power as they do,
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.640]  they could effectively change
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.800]  the way all computers are made, and probably will, right?
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:31.480]  You're already seeing Intel fainting in that direction
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.220]  and moving in that direction and other ARM processors.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:37.760]  And the fact is that they could not do this
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:41.800]  without a decade's worth of experience
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:45.420]  living in an oxygen-thin environment, right?
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.180]  Like the ARM processors were not
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:48.820]  the most powerful processors in the universe
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:50.320]  when they started, right?
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.480]  They worked for them because they worked
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.820]  at a low power level so that the battery
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:57.780]  actually would last, right?
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.120]  They worked in a power-constrained environment
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.080]  for a decade.
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.300]  So even if you say,
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.880]  hey, an iPad is just as powerful as a MacBook,
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.800]  yes, but it's still a battery-powered device, right?
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:10.640]  That goes in your pocket so it can't get hot, right?
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.880]  Yes, yeah, the phone that goes in your pocket,
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.200]  the iPad goes in your bag.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.720]  There's all kinds of limits and constraints.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.240]  And it really is, it's like,
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.320]  they've been coning at the wheel of pain, right?
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:30.180]  Like walking around in circles for a decade,
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:32.860]  growing from like this scrawny kid
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:36.140]  into this beastly barbarian,
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:37.960]  but they still have the chains on, right?
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:39.540]  They're still attached to the wheel of pain,
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:41.560]  AKA batteries, right?
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:45.400]  And then when they're able to move off battery power
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.600]  or into a much larger battery,
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.880]  which is a much larger room in a MacBook,
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:54.240]  I think that when you talk about the Mac Pro
[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:57.180]  or iMacs or iMac Pros or whatever models
[01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:59.280]  they come out with in that regard,
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.480]  no battery even in sight, right?
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.480]  So no constraints whatsoever there.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:06.120]  I think we're going to see an enormous explosion
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:10.040]  of computing power here and that the current M1s
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:11.640]  have just given us the taste of.
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:14.000]  I really do feel that there are levels to this
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.600]  and that we haven't seen nearly as much of it
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.000]  as people think we've seen.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.800]  Because I think people view this as a snapshot
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:20.800]  and they're like, hey, the Pro models
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.400]  are gonna have more memory, that's great.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.520]  Maybe a slight bump.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:26.160]  No, I actually think they're gonna be much more powerful
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.980]  because I do feel that UMA is multiplicative.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.000]  It's not additive, right?
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.480]  It's not a scenario where it's like,
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.040]  hey, I'm gonna add an extra 32 gigabytes of RAM to this
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:40.660]  and so we're gonna get 2X capability out of it.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:43.080]  No, I actually think it's gonna be much more
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:44.440]  because of the way that the memory
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.920]  is able to be paged so quickly.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.620]  I really feel it's gonna be a huge, huge jump.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:52.600]  So it's a risk, it's a huge risk,
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:55.160]  and it's a huge bet on all of this stuff.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.000]  But I think they've had enough proving out
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.800]  of all these years of paucity has taught them
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.460]  how to have the system talk to this architecture
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.200]  in a way that gets the most out of it.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:07.440]  And I think they're about to pay all of it off
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.720]  in a really, really big way.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:11.680]  Yeah, I really, I feel the same way.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:15.760]  I kind of feel like, so the whole idea
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:17.920]  of a system on a chip was a new idea
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.560]  like 10 years ago or 10 plus years ago.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.060]  And it was easier to conceptualize as a lay person,
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:26.380]  which I would even, I'd certainly consider myself
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:27.600]  when it comes to chip design
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.760]  and hardware system architecture.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.200]  But you can just kind of understand.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.760]  It's like, oh, you put what used to be
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.640]  a bunch of separate components on our motherboard
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.960]  all on one chip, and because it's all on the same piece
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.800]  of silicon, they can talk to each other faster
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.040]  and it's more efficient, and we can make it a lot smaller
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.320]  and it doesn't get hot, and we can put it
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:46.320]  in a tiny little phone that goes in your pants pocket.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:50.980]  I kind of feel like UMA is that big of a change.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:53.480]  It's just harder to conceptualize
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.120]  because it's the idea of just making a little slide
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.960]  and keynote and drawing a chip and saying,
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:02.520]  here's the CPU and the GPU and the RAM
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.680]  and it's all on a chip.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.180]  The unified memory architecture is that big of a change
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:10.960]  where it's like, no, this memory just belongs to everything.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.140]  And the neural engine, we haven't even mentioned
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.260]  a neural engine, which I think is another
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:20.260]  massive hubristic bet that we're going to expand.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:23.900]  And I know Syracuse always mentions it
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:26.300]  when ATP talks about the chips and stuff like that,
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.420]  and you can't quite go by their slides
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:30.060]  because their slides and a keynote
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:34.700]  are sort of artistic representations of the actual chips,
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.780]  but the neural engine takes up a huge amount of the space.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:40.620]  I mean, it is, and it's-
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:42.720]  Well, it's layered into everything too, right?
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.300]  So the neural engine is not this thing
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:47.300]  that handles specific tasks, whereas that's sort of
[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:50.580]  the way it was marketed and the way it originated, right?
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:52.900]  It's like, hey, if we call specific functions,
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:55.620]  the neural engine's going to help you out, right?
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:58.300]  But, or, you know, initially it was,
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:00.580]  if Apple calls specific functions, right?
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:02.860]  We're using it for this feature or that feature.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:06.460]  And then it was, hey, guys, you can run models on device
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.540]  because the neural engine's open to you now, right?
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.620]  Remember they opened it up.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.060]  But it's beyond that.
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:13.800]  It's actually woven into everything they do now.
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.880]  Like every part of, or not every,
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:18.620]  I should, that's an absolutist term, right?
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:21.340]  But many parts, many, many parts,
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:25.700]  and more every day, every iOS release of iOS
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:29.340]  are tied into the neural engine or assisted by it.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:34.340]  So it's a sort of springboard, steroid shot, whatever,
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:37.660]  to the performance levels and more importantly,
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:42.380]  the efficiency levels of many frameworks in iOS now,
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.740]  whereas originally sort of, hey, it's for this thing, right?
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:46.100]  Or these two things.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:49.020]  And I think that's where the neural engine is important.
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:51.300]  And that's why it's such a focus for them
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:55.500]  is because they can get additive benefits across the system
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:59.380]  from one, you know, from working on one particular component
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:01.540]  and improving that one component.
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:06.260]  Because there are more and more and more tasks in computing
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:11.020]  that really rely on this sort of ML framework system, right?
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:15.020]  This, just look at the progressively generated maps, right?
[02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:18.780]  In Mac OS or in iOS now.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:20.300]  That's all ML, you know?
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:25.300]  And like the tasks that can be utilized for this
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.020]  are going to proliferate throughout all of computing.
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.660]  I remember, you know, a couple of years ago,
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:34.620]  it was like a big, like, wow, really?
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:36.740]  When like Mike Matta started up that, you know,
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.060]  little ML startup that he did, right?
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.280]  It's like, hey, you know, anybody can run models
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.460]  and build models quickly.
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.300]  And it got snapped up.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.860]  It got acquired really quickly, right?
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:46.500]  Because, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:47.740]  Because it's huge.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:48.660]  And I mean, you know, Mike,
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:50.540]  just like many other people in computing,
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:54.660]  saw the future of ML as like a tool
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:56.100]  that is woven into everything.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:57.820]  It'd be like, if somebody is like,
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:04:59.660]  hey, I came out with this new spatula.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:02.280]  And you're like, oh, I could use this spatula to, you know,
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.120]  to walk my dog.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.220]  And I can use this spatula to, you know,
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.400]  to take off paint and I can use it to cook.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.320]  And it works for everything.
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.700]  You know, it really is a universal tool.
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.500]  And that, I think, is why the neural engine
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:16.780]  is so additive to all of their systems.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:19.180]  Yeah, Lobe was the name of the startup.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.380]  Yeah, Lobe, Lobe.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:22.460]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:24.760]  We could tie a bow on this episode.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:26.620]  Thanks for being here.
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.460]  Oh yeah, my pleasure.
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:28.620]  Have a good rest of your summer.
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:30.440]  Enjoy your pizzas.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.340]  Yeah, will do.
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:32.180]  And now I'm hungry.
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:34.020]  I'm gonna experiment.
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:37.620]  And of course, everybody can find you at TechCrunch
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:42.380]  where you head up a crew of terrific writers.
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:47.020]  And of course, on Twitter, you're at Panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R,
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:51.080]  even though your last name is Panzerino, but I get it.
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:51.920]  I get it.
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:52.740]  That's how it's pronounced.
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.400]  Thanks for being here.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:58.460]  Let me thank our sponsors, our sponsors this episode.
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.820]  Let's see if I can do it from my head.
[02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.380]  We had Linode Cloud Computing.
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:06.180]  We had Squarespace where consumers can host their websites
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:07.700]  and design them from scratch.
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.780]  We had...
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:14.620]  Already forgetting the earlier ones.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:15.460]  Let me see.
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:16.280]  Oh, I had to cheat.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:17.120]  I had to look.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:17.960]  HelloFresh.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:20.980]  Oh, get those groceries delivered right to your home.
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:24.420]  And of course, Membrful where you can set up your own,
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:28.060]  monetize your online presence with membership system.
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:38.060]  Thanks.
