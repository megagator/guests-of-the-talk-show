[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  All right, we got to move there's a there's an emergency scheduled episode of the talk show Matthew panzer
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.400]  You know is kind enough to shuffle a schedule
[00:08.480 --> 00:15.800]  We're recording on Wednesday night. We got a baseball game coming up big important wild card game with the Giants and the Mets
[00:16.760 --> 00:21.520]  I've got travel plans this weekend that have been rescheduled because there's apparently a hurricane
[00:21.960 --> 00:28.120]  that is coming towards the United States and so we could either record a short episode right now short for the talk show or
[00:28.120 --> 00:35.020]  Probably no episode until next week. So anybody who looks at the time on this and says wow, that's too short
[00:35.020 --> 00:37.020]  well, it's better than nothing and
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.060]  For those of you who've been begging for shorter episodes of the show. Here you go. It's a gift just for you
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.780]  You're welcome. Thank the wild card. Yeah race. Yeah. All right. I'm not a Giants fan, but my family is yeah
[00:49.900 --> 00:54.940]  You gotta watch. Yep, and it's a West Coast team, you know, it's the hometown team. So you gotta watch anyway
[00:54.940 --> 00:59.220]  I tell people this I'm sure you know this because I also know you're a uniform nerd
[01:00.100 --> 01:05.660]  Mm-hmm. I tell people this and it blows people's minds even baseball fans that the Mets
[01:06.180 --> 01:11.580]  The the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants left New York within like a year of each other
[01:11.580 --> 01:15.700]  I think it was like I don't know 1959 or 60 and it left New York
[01:15.700 --> 01:18.860]  Which used to have two National League teams with no National League teams
[01:18.860 --> 01:20.780]  And so they created the Mets
[01:20.780 --> 01:25.000]  To fill the void left behind by both teams and because it was two teams
[01:25.100 --> 01:28.860]  the Mets colors are Dodger blue and Giants orange and
[01:29.140 --> 01:34.180]  I tell people this and they're they're like no they're not and then they go look at the Mets uniforms and they're like, oh
[01:35.500 --> 01:40.860]  Well, that's weird and I'm like and don't you think it's a little weird don't you think it's a little weird that those colors?
[01:40.860 --> 01:42.860]  Don't really go that well
[01:44.640 --> 01:47.060]  Yeah, that one was a crime of expediency
[01:47.060 --> 01:50.820]  There was no there was no careful designer behind that one. I don't think
[01:52.980 --> 01:57.060]  And it's you know, the other color for the Dodgers are the Giants at least is black
[01:57.060 --> 01:59.340]  Which doesn't really you can't really mix with anything
[01:59.340 --> 02:04.360]  So it was really the you know, as long as you were gonna go with this idea, which was a sketchy idea
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.500]  I think in the first place, but there you go
[02:07.300 --> 02:09.700]  And this is it's like not the same colors
[02:09.700 --> 02:16.140]  But it reminds me of the the mellow yellow car in Days of Thunder because those colors are so awful
[02:16.140 --> 02:21.220]  But it's just like it reminds me of a color scheme that would be on a NASCAR car
[02:21.220 --> 02:27.580]  Like, you know, we're like a late late 90s NASCAR car, you know, they're like they're more sedate these days
[02:27.620 --> 02:29.620]  Yeah, who do you like in a game tonight?
[02:30.060 --> 02:35.900]  I think that you know, I think the Jonathan pull it out. They tend to they tend to somehow by hook or crook
[02:35.900 --> 02:41.240]  They tend to like react better under pressure and come through and you know, I never count bum Garner out, you know
[02:41.240 --> 02:46.060]  Bummy's just an amazing pitcher and he said he's a beast so cinder guard him out
[02:46.260 --> 02:49.460]  Cinder guard for pitching for the Mets is one of the best pitchers in baseball
[02:49.460 --> 02:52.140]  You can't go wrong with him the Mets have got to like their chances
[02:52.460 --> 02:58.060]  But I think right now given the last three four years of baseball in a big game
[02:58.060 --> 03:02.420]  I don't think anybody's better in bum car. I mean the record. Yeah, it's crazy
[03:02.420 --> 03:08.980]  I mean the the World Series their last World Series win was just insane, you know when yeah, like no just it's as cool
[03:08.980 --> 03:13.100]  I'll be back in I'll do it. It was as close the one day one two years ago
[03:13.100 --> 03:19.420]  It was about as close as you can get to it to a single person a one-man winning the World Series for his team
[03:20.060 --> 03:23.260]  It's it's really that's you know, there's no other way to put it. I
[03:24.420 --> 03:26.460]  Really? Hope the Giants lose at some point though
[03:26.460 --> 03:33.020]  Cuz I if they win the goddamn World Series again and that this every other year they've what they would have won it in
[03:33.460 --> 03:38.100]  Yeah, every other year 12 12. No, no 10 10 12
[03:38.100 --> 03:44.500]  14 16. Yeah. Yes. Sorry. Yeah, 10 12 14 16, right, right and then you know, they're gonna finish the last place next
[03:44.500 --> 03:51.060]  Yeah, exactly. They're gonna be insufferable too, you know, like all of the fans of the insufferable. I mean I
[03:51.620 --> 03:53.700]  Look, hey, I love the Warriors, you know
[03:53.700 --> 03:56.280]  I love Steph Curry and I wish they would have won
[03:56.340 --> 04:00.840]  But I'm almost kind of glad he didn't win because if they won in the Giants one in the same year
[04:00.840 --> 04:01.900]  It would just be impossible
[04:01.900 --> 04:05.880]  I it just be impossible and they did take it to
[04:05.880 --> 04:09.240]  Unsufferable levels because there was a story I forget who published it
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.320]  It might have been business week, but I don't know something wasn't even a sports publication
[04:13.320 --> 04:19.640]  but somebody had a piece on the on the Warriors while they were still months away from the playoffs about how
[04:20.160 --> 04:27.300]  Silicon Valley geniuses have have you know beaten the NBA at its own game and created an unbeatable team and it's like
[04:27.760 --> 04:29.760]  Take it easy guys
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.880]  Yeah, that was so that was a pretty remarkable piece of
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.880]  PR placement I was I was pretty staggered by that
[04:39.680 --> 04:42.040]  One thing and I you know, you're a Yankees fan, too
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.160]  I think one thing all Yankees fans can agree on is that we do not like insufferable fans
[04:47.480 --> 04:54.800]  Gloat over championships, right? Because we're so humble and salt of the earth exact card calling card for sure exactly
[04:56.540 --> 04:58.340]  Who else you like in the baseball playoffs
[04:58.340 --> 05:03.120]  I I gotta say I'm gonna go with the obvious answers and it really I'll pick first if you don't mind
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.720]  I'm gonna say Cubs and I'm I really hate to say the following two words Red Sox
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.180]  Red Sox. Mmm, but then I hope the Cubs beat the Red Sox. I that would to me would be delicious
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.120]  Right. Yeah
[05:19.240 --> 05:21.880]  Yeah, that would be I mean the Cubs, you know, I
[05:23.080 --> 05:24.920]  Don't know. I
[05:24.920 --> 05:25.480]  Don't know
[05:25.480 --> 05:30.520]  I mean, I think the Red Sox is probably my number one pick and I would really detest it at the Dodgers one
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.960]  But they've been playing so incredibly well aside from these last three games, which the Giants just destroyed them. Yeah
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.840]  But yeah, I mean, I think I think we could see either one of those
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.320]  I think that when I watched him because I was watching to see the Vin Scully
[05:44.240 --> 05:46.580]  Telecasts and it just looked to me like the Dodgers
[05:46.580 --> 05:50.040]  I know they were still fighting for for you know home field and stuff like that there
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.040]  It wasn't like the games didn't matter
[05:52.040 --> 05:56.840]  But they had already once they'd locked up that they were gonna be the you know
[05:56.840 --> 06:00.080]  The middle stay weren't gonna catch the Cubs so they weren't gonna get to play the wild card team
[06:00.080 --> 06:03.820]  And I feel like home field wasn't enough to really fire him up. They played flat
[06:04.640 --> 06:09.240]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. I mean it was it was kind of you know, bittersweet, too
[06:09.240 --> 06:14.320]  I mean you have Vin Scully coming in, you know, doing calling those games those last games in San Francisco
[06:14.320 --> 06:17.680]  It was so it was so cool to see and it was just like hey, man
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.520]  You know win one first win one for Vin, but I guess not
[06:21.120 --> 06:24.800]  Well, and they got it on the the last Dodger game, you know what I mean?
[06:24.800 --> 06:27.080]  Like yeah, I mean the last home game for the Dodgers
[06:27.080 --> 06:32.060]  So the last home game for the Dodgers was one with a dramatic walk off home run that Scully got to call
[06:32.060 --> 06:34.060]  Yeah, that's true. So I feel like
[06:34.200 --> 06:36.920]  Yeah, it's his park. Yeah. Yeah, they got that. Yeah
[06:38.480 --> 06:45.680]  Anyway as we speak literally whether the start of this podcast was the the last holdup was big breaking news
[06:46.600 --> 06:48.600]  by you
[06:48.680 --> 06:49.880]  Yeah
[06:49.880 --> 06:53.740]  Yeah, so Samsung acquired viv which is the company
[06:53.740 --> 07:00.460]  Created by or founded by dad kit louse Adam chair and Chris Brigham who all worked on?
[07:00.900 --> 07:03.620]  Siri, which was acquired by Apple in 2010
[07:03.620 --> 07:10.340]  So they create they left in 2012 well over the years several of them left, but dog left in 2012
[07:10.980 --> 07:12.980]  founded
[07:13.460 --> 07:20.700]  Viv which is a next-gen AI and then worked on that for several years and has just sold it to Samsung
[07:20.700 --> 07:28.220]  Which is I think is sort of they were either I hate to say it
[07:28.220 --> 07:30.100]  I'm not gonna say that they were built to be sold
[07:30.100 --> 07:33.860]  But I think it is the now we can get to Google's announcements
[07:33.860 --> 07:39.500]  We will get to Google's announcements later in the show, but I feel like these sort of AI
[07:41.020 --> 07:43.020]  Systems assistant systems
[07:43.460 --> 07:47.140]  Are fundamentally have to be built into the devices
[07:47.140 --> 07:51.500]  You can't just be an app right and and right as a standalone company
[07:51.500 --> 07:53.980]  That's what Viv would have been is, you know
[07:53.980 --> 07:57.780]  You have to launch the Viv app and then do your stuff and you could there's some cool, you know
[07:57.780 --> 07:59.780]  that's how Siri started to but
[08:00.520 --> 08:06.040]  Everybody is moving in the direction of integrating these things into a system level so that you can address that
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.420]  You know, whether it's so you can say to the device. Hey dingus, you know, I'm you know, go get me an uber
[08:11.420 --> 08:17.140]  Whatever that the baby or to just have access to a button like the way that the new Google Assistant
[08:17.540 --> 08:21.460]  Works with a long press on the home button and the same way that Siri works, etc
[08:22.260 --> 08:23.540]  right
[08:23.540 --> 08:28.640]  Yeah, I'm gonna think with Viv. I talked to dog quite a bit. You know, we I interviewed him in
[08:30.100 --> 08:36.420]  May at our conference in New York and I had talked to him a little bit previously obviously in the run-up and you know
[08:36.420 --> 08:38.100]  kind of get the feel for
[08:38.100 --> 08:42.700]  What to talk about on stage and their their philosophy and he said some of this on stage, too
[08:42.700 --> 08:47.180]  It's not like private information or anything, but he said that they want to you know
[08:47.180 --> 08:51.540]  They wanted to launch the app as a sort of proof of concept, right?
[08:51.580 --> 08:57.860]  But that their vision was the Viv button in every app next to every search bar, etc
[08:57.860 --> 09:04.820]  Etc. And I you know at the time and I told him this, you know, that's like incredibly optimistic right because everybody is sort of in
[09:04.820 --> 09:08.460]  in introducing their own systems of this type
[09:09.260 --> 09:15.460]  Specifically because they don't want to be disintermediated by you know, somebody else's system, right Apple in you know
[09:15.460 --> 09:21.580]  Introduce Siri for a variety of reasons, but one of those reasons is you go to Google less with it, right?
[09:21.580 --> 09:27.960]  You go to you go out to some competitors product less with it and the with Apple
[09:27.960 --> 09:29.140]  It's a little different equation
[09:29.140 --> 09:29.480]  You know
[09:29.480 --> 09:34.180]  You're slicing in the pie a little different because it doesn't necessarily make its money when you do a Google search and click on an ad
[09:34.180 --> 09:42.040]  Right, but it it does compete with device makers like Samsung and other folks who are trying to you know
[09:42.040 --> 09:44.460]  carve out a piece of people's
[09:45.580 --> 09:52.280]  Life, you know and lock them into a system that says look I know so much about you
[09:52.420 --> 09:54.420]  I I know
[09:54.460 --> 10:00.520]  All of these things that I need to know to serve you well and to do the things you want me to do with efficiency
[10:00.520 --> 10:02.500]  Why would you ever leave? Why would you ever go?
[10:02.500 --> 10:04.380]  You know, why did why do you want to do that?
[10:04.380 --> 10:08.020]  And I think that that is like an insurmountable or will be insurmountable
[10:08.620 --> 10:13.140]  Very very soon as far as you know customer lock-in and like a third entrant into the system
[10:13.140 --> 10:16.020]  So honestly, this is a good time for them
[10:16.020 --> 10:22.260]  I mean, he said this is about ubiquity because Samsung has you know, 500 million devices or whatever which you know
[10:22.260 --> 10:24.760]  That's a fair statement. Like if you want to be ubiquitous
[10:25.540 --> 10:29.540]  What are you gonna do? Who are you gonna go to? There's only four companies and three of them have their own already
[10:29.540 --> 10:32.940]  You know, I mean, yep, and you know, yeah
[10:32.940 --> 10:39.580]  I I think it was destined to be acquired by somebody whether it would be Apple or Google or Amazon or
[10:39.900 --> 10:46.480]  Microsoft who would buy them to integrate with what they are already working on or someone like Samsung who is the
[10:46.780 --> 10:54.820]  Biggest example I can think of who just had this glaring hole in their own, you know technology that they own that that that plays this game
[10:54.820 --> 11:02.500]  So right, I'm kind of I don't know any I'd never met the guy so but just from my armchair quarterback position across the continent
[11:02.500 --> 11:08.300]  It I'm I think this is huge news, but I'm not the least bit surprised that Samsung bought them
[11:09.940 --> 11:14.940]  Yeah, no not at all, I mean I think it's it's definitely if you were to have asked me a couple of days ago
[11:14.940 --> 11:16.420]  You know who which?
[11:16.420 --> 11:22.260]  Which company would buy viv, you know that like I said, there's only a handful and I was telling this to somebody else
[11:22.260 --> 11:26.660]  And they were like, oh, I don't know, you know if if they're so far along that they couldn't have been helped by viv
[11:26.660 --> 11:34.300]  you know by viv's team and I think that it's true that Amazon or Google or Apple could definitely have have utilized viv's
[11:34.420 --> 11:36.780]  Technology and expertise right because they've got an insane team
[11:37.540 --> 11:40.300]  but at the same time they've already sort of
[11:40.540 --> 11:43.580]  made their bed and now they have to build on top of that bed and
[11:43.900 --> 11:48.420]  This isn't the time to be taking that bed and throwing it out and purchasing a new bed, you know
[11:48.420 --> 11:52.420]  And I think that that is it's a simplistic analogy
[11:52.580 --> 11:58.820]  But AI systems like this that need to be trained and integrated are not like plug-and-play, you know
[11:58.820 --> 12:01.180]  You don't just kind of buy one and then insert it
[12:02.180 --> 12:09.220]  AI as a as a concept is an additive concept so you can sort of pour it into other buckets and it will improve them
[12:09.300 --> 12:17.060]  but if you're looking for like a cross device cross platform solution that sort of you know is your
[12:17.060 --> 12:22.740]  Brain across all of this that recognizes people and their context and serves them
[12:22.940 --> 12:25.300]  That's not something you just buy and go click-click
[12:25.300 --> 12:30.760]  I mean Siri took a long time to integrate and it's still like far from as sophisticated as it could be
[12:31.380 --> 12:36.820]  Or or sophisticated as it is, but Apple has not yet, you know unlocked those capabilities
[12:37.460 --> 12:42.700]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, I just posted I just linked to the article. I literally while we're recording
[12:42.700 --> 12:50.700]  but I linked to the article at TechCrunch and my quick comment is just does anyone disagree that AI assistant technology is
[12:50.900 --> 12:52.900]  table-stakes for the next decade
[12:53.580 --> 12:57.520]  Yeah, I don't know. I think this is one of those rare things where everybody agrees
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.580]  I don't know anybody who disagrees with this, you know, yeah, you got the person is like no, that's stupid
[13:02.580 --> 13:05.200]  Nobody should have one of those right, you know
[13:05.380 --> 13:11.760]  It's just another way for Samsung to sort of assert their independence from Google, you know, right in terms of being
[13:11.760 --> 13:13.760]  a
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.720]  It's just not a good position to be in for them to be completely beholden to Google to provide all of that intelligence
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.400]  Not at all. Not at all. It doesn't make any sense for them and it hasn't made sense for a while
[13:24.600 --> 13:30.240]  Which is why they've been experimenting with he's in and other stuff, but with Samsung they have two options
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.340]  They can sort of try to create a mobile operating system
[13:33.340 --> 13:39.040]  right like try to like do an Android right pull an Android and just like turn and burn and
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.880]  Make a mess of things and go as fast as they can and then have to clean it all up like honestly Android
[13:45.380 --> 13:51.340]  We joked about this Porsche analogy with the whole, you know, the iPhone like cave just refine this Porsche thing
[13:51.340 --> 13:57.620]  but there's sort of another saying about Porsche which is that they made a mistake 50 years ago and I've spent 50 years fixing it and
[13:57.700 --> 14:00.440]  That that mistake was that they made a rear wheel
[14:00.900 --> 14:06.820]  We will drive car with an engine in the back, right? It's like no that doesn't physics
[14:06.820 --> 14:08.820]  Did anybody check the physics?
[14:09.100 --> 14:10.180]  And so, you know
[14:10.180 --> 14:11.060]  They're famously
[14:11.060 --> 14:17.180]  9-elevens are famously squirrelly and hard to drive and have gotten better because they've added traction control and new
[14:17.500 --> 14:22.700]  Suspension and steering assistance and you know better differentials and blah blah blah blah blah, right?
[14:22.900 --> 14:25.700]  but that took them 50 years to get into a space where
[14:25.860 --> 14:30.460]  You can actually take a 9-eleven out and drive it to the storm back and not be afraid you're going to end your life
[14:30.460 --> 14:36.660]  You know and like if if it rains for like three seconds, it's like done. You might as well pull over, you know
[14:36.660 --> 14:37.660]  um
[14:37.660 --> 14:43.820]  But I think that that is an interesting analogy when you look at Android because Android was created out of necessity
[14:43.820 --> 14:44.180]  You know
[14:44.180 --> 14:49.940]  it was sort of created to be one thing and then purchased and then modified for other uses and has been
[14:50.460 --> 14:54.360]  essentially fixed right over the intervening years like patches
[14:55.140 --> 14:58.060]  have been placed on holes and things have been
[14:59.620 --> 15:04.880]  desoldered and taken out and bolt and new things have been bolted on and it's in a shape where you could conceivably say
[15:04.880 --> 15:10.220]  Oh, you know I could pick up an Android phone and use it for pretty much nine-tenths of my tasks or an iPhone and those
[15:10.540 --> 15:15.420]  Differentiating factors are really like the personalization and the customization and an artificial
[15:15.620 --> 15:21.100]  Artificial intelligence is a part of that like does my phone recognize me and everything. I have to know I need to know
[15:21.140 --> 15:25.060]  so if you look at Samsung and you go should Samsung pull an Android and
[15:25.500 --> 15:30.340]  Build an OS from scratch or should it start with the core differentiating factor?
[15:30.340 --> 15:36.500]  Which is the AI and then sort of work outwards from there because it has Android it doesn't really need to build something new
[15:36.780 --> 15:42.180]  Google's like open, you know, you can have all this almost all the stuff except for the Google stuff, right?
[15:42.180 --> 15:49.360]  And that's that's Samsung going. Well, why don't we just build our own quote-unquote Google stuff, right the stuff that
[15:49.780 --> 15:51.060]  Allows people to go
[15:51.060 --> 15:56.300]  Oh, I could pick up my Samsung and just ask it something or I can talk to my fridge and ask it something right?
[15:56.300 --> 16:02.260]  Which is going to be it this is actually works out
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.740]  It almost seems like we've planned this but it actually is a pretty good segue into
[16:06.440 --> 16:08.440]  Google's event which was
[16:08.800 --> 16:11.900]  Yesterday as we record earlier this week that made by Google event
[16:13.140 --> 16:20.100]  But first since we're moving right along. I'm gonna thank our first sponsor is our good friends at fracture
[16:20.100 --> 16:26.240]  Fracture is the company, you know them they print your photos directly on glass. I think
[16:27.260 --> 16:29.260]  There's probably a lot of people
[16:29.820 --> 16:34.500]  That probably think well glass is heavy. So this is like a heavy thing to put on a wall one of the things
[16:34.500 --> 16:40.220]  I don't mention it. I'm stealing this from Marco by the way Marco mentioned this point on on ATP, but I'm stealing it
[16:41.140 --> 16:45.360]  One of the things that makes these fracture prints so remarkable is how lightweight they are
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.140]  They they come they self hanging they call it but everything you need to hang it on
[16:50.140 --> 16:53.880]  The wall is on the back of this piece of glass. So you send them your photos
[16:53.880 --> 16:57.620]  They print them directly on the glass. It looks like it's right on the surface of the glass
[16:58.260 --> 17:02.040]  Edge to edge corner to corner. No frame necessary
[17:02.040 --> 17:06.640]  It's just the glass and then there's just the the thing you need to hang it on the wall
[17:06.640 --> 17:09.860]  You just you know that they don't come to your house and put the nail in the wall
[17:09.860 --> 17:16.340]  But other than that, it's it it hangs itself super lightweight almost like lighter than you'd think it could be
[17:17.300 --> 17:21.580]  Which makes you feel really good hanging it on the wall because you don't feel like hey
[17:21.580 --> 17:26.320]  This is like a big heavy piece of glass. It's gonna break and put broken glass all over the floor or whatever
[17:27.540 --> 17:31.060]  Quality is excellent. I mean these this is how I print photos
[17:31.060 --> 17:34.540]  I don't you know, I can't imagine why I would print them some other way
[17:34.540 --> 17:41.700]  It great quality all sorts of great sizes great price. They are made in a carbon neutral factory
[17:41.700 --> 17:43.700]  Right in beautiful Gainesville, Florida
[17:45.020 --> 17:48.540]  And here's the thing they're up in their their their sponsorships
[17:49.340 --> 17:52.340]  recently September now we're in October because
[17:53.220 --> 17:55.220]  These are fantastic gifts
[17:55.220 --> 18:02.420]  I really are it's it's both they make the people like you're you're you're giving the grandparents give them to other family members stuff like that
[18:02.420 --> 18:04.420]  if you've got kids
[18:05.080 --> 18:10.240]  Get some pictures printed of them give them to everybody for Christmas and the other holidays
[18:10.940 --> 18:14.900]  Great gift for a couple of reasons. It makes the people you give them to really happy. Trust me
[18:14.900 --> 18:20.520]  They love them and it's so easy. It is so easy for you in terms of hey, let's knock off
[18:20.920 --> 18:26.320]  You know all the parents and grandparents and stuff like that knock off the the holiday gift items
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.520]  here's the reason they want you to think about doing that now or soon because
[18:30.520 --> 18:36.160]  These things are all made by hand right here in Florida. Well, I'm not in Florida, but right here in the u.s
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.360]  They get backed up for the holidays is what I'm going to get net
[18:39.360 --> 18:45.160]  So you can't wait till like the beginning of December and then still get it by the end of December for the holidays
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.600]  So think about it. Now, you'll you'll knock off something on your shopping list way early. You'll be ahead of the game
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.280]  Where do you go? You go to fracture me calm. That's our website slash
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.680]  podcast that's the thing to remember that that they're using the same URL for all their podcast ads and then they'll just ask you a
[19:02.680 --> 19:08.240]  one-question survey of where did you hear about it from and that's where you tell them you hear from the talk show and
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.800]  Anyway, you go to that URL. You'll get 10% off your first order
[19:11.800 --> 19:17.400]  So the more pictures you buy on that first order the more you'll save so go to fracture me calm slash podcast
[19:17.400 --> 19:19.400]  My thanks to them
[19:20.160 --> 19:23.400]  So I said segue going to the made by Google event
[19:23.400 --> 19:30.400]  So why you know, why should Samsung be concerned about owning their own technology for the stuff like this because to me this weeks
[19:30.920 --> 19:35.840]  Made by Google event which overall I have to say I was pretty impressed by but the truth is
[19:36.280 --> 19:42.120]  Very obvious that Google is now going to favor their own hardware over those of partners
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.960]  That the full experience that they're planning that they feel like they can drive through AI technology
[19:49.960 --> 19:56.040]  They are they clearly they said so it's not even implicit explicit in interviews this week that they see that the
[19:56.520 --> 19:58.520]  Integrated hardware and software is the way to go
[20:00.440 --> 20:02.440]  Imagine that
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.640]  Surprised no other company had ever come up with this before
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.200]  You know, it's it's remarkable that Google was first to this this realization
[20:14.120 --> 20:16.120]  You know
[20:16.120 --> 20:17.560]  You know
[20:17.560 --> 20:20.440]  I'm not gonna I'm not gonna rag on them too hard, right because it does
[20:21.080 --> 20:24.600]  They made a bed right and they had to lie in it and that that bed
[20:25.400 --> 20:29.240]  was that they had to be partner friendly and
[20:30.040 --> 20:31.800]  Um, you know
[20:31.800 --> 20:34.360]  This this open strategy whatever you want to call it
[20:35.080 --> 20:37.720]  It really laid out a track for them that they had to follow
[20:37.960 --> 20:41.480]  And they followed it for as long as it made sense and now it doesn't make sense anymore
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.760]  the Google is not a fool the people that are not fools, but the people that should have known or
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.560]  Should have realized are the partners, you know, the the companies that are like, oh Google will never betray us
[20:51.720 --> 20:54.920]  And you know, they they will always have our interests at heart, etc
[20:55.240 --> 20:59.320]  I do think Google meant it and I think part I don't think it's any coincidence at all
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.520]  I've mentioned this briefly in a short DF piece the other day
[21:03.720 --> 21:09.800]  Pointing out that you know how like the 2010 in particular was the year where it was where Vic and Dottra was on
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.200]  was on to given a keynote at IO and really dug into
[21:14.760 --> 21:19.320]  the anti iPhone anti Apple anti Steve Jobs sort of uh
[21:20.120 --> 21:22.040]  sentiment
[21:22.040 --> 21:25.240]  You know, it literally said something to the effect of one man
[21:26.120 --> 21:33.480]  One phone one company one carrier is you know, we're we're here to stop that from dominating mobile for the coming decades
[21:33.480 --> 21:41.000]  Uh, and really meant it. I truly think I think vincon dota meant it. I think Andy Rubin was very much along
[21:41.400 --> 21:46.840]  You know on that that it was a strength of Android to be Microsoft to the PC
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.520]  Industry, you know to to to not you know
[21:51.320 --> 21:58.040]  only do like reference hardware and just do the software and I really think that they they thought that they could they they that
[21:58.600 --> 22:01.160]  Android would lead to a Windows like
[22:01.160 --> 22:03.160]  like monopoly over mobile
[22:03.740 --> 22:05.100]  right
[22:05.100 --> 22:10.140]  And they were still they still thought that in 2012, right? I think so. Yeah the galaxy nexus
[22:10.780 --> 22:13.260]  uh the nexus 7 tablet and uh that
[22:14.380 --> 22:19.180]  That streaming device that nexus 6th like orb
[22:19.820 --> 22:23.420]  Uh, I forget what they called it exactly, but it was like the ball thing
[22:23.660 --> 22:24.540]  um
[22:24.540 --> 22:29.660]  I don't know that was that that was that particular google IO when they introduced all those things and and there was like some
[22:29.660 --> 22:36.860]  Additional glass stuff the explorer edition of glass was when that was launched and everything and yeah that particular one
[22:37.180 --> 22:39.900]  they also made a lot of you know, really kind of
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.860]  in you know
[22:43.100 --> 22:45.100]  Whatever you want to call it
[22:45.480 --> 22:47.340]  Predictive or or
[22:47.340 --> 22:50.300]  or hypothetical but not really hypothetical statements about
[22:50.700 --> 22:54.700]  software and hardware integration and how they could only do certain things if they took control of both and
[22:55.020 --> 22:57.180]  And they would show their partners how you know
[22:57.180 --> 23:02.060]  Good, it could be and then they would follow suit and this is when they were dealing they were kind of trying to roll out
[23:02.460 --> 23:04.540]  several small software updates
[23:04.940 --> 23:09.420]  uh to limit fragmentation and all that stuff and in 2012, I I
[23:10.060 --> 23:14.860]  I remember tweeting this because my I remember the first reply was do you realize the stupidity of that tweet?
[23:17.580 --> 23:19.100]  But but the
[23:19.100 --> 23:21.980]  It was really funny because nobody replied to it at the time everybody like
[23:21.980 --> 23:29.020]  Favorited it but nobody replied and then it took a year. I posted it june 27th. Well, what did the tweet say?
[23:29.580 --> 23:35.360]  Well, the tweet was the hardware and software hardware plus software epiphany and I said apple 1979
[23:36.140 --> 23:42.780]  Microsoft 2012 because there's the surface thing and then google 2012 in other words like they're they're saying like oh
[23:43.020 --> 23:49.660]  Maybe the right way to do this is to do both right and to say maybe there are maybe there you could do the other
[23:49.660 --> 23:55.020]  But for I was being a bit facetious because obviously that hardware software
[23:56.220 --> 24:01.500]  joined made less sense for a variety of reasons that have been gone over ad nauseum by you and other folks and
[24:01.980 --> 24:06.060]  All of us over the years made less sense on on desktop than it does on mobile, right?
[24:06.380 --> 24:12.060]  But mobile's lack of tolerance for weirdness and it's it's intimate nature and a lot of other things
[24:12.780 --> 24:17.020]  It just apple had the right formula for it, which is why the iphone was such a hit right off the bat
[24:17.020 --> 24:20.160]  And so microsoft and google in 2012
[24:20.700 --> 24:24.140]  Kind of shifted their gears and we're like, oh, maybe we should
[24:24.860 --> 24:28.540]  Take full control over these mobile experiences because people are not getting them, right?
[24:29.180 --> 24:34.540]  And letting our partners diddle around with our hardware is not going to you know
[24:34.700 --> 24:38.620]  Or our software in microsoft's case is not going to to make a device
[24:39.180 --> 24:44.060]  That's holistically like feels great and and engenders love and loyalty
[24:44.060 --> 24:49.260]  Love and loyalty. Do you think it took them that long though to get to the point where they have these pixels?
[24:49.660 --> 24:50.700]  Do you?
[24:50.700 --> 24:53.660]  Or do you think that there were further epiphanies along the line?
[24:54.940 --> 24:58.140]  I don't know. I mean it that's that's the joke I was making about
[24:58.780 --> 25:04.860]  You know google convincing people that they're launching their own phones for the third time. Yeah, um for the first time because they had
[25:05.420 --> 25:07.580]  You know the google the android
[25:07.580 --> 25:12.620]  The one yeah, yeah, and then they had the nexus phones, of course
[25:12.620 --> 25:16.620]  And then this is sort of like the third time they've done this but it seems
[25:17.180 --> 25:23.020]  For better or for worse. They seem more serious about it now and I think they're serious about it now because they're in a place where
[25:23.660 --> 25:24.700]  their
[25:24.700 --> 25:27.020]  their competitors their real competitors are
[25:28.300 --> 25:32.060]  Are or real partners partner slash competitors are
[25:32.780 --> 25:37.260]  Very seriously thinking about divorcing themselves, right? And so they're like, okay
[25:37.260 --> 25:43.020]  And going like, you know, hey, what do we do when google's not the answer or how do we fork?
[25:43.500 --> 25:49.260]  You know android in a way that's to our advantage like, you know, amazon, uh attempted to do
[25:49.660 --> 25:55.020]  But I think that they basically they look at it and say well eventually it's going to happen and somebody's going to be good at it
[25:55.100 --> 26:00.700]  So why don't we just do it? Why don't we be the person that's good at it? And that's why we're getting this third attempt
[26:01.340 --> 26:02.380]  Yeah
[26:02.380 --> 26:04.380]  um
[26:04.380 --> 26:07.900]  As for the phones themselves, I uh
[26:08.780 --> 26:14.220]  I almost i i've i'm one who's largely offended by rip-offs and I
[26:15.020 --> 26:18.700]  you know over the years have you know argued with people on twitter and
[26:19.420 --> 26:24.380]  You know, I was certainly of of the belief that samsung ripped off the iphone
[26:24.940 --> 26:26.540]  uh
[26:26.540 --> 26:31.900]  In those phones that were the the subject of the big uh case that went to court
[26:32.620 --> 26:33.660]  uh
[26:33.660 --> 26:37.100]  I largely agree with apple on the merits of most of their
[26:37.660 --> 26:42.060]  arguments there and and the counter-argument was always from people who who either I
[26:42.540 --> 26:47.420]  I just think that they're mentally made up not to notice see or notice these things in the way that like
[26:47.980 --> 26:48.940]  for
[26:48.940 --> 26:53.180]  Best example I can think of is the way some people just don't notice the differences between fonts
[26:53.340 --> 26:53.900]  And so yes
[26:53.900 --> 26:59.340]  They can see the difference between like a serif and a sans serif because you can say see these little feet at the bottom
[26:59.340 --> 27:05.020]  That's the serifs and they'll say oh, yeah. Yeah, I see that but they don't see the difference between times and garamond
[27:05.180 --> 27:07.900]  and they don't see the difference even between futura and
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.700]  Helvetica let alone the subtle differences between say helvetica and ariel
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.980]  Uh, which is an actual rip-off font. It's a rip-off
[27:16.620 --> 27:23.740]  Yeah, so I I think that there's people who just don't see the differences like that in industrial design and they give arguments like well
[27:23.820 --> 27:25.820]  there's only so many ways to make a
[27:25.820 --> 27:29.260]  uh round cornered round rectangular piece of glass
[27:29.900 --> 27:31.900]  And it's like, uh, no
[27:32.380 --> 27:34.380]  That's not true
[27:35.020 --> 27:41.100]  Yeah, yeah, I think it's like trying to tell somebody who's colorblind like this is lavender and they're all no it's not you're all
[27:41.260 --> 27:46.700]  Okay, never mind because they just don't will never see it. These these pixel phones are so clearly
[27:48.300 --> 27:50.540]  Following the design of the iphone 6
[27:50.540 --> 27:55.260]  That it I mean it's to a degree that I don't think i've ever seen in any phone
[27:55.660 --> 27:58.940]  Any post iphone competing phone ever. These are the biggest
[27:59.820 --> 28:02.860]  rip-offs of the iphone industrial design ever
[28:03.740 --> 28:10.700]  But there's it's almost so absurd that I almost salute them for it's almost like there's a certain integrity to it where they're just
[28:11.100 --> 28:15.980]  Explicitly saying yes, we're making phones that make look like iphones. They're not I don't even think they're quite denying it
[28:15.980 --> 28:21.420]  I mean, they're even talking about it in some of the articles that they've made a few choices to not make them look like iphones
[28:21.740 --> 28:26.540]  but nobody there's so much like iphones in terms of the the the
[28:27.420 --> 28:30.380]  The shape just the basic shape that it
[28:31.180 --> 28:36.540]  I don't see how anybody could look at them and first thought not be wow. Those look exactly like the iphone 6
[28:37.180 --> 28:41.580]  Right. There's almost an integrity to the fact that they are if we're going to copy apple. We might as well copy apple
[28:41.580 --> 28:46.140]  Yeah, uh, yeah, it's like, you know recently instagram copied snapchat with their stories thing
[28:46.140 --> 28:50.140]  Yes, and and they basically said yeah snapchat came up with a really good idea
[28:50.140 --> 28:52.780]  So this is our spin on it which I think is like, you know
[28:52.780 --> 28:58.300]  facebook has copied a lot of features from snapchat over the years or tried to and most of those standalone apps have failed but
[28:58.780 --> 29:04.860]  Instagrams, you know, even though it's under the facebook umbrella, it's led by you know, people who will make decisions and in this case
[29:04.860 --> 29:09.260]  They either made the decision or convinced somebody above them to allow them to say
[29:09.260 --> 29:12.300]  Look, we thought it was great. So this is our spin on it
[29:12.300 --> 29:18.300]  And I think that's the kind of a there's a similar scenario going on here where they may not explicitly say it because google probably has
[29:18.300 --> 29:25.340]  A little bit more, you know layers of interruption between somebody just coming out and saying that and not but I do think that it
[29:25.980 --> 29:27.980]  There is an element of
[29:28.860 --> 29:31.500]  The design is great. We're just going to use that
[29:32.220 --> 29:36.940]  Because the design is not really all that important to us in terms of in terms of accountability
[29:36.940 --> 29:43.260]  Right, and i'm using design here in the terminology of you know, physical industrial design physical appearance
[29:43.260 --> 29:46.220]  Not the holistic design capital d
[29:46.940 --> 29:50.940]  Where it's the way it works and looks but I think that they said, you know, hey, there's certain choices
[29:50.940 --> 29:57.420]  We need to make but one of those choices is not to be wildly different, you know to wildly differentiate the look and feel
[29:57.980 --> 30:03.980]  And I the way I feel about it is the name of the phone is perfect because it's called pixel
[30:03.980 --> 30:09.500]  Which obviously to anybody, you know in the computer world or honestly most people
[30:10.140 --> 30:15.580]  Probably know at least what a pixel is because nine times out of ten when you tell anybody about like a phone or something
[30:15.580 --> 30:20.460]  Oh, how many pixels does it have right like they don't really know or you know, how many pixels that camera have?
[30:20.460 --> 30:25.980]  They don't they don't really know what it means and how that translates, you know from a capture element to an actual pixel on a screen
[30:25.980 --> 30:27.980]  Well pixel is like a really broad
[30:27.980 --> 30:34.080]  Recognizable term so a one, you know, number one broad recognizable term. So that's great, right? That's a good choice
[30:34.640 --> 30:40.960]  And second is it emphasizes what's on the screen right the software and to google
[30:40.960 --> 30:47.040]  the hardware is a vehicle for their ai and whatever other software they want to launch on it and
[30:47.440 --> 30:51.520]  To apple the hardware is the thing and then people build to suit the hardware
[30:51.840 --> 30:54.080]  Like that's the way that they that's their philosophy
[30:54.080 --> 31:00.640]  Their entire developer ecosystem builds to the precise specifications available on the devices and that's what leads to you know
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.200]  Theoretically great experiences but google is basically like hey
[31:05.520 --> 31:11.840]  We can provide all the experiences people need or that we really care about and so the pixel calling it pixel
[31:11.840 --> 31:17.840]  Telegraphs that it says it's about what's on the screen. It's not about what's around the screen, you know
[31:17.840 --> 31:19.440]  Don't worry too much about that
[31:19.440 --> 31:25.200]  We're gonna give you a design that you that feels familiar that you feel like oh I could that's a phone I could use that
[31:25.200 --> 31:28.880]  Thing, you know, and that's it. They're good. They're golden. The rest of it is on the screen
[31:30.400 --> 31:36.400]  Here's my biggest question that and I you know, it's a win for them honestly
[31:36.400 --> 31:42.480]  It's it doesn't have a camera bump and that was one of the first things I noticed one of the things that they copied though
[31:42.480 --> 31:46.080]  Is they put the camera in the same corner that the iPhone is on the screen?
[31:46.080 --> 31:50.320]  Though is they put the camera in the same corner that the iPhone has always put the camera
[31:50.640 --> 31:54.320]  And that's been one of the weird things that i've always wondered about that here we are
[31:54.560 --> 31:57.360]  You know nine years with ten generations of the iPhone
[31:57.680 --> 32:03.520]  And every single one has had the camera in the top left as you look at the back face of the camera
[32:04.400 --> 32:07.840]  and almost all competing phones put the camera in the
[32:08.640 --> 32:11.360]  In the center more or less where the apple logo goes on an iPhone
[32:11.360 --> 32:19.360]  And where the pixels put their fingernail fingerprint sensor most other phones though put the cameras there whether there's a bump whether there's no bump
[32:20.240 --> 32:26.240]  I've never quite understood why since you know, just not even making the argument of why the iphone's placement is better
[32:26.240 --> 32:29.520]  But given that the iphone oh it is for sure. I think so, too
[32:29.520 --> 32:33.360]  Because I think it it keeps it's more likely to keep your finger out of the position
[32:33.360 --> 32:37.040]  Most people are right-handed and you bring up the phone and most people are going to take in a horizontal
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.960]  And so you bring up the phone and turn it horizontal and you tap it with your right thumb
[32:40.960 --> 32:43.680]  And your your other finger is in front of it holding it stable
[32:43.920 --> 32:47.040]  And then that way you don't have a finger in front of the lens. It makes total damn sense
[32:47.040 --> 32:49.520]  It's like the right place to put the camera and android phones
[32:49.520 --> 32:52.480]  It's all I always have my damn finger in front of the camera and I have to remove it
[32:52.480 --> 32:56.640]  I do too and I don't know if it's because I have a uh, I have finger, you know
[32:56.640 --> 32:59.440]  Handheld habits that that coincide with it or not
[33:01.040 --> 33:03.040]  I'm looking at my moto
[33:03.040 --> 33:08.240]  X right here and I just remember i've i've often i'd hold it up and my fingers right over the camera
[33:08.240 --> 33:13.280]  Yeah, well the nexus 5 is in the center. So they sort of like that. Hey, we'll be agnostic
[33:13.280 --> 33:18.480]  You know left hand right hand here here was my first question though as soon as I saw the design and this is before
[33:18.480 --> 33:21.360]  You know before the event because it leaked and I was like, well, there's no camera bump
[33:21.360 --> 33:25.760]  So, how are they not having a camera bump? Is it because they made the phone thicker there?
[33:25.760 --> 33:31.200]  Is it that they've got the somehow they've got superior optics? So the iphone
[33:31.200 --> 33:33.200]  seven is
[33:35.360 --> 33:42.960]  Have it right here in front of me seven point one millimeters thick and the seven plus is seven point three millimeters thick
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.720]  So two-tenths of one millimeter thicker for the plus than the regular seven and then there's a big bump
[33:49.600 --> 33:52.720]  the pixels dimensions on google's tech specs page
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.600]  are
[33:56.320 --> 33:58.480]  For thickness, I don't understand what this means
[33:58.480 --> 34:06.080]  seven point three and then a tilde eight point five millimeters and that's for both phones the pixel and the pixel xl
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.800]  It's eight point five at the top because there's a plate of glass or whatever that is and I think so
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.280]  I I I don't know. I haven't seen anybody answer this though. I think that they're slightly wedge shaped sort of like, uh,
[34:17.280 --> 34:23.920]  You know it not quite to the to the narrow to like a blade like a macbook air but that they're they're not
[34:23.920 --> 34:29.600]  When you look at it in profile from the side, it doesn't look like the bottom is as thick as the top
[34:29.600 --> 34:36.240]  It's thinner at the bottom than it is at the top. So it's sort of like they slope the whole phone up to where it would be
[34:36.240 --> 34:37.920]  a bump
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.640]  Right. Yes that I I totally agree. I think that's what happened there. I I actually didn't go to the event
[34:42.880 --> 34:44.240]  So I didn't handle them myself
[34:44.240 --> 34:49.760]  but I I did ask somebody and I believe that's what they told me there was that sort of like piece of the of
[34:49.760 --> 34:55.040]  Material at the top. I hesitate to just say glass because I don't want to be wrong. I don't think that it's just but it doesn't like
[34:55.040 --> 35:01.840]  Jump in thickness. I think it is. It's like a gentle wedge shape but and and their product photography bevel though
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.240]  Their product photography seems to purposefully obscure that
[35:07.200 --> 35:13.760]  It it my I looked at product photography for a while before I even thought to suspect that you know
[35:13.760 --> 35:19.360]  Yeah, I actually went in our back end here. Uh, because our our guys were at the event
[35:19.760 --> 35:23.520]  We generally when we shoot pictures we dump them all into the back end. So people that are
[35:24.160 --> 35:30.400]  Utilizing them or writing articles about them can pull them up. And so let me i'm pulling one up here
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.760]  Yeah, and he's holding it at an angle and you can clearly see that that part at the top is raised
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.440]  Yeah, now whether it's like a wedge from the top or a wedge from the bottom
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.320]  You can clearly see that that part at the top is raised. Yeah. Now whether it's like a wedge from you know
[35:45.600 --> 35:50.880]  Two-thirds up the phone it starts out at like, you know, eight millimeters and then it goes up to 8.3 at the very top
[35:50.960 --> 35:54.640]  I don't know, but it's definitely like it raised at the top
[35:54.880 --> 35:58.160]  The top third of the phone is raised off of the the rest of the phone
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.120]  so I think they're hiding a lot of the bump in there and if you look at the camera, it's interesting because they
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.520]  There's actually a sort of slight
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.220]  Indention it slopes inwards at the camera. Yeah
[36:09.940 --> 36:11.940]  So, I don't know. I think it's a combination of things
[36:11.940 --> 36:16.580]  I think they found out, you know, they figured out a way to make it as thin as possible and then they also
[36:17.300 --> 36:21.060]  Sloped it up a little bit. But yeah, it's a clever clever way to get rid of the bump for sure
[36:21.380 --> 36:26.740]  Yeah, and it will you know, it certainly would allow it to still sit flat on the table with no wobble
[36:27.540 --> 36:32.340]  So I have to say I mean i'm not willing to say that it's a complete win without seeing it myself
[36:32.340 --> 36:35.860]  I mean, I think i'm gonna buy one because I haven't bought an android phone in a while
[36:35.860 --> 36:37.860]  And it seems like this would be the one to buy
[36:38.100 --> 36:40.100]  Yeah, I think i'm gonna upgrade from my 5x to yeah
[36:40.420 --> 36:46.020]  Um, so I don't know but it's you know, I I still hate the bumps. I like the I like the seven bump better
[36:46.100 --> 36:51.060]  I've said this before I like the seven bump better than the six and six s bump because to me it's more of an honest bump
[36:51.300 --> 36:55.780]  It's like yeah, man, we've got it. We yeah, we definitely have a bump and you see it in a product photography
[36:55.940 --> 37:00.580]  Like this badass camera in here and apple there were entire articles two years ago about
[37:00.580 --> 37:04.020]  about how apple's product photography hid the bump and
[37:04.580 --> 37:11.460]  Yeah, they had profile pictures where in theory you think you would have been able to see the bump and you didn't and then there were
[37:11.780 --> 37:16.260]  You know defenses where people were making their own photos and they're like if you hold it just right you can take
[37:16.580 --> 37:19.060]  a real photo and not show the bump by
[37:19.620 --> 37:24.900]  You know just the exact shooting it from the opposite side and you know putting it at the exact right angle
[37:25.380 --> 37:29.220]  And I can just hold up my phone to my eye and hold it sideways and if I hold it just right
[37:29.220 --> 37:32.820]  It looks like it's in perfect profile and I don't see the bump but i'm doing it
[37:32.900 --> 37:39.940]  It was dishonest. Whereas now apple's product photography highlights the bump. They've got like a beautiful reflection off the jet black
[37:40.500 --> 37:42.100]  You know aluminum
[37:42.100 --> 37:44.500]  Right, and then the reflection is not an accident
[37:45.300 --> 37:46.180]  right
[37:46.180 --> 37:50.980]  You know, so, you know, i'm not willing but you know overall I think not having a bump
[37:50.980 --> 37:56.100]  You've got to say if you know, otherwise it fit, you know fits doesn't feel too thick in your hand, etc
[37:56.100 --> 37:58.740]  This could be a win for the pixel over the iphone
[37:59.620 --> 38:04.100]  Yeah, I mean hey who who wants I mean, nobody wants a bump that bump probably just drives
[38:04.580 --> 38:09.060]  Johnny insane, right? All right, but it's you know, you got to do what you got to do
[38:09.220 --> 38:14.260]  I think having an asymmetrical overall the whole phone being asymmetric would drive him nuts, too, though
[38:15.700 --> 38:20.500]  Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's like I can still see why I could I could I wouldn't be you know
[38:20.500 --> 38:26.500]  I'd almost be surprised if apple didn't consider a wedge shape design to accommodate the uh
[38:27.540 --> 38:32.580]  You know the necessary thickness of the camera unit and I could see why apple rejected it
[38:33.380 --> 38:35.540]  I remember that wedge shape design that
[38:36.180 --> 38:39.860]  Who said that was going to have a was it josh polsky or somebody like yeah, I think so
[38:39.860 --> 38:42.180]  This is my next or something. They said it was going to be like a wedge
[38:42.740 --> 38:48.180]  So maybe they were considering a wedge at some point, right? Like maybe that wasn't totally, you know, pulled out of thin air
[38:48.180 --> 38:53.380]  Thin air, right? Maybe that wasn't I wouldn't be surprised at all, but I can also see why they got rid of you know
[38:53.540 --> 38:55.140]  Didn't go that way
[38:55.140 --> 38:56.180]  sure
[38:56.180 --> 38:57.860]  um
[38:57.860 --> 39:02.660]  What else about these phones they did move they moved the volume to the other side
[39:04.180 --> 39:06.820]  Yes, which is where a lot of android phones have had the volume
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.060]  Right, right
[39:09.060 --> 39:12.660]  Uh, yeah, I mean I like I mean look I like them. I mean, I think that they're a little bit
[39:13.220 --> 39:15.780]  Awkward the mix of materials is not really my bag, you know
[39:15.780 --> 39:21.220]  Um, like the two-tone thing. Yeah, it's it just seems a little bit contrived to me
[39:21.620 --> 39:24.020]  And I don't know why they have antenna
[39:25.460 --> 39:26.660]  lines
[39:26.660 --> 39:27.620]  and
[39:27.620 --> 39:29.940]  a huge window that could theoretically be
[39:31.060 --> 39:33.060]  transparent to signal but
[39:33.620 --> 39:40.820]  That's you know, i'm not a phone designer. So there's probably like very logical reasons and all of that stuff, you know, right and it like
[39:41.780 --> 39:43.780]  the iphone 4 and 4s had
[39:43.780 --> 39:51.060]  Breaks, you know, the antenna was the frame around the sides and then there famously there were breaks in there for different antennas
[39:51.220 --> 39:53.060]  To not be touching each other
[39:53.060 --> 39:58.340]  But then the back was made out of glass and therefore signals get through I don't quite get why they've got
[39:58.740 --> 40:03.460]  A one-third glass back and two-thirds aluminum and antenna lines
[40:04.340 --> 40:07.380]  I could see why they have glass if they wanted to have the antenna signals get through
[40:07.860 --> 40:12.820]  And I could see having antenna lines for the reasons that the iphone 6 and 7 have antenna lines, but I don't see both
[40:12.820 --> 40:14.820]  I don't see both
[40:15.780 --> 40:22.100]  Yeah, it'll be curious it's a very technical design right yeah like it screams like this is very technical
[40:22.180 --> 40:25.700]  We have lots of things going on and I think that's that's an interesting
[40:26.260 --> 40:27.540]  um
[40:27.540 --> 40:33.140]  Play and they probably did it intentionally right because this is this is the high high end of the android market
[40:33.140 --> 40:35.620]  Which is something we haven't talked about yet, but pricing wise
[40:36.340 --> 40:42.500]  This is an expensive phone, right? This is not like the nexus 5x. Hey get one for 250 bucks flat out
[40:42.500 --> 40:48.180]  You know or whatever on sale or with a coupon, you know, this is these are expensive 650 to 800
[40:48.980 --> 40:54.500]  950 phones or whatever. Yeah, they're very comparably priced to the iphone 7
[40:56.580 --> 41:00.340]  It's 120 more for the for the bigger display
[41:01.220 --> 41:02.740]  instead of 100 more
[41:02.740 --> 41:08.420]  and they have two storage tiers 32 and 128 and the 128 I think is I think
[41:08.420 --> 41:11.860]  Or both might be exactly the same price as the same iphones
[41:12.900 --> 41:14.900]  right
[41:14.900 --> 41:18.900]  So I guess whatever math apple was doing wasn't just about gouging
[41:20.420 --> 41:22.420]  No, I don't think so. Uh
[41:23.060 --> 41:25.140]  The colors are called very silver
[41:25.700 --> 41:30.900]  Quite black and limited edition really blue which is already out of stock
[41:32.660 --> 41:35.940]  I almost bought the blue. I literally pulled it up and I was pre-ordering it
[41:35.940 --> 41:40.900]  And then i've decided to just kind of wait and see what the first impressions were and you know, did you order one already?
[41:41.540 --> 41:47.220]  No, I haven't ordered i'm going to but I don't I am too but I I have probably just buy black. I don't want to wait
[41:48.260 --> 41:55.540]  Although i'm curious why blue is limited edition. Is it just artificial scarcity or is it because it's probably harder to make those finishes are tougher
[41:56.100 --> 41:58.340]  You know, I mean like even look at the jet black, right?
[41:58.340 --> 41:59.540]  It's like you know
[41:59.540 --> 42:04.580]  Some just nine step process that they have to anodize it and they have to clear coat it and polish it and clear coat it
[42:04.580 --> 42:07.860]  And polish it and click on it and polish it and click on and polish. It just takes longer
[42:08.020 --> 42:10.260]  I would guess they just produced a lot less of them because of that
[42:11.300 --> 42:15.220]  It looks like most of their product photography is the very silver
[42:15.540 --> 42:21.780]  Um, they skipped gold so there's no gold. They can't accuse them of ripping off or following apple in that regard
[42:22.260 --> 42:28.820]  Um, i'm kind of impressed if the black looks as good as it does on the aluminum that i'm kind of impressed that they've already
[42:28.820 --> 42:35.000]  Caught up and who knows how much of that expertise google brought and who much how who knows how much they're leaning on htc
[42:35.700 --> 42:43.220]  But famously the reason that we've had space gray for a couple of years is because black proved so hard even for apple
[42:43.300 --> 42:44.820]  who's who's
[42:44.820 --> 42:47.220]  unparalleled expertise in materials, um
[42:48.100 --> 42:53.380]  You know couldn't even get right and here they're coming out of the black out of the out of the box with a black anodized aluminum
[42:53.380 --> 42:58.100]  Yeah, yeah, like I said, I haven't seen it in person. So I don't know how how black the black is
[42:58.100 --> 43:03.300]  But it looks pretty black. I mean look you look at the black top section and it is lighter than that
[43:03.540 --> 43:08.500]  But it's not like gray like like the previous iphones were yeah
[43:08.820 --> 43:14.260]  It's I don't know. There's some things that look weird about it to me, but it certainly is the best looking iPhone or
[43:15.140 --> 43:17.140]  Android phone i've seen in a while
[43:17.220 --> 43:18.500]  to my eyes
[43:18.500 --> 43:22.020]  Um, yeah, they a lot of them have too many notes because they got to differentiate right, right
[43:22.020 --> 43:26.900]  You're in this crowded market with a bunch of competitors and you you have you're sitting on this verizon shelf
[43:26.900 --> 43:30.580]  Like people walk into the verizon store and they're like, oh I want to put uh, that one looks cool
[43:30.580 --> 43:34.500]  You know, that's that's what they're playing to that audience and google's not
[43:36.020 --> 43:43.140]  This shot i'll send it to you this shot seems to me to really emphasize. I think this is where you can kind of see the wedge shape
[43:45.700 --> 43:46.900]  I don't know
[43:46.900 --> 43:53.140]  I don't know. Uh amoled display instead of lcd, but just about everybody other than apple has gone to amoled
[43:53.780 --> 43:56.420]  Uh, and there's rumors that apple is going to go to amoled
[43:57.060 --> 43:59.220]  Eventually sooner than later. I don't know
[43:59.220 --> 44:03.380]  Uh, it seems to me like I mean amoled still has advantages on blacks
[44:03.380 --> 44:08.660]  And I think they're inherent to the technology that a black on amoled is going to be a darker black
[44:09.300 --> 44:12.340]  A deeper black whatever you want to describe it than lcd can ever do
[44:12.340 --> 44:16.340]  Um, but it seems to me like both technologies are sort of approaching each other at this
[44:16.820 --> 44:17.460]  Take you know
[44:17.460 --> 44:23.220]  both are catching up to the strengths and weakness or strengths of the others and get and getting rid of their weaknesses like the days
[44:23.220 --> 44:24.660]  when amoled
[44:24.660 --> 44:28.100]  Couldn't reproduce color faithfully or I think are probably over
[44:30.020 --> 44:35.780]  Yeah, I mean that was always the the I mean amoled was a new technology for a long time and it was harder to make and
[44:35.780 --> 44:39.780]  Everything else but it's starting to become much more, you know, widely available
[44:39.780 --> 44:43.780]  It's starting to become much more, you know, widely adopted. I remember it was like
[44:44.580 --> 44:47.460]  In particular the flickr logo with which had the magenta
[44:48.100 --> 44:52.580]  You could like you could like damage your retina, but just by looking at the flickr logo. That's right
[44:53.060 --> 44:57.380]  Yeah, and well the advantage to amoled overall is that the colors are more neutral, right?
[44:57.460 --> 45:02.660]  And like lcd's always have a sort of like they fight against the blue cast, you know
[45:03.140 --> 45:08.740]  uh and that uh that you're moving to amoled sort of fixes that without having to
[45:08.740 --> 45:13.780]  Do software trickery, uh on top of it to filter that but I don't know I think
[45:14.180 --> 45:18.020]  lcd and plain switching stuff is it just like was so good because
[45:18.660 --> 45:24.660]  It didn't burn in and there was like, you know, it's really easy to to make in pretty decent quality
[45:25.060 --> 45:29.140]  But yeah, I think everything's going to be amoled pretty soon because of the better color rendition
[45:30.020 --> 45:35.220]  I think it just comes down to the scale, you know, and you have to remember that for apple to switch
[45:35.220 --> 45:39.140]  To switch it's they're switching like 70 million displays in the first quarter
[45:40.900 --> 45:44.980]  So I don't it's not surprising to me at all that they might be late to that game
[45:46.660 --> 45:47.540]  Um
[45:47.540 --> 45:53.220]  Just because that they kid there's no way they were going to shift in the early years when the color of reproduction was so bad
[45:53.780 --> 45:58.980]  And even now if they might want to they have to wait not just until you can make one that's up to their qualities for
[45:59.540 --> 46:03.060]  Just how good does it look really which is ultimately what apple cares about?
[46:03.060 --> 46:08.820]  It's not really what you can measure in any kind of test. It's just look just look at it with your eyes. Does it look good?
[46:09.460 --> 46:12.680]  Um, but they've got to be able to do it where they can make it in iphone quantities
[46:13.380 --> 46:15.620]  Let me take a break. I want to talk. I want to talk camera
[46:16.420 --> 46:18.180]  uh
[46:18.180 --> 46:20.180]  On the pixel
[46:20.420 --> 46:21.220]  Right, uh
[46:21.220 --> 46:26.500]  But let me take a break and thank our second sponsor and just because it seems like a natural point in the show to do
[46:26.500 --> 46:33.220]  So it's our good friends at igloo. You guys know igloo. They make the intranet that doesn't suck anyone
[46:33.220 --> 46:38.820]  Who's worked in a corporate environment knows how painful intranets can be the content stale the interface is ugly
[46:39.060 --> 46:42.660]  You can't access it on your phone. You have to do it with a lot of pinching and zooming
[46:43.140 --> 46:47.460]  Uh, and nobody uses it because they don't like it igloo is an internet intranet
[46:47.540 --> 46:51.620]  You will actually like because it's designed for the user
[46:51.620 --> 46:57.700]  It's designed to be nice and therefore people use it because it's nice and because people use it
[46:58.340 --> 46:59.780]  It stays up to date
[46:59.780 --> 47:07.460]  It gives you the flexibility to get your team's work done how you want to do it where you want and on whatever device you want
[47:07.860 --> 47:11.160]  igloo is truly building a modern product meant for 2015
[47:12.020 --> 47:19.540]  Not for 1997 you can share news organize files coordinate calendars manage projects to do's
[47:19.540 --> 47:23.220]  All in one place. They've got annotation on documents
[47:23.220 --> 47:26.660]  They've done a lot of work in the last year or two on the document sharing stuff
[47:27.620 --> 47:30.580]  And everything can be social you can have comments if you want
[47:30.740 --> 47:33.300]  It's all configurable to comments and like buttons
[47:33.300 --> 47:35.780]  So everybody within your team can do all the sort of stuff
[47:36.100 --> 47:40.740]  That you're used to doing on social networks right there within your own private intranet
[47:42.020 --> 47:44.020]  And everything is responsive
[47:44.020 --> 47:46.020]  web design wise so it looks
[47:46.020 --> 47:50.920]  Fantastic on everything from your phone to your tablet to your big giant 5k iMac
[47:51.480 --> 47:54.840]  um, so go to igloo software dot com slash
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.480]  Tts tts for the talk show igloo software dot com slash tts
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.840]  And you can get a free trial for your team and see for yourself. Just how good it is. My thanks to them
[48:08.360 --> 48:09.720]  uh
[48:09.720 --> 48:11.720]  I wanted to talk about this so
[48:11.720 --> 48:18.600]  Um, they're bright google's bragging on the camera. It might be a great camera, but they're banking it all on
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.000]  These the scores from dx o mark and I didn't have time before the show to look this up
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.600]  But there was something else recently where like within the last year or so where dx o mark came out with something about apple's image
[48:30.680 --> 48:34.680]  Quality and they have this this test that comes out they they
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.560]  I don't know. They do they run these tests and then they get a number from one to a hundred
[48:39.560 --> 48:45.480]  And that's it like that. So the the the pixel phone how good's the picture of your kids? Oh, it's 86
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.280]  Yeah, it's an 86 picture. How good is this camera? It's pretty good, but not so good. It's an 89
[48:50.920 --> 48:52.920]  and
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.400]  I'd I this to me sounds like bullshit and I know some people will say well
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.240]  That's because you're a fan of the iphone and you've got an iphone and and so if apple had the higher score
[49:03.400 --> 49:05.400]  You'd be bragging about that
[49:05.400 --> 49:11.720]  I I don't because I don't understand how you do this and it's not like the iphone is that far behind the iphone 7 is at
[49:12.280 --> 49:15.560]  86 on their scale. I don't know if that's for both the
[49:17.400 --> 49:20.360]  Iphone 7 plus and the 7 or just the iphone 7
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.000]  There's a couple of android phones that are at 87 and 88
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.560]  Including the samsung galaxy s7 edge which i've heard is is
[49:29.560 --> 49:36.360]  Which i've heard is is a and i've seen examples from is probably the the one camera that if anything's better than the iphone
[49:36.360 --> 49:38.360]  It's the galaxy s7
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.560]  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think the s7 is probably the best camera out there other than the iphone
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.520]  You know of shipping phones or whatever whatever you want to call it
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.360]  I saw I mean I find this scale to be a little bit weird because there's like
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.800]  The moto z force droid is rated higher than the iphone 7 as is the experience z5
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.120]  Uh, the galaxy galaxy s6 edge, which is a generation old
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.960]  Um the htc 10. I mean, that's the problem with numerical scales, right? Is it they they don't make any sense across generations?
[50:10.200 --> 50:12.200]  They don't make any sense
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.200]  You know out of model year and frankly, they just don't make any really damn sense at all
[50:16.280 --> 50:22.120]  I'm, i'm not a fan of numeric scales. I never assign them to reviews. I'm not a huge fan. I think it's enormously reductive
[50:22.760 --> 50:26.680]  Uh, and I think you know, you could give somebody even if you want to give them the cheat sheet, you know
[50:26.680 --> 50:28.840]  You give them a simple one-line, you know
[50:28.840 --> 50:31.400]  kind of explanation of why something is good or bad or
[50:31.800 --> 50:36.440]  Kind of where it rates in the grand scheme of things and you're doing much people a much better favor than a number
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.960]  Which is marketing it's not actually anything, you know
[50:40.600 --> 50:45.480]  It it even goes so far like in it. I think everybody has stored even at a consumer level
[50:45.480 --> 50:47.720]  People have gotten away from counting megapixels
[50:49.720 --> 50:54.120]  And you know for years people, you know who knew would say, you know megapixels
[50:54.120 --> 50:59.880]  They are important and they certainly were pretty important in the early days of digital photography where where you know
[50:59.880 --> 51:04.280]  If you only had like a two megapixel phone, you really couldn't there's only there's a limit to how far you could
[51:04.920 --> 51:09.400]  Even if it was perfectly exposed there's a limit to how far you could blow it up because the pixels just weren't there
[51:09.800 --> 51:11.800]  To make a poster size print
[51:13.880 --> 51:19.640]  We long ago got past that and things like well how big are the pixels on the sensor not just how many there are
[51:19.640 --> 51:25.480]  but how big they are and that you could you know, just as simply that a camera with fewer but bigger pixels could get much better
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.480]  Image quality than a camera with more but smaller pixels to fit it in the same space
[51:30.920 --> 51:32.920]  And there's so many other factors
[51:32.920 --> 51:38.680]  Photography is so multi-variant that the idea that you could reduce it like at least with the megapixel comparison
[51:38.680 --> 51:42.920]  You really are counting something and you can argue whether it makes for a better camera or not
[51:42.920 --> 51:48.440]  But you could say well 15 megapixels is more than 12 megapixels. You can't deny that
[51:48.440 --> 51:51.960]  You can't deny that you could argue about whether it actually makes for a better camera or not
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.560]  But it's at least when you're comparing those numbers you're comparing the same thing. Whereas
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.520]  Saying this one gets an 89. I I I don't know it
[52:01.080 --> 52:04.280]  Seems like bullshit to me and I didn't think google's heart was in it
[52:04.280 --> 52:05.640]  I had maybe i'm reading into it
[52:05.640 --> 52:07.800]  But when they talked about it on stage in the event
[52:08.360 --> 52:11.960]  To me when they said that I forget the guy's name who was talking about the camera
[52:11.960 --> 52:14.120]  it just seemed to me like his heart wasn't in it because
[52:14.120 --> 52:18.760]  Google people naturally google naturally draws people who want to measure things that are real
[52:19.880 --> 52:23.400]  And this to me seems like a bullshit sensor the example photos
[52:23.400 --> 52:28.280]  They showed taken with the pixels did look very nice to me. I have no doubt. Well,
[52:29.240 --> 52:35.000]  I don't deny that it might have a very nice camera. It might be a better camera than the iphone 7. I don't know but
[52:35.800 --> 52:40.360]  Using dxomark to prove it to me raises some red red alerts
[52:40.360 --> 52:45.320]  Well, if you go to uh, I mean the megapixels discussion, I think is apt right because you got like
[52:45.960 --> 52:48.120]  In the first really affordable
[52:48.760 --> 52:55.880]  Quote-unquote commercial digital slr was the 30d right and around that time was the time of the age of the mavica
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.520]  most people don't remember it but it was the
[52:58.680 --> 53:02.520]  Digital camera that you threw a floppy disk into that sony made
[53:02.760 --> 53:07.080]  And it took pictures onto a floppy disk and then they came out with the cd mavica and so on and so forth
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.640]  but from those days all the way on through to like canna came out with this um
[53:12.280 --> 53:14.280]  I think it was a g6
[53:14.280 --> 53:19.160]  And the previous model the g5 don't quote me don't at me because i'm sure i'm getting these model numbers wrong
[53:19.160 --> 53:20.680]  but it was something like you know,
[53:20.680 --> 53:27.800]  2008 or 2009 or somewhere around there or a little bit earlier and they came out with this compact g-series camera
[53:27.800 --> 53:33.080]  Which is you know compact point and shoot and it the previous year's model year had been 12 megapixel
[53:33.080 --> 53:39.400]  And this model year was a 10 megapixel and everybody was like going ape like customer wise like people would you know
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.720]  Go like why are you you know, why are you I used to sell I was selling cameras at the time and they're like oh
[53:43.720 --> 53:50.600]  Why do you uh, you know, why does it go down and you have to sort of explain to them about pixel pitch, right?
[53:50.600 --> 53:55.640]  And the size of the capture element and how a smaller megapixel rating, you know
[53:55.640 --> 54:01.720]  Anything over eight megapixels is already going to give you a great eight by ten and and larger even so at that point
[54:01.720 --> 54:06.440]  So at that point it's all a wash and for them to get better image quality
[54:06.440 --> 54:11.880]  They had to concentrate on the size of the elements to reduce the noise and to give you a better picture quality all of that
[54:11.880 --> 54:17.000]  And so the numbers race is like a it's a it's a just long done
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.960]  I mean, it's done almost ten years ago now, you know
[54:19.960 --> 54:25.000]  And that is that's the thing that you get into when you start reading things numerically
[54:25.000 --> 54:33.000]  so like this DxO mark has these really wacky phones rated above the iPhone 7 because the chart crosses model years and those
[54:33.480 --> 54:35.880]  Cameras have lower pixel pitch and worse quality
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.880]  But in fact are rated quote-unquote better because they were rated on that scale of the older phones
[54:42.220 --> 54:44.680]  but then you have in addition like the
[54:45.680 --> 54:49.240]  Thing that bothers me about DxO DxO has been around for a lot of years
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.600]  But in the last couple of years they've started marketing an attachment for the iPhone camera
[54:53.600 --> 54:56.080]  that is supposed to make it like
[54:57.560 --> 54:59.080]  DSLR quality or whatever
[54:59.080 --> 55:04.120]  It's basically a huge sensor a much bigger sensor that can fit in your iPhone in an external
[55:04.520 --> 55:10.240]  unit that you plug into the lightning port right and it's like it sits on the side like I like a tumor and
[55:10.440 --> 55:13.320]  You know takes better pictures and I'm sure it takes but I have never tried one
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.040]  We are our camera guys have tried one and they think it's fine
[55:16.200 --> 55:22.000]  But the thing is is like you go to DxO mark you go to this review of the pixel and it's literally the logo of
[55:22.000 --> 55:22.960]  the site
[55:22.960 --> 55:25.720]  the charts on the side on the right hand side of the page and
[55:26.760 --> 55:30.360]  the pixel, you know overview is right there and
[55:31.560 --> 55:33.560]  Framing the pixel
[55:33.640 --> 55:39.520]  Review of the camera is an enormous banner for the DxO one iPhone attachment
[55:39.520 --> 55:44.280]  And then down at the bottom a pop-up banner is discover the DxO one
[55:44.600 --> 55:50.440]  Crow quality camera miniaturized connected with a picture of an iPhone and this thing plugged into it, right?
[55:50.440 --> 55:53.800]  So look, I'm sure these folks are very nice
[55:53.800 --> 55:59.160]  I'm sure this you know, this David Cardinale is doing you know, the best work you can do writing this article
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.280]  but it does raise questions about how much you can rely on the
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.520]  rating of
[56:05.520 --> 56:12.000]  A camera company on another person's camera when they're actually made for the same device, right?
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.800]  Like oh what's better the iPhones camera or the one we made for the iPhone, you know
[56:15.800 --> 56:21.680]  And I would look it's probably fine and it's probably like these three-point difference between that and the pixel
[56:21.920 --> 56:23.760]  Probably doesn't have anything to do with it
[56:23.760 --> 56:29.040]  It's just I always take stuff coming from DxO about smartphones with a grain of salt as long as they're in the camera business
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.120]  I always will well my gut, you know, right that they've got a motivation to make iPhone users
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.880]  Think maybe the iPhone camera isn't that great because they're selling a separate camera that you can add to your iPhone
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.040]  Like don't worry, you don't write to replace your iPhone. You can just buy our camera that you stick on the lighting
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.600]  Yeah, oh your camera is only in 84. Oh, it's too bad, but we can make it a hundred
[56:49.600 --> 56:51.600]  Do they give a rating to their DxO?
[56:52.880 --> 56:54.880]  Don't know I don't know
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.320]  That would be good though. I would love to look at that. Maybe they rate it like a 70 or something. That would be funny
[57:01.320 --> 57:05.240]  But anyhow the pixel like I really it's hard to kind of make any
[57:05.480 --> 57:08.120]  Value judgments on the camera until I take a look at it, right?
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.360]  Like I don't want to go off the handle and say oh, it's probably crappy when it maybe is amazing
[57:12.360 --> 57:15.120]  And I just haven't seen it yet. I that would be the worst thing
[57:15.600 --> 57:21.240]  There are some specifications that do tell some stories about the camera. It has a larger pixel pitch than the iPhone
[57:21.240 --> 57:24.920]  So however, they arrange their sensor and size of the sensor
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.480]  They manage to map out larger capture elements per pixel, which does help right?
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.520]  It helps with color rendition the way that picture elements work is that there's like a small
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.280]  Flat capture element that sits on the back of the sensor and then above it
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.880]  there's a sort of well right and that well divides it from the the
[57:44.360 --> 57:50.760]  Capture elements next to it and the way light shines in especially from the edges can affect how much
[57:51.280 --> 57:57.960]  color information that that capture element picks up and how it reads as like a red pixel or green or whatever the case may be and
[57:58.400 --> 58:05.880]  All of that is predicated on how large each of those wells are and so the bigger the pixel pitch the wider those wells
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.920]  Are the better color rendition the more accurate color the less?
[58:09.920 --> 58:13.920]  You know weirdness around the edges of the borders of two colors
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.120]  Where they blend into one another or divide from one another all of that is going to be affected by the pixel pitch
[58:19.120 --> 58:24.080]  So seeing a larger pixel pitch is already a great sign. So that's good, right?
[58:24.520 --> 58:31.360]  And then on top of that though, do you have I believe it's a smaller aperture then the widest aperture on the iPhones
[58:31.360 --> 58:33.840]  I think it's a 2 2.0. Whereas the iPhones a
[58:33.840 --> 58:38.120]  I think what's 1.8. Is that a half stop or full stop? I don't know. I think it's a half
[58:38.120 --> 58:41.240]  I think it's a half stop. Yeah, but anyhow, it's it's brighter, right?
[58:41.520 --> 58:44.640]  So people are saying oh, it's brighter, you know, the iPhones brighter
[58:44.640 --> 58:50.360]  But at the same time the larger pixel pitch could offset it and then some you know, because it is significantly larger
[58:50.360 --> 58:54.760]  So, you know, I'm interested to see what it can do. I'm curious, right?
[58:54.840 --> 59:02.740]  It's there's so many variables that go into photography and that it really is and it's always been it's not just new to digital photography
[59:02.740 --> 59:05.720]  It's always been an argument over how much you know, how much glass do you want to carry around?
[59:07.280 --> 59:09.280]  Right
[59:11.120 --> 59:12.640]  You know and
[59:12.640 --> 59:15.120]  Sensor versus the lens and you know bigger, you know
[59:15.120 --> 59:19.360]  Getting more light by having doing it on the sensor side as opposed to doing it on the aperture side
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.920]  It's effectively it in a bottom line is what is it like to actually go out and shoot photos with the thing?
[59:23.920 --> 59:25.920]  And that's what matters
[59:25.920 --> 59:32.600]  One difference I've seen is that it doesn't it unless they're not talking about it. It doesn't have optical image stabilization
[59:33.780 --> 59:39.380]  So I think on stills that's going to hurt them a little bit because it certainly is gonna that's you know
[59:39.380 --> 59:45.080]  It really does help with stills on video. I'm not sure because it seems you know, they're there they're they have like a
[59:46.080 --> 59:48.080]  gyroscope driven
[59:48.960 --> 59:54.280]  Digital stabilization for video and they showed an example that was supposedly shot side-by-side where they
[59:54.280 --> 01:00:00.280]  Exaggerated the camera shake of video while you walk and their stabilized version looked pretty good
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.840]  Yeah, I mean there's still the you know, the normal rolling shutter effects
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.920]  And then you do get the little blur and low light and stuff, but it looks like they're digital
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.440]  I mean, you know, this is Google's kind of bag, you know, the digital stabilization I would estimate would probably be pretty good
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.400]  So it's not I'm not shocked to hear that it is pretty good. Yeah video, but yeah, no no optical stabilization
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.340]  I have an app. Maybe there's other apps that do it, but I have an app for the iPhone called horizon
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:30.820]  I don't know if you've ever heard of it. It it's an app that lets you shoot horizontal video no matter how you hold your iPhone
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.280]  Okay, so what they're doing is they're just using a crop of the sensor sure
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:43.600]  To do it and so that you can hold you now, obviously there's there is a you know, it's not magic
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.020]  It doesn't shoot the same exact video that you would get holding it horizontally when you hold it visit, you know vertically
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:55.880]  It's it's a crop. So it's almost like the equivalent of being zoomed in a little bit, right?
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.320]  But you get a preview while you shoot but there it's I they must be doing the same thing because it also the other effect
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.520]  Is even when you when you use horizon to shoot even if you hold your your iPhone
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.820]  Horizontally, you still get stabilization
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.600]  And yes, you know, it's all the digital stabilization systems are exactly that they're all based on crop
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.960]  And so the the most intelligent ones will crop dynamically right the earliest ones are
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.360]  The the earliest
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.600]  Digital stabilization systems were all based on a fixed crop
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.600]  So they would essentially crop in 20% of your resolution and then use that as a buffer
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.960]  Right to try and stabilize your image and the more dynamic ones the newer ones like this Google one most likely although
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960]  I haven't read deep on it
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.520]  Vary that crop by how fast you're moving your phone. They use the accelerometer data and gyroscope data to say
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.880]  Hey, you know, you're vibrating you're you know, jigging a lot
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.640]  So let's go ahead and just crop in a ton and then oh you're more stable now you've stopped walking or whatever
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.280]  Let's let's go back out and get you as much resolution as we can
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.240]  So the more intelligent ones that's what they do and that's the way Apple's
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.800]  Digital stabilization works on the like the iPhone success where it has no optical, right?
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:13.560]  I think it's a win for the iPhone 7 though, and I think it'll be proven out that it that on all of the iPhone 7
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.240]  Plus and regular size you get true optical image stabilization including for video
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.440]  So that's how you what I missed the hell out of it in 2x. Oh
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.180]  Yeah, it's the worst. Yeah, it's like
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:32.720]  Yeah, it's the one thing I keep telling myself to console myself that my personal iPhone doesn't have the 2x camera
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.720]  Oh
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240]  So who cares right
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.360]  It is very shaky. I'll tell you especially because it's 2x, right?
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.760]  You know, so hey, it's yeah, it's the best you pay but it's a it's a camera for well-lit situations
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.440]  While we're on this the subject
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:58.560]  I don't know that there's anybody who knows more about the depth effect on the iPhone 7 plus than you you you had pre-release access
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.400]  To the feature a couple days before the developer beta came out
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.640]  Your explanation of it is as as detailed technically as anything
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.440]  I've seen more detailed in some regards even than what Apple has seen because you you've poked at them to get them to tell you
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.120]  Like that the that they wrote their own custom disc blur
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.320]  Which is funny because it came up a couple times
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.400]  Like I keep seeing people say that it's like a Gaussian blur, which is exactly what you said in your first version of the report
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400]  I'm so irritated
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600]  That it was in my heart, right?
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.680]  Because I think cuz I remember talking to you about it behind the scenes and you were somewhat skeptical that it was a Gaussian blur
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.680]  You're like, but that's what they told me
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:44.680]  Right. That's why you're told that it's Gaussian. You just say okay. Yeah, honestly a reader and I'm sorry
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.440]  I don't have his I don't have the tweet in front of me
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.860]  But he he tweeted at me and was like hey this picture of a strawberry
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:55.500]  That you have in your piece. Like I'm the edges of it the blue the bloom really looks like a disc blur
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.860]  Yeah, and the guy's probably in visual, you know in visual work somehow
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:05.020]  He's a designer or in visual effects or something is the visual effects supervisors and those people are writing articles about it
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:09.740]  Now they all have it nailed and you know, like they're they're super sharp about this because they do it all day
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.620]  They they simulate camera effects for a living, right?
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.020]  Or many of them do but the he said hey this kind of looks like a disc blur
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.860]  Are you sure and I was like no no and I I was really like, oh, you know and he's like
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.740]  Oh, just just asking and I'm like no. No, you're you know what? Hey, you know what actually now that I look at it
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:30.820]  And so I went back and yeah, it's a custom disc blur. So I was really irritated. I hate getting anything wrong
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.660]  So it's just like it makes me itch
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.660]  Here's the thing I've noticed and I've had a little few brief
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:42.580]  Conversations with people on Twitter about it is at least for me personally while I was shooting test shots with the iPhone 7 plus
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:48.540]  Review unit with the feature on it looks to me like they're doing something different with the noise
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.980]  that to me
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:56.740]  It gives a sort of film like grain to the noise on
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.400]  those images and I don't see the same thing on the non portrait shots and I
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.740]  And I don't know if I'm seeing what I want to see because I've always been no I mean it too
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.820]  I've seen it too. And honestly, I haven't seen it as much on my shots
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:15.340]  but maybe I just haven't been looking but I've seen it a ton on examples like these people are showing me or
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.920]  Things that I see on Instagram and yes, I have seen it. I don't and I don't know
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.040]  I don't I have no information about whether they're artificially
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:28.140]  Under sharpening it right or sharpening it with a tighter radius
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.140]  Excuse me
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:36.760]  under noise reducing it is what I meant or sharpening it with a tighter radius because I I am not a fan of how
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:42.480]  Aggressively Apple noise reduces their images. Yes, so I feel that the the iPhone's
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.760]  Images while great would be better
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.920]  Subjectively right and this is me talking
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.320]  This is not like some grandiose statement about better or worse for everybody
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:00.240]  But I definitely feel that they would be better if they were sharpened a little bit less while still
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.680]  Understanding why they do it because most people would just rather not see any grain, you know
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.160]  And that to me that's the trade-off and I get it. I just don't like it. Yeah
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.440]  I've never been afraid of the grain
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:19.320]  I used to when I shot film would tend to just leave the camera loaded with 400 or even 800 speed film
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.600]  Because I always thought like if you're gonna leave some film in there be ready for any situation
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:31.320]  And if it means that I'm an outside and I'm getting a lot of grain because I could be shooting like it with 100 speed film
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:37.960]  So be it because the color still look good and I can shoot indoors and
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.960]  Get an exposure where I couldn't if I had 100 speed film already loaded in there
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.960]  And if there was a slider I could set in iOS that adjusted
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.920]  Noise reduction. Mm-hmm
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:54.400]  I would probably turn it to the lowest setting that Apple would allow me to get away with knowing that Apple
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.720]  Isn't going to say don't noise reduce at all
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.520]  because that's one of the things people have been noticing now that you can shoot raw with the iPhone camera is
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:08.400]  Holy shit how much noise there is on the image when you shoot raw and it's just what the camera is, right everybody
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.600]  I know who's like using Lightroom to shoot raw on the iPhone 7. It's like holy shit these
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.960]  There's somebody at Apple or you know on the camera team who are like dude, you know how small that sensor is
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:27.320]  You know what kind of miracles we're pulling and like that's why I am I always say, you know
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.800]  I try to be really careful and when I'm talking about this noise and say for me like I would be okay if they dialed
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.520]  It back but they're they really are performing miracles
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:42.520]  I mean, honestly the raw image that comes off of that sensor is already better than the actual data, you know
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.320]  that they get so I mean, I think that it's you're getting a
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.360]  Viewport a viewport with the raw stuff, you know
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.420]  We're into just how good the ISP is
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.700]  Yeah, I mean, you know there you could always tweak it. I talked about this last week. One of my most
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.840]  Beloved devices not just cameras but devices I've ever owned was my original
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.060]  Rico GRD the fur Rico GR
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:12.000]  Is where the point-and-shoot cameras that they made for film for years and when they first went digital they called it the GRD
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.560]  It was the first generation one and it's very confusing because then they had the GRD 2 and the GRD 3 I think and then
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.640]  They went back they went back and they just had one instead of numbering it for they just went back to Rico GR
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.760]  And so it's very confusing, but I had the original one. I think I bought it in 2006 and
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.200]  The whole reason I bought it
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.860]  I bought it without ever knowing anybody who owned it just based on the reviews and it was gray market wasn't sold and officially
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.860]  sold in North America
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.360]  Was that everybody said that Rico's digital sensor is tuned
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:49.120]  The ISP is tuned to turn them make the noise look more like film grain and everybody who had one on these boards would say
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.680]  So and I looked at people's flicker uploads and looked at you know, flicker would let you see the original
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.880]  So it's like I damned if that doesn't look like film grain not
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:04.280]  digital noise or at least less more along those lines and the idea was and Rico is explicit about it as opposed to being sort
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.500]  Of secretive like Apple and not really talking about it
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040]  Rico is very explicit and said
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.480]  But there's a limit to what we can do with these small and it was a you know
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.760]  Very small sensor for a 2006 point-and-shoot. There's a limit to how much there's going to be noise
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.180]  And so rather than trying to hide the noise
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:29.160]  We our efforts are to make the noise aesthetically pleasing and that's exactly what film the film industry did for a hundred years
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.340]  So the people who are like anti-noise would say ah you film
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:38.420]  You guys are just celebrate film. You're just you know, you're romantics and
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.220]  you know it
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.040]  You're celebrating something that was a that was a technical limitation anyway
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:52.620]  But I would argue in my my opinion and sort of as an amateur but the reason film grain looked good wasn't just nostalgia
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:59.980]  It was because the Kodak and Fuji and the other film companies spent a hundred years making the noise look better
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.580]  You know what? Well, I call it noise now, right, you know that it wasn't like
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.180]  It's not just because it was old that we thought film grain looked good
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.860]  It was that they you know decades of work went into making it look good
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.340]  Anyway, I see it in the 7-plus portrait shots, and I don't know if it's my imagination or not
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:23.780]  Yeah, I mean it I do know I do know that they you know that
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:31.020]  The work that was done to tune the ISP was definitely done with an eye to what had come in the past
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.940]  But not just photographs, you know other other works of art, too
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:39.060]  I mean remember they're creating this custom from scratch and Apple's never one to kind of go with the
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.500]  Accepted wisdom around something like that
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:48.320]  So there they had an opportunity to sort of tune the ISP to however they wanted and now that the camera
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.440]  Honestly, what I mean, what what else is a defining, you know?
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.880]  definitive
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.960]  Deciding factor between phones most of the time. It's the camera these days, you know
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.160]  And you could argue that AI or like the assistant features may be you what they're seeking for to be next
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.680]  But right now if you're deciding between three cameras or three phones on the shelf
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.960]  You kind of want to know which one has the best camera because that's your camera, too
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.380]  You know, it's it's a huge factor when they decide on on picking stuff. So
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:22.340]  Now that they have an opportunity to to really have an amazing
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:29.300]  Camera that has optical zoom that has all of these additional features that could be unlocked in the future by having two lenses
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.740]  and they're able to tune the ISP how they want they can pick and choose and and
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.660]  Really create a look that is new, you know and it may have some
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:46.380]  Elements of film it may have some elements of what we consider to be like, you know
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.380]  characteristic of digital
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:54.540]  Images, which would be you know, maybe a little bit crisper maybe a little bit lower noise or whatever
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.140]  But you could definitely kind of see them combining the two qualities
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.900]  I've been thinking one thing that's occurred to me as more and more people are shooting with this
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.300]  You know, you'd still have to have a beta
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.580]  So it's still pretty uncaught you have to a have to have this iPhone 7 plus and B
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.540]  You have to be willing to install the beta, but I've seen enough examples
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.500]  It occurs to add this thought had occurred to me
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.060]  but now the more I think about it the more I think it's going to be a big deal is that the number of
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.620]  People who see your photos on their own phones
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:26.660]  They're seeing them on Instagram on their phone or in Facebook or on Twitter or something like that
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:33.300]  They're seeing them in such a small size that the smaller the size you view the image at the more the more like a real
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.380]  Boca from a real large sensor camera the effect looks like
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:43.300]  you have to zoom in more you have to make it really big to see the
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:51.780]  Deficiencies of the trickery so right when you see somebody who has an iPhone 7 plus using this feature just in their Instagram feed you're
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.300]  you're gonna
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.820]  You're that's more compelling than looking at it blown up to a full size on your iMac
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.100]  Yeah, and comparing like a lot of obviously and this is not a dig
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.340]  It's sort of what people want to see but comparing it
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:11.700]  Against even in my piece like I had to I really had to compare it against the same shot
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:15.500]  Which it does shoot automatically the same shot without the effect, you know
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.060]  Because that's what we want to see right? Oh, what did it look like before?
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:19.860]  What does it look like after?
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:25.420]  but I honestly think that does it a disservice because I think you then it allows you to go through and like be really picky
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.860]  Any about like oh this particular thing is wrong or this, you know missed this or whatever
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.740]  But if you just look at it in isolation, they're really pretty good
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.940]  I mean, there's some that are really funky and weird and dumb and silly and it screws up, but it is very early and
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.540]  There are some shots out of it that are just great. Yeah, and you don't have to use them
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.700]  You know if it turns out weird you got the other one, which would have been what it would look like normally
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.700]  Yeah, so there's no loss
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.500]  Back to the pixel
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.260]  And I I don't think it I think a digression about the iPhone camera is fine
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.660]  because one of the but at a big picture, I think it's not just what the the
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:12.380]  pixels look like with it before you even turn them on and saying look this industrial design is is just
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.180]  blatantly following Apple's lead
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.900]  Everything about the pixels to me is is saying we're making an iPhone caliber
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:27.340]  You know, if we're going after the iPhone market, they've made a switching tool that I don't even know how it works. It's
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:31.020]  It's fascinating to me. I can't wait to see this. They have a cable
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:36.460]  They ship it with that as lightning on one side goes into the pixel on the other and takes things like your iMessages
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:42.620]  And your text messages from their phone. I don't understand how the something with a lightning cable is reading that I guess
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.660]  It's pretending to be like iTunes or something
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.460]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you'll have to give it permission on your iPhone right away that the life
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:55.340]  I want to trust it right trust this thing and it'll take it over and I guess it'll put your
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.180]  I
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:03.580]  Message and text message history into aloe, I guess or maybe their messages app
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.140]  I don't know which app they're gonna put that history into but that's a big deal
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.700]  Like they see they really I mean whether it's gonna work or not
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:17.860]  They seem to seriously be saying look we know there's a lot of people using iPhones who are also using heavily into Google services
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.020]  including I'm sure
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:26.540]  Thousands of people who work at Google and they're making they're doing the best effort they can to say we want to make it possible
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.620]  for you to switch and
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:33.980]  There's a couple of things that they're all on the tech spec page in a way
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:40.980]  That to me these are a couple of things where they're obviously ahead of Apple and you have to say, you know Apple
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:50.180]  It's it's they've I think that you know, they really need to catch up. Here's one of them unlimited storage for photos and videos at
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.780]  full resolution
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:57.420]  So if you buy a pixel your your Google Photos account will and here's what I'm curious about though
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:02.700]  Is it only for photos you've shot on the pixel or can you shoot 4k video on another camera?
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.860]  And because you have own a pixel you can upload it all to your Google account
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:11.660]  Mm-hmm. I don't know but even if it is only for the photos you shoot on the pixel
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.340]  That's that is a hell of a thing
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:21.220]  Apple gives you five gigabytes of storage for free and that includes everything your backups your documents
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.300]  And your photos and Google is saying for photos
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.860]  unlimited at full resolution
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:36.260]  That is a huge difference because real people run up against that five gigabyte limit if they shoot photos with any
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.580]  Regularity let alone if they shoot 1080p or 4k video
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:47.700]  Yeah, and that thing is that five gigabyte limit has been around forever, you know, I mean, I I think that it's if it
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.580]  I'm not sure this will because I don't know if people I
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.340]  Don't know if this is a big enough factor in people not buying an iPhone
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:00.540]  But if it does for lack of a better word shame
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.420]  it
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:10.900]  You know shame Apple into giving us unlimited storage for free or at least some enormous amount, you know some finite
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:19.060]  But enormous amount free I would love that that would be that would thank Google for that. Yeah, and even if Apple wanted to
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:27.580]  Segregate photos storage from other storage, you know instead of just saying you've got one bucket where everything goes into but but I think
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.580]  They should up both. I think five gigabytes is not enough
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:34.700]  Especially I really think the more I think about now that the minimum phone size is 32 gigabytes
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.500]  How can the storage be five gigabytes? Oh, it's impossible
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:42.540]  It's ridiculous like you go to backup and then like my wife and I have different we have separate iCloud accounts
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:48.620]  So we use the same iTunes account. So she gets all my purchases, but she has her own iCloud account
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:54.660]  So all of her photos and all that stuff synced to her phone, but I don't get them all in my photo stream, right?
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:59.780]  Not because we you know, don't we're all girls we care, but it's just you know less messy
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:05.180]  I mean, I got like fifteen hundred screenshots in my camera. Well, she didn't want to see all that junk, you know
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.720]  And these pictures of events she doesn't need she didn't know what I do for a living. So she's okay
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.880]  but the that whole like
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.440]  Oh, she has a five gigabytes and now I have to pay to upgrade her when I've already paid to upgrade myself
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:26.000]  because I have three phones and she's got her phone and my daughter's iPad and her iPad and you know,
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:32.640]  Etc. And the it's full instantly instantly, you know, so just to ensure that she doesn't lose
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:40.000]  Stuff she's got a backup to iCloud or up her iCloud storage because there's I mean she didn't even have a computer
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.780]  Like we are truly a post computer household aside from me
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:49.580]  Which has to sort of is like tied to my desktops because I choose to be right
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.540]  I mean, I could probably do my job from my iPhone. Don't tell my boss
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:59.460]  but you know that the the big screens do help especially on busy news days or when I'm you know,
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:04.300]  Managing a huge team across multiple continents, but my wife doesn't do that and her work
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.620]  I mean, they don't even let her bring computers into the OR so she doesn't care, right?
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:14.380]  And so for her her computer is her phone and is her iPad and she doesn't have anything to plug it into to back it
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.220]  Up, you know if I wasn't if I didn't have this, you know desktop
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:22.100]  there would be no option to do that and I don't even want her to do that right because I
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:29.380]  Erase and put install betas into all kinds of weird stuff on my machine and my machines encrypted and all kinds of junk
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:32.580]  So, you know this baby I'm not home and she can't get on it or whatever
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:38.900]  So for her iCloud is her computer, right? That is her storage. That is everything
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.620]  It's all of the storage in the world that she has aside from what's local on her phone
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:46.600]  And it's just really crippling and silly for it to be so small out of the gate
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:53.060]  Like it should guarantee that you should be able to back up a full iPhone. Yeah out of like out of the box
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:57.700]  Anything else is just kind of silly. Yeah, and I you know, it's
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:02.980]  It I'm only saying that Apple has to do this for people who've purchased
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:08.340]  devices of you know, I don't know where you cut it off, but you know, I
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:15.140]  I don't think that they should necessarily give free unlimited storage to anybody who just signs up for a free iCloud account
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.380]  But if you're if you're if you've bought a new device
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.900]  Especially the iPhones which would start at six hundred forty nine dollars or seven hundred dollars or something like that
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:28.060]  I I you know and it's easy for me. I always say this
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:33.380]  It's easy for me to spend Tim Cook's money from my armchair here. But here here's existence proof that it's possible
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:38.380]  Here's a phone you can buy for the exact same price as the iPhone that comes with free unlimited cloud storage for photos and video
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:45.900]  So, you know to me the bar is raised and it's way above it's not like the you know, five gigabytes versus ten gigabytes
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.900]  It's five gigabytes, which is not enough
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:56.220]  Versus unlimited pure and simple that Apple needs to catch up. The other one it's right here. Is that they do fast charging?
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.620]  They call it seven hours
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:02.980]  I don't mind sure seven hours of what but they say you can get seven hours of battery life in just 15 minutes
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:09.260]  With the pics right now. I thought here's what my guess was my guess was they've included a
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.620]  More expensive high watt
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:18.200]  Adapter and I'm looking at the tech spec and that's exactly it as it comes with a USB C 18 watt adapter
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:25.480]  Right, that's the the thing that makes the iPhone so slow to charge is that it comes with a 5 watt adapter
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.960]  It's if you plug an iPhone
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:34.060]  I think it's true for the regular 7 but I know it's true the 7 plus if you plug it into the expensive
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:42.420]  Ipad Pro 12 watt adapter it charges way faster and Apple sells. I forget how many watts it is, but they sell like a
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.740]  50 or $60
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.980]  standalone
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:51.140]  Adapter that'll charge it even faster than that. So it's not like iPhones can't do fast charging
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.260]  Nobody just knows about it because they ship with these
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.500]  measly little 5 watt adapters that charge well
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.320]  Sort of right like yeah, it will charge faster. Absolutely. You could charge it with an iPad adapter and it'll charge
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:10.020]  I don't know, you know, let's call it 2x faster, right? Right, but the the quick charging that's like 15 minutes for 7 hours
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:15.100]  or whatever, I mean that's like 4x or 5x the normal charging rate of a phone and
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.440]  Generally speaking that has to be enabled by quick charging secure
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:28.020]  circuitry so quick charging circuitry and then a controller which controls that obviously the rate and the voltage and all of that stuff coming
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.300]  Into the battery like Qualcomm makes a quick charge system, right? So if you're using snapdragons in your phone
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:38.540]  You can get their quick charge, you know plug and play and in your device as a manufacturer
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.860]  I'm saying you know
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:46.220]  You can you can grab Qualcomm's chip and put it in there and and they'll give you faster charging and all of that
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.260]  but I think it's just a
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.420]  there is a real like
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.060]  There's a real disconnect between
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:00.660]  this concept of oh, I'm gonna charge my phone real fast and
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.460]  I'm also going to
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:11.460]  Ensure that the battery lasts a long time, you know and and doesn't deteriorate because quick charging does damage batteries
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:17.300]  Right the faster you charge the the battery the more strain you put on it and the more aging
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:24.700]  Cycles you put on that that chemistry so there are trade-offs, you know, and sometimes they get hot and sometimes they explode
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.700]  so quick charging is is
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.940]  Good and an interesting technology that could very well pave the way towards like well
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:37.220]  If you can charge something in five minutes who really cares how long the battery?
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.460]  Lasts, you know, I tend to think that for the price that iPhones cost
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:46.420]  They should ship with at least the 10 watt power adapter. If not the 12 watt power adapter
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:53.620]  Yeah, I know it's a bigger adapter too, but I still feel like it would get you part of the way there
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.340]  I don't know if you've heard about this, but it's speaking of power adapters and stuff like that
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.140]  Samsung has some problems
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.340]  With the batteries in and their phones I
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.260]  Had I hadn't I hadn't heard did you see the story today?
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.940]  I'm sure you did because you stay on top of everything that some some guy was on a Southwest flight this morning and
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.520]  Yeah, his good note seven
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.880]  He would even powered it off. He says but whatever it it started burning a hole in his
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.980]  Pocket and so he got it out of a pocket and you know, there was smoke coming out of it
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.400]  So they evacuated before the plane took off planes on the ground and there you know
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:35.960]  The the flight staff on the Southwest is like well everybody, you know, let's get everybody off the plane. Nobody got hurt
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.260]  It's common orderly, you know
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  Disembarkation is that the word?
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:48.400]  Yes, and then they went in to take a look and it burned through the floor of the plane. I hadn't heard that bit
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.120]  but the scary part the really scary part is that it was a
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.560]  Updated the phone that he just bought on September 21st and was supposedly had like the marking on the package
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.920]  It says this is one of the good ones. Not one of the bad ones
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.600]  Right, which makes me think
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.400]  I've been wondering for a while with this
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.900]  Fiasco and people keep writing to me because I think people don't follow closely if people get on an airplane and apparently lately
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:16.660]  it's it were around the world you get on an airplane and one of the things they say is if you have a
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:23.460]  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 you must power it off now and keep it powered off for the entire flight, which is a terrible publicity
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.460]  I mean just dreadful
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.980]  Ever I've seen people on Twitter saying that they're telling people out in the airport to that they're you know
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:38.340]  Like, you know when they're like, hey, we're gonna board, you know flight 677. It's gonna board in about 10 minutes
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.660]  Oh, and if you have a galaxy note 7 you got to power it off
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.060]  Please board now if you get a galaxy 7 just throw it in the trash on your way in
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.460]  I've been wondering for a while
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.820]  How are they gonna deal with this when there's good ones and bad ones and and you say oh no
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:58.960]  No, no, I've got I just got my new one. It's got the green battery icon up in a corner
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.660]  It's it this one's good. Are they gonna are they gonna believe that or are they gonna be like no way buddy?
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.660]  You're turning it off and now
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:12.900]  Are you kidding me we couldn't for a decade we couldn't use our devices on planes just because they thought maybe
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:19.060]  Maybe something might interfere that they had no evidence of so I don't I don't think so
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:25.100]  My other thought with this news today that a quote unquote good galaxy note 7 caught fire on a plane
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.940]  Is that they're gonna wreck this for everybody and they're just gonna say you've got to turn all of your phone
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.820]  It's powered not just sleeping. You've got to power them off before you step on the plane and
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.020]  Did you know whether they can make you do that or not?
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:41.500]  But they could certainly notice if you have it out and you're sitting in your seat and you're dicking around on your phone
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.540]  And I don't know what I would do for them 20 or 30 minutes. God, that is the worst scenario
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.060]  Oh my god. Now you give me nightmares
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:52.920]  Poor Nick Bilton can under undo all of his work. Yeah
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.420]  Yeah, exactly Nick Bilton got us to be able to use our flights while we're landing
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:01.740]  Oh now we're I'm worried. Samsung's gonna wreck it for everybody. Well, I I know we got to wrap it up
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.340]  I know the baseball game is starting but I got to do a third sponsor now
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.940]  We can we can talk about every else you want to talk about for the rest of the show
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.660]  third and final sponsor
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.000]  Amazing coincidence given what we'll be talking about in the next segment of the show
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:20.120]  It really is a coincidence, but it's interesting is ero. Ee are Oh
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.380]  ero
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.740]  is a modern new Wi-Fi system for your house and
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.340]  The basic premise is one Wi-Fi router is not enough
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:38.340]  It's not strong enough signal for most people's houses. Maybe if you live in a you know, studio apartment or something like that
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.180]  Sure, you're fine
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:44.980]  but if you have a house that has more than more than one or two floors or it has thick walls or
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:51.040]  Any sorts of things that can interfere with the signal you might notice that there are parts of your house that don't get a good
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.240]  Wi-Fi signal your era was designed to change all of this. They make a single device
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.480]  It's a small elegant box about the size of an Apple TV
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.720]  Sort of Apple style round rec design and you just buy more than one of them
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.480]  So I think like one of the basic packs that they recommend for most people based on square footage
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.400]  You get a three pack you get three of these things you hook one of them up to your cable
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.280]  you put the other two strategically around the house and
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:21.640]  You that your work is done. You just the it negotiates the different pods negotiate with each other and
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:27.820]  They just do the work to form a mesh network that blankets your home and fast reliable Wi-Fi
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.020]  They sent me a three-pack when they started sponsoring a show. I set it up. I set it up thinking
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.880]  okay, I'll set this up and then I'll go back to my
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.480]  Apple whatever it's called
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.380]  And I never went back to my airport
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:48.860]  Because the era system was as good or better at every single spot in my house
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:54.900]  And I didn't I really was more work to like unbox the devices and plug them in than it was to set it up
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.380]  That's like you unbox it you plug them in and you're done. It's unbelievable
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:02.020]  The configuration goes through a really nice iPhone app
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.180]  So there's no you know
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.980]  Command line typing or logging in through a stupid web browser at a certain port or something like that
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.980]  You just get on the arrow app on your phone
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:16.900]  Could not be easier. They are protected with state-of-the-art WPA to encryption, of course
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:25.460]  Eros update automatically. So if there's like a security update or a performance update just updates by itself
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:27.860]  It's so great
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:33.300]  They have new feet they have new features like parental controls where you can create profiles for your kids and you can manage what?
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.300]  They what and when they have internet access
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.580]  to it
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:43.180]  Just go check it out. I cannot tell you everything there's to know about this in the course of one little sponsorship read
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.980]  Just know that they more or less recommend one euro for every thousand square feet of your home
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:52.940]  They've got more information on the website where you can figure out how many you want to new and here's the most important thing of
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.660]  All the 30-day money-back guarantee. So buy one see if it works
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:01.620]  you've got 30 days to just put it back in the box send it back to them no questions asked and
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:07.580]  It'll be done. Here's what you do to find out more. You've got to remember this promo code
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:14.460]  It's the talk show the talk show. Just go to eero.com eero.com and it check out
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:19.500]  You select overnight shipping and that code the talk show gets you overnight shipping
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.180]  So depending on what time of day you're listening to me tell you this you could have it by tomorrow
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.540]  for free
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.100]  Shipping wise so go check them out eero.com
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.100]  So
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:36.580]  I say coincidental because one of the products Google announced at their event was called Google Wi-Fi
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:42.520]  Which is a thing that works a lot like sounds like it works a lot like eero where you can buy more than one
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520]  of these things
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:49.000]  You spread them around their house and it gives you Wi-Fi and it does all the negotiation for you
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.760]  right
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.840]  And
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.360]  As I watch that part of the presentation
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.120]  I've been thinking it ever since ero sponsored the show but watching Google say it is I began thinking, you know
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:07.280]  It has been I don't remember the last time Apple has said a damn word about Airport and Airport is
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.880]  Seems like it's like outdated
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.520]  Yeah, exactly. I mean I I did the same thing
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:19.360]  I bought a pack of euros and or ero ero is it singular has what's the plural? I don't know
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:26.720]  I'm gonna call him eros. I'm gonna ero. Okay, like get back a wild ero a murder of eros and
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.720]  I
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.480]  Installed them and I like them a lot. I mean they generally cover well
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:40.360]  they cover areas of my house where I did not have coverage before even like I configured a handful of other extenders like
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:46.120]  You know an express attached to my extreme and you know, blah blah blah, right?
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:51.360]  And none of those seem to work as well as the ero so you can just extend your ero spot, I guess
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.840]  It's conversation. Like I like it
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:00.200]  I like the concept a lot and yeah, Apple hasn't done a whole lot with that and it does seem like a very Apple like concept
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200]  oh, just unplug this in and
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.820]  Use an iPhone app and you're done right and like that's like I could see an Apple version of that
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.580]  Where you take it out of the box and you plug it in and your iPhone sees it over Bluetooth
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:17.100]  You know le and says like oh, hey, do you want to set up your Wi-Fi now and you hit?
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.780]  Yes, like the air pod connect thing
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:19.140]  Yeah
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:24.240]  you know when you flip flip up in the air pod case it pops up with a little white card and I could totally see like
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.300]  It makes little sense to have an Apple system that works just like that
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:32.260]  But if they don't and it's still very complex and the airport
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.700]  Utility is not user friendly and doesn't work at the time
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.740]  So it was so much better than what you used to be before
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:47.260]  you know if you were using like a Cisco or you know net gear or something like that, but it by today's standards and compared to
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:48.940]  You know AirPods a perfect example
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:52.480]  You just open the case and you're not like it's like you're not picking like which
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:57.100]  Gigahertz Bluetooth to use which one is the least noise you're not picking, you know
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:03.600]  like the way that with Airport you're still supposed to pick between 5 gigahertz and 2.5 gigahertz and pick a channel and
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.380]  You don't have to do why do you have to do any of this?
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:12.420]  Why can't the software just figure it out and it seems like you know, that's certainly where era went and and that's seems like
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.420]  That's the exact description for Google Wi-Fi
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:20.100]  Mm-hmm. The thought I had though is that right after Google Wi-Fi they announced the Google
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:24.520]  What's it called the the thing that you talk to home? Yeah, Google home
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:30.780]  I don't understand why those are separate products or at least why can't Google how I understand that you wouldn't want to buy separate
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.920]  Google homes to be the pods that extend the Wi-Fi
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.900]  But it seems to me like there were two teams that weren't talking to each other
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:43.740]  That should have been talking to each other because maybe like you're you're one, you know base station should be the Google home
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.660]  yeah, I think the two teams thing is probably right, but I also think that they're they're aiming that as
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:57.380]  They're aiming that to be a product that people purchase that already have Wi-Fi routers and not really looking to buy new ones
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:02.460]  I think that I could conceivably see the technology being built in into in the future where it's like
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:05.340]  Oh, hey, if you get a Google home, guess what? It'll act as a Google Wi-Fi
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.140]  Yeah add on two more and you'll be golden, but I don't think that that was their
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.020]  MVP. Yeah, the other thought that occurred to me after I thought about it
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.300]  That was my first impression is why are they showing me two white boxes that you plug in and you know, right?
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.060]  right, the other thought that occurred to me is
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:27.300]  Not just in my house, but I think at most people's houses you might want to put them in very different spots
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:32.240]  It seems like the Alexa type devices or the echo type devices
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:38.060]  A lot of people put them in the kitchen for obvious reasons or they might put them. Yeah mines on my bar
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.260]  Good sounds like a good location
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:46.900]  And that's not necessarily where your cable connection is coming in where you could plug it into
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.580]  You know by Ethernet to just to get it the basic
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.980]  You know internet signal to begin with which is probably in your living room
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.580]  Mm-hmm. Yeah
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.580]  So I could see that
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.820]  I know that makes some sense. Do you think Apple is going to have something along these lines?
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.500]  Yeah, of course. I
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:08.420]  Wonder how they're gonna do it and I wonder how imminent it is
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:14.940]  Because at this point at this point now that it was later than next year. I would be shocked. All right
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.700]  I'm thinking I don't think it's this year. I don't think it's this year either
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:26.420]  I think it may be maybe like a March thing next year where there's already rumors that there's gonna be new iPads in March
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.420]  right
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:32.380]  Yeah, that makes some sense. I mean we got a you know, if you look
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:36.220]  So many of the Macs haven't been updated in so many years that you know
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:40.340]  later this year's got to be Mac time later this month maybe even but the
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.380]  That's all the rumors, you know
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:49.300]  But I don't see that it's kind of packed to put it in here and I really see them setting it up in
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:56.820]  in spring and then selling it into summer and then it becomes like the big Christmas item because it's like
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:00.420]  Oh, you have an iPhone this works great with that or you know, whatever the case may be
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:05.700]  Yeah, and you know, they're obviously not going to be first echo is gonna get credit for being first
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.620]  Apple's often first, you know, it's you know
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:14.660]  You know depending on how your perception of what a smartphone is
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:20.660]  They were either very late to smartphones or or they were the first one to come out with the first real smartphone
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.140]  Right and maybe I'll tell you
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:27.340]  Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, I just think that you know
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.180]  It looks weird though now that they're behind more than one company in this regard
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.340]  yeah, well, I
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:41.880]  Can say that I think that and I think you can say if you had the same experience or maybe a different one than
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.540]  Me, but I'll tell you Siri works a hell of a lot better when it can hear you
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:50.200]  And the iPhone is not a good listening device
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.860]  at all like
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:59.420]  Really bad unless it's really quiet, which is why people there's all these jokes about Siri not understanding you and blah blah blah
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:05.260]  But like, you know Apple built their own voice team because they weren't really happy with the way that the voice was being interpreted
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:11.020]  By this nuance, which is what they were using. So I built their own team. They made their own software and
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:18.860]  When you couple that with four microphones like with the air pods and you have two sets of beam forming
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.500]  You know lightly beam forming microphones
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:28.840]  Combined with a little bit of you know, bone conduction a little bit of accelerometer to say oh your jaws moving, you know
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:34.780]  It's vibrating you're talking like these signals that it's picking up and saying hey, you're talking to you. Let's go, right?
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:41.060]  Let me listen carefully and let me filter out the yield of noise and cancel all that out. It is really reliable
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.980]  I mean like the Siri commands that I give through my air pods are
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:49.600]  Incredibly rarely misinterpreted, you know, what happens after that is a whole nother conversation, right?
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:54.700]  But the actual picking up of the voice is very good and that's the echoes secret sauce
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:57.060]  It has seven microphones in it
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:03.580]  It's you know beam forms those the audio coming in to isolate that audio from other audio
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:10.100]  Which is why I can understand my kid, you know, and why I can understand me from over facing away from it
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.120]  Well, it took towards the stove away from it in the you know
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.480]  Kitchen of 15 feet away and they it still picks it up just fine and starts my timer, you know
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.480]  So I think that there's like some technological advancements there that will make Siri, you know
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:30.360]  Kind of react and be more responsive that I think people aren't, you know picking up on quite yet, but will once it launches
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:37.200]  But if that that's got to be like you if you ask echo if you ask Alexa or the echo
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.360]  Something and she doesn't get it or she doesn't hear you you feel like a dope
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.360]  Right, like you feel like a real idiot like talking to nothing when nothing responds
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:52.400]  so like the adoption of these things is really going to depend on them answering you because the moment that sort of
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.800]  Suspension of disbelief, you know that you've got a person on the other end of that
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.240]  Artificial intelligence that wants to talk to you is broken
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.000]  It makes you feel dumb and people don't like to feel that way
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.400]  So I think that once you have hardware that can really with a concrete surety pick you up
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.400]  Listen to you and at least give you some response even to say oh, I can't help you
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:19.400]  You know, I think it's definitely gonna be interesting and I think that's gonna be a good thing
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:26.000]  You know, I think it's definitely gonna be interesting and I think that Apple has some stuff to offer there that isn't yet public
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:32.100]  You know, I I think that there are components of Siri that people have not seen because Apple has chosen not to expose them
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.840]  That will be very surprising
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.280]  When they are actually, you know rolled out or made available
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600]  That sounds to me like you know something
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.440]  I don't know nothing John. I
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.080]  Have to say I it's funny because I could talk to you because you and I both have at least
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.160]  quote-unquote
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:53.720]  pre-production
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.900]  AirPods so we can compare and everybody else is still left to speculate on what the experience is
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.440]  like the longer I go with them the more I love them and
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.280]  I do miss having
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.940]  Playback controls on a thing that I can like triple click to like fast forward 30 seconds or something like that
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.220]  But not too much and
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:18.820]  You can use Siri to say next track and it works really well and there is a delay
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.620]  It takes a little bit longer than is clicking a button
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:28.020]  But not so much that I mind it. The one thing I miss on the AirPods compared to
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:35.220]  My either any previous headphones I've had that have had some kind of controls on the wires is the volume control
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:40.220]  Because you can't you have to use your phone to do the volume or your watch
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:45.820]  You can't even use Siri like I tried it you double tap and said Siri turn it up two clicks
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.820]  And she says I can't do that for you
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:54.620]  If you have an if you're an Apple watch where and you have your Apple watch on it's and I always do when I go running
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:59.500]  You start to get used to that and it's like that's where you go to the but even there
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.740]  It's like if I'm listening to overcast
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:08.020]  It's like when I first turn my watch up, I've got the workout app is going and I've got a tap a couple time
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.820]  You know, I've got to tap the side button to get to the playback controls
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:15.620]  so you can't just go to the watch and tap tap to make it louder because a
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.980]  You know, I'm in a noisy part of the city and there's more traffic
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:24.940]  But no other than the volume control. I like the AirPods better than my any previous
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.340]  Headphones that I've used with my phone in every single regard
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:33.780]  Yeah, it's great. I mean the obviously the number one question is always does it fall out and the answer is no and people refuse to
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.940]  Believe you because there's just nothing to pull them out, right? There's no mass. There's no cord attached
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.060]  You know, they they have little very little mass themselves and even when I get sweaty, you know
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:50.380]  You don't run on the treadmill or whatever. It doesn't you know, it's fine. They stay I wouldn't recommend them as workout earbuds
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:53.260]  That's why they have the beats, right? But they are pretty good
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.180]  And so I know some I have a friend who's been using the AirPods
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:42:01.220]  They're pretty good. And so I know some I have a friend who's like in love with the AirPods, right?
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:05.380]  He's like before the AirPods no headphones fit my ears, right?
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:09.860]  And you know, maybe he's weird and maybe we're all not weird or whatever, but he loves them
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:15.780]  So he's like super super stoked to get the the AirPods because he loves the shape
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:22.340]  But I have people talk to me on the exact opposite spectrum where they just don't fit their ears at all
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:28.620]  You know, they the AirPods the regular AirPods and I'm like I tell them flat-out look if those don't fit your ears
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:33.540]  You know, these are not gonna fit either, you know, so don't go there
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:37.740]  It's just not worth it right now whether you're spending the money or try them on or whatever
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.460]  You know here try these on but other than that fit question
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:48.020]  Like most people just are really excited and I honestly have not a whole lot of bad things to say they're loud
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:55.340]  They're crisp, but like they sound good. I think personally the sound quality is a little bit better than you know an AirPod
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.580]  And yeah
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:03.700]  I agree with you the volume and forward and back track controls are my biggest peeve and if they could find a way to do
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.700]  That with touch I would be I would be set
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:06.460]  Yeah
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:13.620]  Like if they could do it keep the double-click first Siri and maybe let let you assign triple and quadruple
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:19.620]  Tap, I don't know. I think like a single tap and hold maybe if they can detect a hold. I don't know, you know
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:23.300]  Like if they could detect. Oh, you didn't release your finger from it
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.740]  It seems like they could but that's as of the accelerometer
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:30.980]  But it's the only loss for me or only con for me and and your mileage is gonna vary on fit
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:32.020]  I don't know what to tell you
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.060]  But if you know, I'm with you if you if you either
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:42.620]  Can abide by the wired earbud AirPods from Apple or you even like them? You're gonna love the AirPods
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:44.740]  Mm-hmm, and it's like
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:51.620]  It's like the idea I'm at the point already where the idea of having a wire connecting my headphones to my phone
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:56.460]  It seems preposterous. Oh my god, it feels so annoying. It's so annoying
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:00.100]  It's like so I have the Bluetooth
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.540]  I have a Bluetooth set of beats the over ears
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:09.220]  That I noise cancellation that I've used for airplane flights and then I have the Bose like the you know
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:15.620]  Quite see 25. Yeah the QC QC 25 whatever they are right the quiet comforts and which are nice
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:22.220]  And then I have a set of wireless Jaybird x2s, which technically still have a wire between them
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:26.860]  But that the workout ones kind of like the beats configuration, you know the workout. Yeah, but the Jaybirds are great
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:32.780]  They're like a really great set of workout your wireless earbuds, but the way that these work
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:38.140]  I mean even though other ones the other stuff that goes in your ear. I have never been true, you know hugely fun
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.700]  I have a pair of those hears. I don't know if you're familiar
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:44.420]  startup called here and
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.380]  Aren't I think just here like HEA are okay and the
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.620]  the startup is it's not a headphone it's a
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:45:00.660]  Microphone that takes the audio coming in and filters it for you. So it's like
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:09.260]  Augmented ears like cyborg ears. So you plug them in they have a little microphone on the outside and they grab the sound and
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.020]  Process it and put it into your ears
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:17.940]  so like let's say you go to a concert and you want to turn down the volume you put your ears in and you just
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:23.620]  Grab your iPhone and go doo doo doo doo doo and it turns on the exterior volume. It's pretty wild. That's crazy
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:25.100]  Oh, no, I love them
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:28.380]  I mean, it's like you if you're at a place where like, you know
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:32.140]  I got I went to see Hamilton right and I got stuck up on the rafters like everybody
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:36.140]  But I just got really lucky and got a affordable ticket before it really exploded
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:40.620]  But you could you put those things in and you can just you could filter out the people around you
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.220]  Because they're talking quieter and just pick up the louder noises
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:48.640]  Which is the people, you know speaking from the stage and it feels like they're right in front of you
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.740]  It's actually a pretty crazy cool technology
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:56.600]  But those are the the ones that I've had the most experience with just sitting in the ear and I can tell you they feel
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.740]  Like you feel them right there there, you know, and maybe they'll get lighter and better over time. This is just a start-up, but
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:05.700]  The air pods are totally different bag because they're so light
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.060]  They're so, you know, they're not even there
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:13.360]  you really forget you're wearing them and it's just throwing those in picking them out of the case and throwing them in is just
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:19.740]  The amount of freedom there is is insane. It's really nice and the battery life is for me has been amazing. I
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:26.580]  I almost never remember to charge the damn thing and the case was still at 28% and the headphones were at
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:33.580]  100% so anyway, can't wait for everybody else to get them. But I really the longer I use them the more big a fan I am
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.980]  Before we wrap up anything else you want to talk about do you want to do you want a quick drop your guesses to who's
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.980]  Gonna buy Twitter
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:49.660]  Yeah, I mean there's there's an equal so we reported that Disney was looking right so we we asked around and we heard yeah
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.260]  Yes, Disney is looking at it and has been looking at it for a while
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.660]  We were we were pretty close on doing it and then I think Bloomberg or somebody scooped us, but that's fine
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.600]  You know stuff happens
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.240]  But anyhow, we heard it the Disney side of thing is like there's a lot of pluses and negatives
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:08.020]  And it's just like worlds collide for me, right? Cuz I'm a huge
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:12.340]  Fan of the company, you know what they've done in in historical
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.880]  Methodology these days that can't be a fan because I'm we report on various aspects of the company
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.260]  So more just like it, you know fascinated with it, right?
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.860]  but I am fascinated with a lot of aspects of that company from you know, they're the movies to the to the
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:34.380]  TV business to the parks and and on so on and so forth, right, but I think that it's
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.340]  There's some real easy
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:42.820]  Alignments and there's some real hard cliffs. Yes to that happening
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:45.140]  And I just don't know which one would win out
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:49.940]  You know the biggest the biggest one which we I mentioned in our story about it. Was it
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.500]  Twitter is supposed to be agnostic
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:59.980]  It when it comes to media companies right aside from special deals like they cut with NFL or whatever to broadcast stuff
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:03.240]  But they're supposed to be like, oh, hey, we did this with the NFL we can do with you, too
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.420]  But Disney is a huge media company
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.660]  so if they buy Twitter are
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:13.800]  they isolating it from the rest of the media landscape and that's probably the biggest like
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.040]  And check in the night column
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:23.760]  I've been saying for years that one of the most amazing things about Twitter that I think people overlook is how ubiquitous the IDs are
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:29.040]  For people who are famous like if you watch sports or you watch news
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.680]  And I watch both sports and especially an election year
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.880]  I watch the news when people come on to commentate on you know
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:40.120]  Who won the debate or who what do you think about Buck Showalter not putting Zach Britton in the game?
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.200]  Yeah, they tell you the Twitter name of everybody who's on TV
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.000]  They'll say, you know, here's Jimmy Rollins for you know, former shortstop
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.200]  Here's his Twitter name. Everybody's Twitter name is up there
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:59.240]  Does that happen does does TNT sports put the Twitter handles up for these people when Twitter's owned by the company that also owns?
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.400]  ESPN
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.400]  Yeah, right exactly
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:07.040]  You know and that's a lot of the you know, that's a lot of the value in Twitter to me
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.200]  I don't know quite how you connect that ubiquity and this sort of this is the default, you know
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:18.760]  Facebook would love to have that but they don't like the Twitter at names is a huge thing and it's a way to say
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.640]  Hey, if you want to connect to this person online you do it on Twitter
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.240]  That's a huge part of the value
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.100]  I don't know how you quite connect it to making money, but it certainly is part of the value because to me
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.340]  Fundamentally the thing that's valuable is attention
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:38.960]  I you know, I've this is the central John Gruber central theory of the media. Is that attention?
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:45.740]  Attention more than money is that is the foundation currency because it's the one thing that there's a limit to each person
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:51.600]  Multiplied by the number of hours a day that they're awake. That's the total amount of attention that's possible
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:55.340]  Twitter has a lot of it and yeah, I
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:01.280]  Don't know how you connect it to monetization, but it's got to be possible and I could see Disney doing it
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:07.240]  but I do I have the same fear as you where I feel like they could they could kill the golden goose because
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:13.900]  Just by buying it. It takes away the ubiquity of the presence that people have
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:20.320]  yeah, the funny thing is is that Twitter shot itself in the foot from almost day one by
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:28.540]  Obeying the industry's metrics. Yeah by by treating the MAU as the god of all
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.340]  This product decisions and and data and if it had
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.100]  Realized or recognized or embraced early on
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:44.860]  its nature as a place for people to have a strong identity and to contribute to a
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.700]  conversation
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.700]  but also a place that
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:55.160]  Welcomes passive viewership and it's doing that now are trying to reposition itself as that now
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.920]  But it's hard to do that right? You can't you got to sell an advertiser on the fact that okay
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.400]  We only have 300 or 280 million users or whatever
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.440]  But those 280 million users are creating
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.600]  You know a billion users worth of content, right?
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:16.360]  and and that it's hard to like sell that as a package if you have it if that hasn't been your
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:23.200]  Your premise from the beginning and that's it's rough. You know, you you're you're treating these logged out users
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.560]  Trying to now say hey
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:32.820]  These are value like the viewer on ESPN who's seeing the tweet like that's still value, right?
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.520]  It's still attention and still all that stuff
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.200]  But yeah
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:43.160]  you know monetization is a huge problem there because it's like how do you connect those disparate entities beyond ad tracking and and that
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:44.680]  sort of thing
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:50.560]  But I've always felt strongly that that Twitter's biggest play should have been around identity
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:58.020]  Mm-hmm, you know because like what do your identity online used to be if you were an quote-unquote online person
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:01.680]  It used to be your URL, right? Like if you were
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:08.480]  early early to the internet you had an email address and a URL or you know one or the other or both and
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:16.400]  Today almost nobody has a URL because creating websites is sort of like too much effort, right?
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:20.880]  It's too much anxiety to maintain and expensive and everything else instead
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:28.040]  there's so many services that cover so many millions or billions of people that you can create an identity by simply signing up for one
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:34.300]  Like Twitter and saying this is my identity and there are people like that on Facebook, but they're it's much rarer
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:41.080]  Than on Twitter like if you google almost anybody's name that has any sort of basic activity on Twitter
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:44.440]  Their Twitter handle is gonna give you everything you need to know about them
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.560]  Probably you know in in at a glance
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.680]  Like where they work. What do they do? What do they tweet about all day? What do they talk? What are they?
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.200]  What are their interests?
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.040]  You know, what are they interested in where they don't understand?
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:02.060]  You could go one level deeper look at their faves to see kind of what their tastes are in humor or in
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:06.160]  You know in news or you know, whatever right or who they follow etc
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.940]  But no other network on the planet offers that Facebook doesn't offer that because it was based
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:14.940]  it was its core base was like
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:20.540]  Oh networks of people who already know each other and Twitter is like networks of people that that you're strangers
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.040]  You know that don't know each other
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:26.460]  until you do until you look at their profile and all of a sudden you get a at least a basic picture of who
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.780]  They are and that that play I think is very interesting and that's something that Disney
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:35.260]  I think actually has a better ability to understand than a lot of the other buyers
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:41.740]  Who might want to treat it more of like a marketing channel, you know or attack that angle of it?
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:46.420]  Which I don't think is as strong for Twitter's future and I'm not as bullish about that. Yeah, I agree
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:53.660]  I I don't quite see the all the dots that connect from here to there where where Twitter is a thriving
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:56.180]  Disney property, but I I
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.660]  Mind to it if my intuition says that there is a path
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:02.520]  I don't know I can't describe it in detail
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.700]  But my intuition says that there's a path there and that you know may and they you know
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:13.620]  Obviously they could screw it up in a hundred different ways, but that there's potential there that I I'm more optimistic than just about anybody
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:17.260]  else who's about Disney owning Twitter than just about anybody else who's been named and
[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:24.340]  I almost feel like it would be better than Twitter remaining independent at this point because it seems like Twitter
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:27.740]  I don't think that's an option to be honest. No, I really don't at this point
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.180]  And you know
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.700]  We'll see I think but it smells like it's gonna happen soon
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:41.260]  It just seems like boy there's an I see reports every couple days about progress being made on this and action on Twitter's board part
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:46.980]  On a part of Twitter's board to start, you know, listening to bids and doing the math and stuff like that
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:50.080]  right, I think that what you end up with is you have
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:55.220]  you have the monetary or the math side of things then you have the
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.860]  The how does it fit like is it a distraction?
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:04.820]  All right, because when you're a company as big as Disney and you have a big pot of money to play with or debt
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.080]  You know that you can borrow on
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:12.580]  To to kind of buy what you want and make your own choose your own destiny
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:19.100]  It at some point becomes a question of is this additive or is it subtractive? Like is it a distraction?
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.900]  We sure we could buy it we can afford it
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:26.600]  It makes some sense as a holistic business and we see how we can maybe make a little bit better better business of it
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:32.020]  but is it a distraction and one of the like one of the things that I like to look at in
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:37.740]  Historically with Disney is their purchase of the channel that would become ABC Family
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:42.200]  Which was a disaster like it was a boondoggle from the beginning
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.620]  right like the from the moment the hands were shook and in Sun Valley to you know
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:52.900]  The six times it was reprogrammed to try and be like, oh this is we're gonna aim it at girls
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.100]  We're gonna aim it at tweens
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.940]  We're gonna aim it at you know, 25 to 35 we're gonna you know
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:03.660]  All of these reprogramming and stuff is just a huge boondoggle to try to get that thing successful and they they just really went
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:11.460]  Wrong, like from the very beginning and it was a distraction and they could have probably created it wholesale, you know
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.780]  It's just a cable channel and it costs so much
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:18.140]  angst and firings and you know attention
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:23.820]  Subtracted from the rest of the business and that I think is the equation that goes through their head when they look at something like
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.700]  Twitter it's like yeah, it's cool. It's interesting
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:32.220]  It's a property that has a very extremely, you know unique amongst all other internet properties
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:37.020]  Value, but is it a distraction for us and if the answer is yes
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:40.820]  It's better not to do it. Even if all other things said it's
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:43.460]  interesting by
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:48.740]  It also occurs to me when Disney in their properties start getting into
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:51.940]  Technology
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.580]  Is it occurs to me this anecdote I linked to it
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.620]  I forget when I linked to it as a while ago, but here's somebody who's referencing my link to it
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.660]  Looks like it was back in 2011
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:05.940]  From a book about
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:09.780]  Inside ESPN those guys have all the fun inside the world of ESPN
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:13.660]  The story goes to the ESPN president George Bodenheimer attended the first
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:21.900]  Disney board meeting in Orlando, Florida just after the company had bought Pixar the innovative animation factory and he spotted Apple CEO Steve Jobs
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.380]  In a hallway, it seemed like a good time to introduce himself. Hi. I'm George Bodenheimer. He said to jobs
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:33.260]  I run ESPN Jobs just looked at him and said nothing other than your phone is the dumbest fucking idea
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:35.260]  I've ever heard turned and walked away
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:43.620]  Yeah, that's a great one I love that link they've got a picture to it it was in fact tying things together
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.620]  It was a Samsung phone
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:47.660]  Of course it was
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.820]  All
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:51.780]  Right, we got sick. We got baseball to watch
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:57.280]  We've yeah, the short episode has gone an hour and 48 minutes anything else you wanted to mention before we drop off
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:02.500]  No, I'm good. I'm good. I can just tell you I've I've made last-minute
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:08.220]  Can you do my show requests to people before and but never as last-minute as literally this one was and I?
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:10.940]  Can't tell you how much I appreciate your time
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:15.700]  But it's also too perfect. I just feel like it was a perfect week to have you on so I
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:21.580]  I thank you Matthew people can forget all the panzerino they want at TechCrunch where he's
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:24.520]  Kicking ass with these scoops and then on Twitter
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:27.780]  How do you spell your Twitter handle?
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:35.860]  Panzer pan zer even though your real surname is spelled with an a in there, but yes figure it out
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:40.020]  Yeah, it's extremely confusing people will figure it out. So my thanks to you and my thanks to
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:43.960]  The terrific sponsors we had this week. We had fracture
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:46.520]  Go get your pictures printed on glass
