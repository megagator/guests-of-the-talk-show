[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  I'm thinking about setting up a business unlocking iPhones.
[00:04.080 --> 00:05.000]  It's easy, I hear.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.600]  Yeah.
[00:06.600 --> 00:07.800]  Wow, it's going nuts, though.
[00:07.800 --> 00:08.400]  You know what?
[00:08.400 --> 00:11.920]  It's like, and I kind of feel like I kind of called it,
[00:11.920 --> 00:14.320]  where it's like, I mean, I don't think this was very hard.
[00:14.320 --> 00:17.720]  It wasn't like I'm the only one who made a unique observation,
[00:17.720 --> 00:22.240]  but that it's far from a slam dunk,
[00:22.240 --> 00:26.480]  because it's largely, at least so far,
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.680]  being tried in a court of public opinion,
[00:28.680 --> 00:31.640]  not in a court of law.
[00:31.640 --> 00:32.320]  Except for today.
[00:32.320 --> 00:35.960]  Yeah, so it's actually like late breaking news.
[00:35.960 --> 00:36.920]  Can you explain this?
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.680]  I think you're probably better informed than I am.
[00:39.680 --> 00:43.360]  Well, I wouldn't say that.
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.720]  In another case, not the one that is really
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.560]  at the forefront of all this, a federal judge in Brooklyn
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.960]  today ruled that the government could not force
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.880]  Apple to unlock a phone, an iPhone.
[00:56.880 --> 01:00.240]  And it was, I guess, that they, again,
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.400]  was this publicized at all?
[01:01.400 --> 01:04.440]  Do we know that this case was coming, or just drop out
[01:04.440 --> 01:05.440]  of the thin air?
[01:05.440 --> 01:09.080]  Well, I mean, they had talked about several other cases
[01:09.080 --> 01:16.960]  in which not necessarily the FBI, but other district
[01:16.960 --> 01:19.960]  attorneys and other jurisdictions,
[01:19.960 --> 01:22.200]  they were trying to get Apple to unlock phones in order
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.040]  to get information for not necessarily
[01:25.040 --> 01:28.640]  terrorism-related cases, but just like racketeering, drugs,
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.720]  whatever, I mean like a whole bunch of different things.
[01:30.720 --> 01:32.080]  Right, and so this one, this New York case.
[01:32.080 --> 01:34.000]  So let's just call it by the location, right?
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.800]  We'll say this is the New York case,
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.240]  and the other one's the San Bernardino case.
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.440]  So this is different.
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.600]  And one of the ways it's different is it's a drug case,
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.200]  so it's not terrorism.
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.440]  Which doesn't really, shouldn't really change the law,
[01:51.440 --> 01:57.040]  but it absolutely changes the amount of radioactive publicity
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.520]  around this.
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.440]  You know, like you say there's a guy in Brooklyn who's
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.560]  up on drug charges, and everybody is like, OK.
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.240]  Oh, it's Tuesday.
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.120]  And then you say a bunch of a Muslim couple
[02:15.120 --> 02:19.080]  committed an act of terrorism and shot up 14,
[02:19.080 --> 02:21.640]  killed 14 people, and shot up 22 others.
[02:21.640 --> 02:24.560]  And it's terrorism, and then people are, you know.
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.240]  And again, I'm not even making fun of it.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.560]  It's a natural reaction.
[02:27.560 --> 02:29.360]  It is, that's shocking.
[02:29.360 --> 02:31.560]  And it is, you know.
[02:31.560 --> 02:34.280]  Yeah, and I mean, as far as I know in this drug case,
[02:34.280 --> 02:35.840]  nobody was killed.
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.720]  I mean, maybe somebody was killed in relation
[02:39.720 --> 02:42.200]  to this guy, whoever the defendant is dealing
[02:42.200 --> 02:44.200]  is that I don't actually know.
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.640]  But it certainly wasn't a case where 14 people were killed.
[02:46.640 --> 02:48.560]  Right, but in terms of the legal question
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.560]  of whether the United States federal law as it stands today
[02:53.560 --> 02:57.600]  can result in the Department of Justice
[02:57.600 --> 03:01.360]  getting a court order to force Apple or any other company
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.920]  to write new code for their devices
[03:03.920 --> 03:06.840]  to comply with the law, I don't think it's any different.
[03:06.840 --> 03:09.800]  There's nothing magical about terrorism
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.080]  that's different than drugs in terms of can Apple
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.400]  be compelled to do this.
[03:14.400 --> 03:16.880]  And the judge in this case, what's his name?
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.080]  James Orenstein.
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.600]  It seems, I didn't read his order yet.
[03:19.600 --> 03:20.880]  It's too late breaking it.
[03:20.880 --> 03:22.720]  It's a 50-page thing.
[03:22.720 --> 03:24.480]  But there are some highlights that came out.
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.720]  He really seems to have ripped the feds a new one.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.520]  He really did it.
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.440]  What's the one that Matthew, our friend Matthew Panzareno.
[03:33.440 --> 03:34.880]  Friend of the show, Matthew Panzareno.
[03:34.880 --> 03:35.720]  Friend of the show.
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.600]  I mean, all this stuff gets down to this all writs act,
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.400]  which we have become familiar with, of course.
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.720]  You know what, we laugh.
[03:49.720 --> 03:52.720]  Since we've done our crash course as constitutional law
[03:52.720 --> 03:53.440]  experts.
[03:53.440 --> 03:55.000]  We laugh.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.240]  One of the things I've seen, and I do appreciate,
[03:57.240 --> 04:00.160]  I appreciate that there are people who feel otherwise.
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.140]  And it seems to me like most people who read Daring
[04:03.140 --> 04:04.600]  Fireball and listen to the show, I
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.040]  thought before the last episode I did with Dalrymple,
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.400]  I thought that most people probably agreed
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.200]  with what I think.
[04:11.200 --> 04:13.520]  And judging from the feedback I've seen, they do.
[04:13.520 --> 04:15.200]  But clearly not everybody does.
[04:15.200 --> 04:17.680]  And I'll even admit that that's, I don't agree,
[04:17.680 --> 04:20.120]  but it's nice to have a reasonable disagreement
[04:20.120 --> 04:22.800]  with people about politics.
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.400]  That no, this isn't the world we want to live in.
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.160]  We really should have something where the cops can get
[04:28.160 --> 04:30.000]  into a phone if they need to.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.240]  OK.
[04:32.240 --> 04:35.720]  But the question of whether this all writs act
[04:35.720 --> 04:37.880]  is the law that this should be based on.
[04:37.880 --> 04:41.320]  To me, even if you think that law enforcement should
[04:41.320 --> 04:43.840]  have some kind of technical way to get at a phone
[04:43.840 --> 04:45.720]  if they really need to.
[04:45.720 --> 04:48.360]  I really feel like it's almost, you
[04:48.360 --> 04:51.240]  can't debate that they should try to get a new law passed.
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.560]  Because the laws as they stand, there's
[04:54.560 --> 04:57.600]  just no way to get there from here.
[04:57.600 --> 04:58.640]  Yeah.
[04:58.640 --> 05:00.760]  Did you read the all writs act?
[05:00.760 --> 05:01.280]  No.
[05:01.280 --> 05:02.120]  I did.
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.040]  It's very short.
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.120]  It's extremely short.
[05:04.120 --> 05:06.080]  Well, I think that's part of the problem, which
[05:06.080 --> 05:06.800]  I've heard before.
[05:06.800 --> 05:09.080]  Yeah, it's very short.
[05:09.080 --> 05:14.000]  And it was written in 1789.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.080]  But it's not dense.
[05:16.080 --> 05:17.960]  The plain meaning of it, especially
[05:17.960 --> 05:20.120]  when you read what other people say about it,
[05:20.120 --> 05:23.000]  people who are more expert in constitutional law,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.520]  if they say that the whole point of the all writs act
[05:25.520 --> 05:27.240]  was this was right at the beginning
[05:27.240 --> 05:29.520]  of our federal government.
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.520]  The Constitution, the ink wasn't even dry on it.
[05:33.520 --> 05:34.680]  And this was a way.
[05:34.680 --> 05:38.320]  So the laws, all sorts of things, oh, we never
[05:38.320 --> 05:39.880]  thought of that, we better make a law.
[05:39.880 --> 05:42.360]  All those little things hadn't happened yet.
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.880]  The all writs act was passed as a sort of catch
[05:45.880 --> 05:49.880]  all for like, hey, if a case comes before you that
[05:49.880 --> 05:51.720]  falls between the cracks of the laws that
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.520]  hadn't been anticipated, this grants the courts a bit
[05:54.520 --> 06:01.560]  of leeway so they don't just shrug their shoulders.
[06:01.560 --> 06:04.120]  And it's really, really hard to see how that applies here,
[06:04.120 --> 06:05.520]  especially when so many laws have
[06:05.520 --> 06:08.960]  been passed about things like encryption and digital devices
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.560]  and stuff like that, that they easily
[06:11.560 --> 06:13.960]  could have if Congress had wanted to mandate something
[06:13.960 --> 06:15.200]  like this, easily could have.
[06:15.200 --> 06:18.000]  And in fact, there are laws on the books that actually
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.480]  stipulate the other way, that tech companies can't
[06:21.480 --> 06:24.480]  be compelled to do things.
[06:24.480 --> 06:26.320]  What was the, I had a link to it the other day
[06:26.320 --> 06:30.080]  on Daring Fireball, I forget the name of the act.
[06:30.080 --> 06:33.440]  I guess I could look it up.
[06:33.440 --> 06:37.120]  Do we have that capability?
[06:37.120 --> 06:42.040]  It's the CALEA Act, the Communications Assistance
[06:42.040 --> 06:43.320]  for Law Enforcement Act.
[06:43.320 --> 06:45.760]  So even just the name of that law
[06:45.760 --> 06:49.760]  really makes it clear that this is really something
[06:49.760 --> 06:50.920]  that's very, very close.
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.280]  And so here's the section of CALEA entitled
[06:54.280 --> 06:57.560]  Design of Features and Systems Configurations.
[06:57.560 --> 07:00.720]  The statute says it does not authorize any law enforcement
[07:00.720 --> 07:04.960]  agency or officer to require any specific design of equipment,
[07:04.960 --> 07:09.120]  facilities, services, features, or system configurations
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.480]  to be adopted by any provider of a wire or electronic
[07:13.480 --> 07:15.960]  communications service, any manufacturer
[07:15.960 --> 07:19.520]  of telecommunications equipment, or any provider
[07:19.520 --> 07:23.400]  of telecommunications support services.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.800]  And again, it's not just me.
[07:24.800 --> 07:27.080]  I'm not putting on my Scooby Doo hat here
[07:27.080 --> 07:29.280]  and doing some amateur lawyering.
[07:29.280 --> 07:31.440]  This is real legal experts are saying
[07:31.440 --> 07:37.920]  that this was something that Apple cited in their own motion
[07:37.920 --> 07:38.880]  to vacate the order.
[07:38.880 --> 07:40.120]  Apple is saying that.
[07:40.120 --> 07:43.480]  And I think that there might be some slight ambiguity there
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.840]  that maybe the law was kind of written with phone companies
[07:48.840 --> 07:53.360]  in mind, like AT&T, Verizon, and those type of people,
[07:53.360 --> 07:55.120]  not necessarily the handset maker.
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.680]  But I don't know.
[07:56.680 --> 07:58.760]  I mean, I think a plain reading of the law,
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.880]  telecommunications equipment and support, I mean,
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.440]  it's a cell phone.
[08:02.440 --> 08:04.040]  That's what an iPhone is.
[08:04.040 --> 08:07.200]  And that passage I just read very specifically
[08:07.200 --> 08:10.760]  seems to say you can't make them do things like this.
[08:10.760 --> 08:13.680]  You can get a warrant to investigate
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.480]  what they already have, but you can't make them do new things.
[08:17.480 --> 08:20.120]  Yeah.
[08:20.120 --> 08:25.200]  So here's the quote from Judge Ornstein and Matthew.
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.400]  So to reiterate for anybody who's following along
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.800]  and can't keep the name straight,
[08:28.800 --> 08:31.160]  this is the New York case that just broke today, Monday,
[08:31.160 --> 08:32.880]  29th of February.
[08:32.880 --> 08:34.720]  And this wasn't the one I was thinking of,
[08:34.720 --> 08:35.880]  but this one's good, too.
[08:35.880 --> 08:38.240]  I conclude that Apple's position is more consistent
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.320]  than the government's with the rule of statutory construction
[08:41.320 --> 08:45.760]  that requires giving meaning to all statutory words and clauses
[08:45.760 --> 08:48.280]  as well as the rules prohibiting interpretations that
[08:48.280 --> 08:54.000]  produce absurd results or are of suspect constitutionality.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.680]  Right, so in other words, I mean,
[08:55.680 --> 08:57.720]  it's actually kind of a good read.
[08:57.720 --> 08:59.320]  It's like dripping with sarcasm.
[08:59.320 --> 09:00.480]  I mean, he's more.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.400]  Yes, and the one that I remembered
[09:02.400 --> 09:05.080]  is there's another one that says something like it's basically
[09:05.080 --> 09:10.200]  to the effect of if the government's position is
[09:10.200 --> 09:12.400]  accurate, then there is nothing stopping the government
[09:12.400 --> 09:16.000]  from commanding someone to commit murder.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.560]  Right, we can command you to do whatever we need to get this.
[09:20.560 --> 09:24.440]  Here's this Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept
[09:24.440 --> 09:25.800]  has cited this passage.
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.300]  The judge also accused the government
[09:27.300 --> 09:30.200]  of trying to manipulate secret judicial proceedings
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.360]  to obtain powers for itself against Apple
[09:33.360 --> 09:36.600]  that public debate and Congress would never permit.
[09:36.600 --> 09:39.960]  It is, Judge Orenstein wrote, quote,
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.240]  clear that the government has made the considered decision
[09:43.240 --> 09:46.120]  that it is better off securing such crypto legislative
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.640]  authority from the courts in proceedings that had always
[09:50.640 --> 09:53.480]  been at the time it filed the instant application shielded
[09:53.480 --> 09:56.120]  from public scrutiny rather than taking the chance
[09:56.120 --> 09:59.520]  that open legislative debate might produce a result less
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.680]  to its liking, end quote.
[10:01.680 --> 10:03.840]  Back to Greenwald, because government wants the courts
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.400]  rather than Congress to grant this power, the, quote,
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.360]  government's interpretation of the breadth and authority
[10:10.360 --> 10:16.320]  of the All Writs Act confers on courts of limited jurisdiction
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.920]  raises serious doubts about how such a statute could withstand
[10:20.920 --> 10:23.480]  constitutional scrutiny under the separation of powers
[10:23.480 --> 10:24.960]  doctrine.
[10:24.960 --> 10:27.200]  So what he's more or less saying is there's just no way
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.280]  that, there's no way that by not having, you know,
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.000]  completely circumventing the legislature
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.500]  and doing this in secret through the courts, how in the world
[10:35.500 --> 10:38.520]  does that fit within our system?
[10:38.520 --> 10:40.560]  So I really, really think, I mean, as this goes on,
[10:40.560 --> 10:43.120]  and this, I mean, this is just devastating in my opinion.
[10:43.120 --> 10:45.800]  I mean, and it seems to me not just what I think,
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.080]  but you know, Greenwald's pretty smart on issues like this.
[10:50.080 --> 10:52.400]  It just seems like everybody who follows this stuff
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.040]  really sees this as a slam dunk case in Apple's favor.
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.520]  Yeah, well, this ruling is a slam dunk in Apple's favor,
[10:59.520 --> 10:59.920]  definitely.
[10:59.920 --> 11:01.080]  I mean, obviously, I think the government's
[11:01.080 --> 11:02.720]  going to appeal this, too, right?
[11:02.720 --> 11:03.360]  I guess.
[11:03.360 --> 11:05.400]  I can't imagine that they wouldn't.
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.880]  It seems like they would.
[11:06.880 --> 11:09.840]  So it's never, you know, it's never completely over
[11:09.840 --> 11:12.960]  until they've either capitulated or it's
[11:12.960 --> 11:14.080]  gone to the Supreme Court.
[11:14.080 --> 11:16.960]  I'm curious, I wonder when they filed this, because it's
[11:16.960 --> 11:19.400]  clearly not the, you know, so many of us
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.480]  have said that this San Bernardino
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.160]  phone is such a perfect example for the government,
[11:24.160 --> 11:26.240]  because it's, quote unquote, terrorism.
[11:26.240 --> 11:29.720]  And it was, I mean, it wasn't just like suspects.
[11:29.720 --> 11:32.400]  I mean, these are two people who actually shot and killed
[11:32.400 --> 11:33.080]  a bunch of people.
[11:33.080 --> 11:33.880]  I mean, it's true.
[11:33.880 --> 11:35.460]  You know, they actually committed it.
[11:35.460 --> 11:37.600]  It wasn't even like a, you know.
[11:37.600 --> 11:39.400]  Right, a plan.
[11:39.400 --> 11:41.800]  Right.
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.520]  And it just lends them so much more emotional and sort
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.680]  of, you know, in some ways, political weight
[11:51.680 --> 11:53.560]  behind their request that they don't have
[11:53.560 --> 11:55.720]  any case like this drug case.
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.020]  I mean, the terrorism stuff obviously
[11:59.020 --> 12:02.240]  brings out people's emotions a lot more.
[12:02.240 --> 12:03.600]  And again.
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.800]  Where some people think, I like drugs.
[12:07.800 --> 12:09.520]  But again, again.
[12:09.520 --> 12:11.680]  I would be lost without my drug dealer.
[12:11.680 --> 12:15.680]  Again, we laugh, but I think I speak for you that I also,
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.320]  though I see that, though, it's common sense
[12:19.320 --> 12:22.360]  that some portion of the public would see this differently.
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.600]  And it's not necessarily unreasonable.
[12:24.600 --> 12:26.560]  People, you know, I mean, it gets
[12:26.560 --> 12:29.000]  to the root of the real word terrorism,
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.760]  not the politicized one that is thrown about.
[12:31.760 --> 12:34.560]  But the real word, you know, that it strikes terror
[12:34.560 --> 12:35.080]  in people.
[12:35.080 --> 12:38.160]  And when you're terrorized, you know, you have a reaction.
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.640]  You're actually not, if you are terrorized,
[12:40.640 --> 12:43.160]  then you don't really, you know, you're like, ah, I'm cool.
[12:43.160 --> 12:45.080]  I'm scared out of my mind, but I'm cool.
[12:45.080 --> 12:46.200]  You're, you know, you're not hooked.
[12:46.200 --> 12:47.040]  There's something wrong with you.
[12:47.040 --> 12:47.880]  You're not hooked up.
[12:47.880 --> 12:48.800]  You're not hooked up.
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.720]  You're not hooked up.
[12:51.720 --> 12:53.360]  There's like evolutionary reasons
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.080]  why when you encounter a terrifying situation
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.760]  that your body, you know, reacts in a very quick and decided
[13:01.760 --> 13:03.000]  way.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.080]  You know, I find this argument about, I mean,
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.320]  it's an interesting argument about the idea
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.360]  that where this debate should take place.
[13:10.360 --> 13:12.760]  And it's just, you know, to put it
[13:12.760 --> 13:15.920]  into simple terms for stupid people like me,
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.040]  I had not seen the most recent Mission Impossible movie.
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.080]  And I just started watching it this afternoon.
[13:23.080 --> 13:25.560]  And then this came out, which is kind of funny
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.600]  because in the very beginning, they just banned the IMF,
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.120]  you know, the Impossible Missions Force,
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.440]  which is a completely unregulated organization that
[13:36.440 --> 13:38.280]  acts without any accountability whatsoever.
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.880]  It's like, and we're supposed to, you know,
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.400]  in watching the movie, kind of root for the people who have
[13:47.400 --> 13:49.680]  absolutely no accountability.
[13:49.680 --> 13:52.840]  Yeah, but even there, even with the IMF, and I like that movie.
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.240]  It's Rogue Nation, right?
[13:54.240 --> 13:55.200]  That's the name of it.
[13:55.200 --> 13:56.560]  I actually enjoyed that very much.
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.760]  I thought it was, it's funny, I don't want to do any spoilers,
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.080]  but there's actually a whole bunch of parallels to Spectre.
[14:03.080 --> 14:06.040]  It's almost uncanny how similar the two movies are.
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.720]  Like, the length to which you could draw, you know,
[14:09.720 --> 14:14.440]  create a, what do they call those, summaries, you know,
[14:14.440 --> 14:17.920]  like, you know, like when you're on Netflix
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.400]  and they give you like the quick summary.
[14:19.400 --> 14:19.880]  Oh, yeah.
[14:19.880 --> 14:22.520]  Like a half a review and half of a quick plot summary.
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.040]  Like you can go, you could go pretty far into detail
[14:25.040 --> 14:29.320]  and have it apply just as well to Rogue Nation as Spectre.
[14:29.320 --> 14:33.160]  I find that Rogue Nation was by far the better movie.
[14:33.160 --> 14:34.080]  That's my understanding.
[14:34.080 --> 14:35.520]  I have not seen, I've not seen Spectre yet.
[14:35.520 --> 14:37.960]  That is a subject for a different episode of the show.
[14:37.960 --> 14:39.120]  Yes, that's a different episode.
[14:39.120 --> 14:39.920]  I think it's great.
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.880]  But one difference is, at least with IMF, like, you know,
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.760]  Ethan Hunt would break into Apple and he would write,
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.160]  he would write the code himself, you know.
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.200]  He would, he would, well, Benji, Benji would write the code.
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.280]  Oh, yeah, Benji would write the code.
[14:54.280 --> 14:56.640]  But Ethan would break in and then he'd have glasses,
[14:56.640 --> 14:59.000]  you know, so that Benji could see what he's saying.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  And he would steal Apple's signing key and then, you know,
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.560]  but they would do all the work themselves
[15:05.560 --> 15:08.120]  and they would do so knowing that they're breaking the law
[15:08.120 --> 15:09.200]  to do it, right?
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.440]  And they would, you know, it's still different from this,
[15:13.440 --> 15:16.000]  which is really of this sort of compulsory,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.520]  we're gonna make you do what we tell you to do,
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.960]  even though you say we absolutely positive,
[15:20.960 --> 15:22.820]  we would never, what you're asking us to do
[15:22.820 --> 15:24.040]  is something we would never do.
[15:24.040 --> 15:25.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.480]  I mean, and it seems to me like there may be,
[15:29.480 --> 15:31.720]  I don't know, I mean, somebody like Rich Mogul
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.760]  would have a better idea than I would,
[15:32.760 --> 15:34.160]  but like, there may be a way
[15:34.160 --> 15:37.040]  that somebody super smart could do that.
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.560]  But that's not really what the point is here,
[15:40.560 --> 15:42.200]  that the point is to create legal precedent.
[15:42.200 --> 15:44.240]  Right, I am-
[15:44.240 --> 15:45.680]  They're not even trying.
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.320]  In the last week, I am,
[15:49.420 --> 15:52.000]  one of the things that's come up as this has gone on
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.360]  is more and more about how
[15:57.680 --> 15:59.520]  there's no way that Apple could create this
[15:59.520 --> 16:00.760]  and then destroy it.
[16:00.760 --> 16:02.140]  Well, I mean, technically, it's possible
[16:02.140 --> 16:03.720]  that they could create this, use it once,
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.480]  and then erase all traces of it and start over.
[16:08.800 --> 16:09.640]  But for any kind of,
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.960]  any case where they would need to show it in court,
[16:13.960 --> 16:15.520]  it has to be preserved.
[16:15.520 --> 16:17.200]  You can't have evidence that was generated
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.840]  using a tool that you've then destroyed
[16:18.840 --> 16:21.480]  because the defense has a right to inspect the tool.
[16:24.080 --> 16:26.420]  I know that, again, the slippery slope phrase,
[16:26.420 --> 16:28.180]  it's like you hear it over and over and over again
[16:28.180 --> 16:29.280]  and it starts to lose meaning,
[16:29.280 --> 16:31.360]  but I really feel like it's perfectly apt here,
[16:31.360 --> 16:33.840]  that you start down this path and it just leads,
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.400]  and you don't even know where it's gonna wind up.
[16:36.400 --> 16:38.200]  But the fact that you have to preserve tools
[16:38.200 --> 16:41.880]  that are used to generate evidence in a criminal case is,
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.840]  and rightly so, that's the way it should be,
[16:44.840 --> 16:47.240]  but it just shows that there's no way
[16:47.240 --> 16:49.640]  that they could create this and destroy it.
[16:49.640 --> 16:50.460]  Yeah.
[16:50.460 --> 16:52.500]  It's one of the ways that the San Bernardino case
[16:52.500 --> 16:53.340]  is a perfect storm,
[16:53.340 --> 16:54.960]  because I really don't think there is
[16:54.960 --> 16:56.920]  any kind of criminal case going on
[16:56.920 --> 16:58.480]  because the two suspects are dead.
[16:58.480 --> 16:59.680]  I mean, so-
[16:59.680 --> 17:01.240]  Yeah, right, what exactly?
[17:01.240 --> 17:02.920]  Yeah, I mean, they're not prosecuting anybody.
[17:02.920 --> 17:04.080]  But-
[17:04.080 --> 17:05.400]  They're looking for more people to prosecute.
[17:05.400 --> 17:10.400]  But what if they do find a text message on the phone
[17:10.560 --> 17:12.080]  and it's to somebody else,
[17:12.080 --> 17:13.760]  and they're like, well, we're gonna prosecute this guy?
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.320]  Well, now there is a lawsuit,
[17:15.320 --> 17:18.180]  and the way that they found the guy was using this tool.
[17:18.180 --> 17:19.960]  So even if there's no criminal case
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.600]  against the two shooters,
[17:23.440 --> 17:26.120]  the whole point of wanting to look at the phone
[17:26.120 --> 17:29.240]  on a surface is that they're looking for anybody else
[17:29.240 --> 17:31.880]  who they might have been conspiring with.
[17:31.880 --> 17:32.720]  Right.
[17:35.880 --> 17:38.080]  And what else is going on with this phone thing?
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.520]  A lot of bad commentary.
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.800]  I do find that,
[17:45.920 --> 17:48.460]  and again, I guess it's,
[17:48.460 --> 17:50.040]  well, one of the things that's interesting,
[17:50.040 --> 17:50.860]  I'll say this,
[17:50.860 --> 17:52.200]  one of the things that's interesting about it
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.240]  is that it doesn't fall neatly
[17:54.240 --> 17:56.740]  on the left-right political divide.
[17:56.740 --> 18:00.440]  And in general, the political right
[18:00.440 --> 18:02.760]  is a little bit more friendly to law enforcement,
[18:02.760 --> 18:05.680]  and the left is more friendly,
[18:05.680 --> 18:10.680]  or more in favor of civil rights and civil liberties.
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.760]  Right, so the ACLU is perceived,
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.240]  probably correctly so, as a left-leaning organization.
[18:19.540 --> 18:22.720]  And so, in some sense, this is definitely about,
[18:22.720 --> 18:24.640]  absolutely about civil liberties.
[18:24.640 --> 18:27.420]  That's Apple's entire defense, really.
[18:29.280 --> 18:30.320]  That if you would predict
[18:30.320 --> 18:31.760]  there's any kind of left-right split,
[18:31.760 --> 18:35.160]  it would be Democrats and left-leaning people
[18:35.160 --> 18:36.740]  siding with Apple and Republicans,
[18:36.740 --> 18:39.000]  and conservatives siding with...
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.560]  For the, yeah, for the most part.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.400]  But that's a really broad generalization,
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.400]  and a lot of conservatives are very libertarian-minded,
[18:48.260 --> 18:50.480]  and are suspicious of government.
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.320]  And...
[18:51.320 --> 18:52.240]  I bet those guys are those guys
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.720]  that took over that land in Portland, probably,
[18:54.720 --> 18:58.080]  are opposed to the FBI.
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.120]  It wasn't in Portland.
[18:59.120 --> 19:00.400]  Unlock smartphones.
[19:00.400 --> 19:02.680]  It was Oregon, it wasn't Portland.
[19:02.680 --> 19:03.520]  Did I say Portland?
[19:03.520 --> 19:04.900]  I meant Oregon.
[19:04.900 --> 19:05.740]  Whatever it is.
[19:05.740 --> 19:07.420]  Well, there's a big difference, though, that I'm...
[19:07.420 --> 19:08.880]  That would be pretty funny, though, definitely.
[19:08.880 --> 19:10.880]  Occupy Portland.
[19:10.880 --> 19:12.940]  Occupy like a hipster coffee shop.
[19:14.680 --> 19:16.520]  With a, just, roll...
[19:16.520 --> 19:18.440]  Really, a really nice Thai restaurant.
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.660]  Take over a food truck.
[19:19.660 --> 19:23.800]  We can't get rid of these guys.
[19:25.240 --> 19:27.360]  But they keep buying our expensive donuts.
[19:28.480 --> 19:29.800]  Really great sneakers.
[19:32.500 --> 19:34.560]  No, but I've seen an awful lot of people who,
[19:34.560 --> 19:35.760]  you know, who I follow on Twitter
[19:35.760 --> 19:38.480]  for other political reasons, who are, you know,
[19:38.480 --> 19:41.520]  and ordinarily would be on a Republican conservative side,
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.020]  and are, you know, very much in favor of Apple
[19:45.020 --> 19:45.860]  in this regard.
[19:45.860 --> 19:47.580]  And I've also seen a lot of them...
[19:47.580 --> 19:49.960]  I don't, I see the similarities.
[19:49.960 --> 19:51.820]  I almost don't want to open the door on this,
[19:51.820 --> 19:53.460]  but I've seen a lot, on conservatives,
[19:53.460 --> 19:57.680]  I've seen a lot of them compare it to gun ownership
[19:57.680 --> 20:02.680]  and gun control legislation.
[20:03.240 --> 20:05.700]  And I feel like that breaks down pretty quickly,
[20:05.700 --> 20:07.360]  but at the top level, I kind of see,
[20:07.360 --> 20:08.760]  I do kind of see what they're getting at.
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.620]  That there's this argument that the Second Amendment,
[20:10.620 --> 20:12.720]  at a very, very high level, that if you read it,
[20:12.720 --> 20:14.520]  it's, you know, it says, you know,
[20:14.520 --> 20:19.400]  it's some kind of protection against the government,
[20:19.400 --> 20:20.880]  that, you know, you can protect yourself,
[20:20.880 --> 20:22.520]  and that that's what encryption is,
[20:22.520 --> 20:23.520]  that you can have this device
[20:23.520 --> 20:25.080]  where you protect the data yourself,
[20:25.080 --> 20:26.860]  and you have a right to do this as an individual.
[20:26.860 --> 20:27.700]  So I kind of see it.
[20:27.700 --> 20:29.840]  It breaks, to me, it breaks down at a very quickly,
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.400]  because gun legislate, encryption is binary.
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.160]  Your stuff is either encrypted securely,
[20:36.160 --> 20:38.680]  or it's not encrypted securely, yes or no.
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.640]  And yes, there's different strengths to, you know,
[20:40.640 --> 20:42.640]  you get greater and greater key lengths
[20:42.640 --> 20:44.400]  and different algorithms and stuff like that.
[20:44.400 --> 20:46.160]  So I'm not saying all encryption is equivalent,
[20:46.160 --> 20:48.640]  but it's either securely encrypted or not,
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.040]  whereas gun ownership is, or gun legislation,
[20:52.040 --> 20:54.140]  in terms of which guns you can buy,
[20:54.140 --> 20:56.120]  is clearly, there's a spectrum.
[20:56.120 --> 20:57.620]  And everybody agrees.
[20:57.620 --> 20:58.960]  This is one of those things that, to me,
[20:58.960 --> 20:59.960]  drives me nuts about,
[20:59.960 --> 21:01.760]  when you talk about gun control legislation,
[21:01.760 --> 21:02.960]  is that everybody seems to agree,
[21:02.960 --> 21:05.000]  even if the hardest of the hardliners
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.280]  on the Second Amendment,
[21:06.280 --> 21:09.600]  that, you know, normal civilians
[21:09.600 --> 21:12.080]  shouldn't be able to buy surface-to-air missiles
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.440]  to shoot down jetliners, you know,
[21:13.440 --> 21:15.760]  that somewhere, everybody's willing to draw a line
[21:15.760 --> 21:18.280]  that these arms are too powerful,
[21:18.280 --> 21:21.040]  and that the debate is where that line should be drawn.
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.240]  But again, you know, for anybody,
[21:23.240 --> 21:24.520]  and I'm sure, this is one of those topics
[21:24.520 --> 21:26.520]  where I'm sure there are people who listen to the show.
[21:26.520 --> 21:28.240]  In fact, I know a couple of them,
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.360]  friends who listen to the show,
[21:29.360 --> 21:32.600]  who are, you know, staunch advocates
[21:32.600 --> 21:34.380]  of gun ownership rights.
[21:35.540 --> 21:36.480]  But I do see the connection,
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.920]  and I suspect, though, that those type of listeners,
[21:38.920 --> 21:41.200]  people who can bear to listen to my show
[21:41.200 --> 21:44.100]  and the small doses of politics I drop into it,
[21:44.100 --> 21:46.760]  but are staunch Second Amendment advocates,
[21:46.760 --> 21:50.520]  I guarantee you, those listeners are on Apple's side in this.
[21:50.520 --> 21:53.800]  So I do think it makes for an interesting public debate.
[21:53.800 --> 21:56.120]  Yeah, I mean, the problem is that there's,
[21:57.480 --> 22:01.440]  sadly, not enough representation of those views
[22:01.440 --> 22:03.520]  in politics, really,
[22:03.520 --> 22:05.640]  because most of the candidates
[22:05.640 --> 22:08.960]  have come out strongly in favor of the FBI.
[22:08.960 --> 22:12.400]  Or if they're not strongly in favor of the FBI,
[22:12.400 --> 22:15.560]  like our man Trump, what's Trump say?
[22:15.560 --> 22:17.100]  Just open the damn phone?
[22:17.100 --> 22:18.480]  Just open the damn phone. Just open the damn phone.
[22:18.480 --> 22:19.920]  Just open it up.
[22:19.920 --> 22:20.760]  That's easy.
[22:22.200 --> 22:23.740]  The thing that's a little frustrating
[22:23.740 --> 22:28.740]  is that the other side is kind of getting involved.
[22:29.640 --> 22:32.360]  Their take is more or less wishful thinking.
[22:32.360 --> 22:35.040]  Like, let's put smart people in a room,
[22:35.040 --> 22:36.720]  and, you know, from law enforcement
[22:36.720 --> 22:38.580]  and from these great American tech companies,
[22:38.580 --> 22:40.380]  and I'm sure they'll come up with something
[22:40.380 --> 22:45.380]  that will keep everybody's data completely safe and secure
[22:46.360 --> 22:49.360]  and will let the FBI look at it whenever they want to.
[22:49.360 --> 22:52.320]  Nothing bad has ever come out of a smoke-filled room.
[22:54.760 --> 22:56.080]  Except maybe the smoke.
[22:57.400 --> 23:00.800]  This one that you sent me, I didn't see this.
[23:00.800 --> 23:03.320]  I guess because it came out yesterday.
[23:03.320 --> 23:04.480]  I didn't even know that there was
[23:04.480 --> 23:05.920]  a Sunday Wall Street Journal.
[23:05.920 --> 23:07.660]  Maybe it came out in the newspaper today
[23:07.660 --> 23:09.400]  and it just has the yesterday's dateline.
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.240]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.360]  By L. Gordon, L. Gordon Kravitz.
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.240]  Now, this sounds like a made-up name.
[23:17.880 --> 23:22.880]  He used to be the publisher of the journal, apparently.
[23:23.280 --> 23:27.480]  I had not really heard of him before this piece, but...
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.440]  Number one, if you're a conservative
[23:29.440 --> 23:32.360]  and you go by first initial Gordon something,
[23:33.360 --> 23:34.480]  don't.
[23:34.480 --> 23:35.880]  Stop it.
[23:35.880 --> 23:37.920]  And his first name is Lewis.
[23:37.920 --> 23:41.640]  It's not like it's Levonsky or something.
[23:41.640 --> 23:44.360]  I mean, it's not like some long or complicated
[23:44.360 --> 23:46.520]  or name that he would have gotten teased about.
[23:46.520 --> 23:47.600]  L. Gordon Liddy.
[23:48.840 --> 23:49.680]  Yeah, right.
[23:49.680 --> 23:51.880]  Like, this is a guy, he's probably about our age, so he...
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.080]  He's doing it on purpose.
[23:53.080 --> 23:55.600]  Right, like, he's a guy who looked at G. Gordon Liddy
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.640]  and was like, hey, my middle name's Gordon.
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.240]  I'm gonna be cool.
[24:01.240 --> 24:02.920]  It's important to have role models.
[24:02.920 --> 24:05.000]  I'm gonna be cool like a political hack
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.360]  who did Time for Nixon and became a...
[24:09.360 --> 24:13.120]  After he got out, became a right-wing radio kook.
[24:13.120 --> 24:14.120]  Right.
[24:14.120 --> 24:17.800]  How would you summarize his headline
[24:17.800 --> 24:19.280]  is Apple's Rotten Core?
[24:19.280 --> 24:21.240]  So he went there, he went to the...
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.120]  Well, he spends a lot of time talking about...
[24:24.120 --> 24:26.520]  He starts out by sort of trying to make it seem
[24:26.520 --> 24:28.200]  like Apple's argument is all about
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.120]  whether it's difficult to do or not
[24:30.120 --> 24:32.160]  and tries to make it seem like Apple
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.000]  just doesn't wanna do it
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.320]  because they're saying it's hard
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.240]  when that's really not the situation at all.
[24:41.560 --> 24:43.760]  And at some point he says that...
[24:43.760 --> 24:44.600]  He says...
[24:44.600 --> 24:46.240]  Let me see if I can find the quote.
[24:50.040 --> 24:52.600]  Apple engineers have...
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.080]  I can't find it, but he says that Apple engineers
[24:55.080 --> 24:58.360]  have basically admitted that it would...
[24:58.360 --> 25:00.160]  It could only apply to this one phone.
[25:00.160 --> 25:05.160]  Without linking to anything.
[25:05.160 --> 25:07.520]  Apple at first claimed, this is a quote,
[25:07.520 --> 25:11.120]  that this work would affect millions of customers.
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.880]  Now its engineers admit code can apply to a specific iPhone.
[25:16.680 --> 25:18.080]  Which Apple has never said.
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.360]  Well, they could make an instance of the OS
[25:22.360 --> 25:24.320]  that only applies to one phone,
[25:24.320 --> 25:27.520]  but at this point you're starting to talk...
[25:27.520 --> 25:30.000]  It's like talking copy protection
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.720]  with video games and apps,
[25:32.720 --> 25:35.800]  where once you have a version of the OS
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.160]  that has a statement that says,
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.800]  if the device ID equals this exact device ID,
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.200]  then go ahead and let them enter
[25:45.200 --> 25:47.120]  as many passcodes as they want.
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.440]  Then somebody who illicitly obtained a copy of the OS
[25:50.440 --> 25:52.640]  can break into a debugger and just say,
[25:52.640 --> 25:54.480]  why don't we just skip that if check?
[25:55.320 --> 25:56.640]  And again, I realized,
[25:56.640 --> 26:00.080]  and I'm not gonna start a computer science podcast.
[26:00.080 --> 26:02.640]  I realized that there are ways to obfuscate that code
[26:02.640 --> 26:06.640]  so that it's not that easy to identify
[26:06.640 --> 26:08.360]  when you break into the debugger.
[26:08.360 --> 26:09.480]  But on the other hand,
[26:09.480 --> 26:11.920]  I'll go back to my analogy of software copy protection
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.960]  where you can't beat it eventually.
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.720]  I mean, whatever checks,
[26:18.720 --> 26:21.080]  and most apps and games that are serious about it
[26:21.080 --> 26:24.520]  don't just have a if serial number equals legit,
[26:24.520 --> 26:26.680]  go ahead and play the game.
[26:26.680 --> 26:28.520]  I mean, I try to make it more complicated than that,
[26:28.520 --> 26:32.840]  but anybody who's ever tried to investigate
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.440]  at how much pirated software is out floating around
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.560]  the world and always has been,
[26:36.560 --> 26:39.800]  will realize that there's always ways around it.
[26:39.800 --> 26:42.200]  And it's the idea that there'd be this version.
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.600]  I'm gonna go with this analogy.
[26:44.600 --> 26:45.440]  It's not that bad.
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.920]  It's sort of like they're asking them to make a game
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.320]  that, but we'll make sure we're the only ones
[26:49.320 --> 26:51.240]  with the serial number.
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.560]  But then anybody could crack it
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.360]  and now everybody's got a phone cracking thing.
[26:57.920 --> 26:59.840]  He also said, when Apple refused the court order,
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.760]  Apple defenders claimed it was impossible
[27:01.760 --> 27:03.360]  to unlock the phone.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.720]  Now see, nobody said that.
[27:04.720 --> 27:05.680]  I don't, nobody said that.
[27:05.680 --> 27:07.200]  Nobody said that.
[27:07.200 --> 27:09.320]  I quoted a thing today where,
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.360]  and maybe I even went the wrong way,
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.360]  but that somebody,
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.360]  there was this Washington Post story on the thing
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.520]  and they were like,
[27:16.520 --> 27:17.920]  somebody was trying to give a quote like,
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.000]  well, both sides are kind of liars.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.960]  Former Justice Department official Jennifer Daskow
[27:22.960 --> 27:25.040]  said both sides are overstating our argument.
[27:25.040 --> 27:27.000]  She said, the government is wrong to say
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.160]  this is just about one case.
[27:29.160 --> 27:30.560]  On the other hand, it is wrong to say
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.960]  that if Apple loses this case,
[27:31.960 --> 27:33.760]  there's absolutely no limits
[27:33.760 --> 27:36.240]  to what the government can order a company to do.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.880]  And on Daring Fireball,
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.800]  I said, well, the first part is totally true.
[27:40.800 --> 27:42.960]  The government really is being disingenuous
[27:42.960 --> 27:45.280]  about this applying to just one phone.
[27:46.200 --> 27:47.160]  And I said that nobody,
[27:47.160 --> 27:48.000]  especially not Apple,
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.120]  is using words like absolutely no limits
[27:50.120 --> 27:52.200]  on what the government can order a company to do.
[27:52.200 --> 27:53.080]  A couple of people emailed and said,
[27:53.080 --> 27:54.200]  well, actually, Apple's order
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.600]  doesn't quite say that exactly,
[27:55.600 --> 27:57.440]  but they do say that there's no end to the limit.
[27:57.440 --> 27:59.160]  And like you said,
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.840]  with the other one,
[28:00.840 --> 28:02.600]  the Ornstein one that,
[28:02.600 --> 28:04.360]  or whatever else,
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.480]  who'd you say said that
[28:05.480 --> 28:06.800]  this could lead to the conclusion
[28:06.800 --> 28:09.520]  that the government could order you to kill people?
[28:09.520 --> 28:10.360]  That was Ornstein.
[28:10.360 --> 28:12.240]  Right, that actually.
[28:12.240 --> 28:14.160]  I mean, that was not necessarily,
[28:14.160 --> 28:16.200]  that was not saying that Apple,
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.040]  I mean, it was basically,
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.520]  that was a legal interpretation of the-
[28:19.520 --> 28:20.800]  Disinterpretation of the-
[28:20.800 --> 28:21.640]  That All Writs Act.
[28:21.640 --> 28:23.920]  Basically, they were saying that,
[28:23.920 --> 28:27.920]  they were saying that the written law did not apply,
[28:27.920 --> 28:30.880]  and so they needed to invoke the All Writs Act.
[28:30.880 --> 28:33.480]  And I think Ornstein was saying,
[28:33.480 --> 28:35.840]  no, there's actually a law on the books about this,
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.080]  and you can't just ignore that
[28:37.080 --> 28:38.520]  and invoke the All Writs Act,
[28:38.520 --> 28:39.760]  because if you start doing that,
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.160]  then you can do anything you want.
[28:41.160 --> 28:42.760]  You know, this is exactly
[28:42.760 --> 28:45.400]  what the rule of law is about.
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.280]  Right, we make these rules,
[28:47.280 --> 28:50.520]  we have a general agreement as to what words mean,
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.360]  and therefore, you follow the law.
[29:01.360 --> 29:02.560]  I've seen some people,
[29:05.560 --> 29:06.640]  I don't even know if it's worth it,
[29:06.640 --> 29:08.880]  I don't know, I feel like listeners at the show are smart,
[29:08.880 --> 29:09.720]  they're not going this way,
[29:09.720 --> 29:11.000]  but on Twitter, there've been some people
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.080]  who've approached me with the,
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.560]  well, how would I feel
[29:13.560 --> 29:16.680]  if one of my family members had been killed by these people?
[29:16.680 --> 29:20.720]  Did you see the one that somebody had quoted?
[29:20.720 --> 29:23.080]  No, I don't think so.
[29:23.080 --> 29:26.960]  That said, how would Tim Cook feel
[29:26.960 --> 29:28.080]  if his wife had been murdered?
[29:28.080 --> 29:28.920]  Oh, no.
[29:38.400 --> 29:40.280]  There's a couple problems with that statement.
[29:40.280 --> 29:42.200]  He'd be very surprised.
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.600]  Yeah, I think surprise would probably be
[29:43.600 --> 29:44.440]  his first reaction.
[29:44.440 --> 29:45.720]  His first reaction would be?
[29:45.720 --> 29:48.320]  The police called him and said,
[29:48.320 --> 29:51.440]  Mr. Cook, we have terrible news.
[29:51.440 --> 29:52.840]  Your wife has been murdered.
[29:55.480 --> 29:56.960]  Say what now?
[29:56.960 --> 29:58.480]  That would be something.
[30:00.760 --> 30:03.600]  But this is why we don't have juries
[30:03.600 --> 30:05.520]  made up of the family members of the victim.
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.120]  I sympathize, I really do,
[30:07.120 --> 30:11.000]  and I totally agree with Apple's emphasis,
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.120]  not just on PR, but I think they really mean it,
[30:13.120 --> 30:14.400]  that every time they talk about this
[30:14.400 --> 30:15.240]  or publish something,
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.560]  they say something right up front
[30:16.560 --> 30:19.080]  about the tremendous sympathy they have
[30:19.080 --> 30:22.480]  for the families of the victims of this incident,
[30:22.480 --> 30:23.400]  and every incident,
[30:23.400 --> 30:25.560]  and that they cannot abide terrorism.
[30:25.560 --> 30:26.960]  It's the trade-off.
[30:26.960 --> 30:30.680]  There is no perfect way to cut this off.
[30:30.680 --> 30:33.880]  You can either sacrifice
[30:33.880 --> 30:38.240]  some law enforcement opportunities
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.600]  to find clues and protect privacy
[30:42.600 --> 30:46.160]  and civil liberties for everybody or not,
[30:48.600 --> 30:50.640]  but that's the trade-off that our system
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.640]  and our founders made 200 and whatever years ago.
[30:54.640 --> 30:57.040]  Yeah, and as a matter of fact,
[30:57.040 --> 31:00.040]  one of the relatives of one of the victims
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.200]  has actually sided with Apple.
[31:02.200 --> 31:04.000]  I'm not surprised, because, you know.
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.320]  Yeah, I mean, of course,
[31:05.320 --> 31:07.360]  there's gonna be people on both sides, right?
[31:07.360 --> 31:08.200]  I mean, there's gonna be people
[31:08.200 --> 31:11.680]  who desperately want Apple to unlock the phone,
[31:11.680 --> 31:13.600]  and then there's gonna be people who want it the other way.
[31:13.600 --> 31:16.560]  Right, with 14 victims, 14 dead,
[31:16.560 --> 31:19.240]  and 22 others who were seriously injured,
[31:19.240 --> 31:21.000]  I mean, you're gonna find people
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.360]  who were directly involved on all sides of it.
[31:24.360 --> 31:25.200]  Yeah.
[31:25.200 --> 31:26.920]  It is hard, but it's, again, this is, you know,
[31:26.920 --> 31:30.120]  and it's, I'm trying not to get angry
[31:30.120 --> 31:32.040]  at the FBI for doing it,
[31:32.040 --> 31:33.480]  and privately, I guess I would,
[31:33.480 --> 31:34.800]  but at least professionally here
[31:34.800 --> 31:36.720]  on this very professional show, I won't,
[31:36.720 --> 31:40.800]  but it's infuriating that people who,
[31:40.800 --> 31:43.560]  and clearly, people who work in the Justice Department
[31:43.560 --> 31:46.400]  and the FBI are dispassionate about this,
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.040]  and they understand civil liberties.
[31:48.040 --> 31:52.000]  I mean, as far, I think, I don't know if it's still the case
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.600]  but I think that for most, just about every FBI agent,
[31:55.600 --> 31:57.480]  unless you're some kind of specialist,
[31:57.480 --> 31:59.840]  is, you have to have a law degree.
[32:01.960 --> 32:05.040]  You know, FBI agents are not like, you know,
[32:05.040 --> 32:08.000]  your local police department.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.960]  I mean, these guys and women, these men and women,
[32:10.960 --> 32:13.400]  are legal experts, they're lawyers.
[32:13.400 --> 32:15.640]  Well, they're not, they're not all lawyers.
[32:15.640 --> 32:16.480]  Well, a lot of them are.
[32:16.480 --> 32:17.320]  I think most of them are.
[32:17.320 --> 32:18.160]  A lot of them are, yeah.
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.480]  I think it's the standard way to become an FBI agent
[32:20.480 --> 32:21.320]  is to be a lawyer.
[32:21.320 --> 32:23.280]  I think, you know, like, you could be Dana Scully
[32:23.280 --> 32:24.120]  and be a medical doctor.
[32:24.120 --> 32:25.560]  I think a lot, well, but a lot of them
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.120]  do come from law enforcement,
[32:27.120 --> 32:30.160]  and I don't think it's a situation
[32:30.160 --> 32:32.440]  where they go from law enforcement to law school
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.280]  and then to the FBI.
[32:33.280 --> 32:35.080]  I think, I mean, you have to be, I think you just,
[32:35.080 --> 32:35.920]  you have to.
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.760]  Well, they're informed.
[32:36.760 --> 32:37.600]  It's not easy.
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.440]  I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm,
[32:38.440 --> 32:41.080]  but I don't believe you have to have, like, a specific,
[32:41.080 --> 32:44.000]  you don't have to be a, whatever, JD.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.120]  What I'm saying though is that they know what they're doing.
[32:46.120 --> 32:48.280]  You know, they know the legal argument.
[32:48.280 --> 32:50.680]  You don't have to be Amy Girmar, is what I'm saying.
[32:50.680 --> 32:55.680]  There's the cynicism involved to make these,
[32:56.800 --> 32:59.720]  the San Bernardino family members
[32:59.720 --> 33:01.800]  who are siding with them publicly,
[33:01.800 --> 33:05.360]  to use that to their advantage is,
[33:05.360 --> 33:08.120]  it's easy to, it could get me worked up
[33:08.120 --> 33:09.480]  if I really think about it.
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.240]  Yeah, I just expect better.
[33:13.480 --> 33:14.560]  I don't, I was about to.
[33:14.560 --> 33:17.720]  Well, I guess that's my problem.
[33:17.720 --> 33:19.880]  That's the problem that I expect better
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.640]  from today's US federal government.
[33:24.240 --> 33:25.840]  I should, maybe I should be,
[33:25.840 --> 33:29.240]  I should have a disclosure that I,
[33:29.240 --> 33:32.440]  my wife is a defense investigator.
[33:32.440 --> 33:35.720]  So, I guess in my family,
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.720]  we come at it from a certain perspective.
[33:37.720 --> 33:42.600]  And, you know, some of that is born of the experience
[33:42.600 --> 33:45.800]  of the cases that she's been involved with
[33:45.800 --> 33:47.360]  over the years that she's been born.
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.400]  Right, and seeing some of the shenanigans.
[33:49.400 --> 33:51.760]  And I mean, the shenanigans is almost a whitewash
[33:51.760 --> 33:53.280]  of some of the stuff that, you know.
[33:53.280 --> 33:54.120]  Exactly.
[33:55.160 --> 33:57.160]  Yeah, similar thing here where my wife
[33:57.160 --> 33:59.800]  was a defense attorney and.
[34:00.800 --> 34:01.640]  So we're perfect.
[34:01.640 --> 34:02.480]  Yeah.
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.400]  We're perfect to have a discussion.
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.240]  Totally unbiased.
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.240]  Yeah, we have all sides of the debate.
[34:11.120 --> 34:14.200]  We have a guy named John whose wife works
[34:14.200 --> 34:15.840]  in criminal investigations,
[34:15.840 --> 34:18.760]  and we have a guy named John whose wife worked
[34:18.760 --> 34:21.240]  in criminal legal defense.
[34:21.240 --> 34:22.440]  Yeah, right, used to work.
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.200]  See, your wife used to work, right?
[34:24.200 --> 34:25.040]  And now.
[34:25.040 --> 34:26.520]  Right, exactly.
[34:26.520 --> 34:27.360]  So that's the difference.
[34:27.360 --> 34:28.400]  That's the difference.
[34:28.400 --> 34:29.960]  Both sides of the aisle.
[34:29.960 --> 34:31.200]  From two guys named John.
[34:32.920 --> 34:34.720]  With no formal training in any of them.
[34:34.720 --> 34:35.560]  Who like Apple.
[34:35.560 --> 34:36.400]  Who like Apple.
[34:37.760 --> 34:39.600]  Pretend that because they read the All Ritz Act
[34:39.600 --> 34:41.880]  that they know what the hell is going on.
[34:41.880 --> 34:43.800]  I'm curious how this is gonna play out.
[34:43.800 --> 34:46.440]  I'm also curious, I guess we should take a break
[34:46.440 --> 34:49.560]  and I should talk about one of our friendly sponsors.
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.600]  But when we come back, I'm curious how this is played out,
[34:54.640 --> 34:56.000]  is gonna play out in Congress.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.480]  And I'm not even sure, I got the dates all mixed up.
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.000]  So I don't know, maybe you can figure this out afterwards.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.760]  But let me take a break though,
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.280]  and thank long time sponsor of the show,
[35:07.280 --> 35:09.960]  our good friends at Backblaze.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  Backblaze is online backup for your Mac.
[35:19.240 --> 35:21.560]  And you install it on your Mac.
[35:21.560 --> 35:24.520]  And it just uploads everything you've got.
[35:24.520 --> 35:26.840]  It holds all your content.
[35:26.840 --> 35:28.560]  Everything you've got in your user directory.
[35:28.560 --> 35:31.120]  You've got an external hard drive, it goes up to.
[35:31.120 --> 35:35.760]  All of it goes to Backblaze's secure cloud storage.
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.240]  All of your data is up there in the cloud after it uploads.
[35:40.240 --> 35:41.800]  And then you can get it from anywhere.
[35:41.800 --> 35:42.920]  You can use their iPhone.
[35:42.920 --> 35:45.520]  It's not even just like for like disaster recovery.
[35:45.520 --> 35:48.000]  Although it does work for that too.
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.720]  Like if disaster strikes, you can just go there
[35:49.720 --> 35:52.400]  and have them load everything onto a USB hard drive
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.120]  and they will send it right to you.
[35:55.120 --> 35:56.160]  But it's not just for that.
[35:56.160 --> 35:58.160]  Let's say you're out and about and you need a file
[35:58.160 --> 36:00.120]  and all you have with you is your phone
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.280]  and it's not even in your Dropbox, it's somewhere else.
[36:02.280 --> 36:04.800]  It's on your desktop or something like that.
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.560]  Just go to the Backblaze app, go up there,
[36:06.560 --> 36:08.560]  go to your desktop and there it is.
[36:08.560 --> 36:10.360]  You can get the file and email it
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.080]  or whatever you need to do with it from your phone.
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.760]  25% of all of their restores that customers actually do
[36:16.760 --> 36:19.120]  are just one file at a time.
[36:19.120 --> 36:22.840]  So it's a really great service for stuff like that.
[36:22.840 --> 36:25.240]  The service, the software is written,
[36:25.240 --> 36:26.440]  at least the Mac version is written
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.320]  by former Apple engineers.
[36:29.320 --> 36:31.360]  These are guys who really, really know.
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.400]  It's not like some kind of goofy Java app
[36:34.400 --> 36:37.720]  that number one, Java, you have to download Java.
[36:37.720 --> 36:38.560]  No, it's nothing like that.
[36:38.560 --> 36:39.960]  It's real Mac software.
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.800]  You just interface it.
[36:41.800 --> 36:43.320]  It's the only interface you go through
[36:43.320 --> 36:45.120]  is a little system preferences panel.
[36:45.960 --> 36:46.800]  Easy to set up.
[36:46.800 --> 36:49.000]  The defaults are all saying there's not a lot of options.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.880]  You just sign up and you get a free account, number one.
[36:53.280 --> 36:56.480]  You get a free trial with no credit card required.
[36:56.480 --> 36:59.200]  Just go to backblaze.com slash steering fireball
[37:00.360 --> 37:01.760]  and just let it run, it uploads.
[37:01.760 --> 37:05.040]  And then after that, when you say, wow, this works,
[37:05.040 --> 37:07.600]  crazy that I didn't do what Gruber told me to do a year ago
[37:07.600 --> 37:09.320]  and sign up then.
[37:09.320 --> 37:10.320]  Glad I did it now though.
[37:10.320 --> 37:11.480]  You didn't, what do you do after that?
[37:11.480 --> 37:13.640]  You just pay five bucks per month per computer
[37:13.640 --> 37:14.480]  and that's it.
[37:14.480 --> 37:16.200]  And it's like, you're saying,
[37:16.200 --> 37:17.640]  I have a three terabyte drive.
[37:17.640 --> 37:19.280]  Well, guess what, it doesn't matter.
[37:19.280 --> 37:21.600]  It's just five bucks per computer.
[37:21.600 --> 37:23.280]  That's it, it doesn't matter how much data you have
[37:23.280 --> 37:25.120]  and you'll feel so much better knowing your stuff
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.480]  is backed up outside your home or your office
[37:28.480 --> 37:29.320]  or wherever you are.
[37:29.320 --> 37:31.520]  So my thanks to backblaze, backblaze.com
[37:31.520 --> 37:32.920]  slash daring fireball.
[37:32.920 --> 37:36.120]  If you haven't signed up already, you're nuts.
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.080]  Or pal, Peter Cohen just went to work for backblaze.
[37:41.080 --> 37:43.040]  You almost said it, black base.
[37:43.040 --> 37:43.920]  I know, I know, I know.
[37:43.920 --> 37:46.120]  You have practiced.
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.120]  You, I don't even know how you do that, but good for you.
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.520]  So years ago I did a podcast where I could not say backblaze
[37:58.520 --> 38:01.360]  and I said blackblaze over and over and over again.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.920]  And so our friend-
[38:02.920 --> 38:04.240]  It's very hard, it's not easy.
[38:04.240 --> 38:06.600]  My friend Yev who's like their marketing guy
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.080]  went and listened to the show
[38:08.080 --> 38:10.840]  and he went over to, you know, domain name register
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.720]  and he registered blackblaze.com and forwarded it.
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.600]  That's definitely the, that's definitely the solution.
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.160]  Yeah, it's like, I really liked that.
[38:19.160 --> 38:21.920]  I wish every time I screwed up a sponsorship read
[38:21.920 --> 38:24.440]  that they would just do what Yev did and just-
[38:24.440 --> 38:25.880]  That one I understand.
[38:25.880 --> 38:28.760]  Pixelmator, I still don't understand.
[38:28.760 --> 38:30.160]  I didn't know how to say it.
[38:32.800 --> 38:35.600]  I don't know how you would read that.
[38:35.600 --> 38:37.800]  I guess my initial guess was pixelmator,
[38:37.800 --> 38:39.280]  but then I thought, well, maybe that's wrong.
[38:39.280 --> 38:42.480]  And they were, you know, they're European.
[38:42.480 --> 38:43.960]  They don't even speak English.
[38:43.960 --> 38:44.880]  So I made a guess.
[38:44.880 --> 38:46.280]  Yeah.
[38:46.280 --> 38:47.680]  Yeah, I think they're, aren't they either German?
[38:47.680 --> 38:48.680]  I think they're Germans.
[38:48.680 --> 38:50.200]  Yeah, so pixelmator.
[38:50.200 --> 38:52.840]  Yeah, pixelmator.
[38:52.840 --> 38:53.680]  It's good.
[38:56.200 --> 38:57.040]  So,
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.280]  it's one of those things where it's like,
[39:01.280 --> 39:03.320]  if you don't announce, if a tree,
[39:04.320 --> 39:06.120]  if a tree was never announced
[39:07.160 --> 39:09.000]  and then it doesn't grow out of the ground,
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.120]  does it make a sound?
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.960]  So if Apple never announced a date for a March event,
[39:12.960 --> 39:14.640]  can the date be moved?
[39:16.600 --> 39:17.440]  No.
[39:17.440 --> 39:18.280]  Not really.
[39:18.280 --> 39:19.320]  I say no, no.
[39:19.320 --> 39:21.400]  No, I mean, if you're deciding
[39:22.240 --> 39:24.440]  when you're gonna have your birthday party
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.360]  and you're kind of thinking about having it on the 15th
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.200]  and you move it to the 21st, that's.
[39:31.200 --> 39:33.040]  Right, until the invitations go out.
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.080]  I mean, you know, in your mind you moved it.
[39:36.080 --> 39:36.920]  Right.
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.960]  But it's, you know, we shouldn't all be talking
[39:38.960 --> 39:39.800]  about it being moved.
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.480]  And the same goes for changing the name of the phone
[39:43.480 --> 39:46.040]  that hasn't been announced yet from the iPhone 5SE
[39:46.040 --> 39:47.560]  to the iPhone SE.
[39:47.560 --> 39:49.280]  They changed the name of the phone.
[39:50.800 --> 39:51.640]  But anyway.
[39:51.640 --> 39:52.480]  That's a lot of scratching.
[39:52.480 --> 39:54.480]  That's a lot of scratching off the back of the device.
[39:54.480 --> 39:55.320]  A couple of weeks ago.
[39:55.320 --> 39:56.160]  Actually, they don't.
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.760]  A couple of weeks ago, it leaked through, you know,
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.280]  the usual sources that Apple was planning a March event
[40:03.280 --> 40:07.720]  for this new four-inch iPhone and the new iPad.
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.720]  And I guess the rumors say no major updates to the watch.
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.280]  Not like what the second-generation Apple watch,
[40:16.280 --> 40:18.360]  but new bands and.
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.880]  New bands.
[40:19.880 --> 40:21.000]  I don't know what else.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.640]  That it was gonna be Tuesday, March 15th.
[40:22.640 --> 40:25.600]  And then I guess it was over the weekend.
[40:25.600 --> 40:27.600]  Was it Sunday that it came out?
[40:27.600 --> 40:28.440]  I know it was over the weekend.
[40:28.440 --> 40:29.280]  Yeah, I think so.
[40:29.280 --> 40:32.520]  But Kara Swisher at Recode broke the story, actually.
[40:32.520 --> 40:33.680]  And then John Petchkowski,
[40:33.680 --> 40:35.600]  who usually gets those date things first.
[40:35.600 --> 40:39.960]  He's at Buzzfeed now, was about an hour later
[40:39.960 --> 40:40.800]  and said so too.
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.160]  And that, nope, it's gonna be Monday, March 21st.
[40:45.160 --> 40:48.240]  So it's not on a Tuesday, it's on a Monday.
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.760]  Which sucked for me.
[40:50.760 --> 40:53.120]  Because I tried to do the right thing.
[40:53.120 --> 40:53.960]  So I don't know.
[40:53.960 --> 40:55.920]  Let me just emphasize this right now.
[40:55.920 --> 40:57.480]  I have no idea.
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.320]  Nobody at Apple, officially or unofficially,
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.400]  has given me any indication of when this event is.
[41:04.400 --> 41:06.240]  And on the other hand, I've never asked.
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.680]  And I would guess that at some point
[41:08.680 --> 41:09.520]  in the next week or two,
[41:09.520 --> 41:10.960]  I'll get an email with an invitation.
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.480]  It'll say, please join us at town hall on whatever date.
[41:15.480 --> 41:16.600]  But I tried to be smart.
[41:16.600 --> 41:19.840]  And based on the leak, I booked Airfare.
[41:19.840 --> 41:22.200]  So I had Airfare for the original date.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.280]  Oh, yeah.
[41:25.280 --> 41:26.840]  Oh, oh, you booked Airfare then.
[41:26.840 --> 41:28.640]  Right, I booked Airfare then.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.240]  Now, I always stay.
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.080]  I expect, and again, I don't know.
[41:33.080 --> 41:34.720]  I just take guesses on these things.
[41:34.720 --> 41:35.560]  I don't know.
[41:35.560 --> 41:36.640]  But I fly out.
[41:36.640 --> 41:38.640]  I always stay in San Francisco.
[41:38.640 --> 41:39.960]  Even if I know.
[41:39.960 --> 41:41.800]  Even if I know for a fact that the event is
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.800]  going to be in Cupertino.
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.560]  Because really, there's not much to do down there.
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.320]  You don't like the days in?
[41:49.320 --> 41:51.040]  I forget where I stayed the long time.
[41:51.040 --> 41:52.280]  When I went out for that Mercedes thing
[41:52.280 --> 41:54.320]  I talked about a while ago.
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.400]  It was a very nice hotel.
[41:55.400 --> 41:56.440]  It was fine.
[41:56.440 --> 41:58.360]  But it's really, you could be, I mean,
[41:58.360 --> 42:01.080]  there's just nothing going on.
[42:01.080 --> 42:02.400]  And I have friends in San Francisco.
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.480]  So it's less, it's more fun and it's a better trip
[42:06.480 --> 42:08.040]  if I just bite the bullet and wake up
[42:08.040 --> 42:10.080]  and somehow find a ride from San Francisco
[42:10.080 --> 42:12.200]  to Cupertino in the morning for the event
[42:12.200 --> 42:14.080]  than the other way around.
[42:14.080 --> 42:14.920]  Than to try to fulfill.
[42:14.920 --> 42:15.760]  What is that ride?
[42:15.760 --> 42:17.080]  Is it a half hour or 45 miles?
[42:17.080 --> 42:18.880]  Oh, it really varies by traffic.
[42:18.880 --> 42:21.120]  It's probably more like an hour.
[42:21.120 --> 42:22.080]  And I think you got it.
[42:22.080 --> 42:24.440]  You really want to kind of play it.
[42:24.440 --> 42:27.760]  I never do the driving, though, so I'm actually not sure.
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.360]  I think if you get good traffic and you
[42:29.360 --> 42:32.360]  can get in the passing lane, you can make it in 45.
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.880]  40 minutes, maybe.
[42:33.880 --> 42:34.920]  40 minutes to an hour.
[42:34.920 --> 42:38.320]  If you hit traffic, it's good luck.
[42:38.320 --> 42:39.880]  But I have friends.
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.320]  Again, friend of the show, Panzarino,
[42:41.320 --> 42:43.320]  is coming in for the same event.
[42:43.320 --> 42:44.640]  And he's going to have a car.
[42:44.640 --> 42:48.640]  So I'll just hitch a ride with him.
[42:48.640 --> 42:50.600]  It's like part of the, I mean, you know this, right?
[42:50.600 --> 42:52.800]  Any part of the rules, if you want to be on the talk show,
[42:52.800 --> 42:54.560]  is if I ever need a ride, you have to.
[42:54.560 --> 43:02.360]  I don't take advantage of it very often.
[43:02.360 --> 43:03.200]  You can verify.
[43:03.200 --> 43:04.320]  You've been on the show a lot of times.
[43:04.320 --> 43:06.200]  And I've never once called you and said,
[43:06.200 --> 43:08.240]  hey, Molt, I'm at the airport.
[43:08.240 --> 43:08.960]  I need a ride.
[43:08.960 --> 43:11.520]  No, I've given a ride to Cufasos.
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.320]  Yeah, probably on my credit.
[43:15.320 --> 43:16.960]  That's what I'm thinking, right?
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.960]  I think that defrays some of my debt.
[43:20.960 --> 43:23.400]  I had already booked my airfare.
[43:23.400 --> 43:24.880]  But I knew what I was getting into.
[43:24.880 --> 43:26.440]  I'm not mad.
[43:26.440 --> 43:28.480]  I feel like I lost a bet.
[43:28.480 --> 43:31.160]  But I knew it was a bet.
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.400]  I just thought, though, in times past,
[43:33.400 --> 43:36.200]  they give out the official invitation so late
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.680]  that if you book, only when you wake up in the morning
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.800]  and find the email that says, here's the official invitation,
[43:42.800 --> 43:45.760]  we're having a thing, you end up paying a lot more for airfare
[43:45.760 --> 43:47.680]  than if you book it in advance.
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.280]  And so I took the gamble to try to save some money.
[43:51.280 --> 43:53.040]  It turns out I'm actually going to.
[43:53.040 --> 43:55.400]  This is the episode where I talk about the accounting
[43:55.400 --> 43:56.520]  of running during Fireball.
[43:56.520 --> 43:58.800]  Turns out, though, I had to pay a $200.
[43:58.800 --> 44:00.160]  So that's why you had me on.
[44:00.160 --> 44:05.400]  I had to pay a $200 change fee for both legs of the flight.
[44:05.400 --> 44:07.600]  So there, you think, well, now you're out $400.
[44:07.600 --> 44:08.440]  And guess what?
[44:08.440 --> 44:09.760]  This is shocking.
[44:09.760 --> 44:11.520]  I know this is going to shock you.
[44:11.520 --> 44:14.360]  American Airlines, in addition to the $200 change
[44:14.360 --> 44:17.440]  fee for each leg of the fight, they charge you tax and service
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.280]  fees on top of that for the change fees.
[44:22.280 --> 44:23.080]  So it's cut.
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.400]  Well, first of all, it's horrible
[44:25.400 --> 44:27.200]  that you have to fly American Airlines.
[44:27.200 --> 44:27.880]  Oh my god.
[44:27.880 --> 44:30.280]  Don't even get me started on it.
[44:30.280 --> 44:31.360]  That's.
[44:31.360 --> 44:32.520]  Do you know the story?
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.880]  That's really the worst part of the whole story,
[44:34.880 --> 44:37.800]  regardless of the fees.
[44:37.800 --> 44:39.480]  But that's terrible.
[44:39.480 --> 44:45.200]  Well, long story short, Philly used to be dominated by US Air.
[44:45.200 --> 44:47.000]  We were like the biggest US Air hub.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.400]  And so US Air acquired American Airlines.
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.880]  So it's US Air that bought American.
[44:52.880 --> 44:54.160]  Oh, it was the other way around.
[44:54.160 --> 44:55.840]  No, but they kept the American name
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.640]  because it's a better name.
[44:57.640 --> 44:59.680]  OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
[44:59.680 --> 45:02.080]  And maybe American even has more flights.
[45:02.080 --> 45:03.880]  American might have been the bigger airline,
[45:03.880 --> 45:05.080]  but they were less profitable.
[45:05.080 --> 45:06.160]  American was losing money.
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.840]  And so US Air bought them and rebranded the whole company
[45:10.840 --> 45:13.120]  as American.
[45:13.120 --> 45:15.440]  It was sort of a mess for about eight months,
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.960]  where you'd be going through kiosks.
[45:19.960 --> 45:22.120]  And it'd be like an American desk and a US Air desk.
[45:22.120 --> 45:23.520]  And you'd show up at the US Air desk
[45:23.520 --> 45:24.600]  because you have a US Air ticket.
[45:24.600 --> 45:25.720]  And they're like, go to American.
[45:25.720 --> 45:27.440]  And it's like, all right, I'll go to American.
[45:27.440 --> 45:29.680]  And they're like, yeah, that's an American flight now.
[45:31.720 --> 45:34.160]  But anyway, they charge you a service fee
[45:34.160 --> 45:36.640]  on top of the change fee.
[45:39.520 --> 45:41.320]  It's like, is it run by Ticketmaster?
[45:41.320 --> 45:42.880]  Exactly.
[45:42.880 --> 45:44.680]  Wait, let me see that.
[45:44.680 --> 45:47.040]  Here's your convenience fee.
[45:47.040 --> 45:49.120]  How much did I pay for this?
[45:49.120 --> 45:50.920]  Think about how many airlines you've
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.960]  flown over the years that are just gone now.
[45:52.960 --> 45:55.080]  It's unbelievable.
[45:55.080 --> 45:57.560]  It's kind of like the tech industry for the most part.
[45:57.560 --> 45:58.120]  It really is.
[45:58.120 --> 45:59.360]  There's a few that have stuck around
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.720]  for a long period of time.
[46:00.720 --> 46:03.160]  And then there's a crap ton that came and went.
[46:03.160 --> 46:05.840]  Yeah, I can't even think of something.
[46:05.840 --> 46:07.720]  I don't think I ever was too before my time.
[46:07.720 --> 46:10.640]  I never flew TWA.
[46:10.640 --> 46:11.880]  I flew TWA.
[46:11.880 --> 46:15.360]  See, that's like a childhood memory, though.
[46:15.360 --> 46:21.440]  TWA reminds me of flying where you got cloth napkins
[46:21.440 --> 46:24.440]  and you got silverware in a plastic bag.
[46:24.440 --> 46:32.760]  And your dinner was like Salisbury steak.
[46:32.760 --> 46:35.440]  And there was a dessert and a salad.
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.800]  I mean, there were four little holder things on your tray.
[46:40.800 --> 46:44.920]  And the flight attendants were all in uniform.
[46:44.920 --> 46:50.440]  And they had hats on, and those were the days.
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.960]  And there was also a smoking section.
[46:53.960 --> 46:56.280]  One drawback, there was a smoking section.
[46:56.280 --> 47:00.120]  But you were used to it back then.
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.440]  Taxes and carrier imposed fees, $116.
[47:04.440 --> 47:05.080]  I don't know.
[47:05.080 --> 47:06.240]  It's hard to tell from the receipt.
[47:06.240 --> 47:06.560]  I don't know.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.760]  They might have charged me.
[47:07.760 --> 47:08.280]  Yeah.
[47:08.280 --> 47:08.840]  I don't know.
[47:08.840 --> 47:12.600]  But anyway, $400 plus the taxes and fees.
[47:12.600 --> 47:15.080]  I'm actually going to save money on the trip, though,
[47:15.080 --> 47:18.000]  because the hotels are so much cheaper in San Francisco
[47:18.000 --> 47:18.600]  the next week.
[47:18.600 --> 47:21.400]  Because the initial date, that March 15th week,
[47:21.400 --> 47:23.880]  coincides with the game developer conference
[47:23.880 --> 47:25.960]  in San Francisco, GDC.
[47:25.960 --> 47:32.320]  And my hotel was like $5,000 a night.
[47:32.320 --> 47:34.560]  It was so much that I was really worried about Amy
[47:34.560 --> 47:36.560]  looking at the MX, thinking that I
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.040]  got a room at the Four Seasons or the Ritz-Carlton
[47:40.040 --> 47:40.600]  or something.
[47:40.600 --> 47:43.400]  It's like all of the standard hotels that we've stayed at
[47:43.400 --> 47:45.920]  for years and years and years at all these things,
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.480]  they're all sold out because GDC is just insane.
[47:49.480 --> 47:51.000]  Because Apple's done this before.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.520]  They've had mid-March events.
[47:52.520 --> 47:56.520]  And it's coincided with GDC before.
[47:56.520 --> 47:59.480]  And it's just insane, John.
[47:59.480 --> 48:01.880]  When you get used to being there for WWDC or Macworld
[48:01.880 --> 48:04.120]  or something like that, it's like, oh, yeah, this is crap.
[48:04.120 --> 48:05.400]  There's thousands of people.
[48:05.400 --> 48:06.600]  And I see a lot of friends.
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.520]  GDC is like 75,000 people or something like that.
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.240]  And it's just absolutely nuts.
[48:13.240 --> 48:14.800]  So anyway, I'm actually saving money.
[48:14.800 --> 48:16.320]  So my thanks to Apple for.
[48:16.320 --> 48:17.920]  And they're all wearing fedoras, too.
[48:17.920 --> 48:18.420]  Yeah.
[48:21.360 --> 48:23.680]  I'm sorry.
[48:23.680 --> 48:26.800]  Some of my best friends are game developers, so please.
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.720]  That's just a joke.
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.600]  Don't send letters.
[48:30.600 --> 48:33.040]  I was a little, I was like, hmm, Monday?
[48:33.040 --> 48:34.480]  Why would they move it to a Monday?
[48:34.480 --> 48:37.280]  And it turns out last year's event was on a Monday, too,
[48:37.280 --> 48:38.200]  the mid-March event.
[48:38.200 --> 48:42.080]  And that's the one that I missed because my eyeball would
[48:42.080 --> 48:44.000]  have exploded if I got on a plane.
[48:46.880 --> 48:49.960]  So I missed that one, but it was on a Monday.
[48:49.960 --> 48:51.800]  We were talking about you doing a road trip.
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.080]  Right.
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.200]  It was under consideration that maybe I
[48:55.200 --> 48:57.800]  would just drive cross-country.
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.160]  No, but then the altitude was still a problem.
[49:01.160 --> 49:04.360]  Yeah, it was actually, it was like, getting on an airplane
[49:04.360 --> 49:05.120]  is like, oh, my.
[49:05.120 --> 49:06.680]  You needed to stay at sea level.
[49:06.680 --> 49:09.520]  No, I needed to stay at whatever sea level I was at.
[49:09.520 --> 49:10.480]  Yeah, right.
[49:10.480 --> 49:12.560]  So I needed to stay at Philadelphia Sea, which
[49:12.560 --> 49:13.200]  is very close.
[49:13.200 --> 49:15.640]  Well, I think you could have gone lower, right?
[49:15.640 --> 49:17.600]  I don't, I guess so.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.920]  Yeah, I guess.
[49:18.920 --> 49:21.200]  You don't want to go higher.
[49:21.200 --> 49:22.400]  Well, maybe not, maybe not.
[49:22.400 --> 49:24.520]  Maybe it would implode if you went lower.
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.160]  It would explode if you went higher.
[49:26.160 --> 49:29.240]  But the train ride from Philly to New York City
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.000]  was fine because it just doesn't go up, doesn't go down.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.600]  It's just New Jersey.
[49:34.600 --> 49:37.320]  But going through the Rockies would have been a problem.
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.280]  Going on an airplane was like, oh, my god, your eyeball
[49:42.280 --> 49:45.920]  will explode, and it'll be excruciatingly painful.
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.960]  Going up in elevation was like, maybe nothing will happen,
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.280]  but you don't really want to take a chance.
[49:53.280 --> 49:54.240]  Yeah.
[49:54.240 --> 49:57.920]  Well, I mean, anybody who's flown with a cold
[49:57.920 --> 49:59.840]  knows something about that, right?
[49:59.840 --> 50:02.280]  I mean, you know the effect that happens
[50:02.280 --> 50:04.520]  if you've flown with a cold, which is horrible.
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.320]  I mean, it's just like you're in constant pain.
[50:09.320 --> 50:11.840]  In the same way that the first time you've ever
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.880]  experimented with margaritas in your early 20s,
[50:15.880 --> 50:17.720]  and then you wake up and you say, I'm.
[50:17.720 --> 50:20.240]  It was my ties for me.
[50:20.240 --> 50:21.920]  The first time you've ever told yourself,
[50:21.920 --> 50:23.280]  I'm never drinking again.
[50:26.680 --> 50:29.760]  That's what flying with a cold is like.
[50:29.760 --> 50:31.360]  I've always gotten lucky in my life.
[50:31.360 --> 50:32.200]  I don't get sick that much.
[50:32.200 --> 50:32.960]  I'm pretty healthy.
[50:32.960 --> 50:36.960]  And I think I can only remember a handful of times.
[50:36.960 --> 50:39.440]  But I remember one time, man, my sinuses,
[50:39.440 --> 50:45.960]  it just felt like the dentist was going up through my eye
[50:45.960 --> 50:51.640]  to get to my teeth, like for the whole four-hour flight.
[50:51.640 --> 50:53.880]  Well, Jonas goes to a fancy school, right?
[50:53.880 --> 50:56.520]  So he doesn't bring a cold home.
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.000]  Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.720]  Hank goes to public school.
[51:01.720 --> 51:05.000]  I don't think there's any difference at all whatsoever.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.040]  Kids are disgusting.
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.160]  They're all disgusting.
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.040]  There's absolutely no.
[51:09.040 --> 51:09.760]  They really are.
[51:09.760 --> 51:12.160]  No, there's no difference.
[51:12.160 --> 51:13.440]  Jonas is pretty healthy, though.
[51:13.440 --> 51:13.920]  He's always.
[51:13.920 --> 51:15.040]  I think he got it from Amy.
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.400]  He's even healthier than I am, I think.
[51:18.400 --> 51:20.720]  But when he was kindergarten and first grade, man,
[51:20.720 --> 51:23.160]  we were all getting sick all the time.
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.400]  Terrible.
[51:25.400 --> 51:28.200]  Anyway, I thought that the Monday date was weird.
[51:28.200 --> 51:30.920]  Maybe they wanted Monday anyway, but the old rumor was for Tuesday.
[51:30.920 --> 51:33.400]  But it turns out that there's like a congressional.
[51:33.400 --> 51:35.640]  This is a very long talk show digression.
[51:35.640 --> 51:41.080]  Turns out that there is some kind of thing in Washington, DC
[51:41.080 --> 51:45.480]  on Tuesday the 22nd involving the Apple FBI thing.
[51:45.480 --> 51:47.120]  And so I think that they.
[51:47.120 --> 51:48.000]  Some kind of thing.
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.520]  Right, but they don't want to have product introduction
[51:52.520 --> 51:54.000]  the same day as that.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.520]  But now I saw today that Bruce Sewell is testifying tomorrow in DC.
[51:57.520 --> 51:59.280]  So maybe there's like two different things.
[51:59.280 --> 52:02.720]  I'm not quite sure what's going on there, but that there's a it just.
[52:02.720 --> 52:04.440]  Yeah, there are two different things.
[52:04.440 --> 52:05.680]  So what do you know what it is?
[52:05.680 --> 52:06.720]  Tomorrow he's testifying.
[52:06.720 --> 52:09.560]  I'm not sure what the difference is.
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.840]  I read both of them, but I can't think of what the difference is.
[52:13.840 --> 52:16.920]  Maybe the 22nd is an actual hearing or something.
[52:16.920 --> 52:17.520]  I don't know.
[52:17.520 --> 52:19.000]  Yeah, I think he's just.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.160]  Yeah, maybe he's just.
[52:21.160 --> 52:26.360]  I don't think his thing is necessarily public, but I'm not positive.
[52:26.360 --> 52:27.240]  Let's do it.
[52:27.240 --> 52:31.080]  And then the other the other thing is public is like in front of Congress,
[52:31.080 --> 52:31.600]  right?
[52:31.600 --> 52:34.680]  Yeah, that's tomorrow, which seems like a real shit show.
[52:34.680 --> 52:36.280]  Oh, the public one is the public.
[52:36.280 --> 52:37.640]  I think it's public.
[52:37.640 --> 52:38.160]  Oh, OK.
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.560]  It's the one that he already released an opening statement for.
[52:41.560 --> 52:46.480]  OK, that's the one where you're just parading before some grandstanding
[52:46.480 --> 52:51.080]  Congress people and you just have to sit there and listen to them yell at you.
[52:51.080 --> 52:51.760]  Yell at you.
[52:51.760 --> 52:52.080]  Sure.
[52:52.080 --> 52:54.120]  Or say whatever they want to say.
[52:54.120 --> 52:54.800]  Right.
[52:54.800 --> 52:58.720]  I think it's going to be a difficult day to be Bruce Swoll tomorrow.
[53:02.600 --> 53:03.400]  Tim Cook's done it.
[53:03.400 --> 53:04.840]  Cook has done it.
[53:04.840 --> 53:14.320]  I remember he did the taxes thing, which I think is at least the people who
[53:14.320 --> 53:16.560]  disagree with Apple's perspective on that.
[53:16.560 --> 53:19.560]  I think that they actually have a leg to stand on in terms.
[53:19.560 --> 53:22.920]  And not that Apple is.
[53:22.920 --> 53:25.560]  The people who disagree with Apple have a leg to stand on?
[53:25.560 --> 53:29.720]  Yeah, the people who say you should repatriate the money and pay your taxes.
[53:29.720 --> 53:33.600]  That there's some sense to the argument.
[53:33.600 --> 53:36.920]  You're not arguing like a fantasy thing, but.
[53:36.920 --> 53:37.400]  I don't know.
[53:37.400 --> 53:41.760]  I mean, I think in a way, they are, I mean,
[53:41.760 --> 53:45.840]  I think the argument about the iPhone is what the law is.
[53:45.840 --> 53:46.680]  Right, exactly.
[53:46.680 --> 53:47.360]  And there's.
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.640]  Whereas that's not as ambiguous with the tax thing.
[53:51.640 --> 53:53.440]  They are actually complying with the law.
[53:53.440 --> 53:57.280]  It's just that the law is letting them get away with murder kind of thing.
[53:57.280 --> 53:58.760]  Right, exactly.
[53:58.760 --> 54:00.200]  Tax murder, right.
[54:00.200 --> 54:03.720]  Tax murder, right, yeah.
[54:03.720 --> 54:04.280]  Right.
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.720]  Well, we'll collect all the taxes.
[54:05.720 --> 54:08.440]  The only way we wouldn't collect the taxes would be if some crazy company
[54:08.440 --> 54:12.800]  wanted to, I don't know, put $100 billion in an offshore account in Ireland.
[54:12.800 --> 54:15.680]  I mean, who's going to keep $100 billion in a, oh.
[54:15.680 --> 54:17.920]  How do we not think of that?
[54:17.920 --> 54:19.200]  Oh.
[54:19.200 --> 54:24.000]  Oh, that's because people in business wrote the tax law.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.800]  I can't help but think, though, that Apple's not happy about.
[54:26.800 --> 54:30.560]  And who knows, maybe this March 22nd thing with Bruce Will and DC
[54:30.560 --> 54:31.640]  will come and go.
[54:31.640 --> 54:34.480]  And people will be tired of the whole FBI argument by then.
[54:34.480 --> 54:37.320]  But I can't help but think that whatever caused them to change
[54:37.320 --> 54:40.240]  their date for this event, it's not good news.
[54:40.240 --> 54:42.480]  Because I think, even though it's a day before,
[54:42.480 --> 54:44.800]  I think they'd rather have like a whole week of,
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.600]  I don't know what you would call it, sunshine,
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.960]  where the news about Apple is this new iPhone and a new iPad,
[54:51.960 --> 54:55.680]  and maybe get people to stop talking about the FBI thing for a week
[54:55.680 --> 54:57.080]  and concentrate on the products.
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.240]  Whereas now, they've got 24 hours.
[55:00.240 --> 55:00.920]  Well, yeah.
[55:00.920 --> 55:03.460]  Or maybe they think that whatever they're announcing
[55:03.460 --> 55:07.320]  is going to be good enough that they're going to overshadow it a little bit.
[55:07.320 --> 55:08.680]  Or at least there's a chance of that.
[55:08.680 --> 55:10.320]  I just think you can't.
[55:10.320 --> 55:13.080]  It's sort of like a show must go on situation.
[55:13.080 --> 55:13.920]  It is what it is.
[55:13.920 --> 55:16.240]  And they obviously weren't prepared for this.
[55:16.240 --> 55:19.080]  I mean, one thing we know about this whole FBI thing
[55:19.080 --> 55:20.880]  is that Apple was taken by surprise.
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.520]  I mean, Tim Cook said on ABC that he found out about it after the press did.
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.280]  The press was notified about it before Apple was, which is, again,
[55:30.280 --> 55:32.440]  not the FBI's proudest moment, in my opinion.
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.120]  But with somebody who is Apple, who is not a criminal suspect,
[55:37.120 --> 55:43.920]  it's not like when Tim Cook acts as a little bit upset,
[55:43.920 --> 55:46.720]  I think rightly so, that Apple found out about it through the press.
[55:46.720 --> 55:49.600]  It's not like they're the subject of a criminal investigation.
[55:49.600 --> 55:52.880]  They're supposedly trying to partner with the FBI
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.680]  to do the best they can in this situation.
[55:56.680 --> 55:58.640]  They kind of got publicly sandbagged.
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.520]  So do we want to talk about guesses for?
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.080]  Yeah, maybe.
[56:06.080 --> 56:12.120]  But why don't I take a break, though, and thank our next friend to the show.
[56:12.120 --> 56:15.400]  This is a brand new sponsor, first time on the talk show,
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.680]  first time I've ever heard of their company called Squarespace.
[56:19.680 --> 56:25.240]  Squarespace is an all-in-one service where
[56:25.240 --> 56:33.280]  you can build, and host, and design, and create, and tweak your own website.
[56:33.280 --> 56:36.040]  Are you sure you're pronouncing that correctly?
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.000]  I don't have any notes on pronunciation, so I think it's all right.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.680]  We'll just have to go with what your gut you.
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.240]  I can't see it in front of me, so I don't really know.
[56:44.240 --> 56:45.200]  We'll go with your gut.
[56:45.200 --> 56:48.440]  It's just the two words, square and space, pushed up against each other.
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.200]  And the website is squarespace.com.
[56:52.200 --> 56:53.080]  All right, so you go.
[56:53.080 --> 56:53.840]  This is amazing.
[56:53.840 --> 56:54.720]  I've checked this out.
[56:54.720 --> 56:56.480]  It is absolutely, positively amazing.
[56:56.480 --> 56:58.960]  You go to squarespace.com, and you sign up.
[56:58.960 --> 57:00.960]  And number one, you can sign up, and you just
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.480]  get started before you even pay them.
[57:02.480 --> 57:05.800]  So you can just start building the website you're thinking about building,
[57:05.800 --> 57:08.600]  and then see if it actually turns out the way you want it.
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.560]  And then you don't pay until later.
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.320]  And they have all of these.
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.440]  I mean, when I say all of these, I mean,
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.040]  it's just an incredible number of professionally designed templates
[57:19.040 --> 57:21.600]  and starting points for different types of sites.
[57:21.600 --> 57:24.040]  Like maybe you're building a store.
[57:24.040 --> 57:25.960]  Maybe somebody else is a designer, and they're
[57:25.960 --> 57:28.400]  trying to build a portfolio of their work.
[57:28.400 --> 57:32.160]  Maybe somebody else is just trying to build a teaser page for an upcoming app,
[57:32.160 --> 57:34.720]  and you just want one of those pages that's just like one.
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.440]  The whole site is just one page, and it just
[57:36.440 --> 57:38.520]  gives you a teaser about what's coming in the service.
[57:38.520 --> 57:40.320]  Any of those things you could do in Squarespace.
[57:40.320 --> 57:41.320]  You can host a podcast.
[57:41.320 --> 57:42.880]  It's Squarespace.
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.400]  And they even have like an audio player and stuff like that.
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.440]  So you can have the people can hit play right there on the web page,
[57:50.440 --> 57:51.320]  everything like that.
[57:51.320 --> 57:54.160]  You can have a blog, all of this stuff, one service.
[57:54.160 --> 57:55.080]  They do the hosting.
[57:55.080 --> 57:58.320]  It's not like you build the site, and then they give you a bunch of PHP files
[57:58.320 --> 58:00.360]  that you have to go to a web host and upload them.
[58:00.360 --> 58:04.480]  No, Squarespace, the thing where you design it, it's all WYSIWYG.
[58:04.480 --> 58:07.640]  You do it right there, and then when you're done, you just say go public.
[58:07.640 --> 58:11.680]  And the thing that you were making, that just is your website.
[58:11.680 --> 58:12.560]  It's really amazing.
[58:12.560 --> 58:15.560]  I've never heard of anything quite like this.

[58:48.040 --> 58:51.720]  I think this company is going somewhere.
[58:51.720 --> 58:54.680]  Never heard of anything like it.
[58:54.680 --> 58:57.880]  Yeah, so prediction, what do you want to do, talk about what we expect?
[58:57.880 --> 58:58.380]  I guess.
[58:58.380 --> 59:02.860]  I don't know.
[59:02.860 --> 59:09.100]  I mean, it sounds like I don't think I have anything.
[59:09.100 --> 59:12.620]  I certainly don't have any other predictions other than what it seems
[59:12.620 --> 59:20.180]  like, what we already talked about, which is a smaller iPhone, an updated iPad,
[59:20.180 --> 59:27.420]  and Apple Watch bands, and maybe some faces or something, which I just added.
[59:27.420 --> 59:30.940]  I just made that up.
[59:30.940 --> 59:31.660]  Well, I did.
[59:31.660 --> 59:33.820]  I'm much more interested in talking about the fact
[59:33.820 --> 59:35.540]  that I am probably going to get this phone.
[59:35.540 --> 59:37.460]  All right, but that's a good.
[59:37.460 --> 59:42.900]  So we do know a lot, or we think we know a lot, thanks to Scoop Gherman.
[59:42.900 --> 59:45.660]  We don't know everything, though, and there's some interesting questions
[59:45.660 --> 59:46.180]  in there.
[59:46.180 --> 59:51.180]  So one of the things is that the rumor, and there's
[59:51.180 --> 59:57.780]  other sources for this, too, including who's that analyst?
[59:57.780 --> 01:00:02.420]  He's got good sources over in the supply chain, Ming something.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:02.940]  Ming-Chu Kuo.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.260]  Yeah, Ming-Chu Kuo has backed this up, too,
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.940]  that the phone is going to have the A9 system on a chip, maybe underclock,
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.860]  maybe not clocked quite as fast as on the iPhone 6 and 6S and 6 Plus,
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.740]  but same generation CPU as today's top-of-the-line iPhones,
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.980]  same generation, at least.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.020]  But so in other words, it's not like, hey, this is like a year-old tech
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.520]  phone.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.660]  This is like, hey, six-month-old phone.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.660]  It's only a half year off the main cycle.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.540]  But it won't, but it's not supposed to have 3D.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.100]  No, it won't have 3D.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.820]  I guess the one flagship thing that's missing is 3D Touch.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.900]  And who knows, maybe like the iPad, maybe like the iPad Mini,
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:47.780]  and maybe it'll have the year-old Touch ID sensor that looks exactly the same,
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.780]  but it works a little slower.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.300]  So it's slower.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.380]  Which I actually, I might upgrade to that.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:01:00.020]  Even after all of these years, I still get it.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.820]  That button is so much more convenient to just wake up the phone
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.700]  and look at the lock screen.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:10.620]  The problem is, Apple has made the lock screen so much more useful
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.280]  now that it shows your most recent notifications
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.100]  that I want to see the lock screen a lot.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.700]  And they've made it impossible to get to the lock screen
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:23.140]  using your thumb on the Touch ID button, because it's so damn fast.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.780]  So anyway, I wouldn't even call that a downside.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.540]  But I'm wondering.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.140]  I know.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.180]  I'm wondering.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.740]  I mean, our friend Albert complains about that too, but I don't.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.900]  I mean, if you, anyway, you can tap the side, but you can use the side button.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.780]  Or if you use the tip of your thumb instead of the flat part,
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.660]  you can get it to do what you want it to do.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.820]  I don't have a lot of patience for that argument.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.220]  It's not my strongest complaint against an Apple problem.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.300]  This thing is too fast.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:55.800]  Rusting.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.580]  My Porsche is just, it's just, this car is too fast.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.300]  It's too fast.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.660]  Good looking too.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.460]  Oh my god.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.020]  Nobody.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.180]  Makes me look terrible.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.180]  I look terrible standing next to it.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.340]  Nobody ever shuts up about how beautiful my car is.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.780]  It's terrible.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.020]  I'm curious, and this is the sort of thing that hasn't leaked yet.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.940]  What type of storage capacities is it going to have?
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:29.660]  Is this, I think that it's going to have a couple of options at $100 a part.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:35.020]  I had heard, well, at one point I had seen 1664, which
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.260]  is, I think, what most of them go, right?
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.780]  Well, don't they do 1632s?
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.340]  Oh no, that 32 is the thing we've been talking about for three years.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.380]  Right, right.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.740]  That's the terrible thing.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.900]  But that they won't have 120.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.540]  They're going to do that jerky thing that the rest of them do.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.620]  16 and 64 makes a lot of sense, I'm guessing.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.340]  And then the other big question is, how good is the camera going to be?
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:03.140]  And that's the sort of thing that it's, you know, the.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.060]  Yeah, and I understand that that's important.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.340]  I mean, that's important for lots of people.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.100]  It's not important for me, because I keep saying this,
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.900]  but I feel like the camera surpassed my ability to take a good picture,
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.900]  like, three generations ago.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:20.900]  So I'm happy going back to, I mean, certainly if it's the 6,
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.620]  I'm perfectly happy going back to that.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.940]  Even if it's like the 5s, I'm happy going back to that, too.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.780]  I mean, the only thing I think I would miss is 3D Touch, which
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.700]  I have come to rely on a little bit.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.180]  But I think for it to get a smaller phone,
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.900]  I will actually be willing to give that up.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.420]  Yeah, in a way, I can't wait to see how they do this
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.180]  and how Apple portrays the camera.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.500]  Like both, I'm most interested in how the camera actually is, of course.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.780]  But I'm very interested to see how Apple talks about the camera
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.580]  and the ways that it's, you know, what's good about it
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.580]  and how do they position it compared to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus,
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.060]  which by all accounts, and but just by common sense,
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.980]  because they're almost certainly going to be more expensive,
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.140]  have a superior camera.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.260]  I think it's going to wind up.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:10.220]  My guess is that it is its own camera, you know,
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.540]  that it's not like they took the camera from the blank iPhone
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.980]  and stuck it in this, that this device is different enough
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.780]  from anything that's come before it that it's got its own camera.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:26.300]  And where it falls on the spectrum is in some degrees technically measurable
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.260]  and in other ways is subjective.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.780]  Yeah.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.860]  I mean, you can take a side-by-side picture
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.380]  with the exact same lighting from the exact same spot
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.700]  and then compare the resulting files and look for things like noise
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:44.580]  and how bright it looks in low lighting or something like that.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.900]  But in other ways, you know, it's like you said,
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:51.580]  in a lot of ways, it long ago surpassed most of our abilities.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.100]  When the Shot with iPhone campaign started a year ago,
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.700]  when the best phone was the iPhone 6,
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.220]  there were people who shot photos that are way better than any photo
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:02.460]  I'm ever going to take in a million years with the iPhone 15.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.820]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.340]  Like 10 years from now, when the cameras are absolutely amazing,
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.180]  I'm never going to take a picture as beautiful
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.540]  as the one that Apple chose to put on a billboard
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.420]  that were taken with the iPhone 6 last year.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.380]  I mean, the people took some amazing photos with those things.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.660]  What's making you think that you want the phone?
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.140]  We've talked about that.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.300]  Yeah, just the size.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:30.420]  I mean, I've been unhappy with the size of the 6 and the 6S.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:35.220]  All things considered, and maybe even like up to, again,
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.300]  to bring up the year anniversary date, up to 13 months ago,
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.580]  I wouldn't hesitate.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.380]  I would be waiting in line to get the 4-inch phone.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.580]  Here I have one on my desk.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.980]  I just keep it here to make me sad.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.220]  I have my iPhone.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.380]  Yeah, I have actually, yeah, my regular desk.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.060]  I have my iPhone 5S right here, and now I've got it in my hand,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.100]  and I'm in love.
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.340]  I love the way this device feels in my hand.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.260]  My big thing.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.340]  Sometimes they pick up a 4 and think, man, that's really nice, too.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.780]  I expect to really love the feel of this phone.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.940]  My thing is with my vision.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.940]  The combination of I've got one bad eye and then my good eye
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:13.260]  is really running into the mid-40s presbyopia.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.060]  I need reading glasses.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.140]  And so the bigger size of the other one.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.220]  But on the other hand, I keep thinking to myself,
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:25.780]  I don't run my 6 in the big screen mode.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.220]  Yeah, neither do I, and my eyesight's going, too.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.140]  So I wonder.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.620]  Maybe I'll see less, but I was always fine with that.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.660]  And most of them, honestly, I'll tell you the truth.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.100]  Most of what I read on the phone is Twitter.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.540]  So the fact that you don't see a lot at once is fine,
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.260]  because the whole tweet is always there,
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.580]  and you just sit there and flick your thumb.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.540]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.620]  Yeah.
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:53.620]  The one thing I do like about the 6S is how, apart from,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.380]  we talked about the lock screen thing, but in general,
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.380]  it's just crazy fast.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.740]  Well, and this should have the same thing, right?
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.340]  Even if it's a slightly underclocked A9,
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:09.580]  it still should be way faster than even the iPhone 6.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:12.780]  And I think a lot of the things that the iPhone, that the A9
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:18.140]  makes feel fast, like you just don't wait for stuff,
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.940]  I would guess will be true on this new phone.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.620]  Yeah.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.140]  And maybe, yeah, I mean, even if it's underclocked,
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.420]  maybe the smaller screen makes up for it.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.060]  Because there will be fewer pixels to push.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.580]  So anything that is graphics constrained,
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.860]  it's going to be easier.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.420]  Everything should be easier.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.780]  I'm just holding this phone here.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.620]  And the thing that just strikes me
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:43.740]  is there's a reason why I never dropped one of these.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.580]  And I have dropped.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.660]  I haven't dropped my 6S.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.860]  I've never dropped my 6S.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.380]  But I did drop my 6 last year twice.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.020]  I had two drops and broke both times.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:53.660]  I have not.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.460]  I have been lucky enough not to drop it.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.260]  But I feel uneasy about it all the time.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.540]  But this feels like the type of phone that you can,
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.660]  you just walk around anywhere.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.700]  You just walk around with the phone in your hand.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.900]  Don't worry about it.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.740]  It's never going to come out of your hand.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.580]  I think people, everybody has their own set of parameters
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.620]  that they want to satisfy.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:17.180]  And I mean, some people would rather have a large phone
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.900]  and maybe not have an iPad.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.060]  I mean, it seems like there's probably a lot of people,
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.780]  which is maybe why the iPad isn't doing as well.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.820]  I think that's a huge part of it, huge part of it.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.900]  Yeah.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.100]  I would rather have a small phone and a big iPad.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.900]  Right.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.420]  Yeah, I think that for some people,
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.060]  maybe they don't buy iPads because it's
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.060]  like, eh, I've already got my MacBook Air or whatever
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.380]  I walk around with all the time.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.620]  But I definitely think that for a lot of people.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.140]  I know.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.660]  I know this.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.380]  It's not even a thing.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:44.700]  I know.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.540]  I've heard from them.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.220]  They email me.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.620]  They write to me on Twitter, an awful lot of people who,
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.820]  especially the Plus users, who are like, this is my iPad.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.660]  I read books.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.700]  I don't need it.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.700]  And it's so great.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.100]  And this is an argument that we've
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.420]  had ever since PowerBooks first came out.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.060]  And it's gotten so much better over the years with Dropbox
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:07.900]  and stuff like that.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.820]  But the trade-offs between having multiple devices
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.340]  versus one device, if you've got this one device,
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.860]  you just know it's already there.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.220]  And for however much the cloud, for Dropbox or iCloud documents
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.060]  and all that stuff, has gotten easier.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.860]  And it continues to get easier.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.020]  And IMAP for email instead of POP for email,
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.180]  and all these things that keep stuff so that you can
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.780]  keep multiple devices in sync.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.940]  If you just have one device, you just know it.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.060]  And it's almost like you get that muscle memory.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.900]  If you spend all of your time on one device,
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.020]  it's like you just get faster and faster,
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.420]  and you don't even think about it.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.940]  Yeah, it used to be a big decision point
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:50.780]  between whether you got a fast laptop
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.540]  or you got a slow laptop and a fast desktop.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.380]  Right.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.180]  Right.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:55.660]  Yeah.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.700]  Yeah.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.980]  I used to talk about that on the show in the old days,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.700]  long, all the time.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.620]  Yeah.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.700]  And I went back and forth, and it never was on one side.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.700]  I've done it both ways.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.380]  And the trade-offs were so complicated,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.540]  and it was so hard to make that decision.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.100]  Yeah.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.740]  And I feel, for the most part now,
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:19.500]  I've just been relying on a fairly fast laptop,
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.260]  but not super fast.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.380]  I mean, I got into this problem.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.220]  But I wanted to play Firewatch, and it would not play on it.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.540]  It doesn't play on my laptop.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.620]  And I didn't have a PS4.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.180]  So eventually, I had to play it.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.700]  I played it on my son's computer.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.740]  So I had to buy.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.660]  That was the fastest computer in the house.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.500]  So I had to buy a PS4.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.940]  Yeah, I thought about that for a long time.
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.620]  And then all of a sudden, it hit me, wait,
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.940]  I could use my son's computer.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:46.620]  Oh, man.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.340]  Did you like Firewatch?
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:48.860]  I did.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.460]  I liked Firewatch quite a bit.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.380]  Let's come back to it later.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:50.660]  Yeah.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.780]  You remind me of Firewatch.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.740]  Yeah.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.100]  Because I don't think I've talked about it on this show.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.100]  I talked about it with Topolski on his show.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.540]  But I didn't talk about it here, I don't think.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.260]  So that also brings us, though, to the iPad, the new iPad Pro,
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.060]  which is supposedly coming.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.980]  That the replacement, I guess, or the next generation
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.780]  of what we now know as the iPad Air, Scoop Gherman
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.980]  says they're going to call it the iPad Pro.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.260]  And then just put parentheses 9.7 inch.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.620]  Which, in addition to the fact that, I mean,
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.940]  Gherman's record is pretty good.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.860]  And the closer we get, the more likely
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.260]  that the leaks are accurate.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.660]  I think it passes the common sense test.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.180]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.140]  I mean, I don't think, it doesn't sound outrageous.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.900]  Not that Apple hasn't ever released
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.900]  a product that fails the common sense test regarding its name.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.540]  But in this case, I think it makes sense
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:51.820]  that the iPad Pro is an iPad that, what
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.180]  are the features of the iPad Pro?
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.300]  Four speakers, or at least stereo speakers.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.620]  I think you have to have four, though, because otherwise you
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.660]  can't turn it around sideways and still have it in stereo.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.900]  So no more just one big speaker.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.300]  It's four speakers, you get stereo.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:12.380]  Pencil support, I don't know what else.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.100]  The keyboard.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.540]  Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.420]  And the little thing on the side,
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.660]  the new port for the smart keyboard.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.380]  Yeah, that's the big one.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.580]  And any iPad that has those things is an iPad Pro.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.980]  And you just pick which size you want.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.180]  Yeah, I mean, if they're putting those things in that,
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.380]  it certainly doesn't make any sense
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.780]  to call it the iPad Air, even if it's the same size.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:37.940]  And so the other argument is just call it the iPad.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:42.060]  But then you don't really get that sort of branding effect
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.060]  of, like, but it's got all these other things
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.380]  that go along with the iPad Pro.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:45.700]  Right.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.580]  I think the difference, and so for example,
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.460]  obviously the MacBook shows that Apple
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.660]  is willing to just have a product that
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:57.820]  is without a modifier, no adjective, just the product,
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.060]  the family name.
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.260]  I think the difference is that the iPad Pro has
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.260]  these flagship features.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.980]  Again, whatever size iPad Pro is,
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.180]  the big one that we already have or this new one that
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.420]  is supposedly imminent.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.460]  But it has the smart keyboard adapter.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.660]  It has pencil support that these things make it a Pro.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.660]  Whereas the MacBook doesn't really
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:22.020]  have anything, except it's extraordinary weight and size.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.740]  I didn't mean to be that dismissive of it,
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.980]  but that there is no thing that the MacBook does
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.940]  that you would call a Pro feature.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.740]  No, certainly not.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.940]  If anything, it's the opposite.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.380]  Not that it's a bad device.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.300]  Amy and I, Amy just saw one for the first time.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.740]  I did not get a review unit or anything of that.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.700]  So I've never used one except in a store.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.060]  And we were in an Apple store the other day,
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.740]  and Amy saw it for the first time.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:55.740]  She was like, what the hell is this?
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.100]  She honestly didn't really, I think she might have heard of it,
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.660]  but she really hadn't realized.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:06.100]  And she said it, it was both with disdain and kind
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.180]  of impressed.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.620]  Like, this is amazing, but why would anybody buy this thing?
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.020]  Why not just buy an iPad?
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.540]  That was her take.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.340]  I said, well, people want a keyboard.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:18.020]  And she goes, but this keyboard sucks.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.660]  And I was like, well, that's, you know, that's a,
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:25.300]  our family, everybody in the family is pretty hardcore,
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.060]  pretty hardcore on the keyboard.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:27.900]  We're not like that.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.900]  We're not like that.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.660]  I tried that.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.420]  I mean, I've used that keyboard, and I would easily
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.940]  switch to that keyboard.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.380]  And I would, I like that device, and I like the trackpad.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:40.780]  But I'm hoping that the next one will be at least a little more
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.260]  powerful and possibly maybe have another port.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:46.020]  I think that could, I think it would be a huge upgrade.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.220]  I think that, I think it's got to be so much faster.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.980]  I think that, I think the first one was about putting a flag
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.300]  in, a stick in the ground and saying,
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.340]  this is how thin and light these things should be.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.460]  And now they've got a year to actually get the tech
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.620]  to actually support it.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.940]  Yeah.
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:04.580]  But anyway.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.940]  Because yeah, my, so my, I've got a 10 inch, is it 10 or 11?
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:10.180]  I can't remember.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.340]  The small air.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:11.980]  11.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.700]  And yeah, OK, 11.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:18.540]  And I've had, it's a 2012.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:21.380]  So I'm kind of holding out.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.140]  I thought, I really thought about buying,
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.820]  buying a new computer in the fall.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:29.420]  But I thought, I got to see what that next MacBook is going to be.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.460]  I think the next MacBook, I don't know anything about it.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.860]  I just suspect that it's going to be very compelling,
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.180]  especially if you can get by with the keyboard.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.900]  I could, I'm sure I could adjust to the keyboard.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.940]  Any hardware keyboard I could get used to.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.940]  It's, it, I mean, you're not going to use that keyboard at home anyway.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.300]  No, no.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.980]  But sometimes when I'm using, I obviously do most of my writing
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.060]  at my desk with my big old clickety clack keyboard.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.060]  But when I am traveling, though, sometimes I actually
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.060]  have to do a lot of writing.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:55.860]  Like I'm more.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.380]  Your, your steampunk keyboard.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.940]  The only reason I am traveling most, half the time
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.700]  is because I have something to write about because it's an Apple event
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.660]  or whatever.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.180]  Yeah.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.860]  The big question that people have, we have to get to it,
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.220]  is what is the pricing on the iPad Pro going to be?
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.340]  The new, this new smaller one.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:19.100]  Is it going to be as in the ballpark of the expense of the big one?
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.700]  In other, and then therefore meaning that they would.
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.180]  And Tim Cook's Apple.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.580]  I mean, it is obvious, this is obvious to anybody who even pays
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.340]  half attention to the company.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.020]  One of the differences between Tim Cook's Apple and Steve Jobs' Apple
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.100]  is that Tim Cook's Apple keeps the older ones around longer,
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:41.980]  as opposed to wiping the family clean and saying, oh, you like the,
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.860]  you like the iPod Mini?
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.340]  No, we don't make it anymore.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.940]  It's gone.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.860]  Yeah, I mean, it was the most popular thing we made.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.620]  Yeah, single, actually it's the most popular thing this company's ever made.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.140]  Yeah, but we, we took all.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.140]  How do you like that?
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:56.700]  Guess what?
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.420]  We actually had a bunch of them left, and we dumped them in the Pacific Ocean.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.700]  Because that's how much, that's how much I like this iPod Nano better, right?
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.740]  That was Steve Jobs.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:12.540]  I think it's almost certain that the iPad Air 2 will stay around
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:18.260]  in some way at 16 gigabytes and at some kind of, you know, lower price point.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:20.420]  I would, I would be flabbergasted if they don't,
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.980]  because it would be so out of character for Tim Cook's Apple.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:27.420]  The question, though, is with the
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.140]  the big iPad Pro, the one that's already out, the 12 inch one,
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.420]  the 13 inch, whatever it is, it starts at $799.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:37.340]  But boy, you know, that's the 32 gigabyte one with Wi-Fi.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:44.220]  If you want cellular, you're up to $1079 for 128 gigabytes.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:48.100]  And those are your only options on the, the existing iPad Pro.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.100]  You have, just have three to choose from.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:55.780]  32, that's Wi-Fi only, 128 with Wi-Fi only, or 128 with Wi-Fi and cellular.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.940]  So in some ways it's commendable because it's a lot,
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.060]  a lot simpler of a product matrix than a lot of Apple's other products.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.820]  But on the other hand, boy, that, you know,
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.620]  I'm not quite sure how much less
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.940]  this one will cost if the only difference is the display.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:15.140]  And does that leave a hole in the lineup where the main, you know,
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:20.060]  people who want to spend five or 600 bucks on an iPad
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.900]  are still buying the iPad Air 2? Lots and lots of people on Twitter asking me,
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.700]  what do I think this thing is going to cost? And I really don't know.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:31.260]  I'm terrible at, I'm terrible at that.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:37.260]  Yeah, it seems, is the base iPad still $16 for the Air?
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.700]  Well, let's see.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.020]  I'm trying to...
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:48.140]  Well, they still sell, right?
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:48.860]  Talking about yourselves.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.020]  Right now they still sell.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:56.620]  Yeah, so $16, so $16 is the, is the $500 iPad Air.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:02.500]  For what did I say? Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.700]  Then it goes to $16, $64, $128.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.380]  They've got iPads.
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:11.380]  I mean, if you just look at the compare, I mean, I guess I'm almost sure.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.180]  I would hope that at the very least they're going to get rid of the iPad Air 1.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.260]  That's gone.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:21.380]  And they'll just have two iPad minis, the Mini 4 and the Mini 2
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.140]  in all these different configurations.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:28.220]  And then, I don't know.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.900]  Is it a previous and current?
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.820]  Is this a problem?
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.500]  I don't know.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.860]  I guess I would maybe suggest...
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.620]  It's just weird.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:38.140]  I don't think it's like, well, I mean, clearly iPad's having problems,
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.140]  but I don't think it's the fact that there's an iPad Air 2.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.820]  No, and it's easy to get started either.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.980]  Like if you walk in a store and you don't know which one to buy,
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.300]  it's easy to get started by saying, well, which size one do you want?
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.540]  And then people can start by saying, well, I just, I want this size.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.340]  And then from there, it's already simplified dramatically.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.820]  And the picking between the colors, that's not a complicating issue.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.340]  That's just, that's easy, right?
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.220]  You just know which one you like better and you pick it.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:07.300]  That doesn't, I don't count that, like if there's three colors available,
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.860]  I don't count that as tripling the complexity.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.940]  And then when it comes to, to me, the toughest decision
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.060]  for somebody who's getting an iPad is do you get the Wi-Fi
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.580]  or do you get the Wi-Fi in cellular?
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.260]  That to me is a really tough one.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.020]  And when family members ask me advice.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.780]  I don't have a problem with that because, I mean, I,
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.620]  because to me I would just use tethering.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.380]  Right, from your phone.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:34.980]  Yeah. So I don't, I never, I will never buy it.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.060]  I mean, until a cellular capable iPad again probably.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:42.980]  I do. I buy them because, and Amy does the same thing,
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:46.700]  that we both have AT&T iPads and we have Verizon phones.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.580]  And when traveling, that can be.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.940]  Yeah, I can see that.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.780]  I've been, I should keep track of it though.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:58.980]  I have found though, anecdotally in the last year, I have found
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.140]  that fewer and fewer times do I need to worry.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.500]  You know, that the Verizon signal at airports and stuff
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:09.700]  like that is good enough that I don't find myself doing that.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.980]  Well, I've always found Verizon's coverage to be better than AT&T's.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.180]  So if I were to do it, I would probably, can you even do this?
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:23.940]  I would do Verizon phone, which is what I already do, and then T-Mobile.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:27.300]  Yeah, I would get, if I get a new iPad, next time I buy an iPad,
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.620]  if I do get cellular, I'm going to buy T-Mobile instead of AT&T.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.940]  Yeah, because then you'd be like, you're in downtown someplace
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.300]  and you can get like wicked fast.
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.940]  And you also feel like you're giving your money to a company
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.740]  that actually maybe you feel good about giving some money to.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.380]  Yeah.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.820]  I kind of regret that I didn't switch our phones to T-Mobile.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.820]  And at this point, what?
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.420]  Well, yeah, and you guys are downtown.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.300]  Like, you're in a pretty well covered area.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:58.820]  I wrote a, I did a review of phones last year for,
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:06.260]  or not phones of cellular providers in the Seattle area.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.980]  And so for Tom's hardware.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.980]  And so they sent me all these phones
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.140]  and I drove around and tried them in different areas.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.300]  And T-Mobile came up the best.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.100]  And so I was like, oh, maybe we should move to T-Mobile,
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.700]  but not at our house.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.060]  That was the problem.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.140]  Downtown Seattle, it was crazy fast.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.260]  It was fantastic.
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.860]  But when I drove home, no, couldn't get a signal.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:31.300]  I mean, couldn't get a good signal.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:34.340]  So here's the price lineup of the iPads now.
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:38.580]  So the Wi-Fi ones go from 400 to 700.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.700]  And that spans the gamut from iPad Air 1 with only 16 gigs
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.140]  up to 128 gigabyte iPad Air 2.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:53.140]  Can they just replace, can they do an iPad Pro at the 9.7
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:57.700]  in size that's in this 500, 600, $700 range?
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.340]  I don't know.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.060]  It's.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.180]  I think they won't.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:00.980]  It's a big.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.780]  I think it'll be, I'm going to guess, here's my guess,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.660]  and it's worth what you're paying for,
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:13.300]  is a 16 gigabyte iPad Pro.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.580]  No, I don't think they'll do it.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.300]  I don't think they'll do 16.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.340]  No, you don't think so?
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.620]  Oh, no, no, no, that's right.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:17.860]  That's right.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.420]  No, I know that.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.940]  I actually came up with this earlier,
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.620]  and I'm misstating what I thought.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:22.420]  32.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:29.540]  It'll start at 32 at 600, and then it'll do 64 at 700,
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.260]  and then 800.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.020]  Maybe they'll do like the other Pro, though,
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.620]  and just jump right to 128.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.180]  I don't know.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.700]  That's a big jump, though.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.140]  Maybe they want to have those $100 increments,
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:43.060]  because that jump and that jump is 250 bucks.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.020]  So with the big 13-inch iPad Pro,
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:51.620]  it goes from 800 to 950 if you go from 32 to 128.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:55.060]  So with the current 13-inch iPad Pro that jumps from 800,
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.220]  I'm going to skip Apple's Goofy 99 numbering.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.980]  I'm going to add $1 to every price.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:03.380]  It goes from 800 to 950 to go from 32 to 128.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:08.820]  So it's only $150 gap when you go all the way from 32 to 128.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.220]  Can they go $200 by going 32, 64, 128?
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.420]  It seems weird that the bigger one could go from 32 to 128
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:26.580]  for quote unquote only $150, but then the 9.71
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.740]  would go in $100 increments?
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.580]  I don't think the 9.71 will go.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.300]  Well, I think maybe it won't go to 128.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:33.780]  Right.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.540]  Well, but the iPad, no.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.740]  It'll be 32, 64.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.980]  No, the iPad Air 2 already goes to 128.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.940]  Yeah, I know.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.980]  But that'll, oh, yeah.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.740]  Don't annoy me with these facts.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:45.460]  I don't know.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:45.940]  Who knows?
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.820]  Maybe they'll simplify and just go 32, 128.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.380]  I don't know.
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:54.100]  They have a $150 jump in there.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.420]  And then if you want a 16-gigabyte jump,
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.820]  you just buy the Air 2.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.940]  Right, buy the Air 2.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.900]  I think Pro definitely starts at 32.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.660]  And it's totally, and again, and it's such a big difference
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.100]  given that iOS itself is around like 8 gigabytes
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.140]  or something like that.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:14.580]  Like the usable space difference between 16 and 32,
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:19.380]  it's way bigger than the numbers alone make it seem.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.580]  Yeah.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:24.900]  Now, you get a special edition 32, 32.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:29.940]  Special edition 340-gigabyte device, right?
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:34.420]  But I've been getting 64 for most everything now,
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.100]  and that's been great.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.580]  Whereas for a while, I was struggling with 32.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.820]  I could get by with 32 even.
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.220]  It's hard now.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.580]  Yeah, because there's some, I don't even play a lot of games,
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.620]  but a handful of games, or if you load up on movies
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.460]  for a flight or something like that.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.540]  64 is the sweet spot for me for an iPad,
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.660]  where if I have 64,
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.060]  I don't think I'm ever going to run out of space.
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:02.820]  And if I do, I think there'd be some kind of,
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.820]  I can delete like the whole season of Mad Men
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.260]  that I already watched or whatever.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.620]  There's something that I can delete
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.980]  to easily free up the space.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.180]  And I just don't have to worry about it.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.380]  And one of the reasons, and I have to say it,
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.740]  I don't want to go into a whole digression about it,
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.020]  but for me at least,
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.300]  the way that iCloud photo library works,
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:26.020]  and that it just downloads the files when you need them,
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:27.140]  and you don't have to use it.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.100]  It's like, I feel like I can get all my photos on my iPad,
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.580]  and I don't have all the space taken up
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.580]  with all my photos on my iPad.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.460]  It really, I hate to say it,
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.620]  but it's a service that Apple really nailed.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.860]  It does what it claims to on the tin.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.500]  Here's a weird one.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.620]  I still don't use it.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:48.340]  Here's a weird one.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:51.780]  The iPad Air, this is so weird.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:54.100]  The iPad Air, the one, the iPad Air 1,
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.140]  if you get the Wi-Fi only model, or either model,
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.940]  the two sizes are 16 and 32,
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.620]  and they're only separated by 50 bucks.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:04.900]  Like, yeah.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:05.700]  Really?
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:10.260]  $399 to $449, and then the cellular one is $529 to $579.
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:11.940]  For the two?
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.500]  No, no.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.940]  iPad Air 1, iPad Air 1.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.500]  Yeah, they're one.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:15.460]  Okay.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.980]  But it's like, man, for 50 bucks,
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.580]  just get rid of the 16 gigabytes.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.220]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:20.740]  I don't know.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:25.140]  Yeah, I mean, they must, there must be, well, I don't know.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.700]  I was going to say, they must think they have a reason,
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.860]  but at the same time, they're not selling as many iPads.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.540]  All right, and it's not even $100 upset.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.180]  Maybe they are doing the wrong thing.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:34.980]  Just 50 bucks.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.700]  So the iPad, so that's the big question,
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.420]  is what are the new iPad, this new iPad Pro
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.660]  that's only 9.7 inches, what is it going to cost?
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:45.380]  Is it going to be $100 more than the comparable Air 2s
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.500]  right now because it's got all this fancy new stuff?
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:49.300]  I don't know.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.740]  Well, the other thing is, I probably want it to be $100 more
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.220]  because I just bought an iPad Air 2 in the fall.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.860]  Which is just perfect timing.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.740]  You would also like to have a sharp edge
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.420]  that gives you a nasty paper cut.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.420]  And a shock, it'll give you a shock every once in a while.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.100]  And it only gets two hours of battery life.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:13.300]  And it runs extremely hot.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.980]  I'm pretty sure that's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:19.480]  Right.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.180]  We're releasing it in February because it's a lot warmer.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.220]  It'll keep people warm.
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.820]  I guess they're releasing it in March.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.380]  No, March.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.180]  Yeah, March.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:29.220]  There'll be March tomorrow.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:30.820]  But not yet.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.340]  When we record it.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.140]  When we record it.
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.140]  I saw a thing today.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.180]  We'll probably never record on Leap Day again.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.660]  That's right.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.020]  We'll record podcasts again.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.420]  But it's, you know.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.140]  It seems right.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.820]  Yeah, the chances are slim.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:50.180]  The chances are pretty slim that you and I will ever record on Leap Day again.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.660]  And a Monday night is not also unusual.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.820]  It is a little bit.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.940]  I saw a thing today that said,
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.460]  I guess I should write this down and put it in the show notes.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.420]  See if I can find it again.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.300]  That births go way down on Leap Day.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:16.740]  And not just C-sections, where you would think that there'd be some control.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.740]  Because a lot of times when the mother has a C-section, you can kind of plan it.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.340]  And you can be like, eh, we'll do it tomorrow.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.460]  But even natural births, even vaginal births, go down on Leap Day.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.060]  Which would suggest that...
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:32.740]  Well, aren't there supposedly little things that you can do?
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.940]  Apparently there is.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.580]  And the graph, it's not subtle.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.180]  It's really, really serious.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:45.140]  Yeah, because my sister-in-law, I remember, I think one of the kids was late.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:48.420]  And the doctor said, go home and have a glass of red wine.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:48.900]  Really?
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.580]  And so she did.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:55.700]  And 24 hours later, new kid.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.900]  Would you mind having a Leap Day birthday?
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:03.220]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:08.500]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:13.780]  I mean, as opposed to, if I had a choice as to have one or not, I would say I would rather
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.260]  not.
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:23.460]  But like, my son's birthday is just a few days after Christmas, which I think is lousy.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.980]  It's a bum draw.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.380]  Amy's is a handful of days before Christmas.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:32.660]  And trust me, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:35.300]  And trust me, I've heard that it's a bum draw.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.740]  Well, she said she's at a bum draw on Christmas.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:44.500]  So the way that they do it, the way they do it is if your birthday is February 29, you
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.460]  celebrate on the other years, you celebrate on March 1.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.100]  And to me, that's the thing.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:57.620]  And as a kid, I see the logic of it, where your birthday is the day after February 28.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.820]  But one of the things that I think puts a sour taste in people's mouths with a leap
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:10.260]  day birthday is, I think it would make more sense to celebrate it on February 28 and say
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.340]  that your birthday is the last day of February.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:15.780]  Because to me, part of your birthday is the month.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.180]  You know, like, are you a March person?
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:19.540]  Are you an October person?
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.900]  Are you a December person?
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.260]  Oh, near Christmas.
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.860]  You know, it's the month matters.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:28.100]  And so even if you're at, like, the last day of the month, it's like you feel like you're
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.100]  a February birthday person, right?
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:30.660]  And that's how the...
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.160]  Yeah.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.180]  Isn't that how the old horoscopes work?
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.540]  Do people still do horoscopes?
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:37.460]  Well, sure.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:37.940]  Some people do.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.380]  But it's like the cutoff date is the month, though, right?
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.620]  So like, what, all of a sudden you're not a Pisces anymore?
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.500]  Now you're a whatever the hell it is?
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.820]  Well, I guess it's the month you were born in.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.860]  I just feel like it changes the feel on that.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:59.300]  I guess in general, I guess I'm glad I wasn't born on February 29th.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:04.100]  I think people who, you know, I think people who are pulling shenanigans not to have a
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:05.700]  baby on the day, I don't know about that.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:14.740]  You're glad you're going to burn that day, but you don't think anybody should avoid it.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.780]  Yeah.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:21.220]  Well, should avoid it.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:21.780]  That's typical.
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.140]  That's typical.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.060]  I've got mine thinking.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:28.180]  I got my birthday that occurs every year.
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.580]  It's February 29th for the rest of you suckers.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.380]  I might have mentioned this on the air before.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.700]  Have I ever told you about the time Michael Lop missed his birthday?
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.340]  No, I don't think so.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:44.420]  For Webstock, two years ago, three years ago, last time I went to Webstock.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.420]  Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.220]  Because he flew around the world.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:51.700]  A friend of the show, a good personal friend of mine, Michael Lop, was going to Webstock.
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:57.060]  I was going, and Michael Lop got on an airplane in California the day before his birthday
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:03.060]  and flew over the Pacific and got off the plane in New Zealand the day after his birthday.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.200]  Damn it.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:13.140]  And Jonas came with us that trip because it coincided with like the fall break for his
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.660]  school, or spring break for his school.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:21.460]  And Jonas was just astounded, just absolutely positive, he was like eight or nine at the
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.340]  time, just astounded that this could happen to you.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.460]  You could lose your birthday.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.100]  You could get cheated.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:31.700]  Because when you're a kid, however much you love your birthday throughout your life, when
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.860]  you're a kid, your birthday is a national holiday.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.140]  You're not getting cheated out of the last Snickers.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.420]  You're getting cheated out of your goddamn birthday.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.180]  And he came back and then it was like, you come back and it's like, you got, you know,
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.980]  I guess he missed like, it was like, there was, he had a bunch of days off, but he still
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.020]  missed a day or two school in it.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.180]  So it's like, you know, what'd you do on your trip and whatever.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.260]  And the whole discussion was about my dad's friend who lost a birthday.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.300]  And all of his friends are like, what?
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.580]  And he like explained it.
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:03.060]  And then the teacher was like, oh yeah, the international date line.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.020]  And like, they got out of math.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.820]  They had like a little thing in school and they like kind of learned how it worked.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.140]  And his class was just like, this is outrageous.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:14.020]  You know, like it was like the civil civil rights issue of the third grade.
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.020]  It was absolutely outrageous that this man lost a birthday.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.020]  They're having, they walked out of school that day.
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.300]  He had a sit-in outside.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.500]  Oh.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.980]  Get Michael, get Michael Lata's birthday back.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.900]  It's a hell of a thing though.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.660]  It really hurts my head when I think about it.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:40.020]  The international date line, it's still, I tried to, I understand it enough, but it's
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.140]  like, it's still, it seems like there should have been some point where he was somewhere
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:44.260]  where it was his birthday.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.580]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.980]  It doesn't make any sense, but that's what happened.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.060]  No, you can miss the whole day.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.540]  See, what happens is you come back and you get an extra day.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:54.820]  Like you'll get like two.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.180]  But not that day.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:59.220]  No, you don't, you don't get to get.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.420]  You don't get to redo.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:00.980]  All right.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.580]  I want my extra day to be last Friday.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.300]  You don't get that.
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.740]  What else do, what else is supposedly coming for this event?
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.540]  Apple watch straps and stuff.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.100]  Straps.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:14.580]  It seems like, I don't know.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.100]  Yeah.
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:16.500]  Boring.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.660]  Do you have, do you have, uh, multiple straps for your watch?
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:20.660]  I do.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.260]  I have, um.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:22.820]  You don't wear it.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.820]  Oh, but you famously don't wear your watch anymore.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.780]  I wear it some days.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.100]  I do.
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:28.420]  I, no, I read, no, I read that.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:32.100]  You did.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.340]  I have, you must be mistaken.
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.700]  I have the space black link thing.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:42.180]  And, uh, 95% of the time that's the band I wear.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.860]  Cause I actually find that metal bracelet the most comfortable.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:51.300]  Um, but I have two of the, uh, uh, floral elastomer ones.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.180]  I have the black one, which I bought when, uh, when I ordered to watch.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:58.900]  And then I bought the orange one when they came out with new, uh, new, uh, flavors last
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.400]  fall.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:09.700]  So I have, I have the original, I have a space black aluminum watch and the original black
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:10.820]  band.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:17.700]  And then for my birthday, I got a leather band off Etsy, um, which actually has some
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.020]  pretty cool, pretty cool bands.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:20.260]  Yeah.
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.420]  I think one of the reasons that those, uh, you know, the third-party ones from like an
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:28.100]  Etsy or a small company are so good is that a lot of these people have been making watch
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.180]  straps for a while anyway.
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:32.580]  So it's not, they're not like getting into something new.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:36.820]  Um, you know, and they were very, they were very nice.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:41.380]  I mean, cause my wife bought it for me for my birthday back in November and you know,
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.740]  they were very concerned about, you know, like as it fits, send it back.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.540]  If it doesn't fit well, we can, you can adjust it.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:54.580]  And so, um, you know, it's like, there's that group of people who have been doing this for
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:59.540]  a while who already have like customer service and you know, they're good at that stuff.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:36:59.780]  Yeah.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.780]  And I think that the difference between something like an iPhone case is that you really want
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.700]  an iPhone case to be engineered with these incredibly accurate tolerances.
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.460]  And otherwise it just, it, it's either hard to get it in and out of the case or flip,
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.540]  you know, it just doesn't fit right or whatever.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:20.580]  Whereas a watch strap isn't really about, um, precise sub millimeter perfection around
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:25.860]  your wrist because it's obviously, you know, even, even you yourself, your wrist is slightly
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:31.620]  different diameters on different days based on, you know, whether I'm retaining exactly,
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.940]  which is usually, yeah, that's most bloated.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:42.820]  You are, uh, I eat a lot of salty food, you know, and it's about what makes a watch strap,
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.860]  a nice watch strap or a bracelet, a nice bracelet is other things.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.740]  And it's, you know, how it feels and, you know, subjective things.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.940]  And, but you know, like the leather ones, it's, you know, how good are you working with
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.260]  leather?
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:56.900]  And some of these, you know, like that's little mom and pop places on Etsy that just work
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:57.300]  with leather.
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.180]  They're experts.
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.140]  They're really, really good.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.500]  Right.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.700]  It's a lot of them in Texas, a lot of them in Texas because they have a lot of dead cows
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:03.940]  there.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.780]  It's an interesting fact.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:12.740]  Uh, yeah. Um, but the one thing that I've really enjoyed about the watch is, is, and
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:18.020]  it made me think about this compared to every other watch that I've ever owned is how fast
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:18.980]  you can change the band.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:19.620]  Yeah.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:23.380]  Because I, because I do this because I don't want to work out in my leather band, but I
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:25.540]  want to wear the Apple watch when I work out.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:32.500]  So I just quickly switched back to the flouro elastomer and, you know, and it takes like
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.140]  five seconds.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.940]  Yeah. It's you pronounce it a black place.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.220]  No, it's true.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:44.100]  That's, you know, and for all the pixel, all the complaints that I have levied against
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:48.260]  Apple watch, the one thing is absolutely true is the brilliance of that switching mechanism.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.140]  And it's, you know.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:49.940]  Yeah.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:52.500]  I mean, I, I mean, I think all watches should.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.220]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.500]  It's a lot of the, you know, the people who are the biggest appraisers of it are people
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:59.940]  coming from the watch world where they're like, in some ways, Apple really say what
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.940]  you want about the functionality of the watch itself.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:08.660]  Leave that aside. But in terms of some certain things like making bracelets and the design
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.180]  and the switching and stuff like that, they just showed that the Swiss industry had been
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.660]  asleep at the wheel for decades because they, they haven't really, you know, like the top
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:21.700]  of the line watch strap from 1981 is like indistinguishable from the top of the line
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:22.820]  watch strap now.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.380]  Yeah.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.860]  And you need a little tool to be able to switch it.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:29.220]  And, you know, there's a really good chance that you're going to shoot the little metal
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.420]  spring thing across the room when you lose it.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:32.900]  Right.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.500]  That's a, that's horrible.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:41.060]  Uh, or like on a link bracelet on a Swiss, most Rolex or an Omega or a Tag Heuer, um,
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:42.980]  you don't just need a little tool.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.660]  You need like a special little screwdriver, but you actually have to have like, you really
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:50.580]  ought to use like, there's a certain kind of glue that you want to put in there.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.460]  When you put it back in, you like to take a link out to resize it.
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.220]  And then when you put the screw back in, you want to put, I forget what they call it.
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:01.300]  It's called like Loctite or something like that, but it's like a jeweler's glue that
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:05.140]  will, it's just enough so that it's never going to come out when you don't want it.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.540]  But if you eventually want to resize the watch again or put the link back in, it's not so
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.380]  tight that you can't get it out or strip the screw.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.740]  It's like perfect glue.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.500]  Well, who the hell has that?
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:14.820]  Right.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:18.580]  So just to get the thing resized, you're off to the jeweler, you know, your local corner
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:19.460]  jeweler or whatever.
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:20.980]  Yeah.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.500]  So anyway, I don't know what the,
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.380]  yeah, I don't know what they're going to, so what they, they were, one of the rumors
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:35.780]  was about a nylon that they would ship a nylon band, which I would be very interested in.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:35.940]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:39.300]  I have a watch with a nylon band, very comfortable in my opinion.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:39.540]  Yeah.
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:42.980]  That's what I wore for years before I got the Apple watch.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.140]  Yeah.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.900]  I'm curious to see how Apple does the connection to the watch on that one though, because I
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.700]  feel like the ones that I've seen so far, they don't quite look right because of just
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.740]  the nature of the, the connector to the watch that they just kind of, they don't quite look
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:00.900]  right with just like a, a bar sticking out of the bar, the bar.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:01.380]  Yeah.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:01.620]  Yeah.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:05.780]  Well, that's what my, I mean, that's what my leather one uses and it's, it's okay.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:07.380]  But yeah, but I don't think Apple would.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:07.460]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:11.380]  But somehow with the leather ones, the bars don't, they don't look as out of places with
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.260]  a nylon strap.
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.780]  I think cause leather is typically a little thicker and it pads out a little.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:19.140]  And whereas the nylon ones are, you know, makes the bar show a little.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:19.540]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.180]  Yeah.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:20.420]  Yeah.
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:25.220]  It just somehow the, the interplay between the thickness of the strap material and the
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.140]  bar just doesn't seem as right to me.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:29.220]  I don't know how they're going to do it though.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:33.060]  Like what are they going to, maybe it's just, you know, Jeff Williams comes out and talks
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:38.660]  about how many, you know, millions of people are using health care and great new apps from
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.980]  these airlines and people are Apple paying with their watch 10 million times a day or
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:43.460]  whatever.
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:47.460]  And then here's some new bands and get off the stage, which is sort of, I guess what
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:53.700]  he did in September, although they also had Apple, you know, the OS two, the Apple, the
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:58.100]  watch OS two to show, whereas I don't think anybody's expecting a new watch OS.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:02.740]  So no, I mean, maybe they have something in secret, some secret new feature just so they
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.980]  have something in demo, but I'm not quite sure.
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.460]  It seems well, new faces would be nice.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.940]  And that seems like something that would be simple to do, but that's, I am completely
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.500]  making it right.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:13.380]  That's a good idea though.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:16.980]  And some, that's something that if it's, I don't know what the version number was, but
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:21.460]  the version number would be watch OS 2.1 or whatever that they, they could be, they could
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:22.660]  have been working on in secret.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.860]  And it's, you know, no surprise that they, that it didn't leak.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.420]  Is this enough?
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:29.220]  This is my question.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:35.300]  I keep thinking that after I spent all this money to book an airplane is, is it enough
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:44.660]  to justify the money that you, well, is, you know, it's, it's a phone that is in, then
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.020]  there's leaks of the case too.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:46.900]  I think it looks interesting.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.740]  It's an interesting combination of the straight sides and the curves, and they got rid of
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.940]  the chamfered edges and have just like a rounded edge.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.220]  It seems like an interesting case design, but fundamentally technology wise, it's a
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.980]  phone that has nothing new, right?
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:06.740]  It's a size we've had before a basic shape we've had before camera technology.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:11.780]  That's, you know, it's beneath the cutting edge of the success and, you know, a screen
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.580]  that we've seen before and an A9 system on a chip, which is great that it's the current
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:17.620]  model year, but guess what?
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.900]  We've already had, you know, we've had these phones for six months with the A9.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.620]  And then an iPad that is the exact same story.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:28.980]  It is this, you know, everything that's new and novel about it was in the 13 inch iPad
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.460]  Pro that we have had since November.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:32.660]  Right.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:36.980]  So how do you do, how do you, what do you do on stage to talk about these things, right?
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:41.780]  Like here's this thing that is exactly like what we announced in September, but smaller.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:42.980]  That's a tough event.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.380]  Like, and then what?
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.660]  Here's new watch straps.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:53.940]  That seems like a tough event, even if they, you know, and one thing about Apple, and I
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:58.500]  say this and I really mean it, and it's kudos as somebody who's, especially when the town
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:01.940]  hall events, oh my God, that's like, it's like a coach seat in an airplane.
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.220]  It's not even, it's tighter.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.220]  It's like a tighter fit than a coach seat in an airplane.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:10.340]  If they only have 48 minutes of stuff to talk about, they'll have a 48 minute event and
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.780]  maybe, you know, a five minute video.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:13.780]  Right.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.220]  But they're not going to keep you there for two hours if they don't have two hours of
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:17.460]  stuff.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.660]  I just don't know what else they're going to do.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:24.260]  I mean, I guess some people are wondering, hoping sort of maybe that maybe there's new
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.700]  Mac books of some kind.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.740]  I don't know how that aligns though with like what Intel is putting out.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.860]  Intel meaning the CPU company.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.140]  Right.
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:33.460]  Right.
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:38.900]  Yeah, I can't think of any other shoe that's in the air that is ready to drop at this point.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.740]  It's like, I wonder how close they were, if this, if there's nothing else that's
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:48.740]  coming, I wonder how close they were internally to doing it without a, an event and just having,
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:53.940]  you know, giving it to people, you know, review units, you know, in private briefings like
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:58.660]  they've done it, other things when there's no, uh, yeah, and, you know, maybe there's
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.460]  something else or maybe they, you know, they feel like they've done it, you know, they
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:06.100]  feel like this is good enough to, uh, you know, maybe for reasons that escape me and
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:09.700]  are not obvious to me, maybe there's something, there's some message they have to give that
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.940]  actually, you know, makes for a compelling event.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:21.060]  Oh, the, um, wasn't there a, uh, an update to Apple music coming too?
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:24.580]  Ah, I don't know if it's coming in March though.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:25.060]  Right.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:25.540]  Okay.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.420]  Uh, on, yeah, I don't, I mean, I don't know that either, but I, but I had heard, you know,
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.820]  but I had heard there was a podcast, there was an update coming and that supposedly
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.300]  much more understandable.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:43.540]  And there was a podcast that Eddie Q was on where he said that there's an update to the
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:45.540]  remote app for the Apple TV.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:46.900]  I forget what show was.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:47.940]  Yeah.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:50.100]  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't listen to podcasts.
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:56.740]  If they want to just sort of do a run through, you know, here's all of our stuff and we're,
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.420]  you know, here's a little, you know, things big and small, the little improvements we're
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.540]  announcing to all of our stuff.
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:06.740]  If they want to run through Apple TV, um, you know, demoing the new app that lets you
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.740]  use your phone as a full fledged, you know, Apple remote.
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:10.980]  Yeah.
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:16.260]  Well, and maybe, maybe they have some third party thing that's tied into that, right?
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:21.780]  I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Eddie Q's hint that that's coming is a March event
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:25.060]  thing because, you know, it just gives them something to demo.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.820]  Like, so at least announce, I mean, at least they would announce it and say when it's
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:29.460]  coming.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:33.380]  But if they had like a game or something like that, where if two players need a remote,
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:37.220]  now there's a solution to it because one of you can use your phone and the other one can
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:37.940]  use a remote.
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:39.860]  Was that just a few weeks ago?
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.380]  Uh, yeah, I think so.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:42.340]  Yeah.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.900]  So he said three months, right?
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.500]  I thought he said a few months, honestly.
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:47.700]  Okay.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:48.580]  So maybe not.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:51.300]  I mean, I think he said, he said three, I thought he said three, but it was kind of
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:52.340]  like, just like tossed it out.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:57.780]  I mean, not like, you know, he was not, I don't think that date was necessarily supposed
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.780]  to indicate that that's exactly what it was.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:00.020]  Yeah.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.060]  He maybe doesn't even know.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:04.660]  I hope he made it up.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:05.460]  What am I?
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:09.140]  I really hope that he just made that up on the spot and just thought, you know what?
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.100]  We should have that.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:14.420]  And I really hope that like after the podcast, he was like, I had to go to the, no, he had
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.940]  to go to like some engineers and say, okay, you got to make, you got to make the iPhone
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.700]  app, do everything that the crack, the whip, you got to do everything that the remote
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.100]  does.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:22.420]  Why?
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.660]  Because I just said we were going to do it in a few months.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.740]  This is why they don't, they didn't use to let people talk.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.820]  But it's funny to think about it.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.260]  And because we don't have video, right?
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.900]  It was entirely conducted by audio remotely.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:40.580]  So wouldn't it be funny if like Federighi was like, Craig was like, giving him like
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:43.300]  the throat cut motion, like there, what the hell?
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:47.060]  Like just didn't say anything because he's, you know, in front of a hot mic, but he's
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.380]  just looking at Eddie like, what the hell are you talking about?
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:52.660]  I don't have anybody working on that.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:53.540]  How hard could it be?
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:54.580]  Yeah, right.
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:57.540]  If that's like what Eddie gives him, like, he just gives him a look, like what?
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:01.620]  Just get the, get those crossy road people and then we'll be fine.
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:03.940]  It's worth an announcement.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:12.420]  It seems like, I mean, well, I mean, I like my Apple TV, but I don't really play games
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:15.300]  on it other than the few that I played when it first shipped.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.020]  I've done it.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:17.620]  I don't anymore though.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:18.580]  Yeah.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:21.460]  Not because, but that's just cause I don't play games period, except for Firewatch.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:23.220]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:31.620]  But it just seems like they need to do something else to make that, to kickstart that a little
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:31.780]  bit.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.740]  Is there anything else that was supposedly coming?
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.420]  Smaller iPhone, revamped iPad, tweaks to the Apple watch line.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:42.660]  I know.
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:50.020]  I mean, you know, there's the loft mentioned video streaming thing, but that doesn't seem
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:56.660]  like that's any closer to fruition than it has been for a while.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:01.140]  No, and it doesn't seem like something that they would do at town hall.
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:06.500]  And it's, again, we don't know that it's a town hall, but all the hints seem to suggest
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.300]  that it is.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.260]  And the fact that everything else is so small would, you know, reiterate it.
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.060]  Yeah, I said before, I think I blogged it.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:17.700]  I don't think I said on the show, but if it is a town hall, I think there's a very good
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.500]  chance that this will be the last public event for the press that Apple ever holds at town
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:22.740]  hall.
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.900]  Because if they stick to last year's schedule, they'll, the next time we hear from Apple
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.620]  will be at WWDC and that'll be at Moscone.
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.340]  The next time we hear from them will be in September.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:39.220]  And that'll be a big, big, big, big show in a huge venue because it's going to be the
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:43.540]  new iPhone and probably a new Apple Watch 2.0.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:47.460]  But anything else they're going to do this year, and the iPhone one is always a big deal,
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:48.820]  is way too big for town hall.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:54.420]  And then starting last year, they didn't have a little small October event.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.700]  The September event was, here's everything we've got for the rest of the year.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:02.740]  And privately and from other people, I've heard that that was very, that was not coincidence
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.340]  or circumstance, you know, happenstance.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:05.300]  It was strategy.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.700]  It was doing an event in September.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:12.420]  And then another one, even if small in October, is too big of a pain in the ass.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:14.660]  And, and, and to, I would think so.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:21.140]  So then that rolls, then the next time we hear from them would be March next year.
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:24.260]  And by that time, supposedly the new campus is going to be open.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:25.140]  Right.
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:29.780]  And it seems like if it's really close to being open, it would be almost criminal to
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.140]  have an event at the old campus like, oh, welcome to our old crappy campus.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:39.620]  You should take, you should, you should take a, like a big 48 ounce malt liquor and just
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.420]  pour it out right on the, right on your seat when you're done.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:46.500]  I've done that at most of the events at town hall.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:48.660]  I forgot.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.820]  That's your, that's my signature move.
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.020]  Your signature move.
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:57.860]  I even, that's how I saved my seat for the next event.
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.140]  Nobody wants to sit there.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.140]  Gotta invite John back.
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:03.620]  Uh, I don't think there's anything else coming up.
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.300]  I don't think there's anything else, maybe a Mac book.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:05.940]  I don't know.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.740]  But anyway, I don't know.
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:08.020]  Do you think that's a good event?
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.060]  Do you think it's gonna be a weird event?
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.740]  Well, I think it's going to be a good event because I'm very interested in this phone.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:14.660]  Um, but.
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:18.500]  I'm really curious how they, other people's mileage may vary.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:21.780]  I'm really curious how they, how they position the phone.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.300]  In addition to my previous statement that I'm interested in, how they talk about the
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:30.660]  camera, I'm interested in how they talk about the size, you know, because it was, it was
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:37.220]  was, uh, I mean, they were never able to say, starting with the six, they were never able
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:43.540]  to say, now we have a big phone, small phones suck because they've always, they've always
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:47.460]  still had the smaller ones in the lineup filling out price points.
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:48.900]  So they couldn't really bad mouth them.
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:55.780]  But it was also clear that ever since they went to the six, that the, that the smaller
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:01.220]  phones were years old models that were being moved down to different price points as they
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.100]  got older.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:07.060]  Whereas now they're coming out with a four inch phone that, you know, they're obviously
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.980]  not going to say that this is a top tier.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:14.340]  It's not the six S mini, you know, it's, it is different, whatever they're going to call
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:14.580]  it.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:17.780]  Um, you know, and the camera by all accounts is not quite as good.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:22.820]  So no matter what, it's, you know, it's some sort of couple of, um, but it's also definitely
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:26.900]  new and it's got cutting, you know, cutting edge, a nine, et cetera.
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:31.700]  So I'm curious how they talk about why they, why they're adding a four inch phone with
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:33.620]  these current specs.
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:39.300]  You had said something, you had written something about how you think that this phone is going
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:41.700]  to be around for 18 to 24 months.
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:47.700]  Now that I think about 36 months, probably because at the third year it will be at the,
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.460]  the $0 price range.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:50.900]  Yeah.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.700]  But I'm interested.
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:59.140]  I mean, I mean, if they do call it the, the se without a number in it, um, is this, they're
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:04.020]  just going to keep, are they going to keep upgrading that line?
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.340]  I don't know.
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:10.020]  In line or are they just going to just going to have this phone and move it down?
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:13.220]  And then maybe like three or three years ago from now.
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.340]  And then have some other, you know, have the XE or something.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.620]  I was going to say XE.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:18.340]  I was going to say it.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:22.420]  iPhone sexy.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.020]  Yeah, I think that's what they'll do.
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:29.380]  I think it's a one-off phone, sort of like the, the iPhone 5C was.
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:31.140]  I think if they do that, they need to pay us.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.220]  I think if it's called the iPhone, I think if it's called the iPhone XE, that, um, you
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:43.300]  and I should both get at least, you know, not much, you know, just like, uh, some, some
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.260]  basis point.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:44.740]  1%.
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:45.300]  1%.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.100]  Yeah.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.460]  Well, you know, it doesn't even come on.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.100]  Don't be greedy.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:53.300]  1%.
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:55.300]  How much could that add up to?
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.340]  50, 50 basis points.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:58.580]  How much could 1% of iPhone sales add up to?
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:01.460]  Yeah, right.
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.660]  It's an unknowable number.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:04.980]  All right.
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:10.100]  Let me, let me take a break here and thank, uh, our third and final sponsor of the show
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:17.940]  and another one that I could not be happier to encourage you to, uh, to do business with
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:20.180]  our good friends at mail route.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:26.580]  Now to find out more, you can go to their website is mail route.net slash TTS.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.980]  The initials of the talk show, TTS mail route.net TTS.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:36.580]  Um, look, these guys are the email masters.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.060]  These guys, the company is founded by and run by people who've pretty much devoted their
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:47.860]  careers to handling email, filtering email, protecting your email, doing email, right.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:54.100]  And it departments everywhere are expected to do more every year and with less money
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:54.580]  every year.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:55:01.380]  And that includes really important stuff like, uh, stopping spam and virus attacks and, you
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:05.540]  know, shitty, uh, you know, phishing attacks and stuff like that, that come through your
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:12.900]  email, uh, uh, and end of life announcements for trusted hardware and software options
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:16.900]  that helped you make this in the past, make these decisions even more difficult.
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:17.140]  Right.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:20.420]  So first Postini went away now, MX logic.
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:24.020]  Now I've never heard of MX logic cause I'm not an it professional.
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:28.260]  Uh, I can only guess though that it had something to do with rich, you know, dealing with your
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:30.420]  MX records for your email domain.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:33.060]  Uh, well, whatever it was, it's been announced end of life.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.260]  So who do you trust now to do the job well and stick around?
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:39.220]  Uh, well, I say you try mail route.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:44.420]  Mail route will protect your email, your company's email, your team's email, uh, and your own
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:47.220]  hardware against spam viruses and other attacks.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:50.340]  Because what mail route does, there is no hardware to install.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.780]  You don't install mail routes hardware.
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.020]  You don't install their software on your server.
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:56:00.340]  What you do is if you own the domain, you just change your MX records to focus the email,
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:02.260]  have the email go to mail route first.
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.780]  It's just a thin filter.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:04.580]  It just filters.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:09.220]  And then it moves right on after mail route gets done, taking all the crap out of your
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:13.220]  email, all the spam, all the phishing attacks, everything like that.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:16.100]  It just forwards onto your existing servers.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.100]  Uh, the spam free email that you want.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.580]  So you don't have any of the crap on your servers.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:27.140]  Mail route takes care of it, filters that they've got API's so you can script it.
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:31.620]  You can, you know, hook it up to whatever other systems you have, uh, connected to your
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:32.260]  email.
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:38.580]  They've got really great, uh, interface to do things like double check, you know, make
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:43.220]  sure all the spam that they filtered really is spam, uh, that sort of thing.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:46.740]  You can get like an update like once a week that says, here's all the top emails that
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:50.340]  we filter to spam, but that maybe we're like on the threshold.
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.260]  So if you want to double check them, here you go.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:53.380]  Here's your report for the week.
[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:56.100]  And you can like eyeball it and take a look.
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:02.100]  Uh, and just like, uh, the other companies I talked about today, you get a 30 day free
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:03.620]  trial of mail route.
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:09.140]  You can just go there, try it, change your MX records, filter your email through mail
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:10.820]  route, see how good it works.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:15.940]  And then after 30 days, only then after you've tried it for 30 days and you see for yourself
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.500]  how good this is, then you can start, uh, uh, start paying for it.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:26.580]  Listeners of the show, this is an amazing deal, get 10% off for the lifetime of their
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:27.220]  account.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:33.620]  So if you sign up through mail route.net slash TTS and you use them for 15, 20 years, you
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:38.580]  are still getting that 10% off 10 years from now, 15 years from now, however long it is,
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.740]  which is a tremendous, tremendous deal.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:45.380]  So if you are in charge of email for your domain, your company's domain, you owe it
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:45.780]  to yourself.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:49.780]  Go check out mail route at mail route.net slash T T S.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:52.260]  I love these guys.
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.940]  Uh, what else?
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.940]  Before we talk mail, it's mail, it's mail route.
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:58.900]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:01.460]  We've had that discussion before.
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:08.580]  Uh, well there's, there's that game we could talk about.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.900]  Route and route for that word is one of those ones where I don't even know how I pronounce
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:13.140]  it.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.780]  If I'm not thinking about it, I do know that I sell mail.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.220]  I say mail route.
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.340]  It's really contextual.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:23.140]  Because you say routes, nobody would ever say, no one would ever say route 66.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:27.540]  Yeah, but, but if you were saying like, what, what route do you take to get to, to get to
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.100]  mom's house?
[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:31.060]  I would probably say route, I guess.
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:36.340]  I know that I deliberately say mail route with mail route because I feel like it would
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.820]  be so easy to think that it's root.
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:43.540]  Like you're the root admin admin route because root is a very common word in networking.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:46.980]  And even if I spell it, I just feel like, let me just put it in your head as mail route
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:50.580]  and then anybody out there who wants to check it out will know how to spell it.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:55.060]  And nobody, there's no ambiguity, but there's most of those words where there's two ways
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:55.860]  to say it.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:59.300]  I, I, I have very strong opinions about the right way to say it.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.740]  And what about the tomato, tomato thing?
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:07.620]  I've never met anybody in my life ever who says tomato.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:08.340]  Who says tomato?
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:08.980]  Yeah, ever.
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.940]  No, it's like the guy, the guy who made that song up, he just made that up.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:16.260]  No, I bet some British people say tomato.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:20.020]  Yeah, or like some real, real jerk.
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.980]  And plus that was like a, that was like a hundred years ago.
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:23.460]  Right.
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:27.060]  And like it was like at a time where like people who, you know, like when only like
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:32.020]  5% of Americans had been to college, they just started saying words funny, like, you
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:38.020]  know, like it's sort of affecting a fake semi sort of one toe in the sand British accent
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:41.940]  just to like sort of self identify as someone who'd been to a college on the East Coast.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:45.540]  I bet it was like a good sign, like, you know, like if you're working in a restaurant
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.660]  that, or a bar or something like that, if you have a customer who says something about
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.340]  tomatoes, you just know you're in for it.
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:54.580]  Stick your thumb in that drink.
[01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:00.900]  Did you, did you have a, a guy in like the senior year of college who, because there
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.460]  were lots of people spent their junior year abroad and there was a, there was a guy who
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:09.300]  came back senior year of college who had spent the year in, in England.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:12.020]  And he came back speaking with a British accent.
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.860]  No, it happened to me in sixth grade.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:22.900]  We had a good friend of mine in, uh, Mark, his dad got transferred to England after fourth
[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:23.380]  grade.
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.380]  And, uh, I think he, I know he missed all of fifth grade.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:28.980]  He might've missed part of fourth grade too.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:32.580]  He was, maybe he was gone more than a year, but then sixth grade, everybody was excited
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:36.820]  because Mark was back and he was a popular kid, real nice kid, smart kid.
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:44.020]  And he came back and he didn't really have a British accent, but he was, he said bloody
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:44.420]  everything.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:46.980]  Okay.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.700]  That I can get.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:47.940]  Yeah.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.420]  Cause that's a really good, that's a, that's one of the great.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.060]  Yeah.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:54.740]  That's like, that's like a, and, and at that age, it's like a square that you can get away
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:54.740]  with.
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:56.020]  It's like, you can really get away.
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:57.300]  You can get away with a British square.
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.540]  It was, it was, and he really pulled it off.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:04.260]  Like we made fun of him at first, but then it just like, and then you were doing the
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.900]  mock up, no, cause you couldn't pull it off it.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:09.780]  If we tried it, we'd look like, you just couldn't do it.
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:14.020]  But he, he, you know, it just came out of his, it just came out naturally.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:16.100]  It's like, he, Hank says bloody.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:16.660]  Oh man.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.460]  That's a good one.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.300]  He says, I mean, I, and I think it's, I think it's from listening to those, those, uh,
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:21.860]  Minecraft.
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:22.420]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:23.380]  They're all English.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:23.540]  Yeah.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.100]  That's true.
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:24.340]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:25.300]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:25.700]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:26.740]  That's a brilliant word.
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:27.300]  It really is.
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:29.940]  Brilliant to do English.
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:30.340]  Brilliant.
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:30.980]  Also brilliant.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.660]  I think that was subconscious right there.
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:35.540]  The brilliant, the English make terrific use of the word.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:35.940]  Brilliant.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:37.140]  We do have that word.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.580]  Yeah, but they, they use it better.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.900]  We have bloody too, but we don't have it in there.
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.980]  No, but it's not used in the same way.
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:48.580]  It's just so smack dab in the middle of, boy, it sure feels like a swear word.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:50.900]  And no, I cannot make it.
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:54.180]  I can't make a compelling argument that it is a swear, but it just has.
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:55.140]  No, it's not here.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.420]  It's not a swear word.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:58.020]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.020 --> 02:01:58.980]  Firewatch.
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:01:59.940]  Oh man.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.140]  I don't play games.
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:05.700]  And I don't know if that makes me a better critic or, or not critic even,
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:10.020]  but a better person to tell you to go buy this game and go play it or, or not.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.140]  But I think it kind of does.
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:15.220]  It's like, I just don't have the mindset for, I just don't have the.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:18.260]  Well, yeah, I think it depends on the kind of gamer you are.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.380]  I mean, if you're like, you know, if you're someone who likes
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:25.300]  first person shooters exclusively, you might not like.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:26.260]  Well, maybe you would though.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.100]  Maybe you'd like it as a, as a break.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.660]  Well, sure.
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:32.900]  Yes, that's, that's perfectly possible.
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:37.220]  Um, if you are exclusively addicted to that particular genre, however,
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:41.620]  I mean, and I, you know, and I read some of the comments on, um,
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:46.420]  Steam from some people, which, you know, just made me angry because it wasn't
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:52.020]  exactly the game that they are continually playing all the time.
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:58.020]  Instead, it actually had a story and it was interesting instead of just like
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:00.180]  shooting zombies repeatedly.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:03.940]  Uh, but did anybody, was anybody misled?
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:05.700]  I mean, I don't understand.
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:10.180]  I guess you, well, there was that, there was a, there was a sort of ridiculous
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:11.780]  situation with this game, right?
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:17.140]  Because there was someone who, who wrote a review and I think it was on
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:20.660]  Steam who was, or it was in the forum someplace and I can't remember if it
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:26.420]  was on Steam or what, but it was saying, you know, I paid the $17 or whatever,
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:30.660]  and I had a good time playing it for the amount of time that I spent playing it.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:32.740]  But I'm thinking about getting my, trying to get my money back.
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.860]  You paid the money, you liked the game, and you're thinking about getting it.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:45.940]  So I, I don't, I want to scrupulously avoid spoilers.
[02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.100]  I mean, the basic gist of the game doesn't spoil anything.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.740]  And it's pretty obvious that you play a, uh, I don't even know what the hell you are.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:53.860]  You're not really a forest stranger.
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:54.340]  What are you?
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:55.140]  Firewatcher.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:59.220]  Yeah, so you're, you know, you're up in a tower and you're in the Pacific Northwest
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:01.700]  and you, uh, you know, your job is to...
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:04.260]  I think it's, I think it's, uh, Wyoming.
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:05.060]  I think it's supposed to be Wyoming.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:12.980]  And, uh, and the story unfolds and it is, uh, fascinating to me.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:15.540]  Number one, it's a beautiful game.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.020]  It really is just drop dead gorgeous.
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:20.260]  And, um, what's his name?
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:22.100]  Ollie, Ollie Moss.
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:24.180]  Have you ever seen the Ollie Moss's Star Wars posters?
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:24.900]  I guarantee you.
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:26.260]  I think, I believe I have.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:27.460]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that I have.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:33.140]  So, uh, Ollie Moss worked on, on setting the, the graphics of the game to some degree.
[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:35.940]  And it really shows, um, the whole team though.
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:37.220]  It's just a gorgeous game.
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:42.900]  You just cannot, I would watch a short film, uh, or not short film, an animated film.
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.620]  I'd watch a feature length film that looked exactly like Firewatch.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.620]  It's, it's just got a tremendous look.
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:48.100]  Um.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:52.100]  Well, I think the thing that I like so much about it is how it draws you into the game.
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:55.460]  Um, because it starts out, it doesn't start out with any graphics at all.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:05:00.100]  It just starts out by asking you certain questions about the choices that you're going to make.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:04.580]  Um, except that it's all setting up the story.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:09.540]  It's getting you, it's drawing you into the story and it's, you're, you know, by the,
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:15.540]  by the end of answering the questions, you know, you're, you're choked up.
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:19.060]  Yeah, it sets you off in a melancholy frame of mind.
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:23.140]  Uh, and the game is so well written.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.820]  It's, it really, and it's, it's not trying to be a movie.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:30.500]  It's not trying to be a, uh, choose your own adventure book.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:35.140]  It's a game and you're playing it and you're there and you've got, you know, like just
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:40.660]  a fundamental difference from like a movie is, you know, if it takes a long time to walk
[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:43.060]  from A to B, it takes you a long time to walk from A to B.
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:47.540]  That you don't cut, you know, I mean, you cut days out of the adventure, but you know,
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:48.500]  it's, you're there.
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:55.220]  And so you've got like this, you know, first person view that, that feels like you're there.
[02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:58.820]  It feels like you're doing stuff, but it's obviously you're, you're in a story that is
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:06.900]  really well written with, um, some really intriguing characters and incredible acting
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:07.540]  talent.
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:16.420]  Um, the guy who plays, uh, the voice of the, the protagonist, it was, uh, uh, the guy from
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:19.940]  Mad Men who played Harry Crane on Mad Men, uh, Rich Sommer.
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.380]  And he's just, he's terrific.
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:23.620]  He was terrific in Mad Men and he's terrific here.
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:26.020]  It's a, it's a really remarkable character.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:28.260]  And the other characters in the film are remarkable too.
[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:34.260]  And the mystery is, is truly interesting and it's just, uh, evocative.
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.220]  Yeah.
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:40.260]  And it leaves, I mean, I hope, hopefully for me, I mean, I hope it leaves enough on the
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:42.660]  table that there'll be something following.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:48.660]  I could not, I mean, I really hope, I really hope I would, I mean, I would shell out again
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:52.660]  immediately since I figured out that I can play it on my kid's computer.
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:57.460]  Uh, so it is also a little adult.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:05.140]  Um, I, but not, well, yeah, I mean, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:08.900]  and that was one of my questions I, I, um, asked Cable.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.980]  I was trying to figure out if it was, before I put it on my kid's computer, I wanted to
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:13.860]  make sure it was okay.
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:20.020]  And he's 12 and, and it's, you know, it's, it's very thoughtful.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:24.500]  And, um, and I think in a good, in a good way, whoops, sorry, Siri.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:27.300]  Um, I think in a good way, it's thoughtful.
[02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:31.140]  Um, and then the only, I think the only thing that some people might object to is there's
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:32.100]  some swearing into it.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:34.340]  There's actually a fair amount of swearing in it.
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.660]  But, but there's not much other than that.
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.860]  I think that that's, I think that is bad for a kid.
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:44.340]  No, I let, uh, Jonas play and I was really, really interested if he would take to it or
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:51.060]  not because Jonas' other interests involve games like Destiny, uh, and a little bit,
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.740]  a little bit more action packed.
[02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:57.780]  Uh, he, I tell you what, I think he took to it immediately.
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:01.540]  Not maybe not like the, I think maybe that, like you said, the opening words, just text
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:02.980]  maybe struck him as weird.
[02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:07.460]  And we were watching together, I watched him play when he and, and I said, well, maybe
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.620]  the game is loading, maybe it's downloading content or something.
[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:12.260]  And he put up with it and it does, it doesn't take a long time.
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:16.980]  But then once the game started, I think he was a little skeptical of a game where there's
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:20.580]  no weapons and, or at least it doesn't seem like there's any weapons.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:25.620]  Um, but the graphic quality absolutely opened his mind to it because it's like, he could
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:27.220]  see that, wow, this is a good looking game.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:33.780]  And he took to it and he, he beat the game and a lot of his time it took me to beat it.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:39.060]  Yeah, I found that I was, I was not as good at orienteering as I thought I was.
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:40.580]  No, me neither.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:44.740]  And Jonas, that was, that was, that was probably my, my, my most difficult part of the game
[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:47.380]  was just like, where the hell am I?
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:50.660]  I really needed like a, like a full-time compass or something.
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:53.300]  Like, like a parrot on my shoulder.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:54.660]  Tell me where to go.
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:59.860]  It should be like an in-app purchase.
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.780]  There were times, there were a handful of times, I don't know.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:06.580]  Cause I've only, I, I, it's not like I've sit there and replayed it and replayed it.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.140]  So I don't know.
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:11.060]  But there are times where your character, I think, I don't think this is, whether your
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:13.540]  character has a walkie talkie all the time and you can contact.
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:18.100]  And there were times where, where I, I called for help like, Hey, where am I?
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:19.940]  And I don't think that everybody got there.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:25.300]  I, I think I might've been particularly lost and that they were, there's like a, Hey,
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:31.380]  if you, you know, X amount of minutes have gone by where you were supposed to do Y and
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:36.900]  you're this far away, why don't you have them call and get a hint?
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:43.220]  I think I got some help from the game a couple of times because I was really lost.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:48.900]  And it was like, one time I came back and I was like, I was like, Ooh, I found another,
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.580]  I found another firewatch tower.
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:51.080]  Ooh.
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:53.700]  And then I realized it was fine.
[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:58.740]  I thought I was, I thought, and I, but I thought that I was like all the way at like the far
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:09:59.700]  North of the map.
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:02.900]  Like I was all the way North at the far edge of the map.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:04.580]  And it turns out I was right in the middle.
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:07.060]  And I was like, Oh, no wonder I'm not finding this.
[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:10.500]  Anyway, I cannot say enough good things about this game.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:14.900]  I found that for 20 bucks, it was extraordinarily fun to play.
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:17.620]  Um, just remarkable.
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:22.180]  And for those of you who don't know this game, it's from a game developer, uh, called Campo
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:27.060]  Santo and that they announced a few years ago, they partnered with our friends at, uh,
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:39.940]  panic who are a bunch of, um, weird, uh, uh, sort of militants who, who, uh, occupied a
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:47.780]  design studio in Portland and are in a long running standoff with the federal government.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:49.060]  That's who I was talking about.
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:51.380]  Panic, but they're really nice guys.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:53.940]  That's the difference between panic and some of these other people.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:58.420]  They are also against, um, the government, um, forcing Apple to unlock.
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:10:58.980]  Right there.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:04.660]  But they're really nice people at panic and they are just incredibly obsessive about good
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:11.380]  design and they've clearly met like their game making soulmates in Campo Santo because
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:18.100]  the game is so exquisitely detailed, just little things like, did you check out like
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:19.140]  the, some of the books?
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:21.700]  Yeah.
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:22.740]  And you can like turn them around.
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:24.660]  I mean, there's, there's so many little details like that.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:30.020]  I mean, I didn't, I need to go back and play it again because I skipped a lot of that stuff
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:33.140]  just to, because I was interested in advancing the story.
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:36.020]  So, um, and I think there's a whole other layer there.
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:40.740]  I mean, cause I, one of the things I did after playing the game was I watched a, um, a YouTube
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:50.020]  video by someone who, uh, you know, spends her time playing games and was going into
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:58.020]  great detail about like speculation about, um, things that were not explicitly said in
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:58.420]  the game.
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:01.300]  Um, and it was very interesting.
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:03.060]  I thought, I mean, I don't think that's true.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:03.620]  Like all of it.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:08.340]  I mean, I'm certain that all of it is not, what are the odds, all that, all that speculation
[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:10.980]  is not leading somewhere, but a lot of it is.
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.420]  What are the odds that you could find that YouTube video and I could put it in the show
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:14.420]  notes?
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:17.860]  Uh, uh, I will, I will make that happen one way or the other.
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:21.540]  Cause I would, A, like to watch that video and B, I would like to put it in the show
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:22.260]  notes.
[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:26.340]  Uh, I would implore everybody watching the, or listening to the show.
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:29.300]  Don't look at anything else about, if you really, if you're thinking maybe you want
[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:31.780]  to play it, just get this game, put it on your Mac, get it.
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:32.660]  You can get it from Steam.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.820]  Yeah, just play it, play it first and then you can watch all that.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:39.620]  You can get it from Steam for your Mac or your PC and you can get it for, uh, PS4 on
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:42.740]  the, uh, uh, the PlayStation store.
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:46.660]  Can't play it on Xbox or last, but, um, one way or the other, you can play it.
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:48.500]  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:54.740]  I really was blown away and I was skeptical just because I just don't play games and
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:57.620]  I thought, well, I'm going to buy it anyway, just so I can see what it, you know, cause
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:01.460]  I know the panic guys and I want to see it and I'm genuinely curious because the game
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:03.860]  sounds so unlike any game I've ever heard before.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:09.300]  Uh, I just found myself, I really like was compelled to finish this game really.
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:17.060]  And I really, really felt, you know, yeah, I was, I was in almost a, uh, not a state
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:21.460]  of frenzy, but like, it was one of those things like, like when I read the, like, when I read
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.740]  the Martian, when I read the book, the Martian, I mean, I read it and it's a, it's a, it's
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:25.540]  not a long book.
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:32.180]  I mean, it's not a terribly long game, but I was very goal oriented in trying to finish
[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:34.420]  it because I wanted to see what was going to happen.
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:37.540]  And there's, you know, moments when you're supposed to feel certain things, maybe you
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:38.820]  feel sad or whatever.
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:39.700]  And I really felt them.
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:44.340]  I really it's, it's, and again, it's just a testimony to the writing and it's such a
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.300]  great scenario.
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:49.700]  Some of the details, the details of the thing reminded me just a little, just a little bit,
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:52.420]  like sort of like the way, did you watch the show Lost?
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:54.260]  Oh yeah.
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:59.140]  Sort of like Lost, where there'd be like brands, brand names or something like that, or just
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:02.900]  the way, you know, something was set up and the way that there was like a mystery, some
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:05.780]  of the things in the mystery might've happened a few years ago.
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:10.260]  And it really reminded me of Lost in a, in a, in a very, very good way.
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:12.180]  Like, I mean, that is nothing but a compliment.
[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:15.540]  So anyway, go play this game.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.380]  But better, possibly better scripted.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:17.880]  Yes.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:20.900]  Overall, overall better scripted.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:24.500]  I mean, you know, I think there are certain episodes of Lost that bring me to tears.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:30.420]  However, they, I think, you know, if you looked at the arc over all the seasons, they kind
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:35.860]  of certainly more cohesive, like Lost, a version of Lost that was the length of Firewatch might've
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:36.740]  been the best thing ever.
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.020]  I wonder how good you could do.
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:47.860]  I wonder if you took all five or six seasons of Lost and you just edited it down, you know,
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:54.820]  to like maybe like 20 total episodes, took out all the dead ends, just edit it down to
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:55.700]  about 20 episodes.
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:57.220]  You might have one of the best shows ever made.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:01.140]  Anyway, I cannot wait to see what else these guys come up with.
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:05.220]  I know that games take a long time, so it'll be a while, but boy, they really hit it out
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:05.940]  of the park with this.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:07.700]  And I know that they've had some success.
[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:09.380]  I know that they're, they're doing pretty well.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:15.860]  I have 99% sure cable Sasser tweeted that they, they made their, made their, the investment
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:19.620]  to make the game back on day one, which is great.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.180]  I think that, you know, cause it's things take years to make.
[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:26.580]  So it's a big, big investment of time and any kind of big investment of time is obviously
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:27.780]  a big investment in money.
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:32.580]  So I'm happy to hear that, but I really hope that this game gets legs and sort of gets
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:36.020]  like a little word of mouth and just spreads because it really deserves to.
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:37.780]  Yeah.
[02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:41.540]  I know it thought of me and one thing I'd be so glad I thought of it.
[02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:47.060]  It really reminded me of there was in the latter years of his life, Roger Ebert was
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:50.260]  involved in some debates on whether video games could be art.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:54.980]  And he sided on the argument that, no, they're not art, not in a way that movies are.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:59.780]  And, you know, I think part of it is he was, you know, a little curmudgeonly he's, you
[02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:00.900]  know, and he's a little older.
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:07.140]  And, you know, and part of it is I think that it's, you know, like any good debater, he,
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.860]  you know, he's took a strong opinion because it makes for a good argument.
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:11.860]  He wasn't a jerk about it, in my opinion.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.300]  You know, I disagreed with him, even as someone who doesn't play games.
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:18.420]  But I thought it was interesting.
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:22.980]  This to me, I had this thought when I completed Firewatch that I wish Roger Ebert was still
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:29.860]  around because I would love, love to present Firewatch to him as the counter argument to
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:31.540]  can video game be art?
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:34.420]  Because this, if this is an art, then nothing is art.
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:39.060]  It makes you, if I, you know, what is art is obviously.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:42.020]  We should talk about that.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:48.020]  Talk about your last, your last year of college, you know, get find the kid from college, you
[02:16:48.020 --> 02:16:50.500]  picked up a British accent and we'll, we'll go.
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:52.180]  We're at two hours and 15 minutes.
[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:53.300]  Let's talk about what is art.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.900]  Boy, I would find it very difficult for anybody to come up with a definition of art that doesn't
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:00.100]  fit this game.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:07.860]  This game, or at least if your version of art, uh, would qua would, would include novels
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:14.260]  and would include, uh, feature films that, that in the way that if those things can be
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:19.700]  art, and I think most people would agree that they can be, then the game Firewatch is art.
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:20.980]  Yeah.
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:24.020]  Which in a, and, you know, getting back to my original comment, I mean, I think is that
[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:27.700]  that is why some people don't like it is because it is art.
[02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:33.780]  Yeah, I, I, and that is not, I mean, and their definition of gameplay is not right.
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:37.380]  It's a little bit more like sports, you know?
[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:38.260]  Yeah, perhaps.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:38.580]  Right.
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:43.540]  Although if you watch Stefan Curry, sports are becoming art.
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:49.620]  So obviously all of these things are, you know, there's blurred lines, uh, you know,
[02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:54.820]  there's blurred lines between all these things, but that, uh, you know, it's, it's to me,
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.820]  it's, I, I just can't say enough good things about it.
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:59.700]  And I, anybody who's listened to this show for a long time, I don't know that I've
[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:04.580]  ever talked about a game on this show ever, and this is episode 148.
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.580]  So it's, it's rare.
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:11.220]  And if this is a game, boy, you know, and I tried looking around, I asked in Syracuse,
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:16.820]  of course, who is a real gamer and really, you know, I think shockingly knows, you know,
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.260]  every video game that's ever been made.
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:20.260]  Uh, he had some suggestions.
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:21.860]  I was like, are there other games like this?
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.620]  Like, am I, am I missing out?
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.460]  Like, is there like an entire, like,
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:27.460]  Yeah, there definitely, I mean, there definitely are.
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:30.740]  Um, what, what's that home, uh, not home alone.
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:35.940]  There's a game, uh, where you basically come into a house and, and it's empty and
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.220]  you have to try and figure out what happened.
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:37.460]  Yeah.
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:38.420]  I don't know what that is.
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:40.820]  I think that might've been the one he was telling me to play, but
[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.740]  Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty good too.
[02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:46.340]  So it's, it's, you know, I don't know.
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:47.860]  Can't say enough good things about it.
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:48.980]  Anything else you want to talk about?
[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:51.700]  No, I just, I just want my phone, man.
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:55.380]  I just want my small phone.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:55.860]  John.
[02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:57.140]  I want my small phone back.
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:58.740]  John Moltz wants his small phone back.
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:09.700]  Everybody can get all the Moltz that they want at, uh, at, uh, your website,
[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:15.460]  which is very nice website, uh, dot comernet.
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.500]  I'm going to say dot net.
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:18.740]  You pick, you pick, take your pick.
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:22.580]  You've got to go to very nice website.net and, uh, you can get all the Moltz you
[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:23.460]  want there.
[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:26.740]  You got the Twitter feed, which is, uh, just at Moltz.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:32.580]  And, uh, your, your other big podcasts, the one, uh, it's turning this car
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:32.900]  around.
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:33.780]  Look at that.
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:35.620]  It's up to episode 99 already.
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:36.820]  Holy crap.
[02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:37.460]  We a hundred.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.340]  We just did a hundred.
[02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:43.780]  I think that just came out, uh, I was, I was looking at very nice website.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:46.260]  I know I got to get, I got to, so you got to turning this car around.
[02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:48.820]  That's with a big weekend.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:52.020]  That's the show you do with John Armstrong.
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:58.660]  And then you got the rebound with, uh, with Dan Morin, where you talk.
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:19:59.380]  Then that's one.
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:02.740]  Now turning this car around is the one you talk about parenting, uh, what it's
[02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:04.900]  like to have kids in the modern, you know, modern world.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:08.100]  Very funny stuff from really terrible parents.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:14.340]  You've been on the show and then talk about bad parents.
[02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:18.180]  And then, uh, I let my kid play firewatch before I even checked what was in the
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:18.420]  game.
[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:22.740]  Uh, and then there's the rebound where you talk about technology and it's, you
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:25.140]  know, you know, more like a ripoff of this show.
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:27.140]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:28.500]  And that's with the Dan Morin.
[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:36.020]  Oh, I'm going to hear about, you can get all of those.
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.820]  So you didn't have to, you just Google them and just type them into overcast or
[02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:39.060]  whatever.
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.740]  But if you just go to very nice website, uh, dot net, you'll find links to all of
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:43.460]  those shows.
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:44.900]  I'll put the links up eventually.
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:49.540]  Oh, thank you for your time, John.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:50.420]  I really appreciate it.
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:53.140]  As always, it's always a pleasure.
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:21:13.860]  All right, have a good week.
