[00:00.960 --> 00:08.400]  You ready for this? Yes. I have to. You do more podcasts than I do. You do a bunch,
[00:08.400 --> 00:13.440]  and so I feel like you've got better podcasts. Mine aren't as long though. I'm not sure if I
[00:13.440 --> 00:19.440]  do have mine add up in time to the amount that you... Right, I need to work up like a head of
[00:19.440 --> 00:25.760]  steam, but then once I get it going, it goes. But it's breaking that. Oh man, I don't know.
[00:25.760 --> 00:33.200]  I just got a lot going on here. Anyway, we got... It's an interesting week. I mean,
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.960]  there's a bunch of... It's a crazy week. You know, like a few weeks after WWDC and
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.440]  often I think this time is not necessarily a lot going on, but...
[00:44.400 --> 00:50.400]  I think part of it is just that there's stuff that's in the general tech news sphere that
[00:50.400 --> 00:56.240]  just happens to be erupting, like the whole Uber thing and Amazon buying Whole Foods,
[00:57.120 --> 01:01.360]  and that's just coincidental. But then part of it too is a bunch of the stuff we want to talk
[01:01.360 --> 01:08.240]  about is 10-year iPhone anniversary, which isn't coincidental. So it's not a surprise, but it is
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.440]  unusual where I feel like... And maybe I'm just misremembering, but it seems to me like after most
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.840]  WWDCs, the rest of the month, we just talk about what happened at WWDC, and I feel like we don't
[01:17.840 --> 01:25.680]  even have time today to go back to anything from WWDC. Right. Yeah. Rehash that. Have you seen the
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.880]  new iPad yet? I did. Yeah. Yeah. I managed to get over the store to take a look at it. I think...
[01:32.880 --> 01:39.840]  You mean the 10.5 inch? Yes, exactly. Yeah. With promotion. You know, in not having my 9.7 inch
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.840]  one with me, I didn't really notice the difference, frankly. No, not really. I think if I held them up
[01:45.840 --> 01:49.440]  together, I would notice the difference, but it seemed like, oh, this is the same... Like,
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.880]  I had to ask somebody. I was like, this is the 10.5? Yeah. It totally has that effect.
[01:56.560 --> 02:02.960]  But then Amy has a 9.7 here, and hers is white, which I think really accentuates the bezels.
[02:03.520 --> 02:10.720]  And all of a sudden, it's like it makes the 9.7 Pro, which is like the same dimensions as the
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.720]  iPad Air and later. It makes them feel like they're the old original iPods with the big
[02:16.720 --> 02:20.960]  inch thick bezels all along every side. Right? It's like, all of a sudden, it's like, why do
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.320]  they have these thick bezels all over the place? I'm a little worried about... I think sometimes,
[02:26.880 --> 02:34.240]  even with... I have an iPad Air 2, and even with that, I extraneous touch along the side of the
[02:34.960 --> 02:39.280]  bezel sometimes. And I'm a little concerned that that's going to just get worse. But
[02:39.280 --> 02:45.440]  I think, eventually, I think I'm going to get a 10.5 inch.
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.400]  Yeah. I think it's fantastic. Dan, did you notice the promotion scrolling?
[02:50.400 --> 02:57.600]  Yeah. Yeah, I did. It's really smooth. I mean, it just gets better and better.
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.480]  It's... But the whole reason I ask is because it really is the one thing that they announced
[03:02.480 --> 03:07.680]  that you have to see to believe. You know what I mean? I don't need to see the new MacBook. I
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.000]  get it. I've already... I know what those displays look like. I know what the keyboard is like.
[03:12.880 --> 03:17.520]  I can kind of imagine it. But the promotion, you really have to see.
[03:17.520 --> 03:23.200]  Yeah. So I'm actually looking forward to... Well, I mean, I think... So I'm kind of waiting
[03:23.200 --> 03:29.360]  just because I want to wait until iOS 11 comes out. And maybe sometime in November,
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.720]  I'll be like, that's what my birthday is too. Speaking of coincidences.
[03:34.720 --> 03:41.120]  Well, the other thing too is it seems like iPad development has slowed down a little bit. So if
[03:41.120 --> 03:47.200]  you plan to wait until iOS 11 comes out in October or whenever, I don't think you have any fear that
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.840]  you're not getting your money's worth out of it. Because even what's the soonest they could
[03:51.840 --> 03:59.040]  replace it would be next June at WWDC. So what? Yeah. And I just feel like with this jump to
[03:59.040 --> 04:04.800]  promotion, I really doubt that the next iPhone or iPad is going to have something that really makes
[04:04.800 --> 04:08.880]  you regret it. It feels like this is the... I already had my MacBook Pro obsoleted. So
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.800]  what difference does it make? And the other thing I've saw, and it's pretty interesting,
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.440]  because I don't have this complaint, even though I'm a nitpicky person and I notice details. But
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.280]  ever since iOS 7 come out, there's a faction of people who feel like the animations in the OS
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.920]  have gotten too slow and stuttery. Like it takes too long or that... Especially like there's people
[04:31.920 --> 04:35.040]  who complain about the frame rate of the animations, like when you hit the home button
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.880]  and the app zooms out and stuff. And I think I see what they mean, but it somehow doesn't bother me.
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.640]  I would say that I notice it a little bit, but I'm running an iPhone SE.
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.760]  And I don't think I noticed it on my iPad here too. Yeah, but I don't know about that. I feel
[04:51.760 --> 04:58.800]  like the SE is such an overpowered GPU for the tiny little screen that I almost feel like if
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.200]  you see it on the SE, it's proof that it's a real thing. Yeah, it could be. Like the SE is not a...
[05:05.280 --> 05:11.440]  It's not a weak iPhone. Like if you were still running the 5S, then yes, then there's a reason
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.160]  for it. But I kind of feel like the fact that if you kind of notice it on the SE, that's the proof
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.280]  of it. I feel like ProMotion puts that to rest. And they're probably similar. Like my iPhone SE
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.360]  and my iPad Air 2 and my SE, I don't know off the top of my head, but they're probably similar
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.240]  processors, if not the same, right? Yeah, I think so.
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.800]  So I don't know why. I mean, I don't use my iPad Air 2 as much. I mean, maybe that's why.
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.240]  So anyway, I feel like that's the answer to anybody who has complaints about the frame rate of stuff.
[05:41.920 --> 05:45.920]  Just get a 10.5 inch iPad. Get a new iPad.
[05:45.920 --> 05:53.200]  Yeah. Oh, follow up. I have a bit of follow up from my show last week with Serenity Caldwell,
[05:53.200 --> 05:58.800]  where, surprise, surprise, I got off on a tangent. We were talking about pencils.
[05:59.520 --> 06:03.600]  And I was talking about my favorite pencil from high school, the Dixon Ticonderoga.
[06:04.560 --> 06:10.400]  And how they've gone downhill, because back then they were made in America from American timber
[06:10.400 --> 06:15.360]  and graphite and an old American factory with American standards. And now they're cheap pieces
[06:15.360 --> 06:22.080]  of crap made in China. I just cannot even believe that they, I can't believe they put the name on
[06:22.080 --> 06:28.080]  them. Anyway, I got a nice note from a guy named Michael Hagen, who writes a blog called Leadfast,
[06:29.360 --> 06:34.480]  L-E-A-D-F-A-S-T.org. And it's an entire blog devoted to pencils.
[06:35.040 --> 06:36.080]  Wow. And notebooks.
[06:37.280 --> 06:43.040]  And it's really nice. I want to put a link to the show notes, because he was, you know,
[06:43.040 --> 06:46.560]  as you might imagine, somebody who writes an entire blog devoted to pencils, he's got very
[06:46.560 --> 06:53.200]  strong opinions, noted that I was exactly correct that the Chinese made Dixon Ticonderogas were made
[06:53.200 --> 06:59.200]  from substandard wood and substandard lead and even had sloppy paint jobs on the, oh my God,
[06:59.200 --> 07:04.000]  I just learned the name from it, of it on his blog, the metal thing that connects the wood
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.360]  to the eraser. It's called like a ferrule or something like that. They even got sloppy on
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.000]  the paint job on that. And that's like Dixon Ticonderogas brand, like the green ferrule with
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.280]  the yellow stripe around the middle. Like when you think of iconic pencil, like if you just think,
[07:19.280 --> 07:23.760]  go to Getty images and look at a pencil, you're looking, what you have in your mind is a Dixon
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.560]  Ticonderoga. Anyway, the good news is, is even though they're still made in China, there's
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.600]  actually some recent ones that they've gone back to American cedar and, and the quality has
[07:33.600 --> 07:39.440]  actually actually gone up. No. So how many pencils, how many pencils do you use on a regular basis?
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.200]  I don't use pencils anymore. I haven't used a pencil in 20 years. Because they're so crappy
[07:45.200 --> 07:51.360]  or just be? No, because I've switched to pens and I don't, I very seldom have a need to erase
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.400]  anything. I don't make mistakes. Does Jonas have like a hundred of them lying around for school?
[07:56.400 --> 08:01.200]  He loses pencils left and right. He never has a pencil. I don't understand how that can be.
[08:01.200 --> 08:09.040]  I, we buy a lot of pencils and, uh, uh, and he's never got them and it always looks, he's, he's
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.960]  got like a pencil that's half the size it should be and has no eraser. Uh, and that's what Hank has.
[08:14.960 --> 08:23.200]  And we, we have to address this issue. We have a box of those big arrow head erasers that, you
[08:23.200 --> 08:27.920]  know, the, the extra eraser you pop on and they're right in my office. Every, you know, there's not
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.000]  hidden, everybody knows where they are. So there's no reason not to have an eraser. And then he'll
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.480]  sit there and do his homework and, and like not be able to erase stuff. It's very frustrating.
[08:38.480 --> 08:46.160]  Don't get me started. A years ago I got a box of black feet, Indian pencils. Oh man. Those,
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.080]  which I think was a rerun of them or something like that. Um, I think it was like all the way
[08:50.080 --> 08:53.920]  back in the nineties and I've just been working through those. I mean, the racers are like rock
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.120]  hard now. So the racers are basically useless. Um, but the pens feel nice. They're pencils. They
[08:59.120 --> 09:05.120]  feel really good. So I still, I still have like eight of them in there. I have a box of Dixon
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.480]  Ticonderogas from the nineties, uh, that I'm sure the good ones, but I feel like I made the same
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.160]  critical mistake, uh, that you just mentioned, which is that I thought I could save these for
[09:14.160 --> 09:19.040]  the rest of my life and always have good pencils. But now the erasers are like, when you're younger,
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.200]  you didn't know, you might not have known that that happens, but I could still use them and put
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.240]  those, the, the that's right. You've got to, you know, where those are, it was sort of like the
[09:28.240 --> 09:37.040]  original, uh, like, uh, iPhone case peripherals, the upsell. Yep. The other thing, uh, have you
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.160]  noticed that, I mean, everybody, I think with kids knows this now, but it's like part of the great
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.160]  series. I mean, it's an all sincerity, the decline of American society. I really mean
[09:46.160 --> 09:53.120]  it. Part of it is, is that schools are now short of supplies. Again, kids, you have to come to
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.920]  school with your own pencils and paper and stuff like that. Like when I, when, when I was a kid,
[09:57.920 --> 10:03.200]  I went to public public school, there was an endless supply of paper and pencils. I mean,
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.960]  I guess pencils, they kind of metered out, but they, you didn't have to bring your own, you know,
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.840]  that, that, that you'd be given a pencil. Yeah. But they didn't have to buy computers.
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.920]  No, I mean, maybe they had much more, a lot more money to spend on pencils because they weren't
[10:17.920 --> 10:24.320]  spending like 500 bucks on a computer for each kid. And you hear about these teachers, you know,
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.440]  who out of their own salary, buy paper and, and scissors and stuff like that. It's nuts. How's
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.080]  that possible? It's absolutely horrendous. So I gave a whole bunch, I gave a bunch of money
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.600]  earlier this year to like, there's a, there's a site where you can donate to teachers projects.
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.160]  I would do that. That's a good class. Yeah. I don't know. I'll see if I can find it and
[10:44.160 --> 10:48.480]  send it to you. But yeah, it's just that you read through the thing and you're thinking like,
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.080]  why does it have to be done? Like it's the same thing with like the kickstarters for people's
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.560]  healthcare. Yeah, exactly. Why this should not be a thing. This is not the way, this is not the way
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.360]  a world-class country should operate. Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. I'll get this
[11:01.360 --> 11:05.120]  show going. Really. We got to keep, we got to get, keep me, keep me going, John. You got to keep me,
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.560]  okay. Keep me moving. I want to tell you about mail route. Mail route has been supporting this
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.120]  show for a while. Here's what they do. They handle email. That's all they do. They're email
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.440]  specialists. So who do you want in charge of your email? Do you want like somebody who does
[11:19.440 --> 11:25.840]  some company that does everything from hosting websites to electrical wiring? No, you want
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.200]  somebody who specializes only in email. The team at mail route has been devoted to email for about
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.000]  20 years. A lot of them have been there the whole time. And a lot of other companies are getting out
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.640]  of the email protection business right now because it's just such a mess. Postini went away. McAfee
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.680]  and MX logic, they went away and Google has even come out. Google has come out and said that even
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.560]  if you use like Google apps mail for your business, that they recommend you get a company like mail
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.720]  route to filter the email before it gets into the spam. Here's what they do. They don't host
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.440]  your email for you. They just run a filtering service, you change the MX records for your
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.920]  domain name. That's just the DNA, the part of the having a domain name that says here's where email
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.720]  goes to so and so at your domain.com. What server handles that incoming email, you point that to
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.440]  mail route, mail route, the email goes in first, and it's just like a screen. And then they
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.480]  immediately, you know, like probably like a millisecond, forwarded on to your regular mail
[12:22.480 --> 12:28.480]  server. So you don't have to install any software. You don't have to run anything on a server. You
[12:28.480 --> 12:33.440]  don't have to change your mail server at all. You just change the MX record to have it go through
[12:33.440 --> 12:39.600]  mail route first, and that's it. And then all of a sudden, your spam is gone. No more junk. It is
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.520]  amazing. It is super accurate. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's almost magical how accurate
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.360]  it is and how few mistakes they make. And they've got all sorts of other power user features. If
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.040]  you're a professional admin and you're charged this at your business where they have APIs where
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.800]  you can hook up and do anything you might imagine. It's all the details, everything you'd want to do
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.960]  from a company that literally just specializes in protecting email from spam and viruses. So where
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.520]  do you go to find out more? Well, first you'll get a 30-day free trial if you go to this URL,
[13:09.520 --> 13:19.920]  mailroute.net slash TTS, mailroute.net slash TTS. And I'll steal the line from Marco Arment. This

[13:37.120 --> 13:44.080]  for their continuing support of the talk show. Okay. So some follow up from earlier in, in this
[13:44.080 --> 13:55.520]  episode. Okay. Um, the, uh, the se has an a nine chip and the air two has an eight X. So it's
[13:55.520 --> 14:06.400]  probably me. Yeah. Uh, uh, what else can we talk about? Yeah. You want to wait into one of the,
[14:06.400 --> 14:13.360]  uh, one of the big ones? Well, let's do the big one. I think the biggest one and the one that is,
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.800]  has the most, uh, historical value, no, no pun intended. It was John Markoff hosting,
[14:19.760 --> 14:25.440]  um, a discussion at the computer history museum out in mountain view, California, where he had,
[14:25.440 --> 14:32.560]  uh, first discussion with three guys from the original iPhone team, Hugo finds, I'm not quite
[14:32.560 --> 14:40.800]  sure how to pronounce his surname, uh, Nitin Ganatra, uh, and Scott Hurst, uh, Nitin. I know
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.800]  him, I've met him. He's, he's a very nice guy. And he's, he's been on, uh, the debug podcast with,
[14:46.800 --> 14:55.520]  uh, yeah, guy English and, uh, Renee Richie with Don Melton, who was, uh, who's a great guy. He's,
[14:55.520 --> 15:02.640]  uh, uh, was a big shot on the safari team, uh, and is now, you know, out of Apple and, and has no
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.160]  fucks left to give. Um, that's true. You can see it with those guys on stage. You know what I mean?
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.960]  Like, and they're, you know, good Apple people remain Apple people and they're not telling,
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.200]  there's no stories that they told that I would consider like out of turn. They're certainly not
[15:17.200 --> 15:24.000]  spilling secrets, but there's like a relaxedness to them that active Apple employees, especially
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.200]  the ones with the most, most responsibilities just don't have. Yeah. The funny, the funny one was,
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.920]  I think it was, I think it was Hertz said it's like someone was bugging him for, for something
[15:33.920 --> 15:37.280]  like, when's this, when are we going to get this? When are we going to get this? When is Steve
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.400]  going to get this? And he said, he'll get it when it's fucking ready. And Steve like sticks his head
[15:42.400 --> 15:49.600]  around the corner. Okay. There were so many good stories that those guys had. Uh, that was a great
[15:49.600 --> 15:57.120]  one. I kind of feel like number one, you could feel the flop sweat of that moment. Right. But
[15:57.120 --> 16:01.680]  I also feel like Steve jobs was the sort of guy who, who wasn't petty enough to take, you know,
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.360]  like he would see humor in that. Yeah, I would think so completely. I mean, I think a lot of
[16:05.360 --> 16:10.240]  people think that that person would get fired immediately, but that's not, that's not like he,
[16:10.240 --> 16:14.400]  like maybe George Steinbrenner would do that. Right. That's the difference between Steve jobs
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.920]  is tyranny and, and Steinbrenner is like, jobs is, was mostly rational. And as long as you're
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.920]  still getting the work done, you know, and, you know, if he, if he didn't get the thing in like
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.960]  the next 20 minutes, then he would have gotten fired. Yeah. Uh, and then afterwards, after those
[16:28.960 --> 16:35.840]  three fellows, uh, spoke with Mark off, um, uh, Scott forced all was up for about an hour by
[16:35.840 --> 16:41.920]  himself. Uh, so combination, it was, I loved it. I re it was really, it was, if you haven't watched
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.240]  this thing the whole two hours, I swear I've got this link. I'll put it in the show notes. I'll
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.800]  bet most of you who are listening to me right now have, have watched it because it seems like
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.160]  if, if you weren't anxious to watch that, I don't know why you listened to my show. Like,
[16:56.160 --> 17:02.240]  I can't imagine the what's outside the Venn diagram of people who listen to the talk show
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.120]  and people who might want to watch Scott for stalls first public appearance since he was
[17:07.120 --> 17:10.640]  ousted from the company five years ago. And if you can get the audio, you can just, I mean,
[17:10.640 --> 17:13.920]  the audio is fine. You don't have to watch it. I mean, like some people don't have time to sit
[17:13.920 --> 17:18.080]  down and necessarily watch it two hour. That is absolutely correct. You could treat it as
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.160]  a podcast and it would work just fine. Uh, for example, I will, I will along the same lines,
[17:24.160 --> 17:31.760]  uh, there's tens of thousands of people who listen to the audio version of, uh, my live show as
[17:31.760 --> 17:36.640]  opposed to watching the video. Uh, I guess I don't know how many people listen because I just get
[17:36.640 --> 17:41.600]  download numbers and maybe, maybe that's inflated because people watch the video and then their
[17:41.600 --> 17:46.960]  podcast player downloaded it. And so I don't know, I, but I suspect that there are tens of
[17:46.960 --> 17:52.320]  thousands of people who still listen to the audio version. Um, I gotta, I gotta watch for Craig's
[17:52.320 --> 17:59.520]  hair. It's, it's even better because he did that thing where he ran and it's a hair blowing in the
[17:59.520 --> 18:06.720]  wind. Uh, and it just always goes right back into place. It's, it's very strange. Like he, it, that's
[18:06.720 --> 18:11.920]  the thing, you know, everybody makes jokes about it. You know, it's the, the hair force one or
[18:11.920 --> 18:15.920]  whatever is his username is and in the demos and stuff like that. But the thing that's most
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.480]  amazing about it isn't that he has nice looking hair, uh, which he does, but it's that it's
[18:20.480 --> 18:27.360]  seemingly, uh, it, it, it combs itself somehow self-sustaining. Yeah. Like it styles itself and
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.600]  like he, he can get nervous and like run his fingers through it and you think, oh man,
[18:31.600 --> 18:35.120]  you're messing up your hair. And, and then he lets go and it just goes right back,
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.640]  right back into place. It's like, oh, when Homer Simpson shaves his beard and the,
[18:38.640 --> 18:45.040]  the stubble pops right back out. Anyway, this was fantastic. I don't even know where to start.
[18:45.040 --> 18:50.480]  Uh, except that I will say briefly I, and somebody asked me, I guess this is why I have a podcast is
[18:50.480 --> 18:55.040]  like, it's easier for me to talk about this, shoot the shit with you than to write an article about
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.560]  it. Like I don't, you know, a couple of people are like, Hey, you're going to write a big article
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.840]  about forestalls appearance. And I don't have, I, there's nothing in my mind that needs to be said.
[19:03.840 --> 19:08.720]  Like I feel like the interview speaks for itself and I just have like meta commentary about it.
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.920]  Right. We can, we can retell the stories that they told. Uh, yeah, we should just steal all
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.920]  the stories. Uh, my favorite, the only thing that I thought was sorta weird was, um, you know,
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.280]  you talked about telling stories out of turn, um, was that forestall kind of made Steve sound like
[19:23.280 --> 19:28.720]  an idiot over the rocker. Like he just, like, he just like heard the name and thought, Oh,
[19:28.720 --> 19:32.880]  the rocker, it must be like the same as the razor. So it's going to be a nice little phone and we
[19:32.880 --> 19:38.400]  should get on, you know, get our music on it. I think that that's kind of telling though. And
[19:38.400 --> 19:42.880]  I think it's exactly what happened, you know, maybe true. Right. Cause there was a bit too.
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.720]  I mean, we'll get to it, but there's also along these same lines of the 10 year anniversary of
[19:46.720 --> 19:52.080]  the iPhone is the, the, uh, the book that came out, uh, this week. I ha I have a copy of the
[19:52.080 --> 19:57.200]  book. I'm taking it with me on a, on a vacation starting soon. And I plan to read it. I look
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.840]  forward to it, but, uh, what's it called the one device by, uh, Brian merchant. But there was a
[20:01.840 --> 20:07.440]  long excerpt that ran in the verge that had some bits about the rocker, uh, from people who were
[20:07.440 --> 20:13.280]  on the team. And it sounds like that's, you know, I I've said it ever since the thing came out.
[20:13.280 --> 20:20.080]  I remember, you know, the very day that it was announced on stage, I re I pretty sure I blogged
[20:20.080 --> 20:24.240]  on during fireball. Like it looked to me like jobs wanted to throw the thing across the stage,
[20:24.240 --> 20:28.320]  like, cause like the demo didn't even work. It was like, it was supposed to ring or something.
[20:28.320 --> 20:31.680]  You're supposed to get a phone call, you know, get a phone call while you're playing music and
[20:31.680 --> 20:35.760]  show how it doesn't interrupt you or whatever. And it was, it didn't work. And I really thought
[20:35.760 --> 20:41.120]  he thought about just saying, you know what, screw it. We're not doing this. Uh, but then in the book
[20:41.120 --> 20:46.480]  they said, they even said that, that jobs is obvious. Uh, disdain for the product on stage
[20:46.480 --> 20:52.320]  angered the people from singular, uh, or maybe Motorola, Motorola. Yeah. Yeah. The singular
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.400]  people were like, Hey, we need, cause it is funny though. Like you can look at it and laugh,
[20:56.400 --> 21:02.560]  but they, you know, the other thing that came out of it was that, um, that rocker deal shepherded
[21:02.560 --> 21:07.440]  by Motorola, you know, with Motorola who had all this experience dealing with carriers,
[21:08.800 --> 21:14.160]  shepherded Steve jobs and whoever else, probably Eddie Q, you know, it was, it was always like
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.920]  a negotiating partner with jobs, uh, shepherd them through meeting, you know, the executives
[21:19.920 --> 21:25.040]  from the carriers and stuff like that. And it was, you know, jobs was, I, you know, it sounds
[21:25.040 --> 21:31.760]  like he was already thinking, uh, you know, we're going to do a phone, you know, I'll just use this
[21:31.760 --> 21:38.080]  as a moment to steal their expertise and relationships. So this probably would have,
[21:38.080 --> 21:45.360]  when, when do you think that that project started? Because it came out like this
[21:46.240 --> 21:53.440]  announced sometime in the summer of 2005. Yeah. So I, I do, I don't know if the one device has
[21:53.440 --> 21:59.280]  a timeline. I would like to see a timeline laid out all of this stuff. It looks like they, cause
[21:59.280 --> 22:05.200]  those, those three guys were talking, we're mostly talking about, um, 2005 when they started and
[22:05.200 --> 22:08.960]  things that already happened before that. So I would guess the rocker thing happened in like
[22:08.960 --> 22:12.640]  2004 or something. Yeah. They started, maybe started talking to him in 2004 or something
[22:12.640 --> 22:16.880]  like that. So they were probably, they probably were doing both at the same time. Yeah. Uh,
[22:16.880 --> 22:22.000]  which is funny because the iPod still had a couple of years left in it, but it just shows how
[22:22.880 --> 22:29.360]  Apple was already simultaneously keep, keep making the iPod better and better and its best sales
[22:29.360 --> 22:35.360]  years were still ahead of it, but already already had the proper paranoia thinking like if cell
[22:35.360 --> 22:40.160]  phones got good enough, they would, they would eat the iPod and they were cracked.
[22:42.400 --> 22:51.200]  Uh, I, as an aside, I just wanted to say in terms of, well, I'm not really an aside, but
[22:51.200 --> 22:57.440]  I feel like, uh, forestall really touched on this in, in his talk with Markoff where Markoff
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.080]  asked him if he was worried, you know, did he know it was going to be as big a deal as it,
[23:02.080 --> 23:06.480]  as it would be? And I think forestall more or less said, yeah, I knew it because I could just
[23:06.480 --> 23:12.720]  see how good it was. I knew that this was, this was it. Uh, and that all the other little issues
[23:12.720 --> 23:18.640]  like pricing and carrier support would work itself out over time, but that this was so clearly the
[23:18.640 --> 23:24.960]  future of computing and it was so good. And he brought up this great analogy or, or criticism
[23:24.960 --> 23:30.320]  where like reviewers would come out and say like, uh, and I remember this, I remember this being
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.360]  like a thing, like not just like one, one publicized review, but it was like the way
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.640]  people reviewed phones back then was like, well, wait a minute, this is pretty. And it is,
[23:40.640 --> 23:47.680]  you know, there's obviously, you know, I'll insert your 2000 circa 2007, uh, apples,
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.080]  apple cares about design, but nobody else does, you know, and look what it's got them in the PC
[23:52.080 --> 23:57.840]  market snark here. Um, but they would say like, look, I open up my Blackberry and I can go from
[23:57.840 --> 24:04.880]  off to sending an email in three taps. And on the iPhone, it's seven taps in a scroll.
[24:04.880 --> 24:10.080]  You know, this is way inefficient. This is, you know, this isn't a good UI and it's, you know,
[24:10.080 --> 24:14.400]  here's how many taps it takes to play a song and stuff like that. And forestall was like, that's,
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.880]  you know, that's the most idiotic way to look at this ever. Like the reason it was a great design
[24:18.880 --> 24:24.400]  is people could actually understand it. And he's so true, right? Like the left to right navigation
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.960]  and the way that they animated and that screens didn't, you didn't tap a thing and something just
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.000]  popped on the screen. It, it moved onto the screen and gave you a sense of spatiality.
[24:34.640 --> 24:42.240]  Is that a word? It is now I should ask Sir Kusa spatialness. Uh, I don't think spatiality is a
[24:42.240 --> 24:50.640]  word. Well, it is now. It wasn't MDS until just now. Somebody quick, put it on Wiktionary. Oh,
[24:50.640 --> 24:57.200]  wait. Spatiality. Is it really? It is relating to space. Spatiality. Okay. So it's, it's listed
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.280]  under the definition for spatial. Yeah. Did I pronounce it right? It's a noun. It's, it is a
[25:01.280 --> 25:07.760]  noun. Spatiality. Yeah. It sounds like you're mispronouncing special, special specialty.
[25:07.760 --> 25:16.240]  Uh, the thing that, no, I had to, uh, for reasons it is, it, this is,
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.520]  did I say I have to, we have to do this show quickly.
[25:21.600 --> 25:24.160]  You implied it. I didn't know for sure. We had a package
[25:24.800 --> 25:31.520]  delivered, uh, and we moved recently and the package, and I'm not going to say who ordered it,
[25:31.520 --> 25:39.360]  except that it wasn't me and Jonas doesn't order anything. Uh, it was sent to our old house instead
[25:39.360 --> 25:49.520]  of the new house. And, um, and it, it needed to ideally would have been in our hands before we,
[25:49.520 --> 25:58.080]  this coming weekend. And so, um, I, I, I still, you know, we rented the old house and, and the
[25:58.080 --> 26:03.360]  landlord had the package, one of one of two shipments, it was broken up into two shipments
[26:03.360 --> 26:07.840]  and the one, the one shipment had one item in it and the other one had like 10. Well, guess which
[26:07.840 --> 26:14.080]  one was already there. It was the one with one, but I did pick that up. And the UPS guy had left
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.960]  a sticker on the door that said, you know, here, you know, try June, sorry, you know, we'll come
[26:18.960 --> 26:25.120]  back tomorrow. And so using the tracking number on that, uh, instead of having it go to the old
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.320]  address again, the next day, you can't change it to a new address though. I think it's like a
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.440]  security thing where you have to send it to the Depot or you can send it to a pickup place. Yeah.
[26:35.440 --> 26:44.080]  Um, and that way they can check your ID. It makes total sense. Um, so I did that and I had a whole
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.800]  bunch of choices to choose from that are nearby our house, but a lot of them are just like little,
[26:48.800 --> 26:53.680]  like, I don't know, like cell phone stores. And, you know, it's surprising which businesses are
[26:53.680 --> 27:01.440]  UPS access points. That's what they call them. So I chose the UPS store because you would think,
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.680]  well, that's one that's going to be reliable, right? And it's a couple of blocks further away.
[27:05.680 --> 27:09.200]  It's actually what it's actually, it wasn't, it's not that close to our house at all actually.
[27:09.840 --> 27:16.160]  Um, but it's located in the ground floor of a big skyscraper, like one of the biggest skyscrapers
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.080]  in center city, Philadelphia, a magnificent building. Uh, so I go in there and of course
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.640]  the package isn't there, even though the UPS app says it was delivered and they even told
[27:26.640 --> 27:32.800]  me the name of the employee at the UPS store, uh, who signed for it. It's not there. There's,
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.640]  it's not there. They agree. It's not there. Um, and so I ended up, I had to call you'd think that
[27:38.640 --> 27:42.320]  maybe I could just deal with somebody there, but it turns out a UPS store isn't really UPS.
[27:44.400 --> 27:48.320]  So are they, yeah, they still like, cause they used to be mailboxes, et cetera, right?
[27:48.320 --> 27:54.720]  Yeah. And apparently that's sort of how it, that's exactly how it might as well just be right. Yeah.
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.640]  I had to call you the actual UPS and deal with them and I will say that they dealt with it fine
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.840]  and they called the retailer that we bought this stuff from to tell them, you know, this guy
[28:05.840 --> 28:10.480]  definitely is not scamming. You know, this package was somehow lost. We got a full refund, blah, blah,
[28:10.480 --> 28:17.280]  blah. But anyway, long story short, I'm on my phone on hold in the lobby of this skyscraper
[28:17.280 --> 28:25.520]  at five 30 in the afternoon yesterday. Um, and this building also, uh, has, uh,
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.280]  an entrance, an escalator that goes down to the commuter train station, which is about a block
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.760]  away. So it's a lot of people leaving work from this building who obviously worked there and a lot
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.360]  of other people who are nearby buildings are streaming through the lobby to get to the
[28:39.360 --> 28:45.120]  escalator to go down. So while I was on hold for a very long time, I just, people watched and it
[28:45.120 --> 28:51.600]  just, I just watched how many people are actually using their phone and is it an, is it, can I tell
[28:51.600 --> 28:57.040]  if it's an iPhone or not? And it's absolutely staggering if you just watch people. I watched,
[28:57.040 --> 29:02.000]  I was on hold for like half an hour and I didn't have a clicker, so I can't mathematically say it,
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  but I would estimate that over half of half of the people were on their phone, either looking at it
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.320]  and like texting or at the very least had headphones, which I could, I knew were connected
[29:12.320 --> 29:18.960]  to a phone and we're listening to something. And most of the people who weren't were in
[29:18.960 --> 29:24.160]  conversation with a colleague or friend or something. Almost every single person who was
[29:24.160 --> 29:30.960]  just solo, either leaving the building or going to the train station was on their phone. It's
[29:30.960 --> 29:34.640]  absolutely, you know, just to commemorate this 10 year anniversary of the iPhone,
[29:35.200 --> 29:39.440]  it, it, if you just sit there and think about it, it really looks like something out of science
[29:39.440 --> 29:46.400]  fiction from 2006. Yeah, I, there's a, I mean, I've seen that happen. I mean, I, the thing that
[29:46.400 --> 29:52.000]  I watch is people in cars, which drives me absolutely berserk. I mean, I, I, when I'm
[29:52.000 --> 29:57.440]  sitting at a stoplight and I watch the people who are driving by on the, you know, the perpendicular
[29:57.440 --> 30:02.400]  street, I watch and see how many of them are looking at their phones and it's an insane
[30:02.400 --> 30:08.000]  amount of people that drives me nuts. It drives me absolutely berserk. And I really do try to be
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.720]  religious about it while I'm driving. And I make jokes on the show about, about being a terrible
[30:12.720 --> 30:17.360]  driver and driving too fast. And I do like to drive fast, but no jokes aside, I really,
[30:17.360 --> 30:21.280]  really, really do not use the phone, especially in the city. Yeah. I don't even like using my watch
[30:21.280 --> 30:27.840]  that much. I mean, like I'll, I'll often like talk to Siri on the watch, but I, I mean, I'm not like,
[30:27.840 --> 30:32.320]  I don't even like looking at my text message or anything like that. Cause that's just, I'm not
[30:32.320 --> 30:37.920]  watching the fricking road. No, I don't know. I don't understand. I I'm, I'm terrified of cars.
[30:37.920 --> 30:43.280]  I really am. I, I, it's probably, you know, I don't have a phobia cause I ride in them,
[30:43.280 --> 30:49.920]  you know, but I feel like I'm on the spectrum of, of maybe being afraid to get in a car.
[30:49.920 --> 30:53.760]  But the problem is, isn't even so much that I don't want to get in a car. It's that I'm afraid
[30:53.760 --> 30:58.800]  of another car getting me, you know, and that can happen as a pedestrian in the city. But anyway,
[30:58.800 --> 31:04.320]  yeah, I, yeah. The other thing I was gonna say is like, I, that effect, I think it had already
[31:04.320 --> 31:08.160]  hit people who had Blackberries before the iPhone came out. Yeah. And a lot of those people, I mean,
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.360]  most of those people were like doing were business people doing business, texting or, you know,
[31:13.360 --> 31:16.560]  or whatever, whoever they were texting, you know, like maybe they're just joking around with like
[31:16.560 --> 31:19.920]  their work friends or something like that. They were texting back and forth constantly.
[31:19.920 --> 31:25.280]  Yeah. I remember when I, cause I used to work in an office, I remember going into the men's room
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.360]  and there was a guy there with his Blackberry in his hand, standing at the urinal,
[31:29.360 --> 31:32.320]  two handed typing on the Blackberry. Oh man.
[31:35.360 --> 31:40.960]  Yeah. Right. Maybe, you know, and especially in the, the, you know, sort of white collar
[31:40.960 --> 31:46.080]  office building where I was, there might've been that effect even before the iPhone, but yeah,
[31:46.080 --> 31:49.840]  maybe. So it's not, you know, and I bet a lot of, probably not to this degree that it is now,
[31:49.840 --> 31:55.360]  and I'll bet a lot of the headphone wearers would have had iPods, you know? So, you know,
[31:55.360 --> 31:59.600]  the larger trend is computing devices, little pocket size computing devices in general,
[31:59.600 --> 32:05.280]  but as of 2017, they're all phones. Yeah. It's, you know, and they're all, you know,
[32:05.280 --> 32:11.280]  roughly similar phones. So like they, they're all like rectangles with glass spaces that
[32:12.320 --> 32:15.920]  have an interface that takes up the whole thing. Right. And I felt like four stalls
[32:15.920 --> 32:20.640]  interview in particular really sort of captured that, you know, the other guys too, but they were
[32:20.640 --> 32:24.720]  a little, they were asked details that are questions that were a little bit more specific
[32:24.720 --> 32:29.280]  to anecdotes and four stalls was more bigger picture, but yeah. And it does. One of the,
[32:29.280 --> 32:32.880]  one of the things that he said that stuck out to me was that it never felt like work to use the
[32:32.880 --> 32:39.120]  iPhone. Cause he was talking about how, you know, he would just, I mean like, and, and I, you know,
[32:39.120 --> 32:42.960]  felt that when I, when I got it, I mean, I think that I always think back and think that was,
[32:42.960 --> 32:46.640]  this is like the one thing, like if I could go back in time and show like 13 year old me,
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.560]  something from the future, like an iPhone would be probably my first with that, without a question,
[32:52.560 --> 32:59.280]  my first choice. Yeah. I I've used the analogy of feeling like you're going uphill versus downhill
[33:00.080 --> 33:06.560]  and, you know, and, and it's, I, I like the metaphor, but it's, it's hard because
[33:06.560 --> 33:12.480]  like uphill is bad and downhill is good in my metaphor, but also saying some, but something's
[33:12.480 --> 33:16.880]  going downhill generally has a bad connotation. But what I just mean is it feel like you're
[33:16.880 --> 33:21.840]  fighting gravity or is gravity helping you? Like when you're riding a bike and it's just a gentle
[33:21.840 --> 33:26.320]  downhill, you know, like a five degree downhill thing, it feels like the easiest thing in the
[33:26.320 --> 33:30.480]  world and riding your bike up a Hill can somehow feel like, why do I own a bicycle?
[33:31.360 --> 33:34.240]  Someday I'll tell you the story about my brother's tried to teach me to ride a bike.
[33:34.240 --> 33:37.360]  It's actually, it's pretty quick. They pushed me down the Hills.
[33:41.360 --> 33:44.640]  So still, still not appropriate to certain audiences.
[33:46.640 --> 33:50.880]  And that's exactly what forestall was getting at. And I, you know, maybe feels like work is
[33:50.880 --> 33:54.640]  actually a better way to put it, you know, that it just felt like checking your email didn't feel
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.560]  like you're doing a thing. There's a few things that still feel like work to me on an iPhone. Like
[33:58.560 --> 34:05.920]  if I have to, um, change something on the server at daring fireball, like, and that happens almost,
[34:05.920 --> 34:11.200]  I mean, number one, my site doesn't change very often. So it's, that's pretty rare. But if,
[34:11.200 --> 34:17.440]  just to say, there's like a textbook, like, uh, to edit the schedule for sponsorships is I don't
[34:17.440 --> 34:22.080]  have like a CMS for that. It's a text file on the server. And if I have like a typo in it or
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.160]  something like that, and I'm on the phone, that feels like work. And I'm like, okay,
[34:26.160 --> 34:31.600]  and I'm on the phone that feels like work. Cause it's like, and I use the same app. I use, you
[34:31.600 --> 34:38.560]  know, uh, you know, the apps from, uh, panic. Uh, I guess, I guess on the phone I would use Coda
[34:38.560 --> 34:43.760]  and I'd open up the server and tap, tap into the folders and open it up. And it just feels like
[34:43.760 --> 34:47.680]  work though, even though it's a very nice app and I can't imagine how it would be better on a
[34:47.680 --> 34:52.960]  four inch display. It's the screen size, right? It's the screen size combined with the fact that
[34:52.960 --> 35:00.560]  on my Mac, it's just like, you know, command space, TRA, return, double click, I'm in,
[35:00.560 --> 35:05.440]  and it just is easier to drill down a file system and stuff like that.
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.520]  Uh, but it, you know, for the most part, but something like checking to see an email message
[35:11.520 --> 35:13.680]  or something like that, it doesn't feel like work on the iPhone at all.
[35:14.400 --> 35:17.360]  You know, I mean, you know, me, I, I tend to, uh,
[35:17.360 --> 35:23.840]  obsess over people who write lousy Apple analysis. Um, and, um, and so I, I go to all these like
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.960]  really crappy sites a lot. Um, and so I happened, you know, and I go to your site obviously too,
[35:28.960 --> 35:36.000]  but like, I noticed today that I, I loaded your site was already loaded in a tab. And so I,
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.160]  I hit refresh to make sure I was getting the latest. And then, um, and I, maybe I looked
[35:40.160 --> 35:43.920]  away for a second, but I came back and I looked and it was just sitting there. And so I hit
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.840]  refresh again, because I thought there's no way it refreshed in that amount of time because I'm
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.400]  just used to these things like Forbes and stuff where it's like, Oh, you want to hit refresh?
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.480]  Well, it's going to take like five minutes to load this page.
[35:56.640 --> 36:01.920]  My site is pretty fast. It's very fast. Uh, I noticed the same thing the other day.
[36:02.480 --> 36:09.920]  I went on a rant on during fireball about, uh, uh, the stupid, uh, JavaScript
[36:09.920 --> 36:16.240]  dick bars that they put up sites. And I just wrote offhand, you know, not really offhandedly,
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.560]  but I could do kind of mean it that, uh, I think that we'd have been better off if they'd never
[36:20.560 --> 36:25.920]  added JavaScript to web browsers. I mean, if you remember the original, it was, it was a document
[36:25.920 --> 36:31.040]  type thing, you know, and then the same way that like, when I send you an email code doesn't run
[36:31.040 --> 36:38.000]  on your, your device, I'm sending you bits and they are displayed. And the web was just,
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.600]  like any other internet thing at the time where you'd send text to somebody or you'd get text
[36:43.600 --> 36:50.640]  from a server and it would be displayed somehow. Um, the idea of adding scripting on the client
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.880]  side struck me as a bad idea immediately. Uh, and yes, it enabled all sorts of amazing things.
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.880]  And there's all sorts of web apps and things that are done in JavaScript that are useful
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.240]  and beautiful and, and cool, but there's so many awful things that people do with it by letting
[37:06.240 --> 37:11.840]  and you're just opening the door to, you know, the possibility of bad things happening. Whereas
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.640]  if there's no executable scripting at all, then nothing can happen. Yeah. I think you actually
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.240]  weren't talking about JavaScript. I think you were talking about the other thing that's scraping
[37:20.240 --> 37:25.840]  them. Oh, what was that? The names and like, if you type something in, if you don't hit submit,
[37:25.840 --> 37:31.040]  Oh my God, how awful is that? Oh, how awful is unbelievable. So if you didn't see it on
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.240]  during fireball, there's a Gizmodo had a expose where they found like hundreds of companies using
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.240]  this company's service. The scumbag company has now Navestone, Navestone, Germany, Christmas,
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.760]  they, they've got this JavaScript that you go to a form and it, as soon as you type anything
[37:47.760 --> 37:53.360]  in a field, it like phones home with the data. So like if you've ever idly like,
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.600]  maybe I'll buy this, maybe I won't, or maybe I'll sign up for this thing, but you kind of,
[37:57.600 --> 38:01.200]  you put your email in, but you don't hit submit and there's a big button that says submit and
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.040]  you think like, well, my email won't be sent to them until I hit submit. Nope. Soon as you type
[38:07.040 --> 38:14.080]  the letter J there it is. And people do. And, and I've, I've gotten email from readers too.
[38:14.080 --> 38:17.040]  And they've said that they've had this happen where they were like at a very specific site,
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.080]  like somebody was at like a site that sells like, uh, I don't know, Japanese tea, something very
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.680]  specific and did that, entered some information in a form and then thought the better thought,
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.000]  you know what, I don't want to get this. And three days later they got mail to their house,
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.040]  like actual junk mail from the Japanese tea company. Yeah. And that's the thing that they,
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.240]  they, they, they claim to be able to take that information and just like find your address,
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.920]  like, like find where you're living. And I guess from the, just from the email. Yeah. Some,
[38:45.920 --> 38:50.720]  some way, some database of looking up email addresses and associating with mailing addresses.
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.880]  And associated with mailing addresses. So anyway, yeah. I mean, and there's, there's a better
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.200]  example of why there should not be JavaScript or why you might not want JavaScript executing just
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.400]  by loading a page, right? If there's no scripting, all you're getting is a display, some, you know,
[39:06.400 --> 39:11.200]  information displayed text and video or images or something like that. And then nothing goes back
[39:11.200 --> 39:18.080]  to them until you click something. Anyway. Uh, what I did is I thought, you know what,
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.880]  I haven't tried for a while and I have, you know, I have one blocker, I have a content blocker and,
[39:23.440 --> 39:29.280]  uh, you know, I have some ads blocked and trackers blocked and stuff like that. And it does seem to
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.560]  speed things up. But I thought, you know what I haven't tried in a long time is what happens if
[39:32.560 --> 39:37.360]  you just turn JavaScript off. Cause that's a preference in Safari. You can just say,
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.000]  I don't want any JavaScript at all. And I did that and I had the same experience with,
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.120]  it was still Gizmodo's site. It loaded so fast that I, I thought it's gotta be wrong.
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.120]  And I was like, Oh my God, their site is so instantaneously fast. When you turn off
[39:51.120 --> 39:56.160]  JavaScript, it's all JavaScript that makes, that makes it take six seconds to load Gizmodo.
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.880]  Yeah. It's absolutely crazy that people just recklessly add all that. Every site
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.360]  in the internet could be fast by today's standards. If, if they didn't have all that crap.
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.640]  Yet here we are doing a lot of complaining about the way things are right now.
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.280]  My very favorite story that Forstall told, and I don't mind stealing it because it's so goddamn
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.480]  funny is that, uh, he said every time they went to, he went to cafe max with Steve Jobs,
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.040]  Jobs would insist on paying, even if Forstall was getting something that took a long time,
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.600]  like he's waiting for a pizza to get baked and Steve has already got his salad or whatever he
[40:33.600 --> 40:37.920]  had. And he's like, just go, go. You don't have to wait for me, go. And, and every time Jobs would
[40:37.920 --> 40:43.440]  wait at the cashier and that they had a system there, I guess they still have the system,
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.120]  but you just use your, uh, employee badge and it just docks the food from your paycheck. Um,
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.400]  I don't know if people know this or not, cause so many places in the Valley offer free food
[40:52.400 --> 40:58.560]  to their employees, but Apple does not offer free food. Uh, it's like, how do you get $200
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.080]  billion in the bank? Well, you don't give them free food. Right. Uh, but the, and eventually
[41:04.080 --> 41:07.120]  he, he said, Steve, you got to stop doing this. I can pay for my own food. And he goes, no,
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.160]  you don't understand. This gets docked out of your paycheck. Well, I only get paid a dollar a year.
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.120]  I don't know how, I don't know where this money's coming from.
[41:18.160 --> 41:24.000]  And Forstall starts laughing. He says, he's a, he's a billionaire and he's scamming the company.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.840]  And he said, Jobs says multi-billionaire. Yeah. That was it. That was, I think that was a
[41:29.840 --> 41:32.400]  different, that was a different editor. That was like, that was the thing where he's like telling,
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.120]  he's telling people that they're pricing, you're pricing that he was telling Jobs you're pricing
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.880]  this too high. Right? Like people like, you know, I have friends who can't afford this thing. And
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.960]  he's like, you, you, you, you think it's funny because you're a billionaire. And he says,
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.880]  I'm a multi-billionaire. Yeah. I just completed two stories. Anyway,
[41:46.880 --> 41:50.800]  the whole thing was chock full of good stories. I thought John Markoff did a pretty good job
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.320]  hosting it, uh, keeping it going. Boy. I felt like that could have gone on forever. I would
[41:56.320 --> 42:05.040]  like to see Forstall for three hours. It was very good. Sort of. I felt like I found the
[42:05.040 --> 42:09.680]  first three guys a little more, I don't know if it was relaxed or what it was. He felt like,
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.360]  I mean, he mentioned that he happened to mention that he was like, he was really into acting
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.000]  because you've talked about all these experiences that he's had since leaving Apple and on Broadway.
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.040]  Um, and he seemed like he was acting a little. Yeah. Um, the other guys just seemed more natural,
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.520]  like they were just shooting the breeze. Um, but this, the stories were still great and it's,
[42:29.520 --> 42:34.480]  it's, uh, it's certainly worth two hours or your time to watch the whole thing. I think.
[42:34.480 --> 42:40.080]  Yeah. Um, there is actually asked, I guess there were questions from the audience, uh,
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.720]  which were done the right way, by the way, the right way to do questions from the audience or
[42:44.720 --> 42:51.040]  from the internet is to have them written on cards and given to people standing up.
[42:51.040 --> 42:57.440]  Right. Never, ever, ever do it with people standing up because somebody will have inevitably
[42:57.440 --> 43:03.120]  like, it's like a, it's like flies drawn to a light bulb. People, people who can't, who can't
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.400]  get a good question out of their mouth, but just keep running, uh, will immediately go to the
[43:08.400 --> 43:16.080]  microphone. Uh, but one of the questions from the audience was, uh, uh, asking if for stall was
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.640]  wearing the same shirt that he wore at the 2012 WWDC and somebody looked it up and posted it to
[43:20.640 --> 43:29.600]  Twitter. It was, it is the same shirt. We go with what works, right? Uh, boy, it did seem, it did
[43:29.600 --> 43:33.680]  not seem like Scott for stalls been gone for five years. Hey, he looks great. You know, he's,
[43:33.680 --> 43:36.560]  doesn't look like he's, he looks exactly the, it looks exactly, it looks like he's been like
[43:36.560 --> 43:44.080]  an cryogenic chamber. I don't know about you. I, and part of it is, is, um, um, going gray over
[43:44.080 --> 43:48.480]  the last few years. Uh, but man, I mean, it's like, I look back at pictures from five years
[43:48.480 --> 43:54.480]  ago and I, I think, Holy hell, I'm, I'm really, I'm going to hell like, Oh yeah, this is getting
[43:54.480 --> 44:00.320]  old. Uh, or, you know, somebody will have a picture of it. There's a picture. Uh, we've got
[44:00.320 --> 44:07.440]  two babies in the family at the moment. Uh, and I like to hold babies. I do. I really do. I love
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.000]  babies. Uh, and I like it when, when the family get together, if there's two babies at the same
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.680]  time, I like to hold two babies at the same time. So Amy took a picture of me with two babies a
[44:17.680 --> 44:23.680]  couple of weekends ago at a family, a family birthday event. And, uh, and I love the picture
[44:23.680 --> 44:29.760]  because I, I, I look, uh, unlike almost all the time. I am in fact genuinely happy at that moment
[44:30.480 --> 44:34.640]  and you could see it, but I was like, Oh my God, look at all those lines around my eyes. Jesus,
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.160]  forced. I don't know what he's doing, but I don't like holding babies. Oh, I love, I never liked
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.880]  holding babies. And at him, I was like, when we decided to adopt, I was like, good. Cause then,
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.080]  you know, like he's going to be one. I won't have to carry this tight. We have this, we have these
[44:50.080 --> 44:55.120]  friends. Oh my God. They had, they had a, they had a kid like a number of years before we adopted
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.160]  Hank. And, um, this guy would flip the baby in the air. Yeah, that's what I do. I, well, I don't
[45:00.160 --> 45:04.480]  do that with other people's babies, but I did it with Jonas. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God. I would
[45:04.480 --> 45:09.440]  just, I would, it freaked me out. I had to leave. I mean, I just like, I would just like go into
[45:09.440 --> 45:15.600]  another room. I could not bear it. Oh, I like that. You were going to drop this kid. I am not
[45:15.600 --> 45:24.400]  going to be standing here when this kid suffers brain damage. I guess I do like throwing a baby
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.680]  in the air, but I must admit that they're probably as sure handed as I feel I am. I'm I, I guess the
[45:29.680 --> 45:34.240]  odds of me dropping a baby do increase slightly versus not throwing it in the air. I think you
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.160]  should, I think you, and also you're getting older, so you should not be throwing babies
[45:40.160 --> 45:50.240]  anymore. Eyesight isn't what it used to be. Your depth perception. I listen, unless you're standing
[45:50.240 --> 45:58.320]  over a ball pit or something like that, but pool maybe. Yeah. Uh, I thought it was uncanny how it
[45:58.320 --> 46:05.040]  seemed like forestall had only hadn't even left, like both the fact that he was wearing the same
[46:05.040 --> 46:12.480]  shirt and it just felt, you know, it's been five years since we've heard him on stage at an event
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.160]  and it did not feel like five years ago. It felt like, you know, like he was just a WWDC last week.
[46:18.880 --> 46:23.040]  Um, it's, and the other thing that was interesting about that whole thing was how many, apparently
[46:23.040 --> 46:28.560]  how many other executives or former executives or whatever were, or just people who worked on
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.280]  the phone were in the audience. Um, and they kept pointing, like they all kept pointing people out.
[46:33.280 --> 46:39.680]  Yeah. Um, and so I think that helped make it sort of relaxed.
[46:39.680 --> 46:46.400]  Yeah, yeah, I think so too. Uh, uh, I think, I know for a fact, uh, Matthew Panzorino was there
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.280]  and he told me he saw Bertrand Cerlet, uh, was in the audience. No surprise. Um,
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.920]  I know he, you know, he's been rather quiet since leaving Apple as well. Um,
[46:57.920 --> 47:04.000]  um, you know, I just app Apple people, you know, like, how do you, how do you fit in at a company
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.080]  where employees are expected to keep their mouth shut is you're naturally the sort of person who
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.000]  keeps your mouth shut. So it's not a surprise that you haven't heard from a lot of these people, but
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.680]  I feel like Bertrand's role in the iPhone is sort of, uh, I, and again, I haven't read the book,
[47:17.680 --> 47:24.000]  so maybe in that, uh, the new book, maybe there's a big chunk about Bertrand, but, uh, at a, at an
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.080]  at a, at an engineering level, uh, from what I've heard from multiple people, like at that point
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.960]  where there was this, well, do we, do we base it off a stripped down version of macOS 10 and the
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.880]  next libraries and everything, or do we build a thing from the ground up on Linux, like a,
[47:42.880 --> 47:48.640]  more like a gadget, you know, which was the Tony Fidel side of the thing. Um, and forced all
[47:48.640 --> 47:56.560]  obviously, uh, famously led the, what would become iOS, you know, led that team, but that, uh,
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.200]  actually like running the engineering and stuff like that Bertrand was a huge part of that as
[48:01.200 --> 48:06.640]  well. And, and was a big supporter of the fight in terms of, yes, I know it seems hard to believe now
[48:07.200 --> 48:15.440]  that this OS that doesn't really boot that fast on Intel PC hardware will be able to
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.320]  boot in a reasonable amount of time on a frigging cell phone. Uh, yeah, that was an interesting
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.120]  story. They talked about how they went down, um, and processors. They just kept, like,
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.880]  they started on a G5 and they got it to work and then they'd go down to G4 tower. And then
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.960]  he said, they eventually they were like down on a, like a tangerine iMac or iBook. Right. Right.
[48:36.960 --> 48:42.160]  Like they found one in a closet and just kept trying to make it run fast on crappier and
[48:42.160 --> 48:47.200]  crappier hardware. Uh, I wondered about that because like one of the images that came out,
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.440]  like all these images come out because of the, um, the legal stuff. But one of the images that
[48:51.440 --> 48:58.160]  came out was when I think when they were early on working on the, um, just, uh, just the tablet
[48:58.160 --> 49:01.680]  project before it became the phone project. And there was like, it was like a G3 tower.
[49:01.680 --> 49:06.640]  It was like a, like a blue and white G3 tower in the room, if I remember correctly. And I was like,
[49:06.640 --> 49:16.320]  why? I mean, like, why would you be using that in 2003 or four even? Hmm. I guess that explains it.
[49:18.880 --> 49:25.760]  It's one of those things though, that's, that's it. In 10 years, it's hard to overstate
[49:25.760 --> 49:33.520]  just how underpowered the ARM processor was in that original iPhone. Um, I mean, they show
[49:33.520 --> 49:39.120]  the hockey puck graph, you know, the hockey stick graph of GPU performance over time. They show it
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.440]  every year when they come out with new iPads and iPhones because the graph is still looking,
[49:43.440 --> 49:50.160]  it's still going up at a very sharp peak, but it's like, you have to remember we were back there at
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.640]  the origin of that graph and we loved it, right? We absolutely loved that phone. And that was with,
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.560]  you know, computing performance. That was the butt end of a joke in their slides today,
[50:00.560 --> 50:05.200]  you know? And, and on the other hand, you've got all these benchmarks showing that the iPad,
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.320]  the new iPad pro is significantly faster and just about any benchmark you can imagine
[50:10.320 --> 50:16.240]  than the MacBook with the Intel processor. Yeah. But that was a huge problem back then,
[50:16.240 --> 50:19.920]  obviously. I mean, it was probably these, it was probably these of all problems. It was probably
[50:19.920 --> 50:25.600]  the single biggest one. You got the sense from them that it was just like, it seemed like an
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.560]  impossible task to put. And that's why, that's why the announcement was so amazing. Cause it just
[50:30.560 --> 50:35.680]  seemed like, well, there's no way that they could make Mac OS X run on a phone. Right. Yeah. But he
[50:35.680 --> 50:39.600]  was like, right, right. And we're like, I don't, it looks like they did it.
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.960]  And it a very, a very unexpected, I mean, not in a way that you, that I thought of certainly before
[50:48.960 --> 50:56.240]  it was announced. No. It sounds like in a book it's, and again, I only read the Verge excerpt,
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.600]  but you mean in terms of like coming up with a user interface for it? Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like
[51:01.600 --> 51:08.880]  the book really has some great tidbits from, from those guys that participated. Greg Christie
[51:08.880 --> 51:15.840]  was the leader of what was then Apple's human interface group. And Boz Ording, I forget who
[51:15.840 --> 51:23.200]  the other names, they all have cool names, like super cool names. Yeah. But it was a really small
[51:23.200 --> 51:28.160]  team. Like that's one thing that I think is different about Apple then versus Apple today.
[51:28.160 --> 51:33.760]  Whereas I feel like that there is no, like it was like a dirty dozen group. You know what I mean?
[51:33.760 --> 51:38.160]  It was like Greg Christie and his like 12 handpicked UI guys who did the whole UI for
[51:38.160 --> 51:42.000]  the original iPhone. And I don't think that there isn't really a team like that anymore, ever since
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.000]  when Johnny Ive took over. I mean, it really does coincide with Forstall's Ouster, but to have one
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.360]  design group under Johnny Ive that does all design, industrial design, software design,
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.040]  there is no more like one 10 person team who could do something like that.
[51:59.280 --> 52:05.840]  Anything else from that event that stuck out? I guess it's worth observing that they didn't,
[52:05.840 --> 52:10.320]  and I'm guessing by gentleman's agreement that they didn't talk about Forstall's Ouster,
[52:10.320 --> 52:20.400]  that it really was focused. And historically, you know, I hope to hear that. I would love to personally
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.520]  be the person to talk to Forstall about that. I don't think that's the sort of thing though
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.720]  that plays well in front of a live audience. It would be a fantastic interview, but I think
[52:30.720 --> 52:36.240]  it should either be like, if it were recorded, it would should be like a non-live podcast.
[52:36.240 --> 52:41.920]  That would be fantastic. Or do it for, you know, record it, but do it for a written article.
[52:41.920 --> 52:48.160]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, we've seen where some of the stuff that's in this book ends up
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.680]  getting people in trouble. Yeah, definitely. I have to, you know, just to go meta for a second,
[52:55.680 --> 53:01.760]  like that does, it absolutely colors my questioning of like Schiller and Federighi two
[53:01.760 --> 53:08.960]  weeks ago at the live talk show. I guess the one question that there was even,
[53:09.520 --> 53:15.200]  did you listen to it? There was a heckler. It was like, I don't know, two thirds through the show,
[53:15.200 --> 53:21.840]  some shithead up in the balcony yells, when is Siri going to get good? I couldn't hear what
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.600]  the hell he said. I heard him say something, something Siri. And I thought, boy, I really
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.960]  hope because that's just two strikes and you're out is my rule for like a heckler. So I'll ignore
[53:32.960 --> 53:37.280]  it once. Yeah. And if it was, if he had done it again, then I would have had to interrupt the
[53:37.280 --> 53:43.120]  show and ask, ask people surrounding him to show him the exit. Make well, make them uncomfortable.
[53:43.120 --> 53:49.840]  I would have said, nobody's here to listen to you. That was the great I've filed it away in my
[53:49.840 --> 53:55.520]  memory where I was at a Louis CK show. Either I was at a Louis CK show or I was watching one on TV
[53:55.520 --> 54:01.120]  recorded and he got heckled and all he did was just stop his act, wait about two seconds.
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.840]  And he just said, nobody's here to listen to you shithead. And it's like, I was like,
[54:05.840 --> 54:10.960]  that's the greatest anti heckler thing ever. Like you don't even have to be clever. It doesn't
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.280]  matter what they heckled you with it because it's, you don't know, you know, you don't have to prove
[54:15.280 --> 54:21.040]  that you're clever enough to be funny and shutting them down on the fly by responding to whatever it
[54:21.040 --> 54:27.040]  is that he said. You just say something that is absolutely true and works. But anyway, right.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.760]  But there were people who said, well, then why didn't you drill them about Siri? And I kind of
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.640]  did, like, I tried to get at it with my question to them about, you know, most people in the
[54:38.640 --> 54:43.600]  industry seem to think that, you know, everybody agrees machine learning is, is the big thing for
[54:43.600 --> 54:50.080]  the next decade. And it's going to affect things large and small, new areas of technology,
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.960]  existing areas getting better. But the consensus seems to be that machine learning is best done
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.040]  in the cloud, perhaps at the expense of personal privacy, and Apple seems as committed as ever
[55:03.040 --> 55:09.280]  to doing it in a distributed fashion on devices. How confident are you guys in that strategy? And
[55:09.280 --> 55:14.720]  they both instantly said, very. And that, you know, gets at it, because that obviously part
[55:14.720 --> 55:18.320]  of that is Siri, you know, but so what am I going to say, they're obviously confident in it. And if
[55:18.320 --> 55:24.160]  I get up there and rant about how bad Siri is, a I don't believe that that's true. Like, I'm actually
[55:24.160 --> 55:28.480]  among, you know, people who write and talk about these things. I think I'm a little more pro Siri
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.720]  versus the competition than most people. So it's not even my honest opinion. But even if for the
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.920]  sake of devil's advocate, I just don't think it's a great question in a live audience, because
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.880]  they're not going to say anything. Yeah, there's a certain contingent of people who wants me to
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.040]  belittle them, because they're so upset about serious performance that they want me to.
[55:47.040 --> 55:51.680]  They want me to make Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi look small, apologize, right? Apologize
[55:51.680 --> 55:56.080]  or something. And that's not going to happen. And it wouldn't play well on stage. But like,
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.760]  when I've had them on the show, and it's not in front of a live audience, I feel like I ask it
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.760]  very different. It's a different interview style. Like, you have to play to the audience.
[56:05.760 --> 56:09.760]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's Yeah, right. I mean, in a way, it's an entertainment
[56:10.400 --> 56:14.400]  thing. It becomes more of an entertainment thing when it's in front of an audience. Right. And I
[56:14.400 --> 56:21.200]  feel like and, you know, everyone's drinking. And it's like, you know, it really is.
[56:22.400 --> 56:28.880]  As somebody who gets up on stage in front of several hundred or 1000 people once in a while,
[56:28.880 --> 56:34.720]  but has done it, you know, once in a while for going on 10 years. It's, it's like, I'm not,
[56:34.720 --> 56:40.240]  it's not like normal to me, it always, always feels extremely abnormal, I would say,
[56:40.240 --> 56:49.120]  for up to 48 hours in advance, and, you know, up to 24 hours afterwards. But if it's a lot easier
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.800]  to think that, you know, you, when you're up there, and there's people, you're, you cannot
[56:54.800 --> 57:00.160]  not be cognizant of the fact that you've got an audience to entertain. Yeah, you know, and,
[57:00.160 --> 57:05.600]  and it's weird, because, you know, I don't know, 100,000 people watched the video afterwards,
[57:05.600 --> 57:11.840]  the video afterwards, and there's 1000 people who were in that theater. And so, in theory,
[57:11.840 --> 57:19.680]  it would make more sense to play to optimize for the whole money. Yeah, but you can't, you can't
[57:19.680 --> 57:24.000]  not do it. And it's the same reason I because you ruin you ruin the whole thing. If you I mean,
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.720]  if I tried to do that, right, and it's exactly why, you know, the tonight show or the late show,
[57:30.720 --> 57:37.200]  you know, a late night talk show has a different vibe to it than the evening news. Right? It's
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.120]  like when they're, you know, or why the Daily Show had a different vibe than than the CBS evening
[57:43.120 --> 57:47.520]  news, even though it was the same thing, a guy reading the news on camera, because there was
[57:47.520 --> 57:56.720]  an audience there. Totally changes it. Anyway. Good thing I'm keeping the show moving. Let me
[57:56.720 --> 58:04.320]  take a break and thank our next sponsor. And boy, do I love these guys. This is a great new sponsor
[58:04.320 --> 58:11.600]  recent recently new sponsor for the show away away uses high quality materials to make really,
[58:11.600 --> 58:17.760]  really nice luggage. They've got four, no nine colors and four sizes. They've got the carry on
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.280]  the bigger carry on the medium and the large. I love the names even because the names tell you
[58:23.280 --> 58:28.000]  exactly how big these suitcases are. They're all made with premium German polycarbonate.
[58:28.560 --> 58:34.400]  And it's really strong. They've got four wheel rollers, which is fantastic. And it's like the
[58:34.400 --> 58:37.840]  rollers are so easy. You just put this thing on the four rollers and you just like touch it with
[58:37.840 --> 58:43.520]  one finger and it just rolls down the airport with you. A TSA approved combination lock. I don't know
[58:43.520 --> 58:48.720]  how good that is those locks, you know, but it's the best you can do that's legal. And thing about
[58:48.720 --> 58:57.440]  the carry on that is so clever is it has a built in battery charger and a couple of USB ports up
[58:57.440 --> 59:03.600]  there. So when you're at the airport and you're waiting, you don't have to hunt for the one seat
[59:03.600 --> 59:09.280]  that's near a power outlet. You can just sit anywhere and you could charge your phone or
[59:09.280 --> 59:13.840]  charge two phones at the same time. And the battery because you know, it's small for the
[59:13.840 --> 59:17.680]  suitcase, but it's actually bigger than the type of charger you'd put in a like you've carried in
[59:17.680 --> 59:20.960]  your pocket or something like that. It's big enough that they could charge a fully charge
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.880]  an iPhone five times on a single charge. It's a great feature. I've used it. I have one of these
[59:26.880 --> 59:31.120]  and I have used that feature because I for whatever reason, I think as soon as you go in an
[59:31.120 --> 59:35.520]  airport, your phone just instantly loses 20 percent battery just had it just instantly. It's like
[59:35.520 --> 59:40.240]  just the way they build airports and it's like a Faraday cage. It's like its signal is so bad.
[59:40.240 --> 59:46.240]  You need to charge it. It's a great product. And last but not least, they have just like a lot of
[59:46.240 --> 59:53.120]  these podcast advertisers. They have a super generous trial period by one of their suitcases
[59:53.120 --> 59:58.640]  and you get 100 days. You can live with it, travel with it, put it through the airport,
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.720]  check baggage and let them toss it around. And up to 100 days later, if you're not happy with it,
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.520]  they'll just give you a full refund and you send it back and you get a full refund. I mean, that's
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.280]  that. Does that make any sense? No, but it's that's how confident they are that you're going
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.920]  to like it. You even get free shipping on any away order within the lower 48 states. Sorry, Alaska.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:28.880]  Anyway, go check them out. The URL, which I should know, but I don't have handy is
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:38.640]  awaytravel.com slash talk show away travel slash talk show and use that URL and you'll save 20
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.840]  bucks off your suitcase, 20 bucks right in your pocket. My thanks to them. I'll be packing an
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.640]  away suitcase probably within half an hour of getting off the show today.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.800]  I really will. That's the honest to God truth. I wouldn't say it if it weren't true, John.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.800]  I wasn't questioning you. I think I said this before. I travel more than most people probably.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:09.680]  I mean, you know, I travel for work, travel for vacation with the family and stuff like that. I've
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.960]  had that I had up until I got this away thing. I had the same carry on suitcase since I can
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.400]  remember. And I don't I had it for so long that I don't even remember why I bought it originally,
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:27.760]  because I had it from before I regularly flew on airplanes. I don't know. And having an old
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.680]  busted ass suitcase, it's with like wheels that don't really turn right and make noise. It was
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.000]  like the upgrade of a lifetime. Like, and it's just one of those things where I don't know, I
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.960]  waste money on so much stuff, as you well know. But it ever seemed to me like the suitcase was
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.640]  still structurally sound. And you know, it wasn't ripped. It was just worn and wheels especially.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.400]  And so it never that never seems like something worth spending, you know, money on. It's like,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.800]  well, you know, I don't need to just use this old one. I'll tell you what getting a new suitcase was
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.080]  a hell of an upgrade. I like this. I really like the sound of that one that has the power in it.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.320]  Oh, it's a fantastic feature. It really is because you never get it. You never get power at the
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.160]  airport. Never know. There's always that one guy who's got like eight devices plugged into the two.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.960]  Yeah. Oh, that guy. Yeah, that's that's BS. That's that's that's that's total crap.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.560]  That's it. It's just a dick move. It really is. It's like taking a four top for you know,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.160]  you're you're like a one person. You take a four top at a seat yourself restaurant.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.480]  Oh, yeah. You know, go sit at the bar if you're by yourself. You know what I mean?
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.120]  All right. What else we got on the agenda? Anything else? Anything else from the from the event?
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.120]  No, I mean, just another like another I don't want to give away all the anecdotes.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.520]  I don't want the jobs anecdotes. So that was the only other one. But so just watch it and you'll
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.760]  you'll learn all the jobs anecdotes. It does make you wonder like what Apple looks like if
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:02.160]  forestall hadn't left. Was there a path? You know what? Yeah. What exactly was the nature of that
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.400]  that rift and the personal dispute? I mean, there's reports that Tim Cook used to have to
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  attend every meeting that was attended. I think it was Johnny and forestall, but it might have
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.640]  involved. I thought it was a big Bob. Yeah, it might have been might have been there might have
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.160]  been multiple people who refused to attend any meeting with Scott forestall unless Tim Cook was
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:32.960]  there. And as you might imagine, the company that was making all their money from iPhones and iPads
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.840]  had a lot of meetings with Scott forestall. But boy, yeah, that's it. Yeah, you can't,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.560]  you can't keep doing that. But there was I mean, there's just no denying it, though, that that
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.520]  there was there's an aspect of Scott forestall that you can see why he was so in tune with Steve
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.320]  Jobs. You know, you can see why they had like almost a symbiotic relationship that there's
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.640]  there is a certain Steve ness to his way of looking at products and design and technology.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.720]  Yeah. I thought it was interesting. I knew that I actually knew this, I think.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.480]  But Markoff asked them something about skeuomorph skeuomorphism. And and forestall was like,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.920]  you know, I'd never even heard of the word skeuomorphism until after, you know,
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.560]  people started blaming him for skeuomorphism. Right? It's just like, I just know good design.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.160]  And I'm sure that's true. They get to skeuomorphism does sound like a word that was
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.480]  made up by people who don't like what it is. Like, the name does seem sort of negative.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.280]  Right. I didn't know what it was until that whole thing blew up either. Did you know? I mean,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.080]  it was no I'd heard of before. I'd never heard of it before. And I was never satisfied. I always
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.400]  every time I put it on during fireball, I was always I still am if I ever comes up again.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.040]  It's, it just seems like a void in our vocabulary to talk about it. You know,
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:05:00.960]  I think I think it's better to talk about like textures and depth, rather than flatness. And
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:07.920]  even the word flatness is overdone. But there's no denying that. Nobody, you can quibble over
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.200]  what words we use, but you can't deny that iOS seven was flattened compared to iOS six.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:18.560]  Things that used to look like they were 3d were now completely 2d. Yeah.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.520]  Let's think about this. How about this story that the outline had?
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:34.160]  On the leaks? Yeah. So Apple, Apple has been hosting apparently a series of unsurprisingly,
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.320]  Apple has a team of investigators to investigate product leaks. And they're people, you know,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.440]  formerly employed by, like the FBI, and the I don't know, CIA or Secret Service. You know,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.800]  yeah, unsurprisingly, this kid, well, this came out, remember, when the iPhone four got stolen,
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.840]  or appropriated, or whatever you want to call it, picked up in a bar, and not returned.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.480]  They did this, I think that came out then that they had these investigators that were working
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.080]  in house and people were, some people at least were kind of like, Whoa, why is Apple employing
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:16.240]  these thugs? It's like, because they're a huge company, and they're not they're not things,
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.720]  they're just like, they're looking into, you know, making sure that other companies don't
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:27.280]  steal their intellectual property. Yeah, that it was definitely a little bit more faux outrage.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:34.560]  And when that phone was stolen, at the reaction, but it's like, if you really look at what they
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.000]  did, there was no step of the way that did that seemed inappropriate to me. But there's some
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.440]  people who seemingly, you know, like, seemingly think Apple shouldn't enforce this at all in the
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:52.000]  interest of free speech of their employees, I guess, you know, that it's oppressive to, to
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.840]  do anything in response. It doesn't make any I don't understand. Yeah. How these people
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.920]  think like that. But I mean, and there's a line in there. I forget the name of the guy who does
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:08.560]  the I think it's the guy right who does the presentation, who they name. But he talks
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:15.520]  about how they're, they're not talking about whistleblowers, right? They're, they're, you know,
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.600]  if Apple is doing something that's illegal, right there, this team, we want you to go ahead and tell
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.000]  people or, you know, or if it's like a harassment type thing, you know, like, if you feel like,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.360]  you know, you've been, you know, you're not being treated fairly because of your skin color, or
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.000]  your, your sexual orientation, or whatever, and you want to report it, this team doesn't come
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.840]  after you. This team is specifically devoted to product leaks, it actually is.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.400]  And they even said, like, we don't, you know, they have no capability to monitor employee email,
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.520]  etc. They just investigate things after the fact. I did, there was the article touched on
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.880]  the fact that they have a SWAT team for an accidental email. And then they'd never really
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.040]  followed up on it. But, you know, the fact that email once sent can't be unsent. And so if you,
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.840]  you know, like, do like an accidental reply all, and in a reply all chain include somebody who's
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.920]  not disclosed on something that you just said to only the people who are supposed to be disclosed,
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.440]  they have like a process, you know, like, you can hit like the, hit the red button on your desk,
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.120]  and they'll quick come in and do their best to. But I'm curious more about what exactly they do.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.000]  Do you mean to get rid of email? I don't know, I would like to know, is it really only an internal
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.480]  thing? Is it, you know, internal apple.com? What happens if it goes to somebody who's out in the
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:42.560]  outside world? You know, is there sort of a not like a brute squad, but like, yeah, almost like
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:51.200]  a PR team who comes to, you know, sort of bribe you? Or, you know, Joel, you know, I don't know.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.800]  Do you know what I mean? Like, yeah, sounds like there's a process for like, you know,
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.880]  so you mean like, if it goes to some reporter, the New York Times or something like that?
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.200]  Well, that would be I think, dude, I think if it went to a reporter, they'd know they're screwed.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.000]  And yeah, and it would go through in any anything would go through Apple PR at that point. But if it
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.240]  just goes to random, I don't know, parts like a partner. Yeah, like a partner. Okay. Right. You
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.720]  know, do they have like, I would guess that they have like an official team that goes to like,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.600]  yeah, encourage them to keep your mouse up. Like, right. You're in the loop now. But we're all
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.040]  friends, right? Yeah.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.480]  And apparently, I mean, there, as far as like the supply chain, for years, we were always
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.600]  talking about the supply chain being the weak link.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.360]  Yeah, that was the big news.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.400]  Information, right? Yeah.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.280]  And it's not now. And now it's not as of like, a couple of years or so.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.640]  Or just like last year, I think they said, the first time where there were more leaks
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.280]  from Cupertino than from outside. And from the supply chain partners.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.560]  Yeah, which I found very interesting. Yeah, I found that I thought that was very
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.800]  interesting, too. And I'm not sure from the outside, it jibes with my view of the company
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.160]  still seems to me like we see an awful lot of unless they're false. You know what I mean?
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.400]  We start we're seeing so many of these iPhone parts, parts coming out. Right.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.760]  And I'm not, I don't see much that's leaking from inside the company. You know, I've mentioned it
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:24.000]  before, but you know, like iOS 11 and MacOS. Going into WWDC, there was really not much.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.760]  No, almost nothing. I would say the least of any year in memory.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.440]  Yeah. And, you know, maybe with High Sierra,
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.360]  part of it is that there's just, it's not that there aren't that many new features, period.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:42.560]  But iOS 11 is certainly as, as big a change as any other year other than iOS, the big change
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:51.280]  with iOS 7. Yeah. What else was? He talked about, he talked about the number of people that they
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.640]  have working in the in the supply chain or at any given time, which I thought was interesting
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:02.400]  and compared it and compared it to the number of people who go through the top 25 theme parks in
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.440]  the world. Oh, right.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.360]  On any given day. I thought that was a little unfortunate comparison. Like it's a really
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.720]  crappy theme park. Foxconn land.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.320]  Slaving away, Shenzhen.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.680]  Wouldn't that be great if that's how they started getting people to build phones, if they just,
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.440]  they just brand it as like a Disney theme park, but the theme is.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.480]  You can't, but you can't get out. Yeah. The theme is working. Yeah.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.520]  The theme is you've got, you've got to put 20 iPhones together by the end of the day,
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:45.920]  no matter how long it takes. I, I, the other thing that was curious was that the inner
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.400]  or the outline made clear that they had a recording of this whole session and that they
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:57.280]  said there was about a hundred people present. Again, I, there is this irony in a, in a
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.240]  presentation on Apple's anti leaking efforts, actually leaking and presumably whoever leaked
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.040]  it must have been offended in some way. I can't imagine what would motivate somebody
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.320]  who worked at Apple, who was at this presentation to record it and leak it to the outline. I
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.720]  really, I really find that baffling. Well, I think what might've, I mean, I'm
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.480]  speculating what might've happened is that they record the session and then they put
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.040]  it online in the, on their intranet. So that people who couldn't attend the session could
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:32.800]  watch it. So it was easier to get the, to get it to somebody else. Like, maybe it's
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.760]  just like a. Oh, that might, that makes sense. And that
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.040]  actually, if that's the case, it would, it would, it would change my thinking on this
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.120]  was that they could, if there weren't, they did, the outline did not release the whole
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.040]  recording. And I think for the sake of protecting their sources, you know, that, but they just
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.040]  wrote about it, but there were direct quotes, but I feel like they could use those quotes
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.200]  to figure out which, you know, cause this presentation has been given to employees over
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.480]  and over. This is like something that's regularly given. Yeah. And they could triangulate exact
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.080]  quotes to say, this was the one that we gave on May 13th. And here were the people who
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.240]  were there, you know, the people who are these crack law enforcement agents who are investigators
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.760]  could, could narrow down the list of people who were there pretty quickly if, if it had
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.760]  to be recorded at the session. Yeah. Right. I mean, I don't know. I don't
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.640]  know what, I don't know how they got it, but, um, I just know from having worked at a company
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.520]  that a lot of times, like if you work in a, in an operations unit and they have like some
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.200]  sort of thing that everybody's supposed to go to, you might not be able to go because
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.040]  you're, unless you're doing it at off hours or something, because you're, you need to
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.520]  be there all the time. Right. So, yeah, I could see it being like that, but I think
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.560]  that you could watch it from your desk, but you can't, like I'm under the impression of
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.160]  that that presentation is given all the time. So it may not have been recorded because if
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.640]  you couldn't make the one on May 13th, you could just go to the one that's June 13th.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.320]  Right. On the other hand, there was nothing in it that was, you know, other than the mild
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.080]  irony of an anti-leaking presentation being leaked, there really wasn't anything in there
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.720]  that was, that made Apple look bad. It's just something that they don't want to talk about.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:19.120]  Right. Anyway, good scoop for the outline. It was, it was also funny that you were name checked.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.920]  Yes, that was true. They, uh, they pointed out my, my recent observations on
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.760]  scoops having run a bit dry lately for Mark Gurman and they, they seem to
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.200]  response. I think it was in the, it was in the Q and a part. Yeah. Maybe, I don't know.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.800]  Yeah, I think so. And it was just, uh, so it was, it was not, I know that you're part of the,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.960]  uh, the canned presentation, but, um, somebody asked a question and in response to the question,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:52.800]  uh, that, that, uh, was suggested, uh, that it's working. I mean,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.800]  basically that what you were saying was showing that it was working. Yeah. Well,
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.040]  in particular, I, I, you know, who knows? I mean, the kid has had a remarkable number of scoops,
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.880]  but he hasn't had any ones recently. And the, the one in particular, I guess I should address it on
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.920]  the show, uh, with the home pod, you know, he, there was nothing that Gurman reported about the
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.360]  home pod that hadn't been reported at least a month earlier by Ming Chi Kuo or, uh, I forget
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.720]  the other guy. There was another guy who had a bunch of tweets about stuff. Um, and Ming Chi Kuo
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.280]  had this thing. What is this thing on the top? Is it a display or not a display? And I got caught in
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.560]  a little squibble with people during WWDC about whether it's a display or not. It's definitely
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.640]  touch. You can touch it. And it definitely shows a plus and minus buttons when it's playing audio.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:47.600]  And so it changes from the little Siri wave form to showing a plus and minus. Um, but it's starting
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.240]  to sound like from what people are saying, that it's not like what you would think of as a display
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.360]  with like 200 pixels per inch and it can display anything like the plus and minus buttons might
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:03.040]  literally be hard, hard coded buttons, more like, you know, the buttons on like your microwave oven
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:12.640]  or something like that. Um, and that the wave form is somehow done with just like three colored LEDs
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.240]  and a diffuser. Uh, it's, I didn't see it long enough to know. I mean, it definitely looked
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.760]  so projected onto that instead of sort of, yeah, something like that. Um, although that's,
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.360]  it seems like an awful lot of work when they could just do it with a screen and then they'd
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.800]  have the flexibility of changing in the future, but it's starting to sound like it's not really
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:38.400]  a screen in terms of being able to display any arbitrary UI. Uh, and it's just, but it is a
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.680]  touch panel and it does light up and it does show things. So, you know, in some definition,
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.760]  it's a screen, but it's not worth worrying about. But at the main point in terms of
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:53.120]  observing Mark Gurman's, uh, scoops is that he, he had nothing on that. Like there was nothing
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:17:00.080]  in his report that mentioned any, all he said, like the squabble is, uh, he said, you know,
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.720]  he compared it to the new Amazon thing that has a real display, like a TV in your kitchen
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.960]  and that Apple's doesn't have anything like that. And that's all he said. So he obviously didn't
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.120]  know about the touch panel on top because he didn't mention anything about it. Yeah.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.360]  And it's just an interesting observation that, uh, and you know, you know, he,
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.880]  tomorrow he could hit publish on a huge scoop about an amazing thing that we haven't heard
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.000]  about it. You know, he's only, you know, he's always one, you know, verified tidbit away from
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.320]  publishing one. So, I mean, it could obviously end at any time, but it's, it's obviously the
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.840]  case that he hasn't had anything exclusive in a long time. So is it your, do you think that he
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.880]  gets this information from people inside Apple or people in the supply chain? I suspect both.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:48.000]  Uh, I think he also, I suspect just back, you know, I've always been curious at the meta level
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.400]  of, you know, his stuff. I think he used to have somebody in the store, somebody in the retail
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.520]  chain cause he'd get a lot of stuff at about the time that it might start percolating through
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:03.920]  retail. Um, but like, for example, he must have somebody inside Apple though, at some level,
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.840]  like his, his best recent scoop was the AirPods. Like he had, he described AirPods like eight
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.720]  months before they were announced and nobody else had it. I think he even had the name AirPods,
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:20.880]  although that might've come from like a trademark filing and I guess, um, but he had the whole,
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.920]  you know, the description was spot on and, and the, the whole idea that you would have like the,
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.840]  the little case and that that's where you, you know, that they'd last for like a couple
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.600]  hours on their own, but then you just pop them in the case and they charge back up.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.560]  Uh, you know, he had all of that before anybody did. So that had to have come somewhere within
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.000]  Apple. I mean, I guess in theory it could have come from the supply chain, but timing wise,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.760]  it seems like that was too early for the supply chain. I think it came from somewhere within,
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:52.000]  I think it came from somebody who was working on AirPods and the thing that he had wrong about it
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.400]  was weird because he had it, he was projecting that it would be a Beats product, even though
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.160]  Beats did come out with their own thing. Uh, but it's, there was no way, but product marketing
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.240]  decisions are the ones that leak the least like you'd think that the same people who worked on
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.040]  the AirPods might work on the HomePod, but maybe not. Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I don't know. It's
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:18.080]  hard to say. Anyway, it'd be interesting. And the other thing too is I wouldn't be totally surprised.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:24.960]  I mean, it would seem unlikely, but, uh, what I've heard is what, why, why was HomePod only announced
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.920]  and not, why isn't it shipping until December? And my understanding is that it's software that
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.760]  the iOS software, I don't know if it's the device that actually, the software that runs on the
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:39.120]  device or the software that runs on like your iPhone and iPad that you can shoot music over to
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:45.360]  it, but it's the software is not ready is what I've heard. Um, and at the hardware it's is,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:52.640]  you know, ready, readier to go. I don't know. Um, so I don't expect that they would replace that top
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.360]  touch panel with, you know, from a fake screen to a real screen between now and December,
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:05.120]  but you never know. Yeah. Uh, and I do suspect that strategically, uh, like think about why
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.880]  would Apple announce this product so early? Well, because they don't have anything that it's
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:15.520]  competing against, right? They're not, uh, what's that company that, that famously, uh, put themselves
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.280]  in bankruptcy by a preannouncing their, uh, their upcoming computer. Oh yeah. Who was that? Osborne
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.800]  computer company. So Osborne had like a PC and it was in the early years when it was so fun and
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:33.360]  there were like 14 different companies with their own competing, uh, uh, PC platforms and Osborne
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.120]  is one of them. And they got up and said, here's what our next one is going to do. And it's going
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.400]  to be so amazing. And so everybody stopped buying the one that they were selling by this crap.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.240]  They went out of business before they could ship the one that they were talking about.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.840]  So Apple can't Osborne itself with this because they don't sell a smart speaker right now,
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.640]  right? That's the same reason they could pre-announce the iPhone in January when it
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.040]  didn't go on sale until the end of June. All in fact, strategically, it makes sense because it
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.160]  might stop people from buying competing products in the interim, right? Like it makes me a little
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.440]  less likely to buy a new Alexa. Uh, if I, if I think I could wait till December and maybe
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:18.560]  choose between that and this. Um, but then on the flip side, all they demoed was how good it sounds
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:25.600]  because it sounds so much better than the Alexa. Um, so you, you heard the, yes, the sound,
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:30.320]  you could hear it playing. I, they had played like six songs for us in a reasonably,
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:37.520]  what could reasonably be a, a living room. Yeah. Uh, it sounded fabulous. Yeah. Truly fabulous.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:44.160]  But, but no one touched anything. No, not allowed to touch. Yeah. Uh, and somebody,
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.200]  I was in a demo with like four other people and the one guy, uh, uh, at the end of it,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.720]  uh, they, you know, I asked if I could touch the plus and minus buttons and they said, no,
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:22:00.720]  uh, uh, and the one guy, uh, said, Hey Siri, and tried to get it to, uh, try to get it to talk.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.880]  And they were like, nice try. No, but the other thing that, but they showed so little of the
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:13.040]  software, uh, in both, in terms of what you can do by touching the thing itself and, uh, and how
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.280]  you're going to control it and how you're going to set it up that it, but that makes sense that they
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.640]  wouldn't show that just because they wouldn't want, that's the sort of thing that, that if
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.120]  they have any clever ideas, they don't want to give their would be competitors a heads up and
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:31.200]  copy them. Right. Right. You know, I do wonder, I do wonder if they just, I mean, if at this point
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:38.240]  they just have the, like the speaker hardware finalized and maybe there's a bunch of other
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.200]  things that control it that they're not set on yet. No, I heard through the grapevine that this
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:48.880]  is a product that has been being worked on for a while. And, and that more or less, there was a
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:53.520]  team working on it for a while, but it got no interest at the top levels of the company. But
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.640]  then once like Alexa really started taking off and getting a lot of press, they were like, don't
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.320]  we have a thing, don't we have people working on this? Can we ship one of these tomorrow? Yeah.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.600]  And they were like, yeah, we got these guys over there and, you know, building whatever,
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.480]  working on it. And then they like went over and looked at it and then they were like,
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:13.280]  Hey, this sounds amazing. Uh, like Shiller even said at my show, like the team that does the,
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.920]  the acoustics of this is, uh, you know, super, super talented. I mean, the thing really does
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.520]  sound amazing. Yeah. Uh, it sounds good. And it does not sound like one device. It does not sound
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:29.920]  like, you know, th th th this fake, uh, they're simulated surround sound. It's a real thing.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.880]  It's a, you know, I'm not saying it actually sounds better than having two speakers,
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.760]  but it certainly doesn't sound like one speaker. Yeah. I have a Sonos and Sonos sounds great too.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.040]  Yeah. And the Sonos that they had next to it sounded very good, but not quite as good.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.080]  Yeah. But that was very, uh, a nice thing that they did by having the Sonos there.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.320]  Uh, what were we talking about? Leaks.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:59.040]  Leaks. As I talk about somebody who told me that the team had been working on this for a while.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.200]  Well, that's, that's more of a, that's more of a positive story, right? That's not, that's not
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.920]  like a. Yeah. And it's not really a leak. It's just, it's not going to, nobody's going to have a,
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.000]  uh, it's not going to be a Mac rumors story tomorrow. John Gruber says on podcast that
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.120]  Apple had a team working on home pod and working on this people.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.360]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor. And then we're
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:34.160]  hit the home home stretch of the show. It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.160]  Squarespace is where you go to make your next move. Look, what next thing you're going to start,
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.080]  you're going to need a website for where you go to make a new website. Start at Squarespace. They
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.960]  handle everything. They do domain name registration. They have all the hosting.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.720]  They provide all the analytics, the stats. You could see where, you know, where your traffic's
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.880]  coming from, which pages are popular, where the referrals are coming from, all the analytics,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.080]  all built in. They have a storefront, they handle all that secure stuff, the credit card processing,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:07.680]  the SSL, uh, you know, to, to make sure everything goes over HTTPS. And the thing they're most famous
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.040]  for is they have all this design where they have all these templates to choose from. And
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:17.840]  they're super customizable and your Squarespace site can look like your brand, not like, oh,
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.720]  it's one of the seven well-known Squarespace templates. I'm telling you, you will be shocked
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.160]  how many businesses and sites that you go to are Squarespace sites that you just have no idea.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.240]  Just poke around sometime. Like when a new restaurant opens up and has a very cool looking
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.360]  website view source and see if it's Squarespace up there in the little HTML headers. And you'll,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.560]  you'll be surprised like last three times I've done that here in Philadelphia with a new
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.440]  restaurant. Um, it's been Squarespace. Um, in fact, I think there's even a shortcut. I think
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.440]  you can just hit the escape key and it's like a Squarespace shortcut for like getting to their
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.720]  control panel. Um, anyway, I cannot emphasize enough how much time effort you'll, you'll save
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.240]  by going with Squarespace instead of doing this yourself and how much money you'll save versus
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.760]  like paying thousands and thousands of dollars to have somebody build you a website. You could
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.320]  just do it yourself. You don't have to be an expert on web design or, uh, the web technologies.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.760]  It's like Squarespace makes it as possible to just do your website yourself and have it look great
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.560]  as like word processing was back in the day, as opposed to hiring somebody to type up a
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.400]  professional resume for you. Right. It's like, that's what they've done for the web
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.920]  really is it's they've taken it to that level. Um, they sponsor the show all the time. You've
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.000]  heard of them. Uh, but they, they keep sponsoring because you guys keep going there and checking
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.640]  them out. So do it. Remember, go to squarespace.com and use this offer code Gruber, my last name,

[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.400]  So you could save 10% for the entire year if you use that code Gruber. So remember that. And, uh,
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.640]  my thanks to them for supporting the show and my thanks to all of you who, who are apparently
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:04.320]  making Squarespace websites and using that code. Did you, uh, you see, you saw the report that,
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:12.320]  well, speculation that the iMac Pro, the keyboard might come with touch ID. I guess it has a, uh,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.960]  yeah. Uh, I wonder if they could do it over the air though, to the keyboard. Uh, yeah, somebody,
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:26.240]  somebody who is this, uh, Pike, what's his name? Christopher Pike. No, that's the captain on
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:33.920]  Star Trek. Anyway, I'm sure it'll be in your show notes, but, uh, the iMac Pro comes with a, uh,
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.280]  secure enclave processor. Yeah. They, and they figured this out by looking at, I don't know if
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.040]  it was High Sierra, probably High Sierra, cause there's no reason that it would be in regular
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.880]  Sierra since the iMac Pro is never going to run regular Sierra. Uh, somebody was poking around
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.200]  the bits of the High Sierra developer beta and they found there's also, you know, you can often
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.520]  find little tidbits of upcoming hardware in there. And, uh, long story short, you know, the proof of
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.080]  it, you know, you have to be like a super nerd to figure it out, but it looks like it might have
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.200]  an ARM coprocessor like the, the touch ID sensor in the MacBooks, MacBook Pros. I wonder though,
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.800]  if they could do it wirelessly. I mean, it'd be cool if they did, but maybe the touch ID sensor
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:21.440]  would be somewhere, you know, it'd be like the, uh, trying to get the SD card slot in the back.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.520]  Well, but they, um, they do, uh, they do Apple pay.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.960]  So you can, I mean, you can pay, like if you don't have like, I've touched
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.880]  our MacBook Pro, but, um, you can Apple pay from your phone or from your watch on your Mac.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.280]  Yeah. But that's different than having the actual processor, you know what I mean? The actual system
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.960]  on a chip, you know what I mean? Like you could do Apple pay on, I could do Apple pay on my old
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:53.760]  MacBook here. Yeah, it does. As it's, you know, Apple, you just need, you can do it,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.840]  you can validate from your phone or from your watch. Yeah. I could do it from my phone. Like
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.000]  if I go to somebody's website who has Apple pay on your website, it'll just ping my phone and I
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.920]  can touch it. So it doesn't have any, well, no, this would be, I don't know how this,
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.360]  well, they could put the sensor in the keyboard, although they've shown the keyboard and it didn't
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.000]  look like it had, it didn't look like it had one. Yeah. Right. Um, who knows, who knows what they're
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.680]  doing with it? You know, it could be that they've got that, you know, they've, they've got a little
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:29.120]  iOS processor in there for an entirely different reason. You know, you know, like in the way that,
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:36.400]  uh, your AirPods are really tiny little iOS computing devices, you know, but you don't think
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.160]  of them as such, there might be some sort of cool feature in there, but they were like, well,
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.280]  we could do it, but it would almost be like building a computer and a computer and they'd be
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:49.760]  like, well, we can do that, but who knows if it's touch ID. Yeah. It seems at some point that, that
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:58.000]  I just, it's not like if you're not, if you're not gonna have the stuff available on all your
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000]  platforms, that seems kind of weird to me, but I guess you, and you can do the touch bar on,
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.400]  on everything. I guess so. I'm, I'm a little bit surprised that the new Mac book didn't have the
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.680]  touch bar and, and there were no rumors about it having it, but I just thought, well, why wouldn't
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.840]  they, you know, like, it's not like the thing is sold at a discount. It's pretty expensive computer
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:23.280]  really. Right. Uh, and I mean, you know, but it could just be space, you know, obviously that
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:29.360]  thing is, you know, it's like three sheets of paper thick. Yeah. So, but I, I don't know,
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:36.880]  I was a little surprised that it didn't have it. I same way. I would guess that promotion is coming
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:42.640]  to the iPhone this year. Right? Like I shot my mouth off about true tone coming to the iPhone,
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:48.320]  but that makes sense because true tone requires sensors to sense the ambient light and sensors
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.640]  take up space and the phone doesn't have space to spare. I mean, they, I don't know if you heard,
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:55.920]  but they even took it. Nobody noticed, but last year they took out the headphone Jack.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.880]  Uh, they took out the headphone Jack on the iPhone because they did, they needed the space.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:08.640]  So the fact is anybody told, has anybody told the verge? I don't think so. Someone should call the
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.480]  verge. Uh, so I would expect, but I would expect, uh, cause I think all you need for promotion is
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:20.640]  you need the software support in iOS and you need a really super fast GPU and they've already done
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:27.920]  the work in iOS obviously. And, uh, the GPU I would guess is not going to, you know, I would
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.840]  guess that the iPhone is going to have a nice GPU. So I would hope that it has this, uh, promotion,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.880]  but it seems like they've, they've, they've got a few technologies floating out there
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.240]  that are on certain devices, but not, I mean like 3d touch is not on the iPads either.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:48.960]  Right. Right. I wonder about 3d touch. I wonder, I don't know. I feel like it.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.680]  That's a, that's a feature that I, I just don't, I still don't know if I like it.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:32:01.600]  I mean, I only had it for a little while. Well, six, seven months, something like that. Um,
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.000]  until the SE came out, um, and I liked it. I think using it in, in tweetbot was the,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:14.880]  was probably the single biggest, because you could look, you could just 3d touch on a tweet and see
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:23.520]  the, um, the thread basically, you know, replies and stuff like that. So I use that a lot. Um,
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.200]  but I didn't use it that much. I mean, it was, and it was early, but I didn't use it that much,
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.960]  like in springboard to do special things. See, I did. I use tweetbot every day. Tweetbot is
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:39.600]  usually the number one battery usage on my phone. And I say that not as a complaint that tweetbot
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.840]  is an abnormal battery hog, but it's just, it's the most, it's the app where you spend your time.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.880]  I spend by far the most time on tweetbot. I did not know I could 3d touch on a tweet,
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:54.720]  but I don't like it. I don't think I like it as much as swiping from right to left. I get the
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:01.360]  same view if I swipe right to left and it feels faster to me. I feel like, well, I don't know. I
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.240]  just, I liked it cause I could do it and then I could release and it's, that was a little easier
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:11.280]  than going back. But right. Um, does your iPhone SE have a real button or home button or a virtual
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.800]  home button? Yeah. Real buttons. I mean, it's basically other than the, uh, you know, the chips
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:23.280]  and stuff like that on the inside. It's identical to the 5s. That's where I'm, uh, that's where I'm,
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.680]  I am sold on the haptics. I love that button. I have to say, I liked that button too. I mean,
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.880]  I was perfectly fine. I've only, oh, I guess the 6s did not have that button. Right? No,
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:38.000]  it did start, but, but I have used, I mean, I've used, um, my wife's and my son's seven.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.960]  And I, I'm perfectly fine with that button. Yeah. Uh, totally. So I think, I feel, I just feel like
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.560]  3d touch has to get better and I kind of feel like it needs to be everywhere. Like that's,
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.920]  I think that even to get back to your point, that's kind of how I feel about the touch bar too.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:58.000]  Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, and I feel like the touch bar, honestly, I feel like the touch bar needs
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.880]  3d touch. I want those buttons to click a little bit when I tap them. I don't like that they're
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.880]  inert. Yeah. That would be better. And it just, because it doesn't, they did this thing with a
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.760]  diffuser so that it looks sort of like fake keys. It doesn't look like a bright shiny display. It's
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.760]  not glossy. It has sort of a matte finish and it's diffused a little bit so that the fake keys look
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.760]  like real keys. It's a very nice effect. It just makes it less distracting than it would be if it
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.040]  was like a bright shiny iPhone display going across the top of your keyboard. But it also means
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.960]  to me, like it feels like they should, they should click a little bit. Like I don't like it when I'm
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.920]  using like a microwave oven or something where the, they have these permanent hard, you know,
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.760]  the buttons are painted on the device, but they don't, if they don't give any physical feedback
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.560]  at all, if they just beep or whatever, I find that unpleasant. Yeah. I feel like they should,
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:58.400]  you know, just give me a little feedback, a little click. What else do we have going on?
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.080]  We've got, how about all this Uber crap that's going on? This is me, this is me reading from
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.080]  my notes for the show. All this Uber crap that's going on.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.800]  I, there's part of me, I've linked to a lot of this stuff recently during Fireball and I've been
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.320]  following along and there's part of me is like, why the fuck do we even care about this? I mean,
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.600]  it does, it is sort of, I don't know if we're right to be fascinated by this or are we wasting
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.920]  time? No, I think, I mean, I, I believe that you, you vote with your dollars and so you should,
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.000]  I mean, that's one of the reasons why in general I like playing Apple stuff because I think in,
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.040]  you know, certainly in terms of privacy, I think they care a little bit more about people's
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:47.360]  privacy than everybody else. Um, and if I have options at the very least, I want to use somebody
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:55.200]  who is a better citizen if they're, you know, and I, and I don't want to, I don't want to funnel,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  I mean, I think you, you can see, uh, you feed this sort of toxic machine when you funnel money
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.760]  to these people who are themselves toxic. So I don't want to give Travis Kalanick any more money.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.000]  You, you know, a lot of people who work at Apple, you've met them over the years,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.160]  you know, I'm not saying to a T, you know, it's a big company and they've hired more,
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.200]  but in general, people who work at Apple, in my experience are good people. They're,
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:30.480]  they're just tend to be nice people. Like they're just sort of people who to a person,
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.920]  like if they noticed that you left your wallet behind and they don't even know who you are,
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.160]  they're going to grab it and say, Hey, Hey buddy, you just left your wallet, right? Like they're,
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:42.080]  you know, and you know, the world is full of good people. I think most people are good,
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.240]  but Apple definitely is a company whose culture, uh, is mostly good people. I don't understand how
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:58.000]  an entire company could form such a moral abyss as, as Uber. Again, the one to me and I, the whole
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.800]  thing with the culture of, of sexism, rampant, rampant sexism and, and just, just the absolute
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:12.080]  worst, you know, uh, sexual harassment on the job and, uh, uh, uh, HR system that obviously
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.040]  was just flushing the reports of it right down the fricking toilet. Uh, it's absolutely horrible,
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.200]  but this Kalanick is, you know, like there, there was that guy email, whatever his name is,
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:30.880]  his number two guy and, and that he literally threatened Sarah Lacey, a reporter who's now
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.880]  like the founder of pando, like literally threatened her and said like, why don't you know,
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.680]  and, and was recorded talking to someone and saying, well, I'm, I'm thinking what we should
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.320]  do is hire investigators to look into her to another reporter. And the other reporters like,
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.360]  why are you telling me this? And he goes, well, this is off the record, right? And he's like,
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  no, you don't say that. You just told me this. And so we reported it and they didn't fire the
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.320]  guy. Like how do you not fi how, how, how are you the CEO of this company? Other than the answer
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.200]  being that you yourself are a horrible person, right? Right. Like you say, well, this guy was,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.800]  you know, it's not like he was alleged to have said this. This is actually what he said that
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.520]  we're going to hire investigators to dig dirt on people who write critical articles about Uber.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.640]  Yeah. Look into their personal lives. Yeah. And you say, yeah, that's my number two. I like this
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.440]  guy. I like his style. I like the cut of his, like the cut of his gym. He's gone now though, right?
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.400]  Yeah. Well, they're all, I think that guy is gone and obviously Kalanick is not gone, but,
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:34.240]  um, yeah, I just, I don't, I, I understand that there are some, in some instances, um,
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.400]  and for, for, you know, purposes of safety and a variety of other things, uh, you have to use
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:50.160]  sometimes a service from a company that you might not generally approve of their conduct. Um,
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.720]  but you know, in, in, in instances where I do have a choice and I mean, I will, I mean, I like,
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.720]  so when we were in San Diego, I just, we just used Lyft the whole time. And not that Lyft is a,
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:05.040]  Lyft is not a perfect company either by any stretch of the imagination. However, they seem
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:13.120]  to be objectively better than Uber. Um, and at a certain point you, I think they're, you know,
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.200]  a company can get so bad where you just say, you know what, I cannot use this company at all.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.440]  Yeah. It's, you know, I, anyway, the other thing, I don't want to spend too much time on Uber,
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.640]  but the other thing is I can't, uh, I, I can't, I can't get what their business is. I don't see
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:34.000]  why people think that this, I don't, uh, and yeah, I don't see why there were $70 billion because
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  yes, they did change the world. They, you know, the world's a different place now with these
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.240]  ride sharing services that you can hail and it's really great. And for some people it's, you know,
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.800]  it's even more important than others. You know, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.440]  you know, uh, just because they weren't serviced by taxis. It's not just like, oh, taxis were,
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.040]  uh, uh, unpleasant and now Ubers are pleasant, but there wasn't even taxi service from A to B
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.760]  and now they can get an Uber and they don't have to drive. Um, and surely it's a good thing. It's
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.800]  a tremendous thing for, to keep people with, uh, had a couple of drinks off the road, you know,
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.000]  it's so much easier from so many places, uh, that, that before you were either,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.040]  you either drive yourself and, you know, take a chance, uh, which is a terrible thing to do,
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:21.440]  just to go back to texting and driving, especially if you take a couple of drinks
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.320]  and you're texting while you're driving home. Uh, I mean, I'd say, you know, I've seen stories
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.320]  about it. It has a measured risk, you know, the world's a better place for this, but I don't see
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.920]  how they have a unique competitive advantage. Like as soon as they raise their rates to pay
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.480]  their drivers enough, somebody else is going to undercut them on price. Like it's naturally going
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.720]  to be a commodity type thing. And the technology isn't really that difficult. You know, you just
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.360]  need GPS and maps and you don't have to do the maps yourself. There's API. So you can use the
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.400]  iOS maps or Google maps. Yeah. So I don't see how they're worth money. I mean, I think that's why
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.800]  they were so hell bent on developing their own, uh, self-driving car technology that they would
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.840]  literally hire, hire a guy to steal. I mean, I mean, a lot of these, a lot of these drivers
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:09.360]  drive for both. Right. And if they could, in theory, if they came up with a self-driving car
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.680]  technology, uh, that, that they own the technology to, well, then there's a business because then
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.880]  they're, it makes, you know, obviously it reduces what they pay their drivers to zero. And it's
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.200]  something that they can license to others, but as it stands now, as the app where you say, give me
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.320]  a ride and then your ride shows up, I don't see how that's a $70 billion business. I think that,
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.640]  and I, the other thing too, I don't get is I don't see how they think somebody's going to take the
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.840]  job as CEO, but who the hell? I wouldn't take it because Kalanick is still on the board because
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.760]  they can't really get rid of them because he owns, uh, he owns all the stock and they can't
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.040]  just take a stock away. Yeah. I mean, I,
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.240]  they got Boseman St. John, right. Yeah. Um, from Apple and we still don't know why.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.000]  Yeah. I don't really know why either. Um, I, I have a theory on that now. I don't know.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.880]  So I don't know if they're, but I don't know if they're like actively like trying to go out and
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.200]  say, well, okay, well let's, let's make some, some high profile. Well, somebody, somebody,
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.280]  I did not, I can't prove this. Somebody, somebody on Slack today said that they're apparently,
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.320]  the word is that they're trying to get Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:22.880]  Uh, it would be a fantastic hire for Uber. I can't see why she would prefer right. Being
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:31.600]  number two being number one at Uber, you know, which has a bad, it needs a cleanup and might
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.280]  have a severe fundamental business problem. Why would she leave Facebook for that? But,
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:42.160]  um, you know, who knows? But anyway, but so with Boseman St. John, I, here's my theory
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:49.200]  is that, uh, from Uber's perspective, you could see why they'd want her. Uh, she is obviously a
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:55.360]  very dynamic personality. She's great. Uh, she's black, she's a woman. That's a lot of problems,
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.680]  perception problems that Uber's had is that it's a company run by straight white guys
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:05.040]  who are assholes. Uh, she's obviously, you can just tell, I mean, her, her Twitter handle is
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:12.400]  bad-ass boss. She's not going to take any bullshit. Right. Yeah. Uh, so if, if they're hiring her to
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:17.200]  be the public face of Uber's product marketing and cause I can only imagine she'd leave Uber,
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.320]  you know, that it must've been a very sweet offer. Uh, that's a great hire for them. And I can kind
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:29.360]  of see why she would take it because she could being, uh, like the, the public product marketing
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.920]  face of Uber is way more time than she's ever going to get at Apple. Right. She's one of many
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.040]  product marketing stars within a very large company. Right. So I could see it. I have the
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.440]  people who are totally baffled by that. I actually, and you know, in terms of, wow,
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.720]  it's a rotten culture in there. I salute her if she's going in there to say, I can help fix this
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.880]  or, you know, like, I don't think she's going in there. I would be shocked. I'd never met her,
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.000]  but I would be absolutely shocked from what I know of her, that she was going in there and saying,
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.520]  well, you know, I guess, I mean, like as someone who was never like, I've never been in a position,
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:10.640]  um, I've never been in a position of power in an organization. Not really. I mean,
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.720]  like a brief, like I was a manager for a small, small amount of time, but, um,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.440]  and so just like, to me, like the idea of going to work someplace that's so toxic just seems like,
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:26.320]  Oh, forget that. Yeah. I, I would only, yeah, I'm, I don't feel like my personality is such
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.120]  that I come in and change a culture. I, I want to go somewhere and fit in and feel like this
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:35.040]  is a culture that I support, but yeah, that's like, I think about places like where I would
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:40.160]  like to go to work, you know, like it's, it's people that I know, like, like panic or, you
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.960]  know, like somebody that I know who I like, it'd be great to go work there. Right. But yeah,
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:48.320]  I'm going to work for a bunch of dicks. It doesn't seem like a good time.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.960]  What else do we got here? Do you have a Nintendo switch?
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.840]  That's a sore spot. No, I do not have a Nintendo switch. I've screwed it up. I've screwed it up
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.160]  like twice now and I don't have one. Nintendo came out today and an interview with ours and
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.360]  said they are not purposefully under, you know, under, under producing. Yeah. Well, I mean,
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:13.840]  I had heard that like, I mean, the rumor was that Apple is scooping up all the chips and they can't
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:19.280]  get any, don't you think I saw that story. Don't you think that that's just a typical way to put
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.080]  Apple in the headline because all the actual article, they weren't literally saying Apple
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.120]  in particular, they were saying that they're one of, you know, that there are components that all
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:34.720]  of these devices use, you know, like Ram chips and stuff like that. And bigger companies like Apple
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.160]  and Samsung get to the head of the line. Yeah. I mean, you know, if anything, it, if you wanted
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.640]  to be fair, it should have been Apple and Samsung because they are the two gorillas. Nobody wants it
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.360]  to be in terms of you just, you know, like you, you're waiting in line for the movie,
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.000]  the movie does to sell you a ticket and Apple shows up and just says, we're going to buy all
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.040]  the tickets. Well, you know, kind of sucks, but that's, you know, that's what happens when you're
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.360]  buying 70 million, they're making 70 million iPhones a year. So we got to switch a couple,
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.840]  a bit ago, a friend of the show, Matthew Panzerino hooked me up. He texted me the one day he was in
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:13.360]  Target and he's like, Oh my God, they've got switches on the shelf. Do you want me to get
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:20.080]  you one? I was like, yes, yes. Get me one and send it. Oh no. What happened? I got to talk to him.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.240]  What happened first was he texted me like the week before and said, Amazon just got a,
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.520]  he knows I want one. And he said, Amazon just got a shipment of switches. And I went there and they
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.800]  had them. And you, you're on the Slack with me. I was, I dicked around on the Slack. That's what I
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:38.320]  did. I dicked around. I waited like an hour thinking about it. And then they're all gone.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.240]  Yeah. I was trying to figure out like, do I want one pro controller or two? And then I was like,
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.920]  I guess I'll just get one to start. And if we like it, we'll get another one. And I got,
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.840]  and they're all gone. I was like, ah, John, dumb shit. So the next time I didn't hesitate. Anyway,
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:58.000]  I got one. Here's my one word review. It's very fun. And I like it. And it has a very,
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.040]  very nice onboarding. Like setting it up was very nice. Okay. But I haven't really played enough.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.960]  And the other problem I have, uh, you might appreciate this. I'm having problems getting
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.040]  Jonas to play with me because we only really have two games. We've got the Zelda and we got the
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:16.320]  Mario cart and I'm not interested in the Zelda. Maybe someday I'll, uh, if I get sick or something,
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.160]  I'll spend the day with it or whatever. But Jonas seems to like it. But with the Mario cart,
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.880]  the problem is, is that I I'm still good enough at Mario cart where I beat Jonas. And now he,
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:30.880]  now he won't play with me. Hmm. Yeah. He won't play with you at all, huh? He doesn't play Mario
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.480]  cart in a long time, but we, uh, we play a lot of other things. Um, and he, he's getting to the
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:41.520]  point where he can beat me at a few things and he's beaten me at Mario cart a few times. Now
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:51.120]  I still, I still usually win, but, uh, we he's getting there. We had a game for the, uh, the Wii
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:58.240]  U, which was, you know, lamented purchase of overall, but we had a James Bond game. I think
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.720]  it was called GoldenEye, but it wasn't the old classic N64. It wasn't like a remake. It's just,
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.640]  you know, they just made a new James Bond first person shooter, but it had a mode like the old
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:12.560]  N64 one, uh, where you could do a split screen. And so to me and Jonas playing side by side could
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.160]  play each other. I couldn't even get a shot on him. I mean, he just kept blowing my head off
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:22.960]  and he was just, I was trying my best and I used to be really good at the N64 version of that game.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:29.200]  I used to be really good at it. Uh, I just couldn't, I've lost my, my, my reflexes are lower.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.840]  I don't really, I don't play any first person shooters. So that's why you shouldn't be flipping
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:41.040]  any babies. And I, I mean, like to say that he wiped me out was, is an overstatement and then
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:49.040]  he'd start like gloating and purposefully using shitty guns. You know, like I've got like some
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.440]  kind of, you know, monster Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, rack mounted, you know, uh, machine gun.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.560]  You've got the, you've got the rail gun and he's these with it. He's got a pistol. He's got like
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.200]  a revolver on purpose and he'll like shoot a couple off. He'll like, Hey, I'll empty half the clip.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.840]  And it's like, Oh, come on. But now he won't play Mario Kart because I've come in first and he comes
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.560]  in second. It makes me mad. And what he does is he sort of, what he started doing like last week
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.840]  is sort of passive aggressively, like not even trying like any to come in 12th. And it's like,
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.240]  come on, at least give me a fight. We've got, we have a, uh, like a classic, like a used game place
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.280]  over at the mall. Um, and, uh, and now Hank is like in love with this place. Like he, so we go
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.480]  over there and we get old games and he got, uh, I think it's the force unleashed, um, for, I think
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.800]  it was, yes, for the, yes, for the Wii U, um, or for the Wii, maybe it would, you might've been
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.880]  before, but, um, he played, so he got that and he played it for a little while and, you know,
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.080]  and then he wanted to play me. And so he was, he was killing me and then I started getting better.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.560]  And then, and then sure enough, he was, yeah, he hasn't asked me to play in a little while,
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:59.280]  but he's still, I think he's still better at it than I am. And, uh, but, but that's the kind of,
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.720]  I think that's the kind of one that I would, I would pick up fairly quickly on a, uh,
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.560]  and again, I'm not a serious gamer. Jonas is, but Jonas, you know, he has a PlayStation and he,
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:14.560]  you know, very serious about it. Uh, he, he acknowledges that the, the switch graphics are
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.040]  fine, you know, and for rendering Nintendo style games, it's terrific. I thought even the Wii U
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.320]  looked sorta, and I don't know, maybe it's even like the same technology. Maybe it's not even that
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:31.200]  much better of a platform than the Wii U, but there's something about it that feels better to
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.560]  me. Yeah, it's packaged much better. Yeah. And the responsiveness on the little handheld screen is
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.720]  terrific. Whereas that the, the one that came with the Wii U man, that thing was a turd. Yeah,
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:45.760]  no, it's not. It's no good. Yeah. So it's good to see Nintendo having it back. Yeah, definitely
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.480]  back on their game. That's my, yeah. And I, you know, I am, I am, I have alerts set up
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.120]  waiting to get, and you can buy like game stuff has like packages that you could buy,
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.680]  but none of the packages were ones that I really wanted. Yeah. And it's like, cause I would like,
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.160]  yeah, I mean like breath of the wild and, um, Mario Kart would be the two ones that I would
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:10.320]  really want. And these were ones that I didn't even, it's like, you know, the grocery, you know,
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.320]  like, so, so, you know, so basically there's something like it's, you have to pay 400 bucks,
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:22.640]  um, but you do get a couple extra things. Yeah. Uh, I think that's about it. I got to get going,
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:27.920]  uh, unless there's anything important that you think that, uh, we didn't talk about, uh, Chris
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.040]  Lattner left Tesla. Oh yeah. That's right. We, we, we were, did not discuss that. Yeah. That's
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:37.920]  a weird one. So Chris Lattner was an inventor of the Swift programming language and all sorts of
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:44.720]  other developer technology at Apple. And, uh, in a somewhat surprised, I think a lot of people left
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:54.640]  in January to become the, to head up Tesla's self-driving software, uh, uh, group. And like
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:00.400]  two days ago abruptly left the company. Uh, I don't know what the heck went on. Well,
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.600]  I guess that's the other thing about, you know, like when you're in that level of position,
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.600]  if you probably learn pretty, you probably learn pretty quickly if things are working out or not,
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.280]  like, or if it's what you know, what you want, I'm worried for him because I feel like with
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:21.360]  his meager resume, he's going to have a hard time getting another job. He's only got seven
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:25.920]  years on Swift, his resume, a lot of jokes about that recently.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:34.640]  His resume, if you just look at it, looks like the combined resume for like the Stanford computer
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:40.400]  science department's faculty. Like if you were like a kid going, you know, like a hotshot kid
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.960]  with a high SAT score and you want to go study comp sci and you go looking at Stanford and you're
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:49.440]  like, well, what's the faculty done? And their joint accomplishments were Chris Lattner's.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.000]  You'd be like, Oh, that seems like a pretty good school. Yeah. I feel like he should.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.840]  I like how it's formatted. Like it's using that or something.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.000]  Oh, I love it. I love it. It's totally old school.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.200]  Million years old. I think it's like, she doesn't get like,
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:07.760]  if you want me, you know, you want me. I think that it's, I think it's formatted as
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:11.680]  that's what HTML looks like. If you don't use any CSS, it's just like the default, you know,
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.120]  which I kind of love. Yeah, definitely.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.680]  Yeah. So anyway, good luck to him. I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:23.040]  Best wishes, thoughts and prayers. All right.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.520]  I hope he lands on his feet. I've got to run. Okay.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.080]  Thank you, John, for joining. Thank you.
