[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  Don't know it's feel like it's been like a weird news cycle and I feel like this show is gonna be chock-full of complaints
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.720]  about Apple products
[00:07.920 --> 00:15.320]  It's uh, yeah, I don't know if it's complaints so much as problems that would be solved and haven't been yet
[00:18.800 --> 00:21.600]  Well, let's start with a good one here's here and and I
[00:22.280 --> 00:26.960]  Really like this piece because I felt like it's the sort of thing that people just don't bring up
[00:26.960 --> 00:34.120]  And it's a piece you wrote an update of a two-year-old piece that you published last week on the basic gist of it is
[00:35.680 --> 00:43.540]  How come all every other smartwatch other than Apple watch doesn't really have a smaller size that fits smaller wrists like
[00:43.760 --> 00:51.280]  for example the wrists on an awful lot of women and I I say that because I don't I think Apple very
[00:51.280 --> 00:57.360]  Deliberately does not call the 42 millimeter the men's watch and 38 millimeter the women's watch because
[00:59.360 --> 01:01.360]  It just I
[01:01.360 --> 01:07.080]  Don't I don't think it's like even like political correctness or something like that or trying to there's just no point for it, right?
[01:07.720 --> 01:14.440]  because there's no reason to there there are men who wear the 38 millimeter because they have smaller wrists and and there are
[01:14.720 --> 01:21.200]  Surely women who wear the 42 millimeter because their wrists either their their wrists are bigger or they want the extra battery life
[01:21.200 --> 01:23.200]  or whatever
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.680]  But let's face it for most women the 38 millimeter is a more comfortable size
[01:30.720 --> 01:32.720]  Yeah, absolutely
[01:32.840 --> 01:41.240]  And you know, I mean, what is the market out there for other non Apple smartwatches and watch like fitness bands for those sizes?
[01:42.680 --> 01:44.080]  And it's really non-existent
[01:44.080 --> 01:50.960]  that's the that's the frustrating thing is I actually I I'm not against Android wear as a platform and as a
[01:51.440 --> 01:54.540]  Software because I think they're actually doing some really interesting things there
[01:55.080 --> 02:02.880]  And even Fitbit it's doing some interesting things on the software side, but there's just nothing there. There's literally nothing
[02:03.640 --> 02:09.680]  the closest you can get if you want a small quote-unquote smartwatch as a woman is to get one of the
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.440]  big smartwatch manufacturers big watch manufacturers like
[02:15.200 --> 02:19.840]  Connected fitness device like fossil just released one of these that's 36 millimeters round
[02:20.360 --> 02:23.160]  But it's it's literally it's a watch with a step tracker
[02:23.440 --> 02:27.500]  Like it's it's it's a watch with a step tracker and it buzzes if you get a text message
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.040]  It doesn't actually it's not a smartwatch. I would not call that a smartwatch
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.440]  I would call that a an analog watch that occasionally talks to your phone
[02:35.440 --> 02:41.160]  Does it have but everything does it have a digital display or an analog display? No, it's an analog display
[02:41.800 --> 02:45.400]  Well, I mean, I'm not laughing at it, but it is, you know, it's I
[02:46.320 --> 02:51.420]  don't know it it wouldn't do me much good to just get a buzz knowing that I have a
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.880]  Text because my phone is going to buzz in my pocket if I have a text
[02:55.760 --> 03:02.920]  Exactly, and I I mean the main reason like if I was to break down the reasons why I wear a smartwatch as opposed to
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.800]  And let's be honest. No watch. I haven't worn a wash in 12 years before I put the Apple watch back on
[03:08.800 --> 03:09.560]  You know on my wrist
[03:09.560 --> 03:15.680]  I wear a smartwatch a because the time is it's it's a faster way to check the time than pulling out my phone
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.860]  B I want the health tracking and the real health tracking not just step tracking step tracking is not useful to me
[03:22.920 --> 03:30.080]  But heart rate tracking as a as an athlete and as somebody who's actively training right now is exceedingly helpful for me
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.160]  and the the third big one honestly is the the
[03:36.520 --> 03:39.920]  Contextual notifications like I'm sure you do as well
[03:39.920 --> 03:40.480]  You know
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.480]  I I have a lot of different groups of people that I get
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.720]  notifications from and messages from including people from my work and my family and
[03:50.680 --> 03:54.280]  Friends and my roller derby content, you know compatriots and everything else
[03:54.280 --> 04:02.280]  And if I had notifications on for all of those for my phone, my phone basically buzzes once every 45 seconds
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.800]  You know, there's it's a lot
[04:03.800 --> 04:11.160]  There's a lot of stuff going on and what the Apple watch does that I really appreciate is that a it'll only buzz me for
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.400]  The things I want it to buzz and B if it buzzes me for something, you know
[04:15.400 --> 04:17.280]  Like I have Renee on my VIPs, right?
[04:17.280 --> 04:20.040]  So Renee is gonna come through whether or not I have do not disturb on
[04:20.040 --> 04:26.400]  And if I look and it's like on the screen, it's like Renee is talking about the latest episode of arrow
[04:26.400 --> 04:32.040]  I know that I don't necessarily have to leave my dinner conversation and reply immediately to Renee about arrow
[04:32.280 --> 04:34.280]  however, if I check my watch and then it's like
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.800]  So Apple just bought Google, you know, that's that's a little bit different
[04:40.800 --> 04:46.960]  So the VIP feature, I don't know if I'm familiar with that. So that's is that the same VIP feature as with
[04:46.960 --> 04:54.520]  Mail alerts. Is it the same VIP? Well, yeah, I guess it's yeah, I guess it's VIP for messages
[04:55.120 --> 04:57.120]  It's not some
[04:57.120 --> 05:02.560]  Hold on. I'm I'm definitely messing this up because I VIP for messages doesn't actually exist, right?
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.320]  But I have it set up. So how do I how do I have this set up?
[05:06.360 --> 05:10.200]  So then you've now you've got me questioning myself. I'm like, did I just make up a feature?
[05:12.440 --> 05:14.440]  No, I I
[05:14.440 --> 05:20.080]  I don't know now. I'm now I'm really confused. I'm looking at do not disturb. Hold on a second. Do not
[05:21.800 --> 05:28.320]  Do not just Oh favorites favorites, that's what I'm thinking of. Okay, allow phone calls from favorites. Yeah
[05:29.440 --> 05:34.260]  All right, that's that's what I'm thinking about. Well, that makes sense though, but yeah
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.360]  Yeah, but it's still I mean then and on that note
[05:37.360 --> 05:43.320]  I would love for Apple to create a proper VIP feature for messages and other things because it that would be very helpful
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.840]  But it's still yeah, I think now I now I remember what I did
[05:48.840 --> 05:49.200]  Okay
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.020]  So I have do not disturb I have like the snooze feature on a bunch of my messages
[05:54.280 --> 06:01.560]  So that the the new bubbles show up when people text me, but I don't actually get like the banner notification
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.160]  because
[06:03.160 --> 06:05.600]  you know just again if I have a
[06:05.720 --> 06:10.920]  couple of different roller derby chats from people who I'm like skating with right now and Team Canada and everything else and
[06:10.920 --> 06:17.080]  a lot of those just I don't want to say that they're full of nonsense because it's not it's just you know
[06:17.160 --> 06:22.480]  It's we have fun and we chat about you know, sometimes inane things sometimes important things
[06:22.600 --> 06:26.200]  But it's not something that I need to get buzzed at about every 45 seconds
[06:26.200 --> 06:29.480]  I have a lot of those on a group chat can really get active
[06:29.480 --> 06:34.420]  I mean, it's yes just the nature whether it's you know in slack or an iMessage or whatever
[06:35.280 --> 06:36.680]  and
[06:36.680 --> 06:38.680]  You know, it's an interesting. I
[06:38.680 --> 06:46.440]  I don't know comes it the rise of group chats is is an interesting thing because it's different than like
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.900]  Mailing lists when mail was more, you know, the only real way for a group to communicate
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.480]  Because it's chatty right? It's little one-sentence things and emoji in real time
[06:57.480 --> 07:02.640]  Yeah, and it's so many stickers and the weird thing about it is like
[07:02.640 --> 07:09.580]  Yeah, I mean just I mean this is really really gonna date me but like to go all the way back to like the BB
[07:09.580 --> 07:11.580]  I mean to go back to the BBS era
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.680]  you know
[07:13.680 --> 07:19.760]  That that's what you know group chat is exactly what was going on in in like a forum
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.360]  or you know like
[07:22.880 --> 07:24.120]  IRC
[07:24.120 --> 07:25.240]  but
[07:25.240 --> 07:31.980]  IRC is in BBS chats and things like that are things that like you're either in it right now
[07:31.980 --> 07:37.700]  With your you know signed in and looking at it and active or if you're doing something else, you know
[07:37.700 --> 07:43.720]  If you're having this happens without you, right? It just happens without you. Whereas the difference with group chat today is
[07:44.340 --> 07:47.820]  Your phone can still be going off, you know, bing bing bing bing bing
[07:49.220 --> 07:54.900]  You're always you're always on you're always paying attention even if you don't want to be right
[07:56.700 --> 08:00.300]  So managing that is you know, I don't know
[08:00.300 --> 08:07.300]  It's a challenge. It is and I don't think that we've quite licked it yet. You know, I feel like we it should be easier
[08:07.300 --> 08:10.700]  I know slack has a feature where you can say like snooze for X
[08:11.260 --> 08:15.380]  But I feel like it's too hard to get to like you have to like oh you have to open the app
[08:15.380 --> 08:16.820]  You have to go over to the sidebar
[08:16.820 --> 08:20.680]  Like I feel like there ought to be a way that you could do that right from notification center
[08:21.460 --> 08:27.340]  Yeah, exactly. Just have the button that's just like snooze for an hour right slide man. I would love that for messages. Yeah
[08:27.340 --> 08:32.180]  I guess slide to snooze. Well, just slide it over and one of those buttons there
[08:32.180 --> 08:35.660]  it would be you know snooze and you know, maybe you could like
[08:37.380 --> 08:42.140]  3d touch on the snooze button and get a list of how long to snooze it for but then you you know
[08:42.140 --> 08:47.740]  Yeah, one slide one hard press and a and then one more tap and you're done
[08:49.060 --> 08:54.660]  Honestly anything that allows me to not open an app when I don't want to be in that app is a good feature
[08:54.900 --> 08:56.900]  Yeah, I totally agree
[08:56.900 --> 08:58.140]  I
[08:58.140 --> 09:00.140]  anyway smartwatch sizes, so
[09:00.740 --> 09:02.300]  Yeah
[09:02.300 --> 09:09.700]  Going back to that, right? I also think it's true. I I think that even the Apple watch 42 millimeter is
[09:10.820 --> 09:14.840]  Surprisingly small maybe not surprisingly small but but competitively
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.140]  It's smaller than a lot of the other smartwatches that are out there
[09:19.980 --> 09:23.860]  Without question. I mean if you look at in that article that you referenced
[09:23.860 --> 09:27.740]  I have a chart of I went and talked to the Android central guys and I was like, alright
[09:27.740 --> 09:33.220]  What are the biggest like Android wear and other associated smartwatches that are on the market today?
[09:33.740 --> 09:38.920]  And by big I mean like well-sold not physically big but it turns out that the same thing
[09:39.460 --> 09:44.520]  Because literally no Android smartwatch is smaller than 42 millimeter
[09:44.520 --> 09:51.540]  And in fact some are much bigger than 42 millimeter and that's the that's the thing is a in part that's because of the round
[09:51.540 --> 09:57.220]  Wrists the round face that they've decided to go with if you want to do a round face
[09:57.220 --> 09:59.700]  You have to have it be a certain diameter
[10:00.340 --> 10:06.900]  just a to make the the interface readable and be quite honestly because you want to make sure that
[10:08.140 --> 10:10.740]  That you can fit all the components in there
[10:11.180 --> 10:16.100]  So by nature, you know, if you have something that's 30, you know, that's 42 millimeters tall
[10:16.100 --> 10:23.380]  The width is also going to be 42 millimeters and 42 millimeters tall and 42 millimeters wide is a
[10:23.780 --> 10:31.180]  or it's a it's a very different look than 42 millimeters tall and I forget what the Apple watch is off the top of my
[10:31.180 --> 10:33.180]  head, but I think it's like
[10:33.900 --> 10:40.300]  33 millimeters wide something like that something I'll have to look at it. Yeah, but it but it's still it's it. Yeah, you're right
[10:40.300 --> 10:42.020]  It's significantly smaller
[10:42.020 --> 10:44.340]  yeah, as I as somebody who's a
[10:44.340 --> 10:45.660]  a
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.260]  Minor league very, you know, I don't have the addiction too bad, but a watch guy
[10:50.140 --> 10:56.900]  There's a rough for traditional watches. Well, you know, we're talking mechanical round watches. We're we're most around
[10:57.460 --> 11:02.660]  as a rough measure 40 millimeters for a round watch is
[11:03.340 --> 11:06.620]  is and that's measured like side to side is
[11:07.660 --> 11:12.440]  About I think it's fair to say that's quote unquote normal and something
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.920]  Mm-hmm for a man's watch and so like a 36 millimeter men's watch would be considered small
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.920]  Which is how a lot of watches like vintage watches from?
[11:22.680 --> 11:29.880]  30 40 50 years ago that you know watches actually have gotten larger just as a measure of style, you know, it's obvious. Yeah
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.280]  It is a stylish thing people like larger slightly larger watches, especially
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.900]  There was a fad and I think I thankfully because I did not like this fad at all
[11:39.900 --> 11:42.400]  But I would say in the last 10 years
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.020]  There was a fad in men's mechanical watches to get really big and chunky like 45 46 millimeter watches
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.520]  Which I just found just tasteful and
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.040]  Thankfully that seems to be coming to an end, but that's just you know a rough measure
[11:59.040 --> 12:03.240]  but the other thing that you learn when you're you get into watches and
[12:04.600 --> 12:06.920]  it's hard to just take the size and
[12:06.920 --> 12:13.920]  and you know the and look at the marketing pictures and and truly judge whether it's going to
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.800]  look good or bad on your wrist like you really do you really do have to try it on and
[12:20.160 --> 12:23.320]  Sometimes there's a watch that you would think well, that's not too big for me
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.160]  that would be fine and you go try it on and it like either it like sticks up too far or
[12:28.960 --> 12:33.200]  It it's just hard to say and then sometimes there's a watch where you think I have 42 millimeters
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.480]  That's that's too big for me and you try it on and it just works. It's like wow, that's not too big
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.560]  but one of the factors that plays into it are
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.720]  The lugs meaning and yes traditional watches, you know
[12:46.720 --> 12:53.000]  The strap attaches to these lugs that stick up above and below the case and one of the reasons I think the Apple watch
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.280]  Fits so well on so many people and it's so small is that the clever way that the straps attach?
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.760]  Don't have lugs at all. Like so there is no there is no like lug penalty, you know
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.040]  Like the actual 42 millimeters or 38 millimeters, you know
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.280]  Top to bottom of the watch is literally all there is and the strap just starts immediately
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.200]  It's like so I yeah, it's I think the Apple watch gains a couple of millimeters in size because of that
[13:21.640 --> 13:25.680]  Absolutely, and I'm thinking about like I'm wearing the the sport loop right now
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.120]  and that's that in the Milanese are really the only ones and I guess the leather loop are the only ones that even have like an
[13:32.080 --> 13:38.480]  Inkling of a lug because they have that fold over strap, but you're absolutely right. It just kind of starts right there
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.680]  And in comparison, actually, it's as funny when I was looking at all the different the different smart watches
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.740]  Of course Fitbit just recently came out with the ionic
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.040]  And I don't know if you saw their measurements on their site are so
[13:54.040 --> 14:01.280]  Horribly misleading because they only show the measurements. They only show the screen size measurement
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.600]  So they're like look our screen size is only 21 millimeters long
[14:06.240 --> 14:13.280]  And what they're doing is conveniently leaving out the giant lug attachments that connect the band
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  Which make the height?
[14:16.520 --> 14:18.600]  44 point four five millimeters
[14:18.600 --> 14:26.080]  So it's like it's it's stuff like that where you know, I don't want to say that everybody's doing misleading advertising here
[14:26.080 --> 14:32.920]  But but it's it's really bothersome to me to to see how smartwatch manufacturers are
[14:33.720 --> 14:39.880]  At this point, they're like we can't make it smaller for whatever for whatever reason where we've decided not to make this smaller
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.200]  But we're still going to pretend that we can compete with the Apple watch on size
[14:44.200 --> 14:50.560]  so look at how look at how thin and svelte our our screen is never mind the
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.060]  20 millimeters of lugs that we've attached to it
[14:54.120 --> 15:00.240]  Yeah, it's and I'm rooting for Fitbit because I me too. I like the idea, you know
[15:00.240 --> 15:06.840]  And it's the same way the same reason I really was rooting, you know, ten years ago for palm for the the web OS
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  They're you know, they're smartphones to take off
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.080]  you know, I like the idea of upstart companies and I I
[15:15.960 --> 15:23.440]  Don't think it's healthy to have a world where only companies the size of Apple and Google can get a
[15:24.560 --> 15:31.880]  Platform off the ground like yeah, but I understand why that's you know, it's that's why that's the most likely scenario
[15:31.880 --> 15:39.080]  It but you're right I think for a watch you can't you know, like we so we sell laptops by
[15:39.880 --> 15:47.720]  Edge to edge or diagonal screen size, right? Like you don't buy a new MacBook. You don't buy it based on the
[15:48.360 --> 15:50.880]  They'll give you the measurements on the text specs page
[15:50.880 --> 15:58.680]  But when they say it's a 13 inch MacBook Pro, that means that the screen goes 13 inches diagonal to diagonal and that's fine
[15:58.680 --> 16:06.320]  For a laptop that gives you a sense of what you know, it's a fair measurement of how big a laptop is
[16:07.560 --> 16:09.760]  So like with the 11 inch MacBook Air
[16:11.040 --> 16:18.500]  You know, I don't think anybody who has a sense, you know, whose baseline is 13 inches the 11 inch MacBook Air was like
[16:18.560 --> 16:22.520]  Yeah, this is exactly how much smaller it is. Isn't this thing adorable? It's tiny. I
[16:23.560 --> 16:26.400]  Don't think with a watch. That's that's just not
[16:26.400 --> 16:28.200]  It
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.480]  Doesn't quite work. Well again, it comes back to bezels too, right where laptops at this point
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.560]  Their bezels are almost non-existent like they have some but it's you know, when you say it's a 13 inch screen
[16:38.560 --> 16:41.980]  It's really like a thirteen point like two five inch casing
[16:42.400 --> 16:44.400]  It's not really that much bigger
[16:44.640 --> 16:46.780]  But then when you look at a watch
[16:47.400 --> 16:54.400]  You know the the difference between the diameter of the digital display and the diameter of the watch are going to be vastly different
[16:54.400 --> 17:00.420]  In some cases and then again, I go back to the ionic which actually has a widescreen display
[17:00.640 --> 17:05.840]  So despite the fact that it's showing it's like oh our display is 21 millimeters tall
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.400]  and 35 point, you know, 35.99 millimeters
[17:11.040 --> 17:15.160]  Diagonally, but the actual picture is cut off in black bars
[17:15.160 --> 17:21.000]  So it's even thinner than that and they don't say oh this is how big our our display is
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.480]  And it's the same thing with some of the round watches too. It's like you you don't really know how big the like
[17:26.480 --> 17:28.440]  Is there going to be a bezel? Is it going to be edge to edge?
[17:28.440 --> 17:30.440]  like some of them are edge to edge, but I
[17:30.680 --> 17:32.680]  don't know it's just
[17:32.680 --> 17:36.680]  Like when I look at the when I look at the chart that I put up together or to put up
[17:36.680 --> 17:42.220]  It's it's kind of astounding like if you compare it against the the 42 millimeter Apple watch
[17:42.560 --> 17:49.280]  You know the lightest 42 millimeter Apple watch the series one is 30 grams and that's about on par with like the ionic and the gear
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.280]  s2 and the rest of them are much heavier and then the
[17:53.920 --> 17:55.960]  like the sizing 42 millimeters
[17:56.880 --> 18:04.080]  The gear s2 is 39 millimeters tall, but the rest of them are around 42 to 48 basically
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.560]  But then you go to width and it's like 36 millimeters for the 40 for the 42 millimeters
[18:09.560 --> 18:15.480]  And there's no one that even touches that 36 millimeters wide the closest is the ionic at 38
[18:15.480 --> 18:21.400]  And then it jumps up to the 43.6. Which is the gear the the gear s2
[18:21.920 --> 18:29.000]  And that's just the 42 millimeter. You know and you jump down to the 38 millimeter the 38 millimeter is only 33 millimeters wide
[18:29.840 --> 18:31.320]  so
[18:31.320 --> 18:33.320]  Literally the next largest
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.880]  Smart watch after the 38 millimeter is the 42 millimeter. There's no Android wear. There's no
[18:39.880 --> 18:47.360]  Third-party smartwatch manufacturer that even comes close to that width on a on a smart watch
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.760]  Let alone depth the 38 millimeter series one is only 10.5 millimeters
[18:53.600 --> 18:55.600]  Thin I guess thick
[18:55.800 --> 19:02.440]  And the next the next highest is the style the LG watch style which was 10.8 millimeters
[19:02.800 --> 19:06.920]  But that thing was like a behemoth at 42 by 45 millimeters
[19:06.920 --> 19:11.760]  Like it was a it was a giant black hole on your wrist and almost 50 grams heavy
[19:11.760 --> 19:18.780]  it's just and that was that was the mark the watch that was supposedly gonna take over the women's market like the
[19:19.240 --> 19:23.400]  LG watch style at the beginning of the year was like oh, this is the Android watch for women
[19:23.400 --> 19:29.320]  This is the Android watch that women have been waiting for and literally six seven months later. It's been discounted
[19:29.960 --> 19:32.240]  So heavily that like you can buy it for a hundred bucks
[19:32.880 --> 19:34.760]  $250 watch and
[19:34.760 --> 19:40.280]  You know again, I I don't I don't know that they've called it a woman's watch
[19:40.280 --> 19:47.760]  But just from the color choices they used alone. They were in a palette. That was I think a little bit
[19:49.220 --> 19:52.120]  Feminine it was clearly meant to be only had
[19:52.960 --> 19:57.640]  They only had women female models wearing it, right? So it's which is another yeah
[19:57.640 --> 20:02.720]  I would say even more so than an Apple watch, although there are obviously some varieties of Apple watch
[20:02.720 --> 20:07.640]  You know that are clearly meant for women, you know, like the the Hermes models, you know
[20:07.640 --> 20:15.160]  And and some of the double tour absolutely and some of the band choices even from Apple some of the sort of I forget Apple's
[20:15.160 --> 20:19.540]  Fancy color names, but the the ones that are sort of pink sand right pink sand
[20:21.680 --> 20:28.360]  Yeah, but I think it's way too big it's just ridiculously big and I you know, why why is that and I honestly think
[20:28.360 --> 20:30.360]  I think the thing that people don't want to
[20:30.360 --> 20:35.240]  Some people don't want to just talk about like the elephant is the in the room
[20:35.240 --> 20:40.620]  I think is that the obvious answer is that Apple is so far ahead at being able silicon
[20:40.620 --> 20:43.840]  Yeah at that that nobody else can touch them
[20:44.840 --> 20:46.960]  Mm-hmm, and I think that
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.960]  From the point of view of
[20:52.080 --> 20:53.520]  of
[20:53.520 --> 20:59.060]  Of you know, it gets into the whole journalistic argument of are you Pro Apple?
[20:59.060 --> 21:03.520]  Are you in the bag for Apple? Are you biased against Apple that sort of thing?
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.360]  That there are certain a lot of publications that want to try to appeal
[21:08.880 --> 21:15.880]  Appear above the board and sort of even-handed and and not in favor of of any particular company
[21:16.460 --> 21:22.920]  And therefore don't want to touch that because it sounds some people are gonna hear that and and say well
[21:22.920 --> 21:28.120]  You're just in the bag for Apple because there's yeah, but I think that that's the obvious it's not being
[21:28.120 --> 21:33.040]  Biased in favor of Apple. It's stating. It's the Occam's razor explanation
[21:33.760 --> 21:35.620]  Yeah, it's a literal fact
[21:35.620 --> 21:37.000]  There is no you know
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.980]  there is no smartwatch out there that even remotely comes close to this size and the silicon like the
[21:44.200 --> 21:47.680]  the technical challenges for making this happen are
[21:48.280 --> 21:54.600]  immense like it the the fact that I mean and this is the thing that really won me over right because when the 38 millimeter
[21:54.600 --> 21:59.640]  First came out in 2015. It was definitely the subpar of the two watches
[21:59.820 --> 22:03.360]  like it didn't get a full day that worth of battery life and we kind of just
[22:03.600 --> 22:08.040]  Dealt with it because we understood that hey, we're getting this technology in a tiny package
[22:08.160 --> 22:11.780]  But it was death. It was not the same watch as the 42 millimeter
[22:11.780 --> 22:18.040]  And then when the series 2 came out, they made a lot of you know a lot of significant changes
[22:18.040 --> 22:24.280]  To both they put a bigger battery in and they they really made the 38 millimeter stand
[22:24.760 --> 22:29.780]  alongside its big brother as the same watch basically where it didn't really feel like you were getting a
[22:30.320 --> 22:38.160]  Subpar experience if you went for the smaller size and then but the thing that like really stood out to me as this is Apple
[22:39.320 --> 22:46.080]  Basically almost showing off on their silicon expertise is the fact that the 38 millimeter comes in LTE
[22:46.080 --> 22:48.200]  And not only does it come in LTE
[22:48.760 --> 22:52.640]  But it is still just as good as the 42 millimeter at LTE
[22:52.840 --> 22:58.360]  like the battery isn't non-existent if you use the 38 millimeter LTE and
[22:58.720 --> 23:01.320]  I like looking at okay
[23:01.320 --> 23:08.800]  So the 38 millimeter with LTE is the exact same size as the normal series 3. It's just a little bit heavier
[23:08.800 --> 23:10.660]  It's like 2 grams heavier
[23:10.660 --> 23:13.240]  the next like there are other
[23:13.880 --> 23:15.680]  LTE watches and
[23:15.680 --> 23:19.720]  The closest they can get is almost like 45 grams 50 grams
[23:20.360 --> 23:22.840]  and they're all in these big giant casings and
[23:23.800 --> 23:26.360]  that that to me says like
[23:27.040 --> 23:33.000]  Not only did we figure out how to do this. We figured out how to make LTE in a small watch form factor
[23:33.640 --> 23:41.080]  Without killing the battery, but we like we did it. We we actually made this device and sold it
[23:41.080 --> 23:48.520]  to prove that that this is possible and that we're not looking at the small watch as a second-class citizen because it would have
[23:48.520 --> 23:52.560]  Been really it would have been really easy for Apple to just be like well
[23:52.560 --> 23:55.680]  The 38 millimeter is like what you want if you want the basic Apple watch
[23:55.680 --> 23:59.080]  But if you want all the features you want to go 42 like, you know
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.080]  Like the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus and the plus has the better camera
[24:02.600 --> 24:08.360]  And the fact that they didn't the fact that they were able to put all of that technology in the same watch
[24:08.360 --> 24:14.560]  Like that that is a huge deal to me and I don't think people like you're saying
[24:14.560 --> 24:22.520]  I don't think people really the average consumer really gets how big of a win that is for that form factor and that form size
[24:23.240 --> 24:29.480]  And and it you know here it is the third generation and I think the LTE is such a great example of it where?
[24:29.800 --> 24:31.800]  it's not just like
[24:31.800 --> 24:38.360]  go back two years when it was the first generation watch and first generation Android where devices were coming out and
[24:39.400 --> 24:43.360]  It's just going to take the Samsung's and LG's and other
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.960]  You know the other companies making these watches a few years to catch up to get a watch down to that size in
[24:49.040 --> 24:52.400]  The meantime Apple's kept the same size and is added
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.360]  Extra performance way faster CPU starting in the second generation one
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.160]  a faster CPU again in the third one and
[25:04.640 --> 25:10.200]  LTE which is it's just huge and and I also think back to like
[25:10.920 --> 25:12.560]  the
[25:12.560 --> 25:14.560]  2009 2010
[25:14.560 --> 25:15.800]  2011
[25:15.800 --> 25:17.440]  smartphone market
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.440]  And the iPhone was so much smaller than competing phones
[25:22.440 --> 25:27.060]  And I know that we've you know, part of the reason was obviously, you know, it's obvious now
[25:27.060 --> 25:32.700]  That there are people who really want like 5.5 inch phones. Yeah, but
[25:33.340 --> 25:41.020]  Apple's the only company that was and still even now with the iPhone SE that is also making a first-class top-tier
[25:41.940 --> 25:48.140]  Excellent performing smartphone. That's that small. I mean and that's in that package. Yeah
[25:50.340 --> 25:52.660]  And I think like the fact that
[25:52.660 --> 25:59.860]  Like I I see a fair number of iPhone SE's and I guess you know
[25:59.860 --> 26:02.800]  Like if I'm out on the street and I just see somebody who's using an iPhone
[26:02.980 --> 26:09.540]  See, I don't know for sure if it's an SE or and it could just be an old 5s, but I've seen them
[26:09.620 --> 26:14.140]  You know, I you know, I'm just this is what I do. I've said this before in the show. I'm just it
[26:14.940 --> 26:16.820]  Just nosy about the people's phones
[26:16.820 --> 26:22.260]  I just can't help but look I'm just fascinated by it and a lot of the ones I see lately look like they're an
[26:22.260 --> 26:29.800]  excellent condition and I also happen to notice that seems to me like that people who have the iPhone SE are way more likely way
[26:29.800 --> 26:31.800]  way way more likely than
[26:32.300 --> 26:40.060]  people with bigger phones of any make to not use a case like I see uncased iPhone SE's and I think it makes sense because
[26:40.060 --> 26:45.140]  It's so grippable and so much smaller that you don't feel like you need a case. I feel even with the
[26:45.140 --> 26:52.660]  The 4.7 inch iPhone size the iPhone 7 that's 6 the success it just I think a lot of people pick it up
[26:52.660 --> 26:56.460]  and if you know and as soon as that, you know, they buy it they take it out of the case and
[26:56.860 --> 27:00.380]  Box and even if they were thinking maybe I won't use a case they pick it up and they're like
[27:00.380 --> 27:03.860]  I want to get a case for this and I feel like you don't get that feeling with the SE
[27:03.860 --> 27:08.020]  But it's obviously the fact that Apple like was behind when the iPhone SE first came out
[27:08.020 --> 27:12.720]  It took them months to catch up to demand and and they even admitted in a conference call that yes
[27:12.720 --> 27:15.780]  The didn't you know demand for SE took us by surprise, you know
[27:16.780 --> 27:20.500]  There's obviously a market for smaller phones and nobody else is making them
[27:21.180 --> 27:22.680]  yeah, and
[27:22.680 --> 27:30.460]  an Apple was very smart in capitalizing on that and the the interesting thing to me comparing phones to watches to is
[27:30.660 --> 27:35.060]  that phone I phones I feel like the screen size is more of a it's it's a
[27:35.460 --> 27:38.780]  It's more of a practical decision where you're just kind of like yeah
[27:38.780 --> 27:43.860]  I can deal with the added bulk of having a bigger screen or no for my iPhone
[27:43.860 --> 27:45.460]  I don't need to have a big screen
[27:45.460 --> 27:49.560]  I'm not want to watch Netflix on it or I'm not taking a lot of video and I can deal with you know
[27:49.560 --> 27:55.820]  I the SE is perfect for me with a watch. I feel like that decision is less practical and more personal
[27:56.620 --> 28:02.860]  Because here's the thing, you know, like I could I would get more battery life and the the screen size
[28:02.860 --> 28:06.140]  I mean it is definitely for for tappability and
[28:06.140 --> 28:10.820]  Interactivity the 42 millimeter screen size is certainly easier
[28:10.820 --> 28:17.060]  I definitely I have some adjustments on my 38 where I have dynamic type up a little bit and I'm not you know
[28:17.060 --> 28:22.720]  I'm far from blind but it's just it just makes the interface and just interactivity a little bit nicer
[28:23.700 --> 28:24.760]  but
[28:24.760 --> 28:28.940]  When it comes to like the actual casing size, you know the 42 millimeter
[28:29.700 --> 28:34.120]  I've said this before like the 42 millimeter looks like a smartwatch on my wrist
[28:34.120 --> 28:41.060]  Which is to say like it looks the same way that I felt when I was carrying around a Newton in seventh grade
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.840]  Where I loved it and it was super cool technology
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.360]  But it was very obvious that I was using something tech tech related
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.500]  Right is like this is this is not normal the 38 millimeter Apple watch looks like a watch
[28:55.840 --> 29:01.400]  That happens to also be a smartwatch. It doesn't call attention to itself as like hi
[29:01.400 --> 29:05.920]  Look what I've got and in fact, this is like maybe a funny anecdote
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.960]  But there was a while there where I was testing to 38 millimeter Apple watches
[29:10.960 --> 29:16.000]  I was testing the LTE version and the non LTE version and I had one on each wrist and
[29:16.400 --> 29:20.840]  I I went out, you know multiple times with friends and it would take them
[29:21.600 --> 29:27.640]  3045 minutes to realize that I had a watch on both wrists because it's just it kind of just blends in as jewelry
[29:28.320 --> 29:30.320]  and it wasn't until like I
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.240]  I'm moved both hands up at once where someone was like, wait a second. Are you wearing two watches?
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.400]  But that's the thing right? Like if I was wearing
[29:38.920 --> 29:46.160]  Two 45 42 millimeters or heck any any of the Android wear watches like the second you raise your wrist
[29:46.160 --> 29:53.100]  It looks like you have a Star Trek like communicator like soldered on or you have like Wonder Woman's gauntlets, right?
[29:53.360 --> 29:59.260]  You're just like, oh, I've I've got stuff on my wrist and and look at my technology
[29:59.260 --> 30:00.900]  technology
[30:00.900 --> 30:02.900]  Yeah, I don't know. I just it
[30:03.300 --> 30:05.340]  To me it feels bulky
[30:05.340 --> 30:08.100]  It feels weird and then there's the the side part of it
[30:08.300 --> 30:12.100]  Which I I didn't even really get into a ton in in my article
[30:12.100 --> 30:17.980]  But I am really concerned about it which is health tracking like the reason that Apple watch there's I mean
[30:17.980 --> 30:20.300]  There are a lot of reasons why Apple watch is kind of the most
[30:20.820 --> 30:25.720]  Currently according to that Stanford study the most reliable tracker for baseline heart rate
[30:25.720 --> 30:33.080]  But a lot of it I think has to do with the way that the sensors are positioned and the Apple watch sensors are fairly
[30:33.080 --> 30:38.000]  small and fairly discreet and the like the the circle like the
[30:38.480 --> 30:44.040]  Circle what that connects to your your wrist or your your skin is fairly small
[30:44.480 --> 30:48.680]  And it's built in such a way that whether or not you wear the 38 or the 42
[30:49.280 --> 30:55.560]  You're not gonna run the risk of getting a like a reading over the side of your wrist because it's really it's really
[30:55.560 --> 31:00.200]  Positioned right in the center there and I don't think that's true for a lot of the other watches
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.380]  Their sensors are kind of much bigger and much more spaced apart
[31:03.640 --> 31:09.720]  So you can make all the arguments you want about like women want to wear big watches and big watches are in style and all
[31:09.720 --> 31:10.760]  of that
[31:10.760 --> 31:16.320]  But either you have to wear the big watch loosely if you want to really like rock the boyfriend bangle
[31:16.480 --> 31:23.120]  Like watch style or if you wear it tightly the the sensors may not even line up correctly on your wrist
[31:23.120 --> 31:29.040]  so if you're trying to get a good reading you may instead be getting like half skin half like
[31:29.560 --> 31:33.880]  Empty space falling off of your wrist or just not connecting properly with the blood vessels
[31:34.520 --> 31:40.080]  It's just that that to me is one of those like side side issues that comes from
[31:40.820 --> 31:42.680]  Forcing people whose wrists, you know
[31:42.680 --> 31:47.680]  Maybe aren't the right size to wear bigger watches because there's literally nothing else for them. I
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.240]  This is one of those areas where even if Apple
[31:52.240 --> 31:54.240]  it released
[31:54.360 --> 31:59.480]  Sales numbers like we sold, you know, seven million Apple watches last quarter
[31:59.480 --> 32:03.500]  Which they haven't done and probably I suspect are never going to start doing
[32:05.980 --> 32:11.800]  Even if they did I don't think they would break it down by size because even with iPhones they just say here's how many iPhones
[32:11.800 --> 32:17.560]  We sold and here's how much money we made from them. They give an average sale price and so you can kind of
[32:17.560 --> 32:25.200]  give backwards engineer a bit of that, you know from the average sales price because the closer it gets to the higher price
[32:25.880 --> 32:31.760]  Obviously the more of the higher price iPhones they're selling so I don't think they would but boy. I wish that they would because
[32:32.960 --> 32:36.780]  Anecdotally, I think Apple watch is incredibly popular with women
[32:36.780 --> 32:43.240]  I I wouldn't be surprised if there are more 38 millimeter watches being sold in 42. I
[32:43.240 --> 32:50.560]  Mean I see what I would believe that 100% and I really think that that would if there were only a 42 millimeter size
[32:50.560 --> 32:54.520]  I think it would be III think it would be I don't think that would be true
[32:54.520 --> 32:55.920]  I think there'd still be
[32:55.920 --> 33:01.780]  Many women who buy it and wear it, but I don't think I think it would be far fewer than 50%
[33:01.880 --> 33:03.880]  You know, I think it yeah
[33:04.080 --> 33:09.760]  Because I just think it would look like a piece of technology on the wrist as opposed to just looking like a nice digital watch
[33:09.760 --> 33:11.520]  on the wrist
[33:11.520 --> 33:15.440]  Exactly, and I mean you've hit the nail on the head a lot of women, you know
[33:15.440 --> 33:20.200]  And this includes people like my mom and just friends of mine, you know
[33:20.200 --> 33:27.520]  Almost almost all of my roller derby friends who started off wearing other smartwatch trackers or just or fitness trackers
[33:27.520 --> 33:30.800]  Have switched over to getting an Apple watch in part
[33:31.320 --> 33:33.960]  Because they've seen mine but in part because they're like well
[33:33.960 --> 33:36.720]  I don't know if this is gonna look good and then they go in and they try it on
[33:36.720 --> 33:42.560]  and then they find out some of the things that can do and keep in mind like I'm talking a lot about the positive the
[33:42.560 --> 33:46.600]  Positive features of the Apple watch the Apple watch still has problems, you know, it's not perfect
[33:46.600 --> 33:52.000]  The soft third-party apps is a whole different discussion. We can maybe get into it a large later date
[33:52.760 --> 33:55.520]  But they're you know for all of its flaws
[33:55.760 --> 34:03.440]  It does have some really useful features for people on the go and hell like in in Montreal
[34:03.440 --> 34:10.400]  For example, my Apple watch is a I don't even know the word. I'm looking for
[34:10.400 --> 34:15.760]  It's a godsend honestly because everywhere in Montreal is pay pass compatible
[34:15.920 --> 34:22.960]  So I haven't had to pull out and this is doubly important because when you're living in a foreign country and you have an American
[34:22.960 --> 34:25.440]  Card, I don't have a pin on that card
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.560]  So anytime I have to use the physical card
[34:27.560 --> 34:29.160]  I have to sign for it
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.520]  Which is something that isn't done because everybody else here has pins. So they just look at you like you're a crazy person
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.960]  But with the Apple watch because it has like the the randomized number
[34:40.720 --> 34:47.720]  Security system if I tap my card as opposed to like using my card physically. I don't have to sign for it
[34:47.720 --> 34:49.760]  So anywhere I go in Montreal
[34:49.760 --> 34:56.000]  I just I can use this as a payment system and like that alone that is that is a reason why a woman would buy
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.880]  An Apple watch. Yeah, I health tracking is a reason why they do it and a perfect example is
[35:00.560 --> 35:06.520]  My mother-in-law my mother-in-law is not into technology and and but she has an Apple watch and loves it
[35:06.520 --> 35:13.520]  but and it's not because or you know technology loving son-in-law and and you know, and my wife is
[35:13.520 --> 35:19.320]  You know not really an enthusiast but you know, you know as a has and uses, you know
[35:19.520 --> 35:21.520]  iPhone and iPad and MacBook Pro
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.480]  Pro like like we pushed it on her. It was like she asked for an Apple watch
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.400]  It wasn't like we were like here you're gonna take this like we like when we bought her and we bought her an Apple TV
[35:31.840 --> 35:36.880]  For like Christmas the one year and that was us saying I think you know, I think she'll really like that
[35:37.600 --> 35:38.200]  You know
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.400]  She was like renting movies in iTunes on her iMac and watching them on her iMac and we're like this is get her an Apple
[35:44.400 --> 35:46.360]  TV she has a big TV, you know
[35:46.360 --> 35:49.380]  Why in the world would you watch a movie on an iMac when you have a TV in the living room?
[35:49.380 --> 35:52.900]  So that was us Apple TV was us buying her something
[35:52.900 --> 35:56.700]  She would not have asked for but she wanted an Apple watch because she already had a Fitbit which again
[35:56.700 --> 35:58.700]  We didn't buy her. She bought the Fitbit herself
[35:58.700 --> 36:00.660]  And absolutely loves it
[36:00.660 --> 36:05.020]  I don't think that my mother-in-law would have bought an Apple watch if it was only in 42 millimeters
[36:05.260 --> 36:08.620]  Because she had no she has I mean truly tiny wrists
[36:09.500 --> 36:14.020]  It I just wouldn't have occurred to her, you know, and the fit, you know
[36:14.020 --> 36:20.340]  It's certainly not to replace a little Fitbit band. That was you know, just like a bracelet. Yeah, exactly
[36:20.340 --> 36:24.060]  Well, if you look at the fit at the Fitbit's other heart rate trackers
[36:24.500 --> 36:31.060]  Until you get to the smartwatch size and actually start playing around with smartwatches. They are they're very skinny little little
[36:31.940 --> 36:36.660]  Bands that look like bangles and those are you know, those there's nothing nothing against those
[36:36.660 --> 36:41.780]  Those are actually quite useful if all you want to do is heart rate and sleep rate track
[36:41.780 --> 36:48.300]  like if you don't want the other the other smartwatch features, then that's a perfectly good alternative option, but
[36:48.820 --> 36:52.480]  There's a lot to be said about what the Apple watch and Android wear watches can offer
[36:52.860 --> 36:57.820]  that and that brings me my last app related topic or Apple watch related topic and I
[36:58.620 --> 37:03.480]  I know we've mentioned this recently but it's it's come up again is I
[37:03.980 --> 37:10.120]  Cannot believe how many people out there continue to persist in this belief that the Apple watch is a flop
[37:10.120 --> 37:11.880]  I
[37:11.880 --> 37:16.840]  I'm astounded on a daily basis how many people I see on the street wearing Apple watch
[37:16.840 --> 37:20.760]  I it seems to me like incredible and and the reason it popped up is
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.440]  like that there was a story a couple of weeks ago a month ago month or two ago where
[37:26.960 --> 37:32.240]  The Boston Red Sox got caught by the Yankees using an Apple watch to receive
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.360]  information that you're not supposed to use digital equipment in the dugout of a baseball game and it turns out they weren't actually using an
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.360]  Apple watch it was a Fitbit
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.040]  Supposedly, but it got all sorts of traction and I you know linked to it
[37:47.800 --> 37:52.000]  but the joke that was made by like a hundred different people on Twitter was
[37:52.720 --> 37:57.280]  The real story here is that somebody actually found a use for an Apple watch and everybody, you know
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.560]  and it's like 5,000 likes repeats and stuff like that and I don't get that at all guys like
[38:02.560 --> 38:08.640]  It to me and it's not it's like a mentality I think of I
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.040]  Think it comes from a place where where people who aren't into technology and
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.080]  Don't have an Apple watch and don't think they don't want an Apple watch and maybe they don't maybe they're right that they that they
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.680]  Really don't want one
[38:22.680 --> 38:25.560]  but I feel like it comes from a sort of a
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.760]  resentment of the rise of technology technological devices in our lives
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.520]  You know that there are you know that they they themselves know I'm not going anywhere without my smartphone
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.040]  But I kind of resent that, you know
[38:37.040 --> 38:37.960]  Like yeah
[38:37.960 --> 38:38.560]  and
[38:38.560 --> 38:46.280]  that they don't want they so not want another one thing to become like an essential part of people's dailies lives that they they sort of
[38:47.480 --> 38:54.720]  Decided that it's useless and that's it, you know it and and then work backwards from from that wish
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.720]  We're too connected. No more connected devices. No, I get that
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.800]  And and honestly like if you take a step back and you look at the Apple watch from a lens of a non
[39:04.960 --> 39:10.720]  Technologist or somebody who's just not interested in having technology on the wrist. They see it as oh, this is another thing
[39:10.720 --> 39:17.000]  That's just gonna blow like annoy me to death with notifications or what forcing me to stand. What is this nonsense?
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.040]  You know, like I understand where people are coming from there
[39:20.040 --> 39:26.640]  And then there's the other the other side of the coin where people saw the Apple watch in its series one days
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.400]  right where apps took over two minutes to launch and
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.400]  You know, oh, yeah, I can use Siri but when does Siri actually work, you know?
[39:36.400 --> 39:42.320]  and I I do think that that in some ways worked against it because while Apple was still kind of figuring out the speed of
[39:42.320 --> 39:44.320]  this thing and and how to
[39:44.320 --> 39:51.560]  manufacture it, you know, there were a lot of Apple watch apps on day one, but mmm very few of them were very good because
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.360]  Obviously people were building Apple watch apps without actually having an Apple watch in hand
[39:55.960 --> 40:01.440]  And because they took forever everybody was like, well, this is a subpar experience and just kind of walked away
[40:02.240 --> 40:04.040]  and there are
[40:04.040 --> 40:10.000]  Like I say that but two years later, there are really really good watch apps out there
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.600]  there are some really bad ones too, but there are some really really smart ones that take advantage of the size of the watch and
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.160]  make sense of like these are the things that you would use your watch for and like if I just did
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.880]  Go down a list of like things that I regularly use my Apple watch for I use it for fitness tracking, right?
[40:28.880 --> 40:35.120]  I use Siri on the series 3 non-stop because Siri is actually functional and reliable
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.000]  Um, not only is it much faster through the iPhone, but now with LTE
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.840]  It's it's almost instantaneous if I want to just you know, call it up. I use the Apple watch
[40:45.840 --> 40:48.700]  There's an app that lets you automatically translate
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.680]  Speech to whatever language you want
[40:51.680 --> 40:56.480]  So if I'm like if I'm walking around Montreal and I see a word that I don't recognize
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.840]  Literally, all I have to do is pull up that that watch app and say the word or at least try and approximate the pronunciation
[41:02.840 --> 41:06.300]  And it'll give me a translation. Um, I use it for
[41:07.200 --> 41:14.960]  two-factor authentication all the damn time because authy has an app built in that literally just gives you your two-factor codes
[41:15.200 --> 41:19.780]  So instead of having to like grab my iPhone and log into authy and find the code
[41:19.780 --> 41:25.320]  I literally just opened the app and it's on my wrist and I can type it out on my computer or on my iPhone without
[41:25.320 --> 41:28.880]  Having to switch things. I use it for sports information, right?
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.980]  I the at bat is kind of a it's a little bit buggy
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.600]  But it is really impressive the the amount of information that they want to give it to you
[41:36.600 --> 41:39.220]  You know, yeah, I use it actually big
[41:39.360 --> 41:45.320]  Here's a big thing that I use it for especially on the 8 plus and this is a feature that I feel like people don't
[41:45.320 --> 41:48.780]  Really know about is that the Apple watch can be used as a camera remote
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.240]  So you can you know have a full screen display of your iPhone camera on your wrist
[41:55.240 --> 42:00.520]  But not only that you can take photos with it and now with a watch OS 4 and iOS 11
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.120]  You can use it to take video and you can use it to take portrait mode photos
[42:04.120 --> 42:08.800]  So the for the first time like even if you don't have an iPhone 10 and you're not gonna be able to take portrait selfies
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.100]  If you can set your iPhone up somewhere, you can still take a portrait mode photo with your watch
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.480]  It's like things like that things like the weather things like to do's
[42:17.840 --> 42:22.680]  Like there's just there's a lot there is really quite a lot that you can do with with the Apple watch
[42:22.680 --> 42:29.240]  So like what you were saying it absolutely frustrates me to hear people just blow off the watch is like oh
[42:29.240 --> 42:35.280]  It's just another thing that's gonna tap you on the wrist incessantly and make you hate it. It's it's useful. It's useful
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.400]  I said and I say this coming as somebody who is I like my Apple watch
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.200]  But I don't I'm not like I don't wear it 24-7 like cuz I I still like wearing mechanical watches
[42:45.200 --> 42:47.400]  So I'm not even the world's biggest Apple watch fan
[42:47.400 --> 42:54.640]  You know and the big loss with that is that I don't really get consistent fitness tracking, you know
[42:54.640 --> 42:58.080]  If if days, you know, if I don't even wear it over the weekend, you know
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.160]  It's it and it in the back of my mind
[43:01.160 --> 43:06.280]  It bugs me a little and I can totally see how for some people that would it would
[43:06.760 --> 43:11.400]  Drive them crazy and they would just they would have to wear their Apple watch all the time. I totally get that
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.520]  I just don't have the bug to want that complete fitness tracking like I kind of wish I had it
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.440]  But it's not enough to make me only wear Apple watch
[43:20.440 --> 43:25.480]  But so I'm coming from the perspective of somebody who's not the biggest Apple watch fan in the world
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.880]  I I just I'm blown away by how many people I see in the real world who have them
[43:31.120 --> 43:35.440]  You know, we had a family get-together in the summer. I was a wedding in on Amy's side of the family
[43:36.320 --> 43:37.360]  and
[43:37.360 --> 43:39.480]  I forget how many people we had we
[43:39.480 --> 43:42.920]  if some you know the was down in South Carolina and they rented a
[43:43.200 --> 43:48.520]  big house at the shore for everybody to stay in for for a couple of days and
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.840]  They were like, I don't know 13 14 people 15 people
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.400]  They'm not all necessarily in the same house
[43:56.400 --> 44:02.200]  But 15 people who were gathered together for the extended weekend of this thing and it was like more than half of them had Apple
[44:02.200 --> 44:07.120]  Watch and that's not for me. That's not like, you know, that's not even on my side of the family. It's just that
[44:07.120 --> 44:14.040]  It I don't know. It just kind of surprises me it that that it's that it's considered not a hit
[44:14.560 --> 44:17.800]  Here's my last pervasive my last thing and I wrote about this
[44:17.800 --> 44:19.420]  I think I don't think I ever mentioned it on the show
[44:19.420 --> 44:22.880]  But after I wrote about it, I got so much email about I have to repeat it
[44:22.880 --> 44:26.280]  my favorite tip for watchos 4 is that you can
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.120]  Replace the app screen honeycomb layout with a simple
[44:31.120 --> 44:36.720]  Scrolling list of apps which I find way more way easier to navigate
[44:37.280 --> 44:40.280]  Alphabetically ordered so you also get the app names
[44:40.280 --> 44:45.320]  Like I feel like part of the problem with the honeycomb isn't just that the apps are too small
[44:45.560 --> 44:48.320]  Like I have a couple problems with it. I think they're too small there
[44:48.320 --> 44:54.420]  They are that they are way smaller than the minimum tap target that Apple recommends for iOS, you know
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.560]  Too many of the icons look the same like they just look like aren't you know?
[44:59.560 --> 45:05.760]  Like the stopwatch is an orange circle and the timer is an orange circle and they're all orange circles
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.640]  It's so frustrating right and the timer icon arguably could be a stopwatch
[45:11.600 --> 45:19.040]  Yes, it's it's it's literally the same icon except the stopwatch has both of the hands pace pointing to the 12 and the timer
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.040]  Has it right pointing to like 11?
[45:21.720 --> 45:22.760]  awful
[45:22.760 --> 45:24.200]  and
[45:24.200 --> 45:31.160]  It's like it is pretty it is very pretty so I totally get what where it came from
[45:32.480 --> 45:39.960]  It came from this sort of design is how it looks side of Apple not the design is how it works, but it's the only device
[45:40.640 --> 45:48.080]  Apple has ever made where there's a list of apps where they only show the icons without the name of the app with it
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.720]  Like the classic Macintosh showed you the icons with a name underneath
[45:52.720 --> 45:59.800]  Current Mac OS X always shows you whether you're in list view or icon view or whatever always shows you the name of the app
[46:00.600 --> 46:02.920]  The iPhone shows you the name of the app
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.360]  Everything shows you the name of the app because the name is actually you know
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.440]  Even though the icon might be the most recognizable thing. It's still useful to have a name
[46:10.440 --> 46:15.880]  so anyway, you can switch to a list view but the way you do it is not obvious what you do is you go to the
[46:16.840 --> 46:19.160]  app view and you do a
[46:19.160 --> 46:25.000]  3d touch you press and then you get an option for grid view or list view and
[46:25.840 --> 46:30.360]  I had so many so anybody with an Apple watch. I recommend you try it
[46:30.360 --> 46:33.040]  I think you'll like it when you when you do need to go to app for you
[46:33.040 --> 46:36.160]  I think you'll like it so much more. I think it should be the default frankly. I
[46:36.800 --> 46:37.800]  Think so, too
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.920]  The other thing I really like about it is that it takes your hands off of the screen because you can just scroll with the
[46:42.920 --> 46:44.920]  Digital crown, right?
[46:45.040 --> 46:47.040]  Half of the screen. Yeah
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.600]  It's great. I love that tip. All right, let's take a break and I'll thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at

[47:47.540 --> 47:49.220]  ible
[47:49.220 --> 47:50.940]  calm
[47:50.940 --> 47:52.940]  talk show
[47:54.060 --> 47:59.140]  They like it when I include a recommendation of a book I'll tell you what book I've been reading lately
[47:59.980 --> 48:05.500]  It is a book by a New York Times sports writer long time New York Times sports writer named Bill Pennington
[48:05.500 --> 48:07.900]  And the book is Billy Martin
[48:07.900 --> 48:12.740]  Baseball's lost genius now if you don't like baseball, you're probably not gonna like this book
[48:13.540 --> 48:15.460]  But you don't have to be a Yankees fan to like it
[48:15.460 --> 48:23.380]  It's just an amazing story of a guy who Billy Martin if you don't know played for the Yankees in the 1950s with
[48:24.300 --> 48:28.060]  Mickey Mantle and those guys at the time when the Yankees were just unbelievably
[48:30.340 --> 48:33.900]  Unbelievably successful in the World Series every year and they won most of them
[48:34.820 --> 48:36.820]  but it was sort of a
[48:36.820 --> 48:39.380]  hard drinking hard living team
[48:41.060 --> 48:43.060]  And a very interesting
[48:43.940 --> 48:47.220]  era, you know, it's sort of that Mad Men era of
[48:48.540 --> 48:49.820]  20th century
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.300]  And there's so many good stories, but Billy Martin led such an amazing life
[48:54.980 --> 48:57.820]  Ended up after becoming a player was famously a manager
[48:58.420 --> 49:02.160]  I think he was fired by the Yankees six five times
[49:02.160 --> 49:06.600]  I was but it was hired six times as the manager
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.480]  I can imagine imagine getting fired by the same boss
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.000]  Five times and then coming back for a sixth time
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.280]  It's it's truly and it's a super suit. It's one of the best biographies I've ever read
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.640]  It's it's certain aspects of some biographies that I find dreadfully boring
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.400]  but this it really feel it's a thick book, but it really feels like
[49:29.400 --> 49:32.960]  There's nothing in there. There's there's no padding in there. It really is
[49:33.960 --> 49:38.520]  And you could tell that it you know it to me it you can tell that he comes from a newspaper background where space is
[49:38.520 --> 49:39.960]  at a premium
[49:39.960 --> 49:42.360]  So that's my recommendation. It's it's a great story
[49:42.360 --> 49:48.680]  I think any baseball fan Yankee fan or not would really enjoy this story because it really takes baseball from the
[49:50.280 --> 49:57.480]  Pre-modern era of the 1950s through to the modern era of up through the 1980s when Billy Martin was still managing
[49:57.480 --> 50:01.280]  So that's my recommendation. And again, you can sign up for audible at audible.com

[50:04.840 --> 50:09.800]  What's next on our list, you know what you were mentioning VIPs I have just as a small topic
[50:10.440 --> 50:15.720]  I use VIPs in email because I have notifications off for all of my email accounts
[50:15.720 --> 50:21.000]  I may have to change this really and I've had it set for years now
[50:21.640 --> 50:25.080]  that I only get notifications for VIPs and then
[50:25.080 --> 50:30.280]  And I've slowly but surely every time I see an email that I didn't get notified about and I think oh
[50:30.280 --> 50:32.280]  I wish I'd been notified about that one. I really
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.640]  Wish I would have gotten to that right away. I add that whoever sent it to VIPs
[50:38.520 --> 50:40.520]  Well, guess what? I found out
[50:40.840 --> 50:43.640]  You can only have you can only have a hundred VIPs
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.720]  I'm I guess I'm not surprised that you of all people hit up on that limit, but really only a hundred a hundred
[50:51.720 --> 50:58.120]  it's and it's it's so you once you have a hundred and then you click the star in mail to add someone you get an
[50:58.440 --> 51:02.040]  A dialog box that that tells you you can't add anymore. Here. Let me see if I can
[51:03.160 --> 51:08.360]  So there's here's somebody who I would like to add and now you gotta I get a dialog that says could not add
[51:08.600 --> 51:15.640]  VIP a maximum of 100 VIPs is allowed. Please remove any unused VIPs and try again. Okay?
[51:15.640 --> 51:22.680]  This to me and used VIPs. Well, this is actually a tricky feature because there is no like go to a list of all
[51:22.680 --> 51:30.120]  There's no interface to get to just show me all my VIPs surely if I could just open a window either in mail or in contacts
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.920]  Or make a smart group in contacts. That's only my VIPs
[51:35.800 --> 51:40.360]  Then I could like just scroll through the list and say I don't need you know, I'm sure I could easily yeah
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.120]  I don't I don't need to do that. I don't need to do that. I don't need to do that
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.960]  Easily, yeah, I don't I don't talk to this person anymore, right?
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.720]  I'm sure that I know for a fact that I've got people who
[51:50.200 --> 51:54.560]  Worked for Apple PR who are no longer with the company
[51:54.560 --> 52:00.160]  I know that they're in there, but there's no easy way to just get to a list of all your VIPs
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.680]  I mean the best it I've found is to go to the VIPs mailbox and mail and
[52:05.080 --> 52:10.040]  then and just scroll through past well and else and go to yeah and go to the you know, sort by name and
[52:10.040 --> 52:16.120]  just start looking for names that you don't care about anymore, but it's such a frustrating feature because I
[52:16.640 --> 52:23.640]  cannot imagine that there's truly a need for a technical limit of a hundred VIPs and it's such a nice even number that I just
[52:23.640 --> 52:26.440]  Imagine that when they were coding the feature
[52:28.520 --> 52:31.660]  That somebody decided up front well let let's you know
[52:32.180 --> 52:35.160]  This week, you know that we don't want people making a ton of them
[52:35.160 --> 52:39.920]  Let's make a limit and somebody just said well a hundred. All right, and then somebody coded in, you know, like
[52:41.040 --> 52:46.160]  I imagine there's just like one line of code where there's like if it's you know said limit to 100
[52:46.160 --> 52:52.520]  Yeah, like 101 and that y2k boy and that if Apple would I mean, I guess somebody out there is gonna say file a radar
[52:52.520 --> 52:53.760]  I guess I should file a radar
[52:53.760 --> 53:01.080]  But I feel like somebody could just type in you change that from 100 to 500 and it's not gonna affect performance at all
[53:01.080 --> 53:06.600]  Right, and I'm not even sure there needs to be a limit. Is there really a limit like could you you know?
[53:06.960 --> 53:13.160]  What would be the problem if I can't understand what the problem would be if if you were allowed to have?
[53:14.280 --> 53:16.280]  998 VIPs
[53:16.980 --> 53:24.260]  Yeah, well, I think that it's a how do we say a niche use case because the vast majority of people aren't really getting
[53:24.400 --> 53:29.440]  Well the vast majority of I would say normal computer users who just use email
[53:29.440 --> 53:34.660]  You know for their work and maybe the occasional family email probably don't need more than a hundred people
[53:34.880 --> 53:37.120]  But when you're dealing with you know
[53:37.120 --> 53:42.840]  If you work for a big company or if you interact with a bunch of different PR people, for example, like we do
[53:44.200 --> 53:50.040]  Not missing emails from a large group of people becomes a vastly more problematic issue
[53:50.040 --> 53:55.320]  yeah, and actually I'm kind of surprised that Apple didn't make that higher because I feel like
[53:55.320 --> 54:02.280]  There are a lot of people, you know, if you're in Apple internally, you're like, oh, I can't miss an email from XYZ
[54:02.280 --> 54:07.300]  You know all of these if Eddie either ever emails me if Tim ever emails me
[54:07.300 --> 54:09.800]  I probably need to have them set as VIPs
[54:10.960 --> 54:16.100]  Yeah, I don't know in my opinion. Honestly, it's a workaround right because the
[54:16.680 --> 54:19.480]  And I don't know how I feel about this right now
[54:19.480 --> 54:26.440]  But I'm I'm leaning towards the fact that like our mail is going to turn into like closer to
[54:27.020 --> 54:32.160]  Google's like auto, you know in contextual sorted mailboxes sooner or later
[54:32.320 --> 54:36.060]  Like they're Apple Apple hasn't really experimented with this yet
[54:37.160 --> 54:40.260]  Beyond like when you search it tries to give you top results
[54:40.260 --> 54:46.020]  But I can't help but think that we're gonna see core ml used to to try and really
[54:46.020 --> 54:49.540]  Contextualize your emails so that okay
[54:49.620 --> 54:54.700]  Well, we know that whenever you get an email from this person you almost immediately write back
[54:54.840 --> 54:59.460]  So we're gonna make sure that this this goes to the top of the list and that's just that's just something that doesn't exist
[54:59.580 --> 55:02.900]  Yet in mail, so we'll we might see it down the line
[55:02.900 --> 55:10.540]  but I just I don't think that Apple in endgame wants you to have to organize your emails or put them into folders or any of
[55:10.540 --> 55:13.200]  that they like the the whole point of
[55:13.200 --> 55:20.640]  the the problem of email right now is just that it gets drowning if you get too much you get spam you get everything else you
[55:20.640 --> 55:27.720]  Get things that aren't spam, but basically are in the form of like 10 million. You know, I can't count the amount of
[55:28.360 --> 55:32.240]  Like shops that send me daily newsletters of like this is a sale
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.520]  Don't you want this sale and I was like no, I thought one thing from you once
[55:38.360 --> 55:40.720]  It's a real problem for me. I've always been bad at email
[55:40.720 --> 55:45.120]  I say it on my website contact form that I'm a terrible correspondent
[55:45.880 --> 55:51.360]  But it's it's gotten worse for me. It really is and part of it. Is that I'm a one-person company
[55:51.680 --> 55:54.740]  I mean, I guess I mean I've thought about it like
[55:55.400 --> 56:00.000]  like hiring an assistant or something, but it seems it seems so
[56:00.580 --> 56:04.040]  Decadent to me like I feel like I don't need an assistant
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.620]  All I have to do is write this website and do a podcast, you know 40 times a year
[56:08.620 --> 56:13.780]  It just seems ridiculous to me that I can't answer my own email
[56:13.780 --> 56:20.380]  But I find that on days where I like commit myself to like at least read every email that comes in and you know
[56:20.380 --> 56:22.060]  Have like a my today
[56:22.060 --> 56:28.300]  I have a smart mailbox that says like today and it's just every email in these from these three accounts
[56:28.300 --> 56:30.300]  That's come in and last 24 hours
[56:30.700 --> 56:37.180]  And the days where I'm like, I'm gonna commit to zeroing out that not not like inbox zero like forget that I mean
[56:37.180 --> 56:39.380]  Just today's inbox zero
[56:40.020 --> 56:43.980]  The days when I do that, I get so much less done writing for daring fireball
[56:43.980 --> 56:49.820]  I really do like it just turns it into like like a day where I have, you know
[56:49.820 --> 56:53.500]  it just keeping up with my email feels like a day where I have like a
[56:53.900 --> 56:57.580]  doctor's appointment and I need to pick the kid up from school and
[56:58.580 --> 57:02.820]  Or like there's the kid has a basketball game after school or something like that
[57:02.820 --> 57:07.220]  Like it just feels like, you know, just email alone. It ruins my day
[57:07.560 --> 57:08.060]  Really?
[57:08.060 --> 57:13.220]  It literally does and then there's days where I just like ignore it and like don't even look at my mail and I get so
[57:13.220 --> 57:14.900]  much more done
[57:14.900 --> 57:16.380]  Mm-hmm. No, absolutely
[57:16.380 --> 57:22.140]  I at this point I kind of and even I slack is starting to go into that category for me too
[57:22.140 --> 57:24.140]  Because I now have like seven slack groups
[57:24.580 --> 57:29.760]  But honestly the the only thing that I feel like I'm really present and able to answer
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.440]  Going back to our original conversation is messages is these real-time notifications?
[57:34.440 --> 57:40.040]  Yeah, because I'm like if it's real time, then I either have to answer it right this second or I just don't answer it
[57:40.040 --> 57:46.920]  Yep, and you know, I don't mind that no, I I messages to change, you know, it's so essential to me
[57:46.920 --> 57:53.560]  It really is it's because I my I message is always at zero or if it's not it's like it three
[57:53.560 --> 57:56.560]  You know, oh
[57:56.920 --> 58:02.160]  Yeah, it's like it's it's oh I just haven't read this in the last hour I'm gonna go check it
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.880]  No speaking of email. I got a great email. I mean, I am over the moon
[58:06.880 --> 58:09.520]  I got a great email yesterday from amazon.com
[58:10.800 --> 58:14.600]  I got my settlement in the Apple ebooks antitrust
[58:15.880 --> 58:17.880]  Did you get you get your credit yet? I?
[58:17.880 --> 58:23.360]  I just I found a thing. Is this the one that says your App Store credit?
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.260]  I don't know about that. This one's from amazon.com and it says I didn't I didn't get dear Johnny Gruber
[58:30.260 --> 58:35.320]  You have a credit of one dollar and fifty two cents in your Amazon account Apple incorporated
[58:35.440 --> 58:40.000]  funded this credit to settle antitrust lawsuits brought by state's Attorney General and
[58:40.440 --> 58:43.320]  class plaintiffs about the price of electronic ebooks
[58:43.320 --> 58:51.360]  That's oh my lord fantastic, I got a dollar fifty-two, thank God this a whole dollar I
[58:53.960 --> 58:59.360]  Yeah, I don't I have a friend I do have a friend when these emails first started coming out
[58:59.360 --> 59:02.120]  I have a friend in the one slack group
[59:02.120 --> 59:08.760]  I'm really active in who I think is truly a voracious reader and he got like seven seven dollars and thirty cents
[59:08.760 --> 59:10.760]  It's
[59:12.440 --> 59:19.360]  So ridiculous above and beyond the merits of the that ebook case and my argument
[59:20.520 --> 59:27.960]  Again, I just think that I think that a US antitrust law is I've written about this, but I think it's hopelessly
[59:29.440 --> 59:36.140]  Distorted in the it's convoluted. Well, but the basics of modern US antitrust law and they come from actually
[59:36.140 --> 59:40.540]  like the main theorists behind them was they actually what's-his-name Robert Bork the
[59:41.260 --> 59:42.620]  infamous
[59:42.620 --> 59:45.780]  Reagan nominee to the Supreme Court who got rejected. Oh, man
[59:46.860 --> 59:52.700]  But he it'll like it in the 70s 1970s are there about I could get to have the decade wrong
[59:52.700 --> 59:56.460]  They US antitrust law become became solely focused on
[59:57.780 --> 01:00:03.900]  consumer prices and that the idea is that it's not this is how you tell if a monopoly is being abused if
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.940]  If prices are raised if the prices consumers pay are are
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.460]  Unnaturally raised so a perfect example of that where it actually was I think
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:20.020]  in in the interests of both the market and consumers and just fair was
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.620]  breaking up AT&T where
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:30.580]  When I grew up a long-distance phone call cost like a dollar a minute and
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.580]  And
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.300]  Even as late as when I was in college like
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.260]  Amy was in Pittsburgh. I was in Philadelphia and
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:44.820]  the best way, you know, the the only ways we really communicated were either on the phone or
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.740]  Like there were terminal terminal based text chatting things that we we could do
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:59.400]  There was no you you couldn't talk over the internet, you know, there wasn't anything like Skype it was impossible
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.880]  And we it was like my biggest monthly cost
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.620]  Even like like up there with food was my phone bill just from talking, you know
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.560]  Our here, you know an hour once or twice a week to Amy from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. It was ridiculous
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.560]  so there's a case like what the
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.360]  Where the phone companies, you know, we're the prices we paid for telephone calls were ridiculous
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.080]  And once they got broken up it very very quickly just not quickly enough for someone who went to college in the mid 90s
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.280]  Dropped to the point where nobody even thinks about long-distance anymore, right? Like it doesn't really matter
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.760]  Yeah, it's like a fraction of a cent if it's not automatically included
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.620]  It just don't even it like how far away the person is doesn't really even matter, you know
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:50.460]  Let alone that we were using cell phones that don't really you know, it's just breaking it up was good for consumers
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:56.060]  I think it's ridiculous that I don't want to relitigate the case
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.100]  but I think it's ridiculous to argue that Apple with iBooks was the
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.700]  antitrust violator and
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.020]  Amazon with get the Kindle which sells like
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.540]  75% of all ebooks was the the victim
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.020]  But anyway, it's it the other thing and I forget who wrote about this
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.580]  I don't know if it was Ben Thompson or who but it's a good case to be made that class-action lawsuits in general are
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:27.460]  A racket a true racket and the only people who truly benefit from them financially ever are the lawyers
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.460]  Who take like 20% or something like that?
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:36.340]  so there's lawyers who brought this case against Apple get like 20% of the settlement, which is a
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:43.860]  Windfall because it just goes to like one law firm and the actual quote-unquote victims us the consumers who were buying
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.420]  Kindle books that cost $11.99 instead of $9.99. I
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.620]  I got a dollar 52
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.500]  One whole book congratulations, John. Thank God. I can't buy a book for a dollar 52
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.980]  No, the difference right in one, right?
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.300]  Did you you didn't get one of these if you had I
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:10.860]  Have it. I have a different email in my box. I have an email that says something about
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:19.300]  On e-book settlement credit redistribution of funds you previously received credits in your Apple account resulting from settlements in the case
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:27.500]  Titled in re-electronic books antitrust litigation. We are happy to inform you that a supplemental distribution of credits has been approved by October 18th
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.420]  You have a new automatic credit in your Apple account. You can use your credit online for
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:39.460]  Products or services sold by Apple. So apparently I got something to use on the iBook store. I got the same email
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:44.020]  I only found it though by searching it went to my junk. It's from ebook settlement at
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:51.960]  Cued QG email huge email. No, I wonder why that went to I wonder why that went to space. Yeah
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.620]  Hmm. I wonder yeah, I didn't check my junk. Maybe my
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.460]  Maybe my Amazon credit or maybe it's just cuz I don't buy
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.300]  Books on I I actually am one of the few people who buy books on iBooks. I
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.740]  Vastly prefer it. I
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.220]  I
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.980]  I tend to buy them on paper to be honest. Yeah, that's fair. I really do
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.380]  I I buy you know what this is a maybe this is a little bit of a digression
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.780]  But I feel like if it's a book that I'm gonna pulp through, you know
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:28.420]  Like it's the kind of thing that I want to just read in the summer or I'm reading on a plane or something
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.500]  Or if it's the start of a series where I know I'm gonna have to buy like 12 books
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:39.100]  I buy it all online because I'm like chances are I don't really care enough about these books that I want them in my personal
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.300]  Library, but things like children's books, which I collect and or if I read a book
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:49.860]  Online that I love I will buy that in paper, but I've I don't know I've moved too many times John
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:55.740]  I feel like I've moved house way too many times to buy paper copies of all these books. Yeah, I just
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.140]  moved
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:02.540]  I'm we moved earlier this year, but just last weekend we were
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.820]  Rearranged we still you know
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.660]  We still have the one room in the house that's just full of boxes that we haven't unpacked yet
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:12.220]  And we decided it would be better to move them down the basement. And so I
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.700]  moved these boxes down the basement and I was reminded a of
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.380]  just how
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.780]  How out of shape I am and be
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.660]  Just how goddamn heavy up one box of books it
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.100]  Really is the heaviest goddamn thing
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.300]  When I was in high school, I had a job
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.740]  we
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.900]  My high school in between
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.860]  10th and 11th grade
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:47.300]  Moved from one building to another it was we used to when I was a small kid
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:54.660]  We had the district I was in had an elementary school a middle school in a high school and it was a small public school
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.500]  Shrunk
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:02.180]  Enough that to save money they closed the middle school and then instead of having one to four in
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.340]  The one school grades five to eight in the middle school and then nine to ten
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:12.620]  They split it to one to six was in the elementary school and seven to twelve visit the high school
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:19.580]  Long story short, but they hired a bunch of kids for the summer to help move the school
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:25.220]  and so that was my summer job that year was working as a mover and
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.900]  It was you know, it was hard labor
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.940]  I mean moving is hard and but I you know
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.700]  I was I played basketball and I was athletic at that point in my life
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:43.420]  And so it was sort of like, you know, it was sort of like getting a summer job lifting weights
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.020]  I mean it wasn't that you know, that's how I saw it but
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.020]  No
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.260]  Air-conditioning moving and you know, everything is hard to move desks are hard to move
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.820]  All sorts of books are worse to move the goddamn library was the worst
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:04.340]  it was it was just hell and the worst part about was that the library was one of the last things that we moved and
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.500]  So you're already all exhausted. Yeah, and it
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.420]  It was it was one of the last things we moved in August, but the kids
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.460]  It it was a you know, I don't forget how many of us they hired
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.460]  They hired at least like a dozen of us
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.020]  But all of all of my friends all the kids who played soccer
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:28.820]  Quit because soccer practice started and I didn't play soccer. So it was like there were fewer of us
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.420]  There's a true story this is
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.900]  So now I told you I played basketball and
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:43.620]  And my basketball coach who I loved truly truly loved is it's it's you know
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:49.220]  Everything you'd ever want in a coach a true inspiration for life more than just sports
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:53.300]  He his day job was a construction worker and it just by coincidence
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:08:00.280]  His the company he worked for was hired to do the construction work to renovate the middle school to turn it into the new high school
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.620]  and
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.620]  So at one point the library
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.820]  Little one of the reasons we moved it last was that the new library was
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.060]  physically one of the last things to be finished and so
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:19.020]  We moved a whole bunch of the library books from the old high school to the new high school, but we put them in the gym
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.100]  So we do we're gonna have to move them again from the gym to the library
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:26.220]  No, and so I I
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:32.300]  Constructed a giant pile like six to eight feet tall and made more or less like a little igloo
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.980]  With a little way to crawl in and then I I'd crawl in there and take a nap
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.940]  That you know, I would I would live in a book here I would be okay with that
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:50.220]  Well the one time I'm in there taking a nap and I wake up and I hear a groomer and I thought oh shit
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.220]  I'm in trouble, you know, somebody's caught me and I look up and there's my coach
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.340]  Staring at me through there and he's like what the fuck are you doing in there?
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:04.620]  And I said I was taking a nap and he goes he's just he just muttered like Jesus Christ
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.100]  I just just like walked away. Oh
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.260]  My gosh
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:16.260]  Well, did you dream of literature at least? Yeah. Have I ever told you that I've never really held a job for very long
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.100]  Hmm I wonder why oh
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:28.860]  Oh, man, it's it just sounds like you're better working on your own time. Yeah with your own book naps
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.860]  I think that's and that's probably true
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.460]  all right, let me take a break here and
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:41.360]  Speaking of naps. Let's talk about Squarespace. That's the worst segue ever. There's nothing there's really nothing related to naps with Squarespace
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:46.100]  Maybe if you're if you're starting up a new mattress reviewing. Yeah, there you go. Perhaps. Yeah
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.740]  Yeah, you could do it on Squarespace. I've heard that. That's a thing. Uh, uh
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500]  Squarespace look next time you need to make a website

[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.940]  Keep saying this over and over again the number one thing to me in the back of my mind
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:51.300]  About Squarespace if I if I didn't know better is I would think that it was the sort of thing where sure
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.740]  There's a dozen templates to choose from but then your score, you know
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:00.460]  Your website's gonna look like one of these 12 Squarespace websites. That's not the way it works at all. It's so customizable
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.780]  It's ridiculous. I
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:09.180]  Swear, I you'd be shocked at how many websites you could visit on a regular basis are actually backed by Squarespace. I
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:13.740]  I don't even know what led me to do it, but I did a view source on the home page at Pixar.com
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.620]  And their Squarespace tags are in there at the top
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:23.060]  Like that's that's how good Squarespace is and that's one of the other things too about Squarespace

[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.720]  Am so curious about how that how that is going like cuz we have heard
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.720]  Collectively as far as I know
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:02.400]  Absolutely, not one word from Apple about the iPhone 10 since the event like
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:09.120]  You know, we have a date and we haven't heard anything that the date isn't going to is going to be delayed
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.000]  But there's been no I mean just nothing. It's it's sort of weird. You know, it's it's
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.440]  just sort of like a
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.640]  Here's this amazing phone that we've been anticipating for an entire year
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.380]  Here's a date two months from now and in the meantime
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.460]  Nothing other than I guess have fun sitting on your hands, right?
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:36.580]  I guess the only thing we've really heard from Apple about this since the event are the developer guidelines for how to deal with the
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.200]  rounded corners on the notch
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:46.460]  But even that was obviously prepared in advance of the event. It just was rolled out to the developer channels, you know in the week afterwards I
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.460]  I
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:54.820]  Mean I you know, and we can't even make a topic out of it, you know, it's not something there's there's nothing we know about it
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:15:00.140]  Yeah, it's literally so there's a new iPhone coming in in about a week and a half John
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.140]  Do you think that they'll actually?
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:07.740]  Ship it on the day that it is available. Like is there going to be stuck? I
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.980]  Would guess that if it was delayed that they would
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:16.980]  Announce it as soon as they knew it was gonna be delayed, you know, because the later, you know that get the bad news out of
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.820]  the way
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:23.640]  So I guess it's going to go on sale on time and and we'll ship but in what quantity who knows, you know
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.380]  Is it gonna be there's like 10 of them available?
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.380]  and if you're like one of the lucky people who get your order in at 12 Oh Oh and
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.420]  Three seconds, you know three seconds after they flip the switch at the store that you're one of the lucky ones who gets one
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:39.700]  I don't I don't know. Is it you know, are they successfully going to?
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.220]  pump
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:45.660]  15 million of them into people's hands on November 3rd. I who knows
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:49.500]  But as far as I know a pencil o'clock, yeah, I don't know
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:56.040]  Yeah, I know nothing all right one of the other big topics that have come up this week was
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:01.800]  The reliability of MacBook modern MacBook keyboards the new low travel
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:07.020]  I think I think the new ones are the butterfly or is butterfly the old yeah
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.660]  The it's a it's a variation on the butterfly
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.260]  And this week's was prompted by an absolutely to me
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.500]  Outstanding story that Casey Johnston wrote for the outline about her
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.700]  Like six months or so old MacBook Pro
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.220]  Which she you know, I love that
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.260]  I just love the lead of the story where it's just you you know
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:34.140]  The you are there style of she's at the Genius bar and the guys running
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:39.380]  Like the third of three like half-hour software diagnostics on her
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.580]  MacBook because this it's like the spacebar doesn't work or every time she hits the spacebar
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.580]  She gets two spaces is the problem and the guys
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.780]  Says it could be a piece of dust
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.740]  And it's the third time she's had to take it in for the same problem
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:17:00.660]  and it's the third time that the genius, you know a different third different genius to say it could be a piece of dust and and
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.580]  It's like she's in Craig like the first time it happened. She just thought she got a
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.420]  Dopey genius, you know, because how could it be a piece of you know, how could a piece of dust?
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.160]  Break your it's actually do this break your brand new
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.860]  You know MacBook
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.860]  keyboard
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:23.180]  But now that it's the third it's sort of like huh, I guess this is the standard answer and
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.380]  Wow, and I just know anecdotally, you know, I've heard from
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.700]  you know
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:36.840]  I hear from a lot of people because I you know people random readers will write in with the problems or listeners of the show
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:42.940]  But even just friends, you know, I have friends who've had problems with these keyboards. And again
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.620]  separate the
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.540]  Subjective
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:52.780]  Like when the keyboard is operating perfectly as designed whether you like it or not
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:58.860]  which is debatable and I've you know, I'm almost infamous for having very picky taste in and
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:07.140]  Maybe even eclectic taste in keyboards with my preference for mechanical ones at the desktop like that Apple extended keyboard to put aside that
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600]  subjective opinion of the keyboard
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:17.180]  Objectively it it seems obvious that there is a severe problem with the reliability of these keyboards that they break
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.580]  keys get stuck
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.780]  Yeah
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.960]  And it's I I just had a friend the other day just the day I linked it and he was like amazing
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.380]  I cannot believe that you posted this this day and he sent me like a video and it's like his Q key like every other
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.380]  Time he presses it it stays down
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:40.460]  like it's so it's not even like a key that is you need all the time like somebody told me that somebody on Twitter said
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:45.200]  That their I key was stuck and the goal and the genius suggested
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.300]  just not using the letter I and
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:55.500]  until it gets fixed or something I and it's like how can you know, if you don't want to send it away for three days
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:02.700]  You know just don't use the letter I and he'd like looked at him like are you serious is this I mean like
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.620]  All right, like maybe if it was like the tilde key, you know the one with the backtick
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.140]  Yeah, maybe you could actually get by for a while unless you're like writing pearl code or something
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.140]  It
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.700]  There's a key that maybe you don't need all that often but it's like
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.380]  There's a real problem here. I mean, there's I don't think there's any question about it
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:29.020]  I mean, it obviously doesn't affect everybody. That's the other thing too is it's like there's some people who it's like I
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:35.260]  So so want to not believe anything bad about Apple that they're like
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.220]  well, I have this keyboard and none of my keys are stuck so they must be doing something wrong and
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.740]  It's like no, that's it's mm
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:46.540]  It's just it it literally. Yeah, I don't know. I think it comes down to you a
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.820]  Do you eat near your computer?
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:56.540]  be do you use your computer in an area where debris or other particles might get under it and
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.660]  See, how often do you use your computer like those those three things?
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:08.340]  I think make a huge difference in how that keyboard works because I didn't have any problems with it up until
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.540]  September when we went out for the for the iPhone launch
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:18.620]  and when I was sitting down, you know after we we'd done the event and we were hanging out at the visitors center and
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.580]  writing some things and I I made the mistake of
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:27.940]  Eating a sandwich next to my computer and I don't normally do this. I think we've had this discussion before
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.340]  I don't really eat near my computer, but I ate a sandwich and
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:37.900]  two little tiny crumbs somehow got stuck under the R key and the space key respectively and
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:45.820]  Therein I spent probably five days hammering at both of those keys to try and break down whatever
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:54.300]  Molecule got stuck in it to make it unresponsive and that was miserable and since then I've had like occasional problems with the spacebar
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.580]  But I was just like what is going on? It's a design problem on Apple's part though
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:04.580]  Because you you can't design for what people should do if you believe people should never
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:09.460]  Eat near their computer or use their computer in a dusty environment
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:14.340]  You have to design for what people do do and people do eat near their computers
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:20.620]  I mean my son that I don't but my son does my son because my son's macbook my son and I have the exact same
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:25.820]  Macbook, we have the a three-year-old 20 mid 2014 13 inch macbook Pro
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.100]  and
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.140]  We didn't quite buy him at the same time. I got mine first and then he got his for Christmas that year
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.420]  Mine is in better condition than his but his is in good condition for a
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:45.700]  13 year old kid. I I think you were the three-year-old with a macbook and that he
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.300]  at his school
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.660]  Starting in like seventh grade. The kids are expected to take a notebook to school every day
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:56.780]  So he you know, it's not just like around the house type thing but around the house
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:02.820]  It's his TV because he watches, you know, his TV is like YouTube and Netflix
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:12.740]  And he's preferred device by far is his macbook, you know, he has an iPad that's practically unused and
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:17.100]  you know who used his phone, but it's you know, the macbook has the bigger screen and the
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:22.220]  fact that it's always probable up compared to an iPad is
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:29.020]  You know, it's a huge appeal to him. But that means he eats with it. It's it's you know, again, it's not a messy
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.780]  It's not like it's smeared with food
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:38.140]  But he's definitely got crumbs under it and his spacebar got stuck the spacebar on his three-year-old macbook Pro got stuck
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:43.580]  Recently and he just lived with it. Even though it was stuck. It still worked which is
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.620]  It was amazing. Like it didn't really feel like it was going down
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:52.620]  But when you hit it, it was almost like the spacebar on an iPad keyboard, you know on the screen, right?
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:56.300]  It was like a touch spacebar like you'd touch it
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:59.260]  It didn't click but a space would appear where you're typing
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:03.500]  So he was like ads fine and I was like no I can fix this and it you know used like a little
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.060]  little prying tool
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:09.660]  To pop the spacebar off and I didn't see anything in particular
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:14.940]  But there was us, you know, just some schmutz air got the air air can of air out blew it around
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.900]  pop the spacebar back on it clicked properly into place and
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.340]  Good as new like I didn't even have to take it to an Apple store and it was totally fixable
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:30.700]  And that's an extreme condition. This is a kid who eats a lot of sandwiches near his keyboard
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:36.620]  So it's not just the fact like the problem with these new macbook keyboards isn't just the fact that
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:42.060]  The keys get stuck uncommonly easy. It's that the fix for it is
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:51.500]  Incredibly inconvenient they send it away and replace the entire top of the the the bottom of the of the computer for you know
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500]  It takes like three days to turn around
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.060]  Yeah, that's not fantastic
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:03.660]  So, how did you pop the key off? Did you just use a spudger? Yeah, I just used a spudger and going off
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:08.140]  Did you just use a spudger? Yeah, I just used a spudger and going from I I actually did some I
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:13.420]  This is one of the areas where youtube is so cool. Like just go, you know search youtube for
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:19.180]  A stuck spacebar on a macbook and you'll find videos of people who you know
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:24.620]  Doing it so you like you can gain the experience of seeing somebody do it properly
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:29.420]  uh the way I did it in a way some of the videos that I saw that looked to me like the safest way of
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.860]  Doing it were
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.660]  Is to go from the bottom of the spacebar?
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:40.620]  And pop pop and then pull it up the bottom up first and then very carefully, you know unclip the rest of them
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.700]  And it's you know, you study it if you look at it and you can look at the videos
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.980]  It's it's pretty easy to see how it goes back on and where it connects
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:52.700]  And now again, this is not the current keyboard. This is the the last generation keyboard
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500]  uh
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.460]  Before doing that before popping the key off. I tried just blowing air without popping it off, you know
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:06.140]  It's sort of like do the least invasive thing first just sort of try to blow and that didn't that that didn't fix it
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.620]  But just popping it off blowing air
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.700]  Just you know rubbing anything off and making sure the little rubber thing in the center
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:17.980]  That's actually where the the key press registers was clean and then popping it back on and it was good as new
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.580]  It seems ridiculous to me that to get an unstuck key fixed. They have to send your computer away for three days
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.100]  Yeah, it shouldn't be that hard. It really shouldn't and and like I when I wrote about it
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.820]  It's like it just the keyboard has to be
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:36.380]  Again feel a bit aside whether you like the way this new keyboard feels or not
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.220]  Or whether you think it's the sound is weird. The sound is a little click here
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:45.660]  I can I totally I I in my testing of the the new macbook pros last year
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:52.220]  Within a week. I got to like it and and I do see I love the way that the keys don't wiggle around at all
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:55.260]  Like in a sense it does feel more premium
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:26:00.060]  When it's working properly because the keys are sort of like in a way the whole key goes down at once
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.220]  um
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.060]  I I think if I owned one and it worked properly i'd get used to it quickly, uh
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.100]  And grow to like it
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.420]  I I think all lapd
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:18.540]  I've never had a laptop keyboard any laptop keyboard that to me feels as good as as a extended keyboard to mechanical keyboard or even
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.100]  Even just the the current apple
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:25.340]  Modern, you know wireless keyboard just because there's more room for the keys to travel
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:32.940]  But your keyboard on your laptop has to be reliable it has to be like it's you know
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:38.220]  And again every everybody's computer, you know or some number of every computer is going to have problems
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.860]  And have to go in you have to send it to the store and be without it for a few days
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.580]  And it's a first generation
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:50.460]  You know the touch the touch bar mac is still technically a first generation product as annoying as that is
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:55.980]  It's still you know, it's the caveats of early, you know early adopter apply
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:59.340]  but it really does seem like the nature of this keyboard is that you you
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:05.420]  I don't know that you can expect to go three years without having the keyboard get stuck
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:12.940]  And that's a huge problem. Like I don't know. I just feel like I want my macbook to be ready to go
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.660]  with complete reliability
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:21.120]  All the time every day, you know non-stop and the things that have to be reliable the keyboard
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.420]  The screen and the trackpad have to be completely reliable
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.460]  those are the three, you know and and
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:34.140]  anything else like how fast it is how much ram it is that's all you know, configuring but the the the
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:37.980]  The things you actually interface with the thing you look at is the screen
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.100]  And the two things you touch are the keyboard and the trackpad
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:47.180]  They they have to be completely reliable that the fundamental nature of the device is what you see and what you touch
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:55.180]  Yeah, and if it's if you get stuck keys or if you get a trackpad that's glitchy or doesn't move smoothly
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:00.860]  I mean, it's the same thing as the the early, you know, uh, like the resistive touch
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:06.620]  Screens, right which were just so awful to use right and it's like if you're if your main
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:12.880]  Interaction point with a device is not great. You're not going to want to use the device
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.040]  Or you're going to get frustrated with it. That's a perfect example. It really is. Um
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.600]  Uh, I just as a semi-recent example, we had the the Wii U
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.000]  uh, which the one that came that's the Wii that the successor to the Wii that came with a controller that had a
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.620]  touch screen on the controller
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:38.220]  And the touch screen was so I don't think it was resistive as I think it was capacitive
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.300]  But it was so bad and it had lag
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:47.260]  That it just it it made it feel unreliable. It just felt like and once you were used to
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:54.180]  iPhone and Android caliber touch screens. It's just unacceptable to to ship one that had lag
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.780]  But that's exactly true like
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:03.100]  Like our airline seat back touch screens, right?
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:11.180]  You they're terrible. They're absolutely terrible because every once in a while your touch doesn't register. It has to be completely reliable
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.860]  And I really do worry. I mean I worry about what this says about Apple's priorities
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:24.780]  Yeah, I mean in this I I am of two minds on it because
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.340]  Because again, this is a first-generation product
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:34.980]  and I feel like Apple has probably gotten enough complaints about the keyboard at this point that they're going to have to figure out how to
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.420]  Fix it for the next version
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.580]  but it's definitely a
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:46.300]  It's definitely them saying we want the keyboard needs to be this big and it needs to be pretty make it work
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.260]  and not actually not actually realizing that you can't just
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:56.300]  Make, you know, you can't just say make it work on one of the core features of your product
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.740]  It needs to have the same, you know
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:04.580]  They put so much care into this darn trackpad right like the trackpad is a work a work of art in some ways
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.780]  And for them to just be like, yeah
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.740]  I know that more people are using touch at this point and they're probably not using keyboards that much but we still write on them
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.780]  Like until until you can give me a haptic
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:20.700]  Capacitive keyboard on a touchscreen that actually feels like writing on a keyboard
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:27.100]  I'm still gonna be using my macbook pro keyboard like the way so that macbook trackpads or even back to the power book era
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.900]  you know, I've always been the gold standard of trackpads for
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:37.300]  Everything for their accuracy for you know doing what you want
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.660]  Happening and something you don't want not happening
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:46.180]  Right, like every time you move the cursor it moves every time you click it clicks every time you're just typing
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:51.140]  you know, it resists, you know, your touches from your palm or something like that right like and
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:58.060]  Infamously, I mean, I think it's gotten better because I think it's just one of those things that slowly over time people
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:02.580]  You know the other computer makers have gotten better but infamously for a very long time
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:09.100]  PC laptops, even when you bought like a premium one I had to track pads that were just crappy
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.100]  a friend of the show and
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:17.340]  Guest on the last episode Joanna Stern used to write about it all the time and she's a great person to write about it
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:18.980]  because she's
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.980]  She's not really a die-hard
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.940]  Apple user, you know, she's sort of a very what's the word?
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:31.740]  She's just she's universally tech set right and and so she and has used you know
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:39.540]  You've used BlackBerry and Android phones for years before getting an iPhone and had used PCs and Windows sort of open-minded
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:45.540]  I don't know what you want to call it a poly. Yeah poly whatever there's some kind of word that can come after the poly prefix
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:52.100]  But so she's just you know, like I would I'm in a very poor position to judge a PC
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.020]  trackpad because I
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.980]  I'm so lost in Windows and despise windows that I you know, I'm
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:05.260]  It's I'm not a good position for but she is and she wrote so many good columns about why can't other people make a good
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.620]  Trackpad sort of like why can't other people make a 38 inch a 38 millimeter
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.580]  In the same way, I think Apple's keyboards
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.500]  Should be the gold standard of keyboards
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.300]  They did, you know, that's what you get
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.180]  What why you know when when you sell a line of laptops that start at?
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:29.860]  999 dollars which is like three times the starting price of most other companies
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.540]  Like if your laptop and they were you know, if that's the frustrating thing they were for a long time
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:43.060]  So I find it very worrisome because I feel like and I've this is one of my favorite themes is that it's
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:49.420]  Your priorities are not an unordered list. They're an ordered list, right?
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:55.620]  so it's not like you can say our our priorities are a bullet list and the bullets are you
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:58.980]  Know the device looks good
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.860]  There's lightweight is thin feels good works fast
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:08.540]  it matters what order you put these things in and I worry that
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:14.660]  The Johnny I've side of Apple that wants devices to be as thin and elegant as possible
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.380]  has elevated
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.380]  thinness above
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.460]  above the
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.660]  Keyboard should be the best keyboard on the market
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.980]  You know, I think that they should start with let's make the best keyboard on the market
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:34.340]  We'll make it as thin as we can while keeping it the best keyboard on the market
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:40.300]  like that should be the goal make the keyboard as thin as they can while keeping it as as good or better than any keyboard
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.300]  on the market and then
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:45.460]  Decide how thick the overall device has to be after that
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:52.180]  Mm-hmm. Well, and my frustrating thing is that they do do this for things like laptop screens, right?
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:55.900]  the arguably the 13 inch and 15 inch MacBook Pro have
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:03.400]  Beautiful wide color laptop screens and they're very thin and they've they've packed a lot of technology into it
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.400]  Same thing goes for the trackpad
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:12.460]  So there it's not like they're abandoning those core principles. It's just for whatever reason the keyboard seems to have fallen off
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:16.300]  The the importance list. No, it's very true
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:16.860]  Yeah
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:24.500]  another one that to me it the one of the main reasons that the main thing I love about the new MacBook Pros compared to
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:31.260]  My previous generation MacBook Pro that I own is the hinge that the hinge for the display
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:36.820]  Is so much nicer on the new MacBook Pros. It's absolutely amazing
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.460]  And so even though the device is thinner somehow even while making it thinner
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.940]  They designed a way better hinge and part of it
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:45.900]  Is that the whole top that whole display is thinner and it's lighter weight
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:52.900]  But it's like you can move it with just one finger with so little effort, but wherever you leave it it stays
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:00.220]  There's no looseness to it. It doesn't like droop or anything, but you you you move it so lightly
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:06.060]  It's so great and and to me it's one of those things that you can really see how much more care
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:12.200]  Apple puts into the design of its products like the hinges on competing laptops are never as nice as apples
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:19.340]  Mm-hmm without a question because they will again it's something that they've decided that this is important to
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.660]  Put effort into it makes sense, right?
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:28.160]  because they've put so much effort into the screen in recent years that of course you're gonna want a hinge that's going to
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:34.740]  Properly support and display that screen at whatever angle you want to look at it and I can see it where you know
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:41.300]  It is kind of funny and I don't think people would have predicted in fact people didn't really predict
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.560]  you know like it going back like
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:51.140]  50 to 60 years of science fiction of what a computer would look like in the future people didn't really expect them to be sort
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.440]  of fundamentally based on this late
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.220]  19th century technology of the typewriter, right?
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:02.580]  Like it is kind of funny that this device that you know came of age in like
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:04.580]  1870
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:12.340]  Is is that that keyboard is still like a basic part of the
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.780]  human interface of
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:20.660]  modern computers or at least of PC style computers, but it is and there it's it's it's
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.420]  you know you
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:30.300]  For Apple not to prioritize that is foolish and they have this whole other line of computers iPads that
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:36.620]  Skip that, you know, if you want to make a device that is let's skip the keyboard because the keyboard, you know
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.140]  We there's all sorts of use cases where a physical keyboard is
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.620]  Not important. They've got a whole line of computers where they can do whatever they want in that direction
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.660]  but for certain people and some tap, you know some
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:57.100]  Tasks a hardware keyboard is essential and you know the Mac that's why the MacBooks and MacBook Pros still exist
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:02.980]  It's why you know Phil Schiller swears up and down every time he speaks about it in public that the Mac has a bright
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:08.660]  Future as far as Apple can see because they see these use cases where this form factor as a as a future
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:18.740]  Yeah, and I don't know if it's just Apple is not interested in building keyboards because they don't or building
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:23.240]  Fantastic keyboards because they don't see it as the quote-unquote future of the platform
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.920]  Because clearly yes, there are still people who use them and I still use them and you still use them
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.760]  But I I can't help but wonder if they're just like oh, we're so focused on the technology
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:37.920]  That's going to be in our computers five years from now that we're just kind of making do and oh look
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.500]  We made this new butterfly mechanism for your keyboard
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.080]  But we really only made it so that we could make the keyboard thinner
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.640]  We could make a thinner laptop like I don't I that's the pessimist in me
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.680]  I really I don't think that that's truly their internal voicing but it
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:58.440]  It does worry me. It absolutely worries me and it's frustrating because with the exception of the
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.200]  The reliability problems. I actually quite like this keyboard
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:08.560]  I really like this laptop and it's you know, I didn't think that I would ever like a laptop after they you know
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.920]  more or less discontinued the 11-inch MacBook Air and I
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.480]  Really really find myself enjoying this computer computer behalf when I can't I have the 13-inch Pro. That's
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.480]  Yeah, it's perfect
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:29.160]  Yeah, I was just curious if you had the MacBook one, but no I know I've got I've got that touch bar touch bar 13
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:34.920]  No, I and you know, it's a couple people have chimed in about well, then why didn't why did you give it such a good?
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.600]  review and
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.880]  You know, I didn't run into any stuck keys on any of you know
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.240]  The MacBook the new MacBooks I reviewed, you know
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:49.440]  Although I primarily reviewed the exact model you're talking about the touch bar 13-inch because that's the one that I would I would buy
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  If I were to buy one today
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:58.200]  I didn't run into any problems with it and I you know with I could tell within a few days that it was just a
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.760]  For me, it was just a getting used to thing with the keyboard difference
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.180]  Which is has always been the case for me when Apple ships a new style keyboard
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:14.060]  Right, like you never never immediately start touching it and feel right. It's always sort of like no you got to break in, you know
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:20.960]  Mm-hmm. The first time I touched it. I thought I was gonna hate it and I didn't I had an order in for the for the
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.240]  MacBook Pro and I'm like, I don't know if I want to do this
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.820]  I've been using my my iPad Pro for almost the better part of a year as my like sole computer
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:34.660]  And I was like, maybe I'll just get another MacBook Air until I they release something. But no, I got used to it. I
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.700]  Don't know. I've just never
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:39.800]  Never it's totally news to me that
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.600]  Last time like I wrote like the only other I have to go all the way back to 2001
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.840]  To think of an Apple laptop that had a problematic keyboard and that was and it was a device
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:57.000]  I owned it was the iMac g3 that had the the 12-inch computer that had like see-through keys
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.340]  But it wasn't even that it wasn't really reliability it was that they were they just didn't feel good
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:08.360]  They were sort of squishy and yeah, I bought it because I couldn't afford the g4 at the time
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:14.080]  Which was so gorgeous that I'm at the 12-inch g4 with the keyboard that went right up to the edge of the screen
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.640]  But the other problem with the I I didn't really run into this problem
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.640]  But it was sort of notorious that that after a year or so certain people who had the iBook
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:29.800]  G3 the keyboard would start to smell like the the rubber. I swear to God you can like google it the rubber
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.800]  I don't remember this this is yeah
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.920]  You know and it's just one of those things where Apple, you know, maybe they had they didn't know either
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.560]  You know, right because it's like how do you test what this rubber smells like in a year?
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.640]  Like how do you artificially age it by a year?
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.600]  I don't know how that's possible
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:51.060]  But you know, but that's the closest I can think of but even that I'd still rather have a keyboard with a funky smell
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:53.200]  Then I have a keyboard that had a spacebar that didn't work
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.280]  Yeah, or a spacebar that worked intermittently
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.040]  I think that's the the worst problem is that it goes from not working to working to not working
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.880]  So you never know when you open your laptop whether or not you're gonna have a functioning keyboard, right?
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:12.320]  and it's just you know, it does not feel like you own a premium device if like on a regular basis
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.200]  You have to like bang on your R key a couple times really hard to unstick it
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.760]  Like that seems like the sort of thing you expect from like a $300 Chromebook, right?
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.240]  Mm-hmm. So I I don't know that's to me is worrisome
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.560]  Hopefully Apple will get it together
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:34.040]  I mean one thing you know is that there's a ton of people within Apple probably I would guess a vast majority of the company
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.900]  Overwhelming majority of the company who uses MacBooks on a daily basis either at home or at their desk
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.560]  So they must be aware of it. I
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  Assume that we will see a
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.060]  Tweak to the keyboard with the next generation of MacBook pros like I I mean this has been an issue
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:56.180]  Casey's article was excellent, but I mean I first heard people talking about this issue
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:59.280]  I think it was like Steven Hackett was talking about it way back
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.700]  You know right after the the max were introduced and like last last December
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:06.700]  I'm just being like have you guys noticed if your keys are sticking at all?
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.300]  Like my keys are sticking is kind of so this has been a like I have no doubt that the people inside Apple
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.500]  Discover this is a problem pretty early on
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:21.660]  But what can you do really short of saying we're gonna recall all of the MacBook pros and put in new like that's not gonna
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:26.820]  Be possible like they're there. It's basically just a here's your awkward
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.340]  And Jonathan Mann's video is very funny
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:33.020]  You know hold the hold the Mac at 90 degrees and try and spray
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:40.260]  compressed air at 45 degrees and maybe that'll work or if not go to a genius and get your top case or like that it's
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.940]  A pain it's a pain and that's early adoptership for you
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.060]  So hopefully it'll be fixed in the second generation
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:47.540]  I have faith and I do you know
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:52.300]  I know for a fact Apple even talks about it that they have a dedicated keyboard engineering team
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:56.220]  You know, they do take keyboards seriously. So, you know
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:59.220]  Hopefully those guys are hard at work
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:03.760]  Let me thank our last sponsor of the show. It is our good friends at back plays

[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440]  Get a whole backup of everything
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.260]  You can get it restored by
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.400]  Mail, what do I mean? And you know, like you don't have to sit there and download everything
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:58.100]  you can just go there and
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:04.220]  You can purchase a hard drive with all your data on it and have it overnighted by FedEx by tomorrow morning
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.980]  You'll just have a USB hard drive in your hands with all of your data
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:12.100]  And then you can even return the drive to back blaze and get a full refund for it
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.260]  So you're not even paying for the drive if you don't need it
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:20.300]  That's how fast and that's you know, never underestimate the bandwidth of a truck full of hard drives

[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:28.380]  That's a lot of return documents and memories and it's gimmick free
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:33.040]  There are no gimmicks with back blaze where they say well, it's five dollars a month, but then you got to pay
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.420]  You know extra if you have an external hard drive or something like that. Nope

[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.980]  etc for business
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.100]  My thanks to back place
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.220]  I don't have much time left
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:21.020]  But the other thing I wanted to talk about I don't know if you have anything you want to bring up and I want to talk
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:26.260]  About my iOS 11 battery life seems to me seems to me every single year every year
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.020]  new version of iOS hits and
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.780]  some
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:35.980]  Sizable percentage not a majority but some you know, 10 15
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:41.740]  I don't know percent of users in upgrade their old iPhone which may only be a you one-year-old iPhone and
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.440]  All of a sudden their battery life plummets
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:51.840]  And it's absolutely a real phenomenon. I know it. I haven't really experienced it
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.760]  I think and I've since gone back. I'm not using the iPhone 8 review units anymore
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.840]  I've since gone back to my personal year-old iPhone
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.320]  7
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.660]  My battery life on a daily basis is just about roughly the same as it was on iOS 10
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  You know I get into the yellow as I call it at the end of the day
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.960]  But that's on days when I use my phone a lot
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.560]  I've always you know gotten into low power mode at the end of the day if I don't trickle charge, you know
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:25.700]  It's you know a day of heavy use on an iPhone 7 not plus typically, you know
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.700]  That's about what I get one day of battery life
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.640]  And that's about where I am with iOS 11, but it does seem you know
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.360]  I get emails and I don't know if I'm gay
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:39.280]  It seems like I might be getting more from daring fireball readers this year than typical about them
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:47.680]  you know like literally like a year old iPhone 7 and now they have to charge it at lunch because they're running out by like
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.800]  1230 in the afternoon
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.960]  I'm curious
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:57.060]  Curious what you've heard from from I'm or readers. What what your sense of this is
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:05.500]  So I've definitely heard some complaints about battery life. Although mostly coming from folks on older phones on SEs or older
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.500]  For
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:14.000]  Me personally, it's really hard to judge because I think I am an atypical iPhone user which is to say
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:20.980]  2-thirds of the day I end up using my you know, my iPhone 8 plus as like a first of all
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:25.940]  It's my primary computer up until about 11 a.m. Because I'm walking around the house or doing whatever
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:32.360]  So I'm doing a lot of work like legitimate work on my phone and using it the way that I would a laptop
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:40.280]  And then on top of that I often am filming 4k video on it whether that's at practice or whether that's for I'm or
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:48.080]  So I tend to only get like two-thirds of a day or half of a day off of my off of my phone without plugging
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.040]  It in because of the way I use it
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.480]  I don't use it like a normal human and I'm okay with that, but it makes it really hard to
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.480]  Sort of take a look at what other people are saying about battery life and be like, yeah
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.760]  I've seen that because I can't like my my experiences are not gonna to line up but you're right in that
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.040]  I have seen quite a few people on Twitter
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.040]  responding about battery life and and concerns about battery life and I'm not sure whether that's
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.800]  Whether that's just when you upgrade, you know
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:21.240]  You might choose to turn on iCloud backups or whatever and that that might cause some some
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.440]  interference
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.720]  it could just be on it like I don't know that's the it's
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.720]  it's kind of
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:37.600]  Mysterious. I like it's kind of obfuscating what what goes on behind the scenes and in an upgrade especially when it's you know
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.760]  There can be upgrades where everybody's battery life takes just a nosedive
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:45.680]  But this it's this doesn't seem to be what what's happening here. It just seems to be like little
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.360]  anecdotal like
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.520]  People bits and pieces here and there and it's and it's not like all the same phone either
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.720]  It's some people with new phones some people with old phones
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.560]  It's just odd. Yeah, and like I had a
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.960]  friend, you know who
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.560]  emailed me to ask if I've heard anything because he's one of the he's somebody who's
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.160]  Who's having to charge his phone at lunch that it's running down that quickly and
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:19.520]  looked in the battery section of the preferences or the settings where it gives you a list like the blame list of what what apps
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.420]  Have been using your battery over the you know
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:26.480]  Where's your battery life gone over the last 24 hours or the last seven days or whatever?
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.480]  And you know, it was like
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:35.000]  Like messages was at 7% and he was thinking, you know thinking like wow
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.920]  Maybe messages is to blame and it was over and I said to him I was like, you know
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.680]  I looked at mine and messages was at 6%
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:46.480]  you know, like it seems like 6 or 7% from messages with background use is actually, you know normal like
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:54.440]  There was nothing in there that really looked suspicious, you know, and even like his Facebook was low, you know, like, you know it
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:50:01.820]  It I don't know but it's it didn't look like you could tell what it was where it was going from that blameless
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:05.320]  I think though the more dangerous part is it fuels the
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:10.360]  Widespread conspiracy theory that Apple purposefully makes battery life bad
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:16.980]  I mean a lot of people believe this on upgrades on upgrade to force people to force people to upgrade to a new machine
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.980]  Which is so it's crazy for a couple of reasons one it
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:26.100]  Why would you
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:30.400]  Wouldn't wouldn't that lead if if your battery life is bad on your year-old phone
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.300]  wouldn't that it'd be a main reason for you to consider switching to Android like
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.260]  It's counterintuitive to me
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.100]  I mean, I know that there are some people who would never can you know?
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.180]  They're so so tied to Apple that they're gonna do it
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:50.420]  But if it literally was the case that you thought the company was sabotaging your device, wouldn't that make you reconsider your allegiances?
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.660]  To personally I know people who work at Apple
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:55.820]  I don't know a sing
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:59.460]  I I don't know a single engineer who I know at Apple who if they were told
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:06.280]  put something in here to make to make you know, everything other than the iPhone 8 and iPhone 10
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:12.140]  Run slower or use more battery life. They would quit. I mean, I swear to God they would quit and
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:20.780]  Yeah, because they're the people I know at Apple, you know are there to do good work and guess what in California if you're you know
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.580]  Good enough to work as an engineer at Apple
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:28.780]  You can you be hired by the time you get to your car after you packed up your office to quit you'd have job offers
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:32.360]  In your hand, so it's not like they feel like they you know
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:38.220]  Like they're trapped at Apple because they can't get a job somewhere else. But literally, I mean the people I know who work there would
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:43.040]  Refuse to do it. They'd probably go above their supervisor and report them for you know
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:49.760]  Suggesting something so idiotic. Mm-hmm. So it's certainly not purposeful
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:53.400]  No, and it actually makes me think about
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.680]  The watch OS 4 and the fact that series 0 like original Apple watch owners didn't get
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:06.120]  one of the features which is the first time this has happened in a watch OS update where they didn't get the
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.140]  All of the heart rate tracking features that have that have come to watch OS 4
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:17.200]  And a lot of series 0 people are you know, I saw some complaints about that, but then right next to it
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:22.880]  I saw some I feel like my watch is slower now that it's on watch OS 4 and I'm like
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.440]  I just I wish she would connect these two things and
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:33.560]  Understand that like the only reason why features get or at least I would think the primary reason why features get taken away on older
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:39.900]  Devices is not because Apple wants you to upgrade to a new device like they might want you to but that's not that's not the
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:45.740]  Right way of going about it. What they're doing is making sure that the feature performs correctly, right?
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.180]  It's like you don't want you know, it's the opposite right? It's they're actually like we're not gonna give you this feature
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.180]  That's going to run your battery down
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:57.400]  Mm-hmm, exactly, right? Like there's certain photography features that are only in the new ones because all that they
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.980]  To get the performance Apple needs they depend upon the new
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.180]  Digital image
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500]  What do you call it?
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:12.020]  The image signal processor the you know custom in other words the custom to the new the new silicon
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:14.820]  So, I don't know
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:20.980]  Well, I'm curious my best guess as to what what the blame is and maybe this is why it's a yearly thing
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:25.180]  Is that they're all a bunch. It's a bunch of edge cases right things that didn't turn up
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:27.180]  it's that's why it doesn't affect everybody and
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:34.540]  It's the nature of the fact that the new version of iOS has to ship in mid-september come hell or high water
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:40.580]  Right like and it's you know, and so I'm curious whether people out there
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.260]  I'd love to hear from you if you've had bad battery life with iOS 11.0 and
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:49.780]  The point one update was just a minor bug fix
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:53.860]  But like when I the next like software update to iOS 11 comes out
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.780]  I'd be very curious to hear how many people have their perform
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:01.780]  You know battery performance issues fixed because I suspect it's just a whole bunch of bug bugs
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:08.740]  And that's the sort of thing that once it's out in the wild and everybody who's opted into sending Apple the diagnostics
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:14.600]  Apple can you know fixed all those bugs thanks to the diagnostics that get sent in?
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.700]  That's my guess. Yeah. No, I I agree
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:24.220]  I think it's because it's so widespread on the or not. No, sir widespread because the device
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:30.180]  Options are so widespread. I tend to agree. I think it's a bunch of education and a bunch of people who are
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.780]  God all I want to say is you're using it wrong, but that's not true. I
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.380]  I
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:41.020]  Have one more thing. I'd like to talk about very quickly. Is there anything you wanted to bring up?
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:44.260]  No, I mean I think
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.140]  Yeah, let's let's let's talk another time about Apple watch
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.580]  That's too deep a topic that's another show it's quick
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.100]  this is quick is
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:59.540]  The question of this is a debate that Jason Snell and I and a couple other people had on Twitter
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:03.720]  That was pretty interesting last week is how is Apple going to distribute their original content?
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.380]  meaning the TV and movies that they're that they're producing like
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:12.900]  The I'm so looking forward to it that they signed a deal with Steven Spielberg to reboot amazing
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.540]  Which is one of my all-time favorite shows from the 80s
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.380]  so good
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.300]  and
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:27.500]  Basically, I see the options as that they just include them with Apple music. So you pay for one subscription service
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:31.460]  It's called Apple music and it includes TV and movies
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:36.380]  Which seems weird, but I think that that's possible that remember
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:42.660]  this is the company that has an app called iTunes that does everything from your movies and TV shows to
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:47.700]  Managing your iPhone software restores up until the last version
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:51.140]  So and then back again if you want, right?
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:56.900]  And they used to call the the store where you bought the movies was called the iTunes music store for a while
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:01.420]  It's still called iTunes, right it
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:07.900]  So I the company has a history of not being afraid to use a very music centric
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.580]  brand name for
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.580]  Content that includes TV and movies
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.260]  Jason's of the opinion that they're gonna sell it separately that they will be like something called Apple video or something
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:24.060]  I think video is sort of a weird word for that though because music is an art form and video is a technology
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.840]  So I think it's hard to come up Apple watch, right?
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.200]  Would be good but it's taken all right
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:40.440]  You know, I I think that the you know, it makes sense and Apple does love to chart make money
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.160]  And so charging for two separate things, you know is a way to bump up
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:50.320]  Sales, but I think they can just make tons of money just by getting more and more people to sign up for one subscription service
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.840]  Whether it stays named Apple music or they rename it to something else
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:02.080]  And here's why I think it would be hard to get the video because it it's it's sort of like the slowly boiling frog
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.920]  It's like they're not going to suddenly have this huge library of video content that they can charge $10 a month for right?
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:13.680]  Like let's say they come out with the first good series output. Let's say amazing stories comes out next year
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:20.960]  Mm-hmm. Now they've got one one good series. Well, how are they gonna charge $10 a month when they'll hold?
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.500]  It's just what did one TV show no matter how good this is
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:29.600]  Yeah, this is the debate people were having about CBS all access with discovery
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.280]  But you know CBS all access does have other shows
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:39.260]  It just happens to be the discovery is like the only the only one that I think most people of our age group want to
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:43.400]  Watch is it true is it but with Apple is it the case that I have to sign up for that if I want to?
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.340]  Watch the new Star Trek. There's no other I can't I can't buy the new Star Trek on iTunes
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:54.120]  That I don't know actually but it's entirely possible. I know there was I ran into to one
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:58:00.360]  One show that I was really excited about watching and couldn't watch because because I'm in Canada
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.640]  And then I went to look at it on on iTunes that I couldn't find it
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.520]  But I actually don't know if you can't buy discovery
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:12.360]  I think there's a slowly boiling frog problem here where I feel like if they it you know when there's only one show
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:18.220]  As it is right now with carpool karaoke and and the the app game show
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.600]  That they're just giving them with Apple music
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.560]  I feel like even once a good show comes out, you know
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:30.600]  You can foresee a future five years from now where Apple is spending ten billion dollars a year on original content
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.360]  and they have ten good shows and they have
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:39.440]  The their own feature films you could you could and you can imagine them having something that's worth
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:44.800]  $10 a month just for that alone, but to get from here to there at at what point
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:50.120]  Is it worth it? And at the beginning I feel like they have to bundle it with Apple music
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.520]  But then even at the point where they have a bunch of shows, what do they do then take it away from Apple music?
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.560]  yeah, I honestly I think the way that they
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:05.180]  The the the easiest way that I can see it happening is doing it as almost like a component service
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:11.020]  We're almost getting back to cable here. I think that you're gonna have your Apple music subscription
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:13.740]  But you're gonna be able to have an add-on basically for video
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:20.280]  Kind of like the way that Netflix does for like regular Netflix in HD or 4k Netflix where it's just like it's a little bit
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:25.260]  Pricier I see that it's like Apple music then Apple music and Apple video
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:28.720]  Right where it's just the the two of the things together
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:35.580]  Then there's the the other part of me that's still wondering if Apple's trying to pull together
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:43.700]  Away, so that we're not paying for 10 $10 a month subscription services. So I don't know about you but like my my subscription
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:52.320]  My list of subscriptions is getting a little crazy because I've got Hulu. I've got CBS. I've got HBO. I've got AMC of God knows
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:59.120]  I got and and we're just the CW. Yeah, it's like Hulu's commercials are so goddamn annoying that we're
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:05.280]  Haven't done it yet, but I'm on the cusp of upgrading from the 999 plan to the 1299 plan
[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.300]  The commercial for your commercial limited, right?
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.320]  Yeah, yeah, and oh and I also have season passes for things like mr. Robot in in iTunes
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.920]  So it's a it's a whole it's a whole mass of things
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.360]  I could I really depending on what you're why I really could see them just adding it to Apple music
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.800]  Period and then slowly upgrade updating, you know
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:33.420]  Raising the price of Apple music and not even having just keeping the two tiers as single-person family
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.200]  But raising maybe the yeah, maybe the baseline goes from 999 to 1299
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.360]  I mean Netflix is doing that Netflix is slowly but surely raising the price of their monthly
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.520]  Subscription
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.640]  Mm-hmm. I don't know. I just don't see it being a totally separate thing
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:53.920]  I really I think but I could see it but I think it would be such an appley thing to do is to just
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.680]  Have all this amazing TV content, you know in a service called Apple music
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:04.480]  I really do I do think that that's an appley thing to do like they're they're weird with names
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:14.040]  Yeah, although I also look at this as this is the company that a couple years ago split iTunes into music and
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.320]  Video and or will now I guess TV
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  And
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:25.880]  You know all these different little mini apps so depends on which which portion of marketing is taking control of this
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:32.160]  Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, my thanks to you Randy. I got to wrap this up. Let's let's call it a show
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.400]  Yeah, everybody can follow your your work at I'm more
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.840]  And on on the Twitter's you are what's your Twitter name?
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:48.840]  I'm set urn s e t t e r n which is a great follow. So my thanks to you
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:52.160]  Have fun getting married
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:56.640]  Thanks, here's here's hoping that none of us explode in the next ten days
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:11.280]  All right, thanks
