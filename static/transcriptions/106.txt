[00:00.000 --> 00:17.600]  So, uh, I don't know how well this is going to work.
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.600]  I don't know.
[00:18.600 --> 00:21.200]  I went to the last time I've had more than one person on the show, probably when I was
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.200]  on stage at WWDC.
[00:22.200 --> 00:24.200]  It'll work out fine.
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.200]  You'll see.
[00:25.200 --> 00:26.200]  It'll work out fine.
[00:26.200 --> 00:27.200]  It'll be fine.
[00:27.200 --> 00:28.200]  Yeah.
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.200]  That's what I thought.
[00:29.200 --> 00:32.000]  Before we get the gist of it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.160]  My basic gist, though, is let's shoot the shit on Star Wars for two hours.
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.160]  Movies.
[00:38.160 --> 00:39.160]  So, you know what's funny?
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.000]  Before you, uh, before you said this, I wanted to tell you to do the Christmas Spectacular
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.400]  again this year, except then actually have a guess.
[00:45.400 --> 00:50.320]  I thought about, and it's actually, it's just scooping the lip.
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.320]  And it's actually Syracuse.
[00:52.320 --> 00:53.320]  Well, that's what it is.
[00:53.320 --> 00:57.080]  Here we are, making up for last year, where it was a total sham.
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.880]  And I was surprising amount of email from people who told me that we must have screwed
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.680]  up the editing because we cut it off before John or Marco made it on.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.280]  Well, I mean, they were a little bit in the bag.
[01:08.280 --> 01:10.080]  They weren't really ready for the stage, right?
[01:10.080 --> 01:11.080]  No.
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.080]  And poor molds.
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.080]  Poor molds.
[01:13.080 --> 01:14.080]  Poor molds.
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.480]  And his wife had to drive him home and back.
[01:16.480 --> 01:17.880]  It was not a pretty scene.
[01:17.880 --> 01:25.680]  So, have you guys done, John, you're on the incomparable semi-frequently frequently?
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.680]  Pretty frequently.
[01:27.680 --> 01:29.680]  Have you done Star Wars on the incomparable?
[01:29.680 --> 01:32.680]  You obviously don't listen to the show.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.680]  I don't listen to anybody's shows.
[01:34.680 --> 01:35.680]  Yeah, no.
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.680]  We have done all of the Star Wars movies, the original Star Wars movies.
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.680]  And we've done episode one and two for the prequels.
[01:44.680 --> 01:47.680]  But the Star Wars holiday special.
[01:47.680 --> 01:49.680]  See, I've never seen that.
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.680]  Guy, have you seen the Star Wars holiday special?
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.680]  No, I don't want to.
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.680]  Yeah.
[01:54.680 --> 01:55.680]  I think it's the incomparable one.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.680]  Don't watch it.
[01:56.680 --> 01:57.680]  Don't watch it.
[01:57.680 --> 01:58.680]  Yeah.
[01:58.680 --> 01:59.680]  I feel exactly the same way you did, John.
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.680]  Like, you sort of took one for the team there and now to watch it.
[02:03.680 --> 02:04.680]  Yeah.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.680]  If I can possibly avoid it.
[02:05.680 --> 02:09.680]  This is Jason's revenge for me making him watch hours and hours of anime and try to play
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.240]  video games just to make the Star Wars holiday special.
[02:12.240 --> 02:18.680]  A couple of years ago, one of the sites published a, like, what do they call them now?
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.680]  Explainers?
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.400]  You know, like, this concept of an explainer, which I kind of like, it's sort of like
[02:23.400 --> 02:27.400]  a blog post crossed with like a Wikipedia entry.
[02:27.400 --> 02:28.400]  Well, here's an exercise.
[02:28.400 --> 02:33.720]  Try to think of, pretend the word explainer doesn't exist and then try to think of another
[02:33.720 --> 02:40.640]  phrase or summary or description of what we now know as an explainer.
[02:40.640 --> 02:43.760]  Because whenever I do it, I come out with something that's insulting.
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.760]  Hmm.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.760]  What would it be?
[02:45.760 --> 02:46.760]  I'm not sure.
[02:46.760 --> 02:47.760]  I don't know.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.760]  I don't know.
[02:48.760 --> 02:49.760]  It's like, I mean, I'm falling back.
[02:49.760 --> 02:50.760]  I'm like, the four dummies things or whatever.
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.920]  Simplify this to the point where it seems understandable, but what you're actually coming
[02:55.920 --> 02:59.840]  away from the article with is not a true understanding of the subject because it's really
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.840]  complicated.
[03:00.840 --> 03:03.840]  Let me take a complicated thing and make it really simple.
[03:03.840 --> 03:08.880]  Let me like, it just, I don't know, explainers, I understand why you, but some people are
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.240]  attracted to the concept, but the actual articles I've read that are described as explainers
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.240]  just leave me angry.
[03:14.240 --> 03:15.240]  Yeah.
[03:15.240 --> 03:20.560]  Like overview, maybe it's a good word summary, executive summary, overview, like
[03:20.560 --> 03:25.200]  it's not much, I don't know, like whenever I read something that's described as an explainer,
[03:25.200 --> 03:29.400]  it's just like, you know, because no one, like if there's an article in the Atlantic or
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.520]  something, nobody calls it an explainer, like an article is supposed to explain things.
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.440]  Once you call it an explainer, that's like code for, oh, we're not actually going to get
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.120]  the real, anyway, I'm unreasonably angry about explainer.
[03:40.120 --> 03:41.120]  Go on.
[03:41.120 --> 03:42.120]  I dropped it.
[03:42.120 --> 03:43.120]  Yeah.
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.800]  Well, I remember, I remember that I appreciated was one from Vox.com on, I don't know if it was
[03:48.800 --> 03:54.880]  Benghazi or one of these things where it, it seemed like I would have had to read 20 articles
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.880]  to catch up and it didn't make any sense.
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.880]  And I read their quote unquote explainer and it kind of figure, I figured the whole thing
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.760]  out because, you know, in the gist of the explainer, they're like, this is really nothing,
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.360]  it's really just political with you.
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.040]  See, well, they just did just call that the news that you were watching.
[04:12.040 --> 04:17.120]  It would tell you a summary of what's going on and, well, anyway, somebody wrote an explainer
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.560]  on the Star Wars holiday special and it had just enough screen caps where I was like,
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.360]  holy cow, it really is worse than the terrible reputation would have you believe.
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.840]  And so I knew I never had to watch it.
[04:27.840 --> 04:28.840]  Yeah.
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.400]  And not only that, as I said in the, in the uncomfortable thing, it's not even the type
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.440]  of thing, if you care about Star Wars at all that you can watch and be like, ah, laugh at
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.840]  this, it's so bad, you know what I mean?
[04:36.840 --> 04:37.840]  You can't even do that.
[04:37.840 --> 04:39.520]  It's just, it's just bad.
[04:39.520 --> 04:40.680]  It's just, it's not fun.
[04:40.680 --> 04:41.680]  It's not interesting.
[04:41.680 --> 04:43.680]  And if you care about Star Wars, it will hurt you.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.680]  All right.
[04:44.680 --> 04:53.320]  So we're having a holiday special and we're talking about Star Wars, but it has nothing
[04:53.320 --> 04:59.160]  to do with the Star Wars, Star Wars holiday spectacular or whatever they call it.
[04:59.160 --> 05:02.280]  Um, not yet, not yet at least.
[05:02.280 --> 05:03.280]  All right.
[05:03.280 --> 05:05.680]  And also I only want to talk about the movies.
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.680]  I, the whole expanded universe thing is a pilot crap as far as I'm concerned.
[05:09.680 --> 05:10.680]  Yeah.
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.320]  Not in mind the cartoons as much, but I don't.
[05:13.320 --> 05:14.320]  They're a different thing.
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.560]  I mean, like if the movies are like a good steak dinner, they're kind of like a beef jerky
[05:18.560 --> 05:21.840]  that you'd buy at a corner store, like they're, you know what I mean?
[05:21.840 --> 05:25.360]  They're meat, but you know, not really the same kind of thing.
[05:25.360 --> 05:30.480]  Have you watched all of the, the cartoons Clone Wars and now the Star Wars Rebels?
[05:30.480 --> 05:31.480]  I have.
[05:31.480 --> 05:35.520]  And there's some, there's some things to commend them, there's some Star Warsy stuff.
[05:35.520 --> 05:41.160]  But I, I don't see how they could possibly fit into the, to the story that the movies
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.520]  are telling in any sensible way.
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.440]  I mean, I, I actually feel the same way, but the people, so, you know, but, you know, if
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.840]  you know, and then they let up a lightsaber and fun stuff happens.
[05:50.840 --> 05:54.440]  Well, there's spin-offs in the traditional sense where it's like, all right, well, make
[05:54.440 --> 05:58.680]  a TV show out of the movies and it's in the same universe and it's, it's more or less
[05:58.680 --> 06:04.720]  fits in the same timeline, but there's no specific expectation that they feel are behave
[06:04.720 --> 06:09.600]  exactly like the movie because they're not there and animated television show as opposed
[06:09.600 --> 06:10.600]  to movies.
[06:10.600 --> 06:13.600]  What, what, and for what they are, they're actually pretty decent.
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.640]  Wasn't the original premise for Star Wars Rebels though that it would be live action?
[06:18.640 --> 06:25.320]  There was talk of a live action Star Wars TV series a very long time ago, around about
[06:25.320 --> 06:28.240]  the time I think the prequels were either in the process of being made or before they
[06:28.240 --> 06:32.360]  were made and that seemed to fall by the wayside it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't work
[06:32.360 --> 06:35.680]  out for whatever reason I forget what the actual situation was.
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.800]  And more recently, I've heard the idea of it coming back up again.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.120]  I'm not opposed to such a thing.
[06:41.120 --> 06:48.120]  I think it would be cool, but Clone Wars, the computer animated one was kind of weird because
[06:48.120 --> 06:53.600]  there was another animated thing called the Clone Wars that was cell animated as opposed
[06:53.600 --> 06:54.600]  to CG.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.600]  Which was great.
[06:55.600 --> 07:00.280]  Yeah, that was very interesting and all of them very different stylistic choices than
[07:00.280 --> 07:01.280]  the movie.
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.480]  Wait, when was this?
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.440]  Around about the prequels, around about the time of maybe I guess episode two or something,
[07:07.440 --> 07:08.440]  it was cell animated.
[07:08.440 --> 07:10.240]  It was before episode two.
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.040]  Very stylized, kind of look like Samurai Jack, I don't know if it was the same guy, it
[07:14.040 --> 07:15.040]  was the same guy.
[07:15.040 --> 07:16.040]  Yeah.
[07:16.040 --> 07:17.040]  And it was great.
[07:17.040 --> 07:24.080]  And you know what, it ends with, it ends with the opening scene from episode two.
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.820]  The end of that arc of that animation arc ends with the invasion of, or the, the cell
[07:28.820 --> 07:32.360]  to the croissant from the, from the bad game.
[07:32.360 --> 07:35.880]  Grievous as Grievous is arc from Grievous, his army, yeah, shows up and they, they kidnapped
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.200]  the, the, the, the chance.
[07:37.200 --> 07:38.200]  Yeah.
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.560]  But that's the, the final episode.
[07:39.560 --> 07:43.880]  Is it in the cell shaded one or the CG one where you learn why general Grievous is all
[07:43.880 --> 07:44.880]  wheezy and everything?
[07:44.880 --> 07:51.560]  It's the shelf shaded, the shelf shaded, so are these things about how come I'm not aware
[07:51.560 --> 07:52.560]  of this?
[07:52.560 --> 07:54.920]  Because you're, you kids are kind of the right age.
[07:54.920 --> 07:55.920]  I don't know the cell shaded one.
[07:55.920 --> 07:59.640]  I don't, I don't think Jonas was born yet, but because I saw that, it wasn't, it certainly
[07:59.640 --> 08:02.880]  wasn't as big as the clone, but Clone Wars might, my son watch me.
[08:02.880 --> 08:03.880]  What was it called?
[08:03.880 --> 08:04.880]  Clone Wars.
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.880]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[08:05.880 --> 08:06.880]  They're both called Clone Wars.
[08:06.880 --> 08:07.880]  Yeah.
[08:07.880 --> 08:10.360]  And I think, well, here's the thing, I think you actually had to be a bit of an animation
[08:10.360 --> 08:13.760]  nerd to get into it or to hear about it.
[08:13.760 --> 08:14.760]  That's right.
[08:14.760 --> 08:15.760]  Like, how did you hear about it, John?
[08:15.760 --> 08:18.480]  I've got a more quick time movies and I don't know from when stuff, quick time movies
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.080]  came, but that's how I watched it.
[08:20.080 --> 08:22.480]  Do you think I'm going to be able to get these on iTunes or something?
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.480]  I doubt it.
[08:23.480 --> 08:25.320]  I would have found it by now, right?
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.360]  The CG Clone Wars has got to be available for us.
[08:27.360 --> 08:28.360]  Oh, yeah, CG is.
[08:28.360 --> 08:32.160]  I've, I've, I've seen I, I, I, I too am, I'm completely caught up.
[08:32.160 --> 08:34.160]  I've seen every episode of the Clone Wars.
[08:34.160 --> 08:39.360]  I saw the, the article release, which is really just a two hour episode of the movie or
[08:39.360 --> 08:41.320]  the TV show.
[08:41.320 --> 08:45.040]  And just recently caught up, Jonas and I caught up on the, I get, I think there's only
[08:45.040 --> 08:47.360]  seven episodes so far as Star Wars rebels, right?
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.360]  Yeah.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.360]  I believe so.
[08:49.360 --> 08:51.840]  Well, if that's the case, then I'm caught up.
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.480]  I like the way that the rebels TV show is, doesn't feature any of the characters from
[08:56.480 --> 08:57.480]  the feature films.
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.760]  Yeah, but it's very clearly in the world and it's creeping up on a new hope timeline.
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.360]  So you start seeing tie fighters look like tie fighters and, you know, the kind of rebels
[09:06.360 --> 09:10.160]  in the empire in more or less the shapes that you would have expected.
[09:10.160 --> 09:11.560]  But, you know, it's a totally different thing.
[09:11.560 --> 09:15.000]  It's a, you know, different cast of characters doing different things within the same
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  universe.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.960]  And it's, there's a bit of a, sorry, finished that.
[09:19.960 --> 09:23.600]  There's a bit of awareness in it that their Jedi is running around.
[09:23.600 --> 09:26.840]  Whereas as of new hope, we know that there's, well, at least you're to believe that there's
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.400]  no other Jedi in hiding.
[09:29.400 --> 09:31.200]  I mean, you got, you're going to have a Star Wars show.
[09:31.200 --> 09:33.760]  It's a good idea to have some Jedi's and some white saber's.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.760]  Oh, yeah.
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.640]  In terms of the narrative to us, yes, for sure.
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.840]  But I mean, it kind of goes against what we heard of Luke being the last Jedi, right?
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.480]  Yeah, that's what Yoda says on his deathbed and our, no, wait, does it empire or is it
[09:45.480 --> 09:47.240]  returning to the Jedi when he's dying?
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.120]  Might be returning to the Jedi when he's dying and he says something to the effect of, you
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.520]  know, in 10 seconds from now when I die, he'd last to the Jedi, you will be.
[09:56.520 --> 09:57.520]  Yeah.
[09:57.520 --> 10:00.520]  He will last the, he will last the credited Jedi.
[10:00.520 --> 10:01.520]  Okay.
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.520]  That's true.
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.520]  Good.
[10:05.520 --> 10:11.320]  So there's something new that I have to learn, but see, I don't know my way around the, the
[10:11.320 --> 10:12.320]  underground internet.
[10:12.320 --> 10:14.520]  So I don't know how I'm going to get these cell enemies.
[10:14.520 --> 10:15.520]  Yeah.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.520]  I made them once at there.
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.080]  So I said I haven't been quick time movies.
[10:18.080 --> 10:20.520]  They're probably like 320 by 200.
[10:20.520 --> 10:21.520]  I know.
[10:21.520 --> 10:24.640]  It's like postage stamps, you know, like what cook time used to look like.
[10:24.640 --> 10:30.480]  I remember when that was the big size, I remember when 160 by, yeah, 120 was the, was
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.480]  the regular size.
[10:31.480 --> 10:32.480]  It's in a pack compression.
[10:32.480 --> 10:33.480]  It's high fidelity though.
[10:33.480 --> 10:35.200]  So it'll look great.
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.640]  Well, I'm surprised though that that didn't, wasn't like a bigger deal.
[10:40.640 --> 10:46.720]  Well, anyway, and what I understand is with the Disney purchase of Lucasfilm and the, the,
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.840]  the archive and I talked mentioned this with Wesker's a couple of weeks ago that they're,
[10:50.840 --> 10:54.160]  they're more or less saying with this movie, all those novels and shit that you've been
[10:54.160 --> 10:55.160]  reading for 20 years.
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.160]  That's all out the door.
[10:56.160 --> 11:00.760]  We're not looking at any of that and, you know, none of that's canon anymore.
[11:00.760 --> 11:01.760]  Yeah.
[11:01.760 --> 11:04.240]  They have to do that because if they're going to make it chronologically after returning
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.240]  to the Jedi, the expanded universe has like told all those stories like 20 times over like
[11:08.240 --> 11:10.560]  we know what happens to all the characters that we love.
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.520]  There's told all their bad guys and good guys and like they just run it out.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.400]  So if you can't put anything chronologically after Jedi unless you either do exactly what
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.560]  happened in the books, which would probably be a bad idea, or put it way, way, way past
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.080]  where the books go or something and then say, okay, it's the distant distant, you know,
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.080]  it's way past.
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.120]  And, and it was always called expanded universe.
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.840]  So I think this is the only possible way to make a movie with the original actors.
[11:33.840 --> 11:36.680]  You just got to say, forget about the books.
[11:36.680 --> 11:37.680]  Yeah.
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.160]  I, I think there's a, there's a problem with fetishizing the canon, right?
[11:41.160 --> 11:43.600]  Like it's going to ham string your story.
[11:43.600 --> 11:46.880]  Just go tell good movie stories and just don't worry about the rest.
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.200]  Doesn't mean you can't read those books and have fun, but you know, you don't need them
[11:50.200 --> 11:54.560]  to be in the exact same canonically universe, really.
[11:54.560 --> 12:01.160]  Um, yeah, and I, I only read the first of those books, the, the first one with the grand
[12:01.160 --> 12:02.160]  admiral.
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.160]  The Timothy's on.
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.120]  Yeah, it was, it was so bad, you know, it, it kept me from ever reading anymore.
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.080]  But I, I at least am enough aware of what happened that it, and one, I, you know, I saw
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.840]  the headlines that in one of the novels, Chewbacca gets killed and you know, there's
[12:16.840 --> 12:21.000]  no way they're not bringing Chewbacca back in the new movie.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.960]  Everyone does eventually.
[12:22.960 --> 12:25.720]  Yeah, but if they're going to kill them, they're going to kill them in the movie.
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.600]  They're not going to, they're not going to just say, well, I sure miss Chewbacca.
[12:29.600 --> 12:30.600]  Yeah.
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.720]  Like they did in, uh, like they did in last crusade where they just kind of panned over
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.000]  to a picture of Sean Connery on, on his desk, yeah, because they couldn't get them to
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  do the movie.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  You mean, uh, indie four?
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  Oh, indie four, indie four.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  I'm sorry.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.120]  Well, that piece of crap was, what, whatever, yeah, I know that piece of crap was.
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.720]  I always, I like to pretend that that movie didn't happen.
[12:54.720 --> 12:55.720]  Yeah.
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.720]  It didn't happen.
[12:56.720 --> 12:57.720]  They don't know.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.520]  It happened in the same screwed up universe with the people's day.
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.680]  Well, so episode seven, potentially, it is in the same kind of danger zone, because everyone
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.840]  was excited about indie four for a long time and they couldn't get the principles together
[13:08.840 --> 13:12.960]  to do it by the time they did Harrison four was really old, and it was like, hmm, you
[13:12.960 --> 13:14.040]  know, I don't know if they can pull itself.
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.600]  So here we have, I mean, it works out a little bit better here because I think chronologically
[13:18.600 --> 13:21.680]  speaking, everyone is more comfortable with the actors being the age they're supposed
[13:21.680 --> 13:22.680]  to be in episode seven.
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.480]  It's like, how many years of business currently did I?
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.360]  Well, that's exactly how much older you're supposed to be.
[13:26.360 --> 13:27.360]  So you're fine.
[13:27.360 --> 13:28.360]  Nobody make up.
[13:28.360 --> 13:29.840]  This is what you look like when you're the stage.
[13:29.840 --> 13:30.840]  Fine.
[13:30.840 --> 13:36.640]  Um, and, and the other thing too, I can, the same point is there's clearly going to be
[13:36.640 --> 13:45.200]  a cast of 20 to 30 something heroes and villains who will be in major roles to do that's
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.200]  sort of running and jumping and falling stuff that you need to not shy a little bit.
[13:51.200 --> 13:52.200]  Right.
[13:52.200 --> 13:53.200]  Right.
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.000]  So that the, you know, the classic characters can all sort of take on the roles of like
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.120]  Obi-Wan's and Grand Moff Tarkin's and just be there, be there that fear though.
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.120]  Like when they said, I guess what everybody's coming back, it's like, oh, jeez, everybody's
[14:05.120 --> 14:10.040]  coming back and you start to worry that like, it's going to be like their last hurrah and
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.360]  yeah, they'll be these young actors, but like, it'll be a movie for the old stirs and
[14:14.360 --> 14:18.160]  they'll transition to the youngsters during the movie that, that was the fear.
[14:18.160 --> 14:20.880]  Like you're going to make his old guys run around for as long as you've got them and you'll
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.520]  kill some of them off or they'll kind of, you know, pass the baton and the next movie
[14:25.520 --> 14:26.960]  will be really about the youngsters.
[14:26.960 --> 14:32.360]  But like, like what they, like what they did with Obi-Wan in the Phantom Menace, yeah, kind
[14:32.360 --> 14:33.360]  of.
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.520]  Well, it's like you're, we're going to introduce what's going to be one of the flagship
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.320]  characters of the whole six movie series, Obi-Wan Kenobi and then we'll just spend the
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.400]  entire middle hour of the movie with him waiting on a spaceship in the desert.
[14:46.400 --> 14:47.400]  Yeah.
[14:47.400 --> 14:51.240]  Or like, I mean, you just didn't know who the, because we know so little, but at least
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.800]  I know so little about the movie because I've been avoiding spoilers that just based on
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.600]  the casting alone, you say, well, given this cast, I can make a movie mostly about the
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.840]  old people and about the idea of like now they're past their prime and they're passing
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.360]  a baton that's a new generation, but this is there like one last heist or whatever, you
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.360]  know, if you want to use the, another movie cliche or you could do a movie entirely about
[15:10.360 --> 15:13.880]  the young people and these guys are just in supporting roles and they, they're brief glimpses
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.360]  of them or whatever.
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.560]  I still know what kind of movie it's going to be, but based on the trailer, there's no
[15:18.560 --> 15:19.960]  old faces in a trailer at all.
[15:19.960 --> 15:21.600]  So there's a clear signal right out of the gate.
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.600]  It says, I know we've got all these great people, but this is a movie about these youngsters
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.120]  and here they all are on the trailer and we're not even going to show you any of the other
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.120]  people.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.120]  Yeah.
[15:31.120 --> 15:32.120]  Yeah.
[15:32.120 --> 15:33.120]  Somebody.
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.360]  Well, I, I'm going to get answer, it's, it's got to be their honor, Lando, right?
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.200]  I'm sure we've got the lights about, I'm going to do it, I'm just going to give us
[15:41.200 --> 15:42.200]  orders.
[15:42.200 --> 15:43.200]  Yeah.
[15:43.200 --> 15:44.200]  I don't know.
[15:44.200 --> 15:45.200]  Fly casual.
[15:45.200 --> 15:48.640]  It's a great lot.
[15:48.640 --> 15:49.640]  Yeah.
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.680]  So I mean, starting out with our anticipation of, of the Force Awakens is as good a place
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.880]  as any, because it's really what motivated me to do the show, you know, to get me excited
[15:58.880 --> 16:00.600]  about Star Wars again too.
[16:00.600 --> 16:09.680]  And the, the severe let down, I would describe Indy for as more of a let down than even
[16:09.680 --> 16:10.680]  the Phantom Madness.
[16:10.680 --> 16:12.320]  I would, I would not describe it.
[16:12.320 --> 16:13.320]  I disagree.
[16:13.320 --> 16:14.320]  Yeah.
[16:14.320 --> 16:15.320]  Wait, you would not disagree?
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.320]  You think, you know, I would not disagree.
[16:16.320 --> 16:23.560]  No, it's episode one is the biggest cinematic disappointment of our generation, because
[16:23.560 --> 16:30.560]  it's just the massive anticipation and like we, it was promised, it was foretold
[16:30.560 --> 16:31.560]  right?
[16:31.560 --> 16:35.400]  We wanted to know what happened in this whole, you know, how, how did Anna can turn into Darth
[16:35.400 --> 16:36.400]  Vader?
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.400]  What's the whole deal?
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.440]  You know, like, we wanted to know, we were promised like a nine movie arc in the fan magazines
[16:41.440 --> 16:43.040]  for so long.
[16:43.040 --> 16:46.320]  And we waited and waited, whereas Indy for it was like, I suppose they could make another
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.000]  Indy movie, but if they never make another one, I feel satisfied that the arc of Indy,
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.720]  you know, they had three good movies, well, two good movies and the movie that was okay.
[16:55.720 --> 16:56.720]  And that's fine.
[16:56.720 --> 17:01.880]  It weren't aching to know something that has been talked about or alluded to for the
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.120]  entire run of the series.
[17:03.120 --> 17:05.920]  So whether or not they made another Indy for you would have been satisfied with Star Wars
[17:05.920 --> 17:09.960]  was just massively anticipated with the huge gap in between.
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.080]  And the disappointment, I think, was even more crushing because I've only seen Indy
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.960]  for once, but my recollection is it was not as incompetently made as Phantom.
[17:17.960 --> 17:19.440]  It's, it's like, it's pretty bad.
[17:19.440 --> 17:20.760]  It's like the Johnny Danger's Lee joke.
[17:20.760 --> 17:22.840]  I saw Indy for once.
[17:22.840 --> 17:23.840]  Once.
[17:23.840 --> 17:24.840]  Once.
[17:24.840 --> 17:31.680]  The, um, so you, you and Whiskus were talking about, uh, excitement about the new bond
[17:31.680 --> 17:35.200]  or the, the new Star Wars and hands down, it's got to be the new Star Wars.
[17:35.200 --> 17:39.400]  Yeah, for next year, as much as I'd like bond, but it ain't, come on, like, new Star Wars.
[17:39.400 --> 17:41.320]  Bond has 25 bonds now.
[17:41.320 --> 17:44.720]  Yeah, the bond has the, has the, the out that it's like, all right, there's going to
[17:44.720 --> 17:46.040]  be some bad bond movies.
[17:46.040 --> 17:48.640]  There's going to be some good ones for currently in an upswing because everyone loves
[17:48.640 --> 17:49.640]  Daniel Craig.
[17:49.640 --> 17:53.080]  And like, no matter how big a bond fan you are, you're like, well, this is a bad bond,
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.600]  but I'll wait, like it's, it's, it's, it's evergreen in the same way we're just mentioning
[17:56.600 --> 17:59.640]  Zelda before the same way that the Zelda franchises, you're like, well, I don't like
[17:59.640 --> 18:00.640]  the bond.
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.600]  I like the different that you don't have to worry about continuity.
[18:02.600 --> 18:04.120]  You don't have to worry about actors aging out.
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.480]  They'll just, it's all like Doctor Who, those are rotating in a new guy, they'll be ups
[18:07.480 --> 18:08.480]  and downs and it's fine.
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.440]  So where a Star Wars is a defined continuity in store with specific actors playing specific
[18:12.440 --> 18:14.720]  characters that doesn't have that out.
[18:14.720 --> 18:16.480]  So it's like, it's got to, it's got to count.
[18:16.480 --> 18:17.480]  You don't get a million shot.
[18:17.480 --> 18:18.480]  Right.
[18:18.480 --> 18:23.000]  Well, even if Spector ends up stinking, we would get just as excited next time when, uh,
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  whatever.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  They cast it just.
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  Yeah.
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  Like, it would just be reset.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.400]  And you expectations would be fine.
[18:28.400 --> 18:29.400]  Like, oh, cool.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  Another new bond movie.
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.640]  And I think it's safe to say, I think I forget exactly when GoldenEye came out.
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.160]  But I would say in the last 20 years, we've had four pretty good bond movies.
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.080]  We've had GoldenEye and then the three Daniel Craig ones.
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.080]  So in 20 years, we've already, we've got four good ones under our belt.
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.720]  So a dud, a dud, you know, next year wouldn't weigh us down.
[18:47.720 --> 18:48.720]  Yeah.
[18:48.720 --> 18:49.720]  Like a swing and a miss is not weird football.
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.720]  I don't understand your attraction to GoldenEye, but I will, I will, I will, I will
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.320]  and to concede that we've had a pretty good set of bond movies sprinkled throughout the
[18:58.320 --> 18:59.320]  bad ones.
[18:59.320 --> 19:02.320]  And even the bad ones are like, Mal, whatever, you know, right.
[19:02.320 --> 19:03.320]  Yeah.
[19:03.320 --> 19:04.320]  I don't love GoldenEye.
[19:04.320 --> 19:05.920]  But Star Wars, on the other hand, we're drawn in.
[19:05.920 --> 19:06.920]  Yeah.
[19:06.920 --> 19:07.920]  Yeah.
[19:07.920 --> 19:08.920]  Yeah.
[19:08.920 --> 19:13.480]  Well, but I do think the long term, and this is another reason I thought to convene this
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.720]  and, you know, I've done specials on, you know, bond back in the day with Dan and now we're
[19:17.720 --> 19:18.720]  doing Star Wars.
[19:18.720 --> 19:24.040]  I do think though that ultimately like 20, 25 years from now, we'll look back at Star
[19:24.040 --> 19:29.560]  Wars as a sort of bond like franchise where I think we're going to see an endless series
[19:29.560 --> 19:30.560]  of trilogies.
[19:30.560 --> 19:34.480]  Well, we hope so because when it was tied up in Lucas, like Lucas is the one who waited
[19:34.480 --> 19:37.000]  16 years or whatever to give us episode one.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  And it was all because he controlled everything.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.360]  No, I'm not going to say no corporation would ever have waited that long because it would
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.840]  be like you're sitting on this cash cow.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.880]  What are you doing, right?
[19:46.880 --> 19:51.680]  I'm turning it into a franchise, freeze it from the constraints of, and I suppose by the
[19:51.680 --> 19:55.560]  time this neutrality is over, we'll also freed from the constraints of those characters
[19:55.560 --> 20:00.320]  that we know and love because they'll all be too old or dead, certainly the actors will.
[20:00.320 --> 20:03.120]  And then you're free to do whatever you want within this universe, which you could have
[20:03.120 --> 20:06.680]  done all along, but because Lucas didn't want to do that, that never happened.
[20:06.680 --> 20:07.680]  Right.
[20:07.680 --> 20:15.080]  So I have a weird take on that maybe that I, so I obviously love the universe, I like
[20:15.080 --> 20:19.200]  stories being told at the universe, but I'm kind of of the opinion that the universe
[20:19.200 --> 20:24.480]  exists in order to tell us like the, you know, the, the Vader redemption story and the
[20:24.480 --> 20:27.160]  Luke becomes a heroic story.
[20:27.160 --> 20:35.000]  And while it's fun to go play in that playground, I don't know if, I don't know if the
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.040]  value of the universe is worth it.
[20:39.040 --> 20:43.520]  Like maybe there's maybe you can have another universe to tell other interesting stories.
[20:43.520 --> 20:44.520]  Do you know what I mean?
[20:44.520 --> 20:48.680]  Like, it seems like just because you've got this world to find sort of universe that's
[20:48.680 --> 20:52.600]  been laid out to tell this particular story, the fact that you can shoot on other stories
[20:52.600 --> 20:59.920]  and do it is cool, but maybe not the best use of your storytelling skills.
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.360]  It's not really shoehorning.
[21:01.360 --> 21:05.400]  It's kind of like the Star Trek universe where like the story of Captain Kirk and the
[21:05.400 --> 21:10.160]  Enterprise is one story and, but what you're left with when you're done with that story
[21:10.160 --> 21:15.440]  or you set it aside is essentially a sci-fi, a, a fleshed out sci-fi universe with a built
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.440]  in audience.
[21:16.440 --> 21:20.120]  And it's really just an excuse to make sci-fi movies like I'm looking for anything
[21:20.120 --> 21:25.600]  that will, that will let sci-fi movies be made where they don't have to be constrained
[21:25.600 --> 21:28.000]  by world building because everyone understands the Star Trek universe.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.800]  It's why, I mean, it's hard to use it for TV, you know, deep space nine and all the next
[21:31.800 --> 21:32.800]  generation.
[21:32.800 --> 21:36.560]  It's like next generation is not Captain Kirk again, right, but it is the Enterprise
[21:36.560 --> 21:40.240]  to remember and all the way over to, you know, the, the more, you know, Voyager and stuff
[21:40.240 --> 21:41.240]  like that.
[21:41.240 --> 21:43.800]  I mean, I was saying that those are all great examples of what you can do.
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.280]  But the idea is that once you have an established sci-fi universe, you can do lots of interesting
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.600]  sci-fi things in it.
[21:49.600 --> 21:51.280]  And I want to see more sci-fi.
[21:51.280 --> 21:52.680]  I think there's not enough of it.
[21:52.680 --> 21:57.280]  And every time someone wants to do something sci-fi-ish, they are faced with the problem
[21:57.280 --> 22:01.680]  of I have to describe this sci-fi world before I can even tell my story in an established
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.680]  story.
[22:02.680 --> 22:03.680]  Yeah.
[22:03.680 --> 22:04.680]  It's 30 minutes.
[22:04.680 --> 22:07.440]  If you're lucky, something to spend the whole movie doing that, you know what?
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.240]  I think what you, I think what you need is exactly what you said, Guy, but it, it lets
[22:11.240 --> 22:18.200]  the writer just concentrate on, just give us a handful of really interesting protagonists
[22:18.200 --> 22:23.880]  and antagonists who have an arc, you know, and then you, you have a world to put them
[22:23.880 --> 22:26.960]  in immediately, but give them a different, you know, just give, give us somebody, don't
[22:26.960 --> 22:30.120]  give us a new version of Vader for God's sake, don't just, you know.
[22:30.120 --> 22:34.920]  Yeah, in a way, it's like, like all of these superhero movies sort of faltered because they
[22:34.920 --> 22:37.240]  end up telling the origin story over and over again.
[22:37.240 --> 22:39.960]  Well, that's because they don't have a universe.
[22:39.960 --> 22:42.520]  They have like each, each superhero is a universe in and up to itself.
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.800]  It's not like we've established a universe now, we can just tell stories.
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.880]  It's like, well, I have a new character who the heck is Iron Man, well, I've got to
[22:47.880 --> 22:51.520]  tell you, Iron Man is then you go, Captain America, wait a second, who's Captain America?
[22:51.520 --> 22:53.360]  Each character is a universe.
[22:53.360 --> 22:55.360]  The universe they're in is just normal.
[22:55.360 --> 22:58.160]  There's nothing about like, whereas the Star Wars universe is a Star Trek universe.
[22:58.160 --> 23:01.440]  They have rules about like, how do people get from place to place?
[23:01.440 --> 23:03.680]  How is the system of government organized?
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.480]  How do the alien races get along roughly?
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.480]  And the beauty of Star Wars is that these stories, the original story that's told
[23:10.480 --> 23:14.480]  within the universe, so many things are hinted at and touched on that may be interesting
[23:14.480 --> 23:15.480]  that are already there.
[23:15.480 --> 23:19.840]  Like, you just want to have an entire story about, you know, what kind of others.
[23:19.840 --> 23:20.840]  Yeah.
[23:20.840 --> 23:21.840]  Yeah.
[23:21.840 --> 23:22.840]  Yeah.
[23:22.840 --> 23:23.840]  What happened to an old Mandela?
[23:23.840 --> 23:24.840]  Yeah.
[23:24.840 --> 23:25.840]  Oh, well, I actually really want to find out.
[23:25.840 --> 23:28.480]  I want to go to a bounty hunter story, not both of it, maybe something else.
[23:28.480 --> 23:31.440]  If you're lucky and you give this to the right people, you can end up with a new mini
[23:31.440 --> 23:34.800]  franchise where say this some bounty hunter that uses a very charismatic actor that
[23:34.800 --> 23:41.200]  becomes like a cross between Indiana Jones and Han Solo, but in the Star Wars universe.
[23:41.200 --> 23:43.920]  And they get a series of movies and like, you don't never know which one is going to
[23:43.920 --> 23:46.920]  hit in the same way you never know which one of these, the superhero movies is going to hit.
[23:46.920 --> 23:49.760]  But there's lots of things that have been touched upon.
[23:49.760 --> 23:51.680]  They could say, oh, we could try that as a movie.
[23:51.680 --> 23:55.240]  And the stakes are low, we're like, well, this is mostly going to be, you can make a Star
[23:55.240 --> 24:02.920]  Wars heist movie, or you can make a sort of like the Clone Wars did a lot like rebel
[24:02.920 --> 24:06.680]  academy type movie where it's more like top gun and they're jockeying to be the best
[24:06.680 --> 24:07.680]  ex-wing pilots.
[24:07.680 --> 24:11.080]  So many movies you can make in this universe with things that are already established
[24:11.080 --> 24:13.880]  that can just be plain old science fiction space movies.
[24:13.880 --> 24:14.880]  Right.
[24:14.880 --> 24:15.880]  Okay.
[24:15.880 --> 24:16.880]  Yeah.
[24:16.880 --> 24:17.880]  I feel a bit of a bit of that in now.
[24:17.880 --> 24:18.880]  Yeah, bounty hunter sounds rich.
[24:18.880 --> 24:19.880]  You could do it.
[24:19.880 --> 24:22.560]  You could do like a protagonist bounty hunter is a little bit more like a, uh, like a private
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.920]  tier. Well, like a real bounty hunter though, who's looking to bring people in alive,
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.920]  not really an assassin, you know, which is let's face it with like Boba Fett and some
[24:30.920 --> 24:32.320]  of the other, like those guys.
[24:32.320 --> 24:33.320]  No, no disintegrating.
[24:33.320 --> 24:34.320]  Right.
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.680]  Um, who's maybe like Han, you know, or like indie, the way that indie kept losing out
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.520]  to Belok, everything he went for Belok got first, like a guy who you want to root for
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.160]  because he's, you know, he's not evil.
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.040]  He just, you know, he's just a bit of a rogue, but he keeps losing out to IG 88 or something
[24:49.040 --> 24:51.800]  like that.
[24:51.800 --> 24:53.600]  IG 88 keeps disintegrating.
[24:53.600 --> 24:54.920]  It's his bounty.
[24:54.920 --> 24:55.920]  Yeah.
[24:55.920 --> 24:59.320]  I mean, they aren't doing like so that you have the three that you know, episode
[24:59.320 --> 25:00.920]  789 that they're doing, right?
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.360]  And there's also going to be standalone movies into spurs of them and I understanding
[25:04.360 --> 25:07.400]  and the standalone movies will feature, you know, one of them will feature like Boba
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.840]  Fett and one of them will, you know, with the well known characters, but that's trying
[25:10.840 --> 25:14.480]  starting to establish the cadence of like, all right, there's, there's a trilogy.
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.600]  There's an arc here for these three movies that's going to be a main story.
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.360]  But then we're going to start having to stand alone to get people used to the idea.
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.200]  And I bet you if anyone of those standalones like really catches, they're like, Oh, that
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.320]  standalone, you know, those characters that set, or that conflict or whatever now spins
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.720]  off into its own little mini arc, like it's giving you the freedom to try a bunch of things,
[25:32.720 --> 25:37.240]  see which one sticks without people being upset of, you know, that like, oh, there's the
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.480]  only three chances we get episode one, two and three and one episode one, stinks will
[25:40.480 --> 25:42.320]  maybe episode two will be good episode two sucks.
[25:42.320 --> 25:43.320]  I'll forget it now.
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.800]  There's no hope for episode three and that's it.
[25:44.800 --> 25:45.800]  Yeah.
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.520]  I'm actually really excited about eight and nine, because it's, it's, it's,
[25:49.520 --> 25:51.840]  uh, fender the show, uh, Rhian Johnson, right?
[25:51.840 --> 25:53.240]  Well, at least writing.
[25:53.240 --> 25:54.240]  We don't know.
[25:54.240 --> 25:55.240]  Right.
[25:55.240 --> 25:56.240]  Yeah.
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.280]  I don't think he's directing eight and then he's doing the, the sort of the, the treatment
[26:01.280 --> 26:04.000]  for nine, I thought, but maybe I'm confused.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.840]  I, I'm not quite sure what's official on that, but either way, it's pretty cool.
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.840]  Yeah.
[26:09.840 --> 26:10.840]  Yeah.
[26:10.840 --> 26:11.840]  Yeah.
[26:11.840 --> 26:12.840]  That's awesome.
[26:12.840 --> 26:15.520]  Because episode seven is going to set up the conflict that I assume will play out over
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.520]  the course.
[26:16.520 --> 26:17.520]  Yeah.
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.520]  Yeah.
[26:19.520 --> 26:20.520]  Yeah.
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.520]  Yeah.
[26:21.520 --> 26:26.520]  I just hope it's a strong arc because that like in, you know, so the original
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.520]  trilogy had such a strong thing with like an iconic villain and a, and an iconic
[26:32.520 --> 26:36.520]  hero, a, a young hero, the hero gets to evolve over the course of the thing, but
[26:36.520 --> 26:37.520]  it's such a clear conflict.
[26:37.520 --> 26:42.520]  Rebel Empire, Luke Vader, a little bit of twisting some Yoda, you know, Yoda
[26:42.520 --> 26:43.520]  stuff in there.
[26:43.520 --> 26:44.520]  And I'm your father and all this stuff.
[26:44.520 --> 26:48.520]  Like that is such a good, satisfying, sturdy, simple arc.
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.520]  Uh, and modern movies I find tend to over complicate things with like too
[26:53.520 --> 26:56.520]  much, I don't know.
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.720]  Not to say too much nuance, but like it's that the bones are not as sturdy.
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.120]  Like there always has to be a lot of, a lot of things in the mix.
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.120]  And it's just Star Wars for me seems to be more about clarity, simplicity, and
[27:10.120 --> 27:15.120]  sturdiness of, you know, archetypes, and you have to do it well.
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.120]  And that's, that's what you can hang your three movies on.
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.120]  The, the, the talk show research department is just beat me.
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.120]  According to IMDB at least Ryan Johnson has been named as the director for
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.120]  both episodes, uh, eight and nine.
[27:29.120 --> 27:30.120]  So that is good.
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.120]  That's good.
[27:31.120 --> 27:32.120]  Cause I'd like to look for a lot.
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.120]  No, I do agree with that.
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.120]  And I think what John just said is, is in a nutshell.
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.120]  And I feel like we can continue on for most of the rest of the show and sort of
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.120]  compare the first trilogy versus the prequel trilogy in detail and in broad strokes.
[27:44.120 --> 27:47.120]  But in broad strokes, the single biggest problem between the two.
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.120]  Well, that's hard to say is a single biggest cause there's maybe three or four
[27:51.120 --> 27:52.120]  enormous problems.
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.120]  But one, one of them is the simple lack of clarity over who's the good guys and
[27:56.120 --> 28:01.120]  who's the bad guys in the first one right before you ever see anything.
[28:01.120 --> 28:03.120]  You see the logo, you hear the fanfare.
[28:03.120 --> 28:06.120]  And it's already very exciting because it's a cool logo.
[28:06.120 --> 28:10.120]  And it's really cool fanfare to start the theme song.
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.120]  And then boom, you get the scroll.
[28:12.120 --> 28:16.120]  And the scroll says right at the beginning of the scroll, there's these good
[28:16.120 --> 28:22.120]  guy rebels who've just won their first victory against the evil galactic empire.
[28:22.120 --> 28:24.120]  And there you've already got the basic gist of it.
[28:24.120 --> 28:27.120]  You could if you're a little kid and you can't even read that fast.
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.120]  If you could at least get that first paragraph.
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.120]  Rebels win first victory against evil galactic empire.
[28:34.120 --> 28:36.120]  Just right there, evil.
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.120]  And then all of a sudden you miss the rest of the words.
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.120]  And then you see a little tiny spaceship being chased by an enormous badass
[28:42.120 --> 28:43.120]  looking spaceship.
[28:43.120 --> 28:45.120]  You know exactly what's going on.
[28:45.120 --> 28:46.120]  You've already got it.
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.120]  Good guys, outgunned, bad guys, enormous resources.
[28:51.120 --> 28:54.120]  And there's that's the whole three movies right there.
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.120]  And it's very clear.
[28:55.120 --> 29:00.120]  Yeah, the prequel set up like the type of movie it would have to be to use that
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.120]  type of set up is like it would have to be kind of like,
[29:04.120 --> 29:06.120]  I'm not even as even this is simpler.
[29:06.120 --> 29:09.120]  Like like Rome on HBO or like, you know,
[29:09.120 --> 29:12.120]  it's all about political intrigue and the fall of a decadent empire.
[29:12.120 --> 29:15.120]  And that is a much more complicated story than, you know,
[29:15.120 --> 29:19.120]  underdog rebels versus oppressive empire.
[29:19.120 --> 29:22.120]  You know, like it's a different story.
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.120]  It's like turning it into a political thriller.
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.120]  It's like, well, that's not really what Star Wars is.
[29:27.120 --> 29:33.120]  And then you failed to confidently execute a sort of geopolitical thriller.
[29:33.120 --> 29:37.120]  Because geopolitical thrillers don't have a lot of spaceship chases and gunfights.
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.120]  Like they're all about backroom dealings.
[29:40.120 --> 29:42.120]  And, you know, it's like, what is it?
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.120]  House of Cards in space.
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.120]  Like it's not, no one involves in that movie was equipped to do that.
[29:47.120 --> 29:48.120]  The script didn't support it.
[29:48.120 --> 29:49.120]  The characters didn't support it.
[29:49.120 --> 29:50.120]  And that's not the story we wanted to hear.
[29:50.120 --> 29:53.120]  We wanted to hear, hey, at the Darth Vader guys,
[29:53.120 --> 29:55.120]  who supposedly was nice turning to Darth Vader.
[29:55.120 --> 29:56.120]  That's what we wanted to hear.
[29:56.120 --> 29:57.120]  We got three movies to tell me that.
[29:57.120 --> 29:58.120]  And you're just like, actually,
[29:58.120 --> 30:01.120]  I want to tell you about the fall of the decadent Jedi.
[30:01.120 --> 30:03.120]  And I'll do a really crappy job of it.
[30:03.120 --> 30:05.120]  Not not interested and you did a bad job.
[30:05.120 --> 30:07.120]  Yeah, I think it's two levels deep.
[30:07.120 --> 30:10.120]  Or one, you didn't want a political thriller anyway.
[30:10.120 --> 30:13.120]  And two, the political thriller that George Lucas wrote,
[30:13.120 --> 30:15.120]  made zero sense whatsoever.
[30:15.120 --> 30:19.120]  And I don't mean that in a small sense to exaggerate
[30:19.120 --> 30:20.120]  that little sense it makes.
[30:20.120 --> 30:22.120]  It just doesn't hold any water at all.
[30:22.120 --> 30:25.120]  I can see the story he was going for.
[30:25.120 --> 30:28.120]  Because it's sort of like this,
[30:28.120 --> 30:30.120]  he tells you flat out like this is,
[30:30.120 --> 30:32.120]  he has characters say things
[30:32.120 --> 30:34.120]  that are basically like the text of the movie.
[30:34.120 --> 30:36.120]  And it went with the Emperor saying stuff.
[30:36.120 --> 30:39.120]  But it's like that,
[30:39.120 --> 30:43.120]  I can imagine a story like that as like a side story.
[30:43.120 --> 30:45.120]  Or as like maybe one of the expanded universe novels
[30:45.120 --> 30:47.120]  describing the fall of the Republic
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.120]  and why the Republic fell.
[30:49.120 --> 30:51.120]  But it would have to involve entirely different characters.
[30:51.120 --> 30:54.120]  And it would have nothing to do with Darth Vader
[30:54.120 --> 30:57.120]  or anything we cared about knowing in these prequels.
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.120]  I always think it's a mistake to tell the backstory
[30:59.120 --> 31:03.120]  of your most intriguing villain or anti-hero.
[31:03.120 --> 31:06.120]  Because all you can do is lessen them.
[31:06.120 --> 31:08.120]  Like a lot of the power comes in there.
[31:08.120 --> 31:10.120]  No, no, no, you can think of things.
[31:10.120 --> 31:11.120]  Here's the thing with Vader.
[31:11.120 --> 31:13.120]  Vader is a cartoon villain in the first movie
[31:13.120 --> 31:15.120]  and by the final movie you sympathize with him.
[31:15.120 --> 31:17.120]  So that's the arc of his character.
[31:17.120 --> 31:18.120]  Yeah, so that's it.
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.120]  You're done.
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.120]  That's right.
[31:20.120 --> 31:21.120]  But would you want to know,
[31:21.120 --> 31:23.120]  you still want to know how did Vader get to the place
[31:23.120 --> 31:24.120]  in a new hope?
[31:24.120 --> 31:27.120]  How did the supposedly sympathetic person come?
[31:27.120 --> 31:30.120]  And I always compare it to the best case scenario of this
[31:30.120 --> 31:32.120]  is the Godfather series, not counting movie three,
[31:32.120 --> 31:34.120]  where you take Michael Corollion,
[31:34.120 --> 31:37.120]  who is a good person, smart.
[31:37.120 --> 31:39.120]  He means well.
[31:39.120 --> 31:41.120]  He's thrust into a difficult situation.
[31:41.120 --> 31:43.120]  And he tries to do the right thing.
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.120]  Every time he's presented with the decision,
[31:46.120 --> 31:47.120]  he tries to do what he thinks is the right thing
[31:47.120 --> 31:49.120]  for himself and his family.
[31:49.120 --> 31:51.120]  And a series of what he thinks are good decisions
[31:51.120 --> 31:54.120]  lead him to the place where he is at the end of Godfather, too.
[31:54.120 --> 31:57.120]  It's how can a good person make a series of moves
[31:57.120 --> 32:00.120]  they think are right end up in a super dark place?
[32:00.120 --> 32:03.120]  And the Godfather is obviously this is a high bar, right?
[32:03.120 --> 32:04.120]  But if you want to say,
[32:04.120 --> 32:07.120]  well, good feelings is the same thing in a way, right?
[32:07.120 --> 32:10.120]  It's a kind of bad place is being witness protection.
[32:10.120 --> 32:12.120]  That's more like how do things fall apart,
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.120]  whereas what you want to know in Vader
[32:14.120 --> 32:16.120]  is how do things come together?
[32:16.120 --> 32:18.120]  How do they come to an head where you are just this,
[32:18.120 --> 32:22.120]  you know, where you are, one of the top people
[32:22.120 --> 32:24.120]  in the Empire, and eventually at the end of the desktop
[32:24.120 --> 32:26.120]  by the time Empire Strikes Back,
[32:26.120 --> 32:29.120]  you are the fist of the Empire crushing everybody else.
[32:29.120 --> 32:31.120]  You're like, this was a good person to have that happen.
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.120]  And so we catch it at the end, right?
[32:34.120 --> 32:38.120]  I would like to see the story of how does this good person fall
[32:38.120 --> 32:39.120]  into that, because that can be a variant.
[32:39.120 --> 32:40.120]  I like that story.
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.120]  It's kind of like, I don't know what you would call it.
[32:42.120 --> 32:43.120]  It's a tragedy.
[32:43.120 --> 32:45.120]  It's the downfall of a great person.
[32:45.120 --> 32:48.120]  It's a person I care about who you identify with.
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.120]  Through all three of the Godfather moves,
[32:49.120 --> 32:50.120]  you feel for my who called your own.
[32:50.120 --> 32:52.120]  You identify with him.
[32:52.120 --> 32:55.120]  You feel like he is the protagonist that he is the good of,
[32:55.120 --> 32:57.120]  which is why Godfather 2 is still brilliant.
[32:57.120 --> 32:58.120]  This is the good guy.
[32:58.120 --> 33:00.120]  It takes you through that journey and realizes
[33:00.120 --> 33:02.120]  it makes you realize along with everything else
[33:02.120 --> 33:06.120]  in the movie that this arc has bent in a particular direction.
[33:06.120 --> 33:08.120]  I would like to see that movie about Anakin.
[33:08.120 --> 33:09.120]  So I agree with you.
[33:09.120 --> 33:12.120]  I would like, since I was a kid,
[33:12.120 --> 33:17.120]  I've always been curious about how Anakin looks farther
[33:17.120 --> 33:18.120]  to turn to the dark side.
[33:18.120 --> 33:19.120]  That's fascinating.
[33:19.120 --> 33:22.120]  But I think the degree of difficulty of telling that story
[33:22.120 --> 33:25.120]  in a satisfactory manner is so high
[33:25.120 --> 33:29.120]  that you basically just run the risk of ruining the character.
[33:29.120 --> 33:33.120]  Well, you've been paid attention to the prequels.
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.120]  Vader sucks, basically.
[33:35.120 --> 33:36.120]  I disagree.
[33:36.120 --> 33:38.120]  You have to.
[33:38.120 --> 33:39.120]  You have to, right?
[33:39.120 --> 33:41.120]  Because you can't believe that that's the same guy.
[33:41.120 --> 33:43.120]  And you don't, it just makes sense.
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.120]  You don't root for him.
[33:44.120 --> 33:45.120]  Really.
[33:45.120 --> 33:46.120]  I mean, it has to be.
[33:46.120 --> 33:49.120]  Michael Corleone is a good example because you do root for Michael
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.120]  and you sympathize with his decisions.
[33:51.120 --> 33:54.120]  Like, I mean, I think clearly probably the biggest decision
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.120]  that starts him on a path he's never going to get out of
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.120]  is when he volunteers to, I don't remember his name,
[34:01.120 --> 34:02.120]  but he volunteers to.
[34:02.120 --> 34:03.120]  Yeah, kills a lot.
[34:03.120 --> 34:07.120]  So is, you know, all of a sudden he's not up until then
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.120]  on paper he is clean.
[34:10.120 --> 34:12.120]  He's a war hero.
[34:12.120 --> 34:14.120]  He's, you know, I think he's college educated.
[34:14.120 --> 34:15.120]  You know, his father said,
[34:15.120 --> 34:16.120]  You're getting a blood all over your Ivy League shirt,
[34:16.120 --> 34:17.120]  something like that as well?
[34:17.120 --> 34:20.120]  Yeah, he's, you know, he's set up for a career in politics
[34:20.120 --> 34:22.120]  and where maybe his family is in clean.
[34:22.120 --> 34:25.120]  He is like somebody could look at whatever he's done
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.120]  and if they knew the truth, they'd find out that he's a good kid
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.120]  from a gangster family.
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.120]  Whereas once he pulls the hit on Salatso,
[34:33.120 --> 34:35.120]  that's, you know, he's got to keep that secret.
[34:35.120 --> 34:37.120]  And it's motivated by love of family, love of father.
[34:37.120 --> 34:38.120]  Right.
[34:38.120 --> 34:40.120]  Here's the thing that could, you know, he said, like,
[34:40.120 --> 34:41.120]  it's very difficult to tell that story.
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.120]  One of the videos that John sat around,
[34:43.120 --> 34:47.120]  he wanted us to watch before this was the kid bash thing
[34:47.120 --> 34:49.120]  where they were trying to show some of the influences
[34:49.120 --> 34:52.120]  that George Lucas had to be intercutting those influences
[34:52.120 --> 34:55.120]  into the video of a new hope.
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.120]  Like, like George Lucas was inspired by, you know,
[34:58.120 --> 35:01.120]  these Kurosawa movies and Westerns and Flash Gordon
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.120]  and he just pulls from those and puts them in the movie
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.120]  and the modern example that I love the best is
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.120]  like a Quentin Tarantino, all the movies, all the genres of movies
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.120]  that he loved, particular movies, particular scenes,
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.120]  particular images that he grew up with.
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.120]  He repurposes and remixes and filters through his own mind
[35:17.120 --> 35:20.120]  and imagination and makes something greater than the whole.
[35:20.120 --> 35:23.120]  If you wanted to tell the downfall of Darth Vader story
[35:23.120 --> 35:25.120]  and you didn't have any better ideas,
[35:25.120 --> 35:27.120]  you could do that same appropriation and remixing directly
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.120]  from gangster movies.
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.120]  The godfather, like you said, good fellas,
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.120]  there are so many sources for you to perform the same creative
[35:34.120 --> 35:37.120]  function of saying, I mean, you could just pull that story
[35:37.120 --> 35:40.120]  straight out and use that as the bones to hair within
[35:40.120 --> 35:43.120]  and use particular scenes and like, you know,
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.120]  just there are other examples of this type of story
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.120]  from cinema and it is essentially a tragedy
[35:47.120 --> 35:50.120]  and even when we know the ending that makes it all
[35:50.120 --> 35:52.120]  the more poignant because the first few movies you'd really
[35:52.120 --> 35:55.120]  wanted to have us identifying with and rooting for
[35:55.120 --> 35:58.120]  Anakin and then at the end it would be all the worst
[35:58.120 --> 36:00.120]  for the audience that they would feel terrible
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.120]  that they know what's coming, kind of like Titanic me
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.120]  and you know the boat's going to sink, right?
[36:04.120 --> 36:06.120]  But you just got, you got to build up to me
[36:06.120 --> 36:07.120]  and then have the sinking be meaningful
[36:07.120 --> 36:09.120]  because now you become attached to these characters.
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.120]  Well, you know, it's even like historical precedent,
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.120]  like, I don't know, Caesar and Rome,
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.120]  like where he goes and basically becomes the emperor.
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.120]  That seems like a decent model for the takeover
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.120]  of the Republic, right?
[36:22.120 --> 36:23.120]  And you know it's going to happen here too,
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.120]  they've told that story many times.
[36:25.120 --> 36:26.120]  You know what's happening?
[36:26.120 --> 36:27.120]  It's going to happen to Caesar.
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.120]  You just got to, how can I tell that story
[36:28.120 --> 36:30.120]  so that I care when it happens?
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.120]  Knowing knowing the ending is actually a very well,
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.120]  it's a well-trotting path for,
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.120]  especially I think tragic fiction.
[36:40.120 --> 36:42.120]  I mean Shakespeare,
[36:42.120 --> 36:44.120]  most of so many of Shakespeare's plays
[36:44.120 --> 36:46.120]  were not original stories.
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.120]  They were either historical or they were these,
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.120]  you know, parables that had been passed down by spoken word
[36:53.120 --> 36:54.120]  for a hundred years.
[36:54.120 --> 36:56.120]  People knew that just of them,
[36:56.120 --> 36:58.120]  all he did was do them really, really well
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.120]  with really clever dialogue
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.120]  and really crisply define characters.
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.120]  But the fact that people knew where they were going
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.120]  emphasizes the tragedy of it.
[37:07.120 --> 37:10.120]  It's like the Hitchcock thing where the Hitchcock thing was
[37:10.120 --> 37:12.120]  have the bomb under the guy's chair.
[37:12.120 --> 37:13.120]  The character doesn't know the bomb there,
[37:13.120 --> 37:15.120]  but show the audience the bomb under the chair.
[37:15.120 --> 37:17.120]  So the audience knows ahead of time
[37:17.120 --> 37:18.120]  that there's a bomb under the chair
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.120]  where the characters don't know.
[37:19.120 --> 37:20.120]  So when you know Anakin's going to turn
[37:20.120 --> 37:21.120]  and if you're rooting for Anakin,
[37:21.120 --> 37:24.120]  everything Anakin does that bring some closer to the dark side.
[37:24.120 --> 37:25.120]  Like the audience knows like,
[37:25.120 --> 37:27.120]  no Anakin, there's a bomb under your seat.
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.120]  Don't you see that, you know what I mean?
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  Like this ample precedent for how to do this well.
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.120]  Just because it wasn't done well doesn't mean it couldn't be.
[37:34.120 --> 37:35.120]  Right.
[37:35.120 --> 37:39.120]  You lose the surprise and you gain tremendous tension,
[37:39.120 --> 37:40.120]  tension at last.
[37:40.120 --> 37:43.120]  Whereas like, and I think in the other side of that Hitchcock
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.120]  parable, you know, his advice on show the audience the bomb
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.120]  under and put it under a little girl's seat.
[37:48.120 --> 37:50.120]  I have it a little girl in a piece of popcorn
[37:50.120 --> 37:53.120]  and you show the bomb that's under her seat.
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.120]  He said, you know, everybody's first instinct though
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.120]  if they're making a thriller is to make the bomb a secret.
[37:59.120 --> 38:02.120]  And we don't find it goes off until it goes off.
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.120]  And that makes us the real audience no different
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.120]  than the audience in the theater where the bomb is.
[38:06.120 --> 38:08.120]  And he says, you know, you surprise,
[38:08.120 --> 38:10.120]  you can surprise the hell out of the audience that way,
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.120]  but there's no tension.
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  You know, the tension is what makes cinema interesting.
[38:17.120 --> 38:22.120]  I think that there's just no arc with Anakin
[38:30.120 --> 38:33.120]  in the prequel trilogy.
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.120]  It's all just annoying annoying annoying annoying annoying annoying annoying
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.120]  annoying and then all of a sudden with 45 minutes to go flip
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.120]  to the dark side.
[38:41.120 --> 38:42.120]  So I don't for no good reason.
[38:42.120 --> 38:44.120]  I mean, we'll talk about this when we do the episode three
[38:44.120 --> 38:47.120]  and then comparable, I'm sure, but it's like, you've got three
[38:47.120 --> 38:49.120]  movies to explain why this guy's going to turn
[38:49.120 --> 38:52.120]  and just the movie hours are ticking by and you're talking
[38:52.120 --> 38:55.120]  about the Emperor and you're talking about people running around
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.120]  shooting each other and very other consequence of kinds of things.
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.120]  And at no point you're like, so why is he going to suddenly turn
[39:02.120 --> 39:04.120]  evil? Oh, because the script tells him to like,
[39:04.120 --> 39:06.120]  God, I guess. And now I kill children. Sure.
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  That comes. Yeah. Right. That fits perfect.
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.120]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  Yeah. I was so shattered after the, like,
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.120]  the original teaser trailer for Phantom Menace.
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.120]  There's one shot of Anakin standing in everybody's
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.120]  cheering him. Anakin, the little boy.
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.120]  And I totally had this weird, like my interpretation
[39:27.120 --> 39:30.120]  was that he's just so forceful that everybody thinks he's awesome
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.120]  and it basically is, his ego is going to end up eating him
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.120]  and turning him to invader. And then it turned out it was
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.120]  whatever, because he ran a goofy pod race, which
[39:40.120 --> 39:43.120]  is like, what a letdown. Like just so many big things that they
[39:43.120 --> 39:45.120]  could have done with that character. And that is a simplified
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.120]  way to go. Like, oh, he's super powerful. It goes to his head.
[39:48.120 --> 39:51.120]  Like that's more of the Marvel villain type of thing where you
[39:51.120 --> 39:53.120]  if you're super famous and you're just like, you know what,
[39:53.120 --> 39:56.120]  I'm such a super genius. Everyone else on earth, they're just like
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.120]  ants to me. I should rule over them. And they're, you know,
[39:59.120 --> 40:02.120]  that's one way to go. It's a little bit more cartoonish villain.
[40:02.120 --> 40:04.120]  It is definitely not as sophisticated as a Michael Corleone thing
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.120]  because that's what you want to happen because the arc
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.120]  on trilogy is that Vader is actually a thinking feeling sympathetic
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.120]  person who finally connects with Luke and has a, you know,
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.120]  cares for his son, repents for his son, dies for them.
[40:19.120 --> 40:23.120]  And, you know, has like, that's the person that you're
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.120]  promised. And the crazy ego maniac, it's difficult to reconcile
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.120]  that was like, I think you have to go kind of a Michael
[40:30.120 --> 40:32.120]  Corleone where it's like, he did want to do the right thing.
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.120]  And they tried to do that. It's like, and again,
[40:34.120 --> 40:37.120]  and it goes whiny and annoying. And the romance angle
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.120]  there's no chemistry there. There's, romance is a way you can kind
[40:41.120 --> 40:44.120]  of go bad, but that's more like leads you into a crime of passion.
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.120]  It doesn't lead you to, you know, rule over a giant empire
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.120]  and kill the Jedi and start by slaughtering children.
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.120]  And it's like, well, I really didn't want my mom to die.
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.120]  So I guess now I should kill these children because some guy
[40:55.120 --> 40:57.120]  promised me I'll be able to help people stay alive.
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.120]  Like if you want people to stay alive, you're not going to be killing
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.120]  children. I don't know.
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.120]  Yeah. I did do some other just sorry.
[41:04.120 --> 41:05.120]  Go ahead.
[41:05.120 --> 41:05.120]  Go ahead.
[41:05.120 --> 41:08.120]  Just a pointing stuff there where, I mean, they advertise him
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.120]  as being incredibly powerful, more powerful in the new order.
[41:12.120 --> 41:15.120]  That, and he doesn't do anything powerful.
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.120]  I felt that when, I felt that they sort of lost an opportunity
[41:19.120 --> 41:22.120]  in the second movie when, first of all, I don't like any of this,
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.120]  but when the sad people of captures his mother, and he loses it,
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.120]  I kind of just wanted them to just force destroy this city.
[41:30.120 --> 41:31.120]  You know what?
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.120]  The encampment.
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.120]  Like just tear it apart with his mother.
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.120]  If you want to go to that angle, like the heat that he's super powerful,
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.120]  then you could start pulling from child prodigy movies.
[41:41.120 --> 41:42.120]  Yes, exactly.
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.120]  That's how prodigies who are very good,
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.120]  or you can do like a Bobby Fisher type thing,
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.120]  like they're a chess genius, or like, you know,
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.120]  an Ender's game type thing where they're a child and they have amazing
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.120]  powers, but they're not emotionally ready to deal with them.
[41:55.120 --> 41:58.120]  But that wasn't played up.
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.120]  He wasn't played up.
[42:00.120 --> 42:02.120]  But it wasn't about his strength.
[42:02.120 --> 42:03.120]  Otherwise, he was just like,
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.120]  he's pretty good Jedi, seems fine.
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.120]  Yeah, he seems, I mean, he seems equivalent power to Obi-Wan.
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.120]  Yeah, he's not as wise.
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.120]  He's stupid.
[42:11.120 --> 42:12.120]  He doesn't listen to instructions,
[42:12.120 --> 42:15.120]  but he's not super, like the Jedi powers are kind of like the marble powers,
[42:15.120 --> 42:19.120]  and depending on the scene, especially in the preples,
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.120]  there's no real arc to the Jedi powers,
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.120]  and it's not clear what they're able to do or not able to do.
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.120]  Yeah, it's what everybody needs at the time.
[42:28.120 --> 42:29.120]  Yeah, and the original trilogy,
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.120]  it's like the force is mysterious and weird and pretty weak,
[42:32.120 --> 42:35.120]  and by the time Yoda is pulling next to me at a swamp,
[42:35.120 --> 42:36.120]  it's genuinely impressive.
[42:36.120 --> 42:37.120]  Whereas in the prequel,
[42:37.120 --> 42:39.120]  it's like sometimes we're moving to giant rocks,
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.120]  sometimes we're pushing one dude away,
[42:42.120 --> 42:44.120]  sometimes we're moving to salt shaker and apple.
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.120]  It's just like, it's sometimes we've got lightning,
[42:46.120 --> 42:48.120]  but you can block the lightning,
[42:48.120 --> 42:50.120]  but it's like that the rules aren't all worked out.
[42:50.120 --> 42:51.120]  Whereas in the original trilogy,
[42:51.120 --> 42:52.120]  there was a clear arc,
[42:52.120 --> 42:55.120]  there were three whole movies they made in arc of force power.
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.120]  The lightning doesn't appear into the third movie,
[42:57.120 --> 42:58.120]  and when it does you're surprised
[42:58.120 --> 43:00.120]  and it's clearly a higher echelon of power
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.120]  and the prequel sits all over the map.
[43:02.120 --> 43:04.120]  Yeah, I thought that the other lesson
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.120]  that was very, very clear in the original trilogy,
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.120]  from all three movies,
[43:10.120 --> 43:11.120]  but in a growing,
[43:11.120 --> 43:13.120]  especially in the second two,
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.120]  where Luke is more in training to be a Jedi,
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.120]  and the third one be growing as a young Jedi.
[43:22.120 --> 43:25.120]  Because this point of,
[43:25.120 --> 43:27.120]  if you're going to be a Jedi,
[43:27.120 --> 43:30.120]  you can't touch the dark side.
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.120]  Once you go, it's all corrupt.
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.120]  You can't just dip your toes in the dark side.
[43:35.120 --> 43:38.120]  Once you touch it, it's going to corrupt you.
[43:38.120 --> 43:40.120]  So I have a theory on that.
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.120]  I think I might have told Jon offline some of the time.
[43:44.120 --> 43:46.120]  I think, so I mean,
[43:46.120 --> 43:48.120]  Vader's supposed to bring balance to the force,
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.120]  and effectively he does that by murdering everybody
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.120]  to cut a force power, except for Luke.
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.120]  And I think the thing with Luke
[43:55.120 --> 43:58.120]  is that he does touch the dark side.
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.120]  He uses a force choke on a guard.
[44:01.120 --> 44:03.120]  That's not cool.
[44:03.120 --> 44:04.120]  No other Jedi has done that,
[44:04.120 --> 44:05.120]  but he just walks into Jabba's Palace
[44:05.120 --> 44:07.120]  and strangles a guy.
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.120]  He's dressed on a black, didn't Jedi.
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.120]  And he defeats Vader
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.120]  by just getting really, really angry
[44:16.120 --> 44:18.120]  and being the crap out of him.
[44:18.120 --> 44:20.120]  But that's what I think.
[44:20.120 --> 44:23.120]  I think the balance is where when he tosses his legs
[44:23.120 --> 44:26.120]  and decides that like,
[44:26.120 --> 44:30.120]  no, I can, Luke uniquely can pull back from the dark side.
[44:30.120 --> 44:32.120]  I'm so willing to reject the dark side
[44:32.120 --> 44:34.120]  that I'll leave myself defenceless.
[44:34.120 --> 44:37.120]  But he didn't really accept it.
[44:37.120 --> 44:39.120]  Isn't that entirely a creation of the prequels?
[44:39.120 --> 44:40.120]  The entire...
[44:40.120 --> 44:41.120]  Yeah, entirely.
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.120]  That's why I think it's BS
[44:43.120 --> 44:45.120]  because it's like saying,
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.120]  well, we need to have a balance machine,
[44:47.120 --> 44:49.120]  murder, and safety.
[44:49.120 --> 44:50.120]  We need to have a balance between robbery
[44:50.120 --> 44:52.120]  and having your goods be secure.
[44:52.120 --> 44:53.120]  We need to have some robberies,
[44:53.120 --> 44:55.120]  but then sometimes things are stolen.
[44:55.120 --> 44:56.120]  And we need to have some murder,
[44:56.120 --> 44:57.120]  mostly not murders.
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.120]  We need to have some anger and hatred,
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.120]  but not some...
[45:02.120 --> 45:03.120]  No, I disagree.
[45:03.120 --> 45:04.120]  I think...
[45:04.120 --> 45:06.120]  So I think if anything,
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.120]  I am fistedly,
[45:08.120 --> 45:13.120]  the Jedi Order is depicted as being emotionless and detached.
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.120]  And ultimately, that kind of leads to their downfall.
[45:16.120 --> 45:19.120]  But that's not the type of balance you're talking about.
[45:19.120 --> 45:21.120]  You're talking about dark side balance.
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.120]  You're not talking about emotional detached.
[45:23.120 --> 45:24.120]  Dark side versus...
[45:24.120 --> 45:28.120]  But I think dark side is facing the passion angle of it.
[45:28.120 --> 45:29.120]  Well, we only get it,
[45:29.120 --> 45:30.120]  Jedi.
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.120]  They're not passionately loving anybody.
[45:33.120 --> 45:35.120]  You know what I mean?
[45:35.120 --> 45:36.120]  I mean, like I know what you're saying.
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.120]  I mean, like this is the emotional detachment depicted again.
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.120]  This is all dependent on the prequels.
[45:40.120 --> 45:41.120]  If you pretend the prequels don't exist,
[45:41.120 --> 45:42.120]  the arc is clear.
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.120]  The dark side is using your powers for evil.
[45:44.120 --> 45:46.120]  And Jedi have tremendous powers,
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[45:48.120 --> 45:49.120]  That's the dark side.
[45:49.120 --> 45:50.120]  And the whole idea is look,
[45:50.120 --> 45:51.120]  we're going to give you these powers.
[45:51.120 --> 45:53.120]  And it's going to be really tempting to use these powers
[45:53.120 --> 45:54.120]  to essentially get your way.
[45:54.120 --> 45:57.120]  And even if the way your way is the good.
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  Like, well, I really wanted to defeat the Empire.
[45:59.120 --> 46:00.120]  You still should be careful,
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.120]  because it's really easy to slip into, like, you know,
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.120]  using your emotions to tell you what you should do with these powers.
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.120]  And his whole arc is like,
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.120]  I'm going to try...
[46:10.120 --> 46:11.120]  He's hothead,
[46:11.120 --> 46:12.120]  and we're going to try to stay away from the dark side.
[46:12.120 --> 46:14.120]  But you know, by the second movie that, you know,
[46:14.120 --> 46:16.120]  his father had problem dealing with this.
[46:16.120 --> 46:17.120]  And he's a hothead, too.
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.120]  And he really wants to defeat Vader.
[46:18.120 --> 46:19.120]  And Vader just terrible things.
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.120]  And he was the audience,
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.120]  you're like, pound him, kill him,
[46:21.120 --> 46:22.120]  or whatever.
[46:22.120 --> 46:23.120]  But in the end, as I've talked about in the episode,
[46:23.120 --> 46:24.120]  we did about trying to do that.
[46:24.120 --> 46:26.120]  In the end, his story of pacifism,
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.120]  where he's the only movie hero ever
[46:28.120 --> 46:31.120]  to embrace pacifism in the climactic scene.
[46:31.120 --> 46:33.120]  He gets away with it because Vader,
[46:33.120 --> 46:35.120]  who's already completely, you know, corrupted.
[46:35.120 --> 46:36.120]  That's no problem killing the Emperor.
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  But he's like, I would rather die
[46:38.120 --> 46:40.120]  than fall to the dark side.
[46:40.120 --> 46:41.120]  Because it's a personal victory for him.
[46:41.120 --> 46:43.120]  He essentially says, he's had his victory.
[46:43.120 --> 46:46.120]  His whole victory was like, can I master the force?
[46:46.120 --> 46:47.120]  Can I master myself?
[46:47.120 --> 46:49.120]  Can I not give in to my hatred and everything?
[46:49.120 --> 46:50.120]  And in the end, he does.
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.120]  And that is his victory.
[46:51.120 --> 46:54.120]  And even if he had been killed by the Emperor and by Vader,
[46:54.120 --> 46:55.120]  he still would have won.
[46:55.120 --> 46:57.120]  And Yoda would have been proud of him,
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.120]  but we still get the happy ending because Vader doesn't.
[46:59.120 --> 47:00.120]  That's his arc.
[47:00.120 --> 47:03.120]  It's not like, well, I had to choke the remarrying guard.
[47:03.120 --> 47:06.120]  I had to get angry to defeat Vader.
[47:06.120 --> 47:07.120]  You didn't have to do all that stuff.
[47:07.120 --> 47:09.120]  That was his battle against himself.
[47:09.120 --> 47:10.120]  And when he's doing that,
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.120]  when he's wailing and Vader, the sad music is playing.
[47:12.120 --> 47:13.120]  Not the happy music.
[47:13.120 --> 47:14.120]  There was no balance in him.
[47:14.120 --> 47:17.120]  There's no balance in him using his anger to beat up on Vader.
[47:17.120 --> 47:19.120]  That is his slow defeat.
[47:19.120 --> 47:21.120]  The balance angle coming from the free-pull,
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.120]  I think you'd have a better argument for the balance being
[47:25.120 --> 47:28.120]  that the Jedi have to sort of be more in touch
[47:28.120 --> 47:31.120]  with their emotions and not be...
[47:31.120 --> 47:33.120]  It's kind of more like arguing for that priest
[47:33.120 --> 47:35.120]  shouldn't be seldom in the church.
[47:35.120 --> 47:37.120]  Because I don't think that's coming out of him.
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.120]  But I don't think Luke walks away from Jedi's squeaky clean.
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.120]  He's gone to the dark side, and he's come back.
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.120]  Well, he's gone to the brain.
[47:48.120 --> 47:49.120]  He's gone to the brain.
[47:49.120 --> 47:50.120]  Because he stopped himself.
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  And the thing is, he was not trained for his entire life
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.120]  to be a Jedi.
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.120]  The part of the training...
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.120]  It's like too long to be sure.
[47:58.120 --> 48:01.120]  Like priest or whatever, where you were denying in our parlance
[48:01.120 --> 48:03.120]  because we just had map humans and everything.
[48:03.120 --> 48:05.120]  You're denying a part of your humanity.
[48:05.120 --> 48:06.120]  If you're going to be seldom,
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.120]  because you're a monk, it's like,
[48:07.120 --> 48:09.120]  well, that's important for your spiritual life and so on and so forth.
[48:09.120 --> 48:13.120]  But the number of humans who deal well with being seldom is very low
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.120]  because it's a strong urge that we have.
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.120]  And so wouldn't it be better if there was a philosophy
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.120]  that embraced everything that it means to be human
[48:19.120 --> 48:20.120]  and just took the good from that.
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.120]  And that's when the Jedi are in a bubble.
[48:22.120 --> 48:23.120]  Never mind that they're aliens
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.120]  and it doesn't really make any sense in that context anyway.
[48:25.120 --> 48:27.120]  Never mind, too, though.
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.120]  Also, let's say with the Catholic church
[48:31.120 --> 48:34.120]  where priests are celibate.
[48:34.120 --> 48:37.120]  There is no argument within church doctrine
[48:37.120 --> 48:40.120]  that what makes somebody a good priest
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.120]  is an inheritable quality, like genetic.
[48:44.120 --> 48:46.120]  Whereas with the Jedi, even in...
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.120]  Not even going to the second trilogy
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.120]  where they backwards rewrote in,
[48:52.120 --> 48:53.120]  the medical...
[48:53.120 --> 48:54.120]  Yeah, the medical...
[48:54.120 --> 48:55.120]  I was going to call it the M-word.
[48:55.120 --> 48:57.120]  But even in the first trilogy,
[48:57.120 --> 49:00.120]  they say the force is strong with the skywalkers and stuff.
[49:00.120 --> 49:03.120]  They even admit then that it's a genetic...
[49:03.120 --> 49:04.120]  It's a redditor, yeah.
[49:04.120 --> 49:05.120]  It doesn't make sense.
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.120]  Why in the world would the Jedi orders
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.120]  have everybody be celibate if the best source for new Jedi
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  would be their offspring?
[49:14.120 --> 49:17.120]  The celibacy angle makes sense in this respect
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.120]  because priests don't have super magical powers, right?
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.120]  So these individuals have tremendous power
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.120]  and if I had described what the whole purpose of the Jedi
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.120]  would be, it was like, look,
[49:29.120 --> 49:31.120]  some percentage of people in this universe
[49:31.120 --> 49:33.120]  would have this amazing magical power.
[49:33.120 --> 49:34.120]  They're just super dangerous.
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  So we need to get these kids young
[49:36.120 --> 49:39.120]  and we need to tamp down some aspects
[49:39.120 --> 49:41.120]  of human nature essentially.
[49:41.120 --> 49:43.120]  We need to get their tempers under control.
[49:43.120 --> 49:45.120]  We need to make it because it's very easy.
[49:45.120 --> 49:48.120]  If you give a five-year-old,
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  the ability to use the force and learn,
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.120]  but at the time they're 13-year-olds,
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.120]  they will have built up an amazing ability to use this force
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.120]  and they'll be very destructive
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.120]  and we need to act as a balance
[49:59.120 --> 50:02.120]  against the worst parts of human nature
[50:02.120 --> 50:03.120]  because if we don't,
[50:03.120 --> 50:05.120]  we're going to have a bunch of these people running around
[50:05.120 --> 50:07.120]  with their power would corrupt them.
[50:07.120 --> 50:08.120]  They may have been good people,
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.120]  but we need to get them early.
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  What we need to do is give them more of a monk-type mindset
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  because if we don't, we'll have a bunch of hothead,
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.120]  teenagers running around with super powers
[50:16.120 --> 50:19.120]  and that is a really bad formula for peace.
[50:19.120 --> 50:23.120]  I could come with the justification for why
[50:23.120 --> 50:25.120]  it's really important to find four sensitive kids young,
[50:25.120 --> 50:27.120]  get them into the program
[50:27.120 --> 50:29.120]  and teach them to,
[50:29.120 --> 50:30.120]  maybe they took it too far,
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.120]  like, total detachment in celibacy
[50:32.120 --> 50:34.120]  and whatever that I think is too far,
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.120]  but have them in a program
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.120]  that lets them deal with their emotions
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.120]  and understand that they have, you know,
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  with great power comes very responsibility
[50:42.120 --> 50:43.120]  to pull in from another movie
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.120]  that they have to deal with that in a certain way.
[50:45.120 --> 50:47.120]  So make some sense that the program for Jedi
[50:47.120 --> 50:49.120]  would be like, dude, chill.
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.120]  Otherwise you've got serious.
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.120]  Can you imagine teenagers with the force?
[50:54.120 --> 50:56.120]  It would be bad scene.
[50:56.120 --> 50:58.120]  Yeah.
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.120]  Let's take a break and we'll come back to that.
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  I'm going to come back to this question
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  of the Jedi Order.
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.120]  I want to thank our first sponsor
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.120]  and it's our very good friends at Backblaze.
[51:08.120 --> 51:09.120]  You guys know Backblaze.
[51:09.120 --> 51:12.120]  Online, unlimited,
[51:12.120 --> 51:15.120]  unthrottle backup for the Mac.
[51:15.120 --> 51:16.120]  You just go to their website,
[51:16.120 --> 51:19.120]  you download the software, put it on your Mac.
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.120]  You get a free month.
[51:22.120 --> 51:23.120]  You're done.
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.120]  Everything on your Mac.
[51:25.120 --> 51:26.120]  Your external hard drives.
[51:26.120 --> 51:27.120]  Your internal hard drive.
[51:27.120 --> 51:30.120]  It just syncs up to the Backblaze Cloud.
[51:30.120 --> 51:31.120]  Everything's there.
[51:31.120 --> 51:33.120]  You want to restore your whole disk.
[51:33.120 --> 51:34.120]  You can restore your whole disk.
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.120]  You can order a USB disk.
[51:36.120 --> 51:37.120]  They'll put everything on a USB disk.
[51:37.120 --> 51:39.120]  You pay them for the USB disk.
[51:39.120 --> 51:41.120]  Like they charge like wholesale prices.
[51:41.120 --> 51:42.120]  You don't pay a lot.
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.120]  Next day delivery, you get your disk.
[51:44.120 --> 51:45.120]  You want to restore one file?
[51:45.120 --> 51:46.120]  Just one file.
[51:46.120 --> 51:47.120]  You can do that too.
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.120]  You can do it from your iPhone.
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.120]  They have an iPhone app.
[51:50.120 --> 51:53.120]  You log in with your backblaze credentials.
[51:53.120 --> 51:54.120]  You can get one file.
[51:54.120 --> 51:57.120]  Send it from your phone, email it to somebody.
[51:57.120 --> 51:58.120]  You're done.
[51:58.120 --> 51:59.120]  You're not even near your Mac.
[51:59.120 --> 52:01.120]  You have access to your files.
[52:01.120 --> 52:04.120]  I've been talking about Backblaze for a year,
[52:04.120 --> 52:05.120]  probably two years.
[52:05.120 --> 52:07.120]  I can't believe that there are people who listen to the show
[52:07.120 --> 52:09.120]  who still haven't signed up for Backblaze.
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.120]  They keep coming back to sponsor the show,
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.120]  though, because people keep signing up.
[52:13.120 --> 52:15.120]  Sign up for Backblaze.
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.120]  I'm telling you right now, you won't regret it.
[52:19.120 --> 52:21.120]  You have nothing to lose.
[52:21.120 --> 52:23.120]  Free trial period.
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.120]  No credit card required.
[52:25.120 --> 52:27.120]  No add-ons, no gimmicks.
[52:27.120 --> 52:29.120]  You don't pay more if you have more data.
[52:29.120 --> 52:33.120]  Everybody just pays five bucks a month per Mac.
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.120]  No catch.
[52:35.120 --> 52:37.120]  Risk free, no credit card required.
[52:37.120 --> 52:38.120]  Here's where you go to sign up.
[52:38.120 --> 52:42.120]  Backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[52:42.120 --> 52:46.120]  Backblaze.com, which I can never pronounce correctly.
[52:46.120 --> 52:49.120]  Slash daring fireball.
[52:49.120 --> 52:53.120]  Jedi order.
[52:53.120 --> 52:55.120]  See, this is one of those things.
[52:55.120 --> 52:56.120]  Big picture.
[52:56.120 --> 53:00.120]  Big picture star wars to double trilogy.
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  The thing that has always stood out to me,
[53:02.120 --> 53:05.120]  even I thought even with the original trilogy
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.120]  by the time we got to return of the Jedi,
[53:07.120 --> 53:10.120]  that Lucas didn't really have all this shit worked out
[53:10.120 --> 53:11.120]  at the beginning.
[53:11.120 --> 53:13.120]  I mean, not even by a long shot.
[53:13.120 --> 53:15.120]  But then with the second trilogy,
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.120]  it just reeks to high hell of stuff that he made up on the fly.
[53:21.120 --> 53:25.120]  Like almost everything in the prequel trilogy to me
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.120]  shows, and it almost wrecks the stuff in the original trilogy.
[53:29.120 --> 53:31.120]  So I think it was great.
[53:31.120 --> 53:35.120]  I think it worked really well when you're doing Star Wars
[53:35.120 --> 53:38.120]  because you can just say stuff as throwaway lines
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.120]  and people can fill in the background
[53:40.120 --> 53:43.120]  because it's not particularly pertinent
[53:43.120 --> 53:47.120]  to the tale of destroying the Death Star, right?
[53:47.120 --> 53:50.120]  And Empire kind of builds on that a little bit
[53:50.120 --> 53:54.120]  because there was a flimsy enough sort of shell
[53:54.120 --> 53:57.120]  before that it could build into a bit.
[53:57.120 --> 54:00.120]  Return of the Jedi just kind of goes a little bit off the rails
[54:00.120 --> 54:03.120]  like I don't understand what's going on so much.
[54:03.120 --> 54:06.120]  But the prequel trilogy makes no sense at all.
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.120]  I don't understand the Jedi order.
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.120]  The Sith seemed like the most ineffective.
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.120]  Like really, there's only ever two of them.
[54:12.120 --> 54:13.120]  I don't get it.
[54:13.120 --> 54:16.120]  I don't understand the rationale for that at all
[54:16.120 --> 54:19.120]  or how that can be like a legitimate threat.
[54:19.120 --> 54:22.120]  To the Jedi order of thousands.
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  Yeah, it's, I don't know.
[54:24.120 --> 54:26.120]  Turns out they work because they took them out, but still.
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  I'm sure it's explained in the expanded universe
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.120]  that I haven't read, but it makes sense to me
[54:30.120 --> 54:34.120]  that kind of an evil organization
[54:34.120 --> 54:36.120]  where like Mike makes right.
[54:36.120 --> 54:40.120]  If you are mighty enough,
[54:40.120 --> 54:43.120]  there is no reason to have a bunch of henchmen hanging around.
[54:43.120 --> 54:45.120]  And so if they sit, they'll kill each other
[54:45.120 --> 54:46.120]  until there's only two left.
[54:46.120 --> 54:48.120]  I mean, I didn't listen to the talk show with Biscuits yet,
[54:48.120 --> 54:51.120]  but the title leads and relieves you can't do the same conclusion.
[54:51.120 --> 54:53.120]  Like why I have an apprentice then?
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.120]  Because the whole idea of the apprentice isn't going to kill it.
[54:55.120 --> 54:57.120]  But it's like a wolf pack where like eventually the lead wolf gets old
[54:57.120 --> 54:59.120]  and some other wolf challenges into a fight and wins.
[54:59.120 --> 55:01.120]  And then he's the head wolf.
[55:01.120 --> 55:02.120]  He's the alpha wolf, right?
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.120]  That type of model where the strongest survives
[55:06.120 --> 55:09.120]  and the Sith tradition, you can hang a lot of stuff on tradition
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.120]  because tradition is like,
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.120]  what does it make any rational sense to talk about?
[55:11.120 --> 55:12.120]  It's just the way it's always been done.
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.120]  Like the biggest, the biggest bad is the big bad,
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.120]  but you always got to have someone who's an apprentice
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.120]  because eventually you're going to get old and die or get defeated
[55:20.120 --> 55:21.120]  and we need someone to replace you.
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.120]  What we'd rather have happen is you train some guy up
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.120]  and eventually he gets stronger than you and defeats you
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.120]  and it's kind of like that's an honorable way for you to go out
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.120]  and it keeps the Sith going.
[55:30.120 --> 55:33.120]  And so it's not an entirely crazy system.
[55:33.120 --> 55:34.120]  Okay, fair enough.
[55:34.120 --> 55:39.120]  Fair enough, but two against the entire Jedi Order is weird.
[55:39.120 --> 55:42.120]  Also the way the Jedi Order sort of sits next
[55:42.120 --> 55:45.120]  to the Republican government.
[55:45.120 --> 55:49.120]  That's exactly what I think is a huge mistake.
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.120]  I felt like being an exile makes some sense
[55:53.120 --> 55:57.120]  because of the Empire Yoda and Obi-Wan are both old
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.120]  and they kind of have to hide.
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.120]  But I thought that the way that the Jedi were set up
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.120]  in the first trilogy was that they,
[56:05.120 --> 56:09.120]  not that they were all in hiding,
[56:09.120 --> 56:11.120]  but that they weren't centralized.
[56:11.120 --> 56:12.120]  There was an, you know.
[56:12.120 --> 56:14.120]  They were like knights or like samurai.
[56:14.120 --> 56:15.120]  Yeah, samurai.
[56:15.120 --> 56:17.120]  Well, samurai is exactly what I'm thinking.
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.120]  Where there's not like one central like samurai headquarters
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.120]  where all the samurai come out of, there's a tradition
[56:23.120 --> 56:25.120]  and there's a code, clearly there's a code
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.120]  and the training might be what would you call it?
[56:29.120 --> 56:30.120]  Regularize, you know,
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.120]  there's a systematic training to become a new one,
[56:32.120 --> 56:35.120]  but then once you do, you're all sort of lone wolves,
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.120]  you know, and they're, you know.
[56:37.120 --> 56:39.120]  Well, that's true because they give it.
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.120]  But you're serving, they're serving the good government
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  of like the Republic essentially.
[56:44.120 --> 56:47.120]  Like they would be the sort of benevolent enforcement arm.
[56:47.120 --> 56:48.120]  Like I think you could make, again,
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.120]  you could make an interesting sort of geopolitical thriller
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  about, look at this weird system of government,
[56:53.120 --> 56:55.120]  you know, where they have a kind of weird Jedi Order
[56:55.120 --> 56:56.120]  with these magic people.
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.120]  It's an uneasy truce with the democratically elected
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.120]  non-magic people.
[57:01.120 --> 57:02.120]  Like that could work out.
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  That's a different kind of movie.
[57:04.120 --> 57:07.120]  And you could see how a government could get into
[57:07.120 --> 57:08.120]  a really weird shape,
[57:08.120 --> 57:10.120]  especially if there's legitimate magic running around.
[57:10.120 --> 57:11.120]  They're like, well, who should run the show?
[57:11.120 --> 57:12.120]  Should it be those magic people?
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.120]  Or should we like vote for people?
[57:14.120 --> 57:16.120]  And that we're voting for a queen and she's a teenager.
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.120]  And like, this all sorts of government ends up
[57:19.120 --> 57:20.120]  in all sorts of weird distorted shapes.
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.120]  So I'm willing to believe any weird,
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.120]  a galactic government shape could work out.
[57:25.120 --> 57:27.120]  But if your movie's gonna be about that,
[57:27.120 --> 57:28.120]  then that's what your movie is about.
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  It's about like, well, how do we reconcile this thing?
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  And what if the magic people started to go crazy?
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  And what if the political people started to become a correctant?
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.120]  What are the checks and balances here?
[57:36.120 --> 57:38.120]  And how do empires fall and so on and so forth?
[57:38.120 --> 57:39.120]  Not the story.
[57:39.120 --> 57:40.120]  I was interested in hearing.
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.120]  I wanted to hear about Vader and Atticant,
[57:41.120 --> 57:43.120]  but that's a story.
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.120]  You know, right from the start in a Phantom menace,
[57:46.120 --> 57:49.120]  where the first thing we see is Qui-Gon and his, you know,
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.120]  Patawan Obi-Wan, you know, being sent by the Chancellor
[57:53.120 --> 57:57.120]  to do some, you know, fix a trade dispute or whatever.
[57:57.120 --> 58:01.120]  It's just, that just didn't seem to me what the Jedi were about.
[58:01.120 --> 58:03.120]  It didn't seem to me like the Jedi were people who did the bidding
[58:03.120 --> 58:06.120]  of the government, like cops, you know.
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.120]  Well, that's like, I mean, like night served the King, right?
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.120]  Yeah, like Samurai served their, their feudal master.
[58:12.120 --> 58:14.120]  Well, I loyalty to that, man.
[58:14.120 --> 58:16.120]  I think they were, what Ronan, I think is the right word.
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.120]  I thought I always imagined the Jedi as, as a sort of Ronan,
[58:20.120 --> 58:22.120]  you know, that they didn't serve a master.
[58:22.120 --> 58:24.120]  They served the force was their master.
[58:24.120 --> 58:26.120]  And like a natural sense of just truth and justice.
[58:26.120 --> 58:27.120]  Yeah, that would make sense.
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.120]  I mean, and then you don't have the Jedi Council at all.
[58:30.120 --> 58:33.120]  The thing you have basically a government, you could still do the government
[58:33.120 --> 58:35.120]  angle if they really into that was like, well, you've got through public,
[58:35.120 --> 58:38.120]  but what's the deal with these Jedi that don't serve any master,
[58:38.120 --> 58:39.120]  that are super powerful, that are running around,
[58:39.120 --> 58:41.120]  we're just supposed to trust that they're going to be like,
[58:41.120 --> 58:42.120]  benevolent or whatever.
[58:42.120 --> 58:46.120]  You can, the other angle you can go is like Merlin serving King Arthur.
[58:46.120 --> 58:48.120]  It's like, well, there's not that many of these guys,
[58:48.120 --> 58:49.120]  but they are running around.
[58:49.120 --> 58:52.120]  And we would like to have one in house,
[58:52.120 --> 58:53.120]  but there's other ones out there.
[58:53.120 --> 58:54.120]  How do you deal with wizards?
[58:54.120 --> 58:59.120]  How do you deal with people who are not constrained by any government
[58:59.120 --> 59:02.120]  and have powers that you don't understand it,
[59:02.120 --> 59:04.120]  but that are significantly powerful?
[59:04.120 --> 59:08.120]  Yeah, well, and then you could have something like that,
[59:08.120 --> 59:13.120]  where maybe one or a very small handful of Jedi could volunteer
[59:13.120 --> 59:18.120]  to be the handful of ones who serve the chancellor of the Senate
[59:18.120 --> 59:21.120]  or something like that, but not the whole order.
[59:21.120 --> 59:26.120]  I feel like, you know, they were like a sort of quasi-independent police force,
[59:26.120 --> 59:29.120]  which I thought was just way off for the tone that was set by the original.
[59:29.120 --> 59:33.120]  Well, and they did, once they bring in the whole youngling,
[59:33.120 --> 59:35.120]  and like the kids and everything, I mean,
[59:35.120 --> 59:37.120]  the presence for that was set in the movie
[59:37.120 --> 59:39.120]  when Luke shows up on Dagobah, he's like, he's too old.
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.120]  Yes, too old to begin the training.
[59:40.120 --> 59:42.120]  It's like, well, I remember when I watched a movie,
[59:42.120 --> 59:43.120]  I'm like, what do you mean too old?
[59:43.120 --> 59:44.120]  He's not too old.
[59:44.120 --> 59:46.120]  He's like, he's just barely an adult.
[59:46.120 --> 59:49.120]  Like, that's, isn't that the perfect time too?
[59:49.120 --> 59:52.120]  Like, when you would go into the army or be trained or whatever,
[59:52.120 --> 59:54.120]  but that comment from Yoda,
[59:54.120 --> 59:56.120]  and the prequels make clear that the whole idea was like,
[59:56.120 --> 59:58.120]  get him when they're young, get him like,
[59:58.120 --> 1:00:00.120]  and pull them away from their parents either.
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:02.120]  When their toddlers bring him in here,
[1:00:02.120 --> 1:00:04.120]  and again, my explanation for that,
[1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:05.120]  and my headcan is like, well,
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:07.120]  you really need to get them when they're young,
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:09.120]  because if you left of their own devices,
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  you'll have a serious problem.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:13.120]  So the whole order and system is like,
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:16.120]  that seems like it would be the most important function
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:17.120]  of the Jedi order.
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:19.120]  So if you're not using these people
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:21.120]  and bringing them into the art and training them,
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.120]  they could disperse that though.
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:24.120]  They don't have to remain and become a Jedi counselor
[1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.120]  so it's around a circle that makes pronouncements.
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  You don't need to do that,
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.120]  but once you've established that very young kids
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  get the force early, and the Yoda said
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:35.120]  that you need to be trained for a very young age,
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:38.120]  I think it's reasonable to stick with that and say,
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  there's gotta be like a school,
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:42.120]  like a school for gifted, you know,
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:43.120]  the same thing with the X-Men.
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  Like, if you don't get them into a Xavier school,
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:46.120]  they might end up following Magneto,
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:48.120]  even with just the original trilogy,
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:50.120]  even not even going to the prequel trilogy,
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  I always thought that Yoda's protestations in that scene
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.120]  were, he was just playing hard to get
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:59.120]  to make Luke work.
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:00.120]  I don't know about that.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  No intention, any matter.
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:03.120]  Because even from what we only know
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:04.120]  from the original trilogy,
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  we know that Ben lived near Luke his entire life
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.120]  and that he'd sort of had a, you know,
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:11.120]  and they'd met each other before.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.120]  He knew him as Ben and, you know,
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  they'd met each other before.
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:17.120]  It wasn't the first time that they met
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:20.120]  when he rescued him from the Sam people.
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:23.120]  So Obi-Wan Kenobi clearly purposefully
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  for the first 20 years of Luke's life
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  never even mentioned the force to him,
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  not even like as, like, telling stories.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.120]  Like, Luke didn't even know what a lightsaber was.
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:34.120]  Yeah, they have a timing problem with the prequels too.
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.120]  It's like, you're, you're to tell me
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:38.120]  that these Jedi were around,
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.120]  but then within one generation,
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  they're so forgotten
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  that, that I don't believe they exist.
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:44.120]  And Luke doesn't know what a lightsaber was.
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.120]  If every kid in our world,
[1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:48.120]  where the Jedi are fictional,
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  knows what a lightsaber is,
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:52.120]  how in the world doesn't every kid in that galaxy?
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  Like, even if Vader had killed them all
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  just before you were born,
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:56.120]  you're still going to know about them,
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.120]  like the half, you know.
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:01:59.120]  Right, we just, we know recorded.
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  In the same the way that,
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:03.120]  in the same way that we all know who the samurai were.
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.120]  Right, exactly, right.
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:06.120]  So that, I mean, that's a timing wise, that's a problem.
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.120]  But when, when Yoda said he saw all the reason
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:09.120]  that he stood out to me
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  because he seems to be the perfect age
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:13.120]  and the fact that Yoda would pull out
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:15.120]  the two-old and that, you know,
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  because it would be ridiculous.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:18.120]  Like, well, it would say like, he's too short.
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  Like, it would be the same.
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:20.120]  But what do you mean he's too short?
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  He's like average height for a person seems fine.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  Maybe Jedi have to be super short, right?
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:25.120]  So when he said he's too old,
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.120]  he wouldn't pull that out.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.120]  And yes, he didn't want to train him
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:28.120]  he was trying to back out or whatever,
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.120]  but why pull up something so preposterous?
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  And the answer is it's not preposterous
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  that Jedi actually are trained from a super young age
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  and you don't usually get him by the time they're,
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.120]  they're practically an adult because by then
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  it's their, their two set in their ways.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:44.120]  So it doesn't make much sense in the context of Luke,
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.120]  because again, my whole rationale of wanting them young
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:48.120]  is like, they should be feeling the force
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:51.120]  when they're very young and by the time they get that old,
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  they'll just be like, completely reckless force users
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:55.120]  whereas Luke has no idea that he even has the force
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:56.120]  until I knew hope so.
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:57.120]  Well, there's two things.
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  A, I don't believe for a second
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.120]  that Yoda did not intend to train Luke.
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  He's just saying that because he wants to see how Luke reacts.
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  That's why he's testing him.
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  No, he's taking his argument with Obi-Wan
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:10.120]  because he doesn't.
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:11.120]  What's he going to do?
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:14.120]  And then just let, let the galaxy go on being the way it is.
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  No.
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:17.120]  But he, like he's out of the game.
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:18.120]  Like he's on Dagoboy's hanging around.
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  He's looking at the animals and the lizard and stuff.
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:21.120]  He's kind of checked out.
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  Like he's trying to pull him back in.
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.120]  Like can you train one more dead eyes?
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:28.120]  I think it's a, at best, a protest station.
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  Like I don't want to get out of bed.
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  Fine.
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:32.120]  I know I've got to get out of bed and train this guy.
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:34.120]  I mean, the thing with me to think,
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.120]  well, yeah, it is a legitimate argument.
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:38.120]  And, and this is where I back you up is the,
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:44.120]  um, Luke doesn't believe he can lift the X-wing.
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:47.120]  And that goes to him being too old because he's got an experience
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  and he's got, um, like he, he understands how heavy one of these things.
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:52.120]  Yeah, that's been like the other I'm like.
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:53.120]  And like to old.
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  Yeah.
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:55.120]  You know, it's like,
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.120]  there's no way you fail.
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  You can't, you don't believe in this stuff enough.
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:01.120]  It's like in the Matrix when the little kid has no problem, you know,
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.120]  you know, there is no spoon and when you're older, you're like,
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  well, you mean the spoon is totally there and it's harder
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:07.120]  because you're more set in your ways.
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  That's the, that's the other angle for him being too old.
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:12.120]  I think it's, it's the least,
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:15.120]  his age is the least of the problems with the chronology there.
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  The boy is reckless.
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:17.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:19.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:21.120]  I think the, the, the, the empire, just,
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.120]  it should have been around for like hundreds of years of this.
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:24.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:25.120]  It should not have been only 15 years old.
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:27.120]  And in fact, they don't say that though.
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  Well, they do say before the empire because you could have had a benevolent empire.
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:31.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  And maybe the flowers,
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.120]  but you don't know how old Obi-Wan is.
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  He could, you don't know how long life spans are in this universe.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.120]  And he's a Jedi and Yoda is super old too.
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  And like, there are many outs.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:46.120]  Like the chronology made sense when you just had the original trilogy.
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:47.120]  Yes.
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.120]  But when you, when you connect it up in the way they did,
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  then you're like, then you think,
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:51.120]  because it was open.
[1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:53.120]  It's like, everyone forgot about the Jedi.
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  I mean, I know you're on Tatooine and it's far away and stuff,
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  but seriously, man, like you get TV and like.
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:58.120]  Yeah.
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:01.120]  I mean, what, what does the even cause tells Vader it's an ancient,
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:03.120]  you're the last practitioner that ancient religion?
[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:04.120]  Yeah, it's not too ancient.
[1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:05.120]  It's like, you know.
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:07.120]  Yeah, it's like 20 years out of day.
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:08.120]  What do you, you can?
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:10.120]  I have like computers that still work better that old.
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.120]  Right.
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:12.120]  Yeah.
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:13.120]  Yeah.
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.120]  I always, yeah, I always just had the vague sense,
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:17.120]  just as a rough kind of knowledge.
[1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:18.120]  And whether it actually worked out or not,
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:21.120]  but that let's say like in that scene on the Death Star,
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:22.120]  where the guy is saying, you know,
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:24.120]  you're the last practitioner of that thing,
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:27.120]  that at least the age of the empire and the age
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:31.120]  when the Jedi were either dominant for us,
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:35.120]  missing or reduced to just a handful hidden around the galaxy,
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:38.120]  was around the length of those men's ages.
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  That guy was born in a world where the Jedi were already decimated.
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.120]  Yes.
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:45.120]  Like 35, 40 years.
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:46.120]  Yeah.
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:48.120]  You know, because if it wasn't, you know,
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:50.120]  it's sort of like for what, for like people like us,
[1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:53.120]  like the world without TV.
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:55.120]  Like we know that there was a world without TV.
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:57.120]  We believe in a world without TV,
[1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:59.120]  but we don't, we haven't experienced it,
[1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:01.120]  because it predates our life, you know,
[1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:03.120]  our us being born, it seems ancient.
[1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:05.120]  Or even black and white TV.
[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:07.120]  Black and white TV seems ancient to me.
[1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.120]  It's intellectually fathomable,
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:12.120]  but kind of viscerally just you can't really picture it.
[1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:13.120]  Right.
[1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  Whereas if I was maybe 10 years older,
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:16.120]  then black and white TV would just seem like something
[1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:17.120]  from my childhood.
[1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:18.120]  Exactly.
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:19.120]  Yeah.
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:22.120]  And the other angle you can go to explain the chronology
[1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:24.120]  is the backwater thing where,
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.120]  yeah, these things were around,
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:28.120]  but information is not evenly distributed.
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:32.120]  And so if you are really far away from all the action
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:34.120]  on some remote planet,
[1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:37.120]  maybe you're not interested in the history of the Republic
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:40.120]  or any sort of pan-galactic government or anything like that.
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:43.120]  And maybe you just, you know, like the Jedi story,
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.120]  we heard some of our stories
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:45.120]  because Japan's not too far away.
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:47.120]  And we had a war with them.
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.120]  And we know about Japanese stuff in their culture
[1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:50.120]  came over here.
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:51.120]  How much culture about,
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:52.120]  maybe Tatooine,
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:53.120]  they didn't get any culture about the Jedi.
[1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:54.120]  And it still doesn't,
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:55.120]  as John said,
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:56.120]  that our whole Ben is down the street.
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:06:57.120]  He's purposely not mentioning it.
[1:06:57.120 --> 1:06:59.120]  And maybe that's part of his strategy of keeping an eye
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:00.120]  and put him in a backwater
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:02.120]  where they've never even heard of the Jedi.
[1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.120]  You can kind of explain it,
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:05.120]  but once you get like Han Solo,
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:07.120]  it was supposedly been jetting all over the galaxy.
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:08.120]  And he's like,
[1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.120]  I'd never seen anything that made me think all powerful for it.
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:11.120]  You'd never seen anything.
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:13.120]  Like, you should have seen like movies of Jedi,
[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.120]  but things with their mind.
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:16.120]  And you'd be like,
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.120]  all right, well, I guess that was a thing.
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.120]  Yeah.
[1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:19.120]  And then in the new trilogy,
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:20.120]  I mean, again,
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:21.120]  he's supposedly super, super powerful,
[1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:23.120]  but we see Anakin as a kid
[1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:25.120]  doing some things that would require the Force.
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:27.120]  You know, that if,
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:28.120]  just because the Jedi are decimated,
[1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:30.120]  doesn't mean that human beings
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:32.120]  who have force-related powers,
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:34.120]  you know, that you wouldn't run into them
[1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:38.120]  with what we can only assume to be the wide variety of action
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  that Han Solo has seen, you know,
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:43.120]  here to foreign is, is adventures.
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:44.120]  Well, I mean, Anakin's whole thing was like,
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:45.120]  he's got Jedi reflexes.
[1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:47.120]  He's the only human who can pod race.
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:48.120]  He could just be a child pro.
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:50.120]  Do you have amazing reflexes at that point?
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:51.120]  You don't necessarily have to, you know,
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:54.120]  he's not moving salt shakers for this mind quite yet.
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:56.120]  I just, I bet I just think that if a seven-year-old
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:58.120]  is showing those type of abilities
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:00.120]  that Han Solo would have seen, you know,
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.120]  something, a guy who could cheat at dice, you know,
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.120]  in a casino because he can...
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:07.120]  Yeah, I mean, there's no explanation for Han Solo being so doubt.
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:09.120]  I mean, other than the fact that it works
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:10.120]  in the context of the original trilogy,
[1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.120]  but as soon as you tack on the prequels with that timeline
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:14.120]  between them and all of a sudden,
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:17.120]  everything in a new hope doesn't read as true.
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:19.120]  Yeah, you have to be willfully stupid at that point.
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:20.120]  Yeah.
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:25.120]  So I want to touch on some of the writing things
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:28.120]  that to me just clearly showed
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:30.120]  that it wasn't thought out in advance.
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:32.120]  And I'm going to say this though before I do that.
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  There's so many writing complaints that we can do
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  and should do, and I think it's fundamental
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.120]  to the prequels emptiness.
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  I'll say though, I'll forgive Lucas
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.120]  for those expositional problems,
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  like Luke not knowing what a lightsaber is
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.120]  or the forces, I'll forgive those completely
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:52.120]  because of the need to explain to us the audience
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:54.120]  what those things are.
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:57.120]  And yes, it was a little clumsy if you try to,
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:00.120]  if you really think about it, it thinks a little clumsy,
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:04.120]  but in hindsight though overall it was a good scene.
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:06.120]  I remember very fondly looking back on that scene
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:09.120]  in Obi-Wan's house where he gets the lightsaber
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:12.120]  and turns it on and hears about the Jedi in the first...
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  That scene is perfectly acceptable if the prequels don't exist.
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:16.120]  It's perfect because he really wouldn't have known.
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  He's a farm boy.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  How would he know about this?
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  The farm boy shows up to the old man.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  The old man shows him something from a box.
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:23.120]  It's an ancient thing.
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:25.120]  It's a device.
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:26.120]  Yeah, you get someone who's naive
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.120]  and then you have the wiser person to explain to them
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:29.120]  and you really explain to the audience.
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  So it works perfectly in the context of that story.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:33.120]  I think it would be a little bit more elegant
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:35.120]  if it was a little bit more, and I hate to say it,
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:38.120]  but a little bit more like the scene in a Phantom Menace
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:41.120]  where young Anakin
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.120]  asks if he's a Jedi because he's, you know,
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:46.120]  he sees his laser sword.
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:47.120]  He doesn't even know the name lightsaber,
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:50.120]  but it's like, even if Luke had just said,
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  you know, it just expressed some sort of,
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  I've heard of lightsabers, but never believed I'd see one.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:57.120]  You wanted to be more mysterious than that.
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:00.120]  You don't want Neo to know about the Matrix before.
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:03.120]  You want him to be a complete Neo fight
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:05.120]  because he's got his arc is he's a farm boy
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:08.120]  who dreams something more and is wider world opens up to him.
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:10.120]  So I'm perfectly happy with him not knowing it all.
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:12.120]  And the explanation as delivered by Alec Guinness
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:15.120]  put so laid back and not going into a lot of detail.
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:17.120]  Like, sure as hell, not mentioning midi chlorines.
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.120]  It's like two or three sentences.
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:22.120]  It's the type of explanation you would get if this guy's like,
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  I've decided that I'm gonna bring you on board this thing,
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:27.120]  but I can't explain it all to you now.
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:28.120]  Let me just give you the broad strokes
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:29.120]  and let's move on to the next scene
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:30.120]  because we gotta go to most eyes.
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:31.120]  Right.
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:34.120]  And it's a, well, you know, Luke is our, you know,
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  he's there for us.
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:38.120]  We see that, we see that whole thing through Luke's eyes.
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  And up until that point in the movie,
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:42.120]  you know, it's actually,
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.120]  it's not like this hybrid fantasy science fiction combo.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:47.120]  It's more just science fiction.
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:49.120]  It's just spaceships and laser guns.
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.120]  And then all of a sudden in that scene,
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:55.120]  we're, we're explained that it's also little magic.
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:57.120]  And that movie, I know hope is not force heavy.
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:59.120]  Like it's like, all right, light sabers, forest Jedi,
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:00.120]  guest Vader's got one.
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:02.120]  It's an excuse to have a sword fight,
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:04.120]  but like really Luke is like,
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.120]  he's not.
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:06.120]  I think it's only the mind.
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:08.120]  I think it's only the mind trick that is,
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:09.120]  that is magic.
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:11.120]  They don't even do the force move stuff.
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:12.120]  That kind of thing.
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.120]  Yeah, but what I'm saying is like Luke,
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.120]  what Luke dreams about is being a pilot.
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  Like he wants to fly a spaceship and he's interested
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:18.120]  in the rebellion.
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:19.120]  You know about the rebellion.
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  He's totally interested in their rebellion.
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:22.120]  So he's like, he's a, like he's a liberal basically.
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  Like he's against the Empire.
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  He's four, he's four of the rebellion.
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.120]  He just wants big says friend has gone off into war
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:29.120]  to join the rebellion.
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.120]  And he's totally into flying things.
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.120]  And like he's, he's a young punk who, you know,
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  wants to get off this think and rock and do great things.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:40.120]  And none of that has anything to do with the force or swords
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:42.120]  or sword fighting or moving things with your mind.
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.120]  It's totally the second movie gets him into that.
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  And the first movie he's just like, you know,
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.120]  it's like a coming of age story and going off to the war.
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  And even though he does a little bit of force stuff,
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:53.120]  like it's like Obi-Wan says taking me first step
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  into a larger world, he has.
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  But that larger world does not yet interest him.
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  And he doesn't realize the importance of it until more or less
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  he sees Obi-Wan disappear in a puff of smoke.
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  And then starts talking to him through his, you know,
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:05.120]  he can hear him in his mind.
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.120]  He's like, hmm, maybe there's something to this force thing.
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:11.120]  And in that aspect of it, I do think was loosely plotted out
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:14.120]  by Lucas, where here in this first movie,
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:17.120]  the force is really just for Vader and Obi-Wan
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  and Luke gets a taste of it.
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  He gets a few drops on his tongue, you know.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  And it helps him have final victory in the movie.
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:28.120]  In the end, his piling skills are not enough
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:30.120]  and he has to, you know, use the force.
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:31.120]  That's the whole big takeaway from him.
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  And that's the climax of the movie.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:33.120]  But what has he done?
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.120]  He's barely scratched the surface of like,
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:38.120]  he didn't find anyone lights there for the whole movie, right?
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:40.120]  He got shot in the butt by the little floaty ball.
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.120]  But in the end, it was all, I mean, the movie resonated so much.
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:45.120]  It was, you know, the, the force stuff is like,
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.120]  it's a little bit of a lot ofitism of turn off your targeting computer.
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:51.120]  But like, you know, the, the things that are inside you,
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.120]  your emotions and feelings and thoughts are that feel so powerful inside you
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:58.120]  can actually have an external manifestation of that power
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.120]  and that will lead you to victory.
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:02.120]  And it will be a good victory in the rest of our blow up
[1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.120]  and no one else could have made that shot and so on and so forth.
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:05.120]  All right.
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.120]  I think, and I know this might be controversial, I think.
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.120]  And I think John, you and I have even talked about this.
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.120]  I think that when Lucas wrote Star Wars,
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:18.120]  or what I call Star Wars, the new hope episode four.
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:21.120]  And I think he thought if this is a hit and I get to make
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:23.120]  the rest of the trilogy, you know, that was the whole thing.
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:25.120]  It's like, I've got to make this first one.
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:27.120]  And if it's successful, Holy shit, then I can, you know,
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:30.120]  worry, I can write and finish, you know, that's plan trilogy.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:33.120]  I think he wrote it with the idea that Luke was going to be
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.120]  the guy who gets the girl.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  I think so.
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:39.120]  Yeah, that's a reason.
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.120]  And the whole first movie completely supports that.
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:42.120]  Right.
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:45.120]  I don't think there was any plan at all for Leia to be his sister.
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.120]  No, I think he did plan on Vader being his father.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:49.120]  I mean, and there's the whole thing where Vader's,
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.120]  I think the German word for father.
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:54.120]  I think that might have been there.
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:56.120]  Although I'm still not even convinced of that,
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:59.120]  because when Obi-Wan tells him that Vader,
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:04.120]  that Vader, he was killed by Vader, killed by Vader.
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:08.120]  It plays well in hindsight, but I can't help but think that
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:10.120]  and from what we know of Luke is overall,
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:12.120]  if that's what he thought overall,
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:14.120]  he would have overplayed it and it would have been like,
[1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:16.120]  he killed his father.
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:17.120]  So if you watch the scene,
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:20.120]  I just actually, as it happens, I just watched that scene
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:22.120]  just before coming on this podcast.
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:24.120]  And there's two ways you can take it.
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:26.120]  One way, if you look at it with hindsight,
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:29.120]  it is acted perfectly to be like,
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:30.120]  do you love me?
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:33.120]  No, he's thinking of what he's going to say.
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:34.120]  How is he going to say?
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:35.120]  He knows he's going to lie, right?
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.120]  In hindsight, he can look like that.
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.120]  The other way that the same performance
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:41.120]  from Alec Guinness can look is,
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:43.120]  you don't want to tell kid what happened to his father,
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:44.120]  especially if his father died.
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  I'm like, oh, don't ask him about your father.
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:49.120]  I got to tell you that he was killed by Darth Vader
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:53.120]  and it's unpleasant and the same performance
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:56.120]  like either one of those things reads on it perfectly.
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:14:58.120]  Obviously the one with hindsight, like, oh,
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:14:59.120]  it's totally that performance,
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:01.120]  but it could also just as easily be a little kid
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  just asked me about his father.
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:05.120]  And I know his father was killed.
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:07.120]  He didn't die peacefully in his sleep.
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:09.120]  He was killed by Darth Vader.
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:10.120]  Darth Vader is a bad guy.
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:12.120]  He's leading most people who are like,
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:14.120]  it reads that way as well.
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:16.120]  I don't know if Luke is told Alec Guinness,
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  by the way, when Luke asks about what happened to his father,
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:21.120]  you're going to be essentially lying.
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:22.120]  Even if I can't tell you what did happen to his father,
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.120]  what you're going to tell him isn't the truth.
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.120]  So play the whole thing.
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:28.120]  I get the feeling that Luke is made up
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:30.120]  of Vader being his father in the second one.
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.120]  And I get the feeling that he just went back,
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:35.120]  in so many things in Jedi,
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:37.120]  I feel that he just went back to the well.
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:38.120]  He made another Death Star.
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:40.120]  Like that, even as a kid,
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.120]  I found that kind of boring.
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:42.120]  But no, but it makes it.
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:43.120]  It makes a nice circle.
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:44.120]  Sure.
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:46.120]  Again, I was thinking of a new hope when
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:48.120]  when 3PO is going to the oil bath
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:51.120]  and I forgot Luke was talking to him
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.120]  or whatever.
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:53.120]  And he's like, you know, I'm just a protocol droid.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.120]  And not very good at telling stories.
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:56.120]  Like throw away lines like that.
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:58.120]  They get paid off two movies later.
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:15:59.120]  I'll give you that one.
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:00.120]  So I agree.
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:04.120]  But I do think that he shoehorned Leia into being part
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:08.120]  of the Skywalker family in Jedi,
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  because I think he felt that he needed
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:13.120]  the reveal that was akin to the one in Empire.
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:15.120]  But he did in Empire.
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  He said, no, there is another.
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  So he's got to pay off.
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:18.120]  There is another.
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:20.120]  I'm glad he didn't leave that dangling.
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:21.120]  The another one.
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:22.120]  Yeah.
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:25.120]  It's mostly immaterial unless they build on that in Episode 7.
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:26.120]  So it's mostly immaterial.
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  It's like basically says there's another
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:30.120]  which means that like basically that's there
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:32.120]  to let you know that Luke could conceivably
[1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:33.120]  die in Empire.
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:34.120]  And he came pretty darn close to dying.
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:36.120]  Like to make you think, guess what, guys?
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:38.120]  I'm willing to kill off the main character
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:39.120]  because there is another.
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.120]  And it just so happens that he turns out that he lives.
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:43.120]  And in a Jedi way find out who the other is.
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:44.120]  But it's mostly inconsequential.
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.120]  Because hey, Luke is alive.
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:47.120]  If Luke, again, if Luke had died a Jedi,
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:49.120]  then the other would be what
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:52.120]  we would be hanging our hat on for the future.
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:58.120]  I mean, the consequence is that it makes Luke go ballistic
[1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:00.120]  and ultimately defeat Vader through anger, right?
[1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.120]  I mean, it was it was working to the movie.
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:06.120]  It's just like talking about making it up as you go along.
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:09.120]  I'm willing to believe that like having Vader turn out
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:10.120]  to be his father, fine.
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:11.120]  That works.
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.120]  But how many surprised familiar relationships
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  that you allowed in a trilogy?
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:15.120]  Right.
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  Because he's pushing it by saying, oh,
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:17.120]  and guess what?
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:18.120]  Another main character is also related to you.
[1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.120]  Really?
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:21.120]  Is everybody related to me?
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:22.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:23.120]  It could have been.
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:24.120]  It didn't have to be a sister.
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  It could have just been that Leia was the other one.
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:29.120]  I mean, exactly.
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:30.120]  Late and untapped force.
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:31.120]  Right.
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:32.120]  And what's next?
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  I'm going to cite Darth Vader.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:34.120]  I mean, C-3P.
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:34.120]  I'll come on.
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:35.120]  It's ridiculous.
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:36.120]  And actually he does.
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:37.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:38.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.120]  But he does.
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:45.120]  Like, do the Vulcan mind chat with Leia as her escaping best man?
[1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:48.120]  No, who the other is.
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:52.120]  And the fact that they can have that communication with each other
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:55.120]  is either they're related, or they're both geodides, or both.
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:57.120]  And either one would be semi-plausible.
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.120]  Because there's plenty of movies you're like, oh, I just feel
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.120]  that my non-magical movies, like I have somehow
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:05.120]  feel like my brother is in a terrible car.
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:07.120]  People totally buy into that stuff.
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.120]  Especially for the movie.
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:11.120]  And this movie, we have established telepathic links
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:13.120]  between people, even when one of them is dead.
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.120]  The first movie I'm talking about.
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:17.120]  Ben is in his ear saying, you know, use the Force,
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:18.120]  Luke, or whatever.
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:20.120]  So as soon as he's communicate, tell it about the movie.
[1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:22.120]  Well, I guess she's the other.
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.120]  See, and I think, and if you look, remember the original posters
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:29.120]  and it's like the even the Star Wars logo is a little different.
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:30.120]  And maybe even a lot different.
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:32.120]  It's still got like the connected letters,
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:36.120]  but it's like in a different, almost like a pyramid shape.
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:40.120]  And it's like, it's a lot more stylized.
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:42.120]  I don't know that any of the characters quite look like
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:44.120]  the likenesses of the actual actors.
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:47.120]  But Luke is holding his lightsaber above his head.
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:48.120]  It's chest.
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:49.120]  He's got his big chest coming out.
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:51.120]  And Leia is wrapped around his leg.
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:53.120]  Leia is wrapped around his leg.
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:57.120]  To me, that poster gets authorized
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:01.120]  because it's a tale of this boy from a farm,
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:05.120]  which is what it ended up being who goes on this grand adventure
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:07.120]  and gets the girl.
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:08.120]  Well, he rescues the princess.
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:09.120]  He rescues her.
[1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:12.120]  They swing across the canyon on a rope together.
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  And she gives him a kiss for that for luck.
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:17.120]  And then there's the famous kiss on Hoth.
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:18.120]  Right.
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:20.120]  Well, by that time you're doing actual romance.
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.120]  And then the first movie was so gentle.
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:23.120]  Yeah.
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:25.120]  But Disney, even Disney movie has like bell kiss
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:26.120]  the beast and ellipse at the end.
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:28.120]  But it's Star Wars.
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.120]  There's no kissing on the lips.
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.120]  It's just like all kind of, it's understood
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:33.120]  that Luke has saved the princess.
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  Nothing is as sexual though as that poster.
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:39.120]  Right.
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:41.120]  And because that was the way they did movie posters.
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:42.120]  Like you had to promise.
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:44.120]  Even if there's no actual sex in the movie,
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:45.120]  you have to promise there's going to be a guy
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:47.120]  that's going to be a girl.
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.120]  And the girl is going to be a submissive princess
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:50.120]  who wraps yourself around the hero's leg.
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:52.120]  And the hero's chest is going to be gigantic.
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:54.120]  I mean, Mark Hamill's chest is not gigantic.
[1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:57.120]  But on his posters, it's busting out of his white tunic.
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.120]  You know, it's just the way they advertise things.
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:01.120]  I'm looking at it now.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:04.120]  And if I'm correct, and Han and Chewie,
[1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.120]  I don't think are even in it.
[1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:09.120]  There's a big Vader behind him.
[1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:10.120]  But it's Han.
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:14.120]  It's Luke and Leia and the droids.
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:15.120]  Yeah.
[1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:16.120]  And it's a good call.
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:18.120]  If you're going to call an audible,
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:19.120]  it's a good call.
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.120]  It's the reason empire is so great.
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:22.120]  It's because after the first movie,
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:24.120]  you've got the childhood fairytale.
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:26.120]  We're going to save the princess.
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:28.120]  Luke gets to swing across the canyon with her.
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.120]  They get medals at the end.
[1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:32.120]  The leg gives them a special smile during the medal ceremony.
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:34.120]  It's appropriate for pre-pubescent boys
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.120]  who understand the concept of getting the girl or whatever.
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  But once you're about to make the second movie,
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:41.120]  you say, you know what?
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:45.120]  Leia, actually, the bickering layer did with Han
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:48.120]  is a better indication of a budding romantic relationship
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:50.120]  than anything that happened between Leia and Luke.
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:52.120]  And that is a much more interesting relationship.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.120]  So why don't we go in that direction for Empire?
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:55.120]  And it did.
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:20:56.120]  And it was smart.
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:20:58.120]  And again, it doesn't have to be Luke's sister to do that.
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:01.120]  Because that is the actual relationship with chemistry.
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:04.120]  And chemistry between Luke and Leia for the second movie
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:05.120]  to build.
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:08.120]  Well, I don't know about that at the time when I first saw it.
[1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:10.120]  Probably not because I was very young.
[1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  But you can tell when she kisses Luke that it's basically
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:16.120]  just to get it on.
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:19.120]  It's got very little to do with kissing Luke.
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:21.120]  And Luke is not ready to handle.
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  Luke is putting his hands behind his head going,
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:25.120]  oh, a girl kissed me.
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:26.120]  It's like this.
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:27.120]  Yeah.
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:29.120]  And Han is, you know.
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:31.120]  Yeah, but he plays the coolest.
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  Yeah, I take care of kid.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:33.120]  But take care of his head.
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.120]  Luke is not as far as we know.
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.120]  Luke hasn't even had a girlfriend here.
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.120]  Whereas Han is, you know, is worldly wise.
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:41.120]  Yeah.
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:43.120]  Like he's wise enough chemistry.
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:44.120]  Yeah.
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:46.120]  He's not even upset with Luke or anything.
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:47.120]  He's just like, OK.
[1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:51.120]  Well, basically he's resigned that she won that argument.
[1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:52.120]  Right.
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:53.120]  He still knows.
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:55.120]  He still knows it's the two of them.
[1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:57.120]  And Luke is just a bystander in his head.
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:58.120]  That's exactly it.
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:21:59.120]  Yeah.
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  That's the way he plays it.
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:01.120]  And Luke just got the only part of Empire
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:03.120]  planning over Leia or thinking about Leia.
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.120]  And as anyway, except for a friend,
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:07.120]  like when he's having these trances on Dagobo,
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:08.120]  he's like, oh, Leia.
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.120]  Like in terms of his friends, he's got to save his friends.
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:15.120]  He's not hung up on Leia at all.
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:16.120]  Right.
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:20.120]  Speaking about sort of the beginning part of Empire,
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:22.120]  what I loved, because I, you know,
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:24.120]  I have to be decided we couldn't do this.
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.120]  Of course, I watched them all over again.
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:32.120]  The story of Han in the first one ends with him,
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:34.120]  basically turning around and saving the day.
[1:22:34.120 --> 1:22:35.120]  Right.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:37.120]  Or at least helping Luke save the day.
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:41.120]  And then we come immediately into Empire Strikes Back.
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:43.120]  And we keep building on that.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.120]  Like, as soon as he finds out that Luke is out in the cold,
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:48.120]  he's willing to die to go get him.
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  Like, the character progression
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  starts exactly where it ended.
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:54.120]  Like, Han had already decided that, like,
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.120]  no, he's all in, he's committed to saving,
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:22:58.120]  like, these people are his friends,
[1:22:58.120 --> 1:22:59.120]  and he's going to go help them.
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:02.120]  And we don't, but we don't repeat the arc.
[1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:03.120]  You know, we don't need to repeat the arc.
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.120]  It's like, immediately he's jumping on his taunt on
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:07.120]  and seeing people in hand.
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:09.120]  He's a continuation of the arc of, like,
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:11.120]  he's being chased because he's got a price on his head.
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:12.120]  Like, we know.
[1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:13.120]  Well, there's that.
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.120]  But we don't see him being the scandal to his friends anymore.
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  Like, he's completely dedicated.
[1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:19.120]  Oh, yeah, no.
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:21.120]  He goes out for Luke,
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:23.120]  and when the Imperials attack the base,
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:25.120]  he immediately goes to get Leia and try to,
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:26.120]  try to get her out.
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:28.120]  Like, that's the first thing he does.
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:32.120]  And we've had time removed because the end of a new hope
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:33.120]  and the beginning of Empire,
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:35.120]  there's a substantial amount of time during which
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  there's more, like, that they've been to war together.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:39.120]  So now they're essentially not just friends,
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:40.120]  but war buddies.
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.120]  Yeah.
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:42.120]  There's hijinks in there.
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:43.120]  There's what it might do.
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:44.120]  Well, exactly.
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  But that, to me, is, like, the brilliant,
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:48.120]  that's, like, Star Wars at its best,
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:49.120]  is the Ord Van Delft story,
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:51.120]  where it's just, they just mention it.
[1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:53.120]  It's a cool sounding name.
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:55.120]  You know, something happened.
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:57.120]  You know, there's just this,
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:23:59.120]  in the quickest way possible,
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:01.120]  simply through dialogue,
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:02.120]  they just imply,
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.120]  and it feels genuine,
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:05.120]  that they've been through some shit
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:06.120]  in between the two movies,
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  and we haven't seen it.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:08.120]  Yeah.
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:10.120]  And it reminds you that bounty hunters exist
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:11.120]  in the universe,
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  which comes in later.
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:13.120]  Right.
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  And a thereafter.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:15.120]  Yeah.
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:16.120]  All right.
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:17.120]  I think, I can't,
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:18.120]  I could do a whole show just on Empire
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.120]  because I think Empire,
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:21.120]  I think Empire is what,
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:22.120]  what holds the whole thing together.
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  I think Star Wars was clearly, you know,
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:25.120]  the original one,
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:26.120]  was a huge sensation.
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  It was the biggest,
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:29.120]  pop cultural, you know,
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:31.120]  movie of the whole series.
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:33.120]  Nothing is ever going to top that.
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:35.120]  But the one that makes it something
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:36.120]  that we're going to keep hoping
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:38.120]  for sequels that are good is Empire.
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:39.120]  I agree.
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:40.120]  I mean, how old?
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.120]  When, when else has there been a sequel
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  that is, you know,
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:45.120]  as good or better than originally?
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  It's got, got fun too.
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.120]  It was the other thing.
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:48.120]  Got fun too.
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:49.120]  Aliens, aliens.
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:51.120]  Here's the thing about maybe aliens.
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  But here's the thing about Star Wars or Zempire.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:57.120]  Empire took it to another level.
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  Like it's not just because
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:24:59.120]  a godfather won a godfather too
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:00.120]  or at the same level.
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  They're both the same kind of movie.
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:02.120]  They're movies for adults.
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:03.120]  They're serious.
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.120]  They're, they're aiming for the same type of things.
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:07.120]  And the fact that godfather too
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  was just as good
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  and some people might say better.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  But they're still the same.
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:11.120]  But the Star Wars,
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  New Hope is like,
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  kind of more of a kid's movie.
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:15.120]  Again,
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  but the romance is not real romance.
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:18.120]  It's very simplified.
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  It's very sort of fairy tale.
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:22.120]  You know,
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  it aged right along with the kids.
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:25.120]  And Empire is like,
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  actually,
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:27.120]  we're going to take this even more seriously.
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  And not in a,
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:29.120]  everything is gritty.
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  You know,
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:31.120]  Tim Burton's Batman,
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:32.120]  or Dark Knight,
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  or Batman Begins,
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:34.120]  like everybody's got to be dark and gritty.
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  But just say,
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:36.120]  we're going to have real emotional stakes.
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:38.120]  We're going to have relationships between adults
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  that read as true to adults.
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  Right.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.120]  So it will,
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  and kids will pick up on the fact
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:45.120]  that the relationship between Han and Leia
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:48.120]  is a more legitimate adult relationship
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:51.120]  than anything that took place in New Hope.
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:52.120]  And that's why it stands out.
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:53.120]  It's like,
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:55.120]  it's taking it to the next level.
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  I love you.
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:57.120]  I love you.
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  I love you.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:25:59.120]  I love you observation.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:00.120]  I've probably been the incomparable,
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  in fact,
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:02.120]  I'm sure it was.
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:06.120]  The Han and Leia kiss on the Falcon
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:07.120]  and then they get interrupted.
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:09.120]  But when they end up in Cloud City,
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  and she's,
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:13.120]  they're in at the suite
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:14.120]  that they've been hooked up on,
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:17.120]  it's kind of,
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:19.120]  I never thought of it before,
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  but you had the observation
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.120]  that it's clearly just left together by that point.
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:23.120]  Because they're just,
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:24.120]  they're doing it together.
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.120]  Like there's so much more, like,
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:27.120]  relaxed around each other.
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  A release of tension.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  Yeah.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  Yeah.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:30.120]  Yeah.
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:31.120]  They're just like,
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  pretty chill with each other.
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:33.120]  Yeah.
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:34.120]  The way they relate to each other is that finally
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:35.120]  so much more intimate.
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:36.120]  And it was a will,
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  will they won't they?
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:38.120]  The answer was that they will,
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:39.120]  and they did.
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  And now they can relate to each other directly
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:42.120]  without,
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.120]  they're so guarded with each other before, kind of like,
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:45.120]  you know, they're,
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:46.120]  they're trying to guard themselves,
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  but not reveal too much of themselves,
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  but show that they want to get together,
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  and like,
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:51.120]  and eventually that settles down,
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:55.120]  and they can finally relate to each other directly
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:57.120]  without sort of the artifice of like,
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:58.120]  and it happens,
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.120]  it happens off camera,
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  and all you see is like that,
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:02.120]  just the familiarity,
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  and like the,
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:04.120]  he's,
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:05.120]  there's still teasing each other,
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:06.120]  but it's so much,
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:08.120]  there's less tension going on, you know?
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  Up until then,
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:10.120]  nothing that they've said to each other
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:12.120]  is actually what either one is actually feeling.
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:13.120]  Exactly.
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.120]  Right.
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  Except maybe,
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  the,
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:19.120]  oh,
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:20.120]  you do have your moment,
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  it's not many,
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:22.120]  but you do have them.
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:24.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.120]  And that was for the one of,
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  yeah.
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:28.120]  The fact they slept together
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:30.120]  where they believe both me and Dan Moran,
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  as it often happens,
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:34.120]  had the same thought at the same time in that podcast.
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:35.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:36.120]  But Hans hold take up until then,
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:38.120]  as I could take you would leave you,
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:39.120]  and which isn't true.
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:40.120]  He's obsessed.
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  And her angle is,
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  I'm not interested in you at all,
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  which is not true.
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  She's interested,
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:46.120]  even though she knows she shouldn't be.
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  Right.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:48.120]  Like,
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  if there's a line that,
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  that is honest,
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  it's her,
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  I like nice men.
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:53.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:54.120]  I'm nice, man.
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  I'm nice, man.
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:56.120]  But that brings,
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  it's so basic.
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:58.120]  That brings us to,
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:27:59.120]  to me,
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  what was the great thing about empire?
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  Was it,
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  it seemed as though George Lucas
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:06.120]  recognized his weaknesses
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:08.120]  and recognized everything that
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  could have been improved in the first one.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  And then,
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.120]  did they either took action to rectify it
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:16.120]  or,
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:17.120]  or delegated?
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:18.120]  So, for example,
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:20.120]  still tid character dialogue.
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  Guess what?
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:22.120]  George Lucas,
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  very creative at making stories,
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:24.120]  create a brilliant,
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:26.120]  a seriously brilliant world builder.
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:27.120]  Probably,
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  I would argue,
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  the most brilliant,
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.120]  cinematic world builder we've ever seen.
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:32.120]  Like,
[1:28:32.120 --> 1:28:34.120]  you can argue that the Lord of the Rings
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.120]  is a more fully realized world.
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  Yeah.
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:38.120]  Or something like that.
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.120]  But that's a novel.
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:40.120]  It's not cinema.
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:41.120]  You know,
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  as a purely cinematic world,
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  I would say he's unparalleled.
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:44.120]  Guess what?
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:45.120]  He can't write dialogue.
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.120]  What was the Harrison Ford line?
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:48.120]  George, you can't say,
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:49.120]  we can't write this for you can't say it.
[1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:50.120]  You can write this for you can't say it.
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:51.120]  Yeah.
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:52.120]  You can write this for you can't say it.
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:53.120]  So,
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:56.120]  he brings in two great screenwriters,
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:57.120]  Larry Cazden,
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:28:58.120]  who,
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.120]  I guess,
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:00.120]  yeah,
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:01.120]  did Raiders came first,
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:02.120]  did great work on Raiders,
[1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:04.120]  which is a fantastic story,
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:06.120]  and has fantastic dialogue
[1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:08.120]  and a fantastic relationship
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  between Harrison Ford and Marion.
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:12.120]  Yeah.
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  Well, Larry Cazden,
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:14.120]  and...
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  Right.
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:16.120]  Well,
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:17.120]  and talk about legend,
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:18.120]  the Lee Brackett,
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:21.120]  who wrote stuff for,
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:24.120]  like Humphrey Bogart,
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  and,
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:27.120]  you know,
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:28.120]  from that whole era,
[1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  from the 40s,
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:31.120]  those 40s film noir,
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.120]  which is great.
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:34.120]  And that's what,
[1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:35.120]  you know,
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.120]  I mean, obviously in 1981,
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:38.120]  when it came out,
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:40.120]  I had not seen the Maltese Falcon,
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.120]  you know,
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:43.120]  I thought black and white movies were for, you know,
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:44.120]  old people,
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:46.120]  but now that I have like a richer film vocabulary
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:48.120]  and I've seen movies like that,
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:50.120]  that's what the empire strikes back,
[1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:51.120]  crackles with the crackles.
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:53.120]  But they threw away most of that script, though,
[1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:54.120]  like,
[1:29:54.120 --> 1:29:56.120]  and the spirit of it still embodies it,
[1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:57.120]  like,
[1:29:57.120 --> 1:29:58.120]  but in the big empire,
[1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.120]  making a vampire book,
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:00.120]  by what,
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  risen or something like that,
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:02.120]  the big giant coffee table book
[1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:03.120]  about making a vampire,
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:04.120]  which is great,
[1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  everybody.
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:07.120]  Reading that made me feel like
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:09.120]  that Lucas picked these people
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:10.120]  who are amazingly talented,
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:11.120]  who had worked with these four,
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:12.120]  or knew,
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:13.120]  you know,
[1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:14.120]  like he picked people
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:15.120]  whose work he admired.
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:17.120]  And then when they said about doing things,
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:18.120]  either he was disengaged from it,
[1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:20.120]  or if he was engaged,
[1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:21.120]  feeling that I got from him
[1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  was like,
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:23.120]  guys,
[1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:24.120]  doesn't have to be that good.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:25.120]  Like that he would be fine with it.
[1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  It was like that they were,
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:28.120]  they wanted to make it the best it could possibly be.
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:29.120]  And if it up to him,
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:30.120]  he would be like,
[1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:31.120]  you guys don't need to just go home.
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:32.120]  Like,
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:33.120]  what you've got is fine.
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:34.120]  Yeah,
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.120]  that's fine.
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:36.120]  Whereas the people actually involved in making the movie
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:37.120]  were just like,
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:39.120]  we're going to make this as good as we can possibly make it.
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:41.120]  And they were arguing with each other
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:42.120]  about every little thing.
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:43.120]  Right down to the actors of Harrison Ford,
[1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:44.120]  arguing about Hans motivations,
[1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:46.120]  and what he would say in the scene of like,
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:47.120]  very collaborative,
[1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:48.120]  very contentious,
[1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:51.120]  aggressive filmmaking on the part of actually making the movie.
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:53.120]  And that Lucas would be like,
[1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:55.120]  it's just a kids movie,
[1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:56.120]  guys, just chill.
[1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:57.120]  Like you don't,
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:58.120]  it's not that like,
[1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:00.120]  if Lucas was more involved,
[1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:02.120]  he would not have been pressing people to.
[1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:04.120]  And we see what happens when he did have to say over everything
[1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:05.120]  again involved.
[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:06.120]  It's like,
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:07.120]  what he cared about deeply was like,
[1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:11.120]  the design of the ships and the computer graphics
[1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:12.120]  and stuff like that.
[1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:14.120]  And what he cared less about was like,
[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:15.120]  dialogue, story,
[1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:16.120]  acting performances,
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:17.120]  you know,
[1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:18.120]  all that type of stuff.
[1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:21.120]  So anyway,
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:23.120]  I'll take a time out for a sponsor break,
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:26.120]  but anybody who's looking for some good older movies to watch
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:28.120]  would could do worse than some of the ones
[1:31:28.120 --> 1:31:31.120]  that Lee Brackett worked on the screenplay for.
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:32.120]  Going backwards in time,
[1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:34.120]  I'm just looking at her IMDb credits.
[1:31:34.120 --> 1:31:37.120]  Some of the ones that I've seen that I'd know or stand out.
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:40.120]  The long goodbye from 1973,
[1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:44.120]  that was a Robert Altman movie,
[1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:47.120]  but to make a Philip Marlow detective story set
[1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:49.120]  in the 70s, starring,
[1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:52.120]  what's his name,
[1:31:52.120 --> 1:31:53.120]  the guy from,
[1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:54.120]  oh, Elliot Gould,
[1:31:54.120 --> 1:31:58.120]  from young kids on home for Motions 11.
[1:31:58.120 --> 1:32:02.120]  Like a 70s take on a 40s film noir,
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:04.120]  which was awesome.
[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:08.120]  Probably one of my favorite westerns ever made,
[1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:10.120]  Howard Hawk's Rio Bravo.
[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:11.120]  You guys ever see Rio Bravo?
[1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:12.120]  Yeah.
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:13.120]  Oh my God,
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:14.120]  it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:15.120]  Dean Allen,
[1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:16.120]  or not Dean Allen.
[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:19.120]  Dean Martin plays alcoholic.
[1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:20.120]  Sheriff.
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:21.120]  You don't say.
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:22.120]  Yes, him.
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:26.120]  But it's actually to me like a pretty interesting take
[1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:30.120]  on alcoholism in a kid's action movie,
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:32.120]  with John Wayne as his boss,
[1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:34.120]  great, great, great movie,
[1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:37.120]  and the big sleep from 1946
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:41.120]  with Humphrey Bogart and
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.120]  Lauren Bacall.
[1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:44.120]  Lauren, come on,
[1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:46.120]  that's probably the one.
[1:32:46.120 --> 1:32:47.120]  If you're only going to watch one of the ones
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:49.120]  I just watched the big sleep.
[1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:51.120]  And I know,
[1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:52.120]  you're right,
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:54.120]  they didn't use a lot of large parts of her script,
[1:32:54.120 --> 1:33:00.120]  they definitely infused the dialogue of Empire Strikes Back.
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:02.120]  All right, second sponsor.
[1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:05.120]  Let me thank our good friends at Fracture.
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:07.120]  Do you guys remember Fracture?
[1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:11.120]  They were sponsored to show a while back.
[1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:13.120]  Fracture is a service.
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:15.120]  You send your photos to them,
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:17.120]  and they print them directly on glass.
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:18.120]  Right?
[1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:20.120]  How many of our photos never even get printed?
[1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:23.120]  We never look at them anywhere except
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:27.120]  with a photo and your phone.
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:29.120]  You don't get to hang on your wall.
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:31.120]  You want to start printing some more photos out.
[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:32.120]  Go check out Fracture.
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:35.120]  They do this in an amazing way.
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:38.120]  With Fracture, you send them your photos.
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.120]  They print them directly on glass.
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:43.120]  It's not like a piece of paper behind glass.
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:44.120]  I don't know how they do it.
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:46.120]  I've never seen anything else like it.
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:48.120]  You send them your pictures.
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:50.120]  They print them directly on glass.
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  It's almost like the effect,
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.120]  something like with iPhones,
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:56.120]  where it used to look like you had a screen under the glass,
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:59.120]  and then when they started fusing the screen closer
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:02.120]  to the surface, it looks like the pixels are right on glass.
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:04.120]  That's what Fracture photos look like.
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:06.120]  They look like pictures printed directly on glass.
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  The prints come with a phone back
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:11.120]  that's ready to mount right out of the box.
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.120]  It's like a frame and you get desktop stand
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:16.120]  or something you can hang on the wall all in one
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  right out of the box, really clever packaging, frankly.
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:23.120]  And it just looks like no other picture
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:25.120]  that I've ever seen.
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:28.120]  It's a really cool gift just in time
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  for the holidays.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  Hey, there are the ones who booked this week,
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:34.120]  but it is.
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:35.120]  If you have future gifts to give out,
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:37.120]  birthdays and stuff like that,
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:39.120]  seriously, Fracture is great.
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:40.120]  We do it all the time.
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:42.120]  It is like the, it's just a go-to thing
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:44.120]  in my back pocket, like Mother's Day.
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:46.120]  Just find a picture in my kid.
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.120]  A couple of fractures for all the grandmothers
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  in the family and boom, there's a great gift.
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.120]  Here's where you go to find out more.
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:54.120]  Here's their website.
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:56.120]  Fracture me, all one word.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:58.120]  Fractureme.com
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:34:59.120]  and use this code.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.120]  It's just my last name, Gruber,
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:05.120]  GRU, B-E-R, and you can save 20%.
[1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:09.120]  They have a whole bunch of sizes ranging from really small,
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.120]  square ones, which are perfect for printing like
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:14.120]  Instagrams that you want to save and print out to.
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  It's enormously big.
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  All sorts of sizes, great, great quality.
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.120]  You won't regret it.
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:24.120]  Use the code Gruber and you'll save 20%.
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:25.120]  Yeah.
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:29.120]  I know our friend Marco uses Fracture for his,
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:32.120]  he makes Fracture set of his app icons.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  Hanks them on as well, which I think is a nice idea.
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  Yeah.
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:38.120]  That's only useful if you come out with a new app every year,
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:40.120]  like Marco and sell the old one.
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  But it's a cool idea.
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:42.120]  I like it.
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  Yeah, it is cool.
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.120]  I just want to say that, that they do that.
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:49.120]  Empire, we could go on and on about Empire,
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:52.120]  but it's, there's almost no wasted exposition.
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:55.120]  You're just, like you said, you're thrust back in this world.
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:57.120]  It feels like, yes, some stuff has gone on,
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  but the characters are on this exact same arc
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  that they were before.
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:02.120]  Yeah.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  I always use this word.
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:06.120]  And to me, it epitomizes the sense of camaraderie
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:09.120]  between the heroes of the original trilogy.
[1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:12.120]  It's this palpable sense of camaraderie,
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:16.120]  which I think is so hard to capture in movies.
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.120]  I feel like TV shows do a better job of it
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.120]  because can do a better job of it
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:22.120]  because they have so much more time.
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  Right.
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  If you watch Mad Men for six seasons,
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:28.120]  there's a camaraderie between Roger and Don
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:30.120]  because they've been through so much together
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:33.120]  because we've seen them through, you know,
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  I don't know, 140 hours of television.
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:41.120]  Whereas for Star Wars to have gotten to this palpable sense
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:43.120]  of camaraderie between these characters
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  that you truly believe after just, you know,
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  two hours and 15 minutes of film so far
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:53.120]  when Han says, you know,
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.120]  they say, you're never going to survive the night
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:56.120]  and he goes, well, then I'll see you and hell
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:36:57.120]  and he goes out.
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  You just believe it.
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  I believed it as a kid.
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:00.120]  It chokes me up.
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:02.120]  I get a lump in my throat when he does that,
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:04.120]  when I watch that because I feel to me
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  like it's not just serving the story.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:09.120]  That's what this guy would do.
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  Of course he's going.
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:13.120]  Of course he's like, what else is he going to do?
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:15.120]  And the way you build that camaraderie
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:18.120]  is you have to have the people beyond sample cast.
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:23.120]  You have to have them not sort of come together
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:24.120]  and just be friends from the beginning
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  and go, you need to have them be like at odds
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:30.120]  over certain things and have them,
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:31.120]  but heads about those things
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:33.120]  and come not so much resolve those things
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:35.120]  but come to an understanding about those things.
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:37.120]  Whatever things they disagree on,
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  I'm totally into the forest and that gets great.
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:41.120]  You think it's hokey.
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.120]  I'm with the rebellion.
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:44.120]  You're not so sure about it.
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:45.120]  I'm a hothead.
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:47.120]  I'm more calm.
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  Whatever personality traits that don't mesh,
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:53.120]  you have to show them clashing
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:55.120]  and then you have to show that they through
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:57.120]  the other things become more important.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  They come to an understanding about those differences
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:00.120]  and become friends.
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.120]  Then you also need to have them go through things
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:04.120]  like John said about Mad Men.
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:06.120]  You have to have them go through the moment
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:08.120]  they succeed in business failing business.
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:10.120]  One person is vulnerable because he's drunk
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:11.120]  and says something the other person
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:13.120]  who have one or two true moments between people
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:16.120]  and you could even have on a TV series
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  you could have a misunderstanding or betrayal
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  that eventually they figure out how to work out.
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  You have so much more time to have those things
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.120]  but in Star Wars with the Ensemble case
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:28.120]  and the first movie you throw these guys together
[1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  they don't know what to make of each other.
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:31.120]  They've probably never seen anybody like each other
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:33.120]  and there's other characters in the mix
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  and that Obi-Wan is there
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  and Han is just gonna do a job
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:40.120]  but it kind of feels for these people
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:42.120]  and the old guys weird and he dies
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:44.120]  and they're both there when the old guy dies.
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:45.120]  You have to have that.
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  I think the problem with a lot of Ensemble movies
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:49.120]  the more modern ones is you throw together
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:51.120]  this group of attractive, personable,
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:53.120]  well-adjusted, smart, witty people
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  and they just kind of walk parallel
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:57.120]  to each other side by side through the plot
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  and that does not build camaraderie.
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.120]  Yeah, like Han, it's very clear
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  because I just watched a new hope recently
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:05.120]  and it's very clear.
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:06.120]  Han, when he first meets them,
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  he just doesn't even believe him.
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:09.120]  He doesn't believe, he doesn't know
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:10.120]  what the hell kind of trouble they're in
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:14.120]  but his cynical self thinks whatever problem,
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:16.120]  whatever it is they want me to take him to Altarion
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:17.120]  for it's no big deal.
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  They're telling me it's the Empire.
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:21.120]  I trust me, I've seen trouble with the Empire.
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:22.120]  This is bullshit.
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:23.120]  Yeah, he doesn't believe him.
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:24.120]  Until the two Star Wars show up
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:25.120]  and he's like, whoa, okay.
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  I actually didn't expect this, you know?
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  In the cantina, all he's thinking about
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.120]  is ripping them off
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  and vastly overcharging them.
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:36.120]  As I pointed out on the, you know,
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:37.120]  a couple episodes about Empire.
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:40.120]  So Han is doing the thing where he's talking to them
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:42.120]  and negotiating the price and Luke is being
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:45.120]  not a good negotiator and Obi-Wan's trying to, you know,
[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:47.120]  tell him to calm down and work it out, right?
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:48.120]  They both leave the table.
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:50.120]  What you're left with at that point,
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  I think at that point you had seen Han,
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:53.120]  I forgot if you'd seen him with Greeter or not.
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  But anyway, you saw Han dealing with these guys
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:57.120]  as like, I've got a fast ship or whatever.
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:58.120]  As soon as they leave the table,
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  he talks to Chewie, person to person with this true self.
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:03.120]  These guys was really desperate.
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:04.120]  And at that point,
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:06.120]  when you see him talking to Chewie with this true self,
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:09.120]  you realize this guy's not such a hard ass, right?
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  He is, he clearly cares for Chewie.
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:13.120]  They have a real relationship with each other.
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.120]  He doesn't talk to Chewie like hired help.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.120]  He doesn't have a bluff, you have this bluster
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  and everything with Chewie.
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:19.120]  So you know that sort of like,
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  there's a heart of gold inside this gown drill.
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  So that's set up from the very beginning.
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  And that's how it works out.
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:27.120]  It's not like this guy is, you know,
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:30.120]  a hard ass and then suddenly he turns over and he leaves.
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:32.120]  The whole movie he has this conflict about.
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:34.120]  I have to show that I'm tough on the outside,
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  but on the inside, I'm a sensitive soul.
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:38.120]  There's a good idea.
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:39.120]  Go ahead, John.
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:41.120]  Well, just also the sense
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:44.120]  that he's in some financial trouble to some bad, you know,
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  some bad people.
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:46.120]  Yeah.
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:47.120]  And he's scared about it.
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:48.120]  Yeah.
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:49.120]  Guido comes almost immediately after this,
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:51.120]  after this, after the storm took your show up
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:54.120]  and then the next time we visit Han,
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:40:56.120]  Guido's there.
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:57.120]  There's a great idea.
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:40:59.120]  He does the indie thing in that scene
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:01.120]  where you don't have it with me.
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:02.120]  That's kind of the sake.
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:04.120]  Like Indiana Jones and Han saw a blend of a lot in my mind
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:06.120]  as a kid because there's a lot of crossover
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  in terms of Harrison Ford playing the kind of, you know,
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:12.120]  going to talk his way out of a jam type of thing.
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  Like he'll fight his way out of a jam
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  and he'll talk his way out of jam
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:16.120]  and he's able to do both and he'll switch between them
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:18.120]  based on the needs of the situation.
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:19.120]  So eventually he doesn't shoot Guido,
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.120]  but he tries to talk his way out of it first.
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:22.120]  And if that doesn't work,
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.120]  he's setting up his shooting the way out of it.
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  I'm getting my own self off point,
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:30.120]  but I think that's why it's okay that Han shoots first
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  is that he really did try to get out of that without any trouble.
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:36.120]  And only when it became like really clear
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:38.120]  that Guido was just going to shoot him.
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:39.120]  And as Paul Storm said,
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  that sets up his moral journey in like that he is slightly
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:44.120]  more amoral the beginning of the movie
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  because he's like, I just care about him.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  He's trying to put up a front that says,
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:50.120]  I'm tough, I only care about myself.
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  It's not true, but that's the front he's trying to put up.
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  See you later.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.120]  I don't care about your rebellion.
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:56.120]  He can't actually stick to that,
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:41:58.120]  but he's totally willing to shoot first
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  because that's what a tough guy,
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:00.120]  he's play acting,
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  the tough guy that he wishes for.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:03.120]  Yeah, he paints himself into a corner
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:04.120]  by being a tough guy,
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:05.120]  then it has to shoot the game.
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  So there shoots Guido, like Guido is scum
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:08.120]  and like Indy would, you know,
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:10.120]  Indy shoots the guy with the sword in the street.
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  Yeah, you don't feel like he is a little bit of a hard-ass
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:15.120]  because he has survived this long doing this job.
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:16.120]  Exactly.
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  There's just one scene in Empire
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  that I think really speaks to this aspect of Han,
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:25.120]  which is he's already saved Luke and Luke's been rehabilitated
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:26.120]  in that back-to-tank,
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:29.120]  and Luke is about to go out in the snow speeder
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:35.120]  to, you know, try to slow down the imperial assault.
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:39.120]  Meanwhile, Han is on top of the falcon trying to patch it back up.
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:42.120]  And Luke says goodbye to Chewie
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:44.120]  and Chewie gives him a big hug.
[1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:48.120]  And then there's just no words spoken between Han and Luke.
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:51.120]  They're just going to smile at each other and nod.
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:43:00.120]  And it's still, it's Luke kind of accepting Han's tough guy
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:02.120]  out of shell, like you can't say it,
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:04.120]  like they can't actually say anything,
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:07.120]  but there's just such a good connection between them then
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:08.120]  that I love it.
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:10.120]  I love that there was an intentional choice
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:12.120]  not to provide any dialogue there
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.120]  because I think anything you could have said
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:15.120]  would have just ruined it.
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.120]  Well, he stopped when he's walking away.
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  Luke was walking away.
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  It's like, well, I got my hug from Chewie
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  to walk away and then Han basically stops him by yelling,
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  but then after he's gotten his attention,
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:27.120]  that doesn't need to be a big, you know.
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:28.120]  Exactly.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  That's a macho.
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:30.120]  They're just nodding.
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:32.120]  But it's not even that macho.
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  I think there is a line there.
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:36.120]  It could be, but the line is not.
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:38.120]  The line is not what they would say.
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:40.120]  The line is not what George Lucas would write for them,
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:42.120]  which is take care out there because you are a good friend
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  and I like you.
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:44.120]  Yes.
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:46.120]  Yeah, it's something like take these or something.
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:47.120]  It's maybe good luck.
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  It's so minimal, but the way that they're communicating,
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:52.120]  it's not a tough guy thing.
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  It's more of like a good friend thing.
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:56.120]  Do you know what I mean?
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:58.120]  It's not like, yeah, like fist bump.
[1:43:58.120 --> 1:43:59.120]  It's not that.
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120]  Oh, it's the, it's carried.
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  It was like the reveal of like bringing down that wall
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:04.120]  ever so slightly.
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:05.120]  Exactly.
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:07.120]  Did they just like communicating without that wall
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  being in the way, but if people looking on the outside
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:11.120]  they don't think it's still a little bit of a macho thing
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.120]  because you can't show your emotions.
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:15.120]  Yes, I take that, but it's, yes.
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:17.120]  And it's an interesting contrast with Chewie,
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:21.120]  who is I think the actual toughest of the heroes
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:24.120]  and, you know, the one with the boar's temper
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:26.120]  and he's the one who just lets the hug fly.
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:29.120]  He's in touch with his emotions when the doors close.
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:32.120]  He whales because his friend is out there.
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.120]  He is much more if able,
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:35.120]  it's much more in touch with his emotions
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:38.120]  does not feel the need to tamp them down like much.
[1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  Right.
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:40.120]  Right.
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  He always lets his emotions.
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:46.120]  He always lets him find out.
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:49.120]  I was just going to say to me,
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  certainly all the way back to earlier in the show
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  when I said that I found Indy 4 more disappointing
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  than Phantom Menace.
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:58.120]  I agree with your assessment that the Phantom Menace
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  had more, the hope that it would be good
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  was bigger than the hope that Indy would be good.
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:05.120]  My thought, my line of thinking on that
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.120]  was simply though that Spielberg
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.120]  is still a very talented filmmaker
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:12.120]  and I thought that meant, you know,
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:14.120]  there was a good chance it could still be a good movie
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:16.120]  whereas by the time Phantom Menace came out
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:18.120]  because of the special editions,
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:21.120]  I was already so deeply pessimistic
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  because almost everything.
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:25.120]  I would say like nine out of every ten changes
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.120]  in the special editions was for the worse.
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:28.120]  Yeah.
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.120]  And I just made me think this man,
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:32.120]  George Lucas has lost his fucking mind
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:34.120]  and now he's going to make a whole movie
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  and to me everything that I thought
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.120]  would go wrong because of the special editions
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:41.120]  of the original trilogy was exactly
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:44.120]  what went wrong with the whole original trilogy.
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:46.120]  So I will say this about Empire Strikes Back.
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:49.120]  It is the only one that survived being special edition
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:52.120]  and I think came up better for it in many ways.
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  Yeah.
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:55.120]  I mean, I think the changes they made to Empire and Special Edition
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:56.120]  were pointless.
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  They did not need to be made,
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  but because Empire was so perfect.
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:00.120]  So perfect.
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:00.120]  Right.
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:02.120]  So part, like what can you do to it?
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  Like he had to fight to even find things
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  to put in like, well,
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:06.120]  well,
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  and then he was Cloud City, how does he get back to a Star Destroyer?
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:10.120]  We should see that.
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  That's stupid,
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:12.120]  but the running level of crappies.
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  That is stupid,
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  but the running round in the hallways of Cloud City
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  makes it look nicer because you can see it.
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:18.120]  I kind of like when it was all white,
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:20.120]  but that's what looks as a whole thing.
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  It's like, what could I not do
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:24.120]  because of budget or technology or time or both?
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:26.120]  Like, well, I couldn't have things through the windows.
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:27.120]  I had to paint them all white,
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:28.120]  so I'll put stuff in the windows.
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  I didn't like the stuff in the windows.
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:30.120]  I liked it being all white.
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:31.120]  When I was a kid,
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  I didn't feel like, hey, why are the walls opaque?
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  I felt like this is a weird futuristic looking set
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:36.120]  where it was white,
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  and when they changed it,
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:38.120]  it jumped out to me,
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:40.120]  but it didn't make it worse.
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:42.120]  It was the movie that didn't get worse
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  for being special.
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:44.120]  It didn't get a pretty big,
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  because who cares about that?
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:46.120]  It's minor point.
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  Oh, we get to see them fly into Cloud City.
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:49.120]  It doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie.
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  It sticks out.
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:51.120]  You don't need it,
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  but there was so little they had to do,
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:54.120]  like they weren't inserting
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:56.120]  entire new musical numbers, for example.
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:46:59.120]  They weren't altering major plot points,
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  like having Greedo shoot at Han.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:04.120]  They didn't load up 20 more ad ads
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:06.120]  in the Hoth battlefield.
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:07.120]  They were like,
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  oh, I wish I could have had more things going on
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:10.120]  in the Hoth battlefield.
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:12.120]  No, the amount of things in the Hoth battlefield
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  was appropriate.
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:14.120]  It was fine.
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:15.120]  You don't need to have all this
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:16.120]  put a bunch of things in the background too,
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:18.120]  and then we have a whole other section
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:19.120]  where we fly around.
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  It didn't need to be there.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  Yeah, they cleaned up the mat lines,
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  they added a few things here and there.
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:24.120]  They showed they didn't get mat lines.
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  They showed the mat lines.
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:26.120]  They showed the mat lines.
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:27.120]  They showed the mat lines.
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  They showed the mat lines.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  I don't know if you guys remember,
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:30.120]  but they redid the mat lines,
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:31.120]  but it wasn't called special edition,
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  but they did a cleaned up effects version of it.
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  I don't remember what release it was for.
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:36.120]  Maybe it was for like these.
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  They did go back
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:42.120]  and clean up a lot of the worst of the optical matting.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:46.120]  That's why I kind of had high hopes to special editions
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  because it was kind of like,
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:48.120]  oh, it's going to be more of that stuff.
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  It's going to be like things that were limitations of technology
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  at the time where the mat lines were super annoying
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:54.120]  or when it was something.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  Well, the other two just cleaned that.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  I don't know if you remember,
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  but in the snow speed,
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  it used to be able to see through the cockpit
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  into the,
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:00.120]  yeah,
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  slightly translucent.
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  And you always make that, if you can make it opaque now fine,
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:04.120]  because that's,
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:06.120]  you feel like that's not changing the movie.
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:08.120]  It's a special edition and it's like cleaned up,
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:10.120]  but it's not like in certain entirely new footage.
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  Yeah.
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:12.120]  And I remember,
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  and I believe it too,
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:16.120]  is I've read that with the mat lines on the spaceships,
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  like in the dog fighting in a new hope,
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:22.120]  when it was theatrically shown, originally,
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:24.120]  you might have been able to squint and see them,
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:26.120]  but just because of the nature between projecting
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:28.120]  versus the home video transfer,
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  they were nowhere near as noticeable.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  A lot of it was really just that it was the first home video transfer.
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  It was too light.
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  They blew out the blacks,
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  whereas everything looked,
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:39.120]  it was a lot richer black.
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:40.120]  It wasn't like,
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  wow,
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.120]  I don't remember seeing those lines around the tie fader fighters
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  when I was a kid.
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  Well, that's because you didn't really see them.
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:46.120]  Yeah, I'd buy that.
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  Yeah.
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:48.120]  But anyway,
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  that was my thing.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:50.120]  And to me,
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  nothing epitomizes it more than the Han shooting first.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:54.120]  And I know it's a cliche.
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:56.120]  I know that it's like a super popular t-shirt,
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  you know, Han shot first.
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:02.120]  But I feel like it's one of those things that it's a cliche
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  because it really does.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:06.120]  It's a way to just put your finger on everything that's wrong
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  with the special editions.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.120]  Because it seems to me,
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  and this is the way I put it,
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  it's almost as though like,
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  if George Lucas had sold Star Wars to Disney in 93
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  and then Disney did the exact same things,
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  you'd be like, oh my God,
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  this corporation doesn't know Jack should.
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:25.120]  It's like that they don't even understand Star Wars
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  and they're ruining this great thing.
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:30.120]  It's almost mind boggling that it was all done
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  by the guy who made it.
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  Well, I mean, it's not mind boggling.
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:35.120]  It makes sense to me because the guy who made it got older.
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  It's the same thing that happened with the Walkie Talk as an ET.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  It's like both people are like,
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  I'm very well known for this famous movie.
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  Now I'm an older person.
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:44.120]  And when I go back and look at the movie that I made
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:45.120]  when I was a younger man,
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:47.120]  I feel differently about it.
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:48.120]  And if I was making it today,
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:49.120]  I would make it differently.
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  And I feel it's too harsh for Han to shoot first
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  because Han is a sympathetic character
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:55.120]  and you start thinking of the children
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:57.120]  and I'm a father now or whatever.
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.120]  And the whole lesson from this is fine.
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:01.120]  Then make a different movie now.
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:05.120]  This is the movie you made when you were a young man.
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:07.120]  And this is the movie made by a young man.
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:09.120]  And when you go back and change that,
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:11.120]  that is the worst thing of the movie is like,
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  I know that you have changed.
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:13.120]  If you have changed,
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  make a new art that expresses where you are today.
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:19.120]  But the fact that his contemporary Spielberg did the same thing
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  with ET,
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:22.120]  oh, it's too upsetting that the people chasing after he
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.120]  have shotguns put a Walkie Talkie in there.
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:26.120]  How you feel now is a 50, 60 year old man.
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:27.120]  It's fine.
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:28.120]  But you can't go back and change the thing
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:29.120]  you made when you were a young man.
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.120]  Like, did he go back and change that back to guns?
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  Yeah, I mean, he was he was gilted into it
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  because he's also less stubborn than George.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:36.120]  Yeah.
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  He's thinking about it.
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:38.120]  But it's the same impulse
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:40.120]  because the people who made the movie's got older
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  and they still had the creative control to say,
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:43.120]  you know what?
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  I want to make a new version of this movie,
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  the better reflex who I am today.
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  And it's like, no, make a new movie
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:49.120]  for who you are today.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  That's the movie you made then
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:51.120]  when you were a different person.
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:53.120]  And it was a valid thing to be.
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  I agree with both of you.
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:55.120]  I think we're saying the same thing,
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  which is that, you know,
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:01.120]  you would have to write an entirely different scene
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:02.120]  to not have him shoot first
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:05.120]  because the thing if you've seen the film even once
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:07.120]  you can see that he tries to talk his way out of it.
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  He realizes he doesn't.
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:10.120]  And there is no way out for him
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:11.120]  other than to shoot Greedo.
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.120]  Greedo is going to kill him right there.
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:14.120]  Yeah, over my dead body.
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:15.120]  Yeah, that's the idea.
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:17.120]  I mean, and the thing is he's prepping,
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:18.120]  he's a KG person.
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:20.120]  He's prepping for that the whole time.
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:21.120]  He's like, he's not going to say,
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:23.120]  oh, after I fail to talk myself out of it,
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  then think of a plan B.
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:25.120]  Plan B is already ready.
[1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:26.120]  Plan B has to already be ready
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:28.120]  because that's how he lives this long in his business.
[1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  It feels like a change that was mandated
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:32.120]  by like Disney corporate, you know,
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:35.120]  like we can't have a hero shoot first.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:36.120]  This is a corporate test.
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:38.120]  Disney corporate barely can be bothered
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:40.120]  to take out the blackface in their old movie.
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:42.120]  So I would have just left the shooting first.
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:43.120]  That's fine.
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:44.120]  Well, I'm just gonna get upset about it.
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:45.120]  I'm just saying though,
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:48.120]  it feels like somebody outside the film
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:49.120]  who hadn't even seen it
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:52.120]  is just holding up a checklist that says
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:53.120]  the heroes can't do this.
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:54.120]  It feels like,
[1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:55.120]  it feels like somebody from like,
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  what is that thing?
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:58.120]  The something parents association
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:51:59.120]  people always write to the FCC
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:00.120]  to complete purchasing and stuff.
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:03.120]  It's like sort of like an old person
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:05.120]  who's like, oh, kids these days
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:07.120]  and they're cursing and baggy pants
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:09.120]  and we really need to quitting this up.
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:12.120]  And like it's that type of idea
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:14.120]  that older people who are uncomfortable
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  with things that younger people think are cool.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:20.120]  Like because, you know, it's just too harsh.
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:22.120]  That character feels like Han Solo
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:24.120]  is a lovable, likable, good character
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  and he would never do something that bad.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:27.120]  Whereas a younger filmmaker
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  or anyone who has more artistic integrity
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:30.120]  is good people do bad things.
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  People grow.
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  The same reason that he grew,
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:34.120]  he should have been able to say,
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  this is what Han was like when he was younger
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:37.120]  and less wise.
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:39.120]  And when I made the movie,
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:40.120]  that's the character I made
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:42.120]  and now Han is older and more wise and kinder
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  and he has changed
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:44.120]  but you can't retroactively go back
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:45.120]  and make yourself,
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  it's like retro actually going back
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  in your own life and making yourself
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:49.120]  not too stupid things when you're a teenager.
[1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  That's part of who you are.
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:55.120]  We haven't spoken much about Return of the Jedi yet.
[1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:57.120]  Just the opening where Luke, you know,
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.120]  it's sort of vaguely touching the line
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:03.120]  on maybe what a Jedi would do
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:06.120]  in terms of the dark side.
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:07.120]  So that movie,
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  I think the more I watch it
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:10.120]  as I get older,
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  the more I like it.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:12.120]  Really?
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  Yeah, I don't love it
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:14.120]  and it's nowhere near,
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:15.120]  it doesn't make me anywhere near
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:18.120]  and near as happy as Star Wars or Empire does.
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:19.120]  But I almost feel like,
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:20.120]  I don't know how else
[1:53:20.120 --> 1:53:22.120]  he has to close the trilogy.
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:23.120]  Yeah, okay, well.
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:26.120]  So I put it above Star Wars for me
[1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:27.120]  just because I really like it.
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  It is a more,
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  it's like,
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:32.120]  so Empire took it up to the next level.
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:34.120]  Say here's a movie that's appreciated for all ages.
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:37.120]  It has sophisticated story, emotion,
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:38.120]  things for adults in it
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:39.120]  and also kids of 11.
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:41.120]  So that brought it up to the adult level.
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:43.120]  Jedi brought things back down a little bit
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  with the UOC business
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  and I feel like the culmination of the arc.
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:47.120]  How this story ends,
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  I'm at the whole angle of like,
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:50.120]  Luke doing something that movie heroes
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:51.120]  never do,
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  which is, you know,
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  pacifism is the victory.
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.120]  Like that never haven't.
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:56.120]  Pacifists are wimps.
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:57.120]  Nobody wants a pacifist.
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:54:00.120]  You want John McLean to shoot the guy.
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:02.120]  You want the cop who was guilty about shooting.
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  And drop him off the roof.
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.120]  Drop him off the roof.
[1:54:05.120 --> 1:54:06.120]  Right.
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:07.120]  And you want the cop who felt bad
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:08.120]  or couldn't pick up his gun again
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  because he accidentally shot that kid
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  to get his gun back and say,
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  now I'm confident that I can shoot people again.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  Pacifism never wins.
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:17.120]  Can you think of it any other movie anywhere
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  where pacifism leads to regret it?
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:20.120]  Again, it's a kind of a jump
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  because the Vader Vader does a thing.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  Maybe Gandhi,
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:24.120]  like, you know,
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  you've got a big,
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:26.120]  you've got a big,
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  the that is the struggle at the end.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  It is a sophisticated struggle
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  in emotional struggle
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:35.120]  between Luke not giving into his anger
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  and fighting Vader
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  and the moment when Luke is winning the fight
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  which is what you want the good guy to do
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  for the kids who are rooting for the guy.
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:44.120]  Beat the bad guy.
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  Good guy, beat the bad guy.
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  Good guy, maybe down for the count.
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  Good guy, maybe on the ropes
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  but he's going to come back
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  and he's strong and he's going to beat the bad guy.
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  That's the,
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  when that's happening in Jedi,
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  that's the bad guy.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  You're like, no, Luke,
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  don't do that.
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Bring little kids along
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.120]  and that journey
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  because all little kids want
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  is the good guy to beat the bad guy.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  To bring little kids along to the point
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  where they are sad
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  when the good guy is beating the bad guy.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:06.120]  I think it's a nice message.
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  I think it's a message
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  that is never, ever seen
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.120]  and I think the sophistication
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  of that culmination,
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  I do belong to that star again,
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  but the sophistication
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:14.120]  of the resolution
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  of the Luke Vader story
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  elevates the rest of that movie,
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  silly, you walks and all.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  Okay, so I totally agree with you
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:23.120]  in terms of Luke's arc
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  and yes,
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  that is the most satisfying thing
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  and it's ultimately
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  every team's Vader and Luke
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  and the space battle is good too.
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:32.120]  Oh, yeah.
[1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  Oh, my God.
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:34.120]  They don't make space battle.
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:35.120]  They don't make space battle.
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  People you care about,
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:37.120]  it's not just a bunch of,
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  yeah, it's not just a bunch of ships flying around.
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  You care about Lando by that point
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:41.120]  because you know him.
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  You care that he's flying
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  someone else's ship, right?
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  Yeah.
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:45.120]  You care like the three fronts thing,
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  people down on the planet,
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  people in the space station,
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  Luke and the Death Star.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  The coordination between those three lines of action
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:53.120]  is I think very well done.
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  I totally agree.
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  It's attempted to do
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  in many other movies.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  I think, you know,
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:58.120]  in a modern device,
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  it's like, oh, we see that all the time,
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:00.120]  the multiple lines of action,
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  culminating around the one thing,
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  but this was an early occurrence
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:04.120]  and I think the balance
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  between those three plot lines
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  is just very nice.
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  So sometimes when they're under
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:09.120]  you walk planet,
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  but at least it's all connected in a way
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  that you understand
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  and in a way that it should be.
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  But what I don't like about it is,
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  sorry, John,
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:17.120]  I think I cut you off,
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  but just,
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  well, I'm just going to say that it makes sense,
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  not scientifically,
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:22.120]  not like if you really try to think it through,
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  but if you just go with the flow
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:25.120]  of Star Wars level logic,
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:27.120]  it makes sense that all three things
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  are simultaneous.
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  Yeah.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  I mean, just as a narrative.
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  And then they're relying on each other,
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:34.120]  like this cast that we've come to know
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:36.120]  and they've been with each other
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  they're ensemble cast,
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  they're friends.
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  They are spread out
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  to be different missions
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:42.120]  for this final battle here
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  and they're all relying in trouble.
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  If Han doesn't get that shield down,
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  they can't do the attack.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:48.120]  And if Luke doesn't defeat the Emperor
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:49.120]  inside there,
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  it doesn't matter because,
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  you know, if he gets turned,
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  then they can blow up the Star
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  but then they have a problem
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  many ways that the Emperor will survive.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:57.120]  The only person who kills the Emperor is Vader.
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  So all,
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  they're all depending on each other
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  and they're all leverage of each other
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  like the Emperor saying,
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  oh, your friends out there,
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  you think we know about their plan,
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  their screwed,
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  like it all connects nicely.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  So I completely agree with you
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  that I guess the last third
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:14.120]  or at least the second half of that movie is great.
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  We've got Akbar.
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:16.120]  He's amazing.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:18.120]  The ship battles great.
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  The surprise appearance of the,
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  like the bulk of the Imperial Fleet.
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  Amazing.
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  The shield being up
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  and all of those ships having to dodge.
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  Amazing.
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:28.120]  Everything's great.
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:29.120]  I love it.
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.120]  And you're totally right about everything coming together.
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  Jedi, for me,
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  starts out with
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  the world's most
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  insane,
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  higgly-piggly plan of like,
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  what the hell are you doing?
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  So you give,
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:43.120]  you give the droids
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.120]  to Jabba
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:46.120]  and you've got Lando embedded
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:48.120]  and
[1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:50.120]  then you hand over,
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  but then wait,
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:53.120]  then you hand over a Chewbacca
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  and then you try to get
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:58.120]  hand solely released,
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  but Chewbacca's already in the thing
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  and then when it comes down to it,
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  you thought you were going to get dragged over
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:06.120]  or start like pit,
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:07.120]  so that
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:08.120]  R2DZ would be serving drinks
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:10.120]  and jettison at, like,
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  a light saber to you.
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:12.120]  So you can just
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  not have it made sense.
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  It is the stupidest plan in there.
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:16.120]  They had no,
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  they're outgun, right?
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  Because the people are going after Han,
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:20.120]  it's not the entire rebellion.
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  The entire rebellion is not coming
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:22.120]  down to Adam.
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  No, no, no.
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:24.120]  It's just this plan, right?
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:25.120]  And so they,
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:26.120]  a frontal assault is not going to work.
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  Sure.
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:28.120]  So they seem to have
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  planned A, B, C and D.
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  So they have a lot of things going on here.
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:32.120]  They have people embedded there.
[1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  They have the droids.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:34.120]  Luke goes there.
[1:58:34.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  Like he's planned,
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:36.120]  he's probably,
[1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  his primary plan is probably,
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:38.120]  you know,
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:40.120]  maybe we can get him out with these guys
[1:58:40.120 --> 1:58:42.120]  who are embedded if they can't send in Luke,
[1:58:42.120 --> 1:58:43.120]  but don't send in Luke with his lightsaber
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:44.120]  because Luke gets screwed.
[1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:45.120]  We need to have his lightsaber available.
[1:58:45.120 --> 1:58:47.120]  So smuggle that into R2, right?
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:49.120]  It's a lot of contingency plans
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:51.120]  and basically all their contingencies
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  needed to be there
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:53.120]  because everything goes wrong
[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  and they're at the brink of death.
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:57.120]  And their final contingency
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:58:58.120]  was,
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  Luke can get out of this as long as
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:00.120]  yes, his lightsaber.
[1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:01.120]  We do have his lightsaber like,
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  I don't see them as contingencies.
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:04.120]  Yeah.
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:05.120]  So much is like,
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:06.120]  we're going to set up a bunch of things
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:07.120]  that may be useful
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:09.120]  and maybe it'll all work out.
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:11.120]  But that's a good opening scene.
[1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  It's like a good bond opening scene.
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:13.120]  It's like,
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:14.120]  yeah, that's exactly interesting.
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  It's still like it goes on a lot longer
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:17.120]  than bond opening scene.
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:18.120]  It is a little bit contrived,
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:19.120]  but you get to see,
[1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:20.120]  first of all,
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:21.120]  you've got to resolve the Han angle
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:22.120]  and get that out of the way for the movie.
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  And second of all,
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:26.120]  it's like a series of fun action set pieces.
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:27.120]  It's like,
[1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:28.120]  you know,
[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:29.120]  three bond monsters,
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:30.120]  you've got the rank core,
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:31.120]  the satellite pit,
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:33.120]  and then you've got a lot of like intrigue
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:34.120]  with people in this game.
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:35.120]  Bob and Phil.
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  Sadly, sorry,
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  Jenna,
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:37.120]  keep cutting off.
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:38.120]  Well,
[1:59:38.120 --> 1:59:39.120]  the only Star Wars movie
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:41.120]  that doesn't have any scenes on Tatooine.
[1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:42.120]  Empire.
[1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:43.120]  Right.
[1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:46.120]  And here they are back on Tatooine
[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:48.120]  and instead of feeling at that time
[1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:49.120]  because at that point,
[1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:51.120]  50% of all Star Wars movies
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:52.120]  had scenes on Tatooine,
[1:59:52.120 --> 1:59:53.120]  just, you know, half,
[1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:54.120]  just the one.
[1:59:54.120 --> 1:59:55.120]  Here it is.
[1:59:55.120 --> 1:59:56.120]  It felt like a,
[1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:57.120]  you know,
[1:59:57.120 --> 1:59:58.120]  he started on Tatooine.
[1:59:58.120 --> 1:59:59.120]  He didn't know shit about the force.
[1:59:59.120 --> 2:00:01.120]  Now he's back on Tatooine
[2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:02.120]  and he's a Jedi.
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.120]  And it felt like a closing another loop.
[2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:06.120]  You're not just closing the loop on Han,
[2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:08.120]  being kidnapped and frozen in carbonite.
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:11.120]  You're closing the loop on Luke's,
[2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  you know, childhood.
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:15.120]  And that sets up the rest of the arc
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:16.120]  of the movie though
[2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:17.120]  because he,
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:18.120]  you saw him at the end of Empire
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:19.120]  and he is defeated.
[2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:20.120]  His hand is cut off.
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:21.120]  He's a mess emotionally.
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:22.120]  He just found out
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:23.120]  very his father,
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:24.120]  he is at his low.
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:25.120]  You see him in Jedi.
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:26.120]  You're like,
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  who is this guy?
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:28.120]  Last time I saw him,
[2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:29.120]  he was drenched in sweat
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:30.120]  with his hand cut off and like,
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:31.120]  I'm like crap.
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:32.120]  Now this guy is confidently
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:33.120]  strolling into here.
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:34.120]  I'm strangling people.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:35.120]  I'm strangling people.
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:36.120]  Yeah, but he's strangling people.
[2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:37.120]  That's,
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  that's a bit sad.
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  And he's like super powerful.
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:40.120]  Like wow,
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:41.120]  Luke is super powerful.
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  I guess his arc is done
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:43.120]  and you find out his arc
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  is not done
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:45.120]  because what he's got to deal with now is,
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  oh,
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:47.120]  so you think you're the master of the force,
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  everything.
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  You don't even know what the actual battle
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  is against your nature
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  of not using your newfound powers
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  for evil.
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:54.120]  And that is the actual battle.
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:55.120]  And that's what he goes back to you.
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:56.120]  And he's like,
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  you're a Jedi, no, you have to face Vader.
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:00:59.120]  Why does he have to face Vader?
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  It's not like some trial.
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  Like, oh,
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  the understanding of these
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  is a kid is like,
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  you have to face Vader
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  because when you beat him
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:06.120]  that shows you're the best guy
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  because this is the guy.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  No, you have to face Vader
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  because you have to deal with
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  the whole dark side angle.
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  Like, do you remember your failure in the cave?
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  You have to face Vader to show
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:14.120]  that you really do
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:15.120]  and that you really are
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:16.120]  on the white side of the force
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  and not the dark side of the only way
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:18.120]  to do that is to test yourself
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:19.120]  against someone that you totally
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  want to kill
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:21.120]  and not do it.
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:22.120]  Right.
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  I agree with you, Guy,
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  that it logically
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  probably should have just gone in
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:28.120]  with the lights.
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  Right.
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:30.120]  Yeah.
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  You know, that the whole idea
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:32.120]  that instead of going in with the lightsaber,
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:34.120]  I'll smuggle it in R2
[2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  and I'll just assume
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  that if and when I really need it,
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:38.120]  he'll be in shooting him.
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  But he can't go in with the lightsaber
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:40.120]  because if he's got to kill
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  every man, woman, and child
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:42.120]  and job is passed
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  because it's not like he's going
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:44.120]  to race out of there
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  with a gigantic car ride.
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  But he grabs somebody's gun
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  and tries to blast jab in the face.
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  Oh, that is not Jedi stuff.
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:52.120]  That is not Jedi stuff.
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  He's improvising at that point
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  and he's trying to shoot
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  an unknown guy in the face.
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:58.120]  That is not.
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  He's trying to negotiate his way
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  out of the thing
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  and they're like, oh, actually
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:02.120]  we're going to send you into the pit
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  and you try to see the force
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:04.120]  to get out of it.
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:06.120]  Things don't go well for him.
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  Isn't that the first time
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  in the movies?
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  Because we, you know,
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  the whole original trilogy
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  is relatively light on
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  Jedi action.
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:16.120]  You know, it's the first time
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  we've seen the Jedi mind trick
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  not work on somebody.
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:20.120]  Yeah.
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  And that's where we learn
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:22.120]  that it only works
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:24.120]  on the weak-minded force.
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  Well, no, actually,
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:26.120]  I think Kenobi says
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  that the force
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:28.120]  can have a powerful influence
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  on the weak-minded side.
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:30.120]  Yeah, I mean,
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  the original trilogy
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  is really good at paying off things.
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  In ways that movies
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:36.120]  are not patient about now.
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  Movies today
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:38.120]  have something in the beginning
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  of the movie
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  and they're going to pay it off
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:40.120]  by the end of the movie.
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  Very rarely do you have
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:42.120]  something in one movie
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  and pay off on a second movie
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  and the Star Wars trilogy
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:46.120]  has think tons of things
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  in the first movie
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:48.120]  that do not get paid off
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  until two movies later,
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:50.120]  which nobody has
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  got to do anymore,
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:52.120]  because there may be
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  like the big Marvel arcs
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:54.120]  now that they have.
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  But even that is like
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  you're much more assured
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  like they set up so much stuff
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:58.120]  in a new hope.
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  The job of the HUD himself
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:00.120]  was set up in a new hope
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  would have been in the movie
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  they had the time or budget
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  they didn't put them
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  in the second movie.
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  He's in the third movie.
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:06.120]  Right.
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  Yeah, pay off the debt
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  that we've heard
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  when we first seen
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  we meet Han Solo 40 minutes
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:12.120]  in the new hope.
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  We don't pay it off
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:14.120]  until the third movie.
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  But he needs to do
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  an empire, right?
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  I've got to assume
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  that the guy
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  I know would my devil
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  sent by Jabba.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  Yeah.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:20.120]  Yeah, that's a death.
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  What did you say?
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:22.120]  The general says
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  like a death sentence.
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:24.120]  Yeah, but I don't know
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  they mentioned.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  That's not an easy thing
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:26.120]  to live with.
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  Yeah, they don't
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  mention Jabba by name
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:28.120]  but it's clearly.
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:30.120]  And I think Luke's idea
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  that hey, I'll try
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:32.120]  the Jedi mind trick on it.
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  Maybe this would be easy.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  That would not have been
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  dissatisfied
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  if Jabba was like,
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:38.120]  okay.
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  You have to end up
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:40.120]  puncturing Luke's confidence
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  because he comes in
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:42.120]  as a star-coated figure
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  who could this be
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:44.120]  and like he works
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  any super confident
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  you will give Han Solo
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  to me and like gradually
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:48.120]  things fall apart
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  he gets confident.
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:50.120]  That is like how we do it
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  and you know, same as usual
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:52.120]  that bad, huh?
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:53.120]  Like that point
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  like his confidence
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:56.120]  in Buster has been
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  pierced and he's back
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:03:58.120]  to the old Michael
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  Luke that who's like,
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:00.120]  well, he's more powerful now
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  but things really aren't
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:02.120]  going well anyway.
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  Because he does get
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:04.120]  past the butt loop
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  with the Jedi mind trick
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:06.120]  right?
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  And that's what sets
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:08.120]  out Jabba
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  to be like, oh, you fool
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  you idiot.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  Yeah.
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:12.120]  I got to get
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  a better help.
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:14.120]  Yeah.
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  His twisty-headed
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:16.120]  constantly air.
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  Yeah, I'm sure
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:18.120]  people are yelling at us
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:20.120]  right now, but whatever.
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  My only problem
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  with the opening scene
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:23.120]  which I agree
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:24.120]  paste-wise
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  even more than the battle
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:26.120]  at Hoth, which is almost
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  more of like an opening act
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  because it involves
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:30.120]  everything from Luke, you know,
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:31.120]  getting captured
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  by the Wampa
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  and Han rescuing him
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:34.120]  to the whole battle.
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  To me that the
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  the Jabba scene
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:38.120]  paste-wise
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  feels like a bond
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:40.120]  opening thing.
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  Yeah.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  My only problem
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  with that whole bit
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:44.120]  is the ignominious way
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  that Boba Fett
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  Yeah.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.120]  That's not good.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  It's not,
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:50.120]  it's not talk about it.
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:51.120]  It's a sign of things to come.
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  Yeah.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  I don't know how
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  you can do that.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  I think we do give him
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  a will helm, which is a little
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  nod of respect
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:04:59.120]  but other than that.
[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:00.120]  Well, yeah.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  I don't, I just don't
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:03.120]  understand.
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  You know,
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:05.120]  they knew
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:06.120]  what they knew
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:07.120]  like it was.
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:08.120]  They knew how cool
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:09.120]  there's a lot more
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:10.120]  slapstick in Jabba.
[2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:11.120]  There's a lot more humor
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:12.120]  and slapstick stuff
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:13.120]  which I think
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:14.120]  for the most part works,
[2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:15.120]  but the fact
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:16.120]  that it's wrapped up
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:17.120]  in a slapstick joke
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:18.120]  and that ends up being
[2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:19.120]  his death is a shame.
[2:05:19.120 --> 2:05:20.120]  He's the only guy
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:21.120]  that can go toe to toe
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:22.120]  with the Jedi.
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:23.120]  And he looks
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:24.120]  like he's going to win
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:25.120]  like it.
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:25.120]  Yeah.
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:26.120]  And normally he's
[2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  crafty and waiting
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:28.120]  for his moment,
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:29.120]  like he's established
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:30.120]  as not the toughest
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:31.120]  bounty hunter
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:32.120]  but the smartest
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:33.120]  the streets.
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:34.120]  Exactly.
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:34.120]  That's an empire
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:35.120]  that establishes his character.
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:36.120]  And he doesn't
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:36.120]  even get taken
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:37.120]  out by purpose.
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:38.120]  He gets taken
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:39.120]  out by
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:41.120]  like a blind hand solo.
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:42.120]  He should not
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  he either should
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:44.120]  not have been there
[2:05:44.120 --> 2:05:44.120]  at all
[2:05:44.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  just leave, you know,
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:46.120]  he's not there
[2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:47.120]  or he should have gotten away.
[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:48.120]  Well, I mean,
[2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:49.120]  I'm okay with
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.120]  Luke cutting his gun in half
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:51.120]  because like,
[2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:51.120]  well, you're up
[2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:52.120]  against a Jedi.
[2:05:52.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  That can happen.
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:54.120]  I'm not okay with
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  the way he died.
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:56.120]  Yeah.
[2:05:56.120 --> 2:05:57.120]  That's garbage.
[2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:58.120]  But they made him
[2:05:58.120 --> 2:05:59.120]  even worse
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:05:59.120]  by having him
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:00.120]  like basically
[2:06:00.120 --> 2:06:01.120]  be all into that
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:02.120]  musical scene
[2:06:02.120 --> 2:06:02.120]  that they added.
[2:06:02.120 --> 2:06:03.120]  Like they just
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:03.120]  keep making
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:04.120]  bump of it
[2:06:04.120 --> 2:06:05.120]  one more sad.
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:05.120]  Well, they did
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:06.120]  in the original run
[2:06:06.120 --> 2:06:07.120]  he just gives
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:08.120]  the little nod
[2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:09.120]  to the sexy girl
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:09.120]  dancer
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:10.120]  which is totally
[2:06:10.120 --> 2:06:11.120]  a piece of thing
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:12.120]  you can see.
[2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:13.120]  Of course.
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:14.120]  But, yeah.
[2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:15.120]  You know,
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:16.120]  and let's not even
[2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:17.120]  get into
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:17.120]  jango fit
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:18.120]  in the hole.
[2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:19.120]  God.
[2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:20.120]  What a waste
[2:06:20.120 --> 2:06:22.120]  of a character.
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:23.120]  Well, you know,
[2:06:23.120 --> 2:06:24.120]  and the only
[2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:25.120]  other thing
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:25.120]  I'll say
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:26.120]  about Return
[2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  of the Jedi is
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  to me,
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:28.120]  the weak spot
[2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:29.120]  is the whole
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:30.120]  thing
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:31.120]  on the
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:31.120]  end
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:32.120]  or moon
[2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:33.120]  that third moon
[2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:34.120]  of end
[2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:34.120]  Oh, like the
[2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:35.120]  whole
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:36.120]  the middle
[2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:36.120]  bit
[2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:36.120]  with the
[2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:37.120]  e-woks
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:38.120]  Yeah,
[2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:38.120]  it just doesn't
[2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:39.120]  live up
[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:39.120]  and it's
[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:40.120]  partly
[2:06:40.120 --> 2:06:41.120]  just that
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:41.120]  the whole
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  e-walk thing
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  was
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:43.120]  because it was
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:43.120]  like
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:44.120]  have you guys heard
[2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:44.120]  this
[2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:45.120]  there's
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:45.120]  I don't
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  know, you know,
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  you know,
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  you know,
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  how much
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:47.120]  this is a
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:47.120]  pocketful
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:48.120]  and how much is true
[2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:49.120]  but that the toys
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:49.120]  that
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:50.120]  already
[2:06:50.120 --> 2:06:50.120]  been put
[2:06:50.120 --> 2:06:51.120]  into production
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:51.120]  before they
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:52.120]  made the
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:52.120]  costumes
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:53.120]  and the
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:53.120]  costumes
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:54.120]  were like
[2:06:54.120 --> 2:06:55.120]  just incredibly hot
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:56.120]  and just
[2:06:56.120 --> 2:06:57.120]  and it
[2:06:57.120 --> 2:06:58.120]  really limited
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:06:58.120]  the actors
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:06:59.120]  ability
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  to move
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  that's why
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  they
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:01.120]  just sort
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:01.120]  of
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:02.120]  waddle
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:03.120]  instead
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:03.120]  of
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:04.120]  walk
[2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:04.120]  I hadn't heard
[2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:05.120]  that
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:05.120]  I had
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:06.120]  heard
[2:07:06.120 --> 2:07:07.120]  that
[2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:08.120]  eventually
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:08.120]  it was
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:08.120]  going
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:09.120]  to be
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:09.120]  the
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:10.120]  working
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:10.120]  planet
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:10.120]  because
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:11.120]  sheet
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:11.120]  yeah,
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:11.120]  yeah,
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:11.120]  yeah,
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:12.120]  yeah,
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:12.120]  but
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:12.120]  your work
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:13.120]  is
[2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:14.120]  taking on
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:15.120]  a strong
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:15.120]  troopers
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:16.120]  you can
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:16.120]  believe that
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:17.120]  right
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:18.120]  and there's
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:18.120]  just a
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:19.120]  silliness
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:20.120]  to it
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:19.120]  that these little
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:20.120]  furry
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:21.120]  you know,
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:21.120]  two
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:22.120]  fit
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:22.120]  tall
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:23.120]  creatures
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:23.120]  are
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:24.120]  beating
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:24.120]  storm
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:25.120]  troopers
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:25.120]  literally
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:25.120]  I
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:26.120]  do
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:26.120]  like
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:27.120]  I
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:27.120]  do
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:28.120]  like
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:28.120]  I
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:29.120]  do
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  like
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  I
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:31.120]  do
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:32.120]  like
[2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:33.120]  I
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:34.120]  do
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:35.120]  like
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:35.120]  I
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:36.120]  do
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:37.120]  like
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:38.120]  mostly
[2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:39.120]  made
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  for kids
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  and
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  I
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  don't
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.120]  help
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:42.120]  the
[2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:43.120]  way
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:43.120]  maybe
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:44.120]  I
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:45.120]  just
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.120]  appreciate
[2:07:46.120 --> 2:07:49.120]  that
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:51.120]  or
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:51.120]  the
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:53.120]  this
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:08:00.120]  as
[2:08:00.120 --> 2:08:01.120]  it that
[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:02.120]  kind
[2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:03.120]  of
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:04.120]  well
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:05.120]  I
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:06.120]  feel
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:09.120]  like
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:17.680]  Han and Leia who we wanted to see more of and what they just they so we got these scenes with them
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:24.400]  you know having this act assault on the the the the shield generator whereas the real what really matter
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:30.400]  what was left to really matter in the story was the other two angles which was the big space battle with
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:37.280]  the fleet the two fleets fighting each other and you know and then primarily the Luke Vader Emperor yeah I mean
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:43.520]  so the whole end or thing in addition to being silly just because they're little ewoks it it really
[2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:47.280]  felt a little forced because it's like well we just want more Han and Leia and we're never
[2:08:47.280 --> 2:08:51.280]  well I mean but that was the gorilla action supporting the larger thing it's like you got
[2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:54.480]  to deactivate the shield generator which is in a remote place you're going to send a small
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:57.760]  strike team because this is your stealth mission that's why Luke doesn't go on and he's
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:00.800]  endangering the mission he shouldn't have come because they could send sim and all stuff you
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:05.280]  could have a speeder chase to the redwoods that's also that's actually seen there oh it's
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.960]  spilling yeah well it fits a lot better than like the pod racing scene which is just this whole
[2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:17.200]  giant digression whereas the the the the speeder bikes and the moon was just a really cool
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:21.680]  action and the speeder bike is like you know the whole idea is that stealth and so it's jam
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:25.920]  their common like with the little script he used to say we want to have a chase scene and the
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:28.880]  stakes of the chase scene are as if you let these guys escape they're going to tell the whole
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:31.440]  empire that you're down here never mind the emperor already knows you're down here at that point
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.120]  the audience doesn't know that but there's a reason for the chase scene is a reason for the
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:38.960]  desperation that's basically hide and seek we don't want the empire to know we're down here some
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:41.840]  people start getting that's the whole thing you think you got them all then you see two other
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:44.880]  guys get off and speeder bikes then you got to jump on a speeder bike and make sure they don't
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:50.160]  get out of here so one thing that used to bother me is a kid and only recently have I come around
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:54.000]  to the thought that maybe Lucas actually this is like his last for all and he knew what he was
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:59.280]  doing and it's actually pretty good character development and screenwriting is it always bothered me
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:06.320]  as a kid that in empire Vader doesn't really want to and not even really he just doesn't want
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:11.200]  to kill Luke he wants to turn Luke and doesn't want to turn him for the emperor I think he's
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:17.280]  truly and sincerely means it when he says join me and we'll go totally he meant that an empire
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:21.840]  tube is that's the whole no no it's only an empire he doesn't even make the offer in return of
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:27.920]  the Jedi it just takes custody of Luke and at that moment where he takes custody of Luke any
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:32.400]  and he takes his lightsaber he says he was carrying this sir and he gives him his lightsaber
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:36.320]  and it's the little I've said this before on other podcasts it's one of my favorite little moments
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:41.440]  in all of the whole series is what does Vader do when he gets Luke's lightsaber well of course
[2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:46.640]  he turns it on and he tries it out a little just waves it around feels the weight it's like
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:49.760]  that's what like when I used to write a skateboard when I was a teenager you get somebody else's
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:53.200]  skateboard what do you do you take you know you may not take it all the way around the block you just
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:57.760]  try it out a little bit see what it's like you know well so the whole father son angle like you're
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:02.160]  coming in the beginning like an empire it's like oh my you're identifying with Luke like oh
[2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:06.640]  Darth Vader is my father what a dramatic revelation and I've said about it and so on so forth
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:11.200]  by the time Jedi comes around you're looking at it from the other direction Vader is going
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:15.200]  Luke is now obviously he's known as Luke is always a son but now he's like I've seen my son this is
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:19.360]  my son if your son made a lightsaber you'd be kind of proud of like hey my son made a pretty good
[2:11:19.360 --> 2:11:25.280]  lightsaber here you know like training is now complete if you are internally a you know a thinking
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:30.000]  feeling person and you meet up with your son like those feelings are gonna be there like the
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.920]  fatherly feelings are gonna be there and that is the feeling that Vader has in Jedi you know
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:37.760]  there is no conflict but there is in the conflict is that you know my son is actually pretty cool
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:42.560]  and I wanted to join me in the last one that that was me rationalizing my I can still be evil
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:46.480]  and still have my son here when it's clear that my son is I'll never join you right
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:49.840]  clear that he's not gonna join me I'm not too gun home kill him because I actually kind of like
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:53.280]  my son he's actually pretty cool he doesn't great things and I feel ashamed of the things
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:57.600]  that I've done in front of my son it's too late for me son blah blah that conflict is present
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.880]  and because Darth Vader wears a mask for all Jedi you get to be like is Luke like wishing that
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:07.440]  was there and it's not really in Darth Vader you know and like many times like you know father
[2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:11.760]  we can he tries it right there on the scene on end or he's like come with me follow we can go
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:15.920]  and like you get nothing from Vader's face mask because it doesn't change expression and you know
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:20.400]  is is Luke totally wrong about Vader or is he right is that what is that when he is that when he
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:24.800]  turns Vader in or at least starts to turn him like he walks off the ad ad and just calls him
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:30.160]  father immediately yeah no that's playing up the angle that's a super power move right like
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:37.040]  hi dad yeah and yeah well the whole the whole that I always thought I saw as a kid was that
[2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:41.600]  why doesn't Vader try make the same offer again and just be like look I'll give you your lightsaber
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:47.360]  back let's go kill this guy you and I have our differences we can sort him out I think he's
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:51.120]  established by the whole you know I was threatening to kill you I cut off your hand I was
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:54.640]  threatening to kill you you can still turn me down like that's not gonna happen nope and then
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.600]  watching it again recent years I think that that's actually the way it plays out and it also fits
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:07.760]  with the way that Luke is clearly a more mature character and more composed at the beginning even
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:13.520]  just at the beginning of return of the Jedi than he was that that's that scene on best been in
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:19.440]  Cloud City that was Vader's chance to turn him well just the fact that he surrenders willingly hands
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:27.760]  over his lightsaber to the storm to the patrol shows a resolve in Luke that I think Vader
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:32.320]  recognizes he won't be able to break and also Luke was optimistic he thought he thought he could
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:35.920]  turn Vader he was right in the end but he thought he could turn his there is good in him I have
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.880]  felt that when did he feel it he felt it after the end of empire when Vader basically Vader could
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:46.320]  have killed the many times when Luke was going off he's like they're communicating telepathically
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:50.560]  as father and son right yeah that's the point where you feel there's some good in him because he
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:54.080]  is not communicate telepathically boy I'm gonna get you Luke when I see you next time I'm gonna
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:58.640]  kill you it's like father son across this this not only that one of my one of my favorite parts
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:05.680]  of empire is when the Falcon finally jumps into hyperspace Vader doesn't kill anybody
[2:14:05.680 --> 2:14:12.080]  he's like he's too he's too depressed a you did everything I told you to you did you disabled
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.800]  the hyperdrive everything it didn't go it didn't work out but my son got away I'm kind of depressed
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:23.120]  and I can't even be bothered to murder anybody at this point yeah yep it's an emotional moment for
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:26.400]  Vader and again we don't see emotion of space because it's just I'm asking it ever changes and it's
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:30.240]  not even that much body language where you've got it just turns around and kind of walks off
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:34.400]  kind of dejected the hothead that was constantly killing people you know the frustrated hothead
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.320]  it was constantly killing people because he wasn't getting what he wanted he realizes that
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:41.600]  nothing could get him what he wanted here because what he wants this is not to love it
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:48.960]  for some reason the helmet is oddly expressive in a certain I wonder if that's like light is it
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:54.720]  the blank canvas right right and and it's you know I think it's all tied with musical cues but
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:00.080]  in like the whole first movie it just looks like the most evil badass mask you can imagine
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:03.680]  and there are some differences I know that in the next two it was a lot more polished
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:10.000]  than like in the first one he changes he changes our movie and they had a problem in the original
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.080]  one of getting the eyes to be completely black and opaque like sometimes there were a little bit
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:18.560]  lighter gray and it was a little bit dangerous Empire I think is the best Vader because it is
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:23.760]  it is sleek and menacing but like you said also there is more body language now it is more
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.080]  expressive with like him reaching out with his hand doing all this stuff like he is able to act
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:34.240]  more with his body in Empire also and in Empire his cape seems to not cover his shoulders a lot
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:38.560]  like you see those big massive shoulder pads a lot more yeah in a waves behind them and there's
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:42.960]  wind like you've got like the body language of Vader when you know the surprise dinner with
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.040]  a oh that's a land of leaving them all open the doors that Vader standing at the head of the
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:53.280]  table both at how cool is Han Solo yeah everybody come on let's just get Han Solo tattoos he knows
[2:15:53.280 --> 2:15:57.440]  he knows two goes law yeah proudest moment it's so good proudest moment stand in front of
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:04.240]  layer and just start shooting that's that's what you do that's it's that's the answer so perfect
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:09.200]  it doesn't work the best the best James Bond and once the best James Bond speaking
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:15.600]  respond like the best James Bond sequences are the sequences in which Bond does Bond reacts in the
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:19.760]  appropriate way before the audience has time to think about what the appropriate way exactly
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:23.040]  because he is the one who's been in the situation many times before and the only reason he's still
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:27.760]  alive is because he immediately knows what to do and there's not a lot of who reaction shot what
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:32.000]  should I do blah blah blah bond as a man of action he immediately we knows when it's action is
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.280]  called for immediately goes into action and it catches the audience by surprise it's the kind of
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:39.760]  bond I like so that everybody wants everybody wants to think they're good in a pinch yeah but
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:45.600]  Han Solo is good but that's the only time I think we've ever seen that I don't know if it's
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:52.400]  the force because he's a robot but he just catches a bunch of laser bolts which is super badass
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:57.280]  but it's kind of the steady ramping up of what is possible but the force you know we knew that
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:01.680]  you could at this point I think we might have known that you could block blaster bolts for the
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:05.280]  lightsaber but he does it with his hands and it shows that he's we don't we don't we don't see
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.240]  that we don't see that till Jedi actually yeah especially like Yoda moves lots of stuff with his
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:15.920]  mind so that shows that it is powerful but he's not teaching Luke like you know karate moves or like
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:20.400]  how to chop things there's not a lot of scenes on Dagobah where he's showing him fancy lightsaber
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:26.640]  moves or society chop stuff you know so you don't you know so it's all the dark side force like
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:30.000]  what would you what would you do with the force if you were not in the Yoda school of how of what
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.240]  the force is all about and that could involve you know blocking links with your hands and then a
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:38.560]  third movie shooting lightning bolts out of your hands like you know we don't know where how far this
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.680]  this leveling tree goes but I would almost say that it comes right out of like a horror movie
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:47.920]  where you don't you know like the monster you just oh shit you can't even shoot this guy
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:52.000]  you go in an empire or the mummy or something it just nothing happens it's like
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:56.480]  and what you want to show there is Han being a man of action and not going
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:59.920]  Vader I knew I would find you because that stupid two goes long block right
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:04.880]  and also showing that Han may have that inclination but he is not of the magic
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:10.800]  using grass and that like his everything he can do it is it's like a child's toy now he'll
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:15.840]  block a few things and take Han's gun and say please sit down because you you Han or that's
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:19.360]  something people like why can't Han solo go and fight Darth Vader why does it have to be look
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:25.680]  well the reason is because he's so it's never been clear to me though I'm not quite sure though
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:29.920]  if that that move of blocking the blaster with your hand because we never see that even in the
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:34.960]  clone wars where the general shot that I it might be because he's got robotic that's what I was
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.880]  thinking I'm not sure I'm just going to go with whatever you think the force has to be involved
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:42.480]  yeah I'm gonna go with it yeah because it's the most powerful thing a little bit
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:46.960]  Vader do and fine I'm gonna go a little bit column a little bit column B it's both like maybe
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:50.400]  Vader's like the only guy who could really maybe would really screw up your hand if you had a
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:19:01.840]  real hand but whatever you know like either way you've got a rope on hand afterwards
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:07.680]  as a small small observation this is such a small detail but it seems as though the
[2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:17.840]  the advances in what would you call it what do you call it like like when somebody gets an
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:24.240]  artificial limb oh prosthetics prosthetics prosthetic technology advanced pretty
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:29.520]  significantly in the 22 you think it's the only technology that could have also been a fashion
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.920]  choice like one is try to make it look at most like a human hand and the other one is can you
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.160]  make me into a machine of war yeah that's a two different goals so wait wait well even if
[2:19:38.160 --> 2:19:42.720]  it's too late when he's got yeah yeah I'm not even talking about Vader I'm talking about
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:47.360]  thing going young and again you know that could also be a style choice too because it wasn't it
[2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:52.640]  was like steampunk it was like well kind of brass and gone it was kind of like art deco steampunk
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:57.600]  kind of thing which a lot of the aesthetic of like Luke went to a nice cosmetic search yeah
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:04.640]  yeah you got a real hand which is this poor old Papi got like steampunk a steam engine attached
[2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:20.560]  to his wrist how are we doing on time I know that it's getting late we have 15 more minutes
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:38.160]  yeah for sure do you got to do another sponsor uh maybe I do at the very least I want to show
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:43.680]  at the very least I want uh I want John to get a good night's sleep before going to work oh yeah
[2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:48.960]  no work tomorrow you don't work tomorrow now get off what are you okay we're getting a couple of
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:55.920]  others yeah all right well I'm gonna take one more break and thank our third sponsor it's our
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:03.600]  good friend at Casper I think I remember Casper Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:08.240]  and they sell them for a fraction of the price now first time I heard about this I thought holy
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:13.200]  shit this is crazy how would buy a mattress online well guess what it makes a lot of sense it's
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:17.520]  almost like you know eventually we're gonna buy everything online and we're never gonna have to leave
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:24.880]  the house um the mattress industry is so crooked it's ridiculous you go from one mattress store to
[2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:29.200]  another you can't compare prices because the ceilings they sell in one store all have different
[2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:34.640]  model names from another store and they're all marked up and there's almost like a cartel of a few
[2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:43.520]  high priced manufacturers who collaborate together it to keep prices high it's it's just a racket
[2:21:43.520 --> 2:21:48.560]  and it's a real pain in the ass if you've ever done it so what do you do you go to Casper and it's
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:52.400]  so much easier they don't make you choose between stuff you don't understand they have one kind
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:59.680]  of mattress it's a hybrid that combines latex foam and memory foam new mattresses and retail
[2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:06.720]  stores typically cost over 1500 bucks Casper mattresses cost between 500 for a twin size mattress
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:16.000]  uh 750 for full size 850 for queen and just 950 bucks for a king size mattress now how do you get a
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:21.280]  mattress shipped to your house this is the part that baffled me I had no idea they vacuum pack these
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:26.400]  things using I don't even know how they do it but it comes it doesn't come in a tiny box it's not like
[2:22:26.400 --> 2:22:31.760]  you're getting like a little pill and you put water on it turns into a mattress comes in a box
[2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:37.680]  like the size of a like a dorm room refrigerator maybe a little bigger than that easily fits through a
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:44.800]  door you can see how they ship them uh then you open the thing up and it just expands into a
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:52.160]  I one thing I would say follow their directions open it in a room where you want to use it's really
[2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:57.200]  really amazing and uh they sent me one a couple months ago and they first sponsored the show it's
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:03.520]  a fine mattress it is really good uh I don't expect that I'll ever buy a mattress in a store again
[2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:16.480]  um where do you go to find out more go to CasperSleep C-A-S-P-E-R-S-L-E-E-P CasperSleep.com slash talk show just talk
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:23.840]  show that I don't have the the um it's got a nice sink it's got nice bounce it's not the memory
[2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:27.280]  foam thing where like when you wake up in the morning there's like an outline of your body
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:32.720]  on the mattress I can't stand that uh I wouldn't like that uh it's not like that at all it's just
[2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:38.720]  a nice mattress just feels good um and here's the thing they're made right here in America made in
[2:23:38.720 --> 2:23:45.360]  America uh and the other thing too you think I just can't see spend in you know 800,000 bucks on a
[2:23:45.360 --> 2:23:52.240]  mattress online they have a risk-free return policy try sleeping on any Casper for a hundred days
[2:23:52.240 --> 2:23:59.120]  get three months with the thing and if you don't like it free for free they'll take it back
[2:23:59.120 --> 2:24:05.760]  take it out of your house so you can't lose go there buy a mattress open it up in the room where
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:10.960]  you want to use it three months and then if you don't like it you can send it back uh if you
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:15.760]  need a new mattress you're not if you don't check out uh Casper so go to CasperSleep.com
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:22.080]  and uh slash the talk show oh slash the talk show no that even I got that wrong
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:27.680]  so that brings me to a point here's a point I wanted to make it's a funny time but I wanted to make
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:34.320]  this before we wrap up the show one thing that Star Wars does and I think it's a good thing
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:40.640]  but it doesn't really make any logical sense is there just always been very hand-wavy
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:47.040]  yada yada yada dot dot dot about how long it takes to get from one planet to another in hyperspace
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:52.720]  it's it's seemingly a big deal to get from Tatooine to Aldaran because they have to pay
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:25:00.160]  uh 10,000 credit 10,000 credit 17,000 and it's enough that Luke says we could almost buy our own ship
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:07.280]  it's you know uh but how long is it nobody changes their clothes well you know they do
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:11.600]  the movie is not about long space flights so that's not an important part of the movie needs to
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:14.400]  be in there and all you got to do is make it seem like a really long car trip because that's
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:18.240]  what people can relate to it's gonna be like a really long car trip guys and then that's how
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:22.000]  much time you have in terms of time passing the movie that's how I like well if you're and
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.600]  if you're in some town in the middle of nowhere and you want to get to the big city you gotta
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:29.680]  somehow get there either by doing a long car trip or taking a bus or train or something like that
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:32.880]  I guess it's not a lot of public transportation in the galaxy but if you can have any galaxy
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:37.360]  spanning civilization you just got a hand wave travel time and there is some notion of that
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:43.680]  Tarkin does not want to blow up Dantooine because it's too remote to make an effective demonstration
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:47.920]  yeah I don't know what the media situation is yeah like it's far far away but the media
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:52.080]  situation is again you know if we're gonna say all this tatooine is remote like they don't have any
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:57.760]  kind of galactic media that is sort of giving any sort of shared like they're not all watching
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:01.360]  space sign felt together they're not all the same page in terms of culture then I'll
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:04.960]  be listening to the same songs they're not interested in news about what's going on in the
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:09.440]  other systems if you're a remote enough system you could be like rebellion empire it doesn't
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:13.280]  really affect me you were kind of in the lowest planet run by the Hudson anyway so no big deal
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:18.480]  it's more like the entire galaxy is about the size of the United States and it's in the United
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:24.480]  States like in the in the pre-interstate highway age yeah tatooine is like Arizona there's
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:27.920]  Nevada you got the wild west it's a little bit of the wild west and you got what's going on
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:32.080]  with the big city and there is organized crime and maybe this prohibition and you know like
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:38.560]  that type of communication delay and here's you guys in the american centric line of thinking
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:45.520]  but yeah I I I don't know what about this timeline so this timeline to me is all it's just
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:50.560]  is very I accept it I don't mind it but it if you think about it too much it's pretty hard to
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:27:00.480]  explain is the falcon leaves hot and hyperdrive hyperdrive doesn't work so they go hide in an asteroid
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:05.200]  field because at the very least we can go there and these star destroyers will start stop shooting
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:12.720]  at it so far so good I'll it just just forget that the spaceworm somehow gets huge on an asteroid
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:17.360]  with no atmosphere and yeah whatever whatever the biology of that thing is what's the
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:24.240]  it it's spaceships yeah it eats hydrogen so what so what it's a good was a cool scene and a great
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:29.280]  surprise so I forgive it but they don't have a hyperdrive and they never fix the hyperdrive
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:35.840]  and then Han is flipping through his computer and he goes lando huh and so somehow he can get
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:40.960]  to best bin which is why it's you know it in that system that they're in the anoyed system
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:54.400]  or where are we you know how many left no atmosphere is not much that's it so left the hot system they're in the
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:58.080]  scientifically speaking yeah that's the way but then but then he's going to go to best or the
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:03.760]  lando system quote unquote so sorry continue to but that that's a different solar system right
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.520]  it's not they're not trying to say that best bin is on a different planet in the hot solar
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:11.200]  system I don't I actually don't know someone someone I don't know it's more about Star Wars could
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:15.120]  probably map this out for us but I don't think so because I think that also mean the planet
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:22.720]  being the central and the moons being the system right I think that the Lucy Guzy you know
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:28.080]  Star Wars scientific explanation is that hyperdrive is really really fast and gets you you know
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:33.840]  like you said like a couple hours you can get from one A to B and if you don't take hyperdrive
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:39.760]  there's still some kind of faster than light way that you're going to get there not not like
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:43.520]  a hundred years from now you're going to get there in a couple of weeks because that's the whole
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:49.280]  period where Luke is training on Dagobah yeah exactly right the time it takes the Falcon to get
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:55.680]  from the asteroids to best bin is the time the entirety of the time that Luke trains either Luke
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:01.200]  spends the grand total of about eight hours training or those guys are sitting around playing an
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:05.280]  awful lot of that video that that table's in copper all episodes because we covered the same
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:10.000]  talk it's topics in fact this was the the title of one of the episodes of an empire was Jedi
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.840]  Weekend because we were discussing how long did you spend how long did you spend on Dagobah's
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:18.080]  you there for a month is there for a week or is it just like a Jedi Weekend what's the show you
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:24.160]  speaker oh you should put it in your shots I would and by the way I just google that as I there's
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:29.920]  a question on the SWTR.com how did Han get the best in with best bin with no light speed it's a
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:34.240]  question right in the forums and the first answer is that it's pothole yeah no do you know what
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:42.800]  I'll tell you what um this is classic comic book writing like the heroes only ever as powerful as
[2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:48.160]  you needn't to be very given seen like Superman can move the moon in one scene and then just get
[2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:59.200]  beaten down by Batman in the next scene it's it's fine like I think you know Scott McNulty forgive me
[2:29:59.200 --> 2:30:04.640]  but Star Trek kind of overly fetishizes this kind of thing and it's just a detail it doesn't matter
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:09.440]  it's it has nothing to do with the narrative expression of the story right like Star Trek has
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:15.280]  gone on like to explain that the warp factor uh the warp factor going from zero to 10 is like a
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:18.960]  logarithm yeah and if they've changed they've you know they've changed it a couple of times in order
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:23.600]  to make it make more sense given the end so apparently Hoth and Bespin are both in the you know
[2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:31.280]  ad system you essentially oh my god oh my god look at this she knows that this was backwards
[2:30:31.280 --> 2:30:37.760]  this is somebody who this really bothered yes really bothered them and they were like I'm
[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:42.000]  blessing it's like watching awesome I like it because because the expanded universe everything has
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:45.520]  to explain all this like you know people who are more intimate know all these answers are ready
[2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:49.040]  because they have to make you know the movie gets to do throwaway lines when you write novel after
[2:30:49.040 --> 2:30:52.720]  novel in this universe you have to eventually figure out where everything is or no wait no wait that
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:57.120]  it's a second it's not the same solar system it's a sector seems right so yes I mean it doesn't
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:01.920]  matter it's all just it's all just hand-waste you need faster than your travel life faster than life
[2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:07.840]  I I and I feel like the movie doesn't suffer for it at all and if they had and it would have been
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:13.440]  a whole mid-aclorian moment if they had gone the whole Star Trek factor and explained that we can no
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:19.120]  longer go in hyperdrive pass speed one but but but but it doesn't matter does just
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:23.360]  Star Trek doesn't do that either started basically just says if if it's a dramatic part of a plot
[2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:27.680]  we would simply have someone explain in the moment that whatever speed we're going now is either
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:32.720]  adequate or inadequate for some made up reason to escape or not escape from it's like when they're
[2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:37.360]  trying to do via trying to get out of the black hole in the JJ Abrams reboot like the yeah the big
[2:31:37.360 --> 2:31:40.000]  hole going and the red matter and they're trying to go away from it like we're all where it
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:43.600]  maximum warp are not going to make it out blow a thing up like they just need a dramatic moment
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:48.480]  like there's no there's no before that they didn't have long discussions about what it would be like
[2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:53.040]  trying to escape from an anti-matter bomb with warp engines whether it could it does matter
[2:31:53.040 --> 2:31:57.200]  just you just need a dramatic moment in the moment something else something that set that tells you
[2:31:57.200 --> 2:32:00.880]  the room you can't do that too much because then you get Dr. Hoot yeah exactly but in terms of
[2:32:00.880 --> 2:32:08.880]  vampire what we needed is we needed Luke to be trained by Yoda and we needed time for Han and Leia
[2:32:08.880 --> 2:32:17.040]  to sort of come together in some kind of way and sort of the downtime in both the asteroid field
[2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:24.160]  and on Dagobah provides that story tempo right and then after you after you're done with that it's
[2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:30.800]  you know wave your hands and it's on to the next thing right and it also makes sense then that
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:34.880]  the empire could have gotten there before they did because they have ships with fully functioning
[2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:40.720]  hyper drives and could get there and you know work out there dastardly yeah I mean clearly I mean well
[2:32:40.720 --> 2:32:46.000]  yeah what is not to say they got there just before you did so oh does he say that just before
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:51.200]  well I mean obviously enough before that you know they just have time to plan a dinner party
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:58.880]  I always thought that was pretty classy he's totally classy that was the bond villainy
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:05.440]  yes yeah he's pretty classy the whole time and and I you know I think it makes sense to test
[2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:10.560]  the carbonite freezing on hand yeah would you not why would you not do that like
[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:15.120]  and again it's like we don't want the emperor's prize damage but even at that point
[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:18.800]  you could be saying maybe he doesn't want to of course he doesn't want to of course he wants to
[2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:21.920]  us to meet us to meet a son I mean even at that point if he's got delusions that it's going to be
[2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:27.840]  like father and son the evil duo yeah yeah either way he doesn't want it to who would want
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:32.480]  you know just not that's fine do you think it's made further uncomfortable I mean I presume that
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:37.680]  they did get a meal I do I got to that they did that a robot chicken I think the robot
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:40.800]  chicken parody where they they play out the rest of that scene where they're all really eating
[2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:45.920]  and like I didn't oh I have to put this in the show I think it's about chicken it's got it
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:52.880]  yeah what's what's Vader doing he's just sitting there so well Vader Vader and Boba both were
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.240]  masks that they don't take off right oh yeah I forget Boba Fett steps in from the side
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:02.160]  they just want to see other people enjoying their food right right being in that scene is
[2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:07.520]  basically just a fuck you to Han Solo at that point yeah he has no side he's like no reason to be
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:13.040]  there other than like hey I got you it's just to rub it in oh I guess he wants the bounty he's
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:20.640]  like you know yeah I guess he's worth a lot to me yeah like do you think Vader ate eight
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:25.840]  his meals alone in his little meditation chamber yeah so I'm gonna take the down one off
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:31.840]  in front of the big screen put on some sports yeah I'm just oh my god you remember in the
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.800]  prequels and they had like robots playing football some kind of American style football oh yeah
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:41.440]  yeah it's so horrible well in Star Wars Rebels they bring back that little whatever it's called
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:45.520]  the circular table and the falcon with a little uh yeah I should play animation monsters yeah
[2:34:45.520 --> 2:34:51.520]  what is that game called I don't know I'm sure this name I'm cool with that but really
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:54.480]  playing American for George playing American football is just come on what
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:01.360]  or even something vaguely yeah sure whatever I mean they go ahead basically yeah they look
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:06.240]  like a line of blockers and they could somebody with the football okay once you've got a 50s
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:13.680]  diner all bets are yeah I know so let's blow through the prequel trilogy and can we just
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:19.360]  blow it up instead yeah but to me among the worst things all right the dialogue is terrible
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.720]  throughout the character motivations are terrible through yeah the definition of who's the main
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:29.280]  characters in this movie are terrible yeah so you get you get that from the the blanket things
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:35.920]  right I am yeah that's the red letter media it's I watched them again at I would hardly
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:41.200]  recommend them except for all of the weird side plot stuff that I don't I don't like the
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:44.960]  blanket things I don't like the characterization of the framing device at this point listen I think
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.760]  the framing device I think and the thing about the no the no main character which a lot of people
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:54.320]  pull away from that uh in ensemble movies it's perfectly fine that it who's the main character
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:36:00.160]  in the usual suspects right who's who's the main character in firefly like it is impossible to have
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:04.400]  you know or you can have arguments oh mouse the main character in firefly or always use Kevin
[2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:08.240]  Spacey the main character in usual suspects or is it uh Gabriel Byrne like you know like
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:12.720]  ensemble cast are fine who's the main character in oceans 11 is it George Clooney because he's the
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:17.440]  most famous and got paid the most like ensemble cast are fine but that what he was trying to get at
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:21.520]  with the who's the main character in the Phantom Menace is that we don't care about any of these people
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:26.640]  like right I totally the main characters like who do I care about who do I identify with who
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:30.560]  should have been Kenobi why who am I rooting for and in Phantom Master answer is nobody because
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:34.880]  they're all just cardboard cut out the entire prequel should have been Kenobi and and
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:42.000]  you know we talked about failure uh to uh effectively save Anakin from going to the dark side
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:45.040]  you're like who the hell's quite gone never heard him before yeah and he's pointless
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:50.960]  there were and in fact there will be same or trained by Yoda so what why we you know uh and I
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:57.360]  like me I like I like everybody's trained by Yoda it's like saying well I was taught by famous
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:01.200]  professor at famous school you really weren't really maybe had one class with him but yeah that's
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:04.880]  you know so everyone's always trained by Yoda because he's sort of the head of the training high
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:09.920]  right but anyway like yeah introducing all like every level of the prequel says problems you can
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:12.880]  get a little picky-y-yune things you can complain about them in the micro level and you can
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:15.680]  pull all the way back to level though I always like to go out and says they just failed in their
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:21.200]  fundamental tasks explain why Anna can turn to the yeah they I think the reason quite gone exists is
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:26.640]  because of where all one of the reasons is that I feel like Lucas got a bug up his butt to have a
[2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:31.760]  parallel to the first one where you know there's this great moment where Obi-Wan sacrifices
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:36.480]  himself and dies and you know oh my god this Jedi it was so wise and sage and powerful
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:40.320]  throughout this movie all of a sudden he's dead I didn't expect that well I want that again but it
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:44.960]  can't be Obi-Wan because I need Obi-Wan you know for the next six movies and so we'll invent
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:49.360]  this new guy and then what happens to Obi-Wan well he gets to sit on a spaceship for 45 minutes
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:56.880]  so the one thing I will say about that Obi-Wan thing is that uh Qui-Wan's death kind of gives him
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:04.800]  the the option at least to do what Luke did in Return of the Jedi where he just goes bananas
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:10.480]  and and really whales on uh Darth Maul another character we don't care about but that doesn't really
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:15.920]  even happen as as the plinket thing points out well but he does but then you don't get there's
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:19.840]  no payoff there's no there's no idea that Obi-Wan is constantly teetering on the edge of the
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:26.560]  story yeah what you get is more like Qui-Wan is kind of like the the the problem student who's
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:33.680]  always a little bit disrespectful and uh and kind of you know I don't know like a little bit of a
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:37.520]  rebel but never do you get the idea that Qui-Wan is teetering on the edge of the dark side of the
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:42.800]  Obi-Wan and so they're kind of like they're kind of like the the you know the the trouble
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:46.400]  stuice but you know where is it the Luke's whole thing is like yeah you're two doing the edge of
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:51.360]  the dark so when Obi-Wan goes nuts and starts whaling on them we're not sad music is not playing
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:56.800]  we are rooting for Obi-Wan to win he does win there is no you know pacifism so I've got two
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:04.240]  things about that first of all I loved I mean so visually that battle was stunning as is contrived
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:13.120]  just as it was it looked pretty cool um I liked that uh as those arbitrary doors closed like
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:19.440]  laser doors closed uh Qui-Wan sat down and meditated while deathmal stalked back and forth
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:29.200]  that was nice I liked it uh I liked that after Qui-Wan had been killed Obi-Wan was like jumping up and
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:34.240]  down like just way to the girl like he's clearly pissed right uh but you're right there was no payoff
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:42.080]  and worse than there being no payoff and this is horrible um he ends up in uh like a tactically
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:46.720]  inferior position he's basically falling halfway down the hall and it's got no lightsaber and he
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:52.800]  manages to beat deathmal by jumping over him force grabbing a lightsaber and cutting him in half
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:57.520]  it's the henchman thing when henchman's and movie henchman in the movies like just get into
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:01.200]  position in front of the hero and stand motion unless while the hero does some cool move exactly
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:09.040]  now here's the thing that is an incredibly inferior position and at the end of um the event of the
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:18.640]  Sith we see we we have Kenobi and it it it could marginally elevated position over over uh
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:24.160]  Anakin and they have to and they do the same the lines up because like I need you to understand
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:29.200]  that now I have the advantage because I want you to know that the decision anakin makes but
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:33.040]  it's a fighter not doesn't make like it's just it doesn't make any sense because we've seen
[2:40:33.040 --> 2:40:38.800]  we've seen Kenobi beat way crazier odds against a guy that was you know our group arguably
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:44.400]  Maul was like probably one of the better fighters that we've seen right so it's it's it's just it's
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:50.720]  so it's so fresh. It's non sense of what every possible level you go you go really picky you're
[2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:55.120]  like medium level like for moment to moment seem to see an action to action motivation to
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:00.160]  motivation like the fight scenes make no sense the the larger stories make no sense. It's like
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:06.320]  it at any level of zoom you still get the poo emoji is is what yeah to to jump to that
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:11.840]  vater not vater well he was vater but the Anakin Obi-Wan's fight in in revenge of the Sith
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:17.040]  in in that very fight scene it is I never thought about it before how it parallels the
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:21.360]  Darth Maul you're in a lower position and he didn't even have a lightsaber in his hand yet
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:26.240]  you're right though that is is pretty damning but even in that one fight scene in the
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.960]  ebb and flow of one guy having the upper hand one guy having the lower hand you know upper hand
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:36.000]  lower hand you know ebb and flow the fight's going back and forth that was so far and away not
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.600]  the worst position one of them in in in those guys would come back from so much worse position
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:46.960]  everyone to go to father level in that in that scene where the two of them fighting you want the fight
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:50.880]  to not be about the fight you want it to be about something else but the something else it's about
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:54.480]  is so stupid and you don't care about it at all and you've totally checked out an Anakin as a
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.400]  character for three whole movies you could give a damn about what the like the underlying you
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:04.320]  didn't even check out you never check it you just yeah right exactly but no it's like if you're
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:09.840]  gonna have a long fight scene like culminate you know a trilogy of movies a long fight scene between
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:14.800]  two people you have to have established whatever the underlying issue is to the degree that the
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:18.240]  attention of the fight scene is not just about the fighting part but by the time episode three comes
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:23.360]  along you're just like whatever just that's why it just seems like all this drags on so long
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.520]  and it's boring who cares who cares who win you know who wins you know what happens you don't
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:31.120]  there's no emotional stakes you don't care about any of the people and then the mechanics of
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:34.960]  the fight scene aren't any interesting phantom medicine thing had a well choreographed fight scene
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:41.360]  with some interesting things in it that didn't make too much sense did you care about the characters
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:44.720]  maybe you kind of cared about oblong because you know he was gonna be quite gone I mean
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:49.360]  Liam Mason is fairly charismatic and his character was vaguely interesting dothmall was a total
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:54.800]  cipher was stupid and then they killed him so so much for that yeah he was almost like a red shirt
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:59.040]  yeah he really was just a red shirt it was just like a big mean look at scary guy who's got like
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:03.040]  two lines and you're only reason you you think he's intimidating is because like you assume he's
[2:43:03.040 --> 2:43:08.400]  a good fighter and you later to see that he is and that he seems scary but I mean Vader had a
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:12.480]  whole movie to be intimidating before he took out oblong yeah dothmall was like you saw him briefly
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:18.000]  yeah I feel that that that final fight would have almost been better served at just I don't know
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:23.600]  like we want to kick down a door and just eviscerates I can't like immediately just chop it into pieces
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:28.560]  like because that's what you need to have happen like that's well I mean you need to have
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:32.560]  that you need to have the emotional payoff of whatever their supposed conflict is about and whatever
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:36.960]  is like oh and why are you trying to but they it is just so squander to that yeah yeah it's like
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:42.960]  whatever but I feel like what happens once you've decided once once Kenobi has decided
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.200]  I think there needs to be a decisive thing and what happened was not decisive really you know
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:51.920]  I will be almost supposedly holding back it's like I really don't want to kill you I can kill you
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:56.320]  because you're a stupid kid and you didn't take all my lessons that I'm a good fighter I can but I
[2:43:56.320 --> 2:44:00.720]  don't want to I'm trying to convince you and talk you down from it eventually like I hope the
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:05.760]  hard ground if the next move you make is like he just says to the audience like I'm setting up a
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:10.160]  scenario which now this fight is over now and I'm telling you that the decision Anakin makes
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:14.880]  now will determine whether the fight ends for him and for me and the the rash move would be for
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:18.160]  him I'm telling him don't do this rash move because I'm in a superior position even though
[2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:21.760]  that makes no sense the kind of it's entire fight I'm simply like where it's where it's
[2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:27.760]  what if the script is run out so now yeah I'm just going to tell you what is going to happen
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:32.320]  here I can't actually make it happen organically through a story you know where things were events
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:36.320]  unfold and situations arise we can't have that because that would be too complicated I'm just going
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.960]  to tell us at the ending part kind of a dick move to let your friends slash I thought if you
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:46.800]  like a brother to burn a life maybe you know put him out of his misery yeah god doesn't
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:52.000]  make a sense like do I try to save him like even Batman saves the Joker yeah I'm going to take
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:57.360]  your lights and I'm gonna hand you later and you it's like I don't know if we're supposed to believe
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:00.960]  that he thought well he's a goner or we're just let him burn to death and it's like it doesn't
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:06.240]  make any sense like there is no there's no reason it has to play out that way like they just
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:09.120]  just like when you're writing the script this is the type of thing you think about like
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:12.640]  you know where you want to go and you have to have a series of events that leads naturally to
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:17.360]  right you need to track can't you can't force me to trap your protagonist into a course of action
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:23.200]  that needs you down down the path that you've voted and nothing was nothing was forcing over
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:26.160]  Obi-Wan have like an appointment he had to get to all right well I wouldn't pull you out a
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:30.560]  level but I it's not it's not even that hard to think of something very close where you're
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:34.400]  all right you're and this is one of those things that I don't know if you guys remember but I
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:40.080]  remember even as a kid that the fan magazines had rumors that if they're ever if they ever made
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:46.080]  the prequel trilogy that the way that Vader got the way he was and the whole reference to you know
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:50.320]  the you know last we met I was put the learner now on the master you know that these guys
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:55.760]  knew each other was that you know there were rumors all the way back then like 80 81 that it was
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:00.640]  some kind of lightsaber duel and Obi-Wan knocked him into lava and that's what screwed him up
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:05.760]  something something Vader you know Obi-Wan gave him a ass kicking and he fell in so just make
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:10.720]  it an edge you know you're on a cliff or something like a volcano and you he cuts off his arm
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:16.800]  his lightsaber falls to the ground and he falls into a pit of all and he does it's an intentional
[2:46:16.800 --> 2:46:20.480]  intention like if I wanted to do it what I would have I mean you got to have a whole other
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:23.920]  different three movies in front of the street over this but what you'd want to have happen is to
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:28.800]  have them have whatever underlying issue and have it play out through through a lightsaber thing
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:35.920]  and have basically have Obi-Wan try and fail to save him right from the lava thing like that
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:39.680]  it's not like he he like hit him into the lava then in second thoughts and try to save them that
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:45.440]  like the fight led to a situation in which Anakin was going to have was going to fall in the lava
[2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:50.000]  and the the battle was Obi-Wan trying to save him right now like Obi-Wan pushed him into the
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.680]  lobby in second thoughts was then you have will he need to try to save him both from the going to
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:58.720]  the dark side and from the ultimate physical demise right right ever been a bit of a handsome what
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.080]  youth want that want the conflict to be if you want the conflict to be that it can feel like he
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:06.000]  was betrayed by Obi-Wan then you could have it to be like you know Obi-Wan trying to show him
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:09.440]  that he wasn't betrayed if you want the conflict to be something different like a love a triangle
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:12.720]  or some other like I don't know it depends on the conflict how you want to play out but you
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:16.720]  but you've already written a thing where he has to survive and he's also hard and messed up
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:22.080]  and Obi-Wan has his saber those things were already set so you haven't cut off his hand his sabers
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:26.880]  there on the ground he falls in the pit and he's gone and you know Obi-Wan's not nuts he's not jumping
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:32.240]  down into a lava pit to make sure the guy's dead he just assumes he's dead and somehow he's still
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:37.040]  so powerful and he's got the dark side he can keep himself alive in a lava pit even while he's getting
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.280]  all burned up and there you go you're done or I mean I think you probably also I would have
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:44.880]  Obi-Wan to know that he's still alive and know that he has failed to save him but they're
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:49.120]  they're you know like because yeah that's because he's not as hiding on Tatooine so he knows
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:53.440]  like who who is he hiding Luke from if he thinks Vader is well I like the idea of Vader being
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:48:01.040]  there's like being a thing and then slowly it's you know Obi-Wan recognizes her like oh my god that
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:05.680]  that's what happened yeah I wouldn't be ties a lot of it yeah I know the lava pit is from it's from
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:09.760]  Lucas it's from the fan magazines from way back but who cares how to go to that that's pretty
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:13.600]  hand-fisted because it's like first of all Lord of the Rings did it first and second of all
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:18.720]  and then it's slightly differently it's second of all like anything we were established anything
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:23.120]  that involves like a pratfall or a slapstick or like whoop I lost my balance and fell into this
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:28.160]  thing it's like it's such an ignorant oh my god imagine it dropped out and it came into like a
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:33.360]  cell like a pit yeah someone bumped into him like he was just walking on one of those various walkways
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:42.880]  that has no railings on it and like they tried to pass each other too yeah so the whole the whole
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:50.160]  prequel trilogy I feel like it mostly in hindsight it's a like fan fiction ask trying to
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:55.040]  write in as many coincidences as possible you know like you've already mentioned don't say
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:03.760]  see the C3PO made by a boyhood you know Anakin even though he's clearly as we've seen through
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.240]  all of the movies like he's right off the assembly line he's right off the assembly line there's
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:13.680]  like other protocol to look exactly like him and again was not a very imaginative child they
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:20.880]  just made one looks exactly like the ones you have like a radio shack it's like a kid but somehow
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:27.360]  he didn't have the outer shell for him you know to jango fat we all we've killed Boba
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:31.040]  fat and he was a badass so we can't still have him around but we'll just put his father in
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:37.840]  and then we'll say that he's oh also that cool fat guy he's the the parent of all the clones
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:44.160]  he's the template clone zero that's horrible that it seems like you're getting away from that
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:51.920]  and then well who knows but I don't even you could listen forever I'd say flaw number two is
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:50:00.240]  turning the Jedi from these like martial artists who are masters of subtlety to superheroes
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:06.160]  right like it just suddenly jumped from you know like these guys who specialize mostly in like
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:10.640]  going unnoticed I mean that's what Obi-Wan does in like to shut down the reactor beam it's
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:17.280]  awesome it's so cool in the first movie the way Obi-Wan is this lone old man he just makes a
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:22.160]  crazy noise yeah in a way he doesn't go slice him dice him he just you know right and there's
[2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:27.440]  this totally cool scene you know super cool scene where there's the two stormtroopers by the
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:32.240]  the tractor beam control and you know it's like if you've seen the new TK-421 it's pretty
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:35.600]  I heard it's quite a thing to see your memory of Star Wars lines is quite a mission
[2:50:35.600 --> 2:50:42.960]  and TK-421 is Han Solo yeah all right what's whatever the model name is what's the model name
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:47.680]  of the sky jumper that he's talking about whatever it's like if you've seen the new the new
[2:50:47.680 --> 2:50:53.600]  Camaro it's just a cool scene and it's a nice little it's like George Lucas when he made films
[2:50:53.600 --> 2:50:57.760]  for humans it's like well you know what that's probably what strong troopers would talk about you
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:03.040]  know cool spaceships and stuff like that and then all he does is make like a little noise like
[2:51:03.040 --> 2:51:08.160]  you know they hear something over there they turn their heads and boom he's gone perfect that's
[2:51:08.160 --> 2:51:13.360]  what the jedi's did and then whole trilogy it's established that they're like marvel superheroes
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:21.040]  and they don't want to know what's like when you know growing up that that line of like
[2:51:21.040 --> 2:51:27.360]  you know I fought in the clone wars with your father I never thought of it like they were
[2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:33.600]  generals and I think I just thought that they fought together and they happened to be oh sorry
[2:51:33.600 --> 2:51:40.240]  yeah I did but I didn't think that they were commanders of troops no no no I didn't think that
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:47.200]  they were outside of the weird general command structure right I just thought that they were jedi
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:54.080]  that happened to be part of the army yeah I mean like yeah I thought the channel that's not a jedi
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:59.440]  that's not a problem you can have you know but the the people certainly sort of preclude that
[2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:03.440]  possibility that like yeah when I when I was a kid when I thought of them you fought fighting the
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:08.240]  clone wars what I pictured was them fighting in the way the luke was aspiring to fight and that they
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:13.440]  were pilots of you know x-wings or whatever and they were shooting things with guns and flying
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:16.880]  x-wings around in the fact they happened to have the force maybe gave them a little bit better
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:20.400]  piloting skills but in general that's how they were operating within the machinery of the war
[2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:25.040]  as young men so that you fought in the clone wars as a warrior of the type that's who wasn't that
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:29.280]  that's exactly it yeah and maybe you pull out a blast and you blast some people but when you need to
[2:52:29.280 --> 2:52:33.520]  get the the honor thing going you can pull out you like saving them they were a bunch of
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:37.520]  priests and robes running around and there was some I mean that was the problem of the prequels is
[2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:42.960]  that you know so if you're gonna if you're gonna do the timeline and you're gonna make jedi's normal
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:48.720]  and you're gonna have a lot of them they're they're no longer special and you have to embrace that to
[2:52:48.720 --> 2:52:54.160]  a degree that the prequels didn't feel comfortable embracing like it's as if you had a movie in which
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:59.840]  one person had a gun and it was a big special thing or you know like the steaming the guns the
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:04.400]  gunslinger series guns or a rarity or whatever and then you do prequels to them where everybody
[2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:07.760]  has guns if you're gonna do the movie where everybody has guns you have to do it like saving private
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:11.680]  right where guns are not part of the story at all it's just normal and you move on from it very
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:16.160]  quickly on to whatever the actual story is the story is not can you believe all these guys have guns
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:21.280]  right yeah now we know they all have like it's normal you have to have another story there
[2:53:21.280 --> 2:53:25.040]  that's the story of that you know a dramatic thing happening in war whatever see if you're gonna
[2:53:25.040 --> 2:53:29.600]  have a million jedi running around the jedi can't be that special and you have to have another
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:33.120]  story that takes place and people just happen to have light sabers in the same way that people
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:38.720]  happen to happen anymore completely agree and one thing that I always liked about Star Wars that I
[2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:44.160]  that I feel has been sort of betrayed over the years um is something that sets it apart from
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:53.440]  Star Trek and in Star Trek each alien species or they call them races each alien race has a prescribed
[2:53:53.440 --> 2:54:01.440]  set of um sort of values and a cultural aspect to it like Klingons or warriors the frangier
[2:54:01.440 --> 2:54:08.000]  traitors like the humans are vaguely fleshed out the Romulans are duplicitous the Vulcans are
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  logical and I always thought and I think it stems from the from the cantina scene is Star Wars that
[2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:20.320]  these are just a bunch of people hanging out or aliens like it's you could have
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.640]  Grito can be an asshole but that doesn't mean that everybody who looks like Grito is going to be
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:29.520]  a bounty hunter out to kill people well you've got the huts that are all gangsters suppose
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:33.520]  there's like but not in the movies family but it's not in the movies that they don't say it is
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:38.400]  jab at the hut that's all you hear about well no but I didn't mention that the huts run the show
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:44.320]  sure but I mean that could be I mean maybe the hut is for as far as I know that's her family name
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:49.040]  I don't know yeah exactly maybe it's just and and but they that's what I mean about it it's
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:54.800]  being slowly betrayed over the years of this notion of like this group or you know there's this
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:55:00.480]  alien species acts in this way and there is a nice touch like that it would Star Wars
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:04.960]  I you know if we're going to be be nice and say nice things about the prequels in the
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:10.880]  in Phantom Menace one of Anakin's childhood friends is a yes except I think he's Grito
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:17.120]  I think he's actually Grito well oh you do I think they call him Grito I really do
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:23.200]  oh it's hard yeah don't judge the judge you know does it yeah the jedi council oh my god
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:29.600]  no that's Grito oh god that's hard I'll go check I try I try to forget that it's it's more
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:34.960]  work Davis anyway it's work Davis I think they call him Gita but the jedi council in
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:38.240]  Phantom Menace though is the kind of the united college had been a time of their life anyone
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:41.680]  can be in jedi so they take every single star wars race they try to throw in one of them
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:46.720]  including whatever your it is because they've got a yaddle thing so we right one thing oh man I've
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:52.320]  just I'm going to use this just to air all of my star wars grievances that yoda should not
[2:55:52.320 --> 2:55:57.120]  have a let's ever I never thought I was eight years old when I was like no you there's no way
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:03.040]  yoda should ever lose or whenever it came out it doesn't you don't you don't just
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:09.120]  I would just talk about being a kid before jedi came out oh no it was after jedi trying to figure
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:14.640]  out if yoda could beat the emperor and it was always like well you're just too good for that
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:21.760]  shit like he he doesn't fight he's he's he's just he's beyond that kind of level like it doesn't
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:28.400]  matter to him he definitely does not pull out a lightsaber and try to cut people in pieces I couldn't
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:31.920]  agree more and I was so proud of what jones and I were talking about because I've been really
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:35.120]  on a star wars kick lady and we were just talking and I was so proud of him he said that
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:38.960]  it jones came up with the same thing that he thought yoda shouldn't have had a lightsaber
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:43.040]  because in the first trilogy the emperor didn't have a lightsaber and wouldn't that be cool
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:47.520]  if like the top dark side guy is so powerful he doesn't need a lightsaber and the top
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:54.080]  light side guy that's that's the kids a more elegant like an elegant what is an elegant weapon
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:56:59.280]  for a more civilized age they don't need weapons they're they're right and then second
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:04.320]  secondarily even if you're gonna say okay he does have a lightsaber he shouldn't fight like a pinball
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:11.200]  miss we're like bouncing around and I see once you're gonna have them try to fight with a lightsaber
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:16.320]  that's really his only viable strategies to be a little cosmating devil whirling dervish because
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:20.880]  otherwise it's like people have to bend down to even like so should I swing at you down there
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:26.160]  somehow he should be so powerful if he does have a lightsaber that it's like it would be like his
[2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:31.520]  his battles would be like that the the first battle between Obi-Wan and very slow very simple
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.640]  and it's like he's just he's one step ahead of me he's just small like you know it's cut
[2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:40.640]  your ankles off I mean like it's a mistake to give him a lightsaber if you do give him one you
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:45.760]  go with the the anime cliche that they also do in samurai movies where it's like two motionless
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:49.840]  people standing facing each other then there's some flash of action and then one guy falls apart
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:54.160]  please he's been sliced in half yeah like that all I wouldn't do it at all yeah you just should
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:59.360]  be okay you said like you know the ember didn't have one you order doesn't need one the and the
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:06.160]  frenetic pace of his lightsaber battling it's just it just reeks to me of like they they were so
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:11.680]  hobbled when he was a practical effect by the limits of puppetry and it's like so hard to make him
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:18.160]  even like walk right and they had like seven puppeteers working Yoda simultaneously so that his
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:23.440]  eyes could move while his mouth moved and it's a fascinating you know backstory of how they made
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:28.080]  that Yoda puppet as realistic as they did and clearly they had trouble making him eat soup
[2:58:28.080 --> 2:58:33.520]  right in the first one and make him believable and then all of a sudden they come to George Lucas
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:39.200]  and they're like well as a computer-generated effect he can do a triple somersault right over Count
[2:58:39.200 --> 2:58:43.120]  Dooku's head I think it was led the other way I think Lucas wanted to see him five with lightsaber
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:48.320]  because yeah I agree I agree as and yeah I yeah I blame George Lucas entirely that it was like
[2:58:48.320 --> 2:58:54.400]  but like these front you know that he saw no beauty in in the economy of the limits of Yoda as a
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:59.520]  practical no it it doesn't or even like the whole the whole philosophy of the force as expressed in
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:04.560]  empire which is Lucas's least favorite movie wait is it really is that is he on record saying that yes
[2:59:04.560 --> 2:59:14.160]  yes good are you surprised no I just hadn't heard that I mean now I mean like I'm I'm I still
[2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:20.320]  hold a good you can Stephen King because he doesn't like the shiny but that is explicable because
[2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:23.840]  it's not that I don't think he doesn't like the shining is that the shining is so different
[2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:28.720]  from the book there's like this is not an adaptation of my book I think my book is good and this
[2:59:28.720 --> 2:59:32.320]  movie is a different movie I think he would admit that the shining is a good movie but he would say
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:37.120]  it's a vaguely no actually he's said that it's a bad movie but because he doesn't think it
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:41.840]  understood he does he's he's a fan of like typical horror movies like he likes darkness he
[2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:45.840]  likes surprises he likes I think he I think he can't expect it's psychological hard to it's
[2:59:45.840 --> 2:59:49.600]  just that it's it is it doesn't capture anything about his book that he feels like there was
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:53.440]  value in my book on this movie captures none of it which is true it captures different value
[2:59:53.440 --> 2:59:57.920]  that is not in the book yeah you know is it well actually it's we know the answer if you guys
[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:03.360]  have ever seen his shining miniseries for ABC which starred the guy from no because I
[3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:10.560]  give us angry at him the guy from the guy from it's you can see what he you can we see we know what's
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:15.200]  Stephen King thinks is a good film I did see I think it's the first one I don't know if
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:19.200]  you know that was good but at least it's faith more faithful to the bookhead well I know he
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:23.520]  and it's like that actually I know he likes it but it wasn't head cemetery movie and that tells me
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:28.480]  everything that I need to know about his it's basically like this Kubrick's The Shining is based
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:32.720]  on the book in the same way that Blade Runner is based on to Android's dream of lecture
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:37.840]  sheet yeah that's basically the connection yeah yeah source and it's good anyway whatever I don't
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:47.040]  want to diverge into that but I do get there anyway yeah so no I'm not I'm not I'm not surprised but
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:53.600]  I asked the press that Lucas dislikes Empire Strikes Back or it's at least if it weren't that
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:00.400]  that bothers my it didn't turn out the way the way like that's the reason he started to
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:04.960]  take over a little bit more control in Jedi and total control in the prequels is that he was
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:09.360]  distracted by you know building his empire and like the success of Star Wars or whatever that he
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:12.480]  basically had outsource and he didn't want a direction of the movie because he was so
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:17.680]  exhausting to Star Wars he should raise the book it's yeah JW Rinsler their huge hard covers one
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.400]  for a new hope one for Empire one for Jedi their beautiful giant hardcover book can also
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:27.520]  go to e-book version and they are long and there's tons of stuff in them about the making of
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:35.920]  all these movies I didn't buy the jet I won I have the first two gotta buy the jet I want to
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:42.160]  have the complete set yeah but at this point I'll probably just do it really cool I mean as ignoring
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:48.480]  as the e-works are that the integration of the stop motion animation of the the scout markers
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:55.040]  into the forest scenes is bananas just shows like the the the the top the highest level the peak
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:01:59.920]  of a bunch of model spaceships oh and so that it was like all going to be CG and so I was like
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:04.640]  this is you know the most money the most experience the people who know how to do it best
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:08.560]  doing the kind of battles that they could have only dreamt of and a new hope and then after that
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:12.000]  it was basically like and no one will ever top that because everything else after that will be
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:16.240]  CG that space fine CG is good but but it's a different kind of space known as ever going to
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:20.800]  that space battle blue my mind like the you see it from the front of the cockpit of the
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:25.600]  the Falcon like just that swarm of firefighters coming at you yeah all right or even just the thing
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:30.000]  where they they you know flip over to go into the little tunnel into the death star like the
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:33.760]  motion control camera moves to you know point of the center of the good and you can both well like
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:37.520]  that they didn't just do the straight forward easiest thing they wanted to which is why it
[3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:42.240]  is great in the the Force Awakens trailer yeah the ridiculous camera moves and tracing the
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:47.360]  the Falcon around that's part of the star the star Wars aesthetic is that unlike for example
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:51.280]  Star Trek where these ships kind of fight like naval things where they had a moving which is cool too
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:54.800]  but it's not the same thing right but it's a whole different thing but in Star Wars it's like
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:03:00.560]  everybody flies fancy like everyone does everything like the hard way it looks cool because it
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:03.920]  looks cool basically there's no other reason like why do you have to spiral and twist around when you
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:08.160]  go into the star why does the camera fall because it looks exciting dramatic and they're like the
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:14.160]  way that Han parks in the ass yeah he flies over his parking spot and then like doesn't
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:20.400]  email him like right down the loop over now yeah he's got style yeah he's got like you just know
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:26.080]  that his signature yeah he does not like casual yeah and and like the fact that you know if you
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:30.000]  think about how the motion control with all these models was done for Jedi that you know everything
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:34.400]  all shot separately whatever the way that space battle was choreographed with the different things
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:39.680]  that happen in it and so that you get coherent action it's just I mean it it's easier to do it in
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:43.280]  CG because you can plan the whole thing out and you put the camera over that you want on the scene
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:48.640]  with models you got to shoot an individual model doing its thing and then know when you put them
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:51.760]  all together it's going to make one coherent scene and if they don't it's not like you can move the
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:56.720]  camera to a different position and try it from here like it's yeah it takes a much more you get it
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:02.400]  you get a sense of spatiality that that it just you could do it you could tell they've got
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:07.120]  wait you know I don't know how to describe it well and the thing is they had you don't realize it
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:12.080]  but you like go if you go back on with the stopwatch and see at how how much time during this space
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:16.400]  battle scene our models on the screen and it's incredibly small a lot of time because it was so
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:20.880]  expensive in time consuming to do spend a lot of time seeing people's faces and cockpits and stuff
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:25.440]  like that and the trick is how do I make a coherent battle scene where I can only show the models
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:31.680]  for a total of like 10% of the of the battle time because it's just so damn expensive and so every
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:36.560]  camera every shot of models has to be like in this scene there's like three storyboards we have to
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:42.800]  see big ship big ship move this way Death Star Fire ship scatter and the message is getting across
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:47.360]  here is the Death Star is active it shot a ship ships are scattered is the lame Falcon this scene
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:52.800]  yes no like and you get like three seconds of screen time to convey an entire movement of this thing
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:56.640]  and then a more a bunch of people's faces and talking and stuff and then you get three more
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:05:00.640]  seconds of ships moving and what happened between that one shot of ships moving the other one
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:05.360]  it's communicated by the people talking by the interior shots by almaq bar yelling or whatever
[3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:09.760]  but it's still all we used together it's good for yeah well we'll do a two-style draw is
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:14.320]  exactly yeah yeah don't show the show you make a do with what you have yeah you make do with
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:19.920]  what you have and you say how do I how do I make this coherent when I know that I can only show
[3:05:19.920 --> 3:05:23.200]  the ships flying around the screen for practically the second you make every one of the second
[3:05:23.200 --> 3:05:27.200]  set versus like you know episode three I don't know which things just flying everywhere all
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:32.640]  time I mean whatever so that brings me to my man I'm basically just using you as my
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:39.280]  Star Wars therapy at this point um the battle at the end of a new hope to take out this has
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:43.840]  Death Star is brilliant you can tell what's happening like the you know the
[3:05:43.840 --> 3:05:48.400]  the rebel ships are now holding pattern somewhere above the Death Star and they keep going on
[3:05:48.400 --> 3:05:54.720]  trends and effectively getting cut down by typhoid so basic it's it's great and there's and there's
[3:05:54.720 --> 3:06:01.120]  a map in the rebel base that shows how close the it is all makes no sense if you think about
[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:04.880]  it for three seconds is like we can go all across the galaxy but the last 10 meters we have to
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:09.200]  do in dramatic but they know whatever let's buy it for artistic license and the same thing with
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:16.560]  like the uh in broad strokes a very large space station which they were not gravitation
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:21.760]  small fighters but whether they weren't careful that you know it wasn't designed for a
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:25.360]  attack for an attack like this and this kind of attack is the only attack the rebels have it's a
[3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:29.200]  typical underdog type story we're gonna attack with a small number of people we're gonna go through
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:33.440]  this little exhaust forward then everyone like it's more or less works in broad strokes but the
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:37.280]  most important thing is like you said once you've established that stuff even if it's
[3:06:37.280 --> 3:06:42.080]  basically nonsensical the idea that there's a trench there's a target we've told you what it is
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:45.520]  we're gonna make a bunch of runs at it and it's gonna look cool because trenchors are cool
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:50.640]  yeah so this is so this is right exactly so this is my argument it's about the battles as portrayed
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:56.880]  in in over the Star Wars movies that battle makes sense granted you know you death star has a
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:02.160]  dumb design then you know did everything that you know stipulate to have it in the john you said
[3:07:03.760 --> 3:07:10.000]  the uh the battle of Hoff makes perfect sense kind of I don't know how jumping out of
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:14.080]  with with the hand waving of like why can't we just bring these things down yeah well as a shield
[3:07:14.080 --> 3:07:18.240]  and like perimeter where we have jumping out of my life far away like whatever but whatever
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:22.240]  yeah I need and eat like why can't why do the walkers have to walk away as why can't they just
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:28.640]  suffice to say they have to walk and that's fine and the rebels are fighting a holding action
[3:07:28.640 --> 3:07:32.080]  they they have no illusion that they're gonna win but they're fighting a holding action
[3:07:32.880 --> 3:07:37.920]  mostly ineffective but they stay in their trench and they start blasting and stuff good um
[3:07:37.920 --> 3:07:44.400]  um the kind of crazy e-walk attack kind of crazy a little bit of the insurgency thing
[3:07:44.400 --> 3:07:47.840]  I think it would work if those guys were just wookies I think that would just work
[3:07:48.560 --> 3:07:51.840]  because you could picture a wookie hitting somebody over the head with a stone and it would
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:57.600]  you know you'd be laid down yeah and like in the way that in the first movie the empire
[3:07:57.600 --> 3:08:02.000]  overlooked the possibility of what are they called snub fighters being something to worry about
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:09.760]  you can say what are they called stun fighters well whatever they call them uh that the empire
[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:15.040]  sort of there's an implicit racism to the empire because everybody in the empire is exactly you
[3:08:15.040 --> 3:08:19.920]  can see them overlooking the force of wookies is being something that like that and and really if
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:25.440]  they had a bigger budget or like more issues like if they had CG basically what they may not
[3:08:25.440 --> 3:08:29.600]  realize and many occupying forces don't realize that you are vastly outnumbered by the new little
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:33.040]  everything and you know that doesn't matter how much technology you have the wookie's being used
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:37.200]  to slaves and then like overthrow that there was way more interesting things you could have done
[3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:42.080]  with that movie anyway they didn't but that said at least that battle makes sense and certainly the
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:49.520]  the space engagement makes a lot of sense because the rebels get totally I mean it's it's a trap
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:54.000]  it's a trap and it works together but you know because they have a plan they execute on their plan
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:58.240]  their plan does not go as planned because the emperor knew about it is a typical you know
[3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:03.520]  they get in any type of war type scenario where you do have a plan for the battle seemed to be
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:07.200]  dramatic you can't simply execute your plan and then win in the end you have to have you know
[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:10.480]  oh things are going badly we thought this was going to be our plan but it turns out the sara's
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:15.520]  active and oh here's the entire empire's fleet and we have a series probably a trap between
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:22.480]  the imperial fleet and and entirely up for a rational guest star not a good place to be all of
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:29.760]  these battlefields but let's go to the totally well I would say this before we go to the prequels
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:34.960]  let me say this that in the first trilogy let's say it takes place over roughly six years which is
[3:09:34.960 --> 3:09:38.720]  what the movies took place you know in real life to make them takes place over six years
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:44.640]  the the three movies spend an inordinate number most of their time on the most interesting things
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:50.080]  that happened in the whole galaxy in those six years the space battles that took place were
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:56.320]  monumentally important like historically and the personal scenes are about the most important
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:03.040]  people in the galaxy at that time right now go to the original trilogy which takes place over
[3:10:03.040 --> 3:10:11.040]  like more more than six years what is it yeah it's like 20 something what the well
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:19.600]  oh like it's like seven and then he's like 10 years 10 years yeah maybe a little hint of 15 at the
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:25.920]  beginning of it there's a gap there's a galactic senate and there's a jedi order that seems to
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:31.120]  order you know number in like the thousands and by the end of it the entire jedi order is wiped
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:39.040]  out and the republic has replaced my empire they spend like a grand total of like two and a half
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:44.880]  minutes on screen showing the jedi order being wiped out and you know the empire just says he's
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:50.640]  the emperor so they they just the most interesting things that you would think they would show
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:53.840]  over the trilogy they'd cover in about two and a half minutes because they don't know what they're
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:11:03.040]  doing so okay the battle in fanta minis one uh the the gunghins the gunghins
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:08.880]  destroyed boring because you're fighting on a flat plane but whatever you got the shields and it's kind
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:17.040]  of cool in a weird vermin phalanx kind of way until whatever until it falls apart and jode
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:22.080]  juncture the slaps yeah exactly it turns into the throwing big glowy purple balls that
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:26.000]  yeah like it starts out kind of cool when they start deploying the army it's like out in the
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:31.040]  white flight in the field given this kind of level attack and or whatever they're fighting on the
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:36.800]  window like speed right exactly exactly and that and that you know the idea that they're fighting
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:41.680]  droids that you know if their control ship goes off their head spot it doesn't make sense
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:48.240]  so the space battle is inane completely inane they're going after what the control ship and it's
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:57.600]  stupid and and it gets lucky like he doesn't even get smart he just it's horrible uh so that can't
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:02.320]  touch and even it can't even touch the ewok battle like it's it's night and day worse than that
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:06.800]  you care more about the ewoks angel but any of the gunghins or anything of course you do
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:10.400]  yeah the ewoks you've been touching moment with a guy in the glide to get shot down and the other
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:15.520]  ewoks like and you just establish them as characters of like capturing them and bringing them back
[3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:20.320]  and discussing them being convinced by you know c3po that he's a god until i didn't go and i think
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:25.360]  it works in their favor that you can't understand what they're saying because yeah well and there
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:29.200]  is the one guy who got he there's like an explosion that goes off in the one ewok
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:34.320]  yeah and the grub he rubs the other one a little modern i mean they look that's a little
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:39.760]  yeah yeah it's getting it's getting it but but at least at least at least there's some sense
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:43.680]  that there are serious mistakes yeah and you killed one of the cutest things on screen that's
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:51.200]  you know that's something um in the second one we have the inane yeah we have the
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:55.760]  contains beginning of the Clone Wars whatever i don't even want to talk about that because not
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:01.600]  it makes sense uh what they they how did all those jettas just walk in there i don't know who knows
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:10.960]  why would you i'm not a really tactical savvy guy but if i was 500 jettas i would not walk
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:16.080]  into the middle of an arena where everything can just shoot me it's like they so wanted to have
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:21.360]  a you know roman colosseum good guys versus the lion's type of thing yeah it's alien land it's an
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:26.800]  exciting you just have it in this big stadium and yeah like the only the only cool thing about
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:33.280]  that is that uh Vietnam era uh helicopter gunship coming in with all the storm but the clone troopers
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:40.480]  basically shooting all the bad guys and kind of trying to like trying to extract some of my battles
[3:13:40.480 --> 3:13:44.560]  that that's the only thing the same problem as the first battles is like i don't care about
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:49.520]  either side of these battles like i vaguely know that the good guys are the guy with yoda and
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:53.200]  i know they want to do like the well the good guys using stormtroopers isn't that weird but
[3:13:53.840 --> 3:13:59.280]  you don't care it's just a bunch of things it's like uh what do you call it man of snow
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:04.320]  just people banging against each other but it's more than that it's more than that they get
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:11.840]  tactically stupider as the movies go on so as soon as they dust off they land and the jettas
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:17.280]  end up taking squads of stormtroopers and the stormtroopers that the clone troopers are
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:23.920]  a finite resource they've been cloned over what ten years against an advancing joydarmy
[3:14:24.960 --> 3:14:31.360]  and what do they do they just run at them they just run at them like flat out run at a bunch
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:39.040]  of robots that we've seen a factory pumping them out by the hundreds like it's it's it's the
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:45.520]  dumbest thing it it's well this is a George Lucasism in the entire movies the idea and everybody
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:51.360]  succumbs this especially older people but the idea that the well i'm not everybody i mean
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:56.320]  James Cameron has the idea that the droid army is obviously going to be inferior to even clones
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:59.600]  because living things are so much smarter than droids and droids yeah but living things are smart
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:04.400]  because they will duck and take cover and shoot at the dumbass robots but those ideas like
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:08.320]  there's so many droids in the droid armies it even the gunkkins can defeat them and when it's the
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:11.760]  clones versus the droids even though there's a factory turning them out obviously the living
[3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:15.840]  things that are going to win and i think they much more likely and reasonable scenarios the term
[3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:19.760]  air one is like no the machines win because they really go to kill yes that that would be my it
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:23.760]  it's like at least take cover that's why the living thing wins because it's got a sense of self
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:31.040]  preservation effectively and here's where we get to where i want to just murder if you work
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:39.280]  here see well i don't see a lot so that's okay umm yoda is on kashik the the working
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:46.160]  homeworld in the third movie and the droid army is coming and for whatever reason the
[3:15:46.160 --> 3:15:54.400]  droid army has decided to cross a lake or river or whatever it is and land on a beach and the
[3:15:54.400 --> 3:16:00.560]  beach is covered on two sides by elevated cliffs and on the top of the cliffs are a bunch of clones
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:08.880]  with machine guns or whatever the hell it is like blasters and on a trench on the beach are
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:15.440]  a whole bunch of wokies with all of their bowcasters and their badass stuff and then the droids
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:21.520]  start coming and as they get onto the beach the wokies in the trench what do you think they do
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:29.920]  they jump up out of the trench and run at the wokies in the water and run at the droids in the water
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:37.760]  you're in a trench shoot the robots don't why would you jump out of the trench why it's it's it's horrible
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:45.680]  it's like it is like it's it's the most revolting that not revolting but it's like we're gone
[3:16:45.680 --> 3:16:51.040]  we've gone from a completely understandable really complicated scenario of assaulting a death star
[3:16:51.040 --> 3:16:56.400]  with multiple fighter squadrons into such a simple scenario where it's like these living things
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:00.640]  should probably not jump out of cover why would why did you bother building the trench
[3:17:02.080 --> 3:17:07.280]  I've often said about like the Roger Mori or Bond movies that he he gets you know like when he
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:12.240]  gets captured and is you know facing seeming certain death he doesn't even seem perturbed he's
[3:17:12.240 --> 3:17:17.440]  not worried he's not sweaty and he it's like he acts as though he's a character who's read the
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:22.000]  rest of the script and knows he's getting out of it like it's like the wokies knew like well we
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:26.320]  read that we don't get shot so we'll just make sense it's it's so they didn't have they didn't have
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:30.400]  good analogues for the because the other analog the movie at analogues are you World War 2 dog fights
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:34.320]  yeah or like you just said it's Star Trek you had naval troops right so you have that Sam
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:39.120]  samurai sword fights you have analogues right and so the analog obvious analog for infantry this
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:42.800]  plenty of analogs for them depending on what you want to do they just chose not to do any of them
[3:17:42.800 --> 3:17:46.560]  so one analog is like the Lord of the Rings thing where you can do a medieval right formation
[3:17:46.560 --> 3:17:52.400]  type of you know they're the kind of did in the captain of all of all the Lord of the Ring movies including
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:56.160]  the Hobbit ones and everything like they did a reasonable job of saying here is something that
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:18:00.240]  looks vaguely like a maneuver that might have been done by large standing armies with a medieval
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:05.680]  weapons whatever they may be protective patterns for shields the use of your your your bowman
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:10.000]  and the use of cavalry and mounted things stuff like that and there's plenty of analogs to choose
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:15.120]  from Star Wars one like they do have trenches like they were doing that you know they did it on
[3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:19.120]  the housing it's just that they are like at a certain point they're like okay here's a set up but
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:26.720]  rather than trying to sort of model footage from similar large infantry battles we'll just do whatever
[3:18:26.720 --> 3:18:32.800]  seems the most dramatic and will he's leaping from the barricades seems it's it's bananas it
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:37.200]  but my complaint with that is that I didn't know who in those well yeah I didn't care whether
[3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:40.880]  they won I didn't care about it like I don't care about anything that's going on there it's just
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:45.520]  well that's it I think more I have more investment in the video game I think yes exactly I think
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:50.800]  you might have had they acted in any kind of way that made any kind of sense at all I think
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:59.360]  there's probably characters or at least I was going about to say NPC's but whatever extras in
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:05.920]  Empire Strikes Back that you are more interested in than any of those workings the like you know
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.480]  that the guy that pushes the more controlled button that fires that that cannon at the the added leg
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:17.520]  in Empire Strikes Back yeah but that was yeah but let's see the thing is that was a battle that
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:22.000]  was happening around our heroes who we care about this thing that the prequels do that they
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:27.760]  added the end of Jedi as well it's pointless to survey a survey of conflicts happening across the
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:32.480]  galaxy not involving anybody you care about that's like they needed to express the idea of we've
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:36.800]  given this order and everywhere and every planet any Jedi out there are being killed and so it's
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:40.640]  like a survey of like on this planet these people are fighting on this planet these people are
[3:19:40.640 --> 3:19:44.400]  fighting yeah this planet and that does not make a movie that doesn't even make a good documentary
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:50.320]  can burn like you have to you have to have investment in the conflict and you can briefly
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:53.680]  show that maybe something else is going on elsewhere like they do this in disaster movies like in
[3:19:53.680 --> 3:19:58.800]  the beginning they show that the the crumbling of civilization but that's just like a brief
[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:03.760]  aside to the main story it can't be the your climax can't be a survey of battles happening
[3:20:03.760 --> 3:20:07.760]  other planets to suffice it to say the good guys the bad guys are fighting people everywhere
[3:20:07.760 --> 3:20:12.000]  and we will tell through music cues or whatever which side is winning I don't care is anybody
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:17.600]  here that I care about where are my heroes do I care what anybody's movies like imagine if the
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:24.240]  first and only time we meet sunny and the godfather is two minutes before he it rationally leaves
[3:20:24.240 --> 3:20:28.160]  and you know goes through the toll they would just show all the deaths they wouldn't show the
[3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:32.400]  movie for and every like you guys killed that guy that guy killed in a revolving door this guy
[3:20:32.400 --> 3:20:37.840]  got killed at a toll booth it's like yeah we we care about sunny and the toll booth because we've
[3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:45.280]  seen him in two hours and we've seen him before act out of bad temper and you know we don't want
[3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:49.600]  to be he's kind of a bad guy but we still kind of like him you know and it's you know it's like
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:20:53.760]  the culmination of the Eagles plan is all the people dying it's because we realize it's the
[3:20:53.760 --> 3:20:58.320]  culmination of plan we know who those people are we you know and we understand how he is
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:02.640]  coordinated all this to happen when he is he is in some place that is essentially untouchable while
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:09.280]  it's going on and by the time he gets out it's all settled right he spent the entire three movies
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:14.640]  showing the wrong stuff and developing the wrong stuff and then just rushed through with and
[3:21:14.640 --> 3:21:19.520]  therefore with no emotional impact whatsoever these characters who should have been developed we had
[3:21:19.520 --> 3:21:25.600]  three whole movies where they could have developed I let's just say six Jedi six different Jedi
[3:21:25.600 --> 3:21:31.760]  who in a course of three movies could have been made into real characters with varying flaws
[3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:36.320]  and personalities and then they die at the end or you just show like even if you did that or you
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:40.400]  just show whatever is happening to the characters that we supposedly care about and have them
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:47.360]  have them established to be I care about the Jedi and have them here that the Jedi are dying elsewhere
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:51.040]  you don't need to show them because if they don't care about them like you can have heroes and
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:55.440]  situations where they find out that bad things are happening elsewhere but you don't need to show
[3:21:55.440 --> 3:21:58.480]  the bad things that's happening else you can just show that my main characters care about this
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:02.080]  therefore I care about it but it's not so important so how do we how do we feel about the
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:06.080]  execution of order 66 because I thought that was actually one of the most effective
[3:22:07.680 --> 3:22:10.080]  I you know I feel like there should have been a musical
[3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:21.520]  yeah like what do they call them make it like it's not a segue like a motif yeah I keep
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:24.960]  thinking about goodfellas when when he's trying to get the cocaine all sort of that
[3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:33.040]  you can you could sell any of that like but you have to have you can if you have a better
[3:22:33.040 --> 3:22:38.800]  movie leading up to it how you communicate that a coordinated attack is taking place with
[3:22:38.800 --> 3:22:42.160]  essentially you know brainwashed clones who were always you know it's like the
[3:22:42.160 --> 3:22:45.280]  mensherian candidate like oh trigger this and they all just do this order they all
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:50.960]  know this order and the order comes they kill all the Jedi fine you can you can do that in
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:22:56.320]  lots of different ways but you need to show the people who care about that we care about these
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:22:59.520]  people and these people care that all the Jedi are killed and that's what you need to vote
[3:22:59.520 --> 3:23:06.800]  but it did kind of work it was it was hamfisted but we had seen many of those Jedi do stuff
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:11.680]  or at least being in the background right yeah they have many lines they sat around a table they
[3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:15.520]  smiled they they helped out in some other movies and now they're now they're getting gunned down
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:22.960]  they played sad music but it's just like yeah it's something good you can't do it at that point
[3:23:22.960 --> 3:23:28.960]  you either earned it or you haven't and they did yeah yeah which which brings us to the end of
[3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:32.800]  of that movie and it's the whole end of the whole trilogy and it's the whole reason that the
[3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:39.680]  prequel trilogy was even made which was to set up the middle trilogy which was already established
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:45.280]  and it had to therefore had to leave us in a certain place and had to explain certain things
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:49.840]  the whole point of it this is the whole point this is the only reason that the prequel trilogy
[3:23:49.840 --> 3:23:57.120]  was even made or written and it makes no god damn sense whatsoever so let's just say let's just give
[3:23:57.120 --> 3:24:04.320]  it up that all the most of the Jedi have been extinguished their dead exit order 66 killed them
[3:24:04.320 --> 3:24:11.360]  but Obi-Wan and Yoda are still together well yeah and and they figure out what's gone on they
[3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:19.760]  know who the emperor is so why in the world would they split up why wouldn't they either A
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:26.720]  go get go after I would I would suggest that the first thing they should do is go after
[3:24:26.720 --> 3:24:32.160]  Anakin together well first of all I think maybe they think Anakin's data that point or at least a
[3:24:32.160 --> 3:24:38.800]  non-factor no they decide Yoda's oh sorry oh before Obi-Wan's gonna go I thought you meant after
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:44.240]  like at the end when they when they rendezvous on what they come said no that doesn't make any sense
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:49.120]  either but before that when they decide who to fight if they decide we should get the emperor first
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:54.080]  they should go together if they decide we should go take care of Anakin either see if we can turn
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  them back to the good side or do something with them why in the world would they split
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:07.120]  it makes no sense whatsoever no the only conceivable rationale for that is that if you
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:13.600]  act swiftly and by surprise and take out both of them maybe that counts or something but no I
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:19.360]  would just go I would take your to go talk to you Anakin like to see it's if you have to
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:25.920]  if you have to kill him you ought to do it you know like I'd even while I I mean can
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:31.440]  oh even says on stage on stage on on screen that uh he can't kill him and then you're
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:37.200]  to says no go do it why would you why would you assign that like he's already basically said
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:44.640]  but it's not gonna but then even given that the asinine nature of their let's split up
[3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:49.040]  even though there's only two of us left and you know right now we have that we could have the
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:52.880]  element of surprise and go if there's any chance that one of us could be at the emperor surely
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:57.760]  we have a better chance together we could do it right now even if you take that just let him do
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:04.720]  that and say Yoda fights the emperor and Obi-Wan fights Vader and things he kills him even then
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:11.760]  afterwards you find out well Obi-Wan did almost kill Vader and and and like left him deformed
[3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:17.520]  and semi crippled and Yoda at least fought the emperor to a standstill kind of and then they
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:22.720]  decide well well now we'll just now we'll just spend 20 years it seems like they could have
[3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:28.320]  teamed up and taken out the emperor at that point right like Yoda did like pretty close to taking him
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:34.960]  out as best as since their plan wasn't okay you go take Luke to Tatooine hide him from the
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:37.920]  emperor and slowly train him as a Jedi that wasn't there playing either because it was like
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:42.080]  you go hide in Tatooine google be there keep your eye on them but don't try to actually train
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:47.440]  them up right like what are they waiting for what was there what was their plan for victory right
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:52.640]  at the moment that they split up and went into hiding they both had fought they wanted defeated
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:59.280]  the other and Obi-Wan had soundly defeated Vader and Yoda had fought the emperor to a standstill
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:03.280]  I would say and certainly I would say given that he fought him to an almost standstill if they
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:09.200]  went after him together Obi-Wan and Yoda you you know I like their chances say like in
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:14.800]  by the time a new hope comes in an empire what what those movies say is that Yoda had checked
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:21.120]  out he had a colossal failure institutional failure to deal with the whole you know he he was
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:25.840]  he failed and his he thought he could you know be the head of the light side and you know so he's
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:30.800]  basically not an exile but he's like he's given up and he's gone off to live in the woods right
[3:27:30.800 --> 3:27:35.280]  so he's checked out right and Obi-Wan same thing he's crazy old man who lives out in the
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:40.080]  both of them are like we are defeated this is our great shame the best Obi-Wan can do is to make
[3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:44.880]  sure Luke continues to hide from the emperor hoping ever as exhibits any force powers keep him
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:49.360]  down on the farm and then at the very least he can say at least I'm keeping these kids safe but the
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:53.760]  empire is one we are defeated we have no plan for victory but like you said at the end of stupid
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:28:00.000]  episode three they're not in that headspace they're not both so massively defeated and so crushed
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:04.240]  by their own personal failings that they check out entirely from the conflict and say well this
[3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:09.360]  is never going to change it's going to go off somewhere hide and die right exactly exactly I
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:14.080]  had I just assumed even as I was suffering through those prequel village I was like something's
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:20.240]  going to happen at the end of this that's going to leave Obi-Wan and Yoda both like morally defeated
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:26.480]  and instead they both left like oh my god we were so close not not only so close like if you were
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:29.440]  going to kill a heck and he was right there you could have killed them right it's not like you
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:33.440]  didn't know he was still alive it just assume he would die it's like a game of the bond villain it's
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:36.240]  like well I'll just assume this machinery will kill you mr. Bond I'm gonna leave the room now
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:43.040]  yeah when I see you later the movie I'll be genuinely surprised I do I do kind of understand the
[3:28:43.040 --> 3:28:46.880]  notion of not wanting to murder Anakin and co-blood which is effectively what it would would have
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:52.160]  been but then you say well exactly you either say yeah or once you catch his fire maybe you
[3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:55.840]  walk back down then a bank man and just it was more than the carol you think it's like I'm not
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:29:00.240]  going to kill you but if you happen to slide in that lava a little farther yeah that's horrible
[3:29:00.240 --> 3:29:08.080]  it's what it is just awful no I mean no wonder he ends up extra pissed off yeah and I hated that
[3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:15.280]  fight between Yoda and the emperor that was awful that was just awesome yeah I liked when Yoda
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:20.640]  walked in and just just totally destroyed the two imperial guards the emperor is a
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:26.160]  emperor is a fun guy to watch fight because he's kind of ugly and he was fine he was fine when
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:31.440]  the four jedi showed up when the jedi showed up to reverse him I was fine with that because I
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:37.120]  liked the fact that he actually would I could see him using a lightsaber because well a a
[3:29:37.120 --> 3:29:43.120]  his light so it's not that obscure but I also like the notion that he's just hasn't quite
[3:29:43.120 --> 3:29:48.160]  reached that level of enlightenment yet that he doesn't need one Yoda always strikes me as somebody
[3:29:48.160 --> 3:29:53.760]  who's just well before these like the emperor seemed kind of like the emperor seemed kind of
[3:29:53.760 --> 3:29:58.160]  feral exactly when the emperor and Yoda were fighting and Yoda was like using the force to move
[3:29:58.160 --> 3:30:03.040]  heavy things and the emperor was you know shooting at him fighting or whatever yeah well yeah
[3:30:03.040 --> 3:30:08.400]  uh although the lightning I ultimately screws him up doesn't he he he gets he gets thrown off
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:14.800]  and then his little nails gets stuck into the that's a good question I've never seen a good
[3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:18.480]  Jonas and I have talked about that a lot so that we didn't ever even mention makes window
[3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:23.840]  who who to me I love Sam Jackson a waste of Sam exactly yeah oh waste that's a much of what a waste
[3:30:23.840 --> 3:30:29.200]  of him yeah what a waste because he's awesome and you could have been a bad guy we got a real
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:34.000]  some kind of weird going in jedi he's awesome and he's also in he's also into star wars he wanted
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:37.920]  to be in the movies and what he was given is like he does the bad job at the line rings he has
[3:30:37.920 --> 3:30:42.240]  no charisma to the character has nothing to do he doesn't seem like a badass it's just like how
[3:30:42.240 --> 3:30:47.120]  can Sam Jackson not seem like a badass well he seems more badass than anybody else if only because
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:52.400]  everybody else is completely wouldn't so there is a cool thing in that scene where they go to
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:57.920]  confront the emperor and the emperor just jumps at them with a weird fighting style like you
[3:30:57.920 --> 3:31:03.520]  said ferrule is perfect and I love the way that he like killed for them in like 10 seconds
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:07.840]  like he's so badass and there's never been a lightsaber fight like that every other lightsaber fight
[3:31:07.840 --> 3:31:13.600]  we've ever seen up until this point was dramatic and had ebbs and flows and even like when duku in
[3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:19.040]  the second movie was kind of dominant over Obi-Wan and Anakin it took him a while took him a while
[3:31:19.040 --> 3:31:23.440]  to cut off Anakin's hand it took him a while to get Obi-Wan you know pinned under a column
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:29.600]  whereas the emperor is such a badass boom boom boom boom yeah I mean they they light down
[3:31:29.600 --> 3:31:33.600]  another one and then on the floor like that's his so this is the thing about the fight scenes and
[3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:38.160]  all these movies if you're going to have a fight scene unless your movie is about fighting styles
[3:31:38.160 --> 3:31:41.440]  unless it's like a while it's classic kung fu movies for the whole friggin movie is about
[3:31:41.440 --> 3:31:44.880]  i'm going to learn crane technique and i'm going to learn the tiger technique and my technique is
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:48.080]  better than your technique and i'm going to train it a monastery like unless your whole friggin
[3:31:48.080 --> 3:31:52.960]  movie is about fighting techniques the fight can't be about who is a better fighter the fight
[3:31:52.960 --> 3:31:57.520]  has to be about something else in the case of the the emperor going far all the way the part of
[3:31:57.520 --> 3:32:01.600]  that fight that was dramatic is the emperor is revealed he's revealed in a sudden fashion that
[3:32:01.600 --> 3:32:05.760]  people who are there are surprise that he's revealed it is not about how exactly he defeats
[3:32:05.760 --> 3:32:10.400]  those people when you have ember versus yoda it's not about who is stronger and who is not the fight
[3:32:10.400 --> 3:32:14.400]  always has to be about something else because and again unless your movie is a kung fu movie where
[3:32:14.400 --> 3:32:18.880]  you're actually concentrating on fighting styles you always have to have the fight be about something
[3:32:18.880 --> 3:32:23.120]  else from the fight because that's what happens we're not we're not like otherwise you just have
[3:32:23.120 --> 3:32:26.080]  a movie where people have a conflict and then they just have a longer and out sword fight in the
[3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:30.000]  winner of the sword fight wins the movie that can't be what the fight is about the fight has to
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:34.240]  be about something else and they just have to happen to be fighting to work out whatever else it
[3:32:34.240 --> 3:32:37.280]  doesn't mean they need to have a conversation the whole time in the fight princess brides style or
[3:32:37.280 --> 3:32:42.400]  anything but like they do the fight has to be about some of the emperor killing all those people
[3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:47.280]  the fight that that particular fight is about I am revealed this is me I bet you're surprised
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:51.120]  this is all guy can do this and here I am and quickly kill them and one and once that is done
[3:32:51.120 --> 3:32:55.520]  the fight is well so here's the thing with that I mean I totally agree with you and I think that
[3:32:55.520 --> 3:33:01.600]  goes back to the point I was trying to make about the battles is that you know without anything
[3:33:01.600 --> 3:33:07.680]  any skin in the game it just really doesn't matter um really the only character that showed up to
[3:33:07.680 --> 3:33:14.480]  arrest uh Palpatine was windy the other guys were just fodder to prove that like whoa this got
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:22.240]  serious and you know sure enough he dispatched them and and you know it like popcorn they didn't
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:26.720]  they didn't matter the the actual fight came down to windy and and and Palpatine and I thought it
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:32.000]  was actually pretty good fight I did too I actually think it was the only bike them the best part of
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:37.360]  the whole because I think they both had something at stake it certainly windy represented uh
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:43.520]  the old school uh strict jedi order and and Palpatine was that you know I was still in the
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:50.240]  Yoda Palpatine fight because it you know my interpretation of the way that scene went was that
[3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:56.320]  Mace Windu is indeed a badass maybe he's even more powerful than Yoda because he's at least at the
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:02.640]  there is a line sort fighting uh I think Anakin delivers it's something like I will be a I want to
[3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:10.000]  be a better sword fighter than Mace Windu than master windu something like or maybe they definitely
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:15.840]  shout out to to Windu to be like Yoda was always held in whatever the conversation was always
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:24.240]  held up yeah they do it yeah there is one that shout out that that uh sort of props
[3:34:24.240 --> 3:34:29.920]  Windu up as being a badass and I forget what it is yeah but like but but Sam Jackson the actor
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:33.520]  could not deliver no no because I guess they don't have enough body doubles forever and he just
[3:34:33.520 --> 3:34:39.440]  look kind of old and tired I like the way move well I kind of like that because I I kind of like
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:44.080]  the idea that I mean he hasn't really been well actually we just saw him fighting the second one
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:49.760]  I was I was gonna say I thought it was a touch like he yeah I don't know I liked it because it was
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:54.880]  less frenetic and you could just sort of see them battling yeah Palpatine was seeing my interpretation
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:35:00.640]  yeah yeah well my interpretation of the scene though is that Windu actually actually got the
[3:35:00.640 --> 3:35:07.680]  better of him and that emperor if Palpatine was not sandbagging he was desperate and at the only way
[3:35:07.680 --> 3:35:13.360]  he could save himself the only way was if he could completely if he could complete Anakin's turn to
[3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:20.800]  the dark side it either he could turn Anakin and have Anakin you know knock Windu out the window or
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:26.480]  cut off his arm or whatever he did first or he was dead Palpatine was a loser his only chance had
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:31.600]  nothing he couldn't beat Mace Windu in the fight he'd lost so the only way he could win was to
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:37.440]  complete Anakin's turn that was what I mean I think Windu didn't fair to me it's a failure of the
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:41.920]  filmmaking that it's not clear that those were the stakes yeah and I always thought he was sandbagging
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:46.480]  a little bit just because that's kind of his M.O. where he was like you know it's hard to say I
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:51.760]  even would be like Anakin that's my take but I have to admit that the other take that he was sandbagging
[3:35:51.760 --> 3:35:57.760]  and he could have up the force on Windu at any moment you know yeah but it's a slightly filmmaking
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:36:03.040]  for that to be ambiguous it's probably not intended to be ambiguous it's like but and in my reading it
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:08.640]  was him when he was shooting the force lightning at Windu and Windu was successfully blocking it with
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:15.440]  his lightsaber it and his that's when he got deformed and you know that was him like depleting his
[3:36:15.440 --> 3:36:19.840]  own life force like he I don't think he wanted to be disfigured it wasn't like it was his true
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:26.480]  form he's not a shape shifter he was like wrecking himself because he was so desperate you know
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:31.360]  he was giving it everything he had and even everything he had wasn't enough to beat Mace Windu
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:37.920]  that's my take too if only because again he deforms himself but I'd really do think that it's just
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:43.840]  it's just a condemnation of the filmmaking that it's ambiguous because this at the same level when
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:49.120]  you know the the culmination in Return of the Jedi it's all very clear what the stakes are
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:53.360]  Emperor so there's Emperor couldn't beat Mace Windu in one-on-one comedy also couldn't beat Yoda
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:58.480]  like it best you could say both of them came to draws or maybe Mace at the upper hand but
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:04.640]  that doesn't make sense in the context of the later movies the idea that the Emperor is the top
[3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:09.840]  of the heap on the dark side and you would assume that one-on-one the Emperor could take out
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:15.440]  any of the single light side people simply because the dark side you know not more powerful but
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:21.120]  like in terms of killing people like you know how do you get to be the head of the city well we
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:25.520]  also don't know how especially could be like a Peter Pan thing where every time you believe in a
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:31.200]  Sith guy he gets more powerful you know like yeah I don't know like it is basically the question
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:35.360]  is is the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi more powerful than the Emperor and episodes right
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:40.880]  and who knows also who cares because yeah I would say yes I think so too just because it's like
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:45.280]  it's like a the Sith get like more powerful as they get old than more evil yeah because I mean he's had
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:51.200]  20 years to get rid of it being a badass right or maybe not with his lightsaber but at least with
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:58.000]  his you know his research into being evil well no because I mean he you know they talk about that
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:03.200]  at the opera that's a great scene by the way well great it's it's it's really it's as good as given
[3:38:03.200 --> 3:38:09.040]  it it's nonsensical though it's as how are you manipulating him oh there was a dude who could stop
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:12.800]  people from dying did you ever care about somebody maybe you should slaughter children but it's
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:18.400]  it's it's tense it's an opera which I thought was kind of interesting I like to stop going on
[3:38:18.400 --> 3:38:24.800]  he artistically yes yeah but like and the actor what's his name he's pretty he's good he's
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:29.200]  maybe he's one of the better actors in the prequel trilogy who despite the fact that he's given
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:36.480]  stupid things to say deliver yeah I've agreed saying great in the you know in the toilet bowl
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:41.920]  in which it swims it's actually a pretty it's a it's pretty good isn't it great isn't it so
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:48.960]  telling though that like in the first trilogy the original trilogy everybody was at least
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:54.400]  clamoring for these backstory prequels of well how did Vader get like this how did Anakin
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:39:00.640]  turn to the dark side whereas after the prequels nobody was like well how did the emperor
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:04.880]  learn to be a sith while he was an up and not just a thing where you mentioned like in a new hope
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:10.000]  where like they offhandedly mentioned sorts of lots of things like clone war or empire or mandel
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:14.080]  or the you know all these things like they laid these little seeds it's like oh you could flesh
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.080]  those out forward or backwards what seeds were laid in the prequels it's like the time began in the
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:22.080]  prequels like there was nothing mentioned in the prequels well there was just about things that have
[3:39:22.080 --> 3:39:28.480]  there was a real death shittiest what was the name the uh the pv's guy death mass like they played
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:35.200]  against the right but like but those are that's not that's actually spoken in the thing it's not like
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:40.400]  you know something catcher it was like a major plot point where they're describing a backstory
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:45.040]  right like the one and only thing I could think of that I'd kind of wanted to know more about was
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:49.280]  this I have no idea how to thank you for being that up because that none of it makes it's right
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:56.480]  he's I he was a Jedi who somehow commissioned a building of what's he killed and why duke and then
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:01.520]  duke who posed his hands just too much exposition for like there's just too much plot happening or
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:06.160]  like the structure isn't sturdy and then they hang tinsles and armaments all over the friggin
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:09.600]  thing until it's just a big giant mess and it's like you didn't even have good bone structure
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:15.280]  under there now now you just like a clone army if I don't know how many strong it's got to be
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:22.320]  hundreds of thousands right from what we see just appears and the galactic republic is like oh cool
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:30.080]  let's just use these guys what make that's mind block boggling like clones aren't humans that's
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:33.840]  doesn't matter about the clones it doesn't matter even in even in a car brawl too it's like that
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:40.160]  many it's like showed up to be on your site it's not a matter of what they are it's worse than
[3:40:40.160 --> 3:40:44.000]  that it's it's like saying if you wanted to have a standing army made entirely identical twins that
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:48.080]  we'd be okay if they're all done slower because they're all genetic well they're yeah so it's fine
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:52.480]  once you're genetically identical it's like well they're so bad as they don't even count you don't
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:58.000]  even count as human if anybody shares their genes you don't count as human but even a guy like
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:05.360]  duke who has in broad stroke sounds like an interesting guy was a real Jedi turned to the dark side
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:08.400]  left the order which you know what they make they make quick sound like no big deal
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:13.920]  oh he's an extra right possibly do that so that makes me think that extra eyes are a thing
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:21.760]  yeah that's you know some guys leave and get whatever they do yeah and to yeah go into professional
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:27.920]  sports or something that's still good guys but you know yeah in broad strokes if you just defined
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:32.160]  the character before you showed me the movie I would think oh that's an interesting guy I would
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:36.240]  like to know more about him then you watch the movie and you're like I would I am not interested
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:43.600]  in the least bit in this broad caricature of evil well I have something for you and you know
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:52.640]  he's a robot with four arms and eight light sabers how much how much less did you care about
[3:41:52.640 --> 3:41:58.960]  something besides I mean well I like the idea of taking lightsabers from here I like and you
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:04.800]  don't want he worked well in that in that cell animation one that we were talking about at the top
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:11.840]  of the show I like that character hmm and then I saw him in in film and he's he's stinks
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.080]  he's awful it's just yeah he was just empty he was just empty bad guy and they even
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:25.040]  rears the the idea of having a respiratory problem from Vader you know it's just
[3:42:25.040 --> 3:42:30.080]  not I do like the way he's dispatched by the movie with a blaster because you get a cute
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:37.360]  you get a cute action here a line out of it yeah that wasn't good but it you know wasn't bad
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:45.360]  yeah no well and it raises the question of how many how many one on one duels can you
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:51.200]  throw in one movie I mean because that's really what that last movie devolved into is just one
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:43:00.800]  after it was pretty hilarious that um Grievous just starts shit talking Kenobi despite the fact
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:04.880]  that any keeps could doing it despite the fact that Kenobi chopped off to his arms ready
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:09.520]  and he's still he's still giving like you can escape it's like I've just started cutting
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:15.200]  into pieces I'm pretty sure I'm doing pretty good here like he jumps into like a ring of a
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:20.880]  hundred droids and then just you know chops up the bad guy and the bad guy still giving him shit
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:26.960]  like you know maybe turn that back a little bit so there's there's Darth Maul there's Count
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:32.480]  Duke who there's Grievous and even the emperor himself you've got four major bad guys in a
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:36.880]  whole trilogy and there's one of them who I would like to know more about you know or how he came
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:48.160]  to be who he is no you can combine them all into a jack or fit maybe yeah maybe maybe but I still
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:53.120]  think it's kind of it's that they just re duplicated at least he meets a better end in his son
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:44:00.800]  yeah yeah all right I think we've gone on long enough this has been everything I could ask for
[3:44:00.800 --> 3:44:08.240]  more it's a true holiday spectacular um yeah oh man our sponsors we've got get marker one
