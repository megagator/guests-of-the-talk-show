[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  Jim, how was your Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving was good, John. It was quiet, had a bit of gravy and
[00:06.240 --> 00:11.600]  mashed potatoes. Is the global supply chain issues, are they affecting the flow of Heineken
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.960]  to the West Coast? You know what, I've had a steady flow. We put in orders online and picked
[00:18.960 --> 00:26.080]  them up. The tanker truck can't sit by my house anymore because, you know, there is a shortage, so...
[00:26.080 --> 00:34.240]  Can I tell you, shopping in like, you know, we live right in the city so we just walk everywhere
[00:34.240 --> 00:39.920]  and in most of the whole pandemic I would just walk places and take my mask and not a lot of car
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.880]  shopping. We used the car less than ever over the last two years but I don't know why that is because
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.720]  in theory you'd think we might use it just as much but we were out in the suburbs visiting family
[00:49.440 --> 00:55.040]  and my wife dialed up an order at Target but you could go to the suburbs. Have you ever done this
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.320]  where you can just have it curbside delivered? You pay for it like Apple Pay or something,
[01:00.320 --> 01:06.000]  you know, on the phone and you just tell them your license plate number, you pull into a special
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.320]  parking spot, you open the trunk and some high school kid comes out, loads up your trunk with the
[01:10.320 --> 01:19.360]  stuff, gives you a wave and you never even had to open your window, right? Nothing, it's great.
[01:19.360 --> 01:26.000]  It really is awesome but it also, like, we just did this a couple weeks ago, it also made me feel
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  like we were back in the midst of the pandemic, you know what I mean? Like when you're terrified
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.480]  to do anything, it's like, hey, I would have opened my window, I'm not actually afraid, I'm vaccinated,
[01:34.480 --> 01:37.840]  you know, but it was kind of crazy. I was like, this would have been awesome, like,
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.240]  back in like early 2020 when we were like terrified and we're like washing our vegetables
[01:44.240 --> 01:52.720]  and leaving all the packages like in a vestibule for a 24-hour germ-free period, this would have
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.960]  been great, just have a kid put all this crap in your trunk. And the thing is, everybody has those
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.000]  types of services now, even McDonald's, I mean, you pull up and, you know, you can get food there
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.040]  and every business has that type of curbside pickup now. It's funny how businesses have adapted
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.480]  so quickly. We're two years into this, but still, you know, you can just dial up an order,
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.400]  like you said, drive in, hey, we're here, and out they come.
[02:21.120 --> 02:25.200]  All right, let me take a break here and let's get this show going. Let's thank our first sponsor.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.800]  It is Mack Weldon. The holiday season is here and with it come the annual questions,
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.320]  what do I wear to non-ugly sweater parties? How do I maximize my time savoring the holiday moments,
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.680]  minimize my time shopping for gifts? Guess what? Fear not, go to Mack Weldon, whether it's an
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.400]  office party, a party with family and friends, or just a holiday party of you, your couch,
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.920]  your family, and a game on TV, Mack Weldon has all of the essentials to keep you stylish and
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.160]  comfortable throughout the season. And their innovative daily wear system has taken the hard
[02:56.160 --> 03:02.000]  work out of outfit planning with pieces designed to work together for any occasion, saving you time,
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.080]  money, and sparing you any extra holiday stress. I love Mack Weldon stuff. I got their slippers
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.160]  on right now. Oh man, don't even get me started on their slippers. Last time I told you about
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.920]  the slippers, they sold out of them right away. Just take my word for it. If you want slippers,
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.680]  Mack Weldon's slippers are the best. I just put a new pair on a couple weeks ago to start the
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.680]  winter season. Oh, my feet are so toasty, but they've got everything. Sweatshirts, sweatpants,
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.360]  warm knit collection. The warm knit thing is sort of like a waffle knit shirt, very thin shirt.
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.440]  Doesn't look like it would be warm like a sweatshirt, but it is. It's incredible. They use
[03:37.440 --> 03:43.360]  like advanced fabric technology that I don't even understand. I love it. It's great for the winter,
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.080]  and they've got everything from underwear to socks, sweatpants, sweatshirts, all this stuff.
[03:48.080 --> 03:57.520]  I love it. You can get 20% off your first order at mackweldon.com, m-a-c-k-w-e-l-d-o-n,

[04:12.160 --> 04:20.560]  So, Jim, tell me a story about how you got started writing about Apple and reporting on Apple
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.480]  back in the day. What was the first time that you started writing about Apple?
[04:26.160 --> 04:36.800]  Well, that was 1994. There were no daily Mac news sites. And I do believe
[04:36.800 --> 04:46.560]  that the first actual daily site doing news type of stuff was Mac Central, the one that we started
[04:46.560 --> 04:55.040]  back in 94. Mac in Touch was around then, I believe. So they were the original. But yeah,
[04:55.040 --> 05:02.480]  we started writing about Macs just because, you know, well, we didn't want a boss. We both worked
[05:02.480 --> 05:11.920]  in a newspaper. We didn't want a boss. Who's we? Oh, Stan Flatt. And he's sadly passed away about
[05:11.920 --> 05:18.320]  what, like 20 years ago? Well, no, it was probably about 10 years ago, I guess, that
[05:19.120 --> 05:25.520]  he passed away. Yeah. And we started it as a magazine first, you know, one of those
[05:25.520 --> 05:33.600]  ezines. And then we closed it down and then just a couple of months later or a month later started
[05:33.600 --> 05:39.120]  to back up again. But this time did a website. We just wrote and wrote and wrote. And it was
[05:39.120 --> 05:49.040]  so funny. At that point, companies were sending out press releases via mail. They would mail us
[05:49.040 --> 05:54.240]  press releases. So the news would be about a week late. Nobody knew it was a week late.
[05:54.240 --> 05:58.000]  Nobody knew it was a week late. The freshest it could possibly be. It was already like three or
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.520]  four days old. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Now we're talking a week late. It's a week late. Yeah.
[06:04.080 --> 06:10.640]  So I remember we would go home on our lunch break from our jobs. The mail would have come by then,
[06:10.640 --> 06:16.480]  post whatever news we could, and then go back to work. And I remember one time Stan went home and
[06:16.480 --> 06:25.440]  posted a story about Norton Diklok, if you remember that way back, except he put in the
[06:25.440 --> 06:35.760]  headline Diklok. So it was there for like a whole afternoon of Norton Diklok. And I don't know if
[06:35.760 --> 06:41.280]  they ever wrote a letter saying, hey, you know, it's probably not good, but we've all been there.
[06:41.280 --> 06:48.880]  Yeah. So, you know, that's really how it started. And we just, we never stopped, you know.
[06:49.680 --> 06:54.160]  But things have changed quite a bit. You know, everybody has a story like that,
[06:54.160 --> 07:00.720]  like the time that they posted the thing and walked away from the computer. And at the time,
[07:00.720 --> 07:04.400]  we didn't have cell phones, right? So you couldn't like notify, you know what I mean? Like,
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.880]  you were either at your computer and if you're at your computer and you're like, hey, Stan,
[07:08.880 --> 07:17.920]  the headline has a dick in it. You know, he'd be like, he would be like, oh shit. And he'd
[07:17.920 --> 07:21.360]  fix it right away. But if he's not at his computer, you can't really get ahold of him.
[07:21.920 --> 07:26.800]  I remember in college, the one time we really messed up in the Drexel University paper,
[07:26.800 --> 07:33.280]  it was the sports section. And the headline was real big. It was like, you know,
[07:33.280 --> 07:45.360]  96 point type. Headline goes here. I'm very proud of my time at the Drexel triangle back in the
[07:45.360 --> 07:49.840]  90s or right around that time, really, 94, 95, right when you were doing Mac Central.
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.320]  We ran a good paper. It was a good looking paper. It was well-designed. It was well-written. We made
[07:54.320 --> 08:00.000]  very few mistakes like that, but son of a bitch, we went to press. And that's the thing is it's,
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.520]  it's even with the web, even if you have a dick in the headline overnight, you could still fix it
[08:05.520 --> 08:10.240]  the next morning. There was nothing to do with 5,000 printed copies of the Drexel triangle that
[08:10.240 --> 08:16.800]  said headline goes here. But the best part, the best part was that we had a really good
[08:16.800 --> 08:21.120]  sense of humor. We took it seriously, you know, and like the front page with the university news,
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.760]  you know, the president of the university says such and such, you know, we played it straight.
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.120]  But like our entertainment section, we were always willing to have fun with stuff. And because we ran
[08:31.120 --> 08:34.240]  lots of funny headlines, there were a lot of people who thought it was on purpose.
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.280]  And we were like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a joke. It was a total joke. Yeah,
[08:39.280 --> 08:42.240]  we did that on purpose. Headline. That's how good we are. Headline goes here.
[08:47.120 --> 08:51.200]  There's always those, like you said. It would have been, I would have felt so much better if
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.400]  it was like a small article, you know, like I'm talking, this one went right across the whole top
[08:56.400 --> 09:02.160]  of the tabloid sports page. Like it would have been great. Let's say like the men's
[09:02.160 --> 09:06.560]  tennis team had like a match. Well, you know, that's like a one column story, right? That would
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.440]  have, oh, headline goes here in a tiny little one column story. That would have made me feel so much
[09:11.440 --> 09:19.680]  better. I can't win them all. No, I remember though. I remember reading Mac Central voraciously.
[09:19.680 --> 09:27.120]  I've told this before on the show, but at the time you'll remember there were Mac user and Mac world
[09:27.120 --> 09:35.200]  were the monthly magazines and they are both big. They, you know, Mac user was sort of more casual.
[09:35.760 --> 09:42.000]  There was sort of a formality to Mac world. Mac world was sort of like the New York times and Mac
[09:42.000 --> 09:49.120]  user was like the New York post, right? It was sort of the more fun and I liked them both. I
[09:49.120 --> 09:54.640]  bought them both and read them both cover to cover every month, but they had these crazy long lead
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.520]  times, right? Like it, people don't realize it, but like back then, like printed magazines,
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.640]  like Mac world had like a three month lead time and Apple knew it. The other companies knew it.
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.800]  So like Apple would like, you know, go to Mac world or Mac user months before new computers
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.000]  would come out and let them know because otherwise by the time they published the information about
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.560]  the new computers, it would be four months late. But the way to stay on top of the Apple universe
[10:22.560 --> 10:31.040]  was Mac week, right? Yes, there was Mac week. There was info world and there was PC week.
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.640]  I think those were the three big ones and they were weekly newspapers. They were,
[10:36.640 --> 10:39.120]  they would dig in dumpsters, right? They would.
[10:39.120 --> 10:48.720]  Uh, but it was hard to get a subscription. They wouldn't take your money. This is the biggest
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.240]  thing. Like if you would just be like, I would like to give you a hundred dollars a year. So
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.840]  you would send me your Mac week every week. They would say, no, you had to like fill out a form
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.080]  and, and claim, you know, like, well, what company do you work for? How many Macs do you buy? What's
[11:04.080 --> 11:10.240]  your job? How much, what's your software budget per year? And I would continuously fill out these
[11:10.240 --> 11:18.000]  cards with a series of fake names, trying to get a subscription to Mac week. And then I would,
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.600]  I would hear from people that are like, Oh yeah, I filled one out. And now they just send one to my
[11:21.600 --> 11:27.360]  house every week. And it's like, son of a bitch. They will not, I send these cards in all the time
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.160]  and they never, they didn't even want money. They just wanted somehow to believe that you
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.680]  were a professional who was in the advertising demographic, you know, to buy software and,
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.040]  and, you know, desks and chairs and whatever else they advertised in Mac week. I could not do it.
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.120]  So I used to have to read it at the Drexel university library. It was the only thing I
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.360]  ever did in the, in the library. I never, I never took a book. I would go in and read Mac week.
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.640]  Yeah. It's, it's amazing how, how tough it was. I could never get it.
[12:00.640 --> 12:06.640]  But then, you know, when the web came out and you could suddenly go to Mac central and Mac and
[12:06.640 --> 12:12.080]  touch and a few other sites and get like news on a daily basis instead of weekly basis, and you
[12:12.080 --> 12:18.320]  didn't even have to go to the library at the university to get the one copy of Mac week,
[12:18.320 --> 12:24.080]  it was game-changing. Even though it was, you know, four or five days after the fact,
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.960]  it was still breaking news at that point. Well, and it was great too, because the other thing,
[12:28.960 --> 12:35.360]  it was so hard before, like, let's say that you, there are apps that are still around, right?
[12:35.360 --> 12:39.440]  There's like graphic converter and BB edit. There's a couple of apps from that era that are
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.400]  still around, but let's say you were into graphic converter, which is a great, it does exactly what
[12:44.400 --> 12:50.560]  you think it does. It's just a Swiss army knife of being able to open any image format ever known to
[12:50.560 --> 12:56.240]  mankind and export it to another format. If a new version came out, you had no idea that a new
[12:56.240 --> 13:02.160]  version came out because apps didn't check for versions because they couldn't assume an internet
[13:02.160 --> 13:08.320]  connection, a site like Mac central to just say, Hey, you know, the graphic converter 1.6 is out,
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.760]  here's the new features. And it was like, this is amazing. And then you would go to the website and
[13:13.760 --> 13:22.800]  download it and, you know, and then 90 minutes later, the download would finish. And you would
[13:22.800 --> 13:33.760]  do that on Netscape 2.02, which crashed every 30 seconds. Yeah. But that's it. It is funny though.
[13:33.760 --> 13:40.320]  And you guys played it so straight. I never picked up and I'm an astute reader and I obviously
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.680]  got into the same racket, not too many years later. It never occurred to me that it was just
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.000]  two of you. I thought you guys had, I thought you guys had like a small startup, maybe like a
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.400]  dozen people on the staff. We actually did that on purpose. We thought about that and had like
[14:00.400 --> 14:06.400]  our family names with their mother's maiden name listed on the one, the masthead. We had all kinds
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.840]  of things going on just to make it seem bigger because at that point you really, that was the
[14:11.840 --> 14:18.240]  thing, you know, it's not anymore. I mean, people know that during fireball was you. But at that
[14:18.240 --> 14:25.920]  point you kind of needed that. So yeah, we gamed it a little bit and that's what it seemed. But
[14:25.920 --> 14:35.520]  in doing that, you know, up until 96, 97, we still had our jobs, but then, you know,
[14:35.520 --> 14:43.680]  things kind of took off and we quit our jobs at the newspaper and it was just all day long
[14:43.680 --> 14:53.040]  of posting stuff, going probably 20 or 30 stories a day up on the website. Sometimes
[14:53.760 --> 15:01.840]  took a lot of work, but it worked out, you know, I'm still here. It's on, I'm almost 30 years in
[15:01.840 --> 15:07.760]  now. It's a long time. It's funny though, because that transition period was in hindsight, like a
[15:07.760 --> 15:14.560]  snap of the fingers where it went from, how do companies distribute press releases? They have
[15:14.560 --> 15:20.160]  a physical mailing list and they print labels and they come out of an actual printer. They put them
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.640]  on envelopes. They put stamps on the envelope. They stuff the press release into the envelope,
[15:24.640 --> 15:30.880]  and then it goes out in the mail. And four days later, Nova Scotia Post delivers it to Jim
[15:30.880 --> 15:38.160]  Dalrymple. And within like two years, everything went to email and everything was immediate. Even
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.600]  just two years was the difference between everything goes in the physical mail to
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.080]  nothing goes in the physical mail. Right. Yeah, it was very, very quick.
[15:48.720 --> 15:55.760]  And I think it started to happen sooner than what they thought. I mean, companies didn't always have
[15:55.760 --> 16:03.120]  websites. I remember eWorld and AOL, they would sometimes have those, but once they started
[16:03.920 --> 16:11.200]  updating their website wherever it happened to be, you know, it could be the day after
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.520]  or two days after, but that was still three days before the press release would show up by mail,
[16:17.520 --> 16:27.680]  we would get it online and it was this race to get things up. I'm glad that that doesn't happen
[16:27.680 --> 16:34.800]  so much anymore. It's not that race anymore to get things up because, you know, now the things
[16:34.800 --> 16:41.840]  that you write and the things that I write are more thoughtful. And I like that a whole lot
[16:41.840 --> 16:49.840]  a whole lot better. Yeah, I do too. It's funny. It just took a while to settle in, right? To sort
[16:49.840 --> 16:57.680]  of find the equilibrium of, okay, this is the pace. If you really want breaking news as it
[16:57.680 --> 17:03.200]  breaks, you know which sites to go to. But for the most part, if you just want to check in once a day,
[17:03.200 --> 17:07.840]  you can check in, you know, your site is a perfect example. You could just check in once a day,
[17:07.840 --> 17:13.040]  scroll down the page till you see the post you remember seeing yesterday and then know that
[17:13.040 --> 17:21.520]  you're caught up and that nothing major happened, you know. Well, yeah, and Dave Mark does posting
[17:21.520 --> 17:30.880]  on The Loop and he does a great job of picking out these great posts that I think people find
[17:30.880 --> 17:36.960]  interesting. And then, you know, if an event happens and I write something about that and,
[17:36.960 --> 17:44.560]  you know, I have my thoughts on Apple and what happened and, you know, I think there's a good
[17:44.560 --> 17:52.080]  mix there. But I really do like that change. And when it came down to how things started changing,
[17:52.080 --> 17:59.280]  you were one of the ones that really changed the way that people thought of websites
[17:59.280 --> 18:07.840]  with the headline and the blurb, like the thoughtful commentary that you had on the news
[18:08.400 --> 18:16.720]  really kind of changed the way that news websites started to react to news. It wasn't about being
[18:16.720 --> 18:22.720]  first to get something up. It was more about, let's think about this for a minute, especially
[18:22.720 --> 18:31.360]  with big Apple news. I think even with reviews still, your embargo time can come and go and
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.200]  yours still isn't there.
[18:33.200 --> 18:38.320]  Mine often goes, it just goes whooshing right overhead.
[18:39.280 --> 18:47.760]  Yeah. But, you know, people wait for your review because it is so thoughtful. And that's the way
[18:47.760 --> 18:54.880]  that things should be. You know, you could see the change coming a couple of years after you started
[18:54.880 --> 19:02.880]  Daring Fireball. I remember in 2009 when I started The Loop after I left Macworld, I called you
[19:04.080 --> 19:12.160]  and said, hey, you know, I'm doing this thing. I'm going to do a Daring Fireball type of thing.
[19:12.160 --> 19:14.160]  I just want to make sure that you're okay with it.
[19:14.160 --> 19:19.520]  I was more than okay. I was like, please start so I can start linking to your articles. Right?
[19:20.640 --> 19:24.000]  Yeah, that was exactly what you said. Go for it.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.320]  I do not like to toot my own horn. I really don't. You're making me uncomfortable. I've broken out
[19:28.320 --> 19:38.160]  into a bit of a flop. But I will say one of my all-time favorite quotes about computers in
[19:38.160 --> 19:44.320]  general is it I actually don't have the actual quote, but Larry Wall, the creator of the Perl
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.880]  programming language, and he might be just quoting something that was floating around the Unix
[19:48.880 --> 19:57.040]  circles forever. But he said that, you know, good programmers are lazy. And the idea is that they're
[19:57.040 --> 20:00.480]  lazy because they don't want to repeat themselves. So if there's something they do over and over
[20:00.480 --> 20:04.480]  again, then they write a program that does the thing over and over again. And they just keep
[20:04.480 --> 20:09.440]  writing programs so that they don't have to do more work. And that's sort of the mentality
[20:09.440 --> 20:17.440]  behind the link items on Daring Fireball. And at the beginning, you know, and Kottke was doing
[20:17.440 --> 20:24.480]  stuff like this, not technical or Apple specific, but Kottke had links and Andy Baio had a little
[20:24.480 --> 20:31.840]  sidebar on his blog where he'd have like little 10-word links. Jim Kudall, kudall.com, the whole
[20:31.840 --> 20:38.560]  middle column is just really brief links. To me, that captures the entire magic of the web,
[20:38.560 --> 20:44.560]  right? What is the difference between getting a printed copy of Mac Week every Friday in the
[20:44.560 --> 20:54.240]  mail and you can read it and be like up to the week on Apple News versus the web? And
[20:55.360 --> 21:00.480]  the first thought was, well, printing is expensive, incredibly expensive,
[21:00.480 --> 21:06.480]  always has been expensive. And so you cut down on this cost. The mail is incredibly expensive.
[21:06.480 --> 21:09.920]  You know, I was talking about my student newspaper, you know, when I was at university,
[21:10.960 --> 21:15.600]  printing was incredibly expensive. That was like our whole budget. Like everything we did was just
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.400]  to, you know, actually print these copies of the paper and then distribute them around campus. But
[21:21.200 --> 21:28.160]  we had a thing called the green machine. It was like a John Deere, like a little go-kart
[21:28.160 --> 21:34.880]  tractor type thing. And we had a guy named Ryan. He was a great guy. He had nothing to do with the
[21:34.880 --> 21:40.320]  actual editorial of the newspaper. He wasn't a writer. He didn't edit, but he was always
[21:40.320 --> 21:45.760]  enthusiastic. But what he liked to do was get up early on Friday morning, pick up all these
[21:45.760 --> 21:50.880]  printed papers, put them on the green machine, and then drive them around campus. And every building
[21:50.880 --> 21:55.120]  where there were classes, then there was like a, you know, big pile of student newspapers that you
[21:55.120 --> 22:00.720]  could pick up for free. But we didn't have to mail them, right? Like mailing was incredibly expensive.
[22:00.720 --> 22:07.360]  So the first thought any of us had in the 90s as to how to build a website, it was just like,
[22:07.360 --> 22:11.440]  well, this is sort of like having a print publication, but we don't have to pay for
[22:11.440 --> 22:19.520]  printing or the mail. And all you have to do is wait two minutes for your modem to download this
[22:19.520 --> 22:25.680]  tiny little webpage by today's standards that was measured in kilobytes, but it still took forever
[22:25.680 --> 22:32.640]  to render. But it was certainly better than waiting for paper to come to your house.
[22:33.280 --> 22:38.320]  It shifted then though, right? It was like the first idea was we could just do what we did in
[22:38.320 --> 22:43.200]  print, but not pay for the print. And then it became, hey, wait a minute, we don't have to do
[22:43.200 --> 22:50.640]  like a once a week issue. We could like just publish everything as it comes in. That to me
[22:50.640 --> 22:57.760]  was the mind blown. And I know it dates me. I know that it, you know, because today, you know,
[22:57.760 --> 23:04.240]  kids today, like our kids, they would never think about running a publication where you wait until
[23:04.880 --> 23:11.680]  Friday morning and then you have seven days worth of material queued up, ready to go and an issue
[23:11.680 --> 23:19.440]  comes out, right? But that was the way it had to be with print. And the early web mimicked it
[23:19.440 --> 23:25.280]  because every new medium always incorrectly copies the medium that came before it.
[23:25.840 --> 23:32.880]  Correct. Yeah. I remember when at the newspaper, when I told them I was quitting to do this
[23:33.680 --> 23:39.680]  online publication, they said, you're crazy. That'll never work. It will never work.
[23:39.680 --> 23:47.760]  And I said, no, I think it will. I really do. I think that this is where it's going. And,
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.280]  you know, you guys, one day you guys are going to have to have a website. And they said, oh,
[23:53.280 --> 23:57.440]  we'll never have a website. We don't need a website and that stuff. It's not going to work.
[23:57.440 --> 24:05.680]  And it did. You know, luckily for us a few years later, Macworld bought Mac Central and
[24:05.680 --> 24:13.200]  that was in 99. But that really was sort of the intersection of exactly what I'm talking about,
[24:13.200 --> 24:21.600]  where Macworld was the gold standard in the Apple journalism space, the Apple specific space. It was
[24:21.600 --> 24:30.480]  the premier publication, but it was a printed publication with tons and tons of print ads,
[24:30.480 --> 24:36.240]  tons of print ads, you know, and it back in those days, those issues were like half a phone book,
[24:36.240 --> 24:43.520]  you know, they were huge, crazy thick, but they had these crazy long lead times. So it was like
[24:43.520 --> 24:50.720]  the two extremes where Macworld, the magazine had like a two or three month lead time and was
[24:50.720 --> 24:57.440]  a printed thing that was super thick and had just the absolute utmost of production quality
[24:57.440 --> 25:03.920]  printed on the best paper, the super high quality, professional photography for all the product
[25:03.920 --> 25:10.240]  shots. And then on the other end, there's Mac Central, which, you know, it wasn't like it didn't
[25:10.240 --> 25:17.360]  look professional, but it looked quick and there was no way to do high resolution graphics on the
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.040]  web at the time. And the last thing you would want is something that would take longer to download
[25:23.040 --> 25:27.440]  over these crazy slow modems. It looked professional, like I told you, I couldn't believe it
[25:27.440 --> 25:38.560]  that when I found out that it was just two people and one of them was you. You know, it's funny how
[25:38.560 --> 25:46.480]  much we learned after that when we came into the Macworld, you know, Jason Snell, I love Jason,
[25:46.480 --> 25:54.960]  he's so smart. And, you know, sitting down talking about magazines, we were just dumbfounded,
[25:54.960 --> 26:02.800]  like how much went into that. And, you know, Rick LaPage was around then. I mean, just so many
[26:02.800 --> 26:09.280]  great people. And, you know, Jason is still going strong. I mean, he knew more about magazines than
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.480]  I'll ever know. All right. Let me take another break here. Thank our next sponsor. It's our
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.080]  good friends at Earnest. Oh, let's talk student debt. Oh, what could be more fun than talking

[28:35.280 --> 28:41.040]  what I mean? That's a lot of laws around that. It's the holidays, you know, there's not that
[28:41.040 --> 28:47.760]  much going on. I thought having you on it would be interesting, the trip down memory lane with
[28:47.760 --> 28:53.840]  the early days of my central. But the other thing, too, I think it's interesting this year
[28:54.560 --> 29:01.440]  with with the current political climate and with the the, you know, app apples in the midst of
[29:01.440 --> 29:10.000]  this, the EU is seemingly heading towards passing some laws and regulations that are definitely
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  going to affect Apple if they pass, you know, like this thing about mandatory sideloading for
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.080]  mobile phones. And just here and there all over the place, did you see the thing where Italy find
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.640]  Google and Apple? I don't know, it's just a couple million dollars, whatever, it's pocket change to
[29:24.640 --> 29:31.680]  Apple and Google. But the publicity adds up that Italy found them to be, you know, breaking some
[29:31.680 --> 29:38.320]  kind of antitrust law, whatever doesn't even matter. It's it's it's optics, right? It's, you
[29:38.320 --> 29:45.920]  know, and it's funny having written about Apple as long as I have. And as we were just talking,
[29:45.920 --> 29:49.040]  you're, you know, you're a little bit ahead of me a couple more years ahead of me. But
[29:50.560 --> 29:58.240]  it would have been bananas in 1996 to say, hey, 25 years from now, Apple is going to be facing
[29:58.240 --> 30:07.840]  worldwide antitrust scrutiny. Well, 25 years ago, it was almost incredible to think that Apple would
[30:07.840 --> 30:11.920]  still be around. Right? That would have been it would have been good enough to hear that they're
[30:11.920 --> 30:16.000]  still around. You'd be like, Whoa, thank God. And you'd be like, Oh, no, no, they're not still
[30:16.000 --> 30:22.000]  around. They're actually in big, big trouble for their overwhelming success. And they're facing the
[30:22.000 --> 30:29.280]  barrels of regulators in the EU and in America and in Asia. And it's like, what? You're kidding
[30:29.280 --> 30:39.120]  me? They're still in business? Yeah, true. So I'm curious. And to me, one of the things that makes
[30:39.120 --> 30:50.800]  it salient is that Apple has a if you want to put it in negative terms, I would use the word insular.
[30:51.600 --> 30:58.320]  But I think it's good. I think it has served the company well, that for the most part they promote
[30:58.320 --> 31:03.200]  from within. And it's a company where a lot of people spend their whole careers,
[31:03.200 --> 31:12.560]  a lot of people I know. And even people whose whose overall career isn't one continuous stint
[31:12.560 --> 31:19.600]  at Apple, they leave, and then they come back 345 years later, you know, at a higher level,
[31:19.600 --> 31:25.120]  because they left went elsewhere, leveled up in their career, and then come back, you know,
[31:25.120 --> 31:29.520]  and maybe instead of being an engineer, and now they're an engineering manager or something like
[31:29.520 --> 31:34.480]  that. I think overall, it has served the company well, because there is an Apple way of doing
[31:34.480 --> 31:40.320]  things. And it served the company. And we can all complain about this, that the other thing,
[31:40.320 --> 31:46.560]  our own pet peeves about Apple products, and where, you know, where we have minor complaints,
[31:46.560 --> 31:53.920]  but for the most part, they've clearly stuck to it, right? There's, if you went back to our
[31:53.920 --> 32:00.720]  1996 cells, you editing Mac Central, me reading Mac Central at Drexel University,
[32:00.720 --> 32:06.080]  and showed us modern Apple products, we would recognize them as Apple products, we'd be like,
[32:06.080 --> 32:10.480]  oh, that that the future is going to be amazing. I love these retina screens. Look at that. You
[32:10.480 --> 32:18.080]  can't see the pixels, you know, there's an Apple flavor to them, right? Yes, that that is very
[32:18.080 --> 32:24.560]  consistent. But I really wonder if if one of the biggest problems Apple is facing, though,
[32:24.560 --> 32:30.480]  is that the fact that so many people at Apple, including senior leadership at this point have
[32:30.480 --> 32:38.160]  been there for their whole careers, that they've internalized that mentality of being the little
[32:38.160 --> 32:47.120]  guy, who we're worried is still going to be in business in a year. And that attitude, that
[32:47.120 --> 32:51.760]  perspective doesn't serve them well, now that they're the most valuable company on the planet.
[32:52.960 --> 32:57.680]  And that they continue to make mistakes based on that. I don't know, do you see that?
[32:59.040 --> 33:06.160]  It's kind of tough, because one of the things that we love about Apple is that they do continue
[33:06.160 --> 33:16.960]  to have that mentality. I see Apple as having the thoughts of doing things the right way
[33:17.600 --> 33:27.280]  for the customer. And, you know, through the years, we've seen Apple take stances that
[33:27.280 --> 33:33.920]  were not popular, whether it's, you know, in products, I mean, way back removing floppy disks,
[33:33.920 --> 33:42.480]  or political stances, or semi-political stances with privacy, like, no, we are not going to take
[33:42.480 --> 33:47.680]  your information, we don't want your information. As a matter of fact, we're going to proactively
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.560]  make sure we never see your information. You know, in a lot of ways, that could have held
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.040]  Apple back in features that they could have implemented that maybe we would have liked,
[33:59.040 --> 34:06.240]  but they made sure that they did it the right way. They won't open up back doors for governments.
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.840]  They won't unlock phones for law enforcement agencies. They do things,
[34:13.120 --> 34:19.920]  I think, for the right reasons. And that comes back, for me, that comes back to the mentality
[34:21.600 --> 34:28.000]  that you're kind of talking about here. So there are a lot of things that are good and bad about
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.200]  that.
[34:29.200 --> 34:35.200]  A perfect example of that is my last episode of the show, David underscore Smith was my guest,
[34:35.200 --> 34:42.560]  and we were talking about widgets. And that the most popular thing people use with his app,
[34:42.560 --> 34:48.880]  Widget Smith, is to create like a photo frame widget, where you pick one photo, you're like,
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.960]  this is it, this is me and my family, and we're at the Grand Canyon, and I just love
[34:54.960 --> 35:00.480]  and I just love this family photo. I would like to have it on my second home screen,
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.400]  always. And you can make like a photo widget frame like that. But we were talking about the
[35:06.400 --> 35:12.800]  official Apple Photos widget, which the only option you have is to take their AI powered
[35:12.800 --> 35:17.600]  recommendations. But they're amazing, right? Everybody loves to talk about it. They surface
[35:17.600 --> 35:24.640]  amazing photos, the machine learning, however they programmed it, and whatever model they have,
[35:24.640 --> 35:31.760]  it's really almost astonishingly good how it surfaces these photos. But it's absolutely
[35:31.760 --> 35:36.480]  the case that, you know, four or five years ago, everybody was talking about Apple being
[35:36.480 --> 35:43.280]  behind in that exact area, right? Because maybe Google and Facebook and the places that
[35:43.280 --> 35:52.560]  had your photos in the cloud on their servers were running similar, but just as amazing
[35:52.560 --> 35:58.640]  at surfacing these photos. But because they could run it in the cloud, they didn't have to worry
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.600]  about not even the privacy type stuff, but just the fact that, hey, it's our server in the cloud,
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.640]  it's not your battery operated phone, so we're not going to deplete the battery on your phone
[36:10.640 --> 36:15.280]  while trying to analyze which are the best pictures of your kids from 10 years ago.
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.720]  Because nobody wants that, right? Everybody wants these great pictures to be surfaced,
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.880]  but they don't want their phone to be dead because it figured out which ones they are.
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.880]  And Apple's responses over the years, you know, interviews with me, interviews with other people,
[36:28.880 --> 36:34.560]  and they would say, we're confident that our on-device strategy is going to work out in the
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.680]  long run. And it has. And now that it has, people don't really talk about it anymore.
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.160]  It's one of those things where it was like, when it seemed like Apple was behind, everybody wanted
[36:44.160 --> 36:50.480]  to talk about the fact that Apple's privacy stance and adamance that everything run on device was
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.960]  holding them back. And then once it was clear that it wasn't holding them back, now nobody talks
[36:54.960 --> 37:04.000]  about it. Right. Apple has that a lot where people are great about coming out and saying, oh,
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.960]  God, this'll never work with Apple. And then it just goes away because it does work.
[37:10.960 --> 37:18.480]  I mean, how many times has Apple been the first at doing something? You know, if you look even at
[37:18.480 --> 37:26.160]  products, back to the iPod, you know, Apple wasn't the first one with a music player. They weren't,
[37:26.160 --> 37:32.160]  you know, the first one with USB, but they made these things so popular. Firewire,
[37:32.160 --> 37:39.760]  Firewire. I mean, just so many things. No, but it wasn't that amazing that the first iPod was
[37:39.760 --> 37:48.240]  Firewire. Apple has popularized so many technologies that they, you know, they didn't
[37:48.240 --> 37:56.320]  actually invent, but they did it in a way that made it available to the mass market. And they're
[37:56.320 --> 38:05.360]  still doing that. If you look at the new stuff that they're working on, I mean, AR, I don't know
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.680]  that they'll be big into VR, but augmented reality, I think is going to be a huge thing for Apple in
[38:11.680 --> 38:18.320]  the coming years. And who knows what they're going to be able to do with it. We see glimpses of it
[38:18.320 --> 38:24.960]  every now and then, like in maps with walking directions. I actually use that once. I don't know
[38:24.960 --> 38:31.520]  how to use that once. And it was fascinating. You know, that's one of the few things where
[38:31.520 --> 38:40.720]  it defines why I do what I do is I feel like my ability is much more suited to being a critic
[38:40.720 --> 38:46.320]  of things that have come out, both good and bad. Say both, this is what's good about it. This is
[38:46.320 --> 38:56.400]  bad about it. And I try never to pretend that that's in any way better than being the designers
[38:56.400 --> 39:02.480]  and engineers who are actually in the arena, making the new things, right. But one of the
[39:02.480 --> 39:08.880]  things that I've thought was so obvious for years is that you should be able to just hold your phone
[39:08.880 --> 39:15.280]  up when you're like walking around the city. Your phone has a camera. It has GPS. The phone,
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.440]  based on the camera and the GPS, should obviously know where it is, where it's oriented, and should
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.040]  be able to give you a heads-up display to tell you, here's how to walk to the restaurant you're
[39:27.040 --> 39:34.320]  looking for. And I get why we're not quite there yet, but it's clear that that's where we're going
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.800]  and that if you could project that onto eyeglasses, that would be fantastic, right?
[39:38.800 --> 39:44.880]  Just see what you normally see through your eyeglasses, except there's like a green arrow
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.760]  in front of you telling you which way to go. Keep going. Keep going. Go across this intersection.
[39:49.760 --> 39:50.800]  All right, now make a left.
[39:52.560 --> 39:59.920]  I mean, the things that are coming are going to be as incredible to people now as some of
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.760]  the products that they brought out early on. They are just going to keep going. And that's
[40:05.760 --> 40:12.160]  one thing that I have respect for, too, the whole industry. I mean, it
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.640]  moves so fast. We talked about this with how our businesses moved quickly, but all of this
[40:20.640 --> 40:28.480]  is moving very quickly. And that's where when Apple puts in things like privacy as one of
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.840]  the standards that has to be met before these features go out. That's why that is so important.
[40:33.840 --> 40:42.720]  And when you look, you mentioned the sometimes political fallout from some of this. I don't
[40:42.720 --> 40:52.320]  quite understand or agree with the politicians that say, well, we need access. I understand
[40:52.320 --> 41:00.800]  why they do, but the fact that Apple is willing to protect users is very important to me.
[41:00.800 --> 41:03.040]  Users is very important to me.
[41:05.280 --> 41:15.760]  So let me circle back and try to pick your brain on where you think Apple's senior leadership
[41:15.760 --> 41:22.720]  is. Are they in the right place or in terms of preparing for the next 10 years
[41:22.720 --> 41:31.760]  of innovations? Or are they too focused on keeping the incredible success that they have right now
[41:31.760 --> 41:38.320]  with the, if you just freeze frame Apple's business today, it is incredibly profitable.
[41:38.320 --> 41:46.560]  The iPhone is an incredibly profitable device and the App Store model makes for an incredible
[41:46.560 --> 41:54.160]  services add on to the phone. And Tim Cook has said it, I think it goes all the way back to
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.160]  Steve Jobs, even that, hey, if anybody's going to cannibalize one of our successful businesses,
[42:00.160 --> 42:07.920]  it should be us. And famously, they really truly did what they said with the iPod and the way that
[42:07.920 --> 42:15.680]  the iPhone just absolutely almost instantly extinguished the iPod business. Absolutely did.
[42:15.680 --> 42:22.400]  Right. They really did. They did not try to protect it. And it was their fastest growing
[42:22.400 --> 42:29.520]  segment. It was the thing that made them relevant to an entirely new generation of younger people.
[42:30.160 --> 42:37.440]  It also exposed them to people like our generation who never used Macintosh computers, maybe still
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.560]  haven't used Macintosh computers, but suddenly had a reason to buy an Apple product. Because
[42:42.560 --> 42:48.640]  even if you used a Windows PC, the iPod was still the best music player. And
[42:51.280 --> 42:54.320]  they just, they made a product that just made it irrelevant.
[42:55.360 --> 43:00.800]  And yeah, and they were very happy to do it. Do you think they're willing to do that again?
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.800]  And what happens if that next product is not a thousand dollar product? What if it's only a
[43:06.800 --> 43:13.360]  $500 product? Are they willing to cannibalize thousand dollar iPhones with $500 eyeglasses?
[43:14.400 --> 43:23.040]  Oh, yeah, I definitely think so. Because to me, it's about Apple moving ahead with the product
[43:23.040 --> 43:31.280]  line. If they weren't willing to do that with the iPhone, they weren't willing to put a music player
[43:31.280 --> 43:39.120]  on an iPhone and make that readily available. I don't think that the iPod business would have
[43:39.120 --> 43:45.760]  kept going at the pace that it was. And I think the same of the products now, they have to advance
[43:45.760 --> 43:51.200]  the product lines. And if one cannibalizes the other, then that's going to happen.
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.040]  You know, and it all comes down to sales after that.
[43:55.040 --> 44:04.800]  To me, it's about being honest with yourself. That's what I think is that there was a sense
[44:04.800 --> 44:14.080]  circa 2005, 2006, where anybody who's just looking at the, hey, what type of gadgets can I put in
[44:14.080 --> 44:21.280]  a pants pocket? You know, iPods, cell phones, there's, you know, and you could look at the
[44:21.280 --> 44:27.680]  cell phone and say, this is going to be the iPod, it's going to one way or the other, whether,
[44:27.680 --> 44:33.440]  you know, Apple got involved, even if Apple had stayed out of the market, and maybe cell phones
[44:33.440 --> 44:41.040]  evolve. And we're all using BlackBerry style devices with a hardware keyboard to this day,
[44:41.040 --> 44:50.240]  I think that was a feasible future. And it's not disrespectful to the people who made the iPod
[44:50.240 --> 45:01.040]  in 2001, 2002, 2003, in the early years, when making it easy, wasn't easy, right? I don't want
[45:01.040 --> 45:08.640]  to act as though it was easy for them to make it. But by the mid 2000s, it was pretty clear that
[45:08.640 --> 45:16.480]  everything that could play mp3 music was going to be able to play mp3 music. Yeah. And it was,
[45:16.480 --> 45:24.000]  you know, time to move on. I feel like, you know, we're clearly nothing like that is on the horizon
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.160]  for cell phones at this moment. But it will be eventually. And it will be Yeah. And in the
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.600]  eyeglasses thing is the best guess we have at the moment, you know, that you'll, you know,
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.440]  everybody will just wear spectacles of some sort. And you'll have this permanently, you know,
[45:41.440 --> 45:48.560]  anytime you need it, user interface in your field of vision, because you're wearing these glasses.
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.440]  That's the best guess. But I could see that I can also see a future where that never happens.
[45:55.680 --> 46:07.040]  Yeah. And, you know, we've seen that future in a way, when you look back at remember netbooks,
[46:07.040 --> 46:14.800]  everybody had a netbook, which was the worst computer of all time. And I remember,
[46:14.800 --> 46:24.400]  so it was probably around the 2010. Because I remember writing about this on the loop where
[46:27.200 --> 46:34.000]  people were saying Apple has to have a netbook. And it was mostly, amazingly, PC analysts that
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.360]  said Apple has to have a netbook in order to keep up. And I said, Apple will never have a netbook.
[46:41.360 --> 46:49.440]  And they didn't, because it was just a piece of chunk. And, you know, those eventually went away.
[46:50.000 --> 47:00.080]  So I don't think that Apple was willing to follow conventional wisdom or wisdom at the time,
[47:00.080 --> 47:03.600]  just to put out a product and compete with something else that's out there.
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.960]  They're going to improve that to the point where they can offer something. And that's
[47:08.960 --> 47:15.360]  where this new technology that we have, you know, is it glasses? It could be. But by the time Apple
[47:15.360 --> 47:20.640]  perfects what they're doing and is ready to release it, is it something completely different
[47:20.640 --> 47:29.120]  that we don't know yet? It could be that too. Yeah. And that's what I mean that you have to
[47:29.120 --> 47:35.440]  be honest with yourself, right? You have to honestly look at the state of the next thing.
[47:35.440 --> 47:42.400]  And instead of thinking, well, I really wish that this were ready to go. And to me, that's
[47:42.400 --> 47:49.680]  ultimately where Apple went wrong with the Newton. And I know that everybody likes to tell
[47:49.680 --> 47:58.080]  the story that the 10-second version is that it was a big flop. It wasn't a hit. It obviously
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.840]  was not a hit product. But it wasn't really a flop. It actually existed in a weird sort of
[48:04.400 --> 48:13.200]  netherworld where it was good enough to keep going and within a handful of years got much,
[48:13.200 --> 48:19.600]  much better. Like the Newton 2000, like the last models that they made, were really,
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.000]  really credible and were much, much better than like the Palm pilots of the day, even
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.440]  though the Palm was the one that everybody thinks was sort of the successful PDA of the era.
[48:32.800 --> 48:41.600]  But there was sort of a wishful thinking aspect to Apple launching the Newton when they launched
[48:41.600 --> 48:47.520]  it. That it was like, we know that this sort of basic, and they were right, that the basic
[48:47.520 --> 48:57.440]  idea of something you could fit in one hand and would have wireless connectivity and they were on
[48:57.440 --> 49:05.200]  the scent of what we now consider to be the smartphone. They were on the trail. It just
[49:05.200 --> 49:12.160]  was clearly so far away that it really needed to bake in the oven some more. But I feel like not
[49:12.160 --> 49:22.960]  to put John Sculley on the psychiatric couch, but maybe the itch to prove himself post Steve Jobs,
[49:22.960 --> 49:29.040]  Steve Jobs has left and he's next and he's doing some interesting stuff there. What is going to be
[49:29.040 --> 49:37.200]  John Sculley's first product post Steve Jobs? I kind of feel like they rushed it because he
[49:37.200 --> 49:45.760]  really wanted to get something out. Yeah. And, you know, I think he said it right that the Newton,
[49:45.760 --> 49:53.840]  that whole technology, when you look at what it did for people, it was pretty incredible. And
[49:53.840 --> 50:01.440]  there were, there was as much of a group around, you know, how great the Newton was as any other
[50:01.440 --> 50:08.880]  product. It was just, it was small. Yeah. But it was pretty incredible. I remember, you know,
[50:08.880 --> 50:17.760]  Stan had one of those and he was just fascinated with it. The potential was so high, but it was,
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.960]  it always, to me, I forget which one I had. I couldn't afford the 2000. So I, but I got like
[50:24.960 --> 50:32.720]  a discounted version of one that was discontinued and, you know, but it, it was clearly like, this
[50:32.720 --> 50:39.920]  is the future. But whereas the Macintosh to me was always, this is the present, right? Like even
[50:40.480 --> 50:47.040]  in the eighties, when the Mac was still dripping wet, brand new black and white,
[50:47.600 --> 50:52.080]  you know, monochrome displays and, and so much of its future was ahead of it.
[50:52.080 --> 50:58.000]  Even then it was like already right now, this is like the best way to do word processing. This is
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.000]  the best machine to use Excel on, right? This is the way to do spreadsheets. This is
[51:04.560 --> 51:10.800]  just a fabulous metaphor for personal computing. It was already great. Whereas the Newton
[51:11.360 --> 51:16.960]  was always about the future. And I feel like that's the mistake that, that companies always
[51:16.960 --> 51:25.760]  are tempted to make is to come out too early. And that's sort of where I feel like Facebook
[51:25.760 --> 51:33.440]  has gone with this whole VR meta thing where they're so anxious to change the story from
[51:34.560 --> 51:42.480]  the negative stories about the social stuff on Facebook to, you know, to get people talking
[51:42.480 --> 51:49.200]  about us as a company that's building this metaverse, blah, blah, blah, Oculus headsets,
[51:49.200 --> 51:55.200]  all this stuff. But they're so focused on what it's going to be as opposed to what it is now.
[51:55.200 --> 51:59.840]  And if you lose sight of what it is now, to me, you never get there. You'd never get to where you
[51:59.840 --> 52:11.760]  want to go. Well, yeah. And you know, I think that's kind of a crazy ass company. I try and
[52:11.760 --> 52:25.120]  stay away from them as much as possible. So it's hard when I don't trust them, right? So I don't
[52:25.120 --> 52:30.880]  trust what they're trying to do, what they will do. I don't trust anything about it, which is,
[52:30.880 --> 52:38.640]  you know, a huge difference when you look at what Apple is doing. I think that Apple is keeping
[52:38.640 --> 52:49.520]  their eye on what's happening now, but they always seem to be able to plan for the future in a way
[52:49.520 --> 53:01.280]  that, you know, what was the old saying? A delight in, I don't know, surprise and delight. You know,
[53:01.280 --> 53:08.080]  they were always able to surprise and delight. And I just don't see that. I see Facebook as being
[53:08.080 --> 53:14.800]  like the CES. You know, CES would have products that never, ever came to fruition because
[53:14.800 --> 53:18.160]  companies were just throwing stuff out there to see what would happen.
[53:18.800 --> 53:27.200]  But I see Apple as being, they're trying to be responsible, but they're also trying to have
[53:27.200 --> 53:33.440]  some of the surprise and delight that will put products out there. And you asked earlier if,
[53:33.440 --> 53:42.640]  you know, the executive team is where it should be. And I think it is because, you know,
[53:42.640 --> 53:51.280]  Apple is looking at least five years out, right, you know, for products. So is Apple still pushing
[53:51.280 --> 54:00.880]  things forward? Well, I think the Mac is certainly pushing the envelope of computing way beyond
[54:00.880 --> 54:07.120]  where the PC industry is. So that was a huge change. Making their own chips for the Mac
[54:07.120 --> 54:14.240]  was a massive change because it had software implications, it has developer implications,
[54:15.120 --> 54:23.200]  and they made a massive change. So that alone shows me that they are looking towards the future
[54:23.200 --> 54:26.800]  and they're not worried about what's going on right now.
[54:26.800 --> 54:32.960]  I've mentioned this, but isn't the most amazing thing about that, the fact that they clearly
[54:32.960 --> 54:41.840]  didn't have to do it, right? Because if they don't pursue Apple Silicon for the Mac and move
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.720]  the Mac to their own Silicon platform, then what would they have done? Well, they would have just
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.720]  stuck with Intel and x86. And what performance would they have? They would have the same
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.880]  they would have the same performance as the rest of the industry, because that was that's,
[54:56.880 --> 55:03.040]  that is the industry, right? So they didn't, you know, they could totally differentiate the Mac
[55:03.040 --> 55:10.240]  purely by the operating system alone, which is what effectively they did ever since they
[55:10.240 --> 55:17.920]  went to Intel in 2006, right? That the whole story was, okay, we give up, we're not going to
[55:17.920 --> 55:23.920]  do this power PC thing anymore, we'll just go Intel, and we'll use PC graphic cards, and
[55:25.200 --> 55:31.280]  we'll just design better enclosures and compete on on the platform. They didn't have to do it.
[55:32.320 --> 55:41.680]  It's this incredible amount of work that they've really executed. Just so deftly, like nobody,
[55:41.680 --> 55:48.960]  I, everybody knows people now, especially now that the new M1 Pro and M1 Macs.
[55:50.640 --> 55:56.480]  MacBooks are out there. I know people who were holding out and it was like the longest year of
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.120]  their life. Number one, because number one, it was a terrible year, right? It was a pandemic year,
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.440]  we're all locked in. So it was a long year for that. But I, you know, everybody has friends who
[56:05.440 --> 56:12.560]  who were like, a year ago did not buy the initial M1 MacBook Pro, because they're like, I'm going
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.920]  to wait for the real Pro Pro MacBook Pro. Yep. And I'll wait, you know, and maybe it'll be,
[56:17.920 --> 56:22.000]  you know, and I don't think anybody was surprised that it took a year. But it was a long year,
[56:22.000 --> 56:28.560]  because everybody's looking at these benchmarks from these, you know, $999 MacBook Airs that are
[56:28.560 --> 56:42.960]  blowing away, you know, $4,000 PC rigs. Everybody knows it, that now that people are adopting the
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.560]  Apple Silicon Macs, it is, it continues to blow people's minds, even though it's like year old
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.560]  news. They're like, you know, I know, everybody's been bragging about this for a year, but I didn't
[56:52.560 --> 57:00.320]  have it until now. And holy crap, now my, my shit runs really fast. Absolutely. I was one of the
[57:00.320 --> 57:09.120]  ones that went out and got one, I got a MacBook Air and one. Yeah, incredible. It's, it's absolutely,
[57:09.120 --> 57:21.360]  you know, you know, but it, it's like you said, though, it's, it shows their commitment to it,
[57:21.360 --> 57:26.560]  and that they're not sitting on their heels as the iPhone company. Yeah.
[57:51.360 --> 57:58.960]  known to the world. And you can do everything from register a unique domain name,

[58:44.160 --> 58:52.320]  Okay. And it's funny, because Apple is a very secretive company, right. And and this has been
[58:52.320 --> 58:58.080]  always been true, they they keep their powder dry until they're ready to fire it, right.
[59:00.080 --> 59:05.760]  But we do kind of know when they're working on things, right, like, like, before the iPhone
[59:05.760 --> 59:09.760]  came out, nobody knew what it was going to look like it blew us away, everybody sort of
[59:09.760 --> 59:14.320]  a lot of people were thinking it was going to be an iPod phone, which would have made sense,
[59:14.320 --> 59:22.320]  I would have bought it, I would have bought an iPod phone. Sure. But But you can't start making
[59:22.320 --> 59:28.720]  a cell phone and go to the major carriers and not have the news leak out in some degree, right? Like
[59:28.720 --> 59:33.600]  there was a general sense that, hey, everybody, nobody knows what it is, but Apple's working on
[59:33.600 --> 59:39.440]  a phone. And it was the same thing with the iPad, where it was like, I don't know what they're doing
[59:39.440 --> 59:44.720]  is it like a cut down Mac? Is it a scaled up iPhone, but they're doing a tablet,
[59:44.720 --> 59:51.520]  right? And everybody knew they were doing a tablet. At this moment, everybody quote unquote
[59:51.520 --> 59:56.720]  knows Apple's doing two things. They're working on AR VR, which may or may not be two different
[59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.600]  products, right? AR meaning like glasses, you just normally see through that project a heads up
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:10.720]  display, VR, meaning complete occlusion of your visual field and some kind of high resolution
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:21.520]  thing. And, of course, the other thing is the car. AR and VR seem like Apple is arguably the best
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:29.360]  suited company to make the first Oh, this is the way that product supposed to be right. And then
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:36.960]  we're all going to be like, Oh yeah, duh. That was the way it was supposed to be the car. I'm I
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:43.200]  continue to think I'm not trying to sell them short. I'm just saying I don't get it. I don't
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.040]  get what app, what business Apple has in that market. And I'm curious what you think. So
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:01:01.520]  if I look at the car, I try and think about where Apple could be best. And I keep coming back
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:10.320]  to the software and the hardware to make that software work. And that, to me, doesn't
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:20.000]  spell a, you know, a physical car, it's a system. And I'm not sure, you know, if does Apple really
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.560]  want to get into the car manufacturing business? I can't imagine they do. Or the licensing business,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.080]  right? And there's a lot of people who keep tossing that out. And I know that a lot of the,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.200]  I mean, we're talking five, six years of rumors, right? Right. But there's, you know, been a lot
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.560]  of speculation over the various resets that Project Titan has had over the years that Apple
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:53.600]  might just be making effectively an operating system for a car. That, in theory, it sounds like
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:00.000]  something somebody should make. It absolutely sounds like something Microsoft should be in
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.240]  advanced stages on, right? Maybe Google too. It does not sound at all like the type of thing Apple
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.760]  ever has done, ever should do, right? They're not a company that licenses operating systems.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:24.320]  And the brief time that they did in that 25-year-ago period when you were writing Mac
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:33.920]  Central, right? I mean, that was chief Mac clone era. It was a disaster for the company financially.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.560]  Yeah. They were licensing copies of the operating system for $25 or something like that, as opposed
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:49.920]  to selling $4,000 computers with a 30% profit margin. Yeah. I don't get the car thing. And
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.840]  the other thing that scares me, like if I were Tim Cook, is I don't see where the whole car market is
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:10.400]  going. It feels to me, and maybe it's like I said before, that I live in a city, I walk most days,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:17.040]  very seldom drive my car. I don't have to drive my car. But the other thing, my wife and I have
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:24.320]  been talking about it lately. Philadelphia is a very old city, one of the oldest here in North
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.040]  America. But there were some pictures from right around the corner from us from like 100 years ago
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.840]  before cars took over. And it's like, there are streets here that you think like, that's kind of
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.280]  a narrow street, you kind of have to, you know, maybe you want to slow down driving down the
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.280]  street. But it's because we have parking on both sides of the street. And if you just got rid of
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.480]  the parked cars, which like this picture from like 100 years ago shows you what this exact street
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:55.840]  looked like before cars were parked. It was like, hey, this is actually a very wide street. We're
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:03.600]  kind of moving to that sort of, not that nobody's going to own a car, but a lot fewer people will
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:11.600]  own a car and will just use ride sharing. And it's way more efficient because instead of having all
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.800]  of these cars that are parked for 23 hours a day, we could have these cars that are, you know,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.880]  mostly in use all the time and taking people places. That doesn't sound like a business
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.320]  Apple would want to get into. There's obviously money to be made for some people in that market,
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:37.040]  but like selling the type of cars that a ride sharing service would use for robot driven,
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.960]  let's just say, you know, let's say they pull it off with the self-driving, you know, you don't
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000]  have to have a human being at the wheel. You could just get into a robot car and say, you know,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:58.560]  take me to Target or take me to Trader Joe's. That doesn't seem like a business for Apple,
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.480]  right? A stylish AR VR glasses that people will use and maybe replace their phones with.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.360]  That sound sounds to me like the future Apple. And, and I mean, I'm going to turn this around
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.800]  on the end in a second, but there's also, don't forget the liability aspects of stuff like that.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.840]  Right. Which is humongous, right?
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:26.320]  That would be just, I mean, we talked about optics earlier. This isn't optics. This will be
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:34.800]  real stuff, especially, and forgive me if I say something wrong here, but in a litigious society
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.760]  like America, people will be looking to sue the shit out of Apple at every turn. And if there's
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.880]  robot cars out there, you can bet that people are going to want to sue them for whatever they
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:54.880]  can get. So I'm not sure that they can do that. So in turning it around on you, if we know that
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:04.880]  Apple is, they are actually Project Titan is a thing, and they've had several high ranking people
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:11.840]  at Apple working on this project, if it's not a car and it's not licensing a software system,
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:19.120]  what do you think it is? So it's funny that you would go there. So here's the thing. Do you have
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:26.880]  a Roomba? No. So we do. We have the Roomba. You know what the Roomba is, right? Yeah. I'm the
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:38.800]  Roomba. He's a little saucer shaped vacuum, but he's a robot. And we have him in our powder room
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.080]  off the kitchen. And every day at like five in the morning, I forget what time my wife has him
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:51.200]  set. I call him him, you know, and then he wakes up, he wakes up and then he's got like a mental
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:58.640]  map. You can like use the Roomba app to see the Roombas map of your house, what they think it is.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:09.600]  It's a fabulous idea. And the Roomba absolutely sucks. I mean, he is really, he's so dumb.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:16.480]  He is the worst robot you'd ever, you could ever imagine. But he's so bad that I have tremendous
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.320]  sympathy for him. Where like I'll come down in the morning to make coffee and I look and there
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:28.480]  he is. He got lost under the dining room table, right? No, it happens. It absolutely happens.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.640]  And there he is. And I feel bad for him because he was like, there he was like vacuuming up crumbs
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:42.640]  all around our house. But then he got under our dining room table and it just ran his battery out
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.720]  trying to get out from under the table and he couldn't do it. And then I pick him up,
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.200]  you know, and he's like a little, like having a little sick puppy. And then I take him into the
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.680]  powder room and put him on his charger. And then he makes a little a bloop, bloop noise like,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:07.360]  hey, I'm charging up. It's a clear though, but I have heard, you know, Tim Cook is sort of coy when
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.560]  he talks about the future. You know, he's not, obviously he's a super smart guy and he's not
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.040]  going to be tricked into spilling the beans on anything that he doesn't want to reveal.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.760]  But I remember a couple of years before the Apple Watch, somebody was asking like, hey,
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.400]  you know, and again, like we said, like, we kind of know what Apple's working on. Like,
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.920]  we kind of knew they were working on a watch thing before we knew what it was going to be.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.920]  And what I remember Tim Cook saying was the wrist is an interesting location to us. And
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.600]  whoever was interviewing him was like, whoa, whoa, you actually said something interesting there.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.000]  And then they were like, tell us more. And he's like, no, no, that's it. The wrist is interesting.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.160]  That's all I have to say. But it said a lot. And it turns out it was very interesting to them.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:01.760]  I've heard Tim Cook talk about this and he does talk about cars and people ask about it. All he'll
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.720]  say, though, is that autonomy is interesting, something to that effect. And what makes me
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.960]  think about where Apple might be going with Project Titan is not just, you know, robot
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:23.840]  vacuums, but clearly, five years from now, maybe too soon. But like, by the time you and I are like,
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.960]  ready to like, hang it up and retire, will we have robots who can go to the fridge and get us a
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:37.360]  Heineken? You know, like, maybe, right? You'll be able to say to some sort of dingus in your house,
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:44.400]  hey, dingus, go get me a beer. And the dingus, you know, a little robot can like go out to your
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.640]  kitchen and maybe get you a beer or something like that, or get you a paper towel or whatever you
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:57.040]  need. That seems feasible. And that is autonomy. And is it that different programming-wise as
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:05.520]  opposed to making a car, except that the risks are so much lower, right? Like, so like, if you
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:12.880]  had like a smart Apple robot who could like, you know, vacuum up crumbs and go get you a beverage
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.440]  from the fridge, what's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe it like falls down the stairs or
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.560]  something, right? As opposed to a car, where the worst thing that happens is you get in a terrible
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:32.240]  car crash and a human being gets hurt. So you're saying that these are its autonomous devices as
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:41.120]  opposed to a vehicle? Right. That's just as a spitball idea that maybe where Apple might be
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.720]  going. And obviously somebody's going to make these things, right? I mean, there's no question.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.320]  I mean, again, go back to laziness. It's a virtue. We are a lazy species. We are going
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.320]  to make robots that do as much work as we can possibly trick them into doing, right? I mean,
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.560]  we're going to do it. It's just a question of, is it a five-year thing, a 10-year thing,
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:15.760]  a 20-year thing? Yeah, no. And I don't think that we know where Apple is going to take all
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.600]  this technology. But, you know, the way that you put it is very interesting because we've always
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.560]  said this about patents too. Don't think that because Apple filed for a patent that this is
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:32.080]  going to be a new feature or a new product. It could be something that they just have out there.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.560]  It could be something that they're going to integrate into another product, you know, software
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.840]  or hardware. So it makes perfect sense, I guess, in that light that, yeah, they could do that with
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:50.720]  this. If Apple turned every patent into a product, Apple stores would be like as big as an Ikea.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.560]  Yeah. Right. And you'd have like this cavernous Raiders of the Lost Ark style warehouse down,
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  you know, with thousands and thousands and thousands of products, you know?
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:11.200]  Yeah, absolutely true. But I really do. I don't know. There's something I can't shake about the
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:18.560]  fact that Apple at its best makes personal computers. And I know that, you know, we've
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:27.520]  had this term PC for 30 years, 40 years, but it still is true though. They're personal computers.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:34.640]  And the more personal, the better Apple is at it, right? That's why the watch is such a
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.720]  sneak hit, right? Where it just sort of, everybody was like, Hey, this thing's a flop. Nobody wants
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.360]  it. And now it's like, you can't even get your hands on them for Christmas. They're, you know,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  everybody wants an Apple watch because it's super personal. It's on your wrist. It is a statement
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:58.400]  of personal style. I think cars are getting less personal. Whereas like the 20th century model,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.160]  like when you and I grew up, like your car said something about you and, you know, you'd pick a
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.720]  style of car or color of car that, that was like a personal statement. I think we're moving away
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:17.840]  from that where your car is just a rectangular box that gets you from A to B and a robot drives it.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:26.320]  Yep. No, I think you're absolutely right. I mean, the car back in our days, when we were
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:33.360]  starting to drive, it really did say something about you. But yeah, now it's more, I mean,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.160]  if anything, a car is probably a political statement now, whether you have electric or
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:48.240]  hybrid or, you know, a big gas guzzling thing. But yeah, it doesn't, it's more of a tool,
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:56.160]  a utility thing now. I don't drive a whole lot anymore. I mean, I live in, you know,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:06.560]  suburb in California, but I don't drive as much as what I used to. So the devices that I have,
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.840]  you know, you mentioned the watch, I'd even put Apple TV in there as being a personal thing,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.200]  the way that you use that. But the watch is so personal. It's on my wrist all day long.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:23.360]  And I love it. I use it for sleep tracking now. So I actually, I'm actually charging it right now
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.480]  while I'm doing this with you so that it'll be ready for tonight and track my sleep. I track
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.680]  my sleep every night with it. You know, it's got the safety features for heart and, you know,
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.600]  it doesn't get more personal than that. It's actually, you know, warning you or helping you
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.320]  with your heart rate and tracking all of that stuff. I love my watch.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:52.320]  Right. And, you know, it, to me, that's where they're going is, is just go by the number of
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:58.400]  human senses, right? Like, so we've got air pods in our ears. We've got the watch on our wrist
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:06.240]  that's monitoring our pulse and et cetera. The eyes are next, right? It just feels to me,
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.320]  and in terms of what we'll be talking about when you're on my show five years from now,
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.400]  way more likely to me that we're talking about some kind of product that goes in front of our
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.560]  eyes or multiple products if AR and VR remain separate than the car thing. That's just,
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.360]  that's just what I think. I just can't shake that feeling.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.400]  Yeah. Well, and I, they're going to keep going, you know,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.240]  Jim, I'm going to wrap up. It's it's I, I, I, I really appreciate it that you took time out
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.480]  of your holiday weekend. Cause I know you're a busy man. I love talking to you. This it's
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:48.000]  always so much fun. I can't wait to see you, right? Don't you feel like where it, it it's
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.800]  like that scene in Indiana Jones and the last crusade when he's got his finger on the Holy
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.200]  Grail and it could just roll it a little bit. And his dad, Sean Connery is like, let it go.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.800]  It's like, but I feel like we're that close to getting back to actually going to press events
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.200]  again. Yeah. It it's crazy how long it's been since you and I have seen each other because we
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:15.040]  always take time at these events to hang out a little bit. Yep. I know it is. I can't wait to
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:23.440]  see you again. Be fun. All right. Have a good rest of your holiday weekend. All right. You too.
