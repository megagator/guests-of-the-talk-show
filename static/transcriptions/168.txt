[00:00.280 --> 00:01.760]  Oh shit, I'm so stupid.
[00:04.760 --> 00:06.040]  Oh, it's not that stupid.
[00:06.040 --> 00:09.620]  But I am starting a new thing
[00:09.620 --> 00:11.820]  where I'm just sharing an Apple note
[00:11.820 --> 00:13.920]  with whoever's on the show.
[00:13.920 --> 00:17.460]  And then you can just paste, we can paste links in there.
[00:17.460 --> 00:18.940]  I like it.
[00:18.940 --> 00:22.120]  Right now all it just says is TTS 168 Serenity Caldwell.
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.280]  Anyway, the stupid thing is that I was trying to do it
[00:25.280 --> 00:27.400]  and I'm like, why can I not do this?
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.400]  I know I've done it already
[00:28.400 --> 00:30.160]  and it's because I'm staring at a Mac
[00:30.160 --> 00:32.680]  that's still running El Capitan.
[00:32.680 --> 00:34.440]  Oh no.
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.640]  So I've got to do it from my phone.
[00:36.640 --> 00:40.020]  Ugh, such technology problems.
[00:40.020 --> 00:40.880]  Did you get this?
[00:40.880 --> 00:41.720]  Did you get it?
[00:41.720 --> 00:42.560]  Yes I did.
[00:42.560 --> 00:43.400]  Anyway, it's a new feature.
[00:43.400 --> 00:44.220]  Let's see if it'll open.
[00:44.220 --> 00:45.600]  So we're sharing, we are sharing, this is my new thing.
[00:45.600 --> 00:47.760]  We can't even tell people on the air, it's not a secret.
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.760]  But I've shared a note from Apple Notes with Serenity
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.460]  so that we could paste links
[00:54.460 --> 00:56.920]  and maybe I'll remember to put all the links
[00:56.920 --> 00:59.920]  in the show notes that I say that I want.
[00:59.920 --> 01:02.040]  Seems like a perfect use of the shared note feature.
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.040]  But before we started recording,
[01:04.040 --> 01:06.560]  I spent a minute staring at my screen,
[01:06.560 --> 01:08.040]  trying to figure out how to do it.
[01:08.040 --> 01:09.840]  And it was because I'm staring at a machine
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.920]  that's still running a Mac running El Cap
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.920]  which doesn't have the feature.
[01:13.920 --> 01:15.700]  Where is my collaborate button?
[01:15.700 --> 01:17.000]  Where has it gone to?
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.480]  I am, we have so much to talk about.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.520]  I don't know how the hell we're gonna do it.
[01:20.520 --> 01:23.160]  But I'm excited, here's what I'm excited about.
[01:23.160 --> 01:25.380]  My last show was with Jim Dalrymple
[01:25.380 --> 01:26.800]  and everything was still new.
[01:26.800 --> 01:29.840]  And I feel like the phone's in the watch.
[01:29.840 --> 01:31.680]  And I don't think Sierra was out yet.
[01:33.240 --> 01:35.320]  I like talking about these things more
[01:35.320 --> 01:37.600]  once I've gotten to know them a little better.
[01:37.600 --> 01:39.440]  Like I even said on my show the last time,
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.000]  I found writing a review of the iPhone after five days
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.240]  to be incredibly stressful.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.060]  Because I don't know what I've-
[01:44.060 --> 01:44.900]  It's really hard.
[01:44.900 --> 01:47.080]  Right, so I'm anxious to hear your thoughts
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.760]  now that we've starting to settle in
[01:48.760 --> 01:51.560]  with these new devices and both new operating systems.
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.740]  But what I was gonna tell you is I'm like a reckless,
[01:55.740 --> 01:57.560]  I'm reckless with my iOS devices.
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.680]  I'll install the first beta of whatever's coming out
[02:01.680 --> 02:04.440]  as soon as somebody else on Twitter says they installed it
[02:04.440 --> 02:06.560]  and it didn't blow up.
[02:06.560 --> 02:07.840]  Oh yeah, same.
[02:07.840 --> 02:10.360]  So my iPhone, my personal iPhone is already running
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.280]  the developer beta of 10.1 because who cares?
[02:15.280 --> 02:17.600]  Is your personal iPhone a seven plus this time around
[02:17.600 --> 02:18.640]  or just a seven? No, it's a seven.
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.360]  I've just switched, I think Saturday I switched
[02:22.360 --> 02:26.280]  from my plus review unit to the phone
[02:26.280 --> 02:27.620]  I ended up buying for myself,
[02:27.620 --> 02:29.940]  which is jet black regular seven.
[02:31.960 --> 02:34.880]  But I had to run the beta because I put the beta
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.520]  on the plus so I could take portrait mode photos.
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.480]  And then once you've upgraded that device,
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.780]  I wanted to keep carrying forward that backup and restore
[02:44.780 --> 02:46.320]  so I have all my stuff and don't have to set up
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.200]  my email accounts and everything again.
[02:48.200 --> 02:49.560]  So I have to be running the beta here.
[02:49.560 --> 02:52.840]  But I find the iOS betas to be just fine.
[02:52.840 --> 02:54.680]  Yeah, they've been remarkably stable.
[02:54.680 --> 02:57.920]  I think the entire iOS 10 beta release cycle
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.560]  has been remarkably stable.
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.040]  I installed two days after WWDC for running the dev beta
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.680]  and I have not had problems since.
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.580]  Like little things here and there, little problems, but.
[03:09.580 --> 03:12.420]  But on my Macs, I tend to be very conservative.
[03:12.420 --> 03:15.720]  I don't run the developer betas over the summer
[03:15.720 --> 03:19.520]  and I've upgraded my MacBook,
[03:19.520 --> 03:21.380]  which I don't really use that much.
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.200]  Or at least I haven't been
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.840]  because I haven't been traveling lately.
[03:24.840 --> 03:27.080]  So I did install Sierra on that one,
[03:27.080 --> 03:30.720]  but I'm not, my iMac at my desk, I'm waiting.
[03:30.720 --> 03:32.160]  I am exactly the same.
[03:32.160 --> 03:34.840]  I did not install Sierra on this iMac
[03:34.840 --> 03:37.480]  until the day after release because our,
[03:37.480 --> 03:39.320]  thankfully we have a staff at iMore now,
[03:39.320 --> 03:40.380]  which is really lovely.
[03:40.380 --> 03:42.760]  And Lori Gill kind of took point
[03:42.760 --> 03:44.760]  on all of the macOS Sierra coverage,
[03:44.760 --> 03:46.500]  which meant I didn't have to worry about it.
[03:46.500 --> 03:49.000]  So I had like seven devices,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.680]  like seven iOS devices running iOS 10
[03:51.680 --> 03:54.600]  and no Macs in the house running Sierra.
[03:54.600 --> 03:56.240]  I just typed uptime in the terminal.
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.600]  So my iMac's been up for 23 days without a restart.
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.000]  And I find that to be very typical.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.500]  Like I just come in here every day
[04:03.500 --> 04:05.700]  and just hit the keyboard to wake it up.
[04:05.700 --> 04:07.120]  There are features I'm looking forward to.
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.800]  I can't wait to get the thing
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.400]  where I can log in with my Apple Watch.
[04:11.400 --> 04:12.720]  Auto unlock, yeah.
[04:12.720 --> 04:13.840]  That's been kind of fun.
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.420]  I've enjoyed that the last four days.
[04:15.420 --> 04:17.920]  So maybe by the next episode I record,
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.240]  I will be running Sierra here.
[04:19.240 --> 04:22.280]  And it does seem, it seemed to me on my MacBook
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.100]  where I did upgrade to Sierra,
[04:24.100 --> 04:29.100]  that it was the least inconvenient,
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.280]  major version of macOS 10 upgrade I've ever done.
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.080]  It seemed to me like almost nothing broke or changed.
[04:37.080 --> 04:39.000]  Yeah, I have had no problems.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.320]  Granted, I haven't launched an Adobe program yet.
[04:41.320 --> 04:43.360]  So Photoshop still could be completely borked
[04:43.360 --> 04:44.960]  and I wouldn't know it.
[04:44.960 --> 04:46.360]  But I'm pretty sure,
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.640]  I haven't heard any complaining from my artist friends.
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.720]  So I haven't really run into anything major
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.000]  where it's just completely broken or completely a pain.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.220]  Yeah, one of the reasons I'm so conservative upgrading a Mac
[04:55.220 --> 04:58.320]  is that I have so many little super nerdy things
[04:58.320 --> 04:59.960]  that I install and set up.
[04:59.960 --> 05:01.480]  Like I have custom,
[05:01.480 --> 05:02.640]  like I have a bunch of scripts
[05:02.640 --> 05:04.080]  I've written for myself in Perl,
[05:04.080 --> 05:05.720]  and they require Perl modules
[05:05.720 --> 05:08.140]  from the CPAN open source repository.
[05:08.140 --> 05:10.120]  And you just type some things on the command line
[05:10.120 --> 05:11.120]  and install them.
[05:11.120 --> 05:12.920]  And every time, to my memory,
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.800]  every time I've ever done a major upgrade of macOS 10,
[05:17.080 --> 05:18.200]  I've had to reinstall those
[05:18.200 --> 05:21.120]  because Perl's considered part of the system.
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.120]  Oh yeah, that would make sense.
[05:23.120 --> 05:24.960]  It's just, I accept it.
[05:24.960 --> 05:26.040]  It makes sense to me.
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.360]  But then this time I didn't have to.
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.280]  All the stuff I had installed from CPAN was still there.
[05:31.280 --> 05:34.440]  They finally, the macOS engineers listened to you
[05:34.440 --> 05:35.400]  and said, you know what?
[05:35.400 --> 05:38.280]  We're just gonna make the Perl upgrade process
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.400]  easier this time.
[05:39.400 --> 05:41.340]  Who's our friend in the background?
[05:41.340 --> 05:43.720]  That's Olive, who I'm actually gonna go tell
[05:43.720 --> 05:45.180]  to quiet down in just a second.
[05:45.180 --> 05:47.200]  There's a new puppy in the back fence
[05:47.200 --> 05:49.280]  that she gets really excited about.
[05:49.280 --> 05:51.160]  I like having a dog on the show.
[05:51.160 --> 05:53.800]  Oh yeah, it gives it a little bit of a color.
[05:53.800 --> 05:55.880]  People got very mad at me last week.
[05:55.880 --> 05:57.280]  I said, I don't like cats.
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.840]  I am an equal opportunity pet lover.
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.480]  We have two dogs and one cat in this house.
[06:03.480 --> 06:04.300]  There we go.
[06:04.300 --> 06:06.420]  That brings balance to the talk show
[06:06.420 --> 06:07.760]  so people can stop complaining.
[06:07.760 --> 06:09.560]  And then the problem was that Jim-
[06:09.560 --> 06:10.400]  Balance to the force touch.
[06:10.400 --> 06:12.840]  The problem was that Jim Dalrymple agreed with me.
[06:12.840 --> 06:13.840]  Oh no.
[06:14.840 --> 06:15.840]  Nothing against dogs.
[06:15.840 --> 06:18.520]  Dogs are great, but I grew up with cats, all cats.
[06:18.520 --> 06:20.920]  And then my fiance owns dogs.
[06:20.920 --> 06:23.760]  So it's been a kind of like a merging of the households.
[06:23.760 --> 06:24.600]  Well, there we go.
[06:24.600 --> 06:26.600]  I think the last time we had a dog barking
[06:26.600 --> 06:28.720]  in the background of the show was Joanna Stern
[06:28.720 --> 06:31.240]  when she had her dog was a puppy.
[06:31.240 --> 06:33.400]  And I think had an accident in the room
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.560]  while she was on the show.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.680]  Oh no.
[06:35.680 --> 06:36.960]  Comic gold.
[06:36.960 --> 06:37.780]  Yep, yep.
[06:37.780 --> 06:42.120]  I was like, okay, let's talk about MacBooks, oh wait, wait.
[06:42.120 --> 06:42.960]  I don't know.
[06:42.960 --> 06:47.120]  So it seems to me like Apple has their upgrade mojo in place
[06:47.120 --> 06:49.780]  and it just scanning the internets.
[06:49.780 --> 06:52.620]  It seems like there were relatively few people
[06:52.620 --> 06:55.160]  who's seemingly on Twitter had any kind of problem
[06:55.160 --> 06:58.720]  upgrading either to iOS 10 or to Sierra.
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.880]  Yeah, and honestly, this is probably
[07:00.880 --> 07:03.800]  when one of the smoother upgrade cycles
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.620]  that I've seen on the Twitter webs.
[07:08.620 --> 07:10.160]  The only thing I've really seen complaints about
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.300]  are the home button.
[07:11.300 --> 07:13.160]  And even those have kind of tapered off
[07:13.160 --> 07:14.600]  after the first couple days.
[07:14.600 --> 07:16.720]  They're the outrages of like,
[07:16.720 --> 07:18.880]  why doesn't my slide to unlock work?
[07:18.880 --> 07:20.440]  And even my personal trainer,
[07:20.440 --> 07:22.360]  when I went to see her last week,
[07:22.360 --> 07:25.200]  she was very outraged at the idea
[07:25.200 --> 07:28.000]  of having to change her unlock behavior.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.880]  And then when I saw her the next week,
[07:29.880 --> 07:32.600]  she's like, yeah, I've gotten used to it, it's fine.
[07:32.600 --> 07:33.860]  That's an interesting change
[07:33.860 --> 07:36.320]  because it's one that I've heard that too
[07:36.320 --> 07:38.060]  from real people.
[07:40.280 --> 07:43.660]  And what I recall is I think I started running
[07:43.660 --> 07:46.520]  the second developer beta, maybe the third,
[07:46.520 --> 07:48.560]  because I was traveling in early July
[07:48.560 --> 07:51.520]  and I didn't want to take a chance while I was traveling.
[07:51.520 --> 07:53.800]  So as soon as we got home from a trip in July,
[07:53.800 --> 07:55.820]  that's when I started running the developer betas
[07:55.820 --> 07:56.960]  on my iPhone.
[07:56.960 --> 08:00.200]  And at first, like anybody else, I was confused.
[08:00.200 --> 08:05.160]  It seemed like getting past the lock screen was weird.
[08:05.160 --> 08:07.800]  And I just thought, what I remember thinking was,
[08:07.800 --> 08:10.080]  ah, it's a beta, I'm sure they'll figure this out
[08:10.080 --> 08:11.580]  by the end of the summer.
[08:11.580 --> 08:12.420]  And they didn't really,
[08:12.420 --> 08:13.960]  I don't think they actually changed anything.
[08:13.960 --> 08:18.080]  It's just that eventually it became the new normal to me.
[08:18.080 --> 08:19.920]  Yeah, you get comfortable with it
[08:19.920 --> 08:22.200]  and then you switch back to a device running iOS 9
[08:22.200 --> 08:24.320]  and you're like, why won't you,
[08:24.320 --> 08:26.800]  I'm just, I'm trying to unlock you.
[08:26.800 --> 08:29.400]  Yeah, and it just seems normal now.
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.080]  Although I guess it's, I guess it's,
[08:32.080 --> 08:35.280]  are there still a lot of people who don't have touch ID?
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.880]  I don't think there are a ton of people
[08:36.880 --> 08:38.360]  who don't have touch ID,
[08:38.360 --> 08:41.600]  but the, like my personal trainer who I was talking to,
[08:41.600 --> 08:43.960]  she's like, I've never put a passcode on my iPhone.
[08:43.960 --> 08:45.600]  And immediately I told her, well,
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.880]  here are the reasons why you should put a passcode
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.600]  and touch ID on your iPhone.
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.320]  But there are a lot of people who still don't do passcodes
[08:52.320 --> 08:54.480]  and don't do touch ID despite having touch ID
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.040]  enabled iPhones, which boggles my mind.
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.200]  It's so easy.
[08:58.200 --> 08:59.040]  That would be an interest.
[08:59.040 --> 09:00.000]  I have a wonder what that is.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.880]  I've always thought, and I think,
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.760]  I do think it's true that the original slide to unlock,
[09:07.680 --> 09:10.440]  which, you know, Apple bragged about,
[09:10.440 --> 09:14.080]  it was a big part of the original iPhone presentation.
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.440]  It was a part of the ads.
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.680]  It was a part of the brand.
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.480]  It was actually a big part of their lawsuits with Samsung.
[09:21.480 --> 09:23.800]  I forget, I think they sued other people too, right?
[09:23.800 --> 09:25.240]  And it was, it was held up.
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.040]  It was like Apple's version of Amazon's one-click, you know,
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.280]  like this is a ridiculous thing to be able to patent.
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.000]  No, this is actually genius.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.440]  You know, arguments on both sides should be able
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.920]  to patent an idea that's so simple, blah, blah, blah.
[09:37.920 --> 09:38.920]  I really do think though,
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.240]  that that feature was designed for a phone
[09:42.240 --> 09:44.160]  that doesn't have a passcode.
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.560]  Oh yeah.
[09:45.560 --> 09:48.960]  I mean, it was designed in kind of the pre-passcode era
[09:48.960 --> 09:52.480]  where I don't think until my iPhone 4
[09:52.480 --> 09:54.620]  that I really ever thought about having passcodes
[09:54.620 --> 09:56.680]  on my devices or thought seriously
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.000]  about like what it meant to protect the information
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.280]  that was on my device.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.360]  Because the iPhone 3G and 3GS,
[10:03.360 --> 10:05.640]  I feel like all I had on those phones
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.720]  were like Twitter and the camera app.
[10:09.720 --> 10:10.600]  And I wasn't, you know,
[10:10.600 --> 10:13.060]  taking any pictures that were particularly sensitive
[10:13.060 --> 10:15.220]  and I wasn't doing a ton of banking on my phone
[10:15.220 --> 10:17.960]  because 3G networks at that point were still slow.
[10:17.960 --> 10:21.000]  But now, I mean, you know, my 7 Plus,
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.040]  I feel like I can pretty much do my entire job on it.
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.320]  I don't need a computer for some things.
[10:28.320 --> 10:30.120]  No, I think that's definitely true.
[10:30.120 --> 10:31.280]  Yeah.
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.720]  That's why I hear it from so many people.
[10:33.720 --> 10:36.360]  But I just think we just didn't, I don't know,
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.920]  the whole industry, both on the company's side,
[10:40.920 --> 10:44.120]  like Apple's side as the creator of this device
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.920]  and this operating system and on the consumer side
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.840]  and on our side as people who write about this stuff,
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.440]  the last decade has been a real eye-opener
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.120]  in terms of privacy and security.
[10:56.120 --> 10:58.400]  I think before that, we really only thought of security
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.800]  as security that goes through bugs.
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.720]  Like, oh, there's an exploit in Windows XP
[11:05.720 --> 11:08.200]  and all you have to do is visit this website
[11:08.200 --> 11:11.960]  and code can get run locally with full privileges
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.880]  on your computer and you're in trouble.
[11:13.880 --> 11:15.080]  And that's what we thought of it as.
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.280]  As opposed to just the privacy aspects of this system,
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.120]  it doesn't have any bugs, it's working as designed,
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.400]  but if somebody picks up your phone
[11:24.400 --> 11:25.520]  and plugs it into iTunes,
[11:25.520 --> 11:28.320]  they'll just be able to see all your stuff, you know?
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.160]  Yeah.
[11:30.240 --> 11:33.760]  Yeah, and it's, I mean, the scary thing about that
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.120]  is really the social engineering part of it,
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.120]  where even I think until really we got it with Snowden
[11:41.600 --> 11:44.680]  and we got it with even Mr. Robot of all things,
[11:44.680 --> 11:46.920]  alerting people to the idea of like,
[11:46.920 --> 11:49.160]  yeah, if people know your security questions
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.560]  or a couple of facts about you,
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.400]  they can pretty much take over your life.
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.120]  Like, I remember, do you remember Matt Honan's piece
[11:54.120 --> 11:55.400]  from a few years ago?
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.480]  Yeah, about his password dilemmas and troubles
[11:58.480 --> 12:01.080]  and how basically somebody took over all of his stuff.
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.200]  And like that kind of stuff is I think an eye-opener for,
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.400]  it definitely was an eye-opener
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.600]  for a lot of the tech concerted audience,
[12:08.600 --> 12:10.160]  but it's still, I think,
[12:10.160 --> 12:12.320]  making its way towards the general public.
[12:12.320 --> 12:14.520]  Where the general public is worried about security
[12:14.520 --> 12:16.680]  and this broad, nebulous idea,
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.080]  but they don't really think about it
[12:18.080 --> 12:20.480]  on a very discreet, you know, individual basis,
[12:20.480 --> 12:22.880]  like talking to my personal trainer.
[12:22.880 --> 12:24.880]  If someone picks up, if you go to Africa
[12:24.880 --> 12:26.880]  and someone picks up your phone,
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.800]  they could basically steal your identity, no problem.
[12:30.800 --> 12:32.240]  It's true.
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.280]  She was going to Africa.
[12:33.280 --> 12:36.560]  It's not just like random, picking Africa,
[12:36.560 --> 12:37.400]  picking on Africa.
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.840]  And I also think the iPhone and therefore iOS in particular
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.100]  also started on the wrong foot in some ways
[12:44.100 --> 12:46.760]  because it's, in some ways,
[12:46.760 --> 12:48.640]  I think Apple had conceived of it
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.640]  as much as the successor to the iPod as it was to the Mac.
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.400]  And so yes, there were some, you know,
[12:57.400 --> 13:00.000]  some aspects of whatever you want to call
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.200]  the original version of iOS.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.440]  I think it didn't even have a name.
[13:03.440 --> 13:05.400]  It was called like iPhone OS.
[13:05.400 --> 13:07.320]  iPhone OS, yeah.
[13:07.320 --> 13:08.760]  And they even had like marketing material
[13:08.760 --> 13:10.200]  that they even called it OS 10.
[13:10.200 --> 13:11.640]  It was like runs OS 10.
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.520]  You know, they didn't know what to call it at first.
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.860]  But a lot of it was sort of stripped out
[13:17.860 --> 13:20.880]  by the idea that it was sort of more like an iPod,
[13:20.880 --> 13:23.600]  which never had any real sort of security, right?
[13:23.600 --> 13:26.560]  You could always just plug an iPod into another computer
[13:26.560 --> 13:28.160]  and see what was on it.
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.080]  Well, you had DRM to music for a long time
[13:30.080 --> 13:31.960]  or you had music, it was one way transfer.
[13:31.960 --> 13:34.720]  Right, the security was really more on the format
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.080]  of the files you bought from the store
[13:37.080 --> 13:38.420]  than the device itself.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.240]  And you know, just wasn't a protected device.
[13:42.240 --> 13:44.580]  I mean, you could really just plug somebody else's iPhone
[13:44.580 --> 13:48.960]  into your Mac and communicate over USB.
[13:48.960 --> 13:51.440]  So they've obviously come a long way from there to here.
[13:51.440 --> 13:53.960]  And I do think that the slide to unlock
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.040]  just didn't really fit.
[13:56.040 --> 14:01.040]  Touch ID is slide to unlock for the modern secure world.
[14:02.500 --> 14:06.480]  Yeah, this is the easy way to open your phone
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.560]  after you've put it some level of security.
[14:09.560 --> 14:11.600]  And especially as they've rolled out touch ID
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.080]  to more places, including like on iOS 10,
[14:15.080 --> 14:16.640]  a little feature that I even noticed today
[14:16.640 --> 14:18.780]  is if you go into say Apple Music
[14:18.780 --> 14:21.000]  and you're signing into your user account,
[14:22.140 --> 14:25.100]  as long as you have touch ID enabled for iTunes,
[14:25.100 --> 14:26.820]  you can now use your fingerprint for that.
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.440]  You don't even have to enter in your password
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.320]  and like these weird random places of the OS,
[14:31.320 --> 14:34.120]  which I think was even still a thing in iOS 9
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.760]  where there were still like some areas
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.160]  where you had to type out your long complicated password.
[14:38.160 --> 14:39.440]  And now it's all like,
[14:39.440 --> 14:41.400]  as long as you're already in the system,
[14:41.400 --> 14:43.120]  you can authorize just about anything
[14:43.120 --> 14:44.980]  with a touch ID fingerprint.
[14:44.980 --> 14:47.040]  It does seem like I've had to type my passwords
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.360]  in fewer times.
[14:48.360 --> 14:52.620]  And it's one of the little things that it seems like,
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.520]  it's so annoying that we notice it
[14:55.520 --> 14:56.760]  when we're getting badgered by it
[14:56.760 --> 14:58.080]  and we yell at Apple for it.
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.080]  And then we don't really notice when they fix it.
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.680]  And so we don't get to give them the little pat on the head
[15:02.680 --> 15:04.200]  and say, thank you, Apple.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.400]  You know, the number of times where I used to have to,
[15:08.400 --> 15:10.480]  I'd just be out and I would just get prompted
[15:10.480 --> 15:12.940]  for my iCloud password.
[15:12.940 --> 15:15.080]  And it wouldn't even tell me why, right?
[15:15.080 --> 15:15.920]  It's just like a system.
[15:15.920 --> 15:17.360]  Oh, I know, it's just like this random thing.
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.840]  Right, but it does seem to me anecdotally,
[15:19.840 --> 15:20.800]  at least for me personally,
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.040]  that I don't see that as much as I, almost never.
[15:24.040 --> 15:25.640]  It's almost never inexplicable.
[15:25.640 --> 15:27.920]  It's always got like an explanation
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.920]  and therefore I don't feel bad about it.
[15:30.920 --> 15:33.080]  So good for Apple on that.
[15:33.080 --> 15:35.920]  So before we get into the details,
[15:35.920 --> 15:38.180]  while we're on this subject, let's try to,
[15:38.180 --> 15:41.440]  I have at least one, but think about the things
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.280]  that Apple still has a lot of,
[15:45.280 --> 15:48.640]  where are they falling short on their upgrade
[15:48.640 --> 15:50.440]  when you upgrade devices?
[15:50.440 --> 15:52.440]  Overall, I think they're getting really good at it.
[15:52.440 --> 15:53.760]  But I'll give one example.
[15:53.760 --> 15:56.800]  And I know this has gotta be worse for you than me
[15:56.800 --> 15:58.580]  because I think you have more Apple Watches.
[15:58.580 --> 16:01.160]  Yeah, I was gonna say, does your example involve
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.560]  upgrading to a new Apple Watch?
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.400]  Yes, and upgrading to a new Apple Watch is the worst.
[16:07.400 --> 16:09.600]  It takes forever.
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.200]  And if you forget to do it in the right order,
[16:12.200 --> 16:14.440]  you've gotta start all over from scratch.
[16:14.440 --> 16:17.760]  You just wanna, yeah, you wanna put like a, I don't know,
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.700]  a head to the desk kind of a thing.
[16:19.700 --> 16:23.320]  It's very frustrating, especially, I don't, you know,
[16:23.320 --> 16:26.320]  as people who are dealing with review units,
[16:26.320 --> 16:29.020]  having certain Apple Watches paired to certain devices
[16:29.020 --> 16:31.520]  and some of them being backups of your old phone
[16:31.520 --> 16:34.080]  and some of them not being backups of your old phone
[16:34.080 --> 16:36.020]  and then trying to switch those watches
[16:36.020 --> 16:38.400]  from one device to another is pretty much impossible,
[16:38.400 --> 16:41.480]  unless they're on your Apple ID and on your specific backup.
[16:41.480 --> 16:43.520]  They're basically tied to the phone.
[16:43.520 --> 16:46.160]  And that's the thing that like took me a while
[16:46.160 --> 16:47.960]  to wrap my head around is like,
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.400]  if your Apple Watch is not a separate device,
[16:51.400 --> 16:53.920]  it's your Apple Watch and your iPhone.
[16:53.920 --> 16:57.060]  And all of the backups get stored basically
[16:57.060 --> 16:58.280]  as your iPhone backups.
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.480]  So if you pair an Apple Watch to a brand new iPhone
[17:01.480 --> 17:03.320]  that you haven't restored from backup,
[17:03.320 --> 17:05.760]  and then you're like, oh, I wanna switch that Apple Watch
[17:05.760 --> 17:08.440]  to, you know, a backed up iPhone,
[17:08.440 --> 17:10.240]  you're gonna be in a little bit of trouble.
[17:10.240 --> 17:12.400]  You're not gonna be very happy.
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.640]  I find that the thing that gets me is the fact
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.760]  that you don't get your watch backed up
[17:18.760 --> 17:22.360]  until you unpair it from the phone.
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.520]  And that feels so wrong to me.
[17:24.520 --> 17:26.560]  And I don't see how any normal person,
[17:26.560 --> 17:29.580]  no normal person would ever, ever think
[17:29.580 --> 17:31.220]  that that's how it should be done.
[17:31.220 --> 17:33.640]  And even if they're told that that's how it's done,
[17:33.640 --> 17:37.480]  it doesn't look like you're doing the right thing.
[17:37.480 --> 17:40.320]  Like even if you're just, somebody says,
[17:40.320 --> 17:42.480]  here's what you do with your new iPhone.
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.560]  First, unpair your watch from your old phone.
[17:46.560 --> 17:47.400]  Well, and the thing is-
[17:47.400 --> 17:48.880]  Then back up your old phone.
[17:48.880 --> 17:51.400]  Then restore your new phone from that backup.
[17:51.400 --> 17:54.600]  And then your watch as you knew it will still be there.
[17:54.600 --> 17:56.120]  And then you can repair the watch
[17:56.120 --> 17:57.840]  and it'll go right back to where it was.
[17:57.840 --> 17:59.360]  But when you go through those steps,
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.640]  it doesn't look like you're doing that.
[18:01.640 --> 18:04.320]  It looks like you're erasing your watch.
[18:04.320 --> 18:08.800]  Yeah, and there's no good dialogue from that box.
[18:08.800 --> 18:10.280]  And it is, I'm pretty sure the watch
[18:10.280 --> 18:12.120]  does get backed up nightly the same way
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.680]  that the iPhone does when there's an iCloud backup.
[18:14.680 --> 18:15.520]  No, it doesn't,
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.200]  because there are intermediary backups that are made.
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.360]  However, if you want to upgrade,
[18:21.360 --> 18:23.940]  so let's say I'm going from a watch series zero
[18:23.940 --> 18:25.560]  to a watch series two,
[18:25.560 --> 18:28.460]  and I don't unpair the watch series zero
[18:28.460 --> 18:30.200]  before I go to the series two,
[18:30.200 --> 18:32.160]  the most recent backup I might find
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.800]  is it might be two, three days old.
[18:33.800 --> 18:34.700]  It's not gonna be current,
[18:34.700 --> 18:36.520]  which means you're not gonna have your move data
[18:36.520 --> 18:38.280]  and you're not gonna have your activity stuff.
[18:38.280 --> 18:39.720]  Or it might be even older
[18:39.720 --> 18:42.200]  if the backup didn't go through properly.
[18:42.200 --> 18:43.580]  And that's really frustrating,
[18:43.580 --> 18:45.040]  the fact that you can't,
[18:45.040 --> 18:48.560]  and there's no way to make a manual backup
[18:48.560 --> 18:51.000]  unless you unpair it, which you were talking about,
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.960]  which is like, that is the most frustrating thing.
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.880]  Because when people Google how to back up your watch,
[18:58.880 --> 19:00.280]  and it's not how to back up your watch,
[19:00.280 --> 19:01.880]  it's how to unpair your watch,
[19:01.880 --> 19:04.120]  which also makes a backup.
[19:04.120 --> 19:06.280]  Like, why couldn't there just be a button apple?
[19:06.280 --> 19:07.840]  Like, really?
[19:07.840 --> 19:09.320]  I don't even see how you can see
[19:09.320 --> 19:10.640]  where your latest backup is.
[19:10.640 --> 19:11.880]  I don't know that you can.
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.160]  I'm looking in there.
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.320]  The only way that you can see where your latest backup is
[19:16.320 --> 19:18.440]  is when you're pairing a new watch,
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.720]  which is really dumb.
[19:19.720 --> 19:24.160]  Because I ran into that in a weird kind of,
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.520]  where I had, this is complicated,
[19:26.520 --> 19:28.620]  I had a backup of my phone,
[19:28.620 --> 19:31.480]  or I had restored an iPhone 7 review unit
[19:31.480 --> 19:33.480]  from the regular backup of my phone.
[19:33.480 --> 19:36.080]  So it was running all of my apps and everything else.
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.080]  And then I had a watch that I was doing some activity data on
[19:41.600 --> 19:45.420]  and then I switched to my jet black iPhone 7 Plus,
[19:45.420 --> 19:46.480]  which came in.
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.280]  And the iPhone 7 Plus, I had restored from an iPhone backup,
[19:50.280 --> 19:53.960]  but I'd restored from an iPhone backup like two days prior.
[19:53.960 --> 19:58.140]  So the 7 Plus and the 7 were two days off
[19:58.140 --> 19:59.580]  in terms of backups.
[19:59.580 --> 20:03.560]  So when I got my new, my non-review Apple Watch Series 2
[20:03.560 --> 20:08.560]  and I went to pair it with the jet black iPhone 7 Plus,
[20:08.880 --> 20:11.280]  it was only showing me Apple Watch backups
[20:11.280 --> 20:13.660]  that were two days old or more,
[20:13.660 --> 20:15.520]  because it couldn't see that,
[20:15.520 --> 20:17.320]  despite the fact that these phones
[20:17.320 --> 20:19.880]  were essentially going to the same iCloud backup
[20:19.880 --> 20:22.040]  and had the same information on them
[20:22.040 --> 20:24.360]  and had the same health data even
[20:24.360 --> 20:27.000]  because of it being an iCloud,
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.680]  it couldn't see the Apple Watch backups
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.440]  that the iPhone 7 made because in iCloud's mind,
[20:33.440 --> 20:36.560]  it was an iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch combo
[20:36.560 --> 20:40.440]  and an iPhone 7 Plus, plus Apple Watch combo.
[20:40.440 --> 20:45.340]  And it's just like, it's the same iCloud account.
[20:45.340 --> 20:46.280]  It's so frustrating.
[20:46.280 --> 20:48.400]  I really hope that they put some effort into that.
[20:48.400 --> 20:50.080]  And I'm almost surprised they haven't
[20:50.080 --> 20:51.600]  because I always think like, okay,
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.680]  so when people like me and you sit here and complain
[20:55.680 --> 20:59.720]  and it's worse for us because I'm on my third iPhone 7 now.
[20:59.720 --> 21:03.360]  I had two review units and the one I bought and now own
[21:03.360 --> 21:05.240]  and only the one watch.
[21:05.240 --> 21:07.180]  I'm still wearing a review unit watch
[21:07.180 --> 21:08.740]  because I don't know what I want to buy for myself.
[21:08.740 --> 21:13.740]  But I realized that it's a tiny little violin
[21:13.880 --> 21:15.480]  that's playing sad music for us
[21:15.480 --> 21:17.040]  because we have this all these-
[21:17.040 --> 21:18.560]  We have all of these phones.
[21:18.560 --> 21:21.540]  Yeah, we have all these gadgets to play with.
[21:21.540 --> 21:23.640]  But I just can't help but think,
[21:23.640 --> 21:24.600]  and I know that they're not supposed
[21:24.600 --> 21:25.660]  to solve these problems for us
[21:25.660 --> 21:26.500]  because we're edge cases.
[21:26.500 --> 21:29.080]  But even normal people who just bought one new phone,
[21:29.080 --> 21:31.240]  it's terrible if you go through
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.320]  and didn't remember to unpair your watch first.
[21:33.320 --> 21:37.600]  Yeah, or the worst part is if you're wearing your watch
[21:37.600 --> 21:39.160]  and it's still paired to your old phone
[21:39.160 --> 21:41.440]  and you don't think about pairing it to your new phone
[21:41.440 --> 21:44.280]  until a couple days after you've had your new phone,
[21:44.280 --> 21:46.840]  which is entirely likely because people,
[21:46.840 --> 21:49.660]  again, you treat the Apple Watch as a separate device
[21:49.660 --> 21:50.560]  for a certain period.
[21:50.560 --> 21:52.640]  It was what you were saying with the first iPhone, right?
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.760]  Where it's like, they're treating the Apple Watch
[21:54.760 --> 21:56.240]  as pretty much a separate device.
[21:56.240 --> 21:59.120]  Oh, it has GPS now and you can go outside for walks
[21:59.120 --> 22:01.160]  and you leave your iPhone at home,
[22:01.160 --> 22:02.880]  but it is still tied to the iPhone.
[22:02.880 --> 22:05.520]  And that's something that's not really marketed enough
[22:05.520 --> 22:08.040]  outside of the, yeah, it uses the iPhone cellular signal.
[22:08.040 --> 22:10.360]  No, it is an iPhone accessory.
[22:10.360 --> 22:12.640]  So if it's not tied to your right iPhone,
[22:12.640 --> 22:13.860]  then everything falls apart.
[22:13.860 --> 22:16.760]  And that is something that I can see being very confusing
[22:16.760 --> 22:17.920]  for the average user
[22:17.920 --> 22:20.040]  and something that they'll just throw their hands up about.
[22:20.040 --> 22:21.820]  Well, and the thing is that surely
[22:21.820 --> 22:23.740]  there must be a lot of people inside Apple
[22:23.740 --> 22:24.840]  who go through the same thing
[22:24.840 --> 22:27.180]  because they are using test devices.
[22:27.180 --> 22:29.720]  So that's why I'm a little surprised
[22:29.720 --> 22:31.200]  that they haven't addressed this.
[22:31.200 --> 22:33.160]  I mean, and I think it's one of the reasons
[22:33.160 --> 22:36.560]  why you are now able to have multiple watches
[22:36.560 --> 22:38.700]  paired with one phone.
[22:38.700 --> 22:39.540]  Oh yeah.
[22:39.540 --> 22:42.200]  And part of it is that, of course, yeah,
[22:42.200 --> 22:43.600]  if you wanna buy a couple Apple Watches,
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.240]  Apple would love to sell you a couple.
[22:45.240 --> 22:47.440]  But I'm sure that part of the reason that it's in there
[22:47.440 --> 22:50.400]  is that some of the most likely people
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.560]  to have several Apple Watches at the same time
[22:53.560 --> 22:54.800]  are people inside Apple
[22:54.800 --> 22:57.520]  who are testing either new software
[22:57.520 --> 22:58.780]  or new hardware or both.
[22:59.640 --> 23:00.460]  Yeah.
[23:00.460 --> 23:02.120]  It's gotta get better.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.720]  It absolutely has to.
[23:03.720 --> 23:07.860]  And I mean, I'm hopeful, especially as the watch evolves,
[23:07.860 --> 23:09.800]  but it's still, it's a pain point.
[23:09.800 --> 23:12.120]  And it also seems like one thing in Siri,
[23:12.120 --> 23:13.400]  I didn't put a stopwatch to it,
[23:13.400 --> 23:17.240]  so maybe it went from really bad to sorta kinda bad.
[23:17.240 --> 23:19.580]  But the wireless network speed
[23:19.580 --> 23:22.780]  between your phone and the watch or something
[23:22.780 --> 23:25.960]  is so unbelievably slow.
[23:25.960 --> 23:27.040]  It's so painful.
[23:28.360 --> 23:32.600]  Like, I swear, I was restoring this watch after I got,
[23:33.680 --> 23:35.420]  just went through this again over the weekend
[23:35.420 --> 23:36.560]  where I had to unpair it,
[23:36.560 --> 23:38.160]  cause now I have it paired with the phone
[23:38.160 --> 23:39.300]  that I own myself.
[23:40.360 --> 23:43.160]  And I let it go for an hour and I came back to it
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.840]  and it was still on that spinning,
[23:44.840 --> 23:46.680]  that slow spinner around the outside.
[23:46.680 --> 23:47.520]  Oh no.
[23:47.520 --> 23:49.840]  And I was like, this is crazy.
[23:49.840 --> 23:52.360]  Did you restore your apps too?
[23:52.360 --> 23:54.480]  Yeah, I don't have a lot of apps on my phone.
[23:54.480 --> 23:55.920]  But even so, yeah, exactly.
[23:55.920 --> 23:57.800]  It just, it takes, when I was,
[23:57.800 --> 23:59.720]  I did a ton of speed tests,
[23:59.720 --> 24:02.480]  cause I got a, I got a series two review unit,
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.480]  but I also bought a series one for myself
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.440]  and then I had my original series zero.
[24:06.440 --> 24:08.440]  And I was doing like cross,
[24:08.440 --> 24:10.720]  cross ways speed tests on all of these.
[24:10.720 --> 24:11.960]  And the one thing like,
[24:11.960 --> 24:15.500]  the series two like blows the series zero out of the water
[24:15.500 --> 24:17.300]  in a bunch of different ways,
[24:17.300 --> 24:19.540]  the original generation Apple Watch.
[24:19.540 --> 24:22.840]  But when it comes to, barking dogs,
[24:22.840 --> 24:27.240]  when it comes to the difference between like series two,
[24:27.240 --> 24:30.120]  series one and the original generation Apple Watch
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.040]  and boot time or restore time,
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.440]  like the boot time on an Apple Watch series two
[24:36.440 --> 24:38.160]  is still over a minute.
[24:38.160 --> 24:41.880]  The boot time on series zero is like two and a half minutes,
[24:41.880 --> 24:43.120]  but it's still like,
[24:43.120 --> 24:46.100]  if I'm waiting a minute and 20 seconds
[24:46.100 --> 24:48.920]  for my watch to start up, problems.
[24:48.920 --> 24:50.160]  I'm gonna tell you about a good friend of the show.
[24:50.160 --> 24:51.160]  It's Fracture.
[24:51.160 --> 24:52.000]  You guys know Fracture.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.780]  They are the photo decor company
[24:53.780 --> 24:55.680]  that is out to rescue your favorite images
[24:55.680 --> 24:57.260]  from the digital ether.
[24:57.260 --> 25:00.100]  They print your photos directly onto glass
[25:00.100 --> 25:02.960]  and add a laser cut rigid backing.
[25:02.960 --> 25:05.400]  So they're ready to display right out of the box.
[25:05.400 --> 25:07.480]  They even include the wall anchor.
[25:07.480 --> 25:08.800]  I've told you about them before.
[25:08.800 --> 25:12.500]  They've been sponsoring this podcast in my mind forever.
[25:12.500 --> 25:13.340]  And they're back
[25:13.340 --> 25:15.560]  because you guys keep buying pictures from them.
[25:15.560 --> 25:18.160]  They're just a great, great service.
[25:18.160 --> 25:20.680]  It is, it's not just, I always say this.
[25:20.680 --> 25:23.280]  It does not look like a piece of paper
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.220]  that has a photo printed on it mounted to glass.
[25:26.220 --> 25:28.440]  It looks like, it's like the retina display.
[25:28.440 --> 25:31.600]  It looks like the picture is somehow on the glass.
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.540]  It is an amazing feature.
[25:33.540 --> 25:34.960]  When you hang them on a wall in your house
[25:34.960 --> 25:36.480]  and people come in, they will say,
[25:36.480 --> 25:38.520]  whoa, because it's noticeable.
[25:38.520 --> 25:39.600]  There's no frame around it.
[25:39.600 --> 25:40.760]  It's edge to edge.
[25:41.920 --> 25:43.520]  It looks like nothing else.
[25:43.520 --> 25:44.640]  And they'll say, how did you do that?
[25:44.640 --> 25:47.160]  And then you'll tell them about Fracture.
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.200]  One of the reasons that they're advertising right now,
[25:49.200 --> 25:50.160]  I know it's early.
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.000]  I know it's late September as we talk
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.320]  and probably as you listen.
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.120]  And it seems like Christmas is forever away.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.720]  But these are amazing gifts.
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.040]  They really are.
[26:01.040 --> 26:02.480]  You could knock out a whole bunch
[26:02.480 --> 26:05.080]  of your family gift giving early
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.440]  and they do tend to run late or they get backed up.
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.720]  So like you won't be able to order Fractures
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.200]  in like early December and still get them by Christmas.
[26:14.200 --> 26:17.300]  So it's a good time to knock off a little bit of that.
[26:18.400 --> 26:19.320]  Go there to find out more.
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.480]  They have all sorts of sizes, great prices,
[26:21.480 --> 26:23.840]  great, great quality.
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.840]  And if you go to this URL, fractureme.com slash podcast,
[26:29.640 --> 26:31.920]  you will save 10% off your first order.
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.440]  Fractureme.com slash podcast.
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.080]  And then don't forget to mention this show
[26:38.080 --> 26:42.040]  in their very, very long one question survey,
[26:42.040 --> 26:44.280]  which is where did you hear about fracture?
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.520]  So just mention the talk show there
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.840]  and they'll know you came from here.
[26:47.840 --> 26:49.080]  So my thanks to fracture.
[26:49.080 --> 26:50.500]  Go do it, you'll thank me later
[26:50.500 --> 26:54.020]  for getting all your family Christmas gifts out of the way.
[26:57.960 --> 26:59.320]  Anything else that bothers you
[26:59.320 --> 27:02.440]  about Apple's upgrade process and like Mac, iOS,
[27:02.440 --> 27:05.040]  switching to a new device, upgrading the OS,
[27:05.040 --> 27:06.840]  anything along those lines?
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.340]  Overall, I find it pretty smooth.
[27:10.340 --> 27:13.840]  The only thing that I think is a little bit frustrating
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.560]  is the, as much as I love the over-the-air download process
[27:17.560 --> 27:22.060]  for iOS, it can be very frustrating to update
[27:22.060 --> 27:25.680]  if you're on the go, obviously, because it's a big download.
[27:25.680 --> 27:28.560]  The iOS 10 download was a gigabyte.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.560]  But the problem is because of the way
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.400]  that the download currently works,
[27:33.400 --> 27:36.040]  say I'm waiting around for my download to fit,
[27:36.040 --> 27:37.240]  like it's update day, right?
[27:37.240 --> 27:40.860]  It's release day and I've downloaded half of the release,
[27:40.860 --> 27:42.560]  half of iOS 10 to my iPhone.
[27:42.560 --> 27:46.060]  And then for some reason, I need to go out and do an errand.
[27:46.060 --> 27:48.240]  Well, I could either leave the phone at home
[27:48.240 --> 27:50.200]  and at the rate that it was going,
[27:50.200 --> 27:52.260]  maybe like 10 kilobits a second,
[27:52.260 --> 27:54.280]  that would be downloaded,
[27:54.280 --> 27:56.720]  maybe half downloaded by the time I get back.
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.160]  Or maybe I need the phone while I'm out and about.
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.160]  And if I take the phone and I leave while it's downloading,
[28:04.160 --> 28:05.440]  there's no place where I can be like,
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.000]  pause my download while I go off Wi-Fi,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.760]  go do my errand, and then come back and resume my download
[28:11.760 --> 28:15.800]  and still have the half of the update that I downloaded back.
[28:15.800 --> 28:18.560]  You can do that on Safari for the Mac,
[28:18.560 --> 28:20.900]  you can do that even with iOS apps at this point
[28:20.900 --> 28:22.820]  with pause download.
[28:22.820 --> 28:26.080]  But there's no way to do that for these big updates.
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.240]  And I realize that's, again, maybe a bit of an edge case,
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.440]  but I know a lot of people who don't end up
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.960]  updating to iOS 10 because they don't find time to,
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.120]  even with, you know, Apple's done a lot better
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.360]  with the install while I'm sleeping and stuff like that.
[28:42.360 --> 28:45.940]  And the auto install night, that's all really nice,
[28:46.880 --> 28:48.840]  really nice improvements to this feature,
[28:48.840 --> 28:52.680]  but it still, it runs, there are still people who,
[28:52.680 --> 28:55.400]  they start to install it and they think it's installed
[28:55.400 --> 28:56.780]  because they started the process,
[28:56.780 --> 28:59.720]  and they don't even think, oh, if I leave my house
[28:59.720 --> 29:01.520]  before the install process is completed,
[29:01.520 --> 29:04.520]  it's just going to stop the install process
[29:04.520 --> 29:06.240]  and I'm never gonna get it installed.
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.720]  Like, just the average user is not obsessive
[29:08.720 --> 29:11.720]  about downloading things, they've gotten used
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.960]  to the iOS app, you know?
[29:13.960 --> 29:16.040]  I'm downloading an iOS app and the iOS app
[29:16.040 --> 29:17.820]  is gonna download wherever I am.
[29:17.820 --> 29:19.960]  Or it'll, you know, even if it can't get
[29:19.960 --> 29:21.960]  a good network connection or if I have cellular data
[29:21.960 --> 29:23.720]  turned off while I'm running around,
[29:23.720 --> 29:25.440]  it'll come back and finish downloading
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.120]  when I get back to my computer.
[29:27.120 --> 29:29.000]  But the update is not like that.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.360]  So that's my, like, nitpicky complaint.
[29:31.360 --> 29:34.600]  I can't really think of too many other ones.
[29:34.600 --> 29:36.300]  Me neither, but I agree with you.
[29:37.640 --> 29:39.800]  Here's one thing, if we're gonna skip around,
[29:39.800 --> 29:42.880]  but if we talk about iOS 10 and what it's,
[29:42.880 --> 29:44.600]  how it's faring in the real world,
[29:44.600 --> 29:48.200]  I'm hearing from, I don't wanna drop names,
[29:48.200 --> 29:49.980]  but people in the house,
[29:51.880 --> 29:56.880]  that the heavier doses of 3D touch to do things
[29:56.880 --> 29:58.800]  or force touch, whatever they call it on,
[29:58.800 --> 30:01.200]  I guess on iOS it's called 3D touch,
[30:01.200 --> 30:06.200]  is not a welcome addition to the operating system.
[30:06.200 --> 30:08.040]  Not a welcome addition, how?
[30:08.040 --> 30:11.360]  That it's too confusing or not intuitive
[30:11.360 --> 30:13.800]  when you need to press hard and when you just need
[30:13.800 --> 30:17.040]  to normally tap and that having these things that,
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.560]  like just to do the stickers in messages
[30:21.560 --> 30:23.000]  that you have to force touch on the arrow.
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.480]  Oh yeah, to move it.
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.480]  I see some merit in that, and to me it's sort of like
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.800]  the old one button mouse versus two button mouse argument
[30:36.680 --> 30:41.680]  where it seemed like, but maybe a little different
[30:42.280 --> 30:44.120]  because it seemed like in the old days
[30:44.120 --> 30:47.080]  when Apple obstinately, seemingly obstinately,
[30:47.080 --> 30:50.600]  stuck to a one button mouse when every single,
[30:50.600 --> 30:52.200]  it was a five-button mouse,
[30:52.200 --> 30:55.320]  and every single, it was a fundamental aspect
[30:55.320 --> 30:57.400]  of the Windows user interface that there were things
[30:57.400 --> 30:58.640]  you would right-click on.
[31:00.200 --> 31:02.220]  You couldn't really even properly use Windows
[31:02.220 --> 31:05.200]  without a two-button mouse, and I don't know that anybody,
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.560]  I don't even know that you could buy it
[31:06.560 --> 31:09.760]  like a one-button mouse for a PC.
[31:09.760 --> 31:11.280]  It wasn't even like a thing.
[31:11.280 --> 31:13.160]  Whereas, and it seemed like everybody,
[31:13.160 --> 31:16.040]  like the consensus among the nerds was that Apple
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.200]  is just sticking to this out of spite,
[31:18.200 --> 31:21.160]  whereas what I saw was that this is, sure,
[31:21.160 --> 31:24.480]  if you're a power user, you can go buy a two-button mouse
[31:24.480 --> 31:27.720]  or mouse with a scroll wheel and plug it in and it'll work,
[31:27.720 --> 31:29.920]  but for most people, all they have to do
[31:29.920 --> 31:33.560]  is understand click, and having just one type of click
[31:33.560 --> 31:36.440]  is fundamentally, it's so much simpler
[31:36.440 --> 31:38.340]  than even just having two types of clicks,
[31:38.340 --> 31:41.240]  let alone the crazy gaming mice you can buy
[31:41.240 --> 31:43.480]  with 20 different buttons.
[31:43.480 --> 31:46.520]  But even just going from one to two is a huge difference,
[31:46.520 --> 31:49.960]  and everybody has seen people in the real world
[31:49.960 --> 31:52.760]  who don't know what to click on
[31:52.760 --> 31:55.120]  and what to double-click on and stuff like that.
[31:55.120 --> 31:57.920]  Click and double-click was confusing enough for some people.
[31:57.920 --> 32:01.840]  And I felt like that was part of the genius of iOS,
[32:01.840 --> 32:04.680]  was dialing that all the way back to just tap.
[32:04.680 --> 32:06.520]  Everything is a tap.
[32:06.520 --> 32:10.760]  And I think Force Touch convulates that to some degree.
[32:10.760 --> 32:12.720]  Yeah, I mean, we were already getting
[32:12.720 --> 32:17.200]  into more advanced options with things like long presses,
[32:17.200 --> 32:21.200]  which have existed, I don't know, at least four or five
[32:21.200 --> 32:26.200]  iOS generations, maybe more earlier with third parties.
[32:26.720 --> 32:31.240]  I see 3D Touch a lot in the way that I see two-button mice
[32:31.240 --> 32:36.040]  on 1990s, early 2000s Apple computers,
[32:36.040 --> 32:39.480]  which is there's not really anything on an iPhone,
[32:39.480 --> 32:40.920]  at least that I can think of,
[32:40.920 --> 32:45.400]  where 3D Touch is necessary to do a core function.
[32:45.400 --> 32:48.440]  3D Touch makes it faster to open the battery pane
[32:48.440 --> 32:50.720]  in settings, but you can still get to the battery pane
[32:50.720 --> 32:52.840]  if you tap on settings and then tap on battery
[32:52.840 --> 32:54.360]  and then tap on low power mode.
[32:56.320 --> 32:57.600]  Can you think of something in,
[32:57.600 --> 32:59.480]  like I can think of stuff on the watch
[32:59.480 --> 33:02.760]  where you need Force Press to do extra things,
[33:02.760 --> 33:06.280]  but is there something besides maybe stickers
[33:06.280 --> 33:08.040]  where you really need a Force Press?
[33:08.040 --> 33:10.320]  The messages is one where there's certain things
[33:10.320 --> 33:11.440]  that you seem to have to Force Press,
[33:11.440 --> 33:13.280]  and then the other thing is to interact
[33:13.280 --> 33:15.960]  with the notification widgets, right?
[33:15.960 --> 33:16.800]  It seems like-
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.640]  Yeah, well, that's true.
[33:17.640 --> 33:20.360]  But again, you can tap on the notification widget
[33:20.360 --> 33:23.000]  and it'll send you to the right area.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.800]  Well, I get it, but it seems like Amy,
[33:25.800 --> 33:28.560]  to just name one person, doesn't always get,
[33:29.880 --> 33:33.640]  and she seems frustrated that sometimes she thinks
[33:33.640 --> 33:36.680]  she's pressing plenty hard enough to get a Force Touch
[33:36.680 --> 33:38.400]  and it's not registering.
[33:38.400 --> 33:41.960]  Yeah, well, that I think is an absolutely valid complaint
[33:41.960 --> 33:45.760]  in that Force Touch sometimes works marvelously.
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.640]  And I have my Force Touch 3D Touch press firmly.
[33:50.640 --> 33:53.600]  I have my setting to the lightest version
[33:53.600 --> 33:56.000]  so that it will trigger almost immediately
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.720]  once I start pressing down on the screen.
[33:57.720 --> 34:00.840]  And I would say it works about 75% of the time.
[34:00.840 --> 34:02.320]  Right, that's not good enough.
[34:02.320 --> 34:03.160]  No, exactly.
[34:03.160 --> 34:05.880]  And it's like, I mean, it will work other times,
[34:05.880 --> 34:08.000]  but other times it requires a little bit of firmer press
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.040]  and I'm not sure if it's because there's something
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.000]  on my fingers or if it's just the screen is misreading.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.080]  But yeah, it's a little bit frustrating.
[34:16.080 --> 34:18.860]  And the place where I notice it the most
[34:18.860 --> 34:21.000]  is turning the keyboard.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.580]  If you press firmly when the keyboard's active,
[34:23.580 --> 34:25.560]  you can turn that into a movable cursor.
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.320]  And I use that all the time when I'm writing on iOS
[34:29.320 --> 34:32.200]  and it was very, I don't know, very noticeable for me.
[34:32.200 --> 34:34.120]  I would just, I will reiterate that.
[34:34.120 --> 34:36.360]  That is my favorite 3D Touch feature.
[34:37.620 --> 34:39.440]  The first time I saw it last year,
[34:39.440 --> 34:41.200]  I was like, oh, I will use that all the time.
[34:41.200 --> 34:42.680]  And then I proceeded to forget
[34:42.680 --> 34:44.620]  that it existed for weeks at a time.
[34:44.620 --> 34:46.800]  So for listeners of the show, if you take one thing away,
[34:46.800 --> 34:48.480]  if you're gonna write down an actual note
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.840]  while you're listening to us talk,
[34:49.840 --> 34:51.940]  the one thing I would emphasize is remember
[34:51.940 --> 34:53.740]  that you can force touch on the keyboard
[34:53.740 --> 34:56.080]  to make the cursor like a mouse cursor
[34:56.080 --> 34:56.960]  that you can move around.
[34:56.960 --> 34:59.680]  Because once you really do internalize that
[34:59.680 --> 35:02.960]  and you don't have to think about it to use it,
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.000]  it is the best text editing change
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.920]  since the original iPhone.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.640]  Yeah, since copy and paste, quite honestly.
[35:09.640 --> 35:10.480]  Or at least since copy and paste.
[35:10.480 --> 35:14.280]  I don't use the, I rarely use the loop ever.
[35:14.280 --> 35:15.120]  What else?
[35:15.120 --> 35:15.940]  And if you press harder.
[35:15.940 --> 35:17.880]  Also, if you get a notification that you want to reply to,
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.480]  like a messages one would be an example,
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.360]  Tweetbot has it now for DMs,
[35:22.360 --> 35:25.240]  you have to force touch on it to get the inline,
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.280]  don't even open the app, just let me reply right here.
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.080]  Yeah, no, it looks like if you just tap the notification,
[35:31.080 --> 35:33.080]  it'll send you directly into the app.
[35:33.080 --> 35:35.920]  But you have to force touch to get that little shortcut.
[35:35.920 --> 35:37.560]  But again, we're talking about shortcuts.
[35:37.560 --> 35:40.000]  We're not talking about things where it's like,
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.280]  or you know what, actually, I take it back.
[35:42.280 --> 35:44.980]  Because if it appears at the top of the screen,
[35:44.980 --> 35:49.060]  you can drag down and it'll give you the information.
[35:49.060 --> 35:51.440]  So you can drag on it the same way that you could
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.180]  in I think iOS 9 or iOS 8,
[35:53.180 --> 35:56.640]  and it would give you the same kind of further preview.
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.680]  If it were up to me, I think I would make,
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.800]  I think that force touch should only and always
[36:03.800 --> 36:06.600]  be a shortcut for a long press.
[36:06.600 --> 36:08.360]  Yes, I agree with that.
[36:08.360 --> 36:10.640]  Anything that you do with a force touch,
[36:10.640 --> 36:13.880]  if you just hold there, you'll get the same thing.
[36:13.880 --> 36:16.320]  And I think that would be an accessibility win,
[36:16.320 --> 36:17.440]  because I think it would help for anybody
[36:17.440 --> 36:20.000]  who actually can't press hard enough.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.280]  And I think conceptually, it would simplify things.
[36:22.280 --> 36:25.000]  And I know that there are some conflicts.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.280]  Like right now, you force touch on an app icon
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.360]  on the home screen to get the list of shortcuts
[36:30.360 --> 36:31.760]  for that app.
[36:31.760 --> 36:34.140]  And you long press to get into jiggle mode
[36:34.140 --> 36:35.360]  where you rearrange apps.
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.040]  That's so annoying, I wish I could just do both.
[36:38.040 --> 36:40.440]  Yeah, I think it should just be one shortcut,
[36:40.440 --> 36:42.360]  and then one of the options for every app
[36:42.360 --> 36:43.840]  would be like edit, dot, dot, dot.
[36:43.840 --> 36:44.920]  Edit, yeah, exactly.
[36:44.920 --> 36:47.800]  And use like an icon to indicate that,
[36:47.800 --> 36:49.760]  I'm sure there's some visual way that you could indicate
[36:49.760 --> 36:52.040]  like this is how you get into the old jiggle mode.
[36:54.360 --> 36:56.760]  It could easily be tied together like that.
[36:56.760 --> 36:58.040]  And the other one that I remember
[36:58.040 --> 37:00.780]  is if you go to the Apple weather app,
[37:00.780 --> 37:05.780]  and you go to the list of cities or locations,
[37:06.520 --> 37:08.680]  I tried to rearrange them before a trip
[37:08.680 --> 37:11.720]  to move like where I was going up to be like number two
[37:11.720 --> 37:14.560]  so I could always, right beneath the local,
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.120]  you know, wherever I am.
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.560]  And I couldn't remember how to rearrange the cities
[37:18.560 --> 37:19.400]  for the life of me.
[37:19.400 --> 37:20.800]  I just kept force touching on them
[37:20.800 --> 37:22.620]  and it just kept opening them.
[37:22.620 --> 37:24.080]  And it took me like a minute to remember
[37:24.080 --> 37:25.560]  that you have to press and hold on them.
[37:25.560 --> 37:27.280]  You have to press firmly.
[37:27.280 --> 37:28.560]  No, not press firmly.
[37:28.560 --> 37:29.400]  You press firmly.
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.400]  Sorry, press lightly to rearrange.
[37:32.400 --> 37:34.840]  Press firmly to like pull up a pop-up.
[37:34.840 --> 37:37.160]  Right, and then if while you're waiting
[37:37.160 --> 37:38.840]  for the hold to be long enough,
[37:38.840 --> 37:40.880]  you start pressing too hard, it opens up.
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.200]  Those little things are so frustrating,
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.040]  especially if you are, you know,
[37:47.040 --> 37:49.640]  somebody who goes in between pressing firmly
[37:49.640 --> 37:53.240]  and long presses, like trying to rearrange your app icons.
[37:53.240 --> 37:56.200]  That is, that's kind of an exercise in frustration
[37:56.200 --> 37:59.920]  and maybe just not enough people rearrange their app icons
[37:59.920 --> 38:01.340]  on a regular basis anymore.
[38:01.340 --> 38:02.720]  They just, they don't care about
[38:02.720 --> 38:04.680]  the way their home screen looks or,
[38:04.680 --> 38:07.540]  because I feel like Apple must be getting complaints
[38:07.540 --> 38:08.380]  about this, right?
[38:08.380 --> 38:09.840]  Oh, I'm trying to rearrange my icons
[38:09.840 --> 38:11.800]  and I can't remember how to do it anymore.
[38:11.800 --> 38:13.160]  I don't know.
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.800]  It just, I feel like they could be made together.
[38:16.800 --> 38:20.520]  I feel like they, you know, be like an iOS 11 change,
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.560]  not like an iOS 10.2 change,
[38:22.560 --> 38:25.120]  but I feel like long press and force touch
[38:25.120 --> 38:26.560]  could be unified.
[38:26.560 --> 38:27.400]  I think so.
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.560]  And it may, it may be one of those things where,
[38:32.880 --> 38:34.300]  sorry at the end.
[38:34.300 --> 38:35.640]  No, let them work.
[38:35.640 --> 38:36.480]  Yeah.
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.840]  I think Rick is coming home, so they're really excited.
[38:40.840 --> 38:45.440]  Yeah, I think it may be something where in iOS 11,
[38:45.440 --> 38:48.720]  we may see a more drastic change to the home screen
[38:48.720 --> 38:50.760]  or something like that, where they're kind of like,
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.480]  we know this is a hack job right now,
[38:53.480 --> 38:56.560]  but we promise it will all go away soon.
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.480]  And I under, like on part,
[38:58.480 --> 39:00.980]  part of me understands that from a,
[39:00.980 --> 39:03.240]  okay, we're working towards a bigger objective
[39:03.240 --> 39:04.460]  and a bigger picture here,
[39:04.460 --> 39:06.160]  but the fact remains that 3D Touch
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.480]  has now been an operation or will be an operation
[39:08.480 --> 39:10.280]  for two whole release cycles.
[39:10.280 --> 39:12.440]  And to say like, this is a hand wave,
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.920]  we're gonna make it better soon for two years worth is,
[39:15.920 --> 39:18.480]  that's stretching it for the average user.
[39:18.480 --> 39:20.360]  That's kind of painful.
[39:20.360 --> 39:23.400]  It is interesting to me watching the reaction of people
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.400]  who are all new to iOS 10.
[39:26.400 --> 39:29.960]  And we talked before about the home button change
[39:29.960 --> 39:32.860]  where you have to, there's no more swipe to unlock.
[39:34.360 --> 39:37.400]  Seems like at first, an awful lot of people
[39:37.400 --> 39:41.960]  objected to some of the visual changes in iOS 10,
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.600]  which I think in broad strokes-
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.040]  In terms of like the new control center and the, yeah.
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.880]  In a way that the widgets look more like windows.
[39:53.880 --> 39:56.600]  There's like a 3D-ness and they don't go,
[39:56.600 --> 39:57.680]  they're not full width.
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.480]  They have entire, they're encapsulated.
[40:00.480 --> 40:02.320]  They're a little bubbly, yeah.
[40:02.320 --> 40:04.540]  There's just a little bit more depth to the interface.
[40:04.540 --> 40:08.820]  It is, to borrow an overused term
[40:08.820 --> 40:11.420]  from when iOS 7 came out, it's less flat.
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.720]  And not so much in a way that the actual individual buttons
[40:16.720 --> 40:19.520]  and little windows themselves have 3D,
[40:19.520 --> 40:22.020]  but that the layering of where they are in the system
[40:22.020 --> 40:22.860]  is more 3D.
[40:22.860 --> 40:23.960]  I like it a lot.
[40:23.960 --> 40:25.720]  I think it's actually- As do I.
[40:25.720 --> 40:28.500]  To me, it's like iOS 10 has really,
[40:30.760 --> 40:34.040]  it just shows how long it takes
[40:34.040 --> 40:36.200]  to get a major design right.
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.800]  And to me, iOS 10 is the one where,
[40:38.800 --> 40:40.380]  what they were thinking with iOS 7,
[40:40.380 --> 40:44.360]  they've really dialed it back up
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.960]  to where the appropriate level of depth.
[40:47.960 --> 40:50.980]  It's an iMovie 08 to iMovie 11 kind of thing.
[40:50.980 --> 40:51.820]  Yeah.
[40:51.820 --> 40:53.280]  I wrote a, go ahead.
[40:53.280 --> 40:55.200]  Well, it just seems to me like people complained
[40:55.200 --> 40:57.360]  about it at first, but it seems like right now,
[40:57.360 --> 40:58.960]  as of now, everybody, now they've,
[40:58.960 --> 41:01.100]  it was really just the newness that bothered them.
[41:01.100 --> 41:03.520]  And now they've gotten used to it.
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.320]  Well, it's the, any time that you change
[41:06.320 --> 41:07.960]  someone's interaction path,
[41:07.960 --> 41:09.600]  they're gonna grumble about it for a little while.
[41:09.600 --> 41:12.240]  Same thing we were talking about with the touch ID
[41:12.240 --> 41:13.660]  and opening the phone,
[41:13.660 --> 41:14.880]  where it's like the control center
[41:14.880 --> 41:16.560]  now having multiple cards.
[41:16.560 --> 41:18.560]  Initially, that was a bit of a pain,
[41:18.560 --> 41:20.800]  especially if you're dealing with sliders,
[41:20.800 --> 41:23.440]  because if you don't tap on the right place for a slider,
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.780]  you might accidentally slide the pane left to right.
[41:26.780 --> 41:29.400]  And putting things in slightly different places,
[41:29.400 --> 41:31.400]  being like, oh, I can't find this anymore,
[41:31.400 --> 41:32.440]  and where is this?
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.600]  And how, why does Notification Center
[41:34.600 --> 41:36.260]  still have the widget screen in it,
[41:36.260 --> 41:37.800]  despite the fact that the widget screen
[41:37.800 --> 41:40.620]  is now its own real thing on the left-hand side?
[41:40.620 --> 41:43.080]  Like, there are still little bits and pieces here
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.600]  that aren't quite right.
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.800]  But I wrote about this right after WWDC,
[41:48.800 --> 41:50.440]  in terms of the way that Apple
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.340]  has changed the visual narrative
[41:52.340 --> 41:54.600]  to really be about stacks and layers,
[41:54.600 --> 41:56.040]  and about, you know, the home screen
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.680]  is kind of your neutral layer now,
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.840]  and then apps pop up on top,
[42:00.840 --> 42:03.920]  and you've got Control Center and Notification Center
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.040]  on top above everything else.
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.840]  And it's just, it's unified it now,
[42:07.840 --> 42:09.160]  where it actually makes sense.
[42:09.160 --> 42:11.440]  And then the lock screen is on top of everything else,
[42:11.440 --> 42:14.060]  because the lock screen is basically like keeping you
[42:14.060 --> 42:16.480]  in this box, like, you're opening the box,
[42:16.480 --> 42:19.280]  you're pressing through with the home button
[42:19.280 --> 42:21.600]  to go into this box, and it's, I don't know,
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.600]  from a purely like tactile visual sense,
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.880]  which, odd combination of words there,
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.880]  but really, it's very pleasing subconsciously, I think.
[42:34.240 --> 42:36.300]  And initially, again, people are gonna be complaining
[42:36.300 --> 42:37.780]  about it, because it doesn't,
[42:37.780 --> 42:39.820]  it's not what they were used to, right?
[42:39.820 --> 42:41.920]  But as you get used to it, I think it becomes
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.080]  more and more comfortable, and things make sense.
[42:45.080 --> 42:49.380]  It goes from a, I'm looking for this feature,
[42:49.380 --> 42:51.740]  oh, well, now I'm getting trained,
[42:51.740 --> 42:54.560]  I'm getting visually trained to be like, okay,
[42:54.560 --> 42:56.920]  well, apps are, you know, apps are found
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.420]  by pulling something up, or pulling, you know,
[42:59.420 --> 43:00.840]  pulling from a side of the screen,
[43:00.840 --> 43:03.040]  or moving from side, like there's, I don't know,
[43:03.040 --> 43:06.660]  I really like the direction they're going with this.
[43:06.660 --> 43:10.320]  I, one of the things that I think that they got wrong in iOS 7
[43:10.320 --> 43:12.800]  and that they've, and to me, they've really,
[43:12.800 --> 43:15.240]  this is, iOS 10 is really where they've fixed it
[43:15.240 --> 43:19.140]  in a lot of ways, is, and this is something I think that,
[43:19.140 --> 43:20.560]  I'm willing to excuse a lot of it,
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.180]  as it just takes more than one or two years
[43:23.180 --> 43:26.480]  to get a complete redesign right.
[43:26.480 --> 43:28.920]  This is one of the things I think they could have gotten
[43:28.920 --> 43:31.920]  much better right from the start, and for some reason,
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.520]  whatever was in their heads, collectively, was wrong,
[43:35.520 --> 43:38.400]  was making sure that the visual indication
[43:38.400 --> 43:40.520]  of like something that's either on or off
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.520]  is absolutely clear, and I think it was their,
[43:48.240 --> 43:51.120]  I think it was a desire for aesthetic purposes
[43:51.120 --> 43:55.320]  to not use color is what burned them in iOS 7.
[43:55.320 --> 43:57.840]  And so, for example, what I'm looking at is the way
[43:57.840 --> 44:00.600]  that like when you have WiFi on in Control Center,
[44:00.600 --> 44:02.720]  it's just a bright, vivid blue,
[44:02.720 --> 44:04.660]  and then if you tap it to turn it off,
[44:04.660 --> 44:08.100]  it is very clearly off, because it's gray and drab.
[44:09.920 --> 44:11.920]  I think that's one of my favorite changes,
[44:11.920 --> 44:14.400]  is just the way that they're way more willing
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.400]  in iOS 10 to use plops, little bits of very vivid color,
[44:20.360 --> 44:23.000]  to clearly indicate state in a way
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.920]  that they weren't before.
[44:24.920 --> 44:27.760]  Yeah, I mean, the color changes to iOS 10, I think,
[44:27.760 --> 44:31.160]  have been one of the biggest improvements
[44:31.160 --> 44:34.760]  upon the flat design, because you do,
[44:34.760 --> 44:38.400]  it's like, okay, we can't use depth inside our buttons
[44:38.400 --> 44:40.240]  to show what's on, what's off,
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.800]  so let's actually use really bright, vivid, nice colors.
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.720]  And you saw them kind of experimenting with that
[44:45.720 --> 44:48.060]  in the original music app,
[44:48.060 --> 44:50.960]  but it's really come kind of full circle now.
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.040]  And you can kind of even see where they're going
[44:53.040 --> 44:55.640]  by looking at the new music app and the new maps app
[44:55.640 --> 44:58.480]  in terms of that like the bolder design
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.200]  and using bright colors for each of the entries.
[45:01.200 --> 45:03.420]  I like that so much more than just,
[45:03.420 --> 45:06.440]  here's black and here's gray.
[45:06.440 --> 45:08.640]  All right, here's one I got like,
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.400]  it's like my most explosively popular tweet of the month
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.000]  was just the simple observation
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.120]  that the night shift button in Control Center
[45:19.120 --> 45:22.480]  has an unusual prominence and amount of screen real estate.
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.600]  It's so large, I don't understand.
[45:25.600 --> 45:29.240]  It's not like I never ever want to use this feature.
[45:30.160 --> 45:31.000]  I don't like it.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.120]  I understand lots of people do,
[45:33.120 --> 45:34.280]  very popular with some people,
[45:34.280 --> 45:37.160]  but I don't understand why it's so much more prominent
[45:37.160 --> 45:39.040]  than any of the five things at the top,
[45:39.040 --> 45:41.200]  airplane mode, wifi, Bluetooth,
[45:42.360 --> 45:45.240]  do not disturb, and then rotation lock.
[45:45.240 --> 45:46.740]  Especially because night shift
[45:46.740 --> 45:49.360]  should be set automatically, right?
[45:49.360 --> 45:50.200]  Right.
[45:50.200 --> 45:51.900]  It's like to go at a certain time.
[45:51.900 --> 45:53.520]  Right, if you really like the feature,
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.000]  why in the world wouldn't you have it set
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.680]  to turn on at sundown?
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.120]  I wonder if it's a placeholder for something.
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.680]  That's what an awful lot of people suspect
[46:04.680 --> 46:06.420]  is that it's a placeholder,
[46:06.420 --> 46:09.200]  but what is it that they think it's a placeholder for?
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.940]  I don't know.
[46:10.940 --> 46:13.680]  There is something, and it's not occurring to me.
[46:13.680 --> 46:14.520]  There's something that people-
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.560]  I mean, you could argue play pause buttons
[46:16.560 --> 46:18.280]  instead of the music having its own-
[46:18.280 --> 46:19.720]  Well, that's the thing, that's where I'm going,
[46:19.720 --> 46:21.640]  is that there are people,
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.900]  because there used to be room there
[46:22.900 --> 46:25.260]  for the little playback controls,
[46:25.260 --> 46:27.240]  and people, that does seem like one change
[46:27.240 --> 46:28.640]  that I think has merit,
[46:28.640 --> 46:31.660]  and it's not just resistance to change,
[46:31.660 --> 46:33.880]  but that seems to me like real people
[46:33.880 --> 46:36.400]  are not happy with the playback controls
[46:36.400 --> 46:38.000]  being on a second screen.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.400]  Yeah, I don't mind it so much.
[46:41.400 --> 46:44.080]  It's just, it's the problem of discovery, right?
[46:44.080 --> 46:46.160]  Where people who are used to Control Center
[46:46.160 --> 46:48.080]  just having one pane, they pull it up,
[46:48.080 --> 46:50.720]  and they don't see the tiny dots at the bottom.
[46:50.720 --> 46:52.720]  They just see the fact that there are no music controls,
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.400]  so they automatically assume that the music app,
[46:55.400 --> 46:57.720]  just you can't control it from Control Center anymore.
[46:57.720 --> 47:00.320]  It would be nice to be able to edit
[47:00.320 --> 47:01.440]  the Control Center, though,
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.040]  to make Control Center something
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.480]  where you can configure it to be just what you use.
[47:07.480 --> 47:09.000]  I completely agree,
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.080]  and maybe that's the placeholder for Night Shift.
[47:12.080 --> 47:14.480]  Some people, I've also seen some people,
[47:14.480 --> 47:15.640]  in response to my tweets, say,
[47:15.640 --> 47:17.720]  why can't it be like Notification Center,
[47:17.720 --> 47:19.760]  where you pull down from the top,
[47:19.760 --> 47:21.560]  and Notification Center is full screen?
[47:21.560 --> 47:23.520]  Why doesn't Control Center full screen?
[47:23.520 --> 47:25.520]  Then there'd be room for everything on one screen,
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.040]  and I think that the obvious answer to that is,
[47:29.040 --> 47:30.920]  especially with the plus,
[47:30.920 --> 47:33.020]  you can't reach the stuff at the top.
[47:33.020 --> 47:37.480]  Yeah, and it seems very clearly designed to me
[47:37.480 --> 47:40.940]  that it's meant to be reachable with one thumb,
[47:42.440 --> 47:45.920]  so therefore, it really shouldn't and can't be full screen.
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.880]  Yeah, and if you try, you can't use reachability
[47:49.880 --> 47:51.560]  when Control Center is active.
[47:51.560 --> 47:52.940]  You can with Notification Center,
[47:52.940 --> 47:54.400]  but not with Control Center.
[47:56.060 --> 47:57.280]  Reachability is a good one.
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.600]  So I wrote in my iPhone 7 review
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.600]  that I had to turn reachability off
[48:02.600 --> 48:05.800]  because I found myself constantly,
[48:05.800 --> 48:07.720]  inadvertently invoking it.
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.180]  Anecdotally, asking around with a bunch of friends on Slack,
[48:13.180 --> 48:17.000]  A, my friends, a lot of my friends
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.480]  have run into this themselves
[48:18.480 --> 48:21.840]  and had to do the same thing, turn off reachability,
[48:21.840 --> 48:26.840]  and B, they reported that the normals in their life
[48:28.920 --> 48:30.600]  have been running into the same thing,
[48:30.600 --> 48:33.080]  and that the normal people have no idea
[48:33.080 --> 48:36.760]  what the hell reachability is, and that it just...
[48:36.760 --> 48:39.360]  They just don't know why their screen is going down halfway.
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.880]  Yeah, a friend of the show, John Siracusa,
[48:41.880 --> 48:45.340]  said that his mom invoked it on her iPad,
[48:45.340 --> 48:49.280]  and his dad fixed it by restarting the iPad,
[48:49.280 --> 48:52.560]  but that it was so confusing that it looked...
[48:52.560 --> 48:54.160]  And I can see why.
[48:54.160 --> 48:55.540]  It almost seems like a drawing problem,
[48:55.540 --> 48:57.360]  like you've run into this bizarre bug
[48:57.360 --> 49:00.700]  where the computer is drawing your screen halfway down.
[49:01.680 --> 49:02.520]  Oh my gosh.
[49:02.520 --> 49:03.520]  Have you run into this, or no?
[49:03.520 --> 49:06.120]  You know, I actually, I was expecting to,
[49:06.120 --> 49:08.380]  after hearing a bunch of people get really concerned
[49:08.380 --> 49:09.600]  about it with the new home button,
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.280]  and I actually haven't at all.
[49:11.280 --> 49:16.280]  And maybe that's just because I have used reachability
[49:16.400 --> 49:18.640]  a fair amount when I've been using the Plus,
[49:18.640 --> 49:21.120]  so I have figured out kind of a way to trigger it
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.160]  versus a way to just press the home button.
[49:23.160 --> 49:25.000]  The bigger problem that I've actually been having,
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.360]  and again, this is kind of a niche thing,
[49:26.360 --> 49:28.720]  but I've had a problem taking screenshots,
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.020]  where I used to have no problem whatsoever,
[49:32.020 --> 49:33.280]  but because of the home button,
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.940]  I now have the same problem that I have on the Apple Watch,
[49:35.940 --> 49:38.140]  where I have to press one button and then the other
[49:38.140 --> 49:40.360]  to really make sure that the screenshot takes,
[49:40.360 --> 49:41.940]  especially if I'm doing something weird,
[49:41.940 --> 49:44.000]  like taking a picture of the camera app
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.800]  while the camera app is open.
[49:45.800 --> 49:48.120]  I don't know why either.
[49:48.120 --> 49:49.560]  I don't know why.
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.220]  And subjective preference for the new home button
[49:54.220 --> 49:56.980]  versus the old home button aside,
[49:56.980 --> 50:00.220]  I find that my screenshots have a 50% failure right now.
[50:02.480 --> 50:05.920]  Either the home button takes me home
[50:05.920 --> 50:07.440]  before the screenshot takes off,
[50:07.440 --> 50:10.440]  or the power button powers off of the-
[50:10.440 --> 50:12.080]  It turns it off, and that's even worse.
[50:12.080 --> 50:13.960]  Right, it turns it off.
[50:13.960 --> 50:16.320]  I have found the opposite, though.
[50:16.320 --> 50:18.800]  I've found that the only way I can get it to work reliably
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.380]  is to concentrate very hard on simultaneously posts,
[50:22.380 --> 50:24.120]  very, with much concentration,
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.680]  pressing both buttons at the same time.
[50:26.680 --> 50:28.360]  It's even worse on the Plus model, too,
[50:28.360 --> 50:30.400]  because it's so darn big.
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.400]  Just trying to time it is impossible.
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.800]  Anyway, those are truly, truly first-world problems,
[50:38.800 --> 50:40.420]  and not a huge deal.
[50:40.420 --> 50:43.760]  But, you know, it's things that I certainly
[50:43.760 --> 50:46.260]  wouldn't be adverse to an Apple engineer looking at
[50:46.260 --> 50:48.960]  and being like, hmm, maybe we need to adjust the timing.
[50:52.020 --> 50:54.400]  Trying to think what else people are complaining about.
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.560]  Like, that might be it.
[50:59.100 --> 51:02.840]  Yeah, hmm, on the iPhone.
[51:02.840 --> 51:05.480]  I mean, people are complaining about the home button behavior
[51:05.480 --> 51:07.400]  that aside, or just the feel of the home button,
[51:07.400 --> 51:08.680]  but I feel, I don't know.
[51:08.680 --> 51:10.600]  I really like the new home button.
[51:10.600 --> 51:12.040]  I vastly prefer it.
[51:12.040 --> 51:13.200]  Yeah.
[51:13.200 --> 51:15.240]  What setting do you use?
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.040]  Currently, I have the hardest click on,
[51:17.040 --> 51:20.640]  because I just like the feel of the Taptic Engine,
[51:20.640 --> 51:24.500]  so I like having kind of that rumble
[51:24.500 --> 51:26.620]  when I press in on the home button.
[51:26.620 --> 51:30.440]  But I also like kind of, Matthew Panzorino mentioned this
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.240]  in his review, and I thought that it was quite smart,
[51:33.240 --> 51:36.680]  where he was saying, oh, I switch the severity
[51:36.680 --> 51:39.120]  of the Taptic Engine when I'm doing things
[51:39.120 --> 51:40.640]  where I don't wanna wake up my baby,
[51:40.640 --> 51:43.640]  or I wanna do, you know, I wanna access the home button
[51:43.640 --> 51:45.960]  while I'm on a podcast, and I don't wanna disturb anybody.
[51:45.960 --> 51:47.880]  And I'm like, that's actually brilliant.
[51:47.880 --> 51:49.840]  Because there have been so many times
[51:49.840 --> 51:51.780]  where I'm like, I wanna test out an iPhone
[51:51.780 --> 51:54.080]  or test out a feature in the middle of a podcast.
[51:54.080 --> 51:56.700]  But the click on an old iPhone,
[51:56.700 --> 51:58.660]  especially if you're doing it anywhere near the mic,
[51:58.660 --> 52:01.840]  is pretty prominent, and it's like a click
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.080]  on an old trackpad or an old mouse.
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.000]  I am still firmly in the, I prefer the old.
[52:10.000 --> 52:10.840]  The old button.
[52:10.840 --> 52:13.880]  Old button, and it's been enough time now
[52:15.280 --> 52:18.040]  that I think it's, I think it, you know,
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.240]  I forget, when did I get this, when did I start using this?
[52:20.240 --> 52:21.080]  It must have been three weeks ago.
[52:21.080 --> 52:22.160]  Three weeks, yeah.
[52:23.820 --> 52:26.880]  But I can accept it, and I had that feeling
[52:26.880 --> 52:28.520]  right from the start, even just a day in.
[52:28.520 --> 52:29.960]  I was like, I don't think I like this.
[52:29.960 --> 52:34.040]  I think I prefer the other way, but it's fine.
[52:34.040 --> 52:36.840]  I am also on button level three.
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.360]  Other friend of the show though, Ben Thompson,
[52:40.360 --> 52:44.960]  of Strateecary fame, is, he loves the new button.
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.560]  And that's where I'm going with this,
[52:46.560 --> 52:49.280]  is that it is very clear that I don't like it as much.
[52:49.280 --> 52:52.440]  Other people, you, Ben Thompson, like it,
[52:52.440 --> 52:53.880]  prefer it to the old button.
[52:53.880 --> 52:57.080]  Ben also is a proponent of setting one.
[52:57.080 --> 53:00.280]  He thinks that setting three is for people
[53:00.280 --> 53:02.280]  who wanna fake a button, and that you should go
[53:02.280 --> 53:06.440]  with the flow, that it's not a button.
[53:06.440 --> 53:08.480]  And he likes it on setting number one.
[53:08.480 --> 53:12.040]  And so I, on his advice, I spent a day and a half
[53:12.040 --> 53:14.360]  on setting one, and I guess I can kinda see it,
[53:14.360 --> 53:15.600]  but then when I went back to three,
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.680]  I was like, oh no, this is much nicer.
[53:17.680 --> 53:20.460]  No, I, you know, I just like tactile sensation too.
[53:20.460 --> 53:22.680]  This is, like, this is the same reason why
[53:22.680 --> 53:24.820]  sometimes I will just open up the date picker
[53:24.820 --> 53:26.580]  and just play with it on the new models,
[53:26.580 --> 53:29.200]  because it's just nice, it's nice to feel.
[53:31.280 --> 53:33.880]  On that, I was thinking, I'm so glad you said that,
[53:33.880 --> 53:37.160]  because you mentioned with the control center,
[53:37.160 --> 53:39.760]  when you go to change the brightness slider,
[53:39.760 --> 53:43.800]  you, if you miss, you actually just slide over to music.
[53:43.800 --> 53:46.800]  You should have a little taptic feedback for the slider.
[53:46.800 --> 53:49.480]  Oh, that's a great idea, like a little tick, tick, tick.
[53:49.480 --> 53:51.120]  Yeah, as soon as you, then you know
[53:51.120 --> 53:53.840]  that you've got the little, the thing
[53:53.840 --> 53:55.520]  that you actually slide.
[53:55.520 --> 53:57.200]  Well, especially, you already have the haptic
[53:57.200 --> 53:59.240]  and control center when you slide up,
[53:59.240 --> 54:02.400]  but you don't have a haptic sliding side to side, so.
[54:02.400 --> 54:04.440]  It would let you know, it would confirm for you
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.760]  that you've got the nubbin, or whatever.
[54:06.760 --> 54:10.760]  I honestly think right now in iOS 10.0.2,
[54:12.140 --> 54:15.040]  I think we're on the main seed,
[54:15.040 --> 54:17.400]  taptic feedback is very, I don't wanna say
[54:17.400 --> 54:21.740]  haphazardly implemented, but it's very much like
[54:21.740 --> 54:24.160]  the engineers put in a bunch of potential things
[54:24.160 --> 54:26.160]  and then left out a bunch of potential other ones
[54:26.160 --> 54:27.660]  and like, let's see what sticks,
[54:27.660 --> 54:29.680]  let's see what people like, let's see if,
[54:29.680 --> 54:31.200]  instead, you know, people might write
[54:31.200 --> 54:33.220]  and say we hate all of this taptic stuff,
[54:33.220 --> 54:35.320]  but every, like there are places where I feel
[54:35.320 --> 54:37.780]  like I should have taptic, like in notes,
[54:37.780 --> 54:40.980]  tapping on a note to change to the keyboard view,
[54:40.980 --> 54:43.720]  I wanted like a little, a click there
[54:43.720 --> 54:45.520]  to let me know, oh, I'm in editing view,
[54:45.520 --> 54:48.580]  oh, I'm out of editing view, or have you,
[54:48.580 --> 54:49.420]  this is my favorite.
[54:49.420 --> 54:50.240]  Well, it should feel like it comes up,
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.960]  like in the way that when you spin the date picker,
[54:52.960 --> 54:55.000]  it feels like it's spinning in the direction
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.540]  that you are spinning, but the keyboard,
[54:58.540 --> 55:01.580]  when it slides up, should have like a slight chunk
[55:01.580 --> 55:05.180]  that would fake the semi, like when you had
[55:05.180 --> 55:07.600]  like a slider phone, and you'd, you know,
[55:07.600 --> 55:09.480]  like the old Palm Pre, you'd, you know,
[55:09.480 --> 55:11.640]  obviously when you slid the keyboard down,
[55:11.640 --> 55:14.640]  it felt like something was sliding down, because it was.
[55:15.780 --> 55:18.800]  Well, and you have that feeling for control center anyway,
[55:18.800 --> 55:21.000]  so it's a haptic that's already implemented.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.320]  Right, it should be exactly the same
[55:22.320 --> 55:24.160]  as the control center one.
[55:24.160 --> 55:27.860]  Yeah, have you used, and this is my favorite haptic,
[55:27.860 --> 55:31.760]  maybe, in the system, if you go over on the digital,
[55:31.760 --> 55:34.880]  on the digital keyboard, and you hold down,
[55:34.880 --> 55:37.440]  not firm press, mind you, just long press
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.160]  on, say, the dash button, it brings up a little haptic
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.200]  to change it from a dash to an N dash
[55:45.200 --> 55:48.320]  to an M dash to a bullet, and then when you're sliding
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.420]  between those, you have haptic for all of those little,
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.220]  those little options, and that is my favorite,
[55:54.220 --> 55:56.660]  like, as soon as I discovered that,
[55:56.660 --> 55:58.520]  that made me look towards the future,
[55:58.520 --> 55:59.980]  where I was saying, like, where things
[55:59.980 --> 56:01.600]  are not so haphazardly implemented,
[56:01.600 --> 56:04.380]  and when, perhaps, we might have the battery life
[56:04.380 --> 56:07.040]  to be able to put the entire keyboard haptic,
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.600]  which I actually, I really wanna see a full haptic keyboard,
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.000]  even just as a proof of concept
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.460]  with the current haptic engine,
[56:14.460 --> 56:16.520]  because I think it would actually be better,
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.020]  not, like, obviously, it's not gonna feel
[56:18.020 --> 56:20.200]  like a real keyboard, but I think it would be a lot better
[56:20.200 --> 56:22.240]  than people currently think it might be.
[56:22.240 --> 56:27.240]  Yeah, I have that on the Moto X.
[56:27.880 --> 56:30.960]  This is the, my most, I guess I'm waiting
[56:30.960 --> 56:32.940]  for to see what Google announces next week,
[56:32.940 --> 56:35.480]  but it's the most recent Android device I bought.
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.020]  It's from December 2014, and it's the one
[56:39.020 --> 56:42.280]  that you could pick what the material on the back is.
[56:42.280 --> 56:43.320]  Remember that phone?
[56:43.320 --> 56:44.160]  Yeah.
[56:44.160 --> 56:45.280]  That's a real gimmick, but anyway,
[56:45.280 --> 56:48.840]  this phone has haptic feedback on the keyboard,
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.080]  but it has no directional sense at all.
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.900]  So whether you're in the Q at the top left
[56:55.900 --> 57:00.200]  or the M at the bottom right, it's the same tap,
[57:00.200 --> 57:02.160]  whereas it seems like Apple's got something
[57:02.160 --> 57:07.160]  in the new phones that has a little bit of X and Y axis.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.900]  Oh, yeah, there's definitely a rotational motor,
[57:09.900 --> 57:12.840]  and you can kind of feel that even just doing 3D touch
[57:12.840 --> 57:15.360]  on the home screen, where if you tap on something
[57:15.360 --> 57:17.040]  in sort of the bottom right corner
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.920]  that's gonna pull up a widget going upwards,
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.720]  you can actually feel it going up,
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.700]  as opposed to pressing at the top of the screen
[57:24.700 --> 57:26.160]  and having a widget going down.
[57:26.160 --> 57:28.240]  And I don't know how much of that is brain trickery
[57:28.240 --> 57:30.040]  and how much of that is actually the motor
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.120]  like jiggling in a certain direction, but it's nifty.
[57:33.120 --> 57:35.960]  I can't, I have to imagine that they looked into it
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.360]  and just, either they weren't satisfied
[57:38.360 --> 57:39.920]  and therefore didn't release it,
[57:39.920 --> 57:42.360]  or there's some, they had to have tried it,
[57:42.360 --> 57:44.680]  because for all the things that, you know,
[57:44.680 --> 57:46.960]  if we're gonna start putting haptic feedback
[57:46.960 --> 57:49.880]  in the OS, the keyboard had to have been
[57:49.880 --> 57:52.840]  on the top of the list of things to try.
[57:52.840 --> 57:55.440]  Well, that's, I think that's gotta be their eventual goal.
[57:55.440 --> 57:57.800]  Like when they talked about putting the Taptic Engine
[57:57.800 --> 57:59.940]  way back in the first generation of the Apple Watch,
[57:59.940 --> 58:02.200]  that was my first thought, is I'm like this is,
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.720]  this is our slow path to getting a fully haptic keyboard
[58:06.720 --> 58:08.600]  and having that work properly.
[58:08.600 --> 58:11.480]  But I have to imagine that haptic is not quite
[58:11.480 --> 58:13.800]  where they want it, where they actually wanna,
[58:13.800 --> 58:14.940]  you know, put it on the keyboard,
[58:14.940 --> 58:18.000]  because I imagine their eventual goal
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.480]  is to combine haptics with the pressure sensitivity
[58:21.480 --> 58:24.120]  of the screen, and really like, in a way
[58:24.120 --> 58:26.280]  that what 3D Touch is currently doing,
[58:26.280 --> 58:29.400]  but if you can actually feel depth,
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.480]  which you can sort of with 3D Touch, but not really,
[58:33.480 --> 58:36.760]  and it requires a much bigger touch target area.
[58:36.760 --> 58:39.680]  But if you could feel depth on those tiny little keys,
[58:39.680 --> 58:41.860]  like that is potentially a game changer
[58:41.860 --> 58:43.040]  for mobile keyboards.
[58:43.040 --> 58:46.520]  And it's, you know, it would have to be done exactly right
[58:46.520 --> 58:47.560]  or feel like a gimmick.
[58:47.560 --> 58:51.560]  And right now, the Taptic Engine does feel a little static,
[58:51.560 --> 58:53.280]  but the potential is there.
[58:53.280 --> 58:55.920]  The potential is there, and you know, as I said,
[58:55.920 --> 58:58.320]  I can tell it's not ready yet,
[58:58.320 --> 59:00.120]  but I still want a third-party keyboard
[59:00.120 --> 59:02.440]  that just doesn't all haptic keyboard just for fun,
[59:02.440 --> 59:04.240]  because I think it would be a blast.
[59:06.880 --> 59:08.960]  I can't help but think it's coming.
[59:08.960 --> 59:12.560]  I do think, I've said this many times over the years,
[59:12.560 --> 59:17.560]  that it often matters what's tacked on five, 10 years,
[59:19.520 --> 59:21.680]  15 years after something was created,
[59:21.680 --> 59:25.200]  as opposed to what was there from the outset.
[59:25.200 --> 59:28.200]  And the Force Touch and the haptic feedback, to me,
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.220]  has that sort of, it would be different and more pervasive
[59:32.220 --> 59:35.160]  if it had been there right from the original iPhone.
[59:35.160 --> 59:38.240]  You know, it's like, in the original iPhone,
[59:38.240 --> 59:40.240]  every single control,
[59:40.240 --> 59:43.080]  every single standard user interface control
[59:43.080 --> 59:47.600]  was reimagined from what that looks like on the Mac
[59:47.600 --> 59:50.560]  to accommodate the difference between a touchscreen
[59:50.560 --> 59:51.840]  with a big fat finger,
[59:51.840 --> 59:56.160]  as opposed to a mouse and pointer system
[59:56.160 --> 59:58.340]  where you have this pixel-level precision.
[59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.580]  So things like the Datepicker, right,
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.180]  where you get the spinning control on iOS,
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.920]  as opposed to a drop-down menu that you get on.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.920]  I think that if they had 3D Touch from the beginning,
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.040]  every control would have some sort of haptic feedback.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.240]  Whereas like you said now,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.240]  it seems like half the teams went through
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.980]  and added some haptic feedback,
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.920]  and some of the other teams just were like, ah.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.960]  Yeah, they're like, okay.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.880]  There's pretty much no haptic feedback in music,
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.840]  for example.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.600]  Music is another one of those that has a card
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.440]  that kind of flies up that could use it.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.480]  But yeah, there's not a,
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.040]  I really think it's an early,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.920]  we're seeing it in kind of its early days.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.080]  And did you get a chance,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.260]  there was an app on one of the demo phones at the event
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.880]  a few weeks back that was a music app
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.080]  where you could play keys.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:53.920]  Yes, yes.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.760]  Yeah, and it would, I have no idea what that app is,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.880]  but I really wanna find it.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.340]  I might be able to get that for you.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.700]  Yeah, I could probably email somebody
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.400]  and get that information.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.640]  But I just remember playing around with that
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.600]  and having a light bulb go off in my head
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.800]  and being like, this is what Apple's waiting for,
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.580]  is they're not, they're, yes, playing with it themselves,
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.080]  but what they're really waiting to see
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.440]  is how third party apps take advantage of haptic.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.940]  And also, I imagine where they can steal.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.200]  Like, not necessarily steal as in a bad way,
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.460]  but steal as in the pull to refresh kind of thing,
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.600]  where watch how third parties are doing it
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.340]  and see if they're coming up with better ideas
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.360]  than the internal team is coming up with.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.840]  See if they wanna try something different
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.440]  that we've never thought of before.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.680]  Yeah, so the, I don't know what the name of it was,
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.460]  but the demo app they had put up like a piano keyboard
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.960]  that was the width of the iPhone.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.560]  And it not only gave you the feedback,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.160]  the feedback seemed to correlate
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.640]  to the location of the key you were pressing.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.480]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.720]  That's the main thing, is it really did feel like,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.320]  it wasn't just that the phone was clicking,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.520]  it was that the key on the screen was clicking.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.820]  Yeah, it's not just, it's not a rumble controller,
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.440]  it's a specificity controller.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.440]  And you could change how heavy your press was,
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.800]  and you could feel that difference,
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.760]  which that was the really like,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.240]  again, it's the pressure combined with haptics,
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.520]  which really makes this not just like
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.880]  a Nintendo rumble controller,
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.700]  but something much more powerful.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.860]  Let me take another break here.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.260]  Thank our next sponsor.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.660]  And we'll go on from there.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.700]  It's our good friends at Backblaze.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.680]  You guys know Backblaze.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.680]  They provide unlimited native backup for Mac and PC.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.340]  You get started with no credit card, no risk,
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.340]  a free 15 day trial at backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.180]  Here's the way it works.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.820]  You go there, you download their software,
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.500]  you install it, you get a nice little panel
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.100]  and system prefs, and it just starts backing up
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.140]  everything on your Mac to their servers in the cloud.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:06.980]  Everything.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.300]  It's not just like your home folder
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.260]  or your documents folder or something like that.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.820]  You don't have to tell it.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.820]  It'll just back upload everything.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.480]  And then if you have external drives,
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.900]  it backs those up too.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.780]  And there is no limit,
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.700]  and you don't have to pay more to get more.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.040]  You just have to wait longer for everything to upload.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.880]  That's it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.340]  It's just, and then what do you pay
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.060]  once your 15 day free trial's up?
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.220]  Five bucks a month, that's it, per Mac.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.680]  So if you have two Macs, you can back them both up.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.440]  You'll pay 10 bucks.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.280]  Great deal.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.020]  Five bucks a month.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.020]  No limits, unthrottled, offsite backup.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.020]  It is such a relief.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.900]  You will sleep so much better knowing
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.140]  that everything on your Mac is backed up somewhere offsite
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.500]  so that if some sort of catastrophe happens,
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:57.100]  if your Mac gets stolen, if you spill water all over it
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.080]  or something like that, you'll have an offsite backup.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.740]  Cannot tell you how great this service is.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.560]  I would recommend Backblaze to you
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.660]  even if they weren't a sponsor of the show,
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.180]  but I'm certainly happy that they are a sponsor of the show.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.340]  So go check them out.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.340]  You get a 15 day free trial, backblaze.com
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.920]  slash Daring Fireball.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.540]  One time I did a read for Backblaze and I said,
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.160]  Blackblaze, and I think that's what I said,
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.340]  and they went and registered the domain.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.240]  Just in case.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.060]  Yeah.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.640]  It's not quite as bad as your botched Microsoft read.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.920]  Yeah, if you go to blackblaze.com,
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.580]  it'll just redirect you right to backblaze.com.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.560]  So you could probably use that
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.040]  and they'll know you're coming from the show too
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.640]  because I really doubt anybody else is mangled
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.480]  in that same way.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.880]  You were talking about the music app.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.040]  I hear something that I still don't get
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.960]  about going from one phone to another.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.580]  I don't understand how I'm supposed to get all my music
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.780]  from one to another.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:11.040]  It just seems to me like every time I back up my Mac,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.880]  here's how I do the phones.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.440]  I do it to the Mac through iTunes
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.800]  because I think it's faster than iCloud.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.200]  So I take my old phone or the review unit phone
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.480]  I use for two weeks, back it up to my Mac,
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.960]  and then I take the new phone
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.100]  and go through the initial setup and say restore from iTunes
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.200]  and then I connect it to my Mac and I restore it.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.000]  And then it seems like none of my music is here.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.920]  It's all got the cloud.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.800]  And I don't know if it's because I'm using Apple Music,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.840]  but I had all of my music.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.240]  What I would like is to have my entire personal music library
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.400]  on the phone for all time.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.480]  And then any time I'm anywhere on an airplane
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.240]  or something like that, I've got all my music.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.840]  And I would like to use Apple Music to listen
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.720]  to anything else that I want to listen to
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.760]  that I don't maybe don't own as a thing.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.680]  And it doesn't seem to me like I know how to do that.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.400]  Do you understand?
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.520]  I do, I completely understand.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.240]  But only because I've spent like practically a year
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.640]  troubleshooting Apple Music.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.000]  Can you explain this to me?
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.600]  If you can explain this to me,
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.400]  this will be worth the entire episode of the show.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.080]  Okay, so from what I understand,
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.240]  when you restore from a backup of your phone,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.840]  your previous phone had all of your music locally,
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.320]  or had it, or ideally that's what you want.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.920]  Okay, so you had downloaded all of your local music
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.200]  previously to your previous phone,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.560]  and for some reason it did not restore with that music.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.400]  Correct.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.240]  Is that right?
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.080]  Yes.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.960]  Okay, so I'm, just as a guess,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.360]  because you have iCloud Music Library installed,
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.640]  I'm thinking that Apple says,
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.360]  well, you know, John obviously wants his apps restored,
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.520]  and so we're going to make a,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.880]  actually no, with an iTunes backup now,
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.120]  do you still get all of your apps from the iTunes backup,
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.440]  or does it make it download them from the cloud?
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.480]  I still have to download them from the cloud.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.360]  And there, that's the trick then.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.240]  So that's their argument there,
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.160]  is that to make your iTunes backup faster,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.680]  and not stress about it so much,
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.200]  we're going to save your information,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.640]  and make sure that all of the data for your apps is all fine
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.040]  and when you restore your apps,
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.840]  that data gets plugged back in.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.400]  But we are not going to take the time
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.600]  to download multiple gigabytes of apps to iTunes,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.920]  and make your restore longer.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.240]  And probably the same exact thing applies to your music,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.600]  where it's like, you may have downloaded 40 gigs of music
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.920]  onto your old iPhone 7 review unit,
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.320]  but we're not going to wait while 40 gigs of music
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.200]  is backed up to this phone, or backed up to your iMac,
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.920]  and then transferred back to your new iPhone 7.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.480]  That's gonna be too long for you,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.360]  you're gonna get frustrated, it's gonna take half the day.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.280]  So instead, we're just gonna say,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.600]  okay, if you wanna redownload that music,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.860]  you can from iCloud Music Library.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.860]  What I don't get is, when you restore an iPhone,
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.760]  your apps all download automatically.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.560]  I'm surprised that it wouldn't download your,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.400]  redownload your music from the cloud,
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.280]  because it knows, again, it has that metadata,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.280]  it knows what you had prior.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.080]  So in theory, that should happen as well,
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.800]  if we're following that same model from the apps.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.400]  But it doesn't sound like it's currently doing that,
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.400]  and that's a point of contention.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.680]  What I will say that Apple has done
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.480]  that's much better this time around
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.300]  with iCloud Music Library than prior,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.180]  well, A, they've made it so that
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.480]  if you're subscribed to Apple Music,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.380]  your music gets uploaded to iCloud Music Library
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.880]  as your music, so there's no more DRM,
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.840]  which is very helpful,
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.800]  unless you're downloading an Apple Music song.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.940]  And that also allows them to essentially split your library.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.760]  So now, there's a setting,
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.240]  I'm just going into settings really quickly
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.880]  so I can remember what it's actually called,
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.520]  so I don't misquote it here.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.280]  But inside Apple Music,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.460]  there's now a setting called Add Playlist Songs.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.360]  And essentially, when you add music
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.900]  from the Apple Music Library,
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.360]  if you don't have Add Playlist Songs enabled,
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.720]  those songs will just go into an Apple Music playlist.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.520]  So they won't contaminate your library.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.920]  They'll just kind of hang out
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.160]  sort of in an Apple Music repository,
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.900]  rather than messing around with your local library.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.720]  At least, that's how it worked in the beta.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.220]  Hopefully, it hasn't changed.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.360]  I like that, all right.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.940]  Yeah, exactly, that's a really nice subtle thing,
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.320]  and I believe it's turned off by default.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.360]  It's on online, and I don't remember turning it on,
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.200]  so I don't know.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.920]  All right, then maybe, yeah,
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.160]  it may have changed in the beta.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.800]  But that is one option for kind of separating your two.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.880]  And then also, of course,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.700]  there's the Downloaded Music option.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.120]  I think, I feel like there was an easier way
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.160]  to download a bunch of albums.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.640]  I thought so, too, but I didn't find it, and.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.040]  Well, oh, you know, I mean, it also is probably,
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.840]  I'm like, I'm tapping on my various albums,
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.880]  and I'm like, maybe I have all of my albums
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.800]  stored locally on this phone.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.960]  Maybe that happened, because I'm tapping on all of them,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.720]  and it says Delete from Library.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.000]  Of course, that may be delete.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.280]  Yeah, oh, yeah, download, there we go.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.560]  So you can download by album, and you can download by,
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.080]  no, you can't download by artist.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.800]  I would just like to say download everything.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.120]  Download all, yeah.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.640]  I wonder if you can do that in the music settings.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.240]  And now we're just troubleshooting on the air.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.060]  This is great.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.440]  Well, we'll look at that later.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.920]  Anyway, I wish, I think that Apple Music
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.120]  is much better designed this year than last.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.720]  I think it's a very promising sign that they got it,
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.200]  that what was so confusing last year.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.440]  I still feel like it has a long way to go.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.560]  It really does.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.800]  There is automatic, yeah.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.460]  Optimized storage is now a toggle, which is really nice.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.220]  So you can just keep your downloaded music
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.360]  as your downloaded music.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.920]  Right, and that's the feature where,
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.740]  if your device is running low on space,
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.320]  it'll start removing.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.240]  Culling.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.840]  Culling music that you haven't played recently,
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.900]  which is a pretty good feature,
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.680]  and only stuff that you can re-download if you need to.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.360]  Yeah, I really wish there was an easier way
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.880]  to download all music.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.320]  It's a little frustrating.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.840]  I still feel like, at a fundamental level,
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.600]  they're trying to do away with the distinction
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.000]  between my music, my personal, the music collection
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.240]  I started building when Napster first collected.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.640]  I first started downloading MP3s or turning my old CD
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.560]  collection into MP3s, and Apple Music, this thing
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.240]  that I pay for that has everything.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.840]  I just want all of my music, which now easily fits,
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.800]  I forget how big my total music library is,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.280]  but it used to be in the old days when the eight gigabyte
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.960]  was the big iPhone, couldn't have it all.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.640]  And now it's a joke.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.800]  I don't know, if I've got like 10 gigs of music
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.640]  or something like that.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.640]  Well, a 256 gigabyte iPhone can have it all easily.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.460]  And then some.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.300]  Right.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.200]  And record some 4K video too.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.840]  Right, and so then no matter where I am,
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.760]  if I have no network access whatsoever,
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.000]  I'm in an elevator on an airplane,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.720]  I know that I at least have all the music that it's my music,
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.160]  and I can play it all right now.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.440]  So anyway, that's the way it should be.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.560]  Maybe when they finally redesign iTunes, ha ha ha.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.920]  Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.800]  All right, so did you end up buying a phone for yourself yet?
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.360]  I did.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.240]  What did you get?
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.760]  I ended up buying a jet black iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.320]  And you have it already?
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.560]  Well, I have it because I ordered it.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.240]  I didn't know that Renee and I were
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.080]  going to be getting review units until a couple days
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080]  before the launch.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.400]  So I ordered mine at 3 AM, 3.01 AM on the Apple Store app
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.640]  from bed because I wasn't sure otherwise
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.920]  when I would be getting a phone.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.280]  So I went ahead and I was just like,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.240]  I really hate the Plus, sorry, hashtag Mike was wrong.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.720]  But I wanted the camera features and I
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.040]  knew that if I was going to be writing about the camera
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.000]  features, I kind of needed the bigger phone.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.840]  But I was like, you know, I also have 14 days,
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.320]  so if I really despise the giant phone carrying,
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.120]  then I can return it and go back to an iPhone 7
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.880]  or wait like a million weeks to get an iPhone 7 properly.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.880]  So I have that and then I have an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.760]  Plus that are my review units.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.040]  So I actually have jet black iPhones in both models.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.160]  No one come rob me.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.400]  You must have gotten your order in like at 3.01.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.720]  That's Eastern time.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.600]  Yeah, I was probably one of the first people,
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.280]  at least in my Twitter feed, who actually got the app open
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.800]  and showing on the ordering screen.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.760]  And I still was pushed out a week.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.000]  I didn't get my 7 Plus until, I don't know,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.560]  the middle of last week.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560]  I think that was the first batch, I really do.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.840]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.160]  Well, they went quickly.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.080]  I think like two people I know got them on release day.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.720]  And well, was it the Plus size?
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.480]  Because it seems like the Plus jet black.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.600]  Wow, that's amazing.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600]  They must have really been like in the first.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.440]  Like right on the, yeah.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.920]  I had a lot of trouble with the app.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.000]  And in years past, the app always
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.120]  seemed like that was the way to go, use the iPhone
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.880]  app to order.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.400]  So I switched like 10 minutes in to,
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.080]  after 10 minutes of things not going well,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.200]  switched to the website.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.240]  And the website actually worked perfectly.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240]  I just was like, bloop, bloop, bloop, new iPhone,
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.040]  bloop, bloop, bloop, another new iPhone.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.880]  I had no problems with the app once I got it to actually load.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.600]  My initial thing was just, I mean,
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.840]  I was doing probably the horrible thing
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.480]  that no Apple server tech wants to hear,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:17.120]  which is as soon as 3001 hit, I kept on force quitting the app
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.880]  and then reloading, force quitting, reloading,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.960]  force quitting, reloading.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.440]  It's like the horrible version of the command refresh on a Mac.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.960]  And I got through probably 302, 303.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.000]  And other people were trying to do that and didn't
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.800]  get through until 315, I think.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.280]  It wasn't clear if you just left the app open
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.040]  whether it would reload.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.320]  Yeah, no, it's true.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.840]  It wasn't clear.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.680]  My assumption was that it would.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.080]  But since I don't know force quitting,
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.520]  I know it's going to reload, so therefore I force quit.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.880]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.600]  It's the same principle way back when with the live blogs.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.960]  I don't know.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.480]  If they just would have printed on the store
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.240]  was down before they enabled it, if they would have just
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.720]  put on that page saying that the store is down,
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.560]  that there is no need to refresh,
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.280]  then I would have trusted them and I would have left it open.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.360]  But instead, it also says Mac rumors,
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.760]  I don't know if you saw this this morning,
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:20.280]  has a report from Ming-Chi Kuo, the supply chain guru,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.560]  that Jet Black models are suffering from a quote,
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.360]  low casing production yield rate,
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.960]  meaning 30% to 40% of the units that they are making
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.080]  don't pass Apple's quality standards.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.680]  I don't think there's any difference between the regular
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.120]  size and plus on that.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.440]  No, no, or at least there isn't anything in his data
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.880]  that was released to Mac rumors.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.160]  But what I do think, I'm not surprised by it
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.400]  given how tetchy Jet Black is to begin with
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.320]  and the deals with scratches and everything else.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.280]  But specifically, I don't know if you noticed this,
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.320]  you have at least one Jet Black review model, right?
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.440]  I have a Jet Black review model
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.920]  and the one I bought is Jet Black.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.160]  Is Jet Black, yeah.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.880]  The thing that we were noticing and I'm more
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.720]  is that the unlike pretty much every other model
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.960]  of iPhone 7, there's a little bit of a,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.240]  like a prudence for the SIM card.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.600]  If you put your finger on the side
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.240]  with the Jet Black iPhone,
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.960]  you've got a little bit of a bump there.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.200]  Whereas if you do that on anything
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.840]  like on another iPhone 7, like on a matte iPhone 7,
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.280]  you don't really feel that so much.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.240]  And I have to think that there are little bits,
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.200]  little things like that with the anodization,
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.120]  especially because of the way they do this
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.000]  and the double anodization process with,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.160]  you know, I'm going to get it wrong
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.640]  if I try and describe it in detail,
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.280]  so I'm just going to avoid it.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.800]  But I mean, there's a lot of technology
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.000]  that goes into making this phone look the way it does,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.240]  which is honestly kind of magical
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.640]  in terms of like how ridiculous it ends up looking.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.240]  If I go into full Princess and the P mode,
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.160]  I would claim, and I think I could do this blindfolded,
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.000]  that my review unit, iPhone 7 in Jet Black,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.240]  the SIM card prudence is almost indistinguishable.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:22.400]  And on this one that I now own, it is noticeable.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.680]  Not like I am complaining about it.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.080]  It's not, yeah.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.560]  But it is slightly different.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.400]  Yeah.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.680]  And I imagine all of them are slightly different.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.080]  Like on my review iPhone 7,
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.080]  it is much more noticeable than on my 7 Plus.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.160]  There's a definite cutout.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.720]  So are you happy that you ordered Jet Black for yourself?
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.160]  Oh yeah, without a question.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.160]  I was a little nervous about it initially
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.160]  because I really wasn't sure how badly it would scratch up
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.160]  and whether or not the material finish was good.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.440]  The review finish would be enough
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.040]  that I would feel comfortable keeping it caseless,
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.840]  especially with the 7 Plus being as massive as it is.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.040]  But I have been rocking the review unit in a case
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.280]  because I generally try and not to destroy Apple's materials.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.160]  I'm the same way I treat my review units
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.360]  better than the ones I own.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.480]  And I know some of the other reviewers don't.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.520]  They're like, yeah, what the hell is a review unit?
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.960]  Yeah, the only thing I've done to the poor review unit
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.000]  is made it film underwater a bunch of times
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.840]  and it seems to be okay.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.040]  Good phone.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.640]  My 7 Plus I got in Jet Black, no regrets.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.920]  I love the tactile finish.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.240]  I've got probably, I don't know.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.160]  The thing is I know I've got a ton of scratches
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.800]  on this thing, but unless I'm looking at it in direct light,
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.120]  I really can't see them.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.920]  That's kind of the beauty
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.000]  and the curse of the Jet Black finish
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.480]  is that in sunlight or in direct light,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.080]  you can see every single scratch and bemoan it and cry
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.640]  and have it hurt your heart.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.840]  But in every other lighting and just by holding it
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.040]  in your hand, you can't feel the scratches on the casing.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.960]  You can't really notice them.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.280]  And even in direct sunlight, it just, it looks,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.680]  again, it's starting to age well
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.920]  as opposed to just looking like,
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.880]  I could have seen a version of this,
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.840]  maybe not an Apple phone that had
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.960]  a sort of this kind of aluminum anodization
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.960]  where the second you get a scratch,
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.040]  you can start to see the aluminum under the black casing
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.000]  and it starts feeling really weird
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.520]  and just not ending up being a good experience.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.640]  But I'm pretty impressed in how they've ended up doing this.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.920]  That was the problem that people had
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.920]  with space black on the iPhone 5.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.560]  Oh, it was just scratching to white?
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.520]  Did they call it space black?
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.360]  I think so.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.400]  It might've just been black.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.120]  It might've been before the era of space blank.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.480]  Whatever it was, I liked it.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.720]  But when it did scratch or flake,
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.560]  especially around that beveled edge,
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.840]  it did show the pure, the more aluminum,
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.920]  naturally aluminum color underneath.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.200]  And I do feel like they've gone back to these dark colors
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.080]  because they've got it down now
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.120]  where the anodization layer is deep enough
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.520]  that even if you get a scratch,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.520]  the scratch is still the same color as the,
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.880]  as the, you know.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.720]  The regular, yeah.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.240]  Yeah, the virgin device, you know.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.880]  Yeah, I remember an Apple spokesperson talking to me
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.600]  about having the anodization,
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.160]  doing a double coat of anodization
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.520]  and having one of them seep into the pores of the aluminum,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.840]  which may or may not be an actual description
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.640]  of how the process actually works,
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.920]  but I can definitely believe that idea.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.760]  And we did, I will say, RIP Rene's review unit
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.400]  because he did drop it a couple of times
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.640]  into water at semi-high velocities,
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.120]  and there's a little bit of a chipped corner
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.240]  on one of the phones.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.320]  And that one, the very visible chip
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.840]  does have a lighter aluminum look to it
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.320]  than the just normal run-of-the-mill scratches.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.800]  But I think that's to be expected.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.320]  If you like, if you physically smash a corner of your phone
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.360]  into pavement, you're probably not gonna retain
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.720]  that beautiful finish.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.440]  But the screen didn't break, so.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.280]  It is a finish.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.560]  I mean, it's not magic.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.360]  It's not like they, you know, well, I don't know,
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.240]  maybe there's something, maybe they could make
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.640]  black aluminum, but it is a finish,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.640]  not just like the metal itself is that color.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.000]  I am 100% convinced I've made the right call
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.520]  for me personally.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.640]  It took me a long time, though.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.800]  Even when I recorded a week ago with Jim,
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.320]  I was still on the fence as to whether it was the right move,
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.360]  but now I'm convinced.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.120]  And I really don't even care what it looks like
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.280]  after a year, even if it's all scratched up.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:48.280]  The feel alone is enough for me
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:52.000]  because I've always been, I mean, it's,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.240]  starting with the 5, even, 5, 5S, 6, 6S.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.200]  So for four generations, I've always been a little unhappy
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.720]  with the slipperiness of the aluminum back.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.120]  And it was particularly bad with the iPhone 6.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.920]  And anecdotally broken, backed up by the fact
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.320]  that the iPhone 6 was the one and only iPhone
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.400]  I've ever cracked a screen on.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.240]  Yep.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.520]  And I remember last year, with the 6S, asking,
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.560]  when I got the review unit and had the briefing,
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.560]  I said, this feels more tactile to me.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.840]  Did you guys change something,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.080]  or is it just that my personal old iPhone has worn,
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.200]  and they denied it.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.960]  They said, oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.880]  It's like the weird way that when Apple
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.480]  doesn't wanna talk about something,
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.880]  they won't deny, they won't say no,
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.920]  they won't say you're crazy.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.440]  They'll say, it's interesting you would say so.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.000]  No, I don't think we've done anything.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.840]  But I think they did.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.720]  Nothing that we're willing to disclose.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.840]  Right, and I just think that they didn't wanna say
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.360]  that the old one was slippery,
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.960]  so they didn't wanna say the new one is less slippery.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.160]  But it clearly was to me, and it seems like everybody
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.240]  I know who's had both backs it up.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.280]  But the difference with Jeff Black is just night and day.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.360]  It's just not slippery at all.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.520]  And that to me is like, it just feels so much better
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.680]  coming in and out of my pocket.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.960]  I'm so much more certain that I'm not going to fat finger
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.120]  the phone, that it's worth it.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.800]  Somebody posted a picture on Twitter the other day
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.680]  showing their old, either very original
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.200]  or like first or second year iPod.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.040]  When they were.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:27.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.280]  I forget who posted the picture,
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.400]  but the back of the iPod was a very shiny,
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.560]  polished, mirrored aluminum,
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.640]  and they all got scratched to hell.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.640]  Oh yeah, the original case.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.200]  Right, that it, nobody complained.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.880]  We've gotten to the point now where,
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.760]  and you know, if your personality type is the such
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.800]  that you, the idea of these quote unquote micro abrasions
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.600]  bothers you, it seems to me that's very clearly
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.840]  half of the reason why they have the regular Black
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.880]  in addition to Jeff Black.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.120]  I think the other half being the aforementioned
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.920]  production problems with Jeff Black.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.760]  But it's, you know, if you're bothered by the idea
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.760]  of a easily micro abrasioned finish, don't get it, you know.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.280]  Yeah, no one is forcing you to get the Jeff Black iPhone,
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.520]  but if you don't care so much about resale value,
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.360]  and I think that is a big concern for folks,
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.520]  especially overseas, is you know, I'm gonna get this phone,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.040]  but I'm gonna keep it in pristine condition for a year
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.080]  and then able to resell it.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.760]  And once the Apple upgrade program I think floats out
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.440]  to more countries and more, you know, more areas,
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.840]  that will become less of an issue, maybe, possibly.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.240]  Although, I mean, it's still, you're talking about reselling
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.280]  into the gray market, which is a whole different question.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.520]  But that's the only reason why I could think
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.080]  to avoid the Jeff Black or to get the Jeff Black
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.000]  and then immediately put it into a case.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.720]  Because you can, you know, my review unit,
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.000]  my iPhone 7 Jeff Black has basically been in a Sena case
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.080]  since the day I got it, or the day after I got it,
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.920]  and it has maybe one or two scratches on the back.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.800]  And then the one night that I kept it out of its case
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.800]  to do some photo tests, this is my own damn fault.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.600]  I had also gotten a brand new nylon band,
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.400]  and I had taken it out of its, you know,
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.640]  out of the packaging from the Apple store,
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.840]  and I'd put the nylon band in my pocket,
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.040]  and I put the iPhone 7 in my pocket,
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.200]  and the nylon band's buckle rubbed up
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.440]  against the front upper corner of the poor iPhone 7.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.440]  So it has this now very, very smoothed in set of scratches
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.440]  from that nylon band buckle,
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.840]  just kind of etching its way in there.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.240]  And it doesn't, again, you can't,
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.640]  you cannot tell that it's scratched at all
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.320]  unless you catch the light,
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.480]  and then it's this like circle of doom here.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.520]  But otherwise, you know, eh, it looks fine.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.840]  I do feel that the term microabrasion,
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.680]  it's slightly euphemistic, but I feel like it's warranted,
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.520]  because for me, the definition between a scratch
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.960]  and a microabrasion is these microabrasions,
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.640]  and this is all I've seen on both of the ones I have here,
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.720]  are exactly like you said.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.720]  You have to catch the light at the right angle
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.120]  and look for them, and then you can see them.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.560]  But you can't feel them with your skin,
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.040]  and you can't even feel them with like your fingernail.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.080]  And to me, a scratch is something that you can see
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:28.080]  in regular light and or something that you can feel
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.360]  with your skin or your fingernail.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.360]  Mm-hmm, there's a, I got a scratch on my iPhone 6S Plus
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.760]  on the screen that is very noticeable,
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.680]  that's like a fingernail-type scratch.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.720]  And I, you know, this, I've put the 7 Plus
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.560]  since I got it through some fairly hefty,
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.120]  like it was out on the beach doing some photography
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.720]  for my upcoming Apple Watch review.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.640]  And I managed to walk away from this thing
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.960]  not only being near the beach,
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.560]  but also being dipped in the water
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.040]  and like swum around with sand particles
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.520]  and dust particles and everything else,
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.680]  and it came out of it pretty much pristine.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.440]  So I really think that although the yield rate
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.800]  may be low on the jet black,
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.200]  it's probably for a good reason.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.880]  And I kind of feel for Apple's shipping department
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.840]  and their production lines,
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.480]  because I'm sure having the yield rate below
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.280]  is a pain in the ass for their profit margins
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.160]  and everything else, but it's resulting
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.600]  in hopefully a much better overall product
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.960]  for people when they finally get them into their hands.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.400]  Yeah, and I've said this before,
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.040]  I will probably say it again all year long,
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.200]  I actually feel bad for regular black because I love it.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.040]  I love the regular black.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.640]  Oh, it's gorgeous, I almost got it.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.760]  I wish that they'd come out with it a year ago
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.160]  so that I would have had a year
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.240]  where I got to use the regular black
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.760]  because I like it so much more than space grays,
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.920]  sort of am I dark, am I light, eh, I'm sort of in the middle.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.400]  Shrug.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.200]  I really feel bad that this new finish
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.240]  that I absolutely love that I didn't,
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.400]  I'm not gonna actually own.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.240]  Here's my hope.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.080]  My hope is that they bring the exact same
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.400]  flat black aluminum finish to the MacBook Pro.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.160]  Yes, I would love that.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.280]  And I do, I really like the flat black aluminum.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.000]  I thought that was the phone that I was gonna get
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.760]  until I touched the jet black.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.000]  And I think yield rate and cost aside,
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.600]  even if it was the exact same yield rate and cost for Apple,
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.680]  I think jet black would be wrong for the MacBook Pro.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.080]  I feel like you're, you know, like, okay,
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.960]  so there's fingerprints that you can wipe off on this,
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.880]  but the fingerprints are always pointed away from me,
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.280]  right, on the back of the phone.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.280]  Whereas on the palm rest on your MacBook,
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.000]  I think it would be really ugly.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.400]  Well, also, you remember though,
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.360]  I think about Apple's history with black laptops
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.560]  and I think about the Wall Street
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.280]  and I think about the black MacBook and all of those.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.080]  I mean, have they ever really made a glossy computer
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.080]  aside from the iBooks outer shell?
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.240]  No, I don't think so.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.520]  I just think it's glossy is just wrong for a MacBook.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.080]  Yeah, it just doesn't feel right.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:06.920]  So that's my hope.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.680]  My hope is they bring that same black to the MacBook Pros
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.600]  and then I'll get to own it.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.960]  Yeah, oh, for sure.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.360]  That's, I would buy a new black Mac laptop in a heartbeat.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.280]  Yeah, I would buy one.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.400]  I'm so superficial.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.520]  I would buy one even if it didn't have any,
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.360]  if it was like, whoa, what's going on here?
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.200]  Exactly the same.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200]  This is a two-year-old Intel CPU.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.920]  I'd be like, I don't care.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.720]  It's black, it's mine.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.200]  Let me thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.960]  I still have more I want to ask you about,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.680]  but it's a good time to break.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.840]  I want to thank Automattic.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.160]  This is, Automattic makes the little adapter.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.040]  It's like a dongle, a dingus.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.720]  It's like a little dingus and it turns your car,
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.160]  whether it's new, whether it's kind of old,
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.240]  into a smart connected car.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.760]  Every single car made since like 1997
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.680]  has the standard port somewhere under the dash.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.680]  And it's where, when you go to the mechanic
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.560]  or you go to your, wherever you go to get your car inspected
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.160]  and stuff like that, they plug in
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.720]  and it's a standard adapter
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.880]  and it's where they get all the diagnostic information
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.760]  from your car's computers.
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.240]  Automattic is a dongle that you plug in there on your own.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.080]  You plug it in yourself and it gives you
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.880]  so much more information about your car.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.200]  You probably didn't even know your car
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.600]  could give you this information.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.680]  I've had one for a while.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.120]  I love it, it's great.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.960]  That's the old one though.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:37.280]  They have a new, Automattic has just launched Automattic Pro.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.120]  It is their new unlimited 3G car adapter,
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.240]  which has no monthly fees or subscription.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.360]  So you think that's too good to be true.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.760]  Well, Amazon's been doing the same thing with Kindle
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.960]  for a while where you can get a 3G Kindle
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:52.320]  and you don't pay for the 3G service.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.840]  I don't know how they worked out this deal,
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.320]  but they worked it out.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.960]  So now your Automattic, you plug it in your car,
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.860]  it's got 3G networking.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.400]  You don't pay, it's just part of,
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.480]  it's just built into the price of the device.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.640]  And then you can do things like
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.880]  if you forget where you parked
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.440]  or like if you share a car with somebody else in your house
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.800]  and you don't know where they parked,
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.160]  just launch the app and it'll tell you
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.360]  right where the car is.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.100]  They have so many things in the app.
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:20.540]  It's obvious stuff like your gas mileage
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.800]  and what kind of miles per gallon you're getting.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.520]  And it can give you tips on how to drive
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.420]  to be more efficient with stuff like that.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.400]  But you can totally nerd out with Automattic.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.560]  They connect to IFTTT so you can get
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.160]  an almost endless customization.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.900]  Just things like connecting to,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.160]  if you have a Nest thermostat at your house or Amazon Echo,
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.840]  you can do things like once your car
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.800]  is within five minutes of home,
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.900]  change the temperature in the house.
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.740]  You don't do anything, you just set it up
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.240]  and then it happens automatically.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.240]  It is really, really great.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.280]  And it's just amazing because you don't,
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.320]  there's no monthly fees or anything like that.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.640]  Not just for the cell service, but for the device.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.760]  You just buy it, own it, and you just use it for free.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.040]  It is so great.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:07.860]  What a great deal.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:12.860]  Normally, it costs $129.95, so let's call it $130.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:18.020]  Use this exclusive offer code though,

[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.360]  at an unbelievable price.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.660]  You can even, even as Apple Watch support, unbelievable.

[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.680]  You've been doing a lot of stuff with the cameras,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.300]  you and Renee with the iPhone.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.040]  And I saw last night, I think it was last night,
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.160]  but it was certainly over the weekend,
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.960]  where you were doing like product review photography
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.000]  of Apple Watch and had, what did you say?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.720]  It was like, is it a glider?
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.200]  What was it that you were talking about?
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.680]  Oh yeah, yeah, so a slider.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.520]  Slider.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.560]  So yeah, with a, and actually I didn't even know
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.080]  this was the professional term for it
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.000]  until we were filming with Michael Fisher,
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.600]  who used to work for Pocket now, someone,
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.400]  and now works on his own YouTube channel.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.700]  And he brought these big giant slider rigs
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.320]  to put his camera on, which are basically
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.440]  exactly what they sound like,
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.920]  where you put your camera on a big horizontal thing,
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.080]  and then you move your camera along the slider reel
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.120]  while you're filming.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.600]  And it makes for those beautiful, nice pans
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.600]  that you see in product videos,
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.600]  or like the slow zooms, it's like a tiny, steady camera rig
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.600]  for the ground, or for a table.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.000]  And I don't have any of that equipment,
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.240]  because I do some videography, but I'm not,
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.240]  I generally am only doing videos for specific events.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.520]  And I think it was last year,
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.000]  when we started experimenting with the idea
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.920]  of could we shoot a review video on a phone,
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.760]  I did the iPhone 6S review entirely on my iPhone
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.600]  as a fun, just a throwback,
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.520]  after Rene did his official review.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.880]  And in order to shoot those beautiful,
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.520]  pretty device shots, I'm like, well, I can't shoot this,
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.280]  even with my, I have a couple of different
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.640]  pseudo steady cam rigs for the phone,
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.240]  and even with those rigs, I can't shoot a nice, slow pan
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.400]  without it looking jittery and too much
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.880]  for Final Cut to fix.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.020]  And so while I was filming this stuff,
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.800]  I had kind of an epiphany last year,
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.400]  and I'm like, wait a second, what if I shoot in slow-mo?
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.380]  So I flipped over to the slow-mo slider,
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:06.220]  and I made sure it was,
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:09.280]  I think it's like 120 frames per second, 1080p,
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.640]  and then just shot the same pan,
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.000]  but shot it in slow-mo with my rig.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.820]  And when you play it back in slow motion,
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:23.040]  it looks almost identical to using those sliders.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.680]  I've just done it, I've put a link to your tweet,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.160]  which has the video in the show notes, and people can go.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.200]  I was blown away, honestly, I just,
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.840]  part of it is that I'm like, I'm an idiot,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.340]  and I still run a website, like it's 2001,
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.240]  and there are no videos, but.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.480]  Probably for the best.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.880]  I feel like one of the, it made me realize that,
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.720]  like I wouldn't use it, I wouldn't have a reason
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.600]  to do it for that, like a product review shot
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.260]  of Apple Watch, but I realized, looking at that,
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:57.520]  that I'm vastly underusing slow motion video in period,
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.360]  just for my personal use.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.020]  It's like it hasn't really gotten into my head
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.560]  that I have an amazing slow motion camera,
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.520]  and that it can make all sorts of things interesting.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.720]  I tend to only think of the most obvious thing,
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:16.760]  like catching my kid at the beach,
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.480]  jumping off a rock into the ocean.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.480]  Well, shoot that in slow-mo, that'll look cool.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.960]  But that's like the most obvious,
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.440]  that's like the first thing everybody thinks of.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.760]  That's your traditional slow-mo shot.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.640]  Right, you can get, like for just shooting
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.380]  like a panorama or something like that,
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.640]  I think it smooths out the motion in an amazing way.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.960]  It's just unbelievable to me that this video
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.560]  in your tweet was shot with a phone.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.760]  I know, and that's the.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.440]  Without like some kind of complicated tracking rig,
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:48.120]  slider, whatever they call it, it really is amazing.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.580]  That, and on top of that, that particular shot,
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:52.460]  that was shot freehand, that wasn't even shot
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.240]  with a stabilizer rig or anything.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.160]  That was just shot with my hands next to a tree.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.560]  That doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.160]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.080]  Yeah, it's.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.160]  It's a really, really great shot.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.400]  Thank you, I have really been having a ton of fun
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.300]  with these cameras, not only with the 7 Plus
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.920]  and portrait mode and all of that stuff,
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.160]  but even with video, I think one of the things
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.380]  that people are kinda discounting is that the iPhone 7
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:23.880]  with optical image stabilization becomes pretty great
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.960]  for low light photography, but becomes amazing
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.200]  for video all of a sudden.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.620]  Like the iPhone 7 is now a camera that I feel
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:36.160]  as comfortable shooting with as I did with my 6S Plus,
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.580]  which prior to that, the 6S Plus was the only thing
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.000]  I would use to film anything with,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  because it looked too shaky and it didn't have the same,
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.720]  you know, the right temperature and color tone
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.580]  that I wanted because the OIS just, you know,
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:52.420]  it wasn't there.
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.160]  All it had was digital image stabilization.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.920]  And now that the 7 has that, that's a huge step up
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.080]  for anybody who wants to shoot video.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:02.940]  And then you combine that with the F1.8 aperture
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:05.120]  on the wide angle lens, and it means that you can shoot
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.780]  video in lower light situations.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.680]  It means that your slow-mo in lower light situations
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.520]  is gonna look better.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.400]  And that's even almost a bigger deal.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.000]  Because 240, unfortunately their 240 frames per second
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.320]  slow motion is still limited to 720p,
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.280]  which is kind of a bummer.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.480]  I was kind of hoping that they would bump up maybe,
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.920]  maybe we'd see 4K slow motion this year,
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.000]  but it's, you know, there's only so much,
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.680]  only so much you can do with a tiny, tiny sensors.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.280]  Well, 4K is a big jump.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.920]  I just getting, getting the 240 frames per second
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.280]  at 1080 would be another.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.380]  Well, exactly, exactly.
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:43.080]  I was hoping that we saw everything move up slightly one.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.800]  So maybe we got 4K at like 60 frames per second, right?
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.980]  And then we got, we still have 1080 at 120
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.520]  and maybe 1080 at 240 would have been really nice to see.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.520]  But even so, you can do 720p at 240 frames per second now.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.200]  And in a dark room, that used to be a non-starter.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.960]  It was just, you know, I would try and film,
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.680]  I used to do roller derby tests all the time
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.680]  for slow motion and the 240 frames per second option
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.360]  just was just, no, it wouldn't work in a dark,
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.320]  in any kind of like indoor practice space.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.040]  And now it's a legitimate option.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.420]  It's still not great because it's 720p,
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:25.380]  but you can actually, you can use it without feeling like
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.420]  it's the worst thing that you've ever done
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.880]  in your life with a camera.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.640]  Which is, I mean, that's not exactly high praise,
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.400]  but it's, there are some definite advances
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.280]  that come with both OIS on the 7,
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.600]  but also that larger aperture on both the 7 and the 7 Plus.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.320]  And the zoom feature, did you,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.900]  you linked to Austin Mann's adventure in Rwanda.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.520]  If you watch that video,
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.980]  that they shot that entire video on 7 Plus,
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.480]  which was kind of amazing to sort of imagine.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:04.400]  But on top of that, they did several times during the shoot,
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.040]  they had a video where they actually sort of jumped,
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.400]  not even a rack focus, but like jumped from the first,
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.400]  from the 1X lens to the 2X lens.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.200]  And there's a little bit of a software stutter
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.300]  in between the two, but overall,
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:24.280]  it's a really cool way to snap onto a subject.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.520]  And something that I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.440]  got used more often in photography.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.400]  Yeah, it's, it is, I'm trying not to talk it up
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.760]  because I'm not gonna use Plus personally.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.840]  So it hurts my heart to talk about.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.320]  You don't wanna talk about portrait mode
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.160]  and all of that fun stuff.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.100]  I do, I do, you know, gotta be a big boy.
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.620]  If I'm gonna, you know, use the small phone,
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.100]  I've gotta face up to it.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.180]  No, but it does, it is one of those things where I thought,
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:52.840]  oh, but this doesn't even work, you know,
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.740]  midway through a video, but it does.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.200]  And it is pretty cool.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:01.200]  I do think, I think Optic, sometimes with the camera stuff,
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.580]  it's like when you get all nerdy
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.820]  and start listing these, the technical specs, you know,
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.340]  everybody knows megapixels.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:10.780]  I think it's finally gotten through to almost everybody
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.740]  that megapixels is not a simple,
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.220]  the bigger the number, the better.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.700]  Quantity versus quality.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:21.000]  And it's, you know, there's the factors like noise,
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.540]  because you have more of these, you know, more light,
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.740]  you know, having fewer pixels,
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.780]  but having the pixels on the sensor be bigger
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:28.100]  so they each soak up more light
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.420]  is actually way better than having more pixels.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.100]  And you'll, even if your goal
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:34.140]  is to blow the picture up real big,
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.540]  you'll get a better image.
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:39.020]  Optical image stabilization is one of those things
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.660]  where it just, you know,
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.300]  everybody can kind of figure out what it means.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.200]  It's, you know, it's a very clear term.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.500]  And, you know, like the illustration that Apple uses
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.940]  where they show that the little lens
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:51.700]  sort of bouncing on a little suspended thing, you get it.
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:54.540]  But the practical effects of it are so dramatic,
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:56.220]  especially for video,
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:57.620]  because like on a still photography,
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:58.980]  you don't really, you may not know
[01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:00.920]  that optical image stabilization helped,
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.180]  because it just means you can get a clear picture
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:06.500]  with less light, but you may not realize,
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.900]  you don't have to realize that it is.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:11.300]  But with video, it really is a very clear difference.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.020]  In typical just consumer, you know, fashion,
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:19.300]  like you're at the soccer game for your kid,
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.660]  and you're just, you know,
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.780]  holding the phone out in front of you and panning it.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.540]  Or if you're walking, you know, especially walking, right?
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:29.300]  And even if you try to keep it stable,
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.120]  the motion that you get without optical image stabilization
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.120]  when you shoot video is really distracting visually.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.640]  It just looks unprofessional.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.320]  And the difference with OIS is so dramatic.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.140]  It's not like, oh, it really improves it a little bit.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:49.520]  It really does make it look like you've got a steady cam.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.680]  Like maybe you're not the world's best steady cam operator,
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.660]  but it does look like your phone is, you know,
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.820]  somehow floating through the air.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.380]  It's really remarkable,
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.900]  both in the shots that we did for the iPhone 7 review,
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.480]  and also the shots that I was having Rick help me with
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.760]  for the Apple Watch review.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.460]  There were a couple of shots where, again,
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:09.440]  he's free handing, walking backwards on a bike path
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.620]  while I'm talking.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:13.220]  And I get the, I take the initial video of that
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.900]  and put it into Final Cut Pro.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.980]  And I'm like, I'm going to click the stabilization button,
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.700]  and then I actually watch the video, and I'm like,
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.360]  this doesn't even need stable.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.480]  That's ridiculous.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.540]  That's not fair.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.540]  Like this, we've come so far.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:30.180]  And especially, I remember the first time I got to play
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:33.100]  with a phone that had OIS, which is, was the 6 Plus,
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.260]  I believe, was the first one.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:40.260]  Shooting video on the 6 Plus, specifically with Derby,
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.700]  and shooting video while being on roller skates
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:47.380]  and shooting somebody on roller skates,
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.680]  despite the little tiny bumps that happen
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.700]  when you're rolling on unpaved or badly paved concrete,
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.300]  it looked like I was basically running a $700 rig.
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:00.580]  And I remember the, two years before that,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.160]  when I actually had a Steadicam rig for the iPhone 4
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:08.980]  that I had gotten from Steadicam, as a review unit,
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.060]  when they were trying to market Steadicam things
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:16.120]  for the iPhone, and thinking, this iPhone,
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:21.120]  this iPhone 6 Plus shoots better, more stable video
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.500]  than the $200 Steadicam rig
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:28.580]  that I was playing around with all those years ago.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.420]  And that's crazy.
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:32.100]  Being a dedicated 4.7-inch iPhone user,
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.540]  not liking the Plus size,
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:36.760]  it bothered me a lot more last year
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.140]  when the Plus got OIS for video
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:41.660]  than it did in the previous year,
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:44.980]  where the Plus did have optical image stabilization,
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:46.260]  but only for stills.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:47.620]  It bothered me way less,
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.980]  because I've shot enough low-light stuff,
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:55.540]  amateur style, in my life where I know the tricks
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:58.880]  like resting the camera on a table or something
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.540]  so that it's not just my hand, in low light,
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:06.220]  ways to keep the camera as still as possible to do that.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:09.340]  I'm not saying my little resting the camera
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:11.940]  on something to hold it stable is as good as OIS,
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.300]  but I felt like I could compensate for stills.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:19.680]  But for video, there's no way to simulate it.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.940]  It's a fantastic, fantastic feature.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.220]  I see people posting, and when I see people just posting,
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:28.200]  just typical, not really thinking about it,
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.580]  I've got my camera, I'm just gonna quick shoot a video
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.660]  of this weird thing I just saw.
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:35.300]  Here's a weird thing I saw on the sidewalk.
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.560]  The video looks so much better stabilized.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:42.200]  And well, and on top of that, you think about how iPhones
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.800]  have been used to cover news-breaking events
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.460]  and things like that.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.040]  For someone to be able to pull out a phone at a rally
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.160]  or, God forbid, watching somebody get hurt
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.080]  by another member of society and be able to film that
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.000]  and have that, that footage is now broadcast quality.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.680]  It's 4K, that's pretty impressive.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.520]  The two biggest differences, I think,
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.880]  as consumer cameras have gotten to be so good
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.700]  at high-def video, the two biggest differences
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:10.000]  between professional footage and amateur footage
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.840]  is stabilization and focal length.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.760]  Yeah, lenses.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.920]  And that's still where the plus has the advantage
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.720]  where people, if somebody's shooting a breaking news event
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.460]  but they can't get close for whatever reason,
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:23.360]  they can switch to 2x mode and get
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.120]  a dramatically different picture.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.960]  But when they do that, I don't think,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.220]  there is no OIS on the 2x mode, right?
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.320]  No, there's no OIS on the telephoto,
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.620]  so it's much shakier, both in still photo
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:39.040]  and video, but it is pretty remarkable.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:42.200]  I've been playing around a lot with the zoom,
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.740]  and digital zoom is still digital zoom.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:47.120]  It's not gonna blow the doors down anything
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.520]  when you start shooting at 5 or 10x.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.280]  But the fact remains that you can now shoot
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:57.280]  at 5 and 10x, both in still photographs and video.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:00.200]  And even though the video, again,
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.960]  you're gonna have fuzzy video, very fuzzy video at 10x,
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.400]  but you're gonna have the ability to focus
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.240]  on that tiny thing that you're zoomed into,
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.180]  whereas if you were just shooting at 1x
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.520]  and then tried to blow it up artificially later,
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.800]  you were gonna get a much fuzzy picture.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.680]  And being able to shoot at 10x,
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.840]  I thought this was gonna be complete garbage
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.440]  and I was never gonna use it,
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:26.580]  and I'm still, it's still not great.
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.880]  But for things like we were just talking about,
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.260]  for things like news broadcasts
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:33.400]  or breaking important things,
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.360]  you can get a legible picture at 10x.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.640]  It's not gonna be a great picture.
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:38.460]  It's not gonna be a picture
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:40.240]  that I'd really wanna put on the news,
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:41.640]  but it is a legible picture.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.500]  You can see what's happening.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.640]  Yeah, it's an impressive difference.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.080]  In the same way that before we had the second lens
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.560]  that you could shoot at 2x and you knew it was digital,
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.120]  but, and you couldn't get it exactly
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.140]  because I didn't show you exactly,
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:57.660]  but you know when you pinch that you're,
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:59.560]  you're not really pushing your luck
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.100]  with digital zoom too much.
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.420]  You know, you could get closer to something
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.260]  and it was usable,
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.940]  but now by starting with that telephoto lens,
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:09.700]  it's really amazing.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.540]  Yeah, it is.
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.700]  I should, I guess I should clarify on video,
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.340]  you can only go up to 6x,
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:18.260]  but it's equivalent to the framing of 10x
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:20.220]  because video's pushed in, yeah.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.820]  Cropped sensor, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:22.660]  Yeah.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.380]  So portrait mode.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:26.740]  Portrait mode.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:27.580]  This is the part,
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.540]  this is the part where I'm gonna start crying.
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:33.460]  Well, you, you got to play with it this weekend, right?
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.980]  You were playing with it on your review unit?
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:35.820]  I, yeah.
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.620]  When did I put it on, Friday or Thursday?
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.020]  I think it was last Thursday I did.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.460]  I saw your Flickr photos of Jonas.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.300]  Yeah.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.420]  And some of them turned out great.
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:47.820]  And it's sort of a no-lose situation by default
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.120]  because it shoots, it stores,
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.220]  it shows, you know, by default you get both.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.500]  And so if it does something undesirable with your image
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.780]  by blurring something that probably shouldn't have been
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.020]  blurred or putting like,
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:02.500]  sometimes your heads look like there's a halo around them.
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.860]  It does, the edge detection on hair is sometimes imperfect.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.100]  The worst case scenario is you just delete the one
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:11.760]  with the depth effect and you've still got the no,
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.700]  nothing fancy was applied.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:16.780]  This is just the image you shot with the camera picture.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.580]  And it also, the fact that it does both,
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.220]  really does make it fun to compare if you want to nerd out
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.780]  and try to figure out how the heck they're doing this.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:26.600]  Yep.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:28.180]  And you're like, oh, which is, which is blurred
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.180]  and how much is blurred.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.900]  And it was interesting because I did a ton of tests of this
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.260]  that my first thought as soon as it became live
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.620]  is that the beta was, the developer beta was,
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:38.780]  I think, live on.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:39.620]  Thursday.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.520]  Thursday or Wednesday because the public beta
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.040]  was live on Thursday.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.780]  And so when I downloaded it, my first thought was,
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.540]  well, you know, Apple keeps joking that it's going to
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.220]  compete against it or that it looks, you know,
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:55.240]  at small scale, at least indistinguishable from a DSLR.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.020]  So I'm like, well, let me just take my entry-level DSLR
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.260]  and shoot comparison photos.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.820]  So I shot the same like 12 photos side by side,
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.540]  one with a Canon Rebel XTi with a 40 millimeter
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:12.260]  2.8 portrait lens and one with portrait mode on the 7 Plus.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:15.980]  And you know, it's not, I mean, it's still a DSLR
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:18.540]  and it still has a much better sensor and a much better,
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:22.860]  you know, mine isn't a full frame, it's a cropped frame
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:27.420]  camera, but you know, for comparing a $800 camera
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:32.420]  to a $900 smartphone, the 7 Plus takes photos that are
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:39.220]  in 50 to 60% of cases on this beta, this number,
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:42.780]  you know, beta number one, not even really available
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.860]  for public consumption outside of the public beta program.
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.100]  It takes photos that are up to a certain point
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:53.820]  comparable to the DSLR, which that is a little bit
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:56.700]  mind blowing and it's like, I've taken great photos
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.940]  on an iPhone before and great photos that I've preferred
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:04.940]  to a photo that my Canon shot, but to not necessarily
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:08.140]  show up the Canon in a 40 millimeter portrait,
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.620]  but to play in the same ballpark as that,
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.620]  to like go into a major league baseball game
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:15.220]  and be like, no, I'm not gonna bat 400,
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:17.860]  but I'm still gonna hit some pitches and I'm gonna maybe
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:20.020]  like get a double or a triple every now and again,
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:23.900]  like from a cell phone camera, that blows my mind.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:27.260]  It's a very Phil Schiller feature, because I know
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:31.140]  that Phil is a serious amateur photography enthusiast
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.380]  and he really described it so fairly on stage
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.660]  because he emphasized, he went over backwards
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:39.300]  to emphasize that in no way shape or form does this feature
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:43.980]  on the iPhone pose any threat to digital SLR
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:47.060]  as in terms of genuine image quality.
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:50.100]  Yeah, it's not gonna replace your DSLR.
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:52.340]  But some of the shots that you get with this
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:57.340]  are in this like heretofore uncharted territory
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:03.260]  between what you get with these little tiny lenses
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.420]  and sensors on phones and what you can get with an SLR.
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:11.820]  Like it isn't, side by side, the image quality is not gonna,
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:14.380]  the fake bokeh isn't gonna compare to the real
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:16.860]  shallow depth of field of a nice camera.
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:20.340]  But when you just look at the image, it is,
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.700]  when it works, it's so much better than the image
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:24.820]  you were gonna get without this effect.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:29.300]  Oh yeah, and when it works well, it's incredible.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:31.340]  And it's one of those things where you,
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:34.140]  I hate this phrase, but it's still relevant.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.020]  It's the whole best camera is the camera
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:38.100]  that you have with you idea.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.980]  And it's like the T4i is a wonderful camera
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.820]  and I definitely, like I bring it along
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.140]  when I'm going to things where I want
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:50.740]  my professional photos, like weddings or vacations,
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.900]  things where I really wanna have beautiful memories
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:57.980]  and I want like to be able to shoot some artsy photography.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:01.780]  And with the iPhone 7 Plus, like things I wouldn't
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:04.980]  bring it along to are like events like I went to yesterday
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.220]  where Rick and I went to like a corn maze
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.820]  and like picked out pumpkins.
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.940]  And I'm like, I'm not gonna bring a fancy camera
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.580]  to shoot pumpkins because, I don't know,
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:19.460]  it's not 2006, this is not my life anymore.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.220]  But I shot a whole bunch of stuff on the 7 Plus
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:24.860]  and looking through those photos, I'm like,
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:26.620]  these are not, again, these are not photos
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.660]  that are going to beat the T4i
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.140]  if I had brought the T4i along,
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:34.140]  but I'm not regularly carrying my Rebel.
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:36.780]  My Rebel doesn't fit into my back pocket.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.780]  And for me to be able to get photos
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:42.380]  that are like 75% the quality of the Rebel
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.100]  and photos that I would feel comfortable
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.020]  even because they were in good light,
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:50.220]  blowing up to like a picture frame or something like that,
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.780]  like that's pretty fantastic.
[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:54.700]  That's a really wonderful step forward
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:55.660]  for mobile photography.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:58.620]  The threshold for do I want this heavy camera
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.500]  on a strap around my neck all afternoon
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.420]  is getting higher and higher.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.820]  The bar is getting raised for just how much I care
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:07.860]  about the pictures to do it.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.460]  Yes, exactly.
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:14.060]  How many years are these pictures going to be in rotation?
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.380]  And how big a size am I going to eventually
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:18.580]  want to blow them up?
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:22.900]  I am so curious as to how long it's going to take
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:25.540]  for this dual camera system to trickle down
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:27.700]  to the smaller size.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:31.220]  Like is next year too soon?
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:34.540]  It might be because it's like optical image stabilization
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.580]  took two years.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:39.900]  Yeah, although of course when it came,
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:42.860]  it came for both image and video.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:43.700]  That is true.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.300]  It's like less than two years behind.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:49.020]  It caught up to where they were last year.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:51.340]  Yeah, I think it's really going to depend
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:55.180]  on how the form factor changes, if at all,
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.460]  in the next iPhone.
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:58.740]  Because there are of course rumors
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.340]  of the idea of getting rid of the top
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:01.340]  and the bottom of the bezel
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:06.180]  and making the iPhone a little bit smaller squat wise.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:09.140]  And while that would be awesome
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:12.180]  from a holding a plus model perspective,
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:14.860]  it does mean that you're taking away usable space
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:16.980]  for things like sensors and battery
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.660]  and stuff along those lines.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.260]  So that is going to be a big question.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:23.620]  If they change the form factor,
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:25.060]  are they still going to have enough space
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:28.940]  to add the double lens camera on the 7?
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:32.180]  And if they do, are they going to have enough space
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:35.660]  to add stabilization to the second lens on the plus?
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:39.660]  Because I think that's the no brainer next step feature.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.340]  Or putting in a bigger, the telephoto sensor
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:47.060]  also has a smaller sensor than the wide angle lens.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.220]  And that's also something that's like
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.980]  damaging the photos a little bit, not a ton.
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:54.220]  I think that one though is a factor of like,
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:56.940]  if you do the sideways drawing of the lens optics,
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.780]  it's-
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:58.940]  Yeah, it's impossible.
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.740]  Yeah, I think it's actually impossible
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.900]  unless they made the bump stick out further.
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:04.100]  That there's sort of like a max,
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.140]  like the sensor size is determined by,
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:07.860]  okay, if we make the lens,
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.140]  this is how big the lens will be circumference.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.660]  This is how thick the lens,
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:15.580]  how far out we're going to allow it to protrude on the bump.
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.980]  Then you just draw these lines
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:19.340]  and then that defines how big the sensor is.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:22.540]  So I think that the consternation that people had
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:26.780]  about the sensor size of the telephoto thing was misplaced
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.140]  because there's nothing that can be done about that.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.620]  Yeah, it's physics.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:31.460]  There's really, unfortunately-
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.100]  In the same way that if they put a wider angle lens,
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:36.820]  like a fisheye lens, you could get an even bigger sensor
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.420]  because it would, you know-
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:40.580]  Mm-hmm, because of the optics.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:41.420]  Right.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:44.020]  Oh, I asked that would be a huge win.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:44.860]  Yeah.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:48.900]  Why do you think that portrait mode is in beta?
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:52.060]  It's better than I thought.
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:54.580]  I thought it was going to be like crashy.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:57.940]  Not, it seems to me like the only problems it has
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:00.500]  is that it's still sometimes, you know,
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.940]  fuzzes out the side of your head or something like that.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:04.260]  Yeah, it's data.
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:08.500]  I mean, here's my curiosity and my question
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:12.500]  is I wonder if they're using differential privacy
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:17.980]  in the beta to gather anonymous information
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:20.780]  about these photos to better figure out.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:21.980]  I don't know how they would, though.
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:22.820]  I don't know how they would-
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:23.660]  Yeah, I don't think so
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.140]  because I didn't have to opt into anything privacy-wise.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.380]  No, you didn't.
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.820]  It seems like it's all just right there.
[01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:30.660]  You just had to opt in to say, I agree that this is a beta.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:33.300]  Yeah, but I'm not sure if that's in the beta,
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:36.020]  because that's the thing I would think
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:39.860]  is that you use it as a beta so that you can have people,
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:41.980]  you can not only have data to figure out
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.700]  how to make your detection better,
[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:46.460]  but you can also have people give feedback
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.700]  and say like, yo, this picture is great
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.860]  except it blurred out half of my hair
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:53.620]  and this picture of an object is great
[01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.820]  except, you know, half of the object is out of focus.
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:59.300]  And granted, you know, object detection
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.860]  is not officially supported in any way, shape, or form.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.060]  If you go by the official Apple line,
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:06.820]  the only thing you should use portrait mode for is portraits.
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:10.260]  But of course, people like taking close-up pictures
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:12.860]  of their pets and objects and things like that.
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:16.220]  I saw a great photo of a pair of boots today
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.060]  that kind of blew me away.
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:19.060]  I'm looking at that on your Twitter account as we speak.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:21.140]  And it is a perfect example of a photo
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:26.140]  where I wouldn't want, I'm not enough of a photo nerd
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:27.980]  and without zooming in,
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:29.980]  just looking at it at the natural size,
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.140]  if you wanted to Pepsi challenge me like,
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.060]  okay, was this shot with portrait mode
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:37.620]  or was it shot with a $2,000 Canon SLR
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.340]  and a 50 millimeter prime lens?
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.020]  I would not want to answer the question
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:43.300]  because I can't tell.
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:44.740]  You can only really tell blowing it up
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:48.700]  to full screen resolution on my 5K iMac.
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:52.420]  Right, and that's sort of one of the reasons
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:56.500]  that I think that this feature is going to be so popular
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:58.820]  and it's so useful is that so much of the time
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:03.140]  we spend looking at photos is on iPhones
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.340]  or other phone size screens.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:09.140]  And the difference between the fake depth effect
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:11.380]  and the real optical depth effect of a better camera,
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:14.340]  it's way harder, the smaller you make the picture,
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.140]  the harder it is to tell the difference.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.780]  Absolutely, and they're doing,
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:20.660]  Apple is doing a really smart thing here
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:24.420]  in terms of the levels of detection they're using,
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:27.100]  the depth map that they're making,
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:30.260]  where I feel like, there have been Android phones
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:33.300]  that have attempted to do a feature like this right now,
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:37.420]  before, and actually our friend of AIMOR
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.180]  and our Canadian editor, Daniel Bader,
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:42.020]  did a comparison between the Honor 8 camera
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:45.340]  and the iPhone because they both have dual lens systems
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:47.460]  and a fake bokeh kind of effect.
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:51.180]  But the difference, the main difference
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.100]  is that not only is Apple using this
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:58.100]  in a pseudo telephoto portrait style lens,
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:02.180]  but they're blurring, the blurs are soft,
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:04.980]  when it works well, the blurs are soft, gradual,
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:08.360]  and intentional so that in the very far back of the picture,
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.960]  you've got it at sort of max Gaussian blur.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.460]  But if you get to like the second depth,
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:15.740]  so like the leaves, like I'm looking
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.040]  at one of the corn pictures that I did,
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.400]  the leaves right behind my head are only slightly blurred
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.060]  when you compare that to the blur
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.800]  at the very back of the cornfield,
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.460]  which is much more blurred and almost to the effect,
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:29.940]  almost to the extent where you'd get
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:34.940]  kind of the quote unquote bokeh style light aberrations,
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:39.700]  whereas stuff like the Honor 8 just does a flat blur
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:42.460]  and doesn't really try and make a super depth map of it.
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:44.300]  Or maybe it tries to make a depth map,
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.420]  but it just fails utterly and just ends up
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:49.780]  just doing a mass like, here is the subject
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:51.460]  cut out of the picture, and then here is
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:52.820]  just straight Gaussian blur.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:55.820]  And that was my fear when portrait mode launched,
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.060]  is that it was, or when it launched, when it was announced,
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.760]  was that it was going to just be that,
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:02.900]  where it was just going to be straight Gaussian blur
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.180]  and then subject cut out.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.260]  And they've really done something
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:07.260]  much more refined with this.
[02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:09.460]  I guessed very wrong about how it was gonna work.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.680]  My initial guess coming out of day one of the Apple event,
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:14.680]  based on what they said, was my guess was
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:17.780]  what they were gonna do is use the two cameras
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:21.820]  to create the depth map and use that to set focus point,
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.240]  the focus point on the telephoto lens,
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.900]  which would take the main image,
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:28.700]  but that they would then take a second image
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:31.780]  with the wide angle, or yeah, with the wide angle camera,
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:34.780]  but at a focal length of like one inch
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:38.320]  so that it would blur everything, everything would be blurry
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.580]  and then they would crop that, you know,
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:42.620]  something like that, so that you'd get
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:44.720]  actual optical blur from the,
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.940]  but that's not how they're doing it at all.
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:48.580]  That is not, and...
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.420]  But it might be in the future.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.700]  I don't know, but it's this,
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.820]  the reason my mind went that way
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:56.140]  is I thought it would look better,
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.060]  but this looks so much better than I thought it would
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:01.140]  based on the fact that it's all in software
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:05.060]  from a, you know, with all the imagery
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:07.020]  coming from the one lens.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:10.080]  Oh yeah, there's, I mean, some of these images I look at
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.260]  and like this, the ISP was able to give this to me
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:17.260]  in under a second, like this didn't take
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.980]  five minutes of rendering to put together.
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:21.500]  And it's, you know, they're doing it live.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.860]  I mean, it's so fast that the preview is live,
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:26.480]  but I do, I wonder if that is one of the reasons
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.340]  they're calling it beta, because the frame rate
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.220]  on the live preview, it's, I don't know,
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:33.020]  I'm complaining about this thing that a couple of years ago
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.940]  would have taken like 30 seconds to render in Photoshop.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.180]  You know, you'd have like a progress bar
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:40.820]  showing you how close it is.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.680]  And now I'm getting it as a live preview
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.380]  and I'm complaining about how slow it is
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.820]  because the frame rate looks to me
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:49.380]  like it's somewhere in the 20s.
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:52.740]  It's clearly under 30 frames per second though.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:56.240]  Yeah, it's definitely, I would say looking at it
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.860]  side to side, it's probably 24.
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:04.180]  But maybe it's not even, it's not stat, you know,
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.560]  maybe it varies given the complexity of the picture.
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.340]  And I've definitely seen it stutter
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:13.740]  when it's trying to figure out more complex depth maps.
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:16.940]  Even in times when the actual picture
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:18.260]  ends up coming out really well,
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.020]  like a picture of pumpkins I took,
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:22.940]  the original depth map that it was previewing for me
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:25.460]  had like half of the pumpkins blurred.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.260]  And I've learned kind of to trust
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.100]  that the ISP knows what it's doing
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.740]  and even if the preview isn't correct,
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:32.640]  it's probably gonna look better.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.380]  It really must have killed the product team
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:39.380]  that wasn't able to ship in the first version
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:43.140]  just because all of our initial reviews didn't,
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:43.980]  all we ever met.
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:44.800]  Didn't include it, yeah.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.380]  All we could mention about portrait mode
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.180]  is that this is a feature that's coming in
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:50.980]  and it's software update.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:54.060]  But it is super compelling in my opinion.
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:56.580]  Better to get it right than to ship it early
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.660]  and have it be not great.
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:00.500]  And it's like, it's not bad right now.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.340]  It's very promising for beta one.
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:06.300]  But I'm glad that they're starting it as a beta
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.060]  rather than shipping it unfinished
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:11.980]  or shipping it kind of with half hazard edge detection.
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:14.600]  I just don't know how they're gathering data to fix it
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.220]  while it's in the beta.
[02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:17.180]  I don't know either.
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:18.780]  And I have definitely noticed
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:20.860]  and I don't know how much this is factoring
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:22.420]  into the beta description.
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:24.460]  Like you said, it definitely wants you
[02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.200]  to take a picture of a person
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.740]  because it's doing this facial recognition
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:31.420]  to get the focus point in the depth map.
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:34.940]  And when I've tried to use it to shoot inanimate objects,
[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:37.100]  the results are, it's harder.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:40.480]  It often refuses to even engage depth mode.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.060]  And then even when it does,
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:45.300]  it's all messed, sometimes all messed up
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:47.180]  in terms of what it chooses to blur.
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:50.360]  Have you manually, have you used the manual focus point?
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:52.900]  By tapping the screen?
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:54.060]  Yeah.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.380]  Yeah, but it doesn't, it doesn't work.
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:58.140]  Sometimes it doesn't help.
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:00.820]  So for some reason, it'll focus on that point.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:02.300]  It's not that it doesn't focus,
[02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.740]  but it isn't able to do the depth map.
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.060]  To do the, yeah, to do the blur properly.
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:11.280]  So for, you know, probably most people listening
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:14.700]  either don't already have a seven plus in their hands.
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.640]  And even if they do, they may not be foolish enough
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.620]  to be running a developer beta on it.
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:20.380]  So by the time most people listen to this,
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:23.020]  they, you know, they won't have used it firsthand.
[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:28.020]  The thing is, it's very much like the HDR indicator.
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:31.140]  So when you're, you know, before you even snap the photo,
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:34.860]  if you have HDR on, it'll, the HDR indicator
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:36.940]  turns bright yellow, so you know you're getting
[02:06:36.940 --> 02:06:40.380]  an HDR is on, like if you have HDR set to auto.
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:42.680]  So when you're shooting in portrait mode,
[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:47.420]  you know whether it sees, whether it's going to shoot
[02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:50.040]  with the mode or not, because it actually turns yellow
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.580]  with a yellow background and says depth effect.
[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:54.460]  And if it does, if you don't see that,
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:55.340]  you're not going to get,
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.980]  you're definitely not gonna get the depth effect.
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:02.100]  So you don't even have to judge it based on the live preview
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:05.100]  to see if you see the fuzzy background or whatever.
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.540]  If you don't see that yellow indicator of depth effect,
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:10.020]  it doesn't, it's confused by what it's,
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:12.100]  what's in the frame and hasn't yet done it.
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:13.420]  And with inanimate objects,
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:16.820]  it definitely can take a lot longer than with humans.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:19.680]  With humans, with humans, you really can just sorta
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:22.080]  put it in that mode, frame it, shoot,
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.300]  and trust that it's gonna use depth effect.
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.140]  Yeah.
[02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:26.140]  It's not too bad with pets.
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:27.940]  It works pretty quickly.
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:28.940]  That's my question.
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:32.220]  My question was, because of the vague similarities,
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.060]  you know, eyes and a round head,
[02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:37.460]  does it seem to do better with pets than say,
[02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:39.500]  you know, bottles or shoes?
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.340]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.820]  It has a lot of problems
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.020]  with anything that's semi-reflective.
[02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:47.980]  So iPhones, it doesn't have a huge success rate
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:51.000]  with right now, especially jet black iPhones.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.820]  Or I tried to take a picture of a whiskey bottle
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:55.940]  that I put in my DSLR comparison,
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:58.780]  and it was like half blur and half whiskey bottle,
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.880]  and then the label was blurred out.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.060]  So it has problems with writing,
[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:04.180]  and it has problems with reflection.
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:08.060]  But pets seem to, it seems to treat pets pretty well.
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:11.220]  I've gotten some really, really spectacular pictures
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:15.180]  of my dogs with this mode engaged.
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:17.560]  And even, I was taking pictures today
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:20.940]  out on a walk with one of the dogs.
[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:24.460]  So this was motion portrait mode.
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:28.060]  And even while my dog was moving,
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:30.780]  it managed to get a pretty good picture.
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:32.560]  I've only, granted, I've only looked at it
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.140]  on the preview in photos,
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.140]  so I could go back and look at it now,
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:37.120]  and it could be awful.
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:40.920]  But to my recollection, it actually looked pretty great.
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.660]  Yeah, I shot a whiskey bottle, actually, for a friend,
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:49.820]  because it was somebody who was looking for a recommendation
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:53.860]  and it came out amazing, I think.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.740]  Here, I'll send it to you now.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.820]  Let's hope I'm sending it to the right person.
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.220]  Nope, that's my dad.
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:02.660]  Close enough.
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:04.740]  No, but it was definitely,
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:07.180]  but it definitely took some time to,
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:08.840]  with the playing with manual focus,
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:12.640]  to get the depth effect indicator to come on.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:16.040]  Yeah, you have to take a little while,
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.260]  and then even when the depth effect indicator comes on,
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:19.600]  it may not always work.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:24.600]  I feel like with objects, and with non-human subjects,
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:28.040]  there's one of two things that happens.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:31.280]  It's either it blurs out too much stuff,
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:35.400]  and it goes too much into the actual object,
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:40.400]  or it creates this very fine cut around the subject.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:45.160]  And if you zoom in, you can see maybe a millimeter,
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:50.160]  half a millimeter of fuzz of the pre-blurred background.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:56.680]  But when you're looking at it just on an iPhone screen,
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:57.880]  you can't really tell.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.720]  Yeah.
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:03.600]  I also, and this whiskey bottle shot that I sent you
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:06.360]  is one more example of it to me,
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  where it seems to me like, and again,
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.360]  maybe I'm getting a placebo effect here
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.040]  because I'm seeing what I wanna see,
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.720]  but I think so far, and this is something I've only noticed
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:22.160]  after I wrote my initial review,
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.280]  but it seems to me like the noise you get
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:29.160]  from the iPhone 7 cameras is a more pleasant noise.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:31.160]  Oh, especially on the telephoto.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.760]  Yeah, and this whiskey bottle shot I sent you to me,
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.880]  and it's sort of, I used to have this camera
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.720]  from years ago.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.800]  I used it so much that it actually,
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.840]  I used it until it wore out and it broke.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:46.840]  The digital camera just, it just doesn't work right anymore.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:48.640]  It was called a Rico, it was from Rico.
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.140]  It was a Rico GRD.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:53.560]  And Rico is sort of an obscure,
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.000]  everybody knows him as like a photocopier company.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.360]  They don't have a big presence in North America.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:59.920]  And when I bought the Rico GRD,
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:02.080]  I think it was like 2006 or so,
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:03.780]  it was like a point and shoot
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:08.780]  with a fixed 28 millimeter f1.8 lens,
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.080]  or maybe it was a 2.0 lens,
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:11.440]  but a very, very fast lens for,
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.760]  especially for 2005, 2006 point and shoot.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:17.360]  And I had to buy it on the gray market
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:20.640]  because they didn't actually sell it in North America.
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:23.000]  But it was my, it was probably one of my favorite,
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.400]  probably my very favorite camera camera
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:26.360]  that I've ever owned in my life.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.120]  In fact, I wouldn't hesitate as just as a camera.
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.800]  I took more great photos with that camera
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.160]  because it was small.
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.640]  But one of the things Rico, and it made me buy it,
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.560]  was that Rico had this reputation
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.140]  that their digital image processing
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:47.380]  created more film-like noise, right?
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:50.680]  Noises with small digital cameras, noise is inevitable.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.000]  There's no way to get around it.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.360]  The combination of the size of the sensor
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.800]  and the size of the lens, you're gonna have noise.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.040]  But some of the shots I shot over the years with the Rico
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.240]  really, to me, looked like vivid film prints,
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:07.280]  but like, you know, ISO 400 or ISO 800 film prints,
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.260]  where, you know, there's definite film grain.
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:14.000]  But it's just pleasant to look at.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.640]  I think the iPhone 7 cameras have that sort of effect
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:20.360]  that they've, and I think it's to their credit,
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.000]  where maybe, I think, if we wanted to knock
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.120]  the iPhone 6 and 6S cameras,
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.400]  that maybe they went too far trying to reduce noise,
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.960]  you know, and that the noise reduction,
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.600]  the bad effects of noise reduction
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:33.520]  were a little bit too visible.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:35.880]  They try and smooth it a lot, and that's something,
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:38.380]  I mean, I see that, I'm sending you a couple pictures,
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.880]  trading, of a couple of low-light pictures, especially.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:46.240]  I'm still seeing that sort of smoothing process happening
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:51.240]  on the wide-angle lens and on sort of brighter,
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.640]  brighter facial tones when you're shooting indoors,
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:58.080]  but these dark shadows, I think,
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:01.680]  the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus cameras are doing so much better on,
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:05.220]  whereas prior, you kind of got just either like a flat,
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:10.220]  like very, very variegated blur on people's faces.
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:12.840]  I can't describe the smoothing exactly,
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.480]  but it feels very digital.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.360]  It feels very, not tacky as in a bad thing,
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.160]  but tacky as in almost sticky, almost in a weird.
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.440]  This picture you sent me of Rick is a great example.
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:25.520]  Nobody's gonna call this your best picture of Rick,
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:30.120]  but it has a character to it
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:31.080]  that you just never would have thought
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.320]  came from a phone camera.
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:35.960]  Exactly, the soft blur on that is beautiful.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:38.760]  And you end up with, yeah, and I'm looking at the noise,
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:40.800]  it's in your, is it your kitchen?
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:41.640]  I don't know, but there's.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:42.460]  Yeah, that's my kitchen.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:43.300]  It's obviously at night,
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:45.300]  and there's dark shadows underneath the cabinets,
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:48.240]  and there's not really noise underneath them.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.720]  It's really, really effective.
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:52.760]  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to,
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:56.360]  especially one of the sort of downsides
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:59.380]  to the telephoto lens is, of course,
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:00.920]  because it doesn't have OIS,
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.040]  and because it's a 2.8 aperture,
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.640]  on the normal photo mode,
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:09.520]  if you try and shoot in a low-light situation,
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:12.320]  it automatically defaults to the wide-angle lens,
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  zoomed in at 2x, but it doesn't do that with portrait mode.
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.020]  So you can actually use portrait mode,
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:20.100]  even if you're not using the depth effect,
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.360]  to shoot low-light portraits with that telephoto lens.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.480]  And I really do think that the telephoto
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:27.720]  has a much nicer grain,
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.340]  maybe because of the fact that the aperture
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:32.560]  is a little bit higher,
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.700]  and the light received to that sensor
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.680]  is a little bit different.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.720]  But it really does produce these really beautiful,
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:40.840]  maybe it's just the framing,
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.960]  but it produces these really beautiful,
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.720]  almost film-like images, and I like that.
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.960]  I love that texture.
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.720]  Yeah, and some people would complain,
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:52.520]  like one of my Rico nerdery,
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.200]  the counterargument was,
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.440]  you shouldn't be trying to simulate film,
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.280]  be pure to digital.
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:14:59.680]  And I think that's nonsense.
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:01.000]  I think you should be trying,
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:01.840]  that the engineers-
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.000]  You want a good image.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.800]  Right, the engineers should be optimizing for pleasantness,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.640]  and whether that means simulating film or not,
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:09.720]  it doesn't matter.
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:13.320]  Does this look, is this more pleasing to your eye?
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.760]  And if the answer's yes, then do it,
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:18.320]  whether it's legitimately digital or fake analog,
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:19.160]  don't worry about it.
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:20.280]  Exactly. Don't overthink it.
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.520]  Looking at that whiskey bottle you sent me,
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.920]  like the, yes, the blur is artificial,
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.120]  and the blur is Gaussian,
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:28.140]  and I know a lot of people are throwing their hands up
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:28.980]  and just being like,
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:31.200]  well, it doesn't look like an optical blur,
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.480]  it looks so fake.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.900]  I'm like, yeah, but the picture of the whiskey bottle
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:39.360]  with the artificial blur looks about 100 times better
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.960]  than the whiskey bottle without the artificial blur.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:43.760]  It's actually not a Gaussian blur.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:45.760]  I don't know if you saw this.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:48.000]  Matthew Panzareno, friend of the show,
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.920]  frequent guest, he got the scoop on this.
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:56.280]  He got two days pre-release access to the beta software,
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:59.920]  and had a really great article at TechCrunch on this thing.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.040]  And he had written that it was a Gaussian blur,
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:04.920]  because somebody at Apple, in product marketing,
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.960]  that's what they told him.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:06.800]  That's what they told him.
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:09.960]  But then somebody who worked on the code was like,
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:10.800]  oh, no, no.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:12.120]  And then it was like this whole hassle
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:13.880]  of somewhere within Apple,
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:17.280]  somebody who had worked on the code wanted it to be known
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.840]  that no, we're not just doing a Gaussian blur.
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:20.680]  I forget the term,
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.760]  but it's like they've created their own custom disc blur.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:27.100]  Okay, well, so I got my information
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:30.400]  from Matt's original review, so now that's very interesting.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.720]  I can believe that, yeah.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.620]  If you reload it, he's got an update at that section.
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:36.920]  But it does make some amount of sense
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:38.480]  that it's a disc blur,
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:40.960]  because that's sort of the bokeh effect.
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:45.960]  Yeah, well, it gets you closer to that lighting effect
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:49.960]  that people associate with the sort of bokeh look.
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:55.040]  One of the few things I do know about photography
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.040]  is that the effect of actual bokeh,
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:03.040]  it matters what shape the iris,
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.360]  what's the iris of the camera called?
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:09.260]  In terms of the lens?
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:11.720]  The thing that opens in front of the lens,
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:13.720]  the little disc thing that opens in a circular fashion.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:15.000]  The shutter?
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.480]  Yeah, the shutter, the shape of the shutter.
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:20.120]  Oh, it depends on how it renders, okay.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.120]  Yeah, and a less expensive camera
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:25.280]  will have fewer parts to the shutter
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:26.680]  because it's cheaper, right?
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.400]  It's cheaper to make a five-sided thing,
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:30.480]  whereas a more expensive camera has more parts,
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.620]  and so therefore it's closer to a sphere as it opens.
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.460]  Interesting.
[02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:37.520]  And so a more expensive,
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:40.520]  so just looking at Canon's 50-millimeter lenses,
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:43.840]  you get better bokeh out of the more expensive ones.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:45.960]  One of the reasons why is the glass is better,
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:48.680]  but number two, because the shutter has more elements,
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.160]  it actually creates more of a spherical bokeh effect.
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.600]  That makes a lot of sense.
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:56.960]  So it makes sense to me that their blur is a disc blur.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.240]  Yeah, to try and emulate.
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:01.600]  Well, and also the pictures that I just sent you
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.240]  are from my DSLR comparison,
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:05.840]  and the top one is the iPhone 7 Plus,
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:09.480]  and the bottom is the Canon XTi,
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.600]  and you can definitely see the difference
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:15.500]  in sort of that lighting effect between subject
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:18.620]  and then the light coming through the trees
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.480]  in terms of how that lens operates.
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:22.240]  So that is something I didn't know
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:24.360]  about the shape of the shutter and how much,
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:25.920]  and that actually makes a ton of sense
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:28.340]  because you're dealing with a much smaller,
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:32.840]  by nature, kind of has to be less complex camera
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.480]  because there's really only so much space
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:36.080]  you can fit inside there.
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.640]  And so concludes the half hour segment of the talk show
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  where I talk about the camera.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.060]  I won't have it in my pocket for the next year.
[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:46.900]  It's okay.
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:49.800]  Just remember, I mean, it's about the price of a DSLR,
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.040]  so you could always buy an iPhone just to shoot with it.
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:54.860]  Yeah.
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:57.920]  I will say, just as a final point of the show,
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:01.440]  that I spent almost a full two weeks with the Plus
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.600]  as my sole camera, practically speaking,
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:09.600]  and loved the camera, especially loved the portrait mode
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:12.600]  and hated everything else.
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:13.440]  Everything else.
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:14.280]  Everything else.
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.680]  I really just disliked the size.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.200]  I used my phone too much one-handed to use the Plus.
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:25.600]  And so I'm convinced that my love
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:27.560]  for the dual camera system aside,
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:30.920]  it still doesn't outweigh the benefits to me,
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:34.240]  just the hand feel and pocket feel of the smaller one.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:35.080]  Yeah.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.480]  The large one for me is definitely a trade-off
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.400]  for the camera, and it pains my soul
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.720]  because I really love the jet black iPhone 7.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:45.960]  It is so comfortable.
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:47.860]  It's the reason why there's a Sena case on that one
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:50.240]  and not on the Plus yet.
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.800]  I realize, and I do realize,
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.160]  so my advice to people, though,
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.400]  is if you can vaguely tolerate,
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.140]  even just, yeah, I don't really love it,
[02:19:57.140 --> 02:19:59.020]  but I can tolerate the Plus, get the Plus,
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:00.560]  because it is amazing.
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.800]  And for the first time, like in previous years,
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.660]  I definitely reviewed the Plus,
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:07.280]  and I spent a couple days with it,
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:09.920]  but it was so clear to me that I didn't want it,
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:11.060]  that I spent most of my time
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:12.840]  with the one I figured I'd use,
[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:13.840]  whereas this was the first year
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:16.120]  where I spent like two solid weeks living with it
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.400]  as my day-to-day phone.
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:19.640]  And the battery life difference really,
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:21.120]  really, it's almost- Oh, it's shocking.
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:22.080]  It's almost comical.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:22.960]  Like, there was one night
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:25.280]  where I literally forgot to charge my phone overnight
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:28.360]  because I was so back and forth between two phones,
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:30.640]  and I just left it downstairs,
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.560]  and it still had 44% battery life.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.960]  It was like- Yeah, what's your iPhone 7 battery
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:37.340]  at right now?
[02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:38.680]  I don't have the percentage on,
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:41.040]  and I actually was plugging it in while we recorded, so.
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:42.200]  Oh, okay.
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.480]  Well, then nevermind.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:46.880]  Last night, though, it got down to the red
[02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:47.720]  before I went to the red.
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:49.720]  Yeah, I mean, the iPhone 7's battery
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:51.920]  is certainly much better than the 6S,
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:55.600]  so even if you're upgrading from 4.7-inch to 4.7-inch,
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.520]  you're gonna see a good upgrade.
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:00.240]  But oh, man, the Plus's battery life,
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:03.440]  I mean, when I switched back to the 6S
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:06.120]  from the 6S Plus last year,
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:10.200]  I pretty much had an Apple battery case on that thing
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.640]  pretty much constantly
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:14.280]  since after the Apple battery case was released,
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:15.780]  because I'm just like, well, this is easy,
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.280]  because it has the lightning connector,
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:19.560]  so I can plug it into all my lightning things,
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:22.360]  and it basically gives me the battery life of the Plus.
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.600]  But now I get to have the battery life
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:27.160]  of that kind of an iPhone,
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:28.720]  but I get to carry it without a case,
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:31.040]  and I get to enjoy the jet black finish.
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:34.760]  And that probably would not happen if I had an iPhone 7.
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:37.560]  I'd probably just put it back in the battery case.
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:40.960]  I like my battery.
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:47.500]  The battery life on the iPhone 7 is fine,
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:49.880]  and it does seem, if anything, a little bit better,
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.240]  I think, in real life than the 6S for me,
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:54.080]  but it's nothing compared to the Plus.
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:57.360]  The Plus is like, it really is like having a battery case
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:58.520]  on your phone.
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:00.800]  And I'm not saying anything everybody doesn't know
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:03.280]  or that the advertised specs don't indicate,
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.000]  but it's like, you could just use the hell out of it
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.900]  and not even worry about a charge.
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.440]  So anyway, that's my take.
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:13.600]  Anything else you wanted to cover before we wrap things up?
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:17.480]  Oh gosh, I feel like we could talk Apple Watch,
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.840]  but there's so much.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:22.160]  Yeah, I don't have a lot to say about it,
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:25.840]  because it's not that different from, as you call it,
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:28.520]  I love the Series 0.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.340]  I love it.
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:32.200]  But it's, you know, a Series 0 that's updated
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:37.200]  to watchOS 3 is, you know, it's got almost everything.
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:39.920]  The brighter screen, though, is enough for me,
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:42.000]  because it really is the difference
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.080]  between being unreadable and, yeah,
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.820]  I can read it in bright sunlight.
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:48.120]  Yeah, the brighter screen is pretty nice,
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.120]  although it's especially nice for me,
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.720]  because, and this is kind of my big thing,
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:55.680]  is that I had a 38 millimeter Series 0,
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.880]  and I don't know how many people who listened to your show
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.680]  struggled with the 38 millimeter
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.520]  all for the last, you know, 17, 18 months,
[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:08.620]  but the 38 millimeter has abhorrent battery life.
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:12.540]  I mean, it was made with pretty much the bare minimum,
[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:15.860]  you know, the bare minimum acceptability standards,
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:17.940]  I think, because I would use that,
[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:21.640]  I would use that watch, you know, one two-hour workout,
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.820]  and that watch would be down to, like, 40%,
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:26.760]  and it would die around six, seven p.m. for me.
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:29.040]  And I would, you know, like, I figured out ways
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:31.860]  to make it work, where I would, like, charge it
[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:34.100]  while I was showering, and thankfully,
[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:37.080]  like, quick charge would work, but it was such a pain.
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:39.360]  Yeah, especially it's- And so frustrating.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:41.560]  I think if you didn't use workout, maybe not,
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:44.480]  but anybody who used the workout feature, I've heard that.
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:46.160]  I mean, it's same thing with Amy.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.140]  Joanna Stern was on the show a while back,
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:50.680]  and, you know, it was a big part of her review,
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:53.680]  where 38 millimeters combined with workout was,
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:55.940]  you actually kind of need to figure out a way
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:58.720]  to sneak a charge in during the day.
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.760]  Yeah, which is really unfortunate.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:01.600]  And is that better?
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.780]  Is that better with series two?
[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:04.620]  Night and day.
[02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:07.920]  It's actually incredible, because one of my big fears
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:10.740]  when they announced, you know, they were talking series two,
[02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:12.520]  and they mentioned nothing about the battery,
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:16.780]  but they did say GPS, and they said brighter screen,
[02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:18.960]  and they said faster processor.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.680]  And those three things to me said, oh great,
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.980]  the series two 38 millimeter is going to have the same,
[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:26.860]  if not worse, battery life,
[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:29.400]  and I'm gonna be really unhappy.
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:32.780]  And then, you know, I talked to an Apple spokesperson
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.620]  at the event, and they're like,
[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:35.560]  actually, there is a slightly bigger battery
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.880]  in the 38 millimeter, we're just not advertising it.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.560]  And actual use case has been incredible.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:47.480]  Like to the fact where I was doing a two hour workouts,
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:50.200]  like I would do a 30 minute workout in the morning
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:53.080]  just doing an outdoor walk with my dogs.
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:54.800]  And then I would go, you know,
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:56.880]  I would use it throughout the day, I would use Siri,
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.200]  I would use directions, I would even pull up Offy
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:02.580]  a couple of times to like do my two factor authentication.
[02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:04.800]  I had my screen on the brightest setting.
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:07.600]  And then I'd go and play roller derby for two hours.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:10.960]  And I'd come back and take a shower with the thing on
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:13.160]  and look, and my battery was still 20%
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:14.120]  at the end of the day.
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.160]  And that, like that has never happened to me
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.320]  in the history of Apple Watch.
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.960]  And especially it was extremely noticeable.
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.480]  I wore three watches on my wrists for about 48 hours straight
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:29.000]  where I had a series two, a series one, and a series zero,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.400]  just to test all the same things.
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.040]  Did you go out in public like that?
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:34.700]  I did, but I had long sleeves.
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:38.260]  The only time people actually saw it
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:39.380]  was when I was playing derby.
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:42.340]  And I got a little bit of grief there, a little bit of shit.
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:46.460]  You look like such, you're actually doing actual work
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:47.740]  that is practically, you know,
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:49.300]  has practical effects for your readers,
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.140]  but you just look like such a jerk.
[02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:52.140]  Oh, I look ridiculous.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:53.780]  I look like a jackass, yeah.
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:56.900]  So I tried to like hide it as much as possible,
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:59.900]  but I did like, I got some valuable information
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:01.540]  on 38 millimeter battery tests.
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:03.420]  And that's, I don't know.
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:05.380]  I mean, maybe it's entirely possible.
[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:07.460]  Did I miss it or did you not publish your work?
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:09.420]  That's tomorrow, it's coming tomorrow, yeah.
[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:11.340]  Thank goodness, because that would have been terrible.
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:14.040]  All right, well, the show will probably come out tomorrow.
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:15.300]  So we will. There we go.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:17.140]  Yeah, I'll send you the link.
[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:18.740]  Try to get it in the show notes.
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:22.740]  That is good to hear though.
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:24.020]  And I feel like that's very practical.
[02:26:24.020 --> 02:26:27.940]  I think one thing too, is if I hear faster CPU
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:30.020]  and I'm still thinking like in the old days
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:31.860]  where, well, the faster the CPU,
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:33.620]  the more power it's gonna consume.
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:36.140]  Whereas I think, especially on a wearable,
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:37.780]  it's actually the opposite where-
[02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:39.380]  Yeah, more efficiency.
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:42.180]  Right, because you're looking at the screen less
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:44.020]  because you're not waiting as long.
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:46.900]  And it's the screen that's burning way more power
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:48.300]  than the CPU.
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.020]  So if you can raise your wrist,
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:53.140]  see what you wanna see and lower your wrist,
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.460]  it's actually a win on battery life.
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:59.660]  Oh yeah, I never used raise to wake for series zero
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:02.740]  because I thought it was gonna just kill my battery life
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:05.940]  because I do enough gesticulating with my hands
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:08.140]  that to have the screen randomly turn on and off,
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:09.980]  I'm like, that's just gonna drain my battery.
[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:12.380]  And I kept it on the lowest brightness setting
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:15.620]  for an entire, I don't know, 16, 17 months.
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:18.300]  Because when it was on its brightest battery setting
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:21.340]  and raise to wake, I couldn't get past 3 p.m.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:22.800]  with the watch.
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:26.500]  So to be able to actually use the brightest battery setting
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:29.900]  or brightest setting, I'm looking at my watch right now.
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:33.940]  It's at 60% at 5.40 p.m. Eastern time
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:38.020]  after having gone on an hour and 30 minute walk
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:41.780]  with GPS enabled on a 38 millimeter watch.
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.140]  94%, but I haven't done that.
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:45.940]  I did not leave the house today.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:47.500]  You're like, I've done nothing.
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.060]  Yeah, battery life, the brighter screen
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.020]  is a huge win for me.
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:54.420]  I would look forward to your review,
[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:56.460]  but I just don't have much more to say than
[02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:57.300]  what I've already written.
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:00.220]  It's way more about the OS than the watch.
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:02.500]  Even though I have those good things to say
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:03.560]  about the new watch hardware,
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.420]  it's clearly way more about the software.
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:09.760]  Yeah, watchOS 3 basically redirected the Apple Watch
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.620]  to a much smarter place.
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:15.040]  And I don't think the Series 0 is garbage anymore.
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.960]  It's still quite usable, especially with watchOS 3.
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:22.280]  It's just, if you're a 38 millimeter user,
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.220]  the Series 2 is the magic salve
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:28.280]  that you've been looking for for your Apple Watch.
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:29.860]  It just makes it usable.
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:31.580]  Yeah, well, that's good to hear.
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:32.640]  I will put a link to that in.
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.860]  Everybody can get all the serenity
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:38.700]  called what they want on Twitter.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:41.800]  Her username is settern, S-E-T-T-E-R-N,
[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:45.300]  and all of her work at iMore.
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:47.060]  Anything else you wanted to give a shout out to
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:48.860]  before we pull the plug?
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:51.860]  Oh gosh, other than the Apple Watch review,
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:52.980]  not too much.
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:54.180]  Thank you for having me, John.
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.220]  This has been fun, as always.
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:57.060]  Always good to have you.
[02:28:57.060 --> 02:28:59.140]  I wanted somebody who I knew has used all this new stuff.
[02:28:59.140 --> 02:29:00.060]  How about the AirPods?
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:00.900]  We haven't talked about them.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:02.340]  Did you guys get review units?
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:05.900]  Yeah, so Rene officially got the AirPods,
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:07.580]  so I only got to play with them in New York,
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:10.340]  and he's been playing with them for the last two weeks.
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.420]  But the two days that I played with them,
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:13.580]  I really liked them.
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:16.900]  They still don't quite fit in my ears,
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:19.380]  but my ears have never liked,
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:22.860]  like I feel like I'm probably of the minority there.
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:26.500]  My ears just have a tendency, they're very small,
[02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:30.020]  so they have a tendency to like spit out in ear pods,
[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:31.580]  where they just don't, they're just like, no.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:33.420]  So it wasn't a, sorry?
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:35.780]  It's just interesting to me that the AirPods
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:38.060]  haven't shipped yet, they're at least a couple weeks away,
[02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:41.020]  but the Beats, one of the Beats ones that uses the W1
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.860]  is already shipping, so you could like,
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:44.340]  people have already bought it.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:49.340]  Yeah, you can start to play with the nifty Apple pairing,
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:52.780]  which I mean, that's pretty cool.
[02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:56.260]  I used them so exclusively that I didn't even realize,
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:30:00.340]  a 10.0.2 just came out, and it fixes a weird bug
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:05.060]  where the lightning headphones
[02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.820]  lose the ability to play pause.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:07.660]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:10.260]  I didn't catch that, because I don't use.
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:12.340]  I didn't catch it, because I think I've,
[02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:16.860]  I think I put my lightning ear pods in like for 30 seconds.
[02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:19.940]  Yep, they work, yep, they sound the same, back in the box.
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:22.860]  Yep, it's like, okay, just simple checks.
[02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:25.980]  Yeah, I switched, I really haven't used anything
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:29.020]  but Bluetooth headphones for the last six or seven months,
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:30.420]  and I'm okay with it.
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:32.060]  I can't wait for these AirPods to ship
[02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:33.060]  and for everybody to have them.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:35.020]  They're my favorite thing of the year.
[02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:37.820]  Yeah, I am gonna look into trying to,
[02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:40.620]  someone suggested putting Sugaru on the outsides
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:43.540]  to make them a little bit more pleasurably fitting
[02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:46.300]  to people with weird ears, and I'm like, I might try that,
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.180]  because I really love the concept of AirPods,
[02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:52.220]  and I think that even, especially on ladies, actually,
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:54.060]  I think they actually look pretty good in,
[02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:57.140]  because they almost look like earrings in a way,
[02:30:57.140 --> 02:30:58.420]  especially from far away.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:01.540]  You can't, it doesn't, my biggest fear was,
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:06.260]  oh my God, I'm gonna look like an obnoxious GPS,
[02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:09.420]  Bluetooth-like earpiece circa 2001.
[02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:12.220]  And they, you know, they're, I'm not gonna say
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:15.300]  they're the most artistically designed things in the world
[02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:18.460]  in terms of fashion forward, but they do look much better
[02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:19.740]  than I thought they were going to,
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:22.580]  and I feel like the way that you can move them in your ears
[02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:26.060]  to kind of tilt the end of the AirPod
[02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:28.980]  and the microphone kind of up or down is really,
[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:32.140]  it looks good, and the vocalization,
[02:31:32.140 --> 02:31:35.020]  especially when summoning Siri, is super impressive
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:36.780]  in terms of how low you can speak
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:38.820]  and still have Siri get your every word.
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:42.500]  It works, Siri, in the three days I used the AirPods,
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:44.900]  Siri worked better for me on the AirPods
[02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:47.300]  than she's ever worked for me on the watch,
[02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:49.340]  on the phone, or in the car.
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.180]  Interesting.
[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:53.740]  I've dictated some pretty complicated texts
[02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:55.900]  while wearing them or walking around the city,
[02:31:55.900 --> 02:31:59.180]  and it's pretty good.
[02:31:59.180 --> 02:32:00.540]  Yeah, I'm really impressed.
[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:02.620]  I will say this, too, as one last comment,
[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:06.500]  is wearing them now, and it is the, by far and away,
[02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:09.540]  I think it breaks the record of Apple Watch,
[02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:14.180]  of the Apple product that I've had pre-release access to
[02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:16.900]  that has generated random people on the streets
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:20.580]  and stores of Philadelphia to ask me, is that blank?
[02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:24.820]  Like, way back in 2007, there were a lot of people
[02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:27.780]  who asked me, I didn't have a pre-release iPhone then,
[02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:28.620]  but I bought one on day one.
[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:30.060]  But no one else did.
[02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:32.300]  Right, and people would say, is that an iPhone?
[02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:33.140]  Is that the iPhone?
[02:32:33.140 --> 02:32:36.220]  And in the Apple Watch two years ago,
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:38.420]  there was a lot of people, especially when I'd use
[02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:40.980]  the Apple Pay, the clerk at, you know,
[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:42.820]  Whole Foods was the first place that we had
[02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:43.900]  that supported it.
[02:32:45.180 --> 02:32:46.780]  Every single time I did it, they'd be like,
[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:48.660]  oh my God, did you just pay with your watch?
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:49.580]  That's amazing.
[02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:52.260]  But with these headphones, it breaks the record.
[02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:55.260]  Every, it's almost like I don't wanna wear them out
[02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:57.660]  because people just stop me and say, oh my God,
[02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.660]  how do you, are those the Apple things?
[02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.540]  And I say yes, and they're like, how do you have that?
[02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:05.100]  And it's like, I always just say, it's a long story.
[02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:07.100]  But they're like, do you like them?
[02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:08.540]  And I say, I love them.
[02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:10.660]  I cannot wait for everybody else to have them.
[02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:13.340]  But everybody, it's amazing to me just as a sign
[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:16.580]  of how much awareness regular people have.
[02:33:16.580 --> 02:33:20.380]  Just people running the register at the Acme supermarket,
[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:22.760]  you know, are totally aware of the fact
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.700]  that Apple has made, is coming out
[02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:27.540]  with these wireless ear pods.
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:29.980]  Yeah, well, it's funny to me,
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:33.780]  I don't really watch a lot of local news
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.580]  very much anymore, and I remember last year
[02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:40.740]  during the quote, unquote, tattoo gate story
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:45.860]  where I happened to have a person who was tattooed
[02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:49.100]  that I used to do tests on with the Apple Watch
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.380]  to make sure that the Apple Watch worked with tattoos.
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:54.180]  And then 24 hours later, because we were staying
[02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:57.580]  at my parents' at the time, that was on local news.
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.540]  And that was on local news in the morning,
[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:01.580]  that was on local news in the afternoon,
[02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:03.380]  that was on local news in the evening.
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:06.580]  Not necessarily my story, but just the idea of like,
[02:34:06.580 --> 02:34:08.720]  does the Apple Watch work with tattoos?
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:10.620]  Will your wrists be safe?
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:14.900]  And I don't think I really realized until that moment,
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:17.980]  and then until I started doing just semi,
[02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.540]  Renee and I occasionally do spots on CNBC and stuff,
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:27.540]  and realizing just how much the notion
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:31.380]  of Apple's dealings and day-to-day stuff
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:34.140]  is affected and shown on local news,
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:36.220]  and that everybody kind of knows what's going on.
[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:38.460]  It's still a little bit shocking at times.
[02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:39.500]  I know it's a big deal.
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:41.100]  I know Apple is a giant company,
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:43.060]  and that millions and billions of people
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.380]  pay attention to them.
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:48.620]  But it's sometimes hard to remember that
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:49.720]  when you're in your little bubble
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.780]  writing about camera tests, or like how a building zooms.
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:54.620]  Totally.
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:56.840]  All right, Renee, thank you so much for your time.
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:59.240]  Thank you for being here, what a great conversation.
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.580]  Like I said, you can find her on Twitter at Saturn,
[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:04.580]  and all of her work at iMore.
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:06.940]  Thanks very much, John.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:08.260]  Yeah, talk to you next time.
[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:36.260]  Yeah, definitely.
