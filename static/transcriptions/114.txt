[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  I've at least three episodes in a row where Skype has totally crapped out at some point. So that
[00:04.800 --> 00:12.160]  sounds like Skype. Yeah. All right, so we'll just start the show. So Serenity Caldwell,
[00:12.160 --> 00:18.880]  first time on the show. Welcome. Thank you. I'm excited to be here. Busy times. Yes, yes. Flying
[00:18.880 --> 00:25.120]  all over the place. Looking at fancy technology. I'm going to I was looking at my schedule and I'm
[00:25.120 --> 00:30.800]  like, I'm going to be in a different country and or state for the next like five weekends in a row,
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.680]  half of for my job and half for like roller derby randomness. And it's just like, it's too much,
[00:35.680 --> 00:38.720]  too much traveling. I don't even have an Apple Watch to keep track of it yet.
[00:39.360 --> 00:43.120]  It's bad when you start like when you have stretches like that, and you start to get to know
[00:43.120 --> 00:50.640]  like, certain TSA. Yeah, yeah. Where you're like, Hey, yep, I'm here again. Like you don't remember
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.400]  my name, but you know me. And they're just like, yeah, go on through. Yeah, exactly. It's like,
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.880]  okay, all right. Well, it's like with Boston, I fly Virgin pretty much anywhere. And it's like,
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.280]  there's only there's like this one tiny little security terminal for Boston's Virgin area. Like,
[01:05.280 --> 01:09.120]  we have our own private security terminal, which is really awesome. Because it's like,
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.440]  all right, quick in and out. No problems. But it also means that yeah, there are like,
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.200]  three TSA people total. So so yeah, it's like, maybe not by a name basis, but you get pretty
[01:19.200 --> 01:25.840]  familiar. Yeah, airports are so weird. We have like, a terminals ABCD, ENF here in Philly,
[01:25.840 --> 01:32.400]  but there's also like, I think it's like a one or something. There's like, there's like in between
[01:32.400 --> 01:37.600]  like A and B, there's like this little tiny thing. And it's like certain US air flights go out of
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.880]  there. And when you go up, it is there. It's like that. It's like literally like the security thing
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.880]  is like three TSA people. And the funny thing is, is that they still divide it between TSA pre
[01:48.880 --> 01:55.520]  and not pre. And there's never it's there's only three people there. It makes no difference. But
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.160]  yet somehow they put the they put the lines in. People need their status. Yeah, the Virgin there's
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.200]  you know, there's the silver and gold elevate line, which I think I've used maybe once in my
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.160]  life, because the line has been long, but otherwise, yeah, it's like two people. That's
[02:10.160 --> 02:17.680]  negligible. So you were out in California last week for watch song and pony show. What do they
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.000]  call it pony show? Something like that? Yeah, I like song and pony show. What's coming up?
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.240]  Alright, so I got Toronto this weekend for roller derby tournament, then Ireland, I'm going over to
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.280]  all, which is going to be fun. It's my first time in Dublin and just in Ireland in general,
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.120]  other than like flying through. So I'm psyched for that. Insert me crying here because I know
[02:39.120 --> 02:42.960]  I know can we can we like Skype you in and have you still do your dinner?
[02:42.960 --> 02:50.320]  We're I don't know. Yeah, yeah. It's trying to figure out something.
[02:50.320 --> 02:57.120]  It's a bummer. But yeah, so it's that and then I think I have a one one soul weekend where I'm in
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.800]  Massachusetts. And then I'm out in California for the Yosemite conference, and also to see my
[03:02.800 --> 03:09.440]  parents, and then potentially going to Oregon for another roller derby thing. So it's like,
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.480]  oh, wait, excuse me, Pittsburgh, then then Yosemite, then Oregon. It's a lot of stuff.
[03:16.480 --> 03:21.840]  Right. Yosemite is for the the Coco conf. Yeah, Coco conf.
[03:21.840 --> 03:25.920]  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. I remember Dave was pitching me on it a while back
[03:25.920 --> 03:31.040]  and I'm like, this sounds amazing. And it's like, why why not do a conference about technology
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.240]  in Yosemite like that? If Apple is going to go to the trouble of naming its OS
[03:36.240 --> 03:42.480]  updates after fancy California locations, why not hold a conference there? It's gorgeous.
[03:42.480 --> 03:46.800]  It makes me cry too. Because that was also with that's also something I wanted to go to something
[03:46.800 --> 03:50.720]  I was planning to go to and also within the still can't fly.
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.200]  Amtrak john to do an Amtrak blogging adventure.
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.200]  I looked into that I looked into that and Amtrak across the country is
[03:59.200 --> 04:06.320]  horrifying. Like it's clearly better to just drive. Yeah, it's it's a long experience.
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.960]  My buddy Rich Stevens, who does like a webcomic, he used to do that. I think the last two years
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.840]  that he went to San Diego Comic Con. He did that from Western Mass. And he really liked it because
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.640]  he's like, it's basically you know, I don't have to go anywhere. And it's Wi Fi the entire time and
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.480]  I don't have to worry about driving and I don't have to worry about like staying in crappy motels
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.800]  because I just have this like random bed. And then I get to go eat in big cities where they
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.240]  have like four hour layovers. So but but I feel like you kind of have to. You need to be in a
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.320]  certain mindset to be like, yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna basically live on a plane or a train for
[04:38.320 --> 04:44.400]  nine days and be surrounded by other people constantly. I think the way to go is the way
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.800]  john madden used to travel around the country. Do you remember this? john madden, the football
[04:48.800 --> 04:54.480]  announcer was had a terrible fear of flying or just hated it. It just hated hated flying. And so
[04:54.480 --> 05:00.640]  he had a like, I don't know if it was like a big bus. He just had a bus and had a you know, you
[05:00.640 --> 05:05.520]  know, he had lots of money because he was the top of course. So he just had like a crew and they
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.240]  just he just drove his bus everywhere. You know, like maybe this Sunday's game is in New York next
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.240]  Sunday's in Dallas and the next one's in San Francisco. They just you know, after the game,
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.400]  they just get in the bus and drive there. Oh, man. And I'm sure it was a pimped out bus too.
[05:18.400 --> 05:24.400]  Yeah, exactly. Right. Like with a kitchen and yeah, hot tub in the back. And like just that's that
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.560]  sounds kind of amazing. But I feel like you need it. You need a certain amount of lifestyle and
[05:29.120 --> 05:34.480]  money for you know, $10,000 Apple watches, right? And it's not I don't think it's worth a short term
[05:34.480 --> 05:40.560]  investment for a six to eight. But no, that would be like a good feature that maybe Uber could look
[05:40.560 --> 05:46.800]  into that. Like a temporary, like rock star tour bus. Yeah, exactly. Bus john Gruber around the
[05:46.800 --> 05:51.200]  country, right? But you could you could do a Patreon, a Patreon, a Kickstarter, one of those
[05:51.200 --> 05:55.600]  get me to get me to Yosemite still wouldn't get me to Ireland. But no, maybe Yosemite. You don't
[05:55.600 --> 06:00.800]  want to go on a boat. boats are scary. Well, you know what, it's funny, because we looked into it.
[06:00.800 --> 06:04.880]  I forget if I mentioned this on the show before, but we at least looked into you know, it's it
[06:04.880 --> 06:09.360]  seemed ridiculous. I mean, even then I've got my kid here at school, I can't. And I don't want to
[06:09.360 --> 06:15.840]  be away for weeks. But it even then it was hard because wool is too close to winter. So like,
[06:15.840 --> 06:22.240]  there aren't any any real cross cross Atlantic voyages. Well, there are but only they only go to
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.320]  Great Britain. It's funny because when you're flying if you're flying to Ireland,
[06:28.320 --> 06:36.400]  it's like if your itinerary is like Boston to London, what's the big one in London?
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.360]  Heathrow Heathrow. Yeah. And then he throw to Dublin, you don't think twice about it,
[06:41.360 --> 06:44.560]  you know, you know that there's a good chance you're not going to get a direct flight and you
[06:44.560 --> 06:48.720]  don't think twice about the fact but if you can't get in a plane, the fact that Ireland
[06:49.440 --> 06:53.440]  and England are not the same island, it makes all the difference in the world.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.320]  It would have been terrible. It was not terrible. But it's like,
[06:57.440 --> 07:01.360]  like you take like a Caribbean cruise and it's like you lay out in a deck and it's great. You
[07:01.360 --> 07:07.600]  take you know, like the Queen Elizabeth to England in late March. You know, you don't go outside.
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.960]  No, you hide in your cabin and you pray that you don't hit icebergs.
[07:10.960 --> 07:13.920]  So no, it's probably
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.320]  Alright, well, we'll get you like a roving. What are the iPad robots that just kind of
[07:20.320 --> 07:25.360]  glide around and you'd like pop into the rooms just float float your Twitter avatar?
[07:25.360 --> 07:31.040]  Yeah, it's like that. It's like a iPad on a little. What's that scooter called?
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.560]  Like a segue?
[07:32.560 --> 07:33.680]  A segue? Yeah.
[07:33.680 --> 07:37.840]  Yeah. I know there's an official name for it. Actually, it's funny. One of my former
[07:37.840 --> 07:43.360]  Macworld co workers, Roman Loyola reviewed one of these things for Macworld. And I feel it was
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.440]  something like two months after he reviewed it. He in it like accidentally ended up on the Colbert
[07:49.440 --> 07:56.720]  show because they used our clip of like the crazy iPad segue robot. So now he's forever like he's
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.280]  infamously known as like the Colbert iPad robot guy. Like he's gotten recognized as that. And it
[08:03.280 --> 08:04.000]  cracks me up.
[08:04.000 --> 08:15.360]  So let's revisit last week because I feel like everybody's still it's funny. I think now a week
[08:15.360 --> 08:20.720]  later, people are more upset about the MacBook part of the announcement than the Apple Watch.
[08:20.720 --> 08:25.280]  Yeah, I feel like you know, I was kind of expecting a lot of hoopla over the 10,000
[08:25.280 --> 08:31.360]  to $17,000 gold watch. And instead, it's everybody throwing their hands up in uproar.
[08:31.360 --> 08:39.760]  One port on a MacBook. How could you and I'm like, do you remember in 2008 when, when they
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.240]  pulled a computer out of a manila envelope, and it only had two USB ports and had no no CD drive
[08:46.240 --> 08:50.800]  and everybody, you know, like, I feel like this is the exact same argument just four or five years
[08:50.800 --> 08:57.200]  later. Yeah. I remember that event. I can't remember if it was WWDC or Macworld. Maybe it
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.000]  was Macworld. I think it was Macworld because I remember I wasn't working in the tech industry
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.320]  at the time. But I seem to remember pictures of like the MacBook Air is hanging on strings.
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.440]  Yeah, yeah. And I remember before the keynote, the banners said, there's something in the air.
[09:14.400 --> 09:20.800]  And for some reason, it's like the rumor the the 48 hour, you know, there's like that, that,
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.600]  like once certain signs start going up at, at Yerba Buena, or in this case, it was Moscone West,
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.000]  then the rumors reach a fever pitch, because people start trying to read into
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.160]  what it is that Apple has shown. Whereas anybody with any common sense would know
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.520]  that whatever they're showing you, that's not covered up, is is not going to give it away.
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.680]  Oh, no. And if anything, they're outright teasing you, because they know you're going to try and
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.680]  Kremlinology it to death. Right. And I remember that the rumor does I remember this, I usually
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.080]  the years blur together to me. But I remember this very distinctly was that the rumor du jour was
[09:56.640 --> 10:05.200]  that air was the name of Apple's in house flash killer. Oh, I remember that. And that it would
[10:05.200 --> 10:09.680]  be called air. And it was going to be and I remember saying, I don't think so. Because if
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.400]  it was, they wouldn't put the name of it on the banner. And B, I really think they mean it that
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.560]  they that they it's not just flashing, but they don't they don't want a proprietary binary blob
[10:20.560 --> 10:26.640]  thing on the web. Like they really do mean that they think HTML five is the way forward for the
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.560]  web. Like, I really think this is wrong. And then people were upset when they ended up being a
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.120]  notebook. They were like, Well, what happened to the flash killer? And it was like, they never
[10:37.120 --> 10:42.720]  said they were going to do a flash killer. No, you you whipped it up from thin air. Surprise.
[10:42.720 --> 10:49.280]  I was promised a flash killer. You were promised nothing. Right. Go play with your shiny new
[10:49.280 --> 10:59.440]  MacBook Air. Yeah, but the parallels to to that device, the first MacBook Air, I did almost exact
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.400]  other than the fact that they didn't pull it out of a minimal envelope. It's pretty much exact same
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.240]  scenario. Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's you have something that was like the 2000 MacBook Air. I
[11:10.240 --> 11:17.760]  was working at an Apple store at the time. And I mean, it was underpowered, too expensive, and not
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.840]  really designed for not really designed for the general public at that point. And everybody just
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.320]  kind of poo pooed and were like, Oh, this, you know, this computer is ridiculous. How do they
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.520]  expect us to use it? It's thin, and that's cool, but it's impractical, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.640]  blah. And now, you know, a couple years later, the entire laptop line is based off of the the
[11:40.640 --> 11:45.760]  innovations and the creations that originated from that 2008 MacBook Air. Here's here's where
[11:45.760 --> 11:52.480]  my memory gets fuzzy. I know that the base model still had a spinning hard drive. Yes. Was there
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.640]  an SSD option? I believe Yeah, there was an SSD option, but it was expensive. And it was like 64
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.760]  mega or 64 gigs. Yeah, I maybe it was 128. I can't remember now. I'm like, I sold I think four of
[12:05.760 --> 12:11.360]  these in the in the like two years I was working at the store. And granted, I wasn't on the floor
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.480]  a whole lot selling things like I was. I taught classes most of the time. But even so it was like
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.080]  the only time that you got to get a MacBook Air out from like the back of house storage was when
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.280]  like somebody in a fancy suit came in who was like, Oh, I just need a I need a third laptop for
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.640]  travel. Like it was definitely a high end business demands. Like I'm sitting on a plane for a long
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.160]  period of time and I want to work on like a super light computer sort of thing. It was wicked
[12:38.160 --> 12:47.520]  expensive. Here's here it is. Jackie Chang had an article on it for ours. Back in February 2008.
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.080]  I'm copying this URL right now. The famous last words on this show is I say it's going to be in
[12:52.080 --> 12:57.840]  the show notes and then I forget to put it in the show notes. But I've got it in my bb edit file
[12:57.840 --> 13:06.160]  right now. It costs 1300 extra. And it was 64 gigabytes. Oh my god. So the high end air in in
[13:06.160 --> 13:17.680]  early 2008 was Alright, so the regular one MacBook Air or the hard drive 1.6 gigahertz into core to
[13:17.680 --> 13:23.920]  do. Yep. Both of them only had two gigs of RAM. Oh, yeah. And they had the other the spinning
[13:23.920 --> 13:30.880]  hard disk one only had an 80 gig hard drive, an 80 gig for 420 rpm hard drive, and then the 64
[13:30.880 --> 13:39.280]  gigabyte solid state drive was an extra $1300. So in other words, the cost of the entire new MacBook
[13:40.080 --> 13:46.400]  exactly the same price, like for an entirely new MacBook, it was what it cost to upgrade to the
[13:46.400 --> 13:53.280]  SSD. So I guess that was like $3100. Yeah, something like that. Wasn't it 1800? I want to
[13:53.280 --> 13:59.440]  say it was 17 or $1800. I'm trying to pull this. See, I'm trying to pull this up somewhere.
[14:02.720 --> 14:06.560]  Of course, I'm looking at an old mackerel review. And of course, we don't have the price anywhere.
[14:06.560 --> 14:12.000]  That's helpful. What's wrong with these people? That's it from now on. I'm just making articles
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.880]  that have prices. No, it's a but it was pretty. Here we go. Yeah. 1799 was the base configuration.
[14:18.880 --> 14:26.880]  So it was $3100 to get it with an SSD. And truth be told, you really weren't getting the MacBook
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.840]  Air experience without an SSD. Oh, no. And it's clear they came out with it. And the reason they
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.800]  had the one with the hard drive was because SSDs were so insanely expensive in 2008. Yeah,
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.080]  2008, that they really did not want to have the base model be $3100. It just the optics would
[14:42.080 --> 14:48.640]  just be bad. But that really was the one to get to to get the experience like that was clearly
[14:48.640 --> 14:54.240]  where they were going. And you know, I think it was within a year they dropped the hard drives.
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.920]  Oh, yeah, it was. Well, I remember the the 2010 MacBook Airs. And that was the first MacBook Air
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.720]  I owned when when they came out with the 11 inch and the 13 inch. And all of a sudden, not only
[15:04.720 --> 15:10.720]  were the MacBook Airs affordable, but they were in super tiny, you know, court or a PowerBook Duo
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.720]  style builds. And I was like, All right, I can I can deal with two USB ports if it you know,
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.920]  if it comes in an 11 inch size. Sure. I remember I remember I think it was Will Shipley. I think
[15:21.920 --> 15:27.120]  he had the first air I think anybody had the SSD one and he was doing, you know, software
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.280]  development on it, which sounds crazy because like you said, it was overall in grand scheme of things
[15:31.280 --> 15:36.800]  and underpowered device. But I remember him right. And if it wasn't the first gen one, he had a very
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.600]  early one in the very early days when they were relatively expensive and relatively slow in terms
[15:41.600 --> 15:49.120]  of CPU performance. And he raved about it because the SSD was so great at like, when you're compiling
[15:49.120 --> 15:54.000]  stuff with Xcode, you're touching lots and lots hundreds of little files very quickly. And that's
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.640]  where an SSD blows a spinning hard drive away is touching lots of lots of little files in right
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.600]  one after another after another. And so for compiling stuff in Xcode, he's here. I remember
[16:05.600 --> 16:09.120]  him writing about it was like, this is a fantastic machine. I cannot wait for the future when
[16:09.120 --> 16:14.480]  everything is SSD. So there were definitely people who loved it. And it was there. But it's, you know,
[16:14.480 --> 16:19.920]  it was, it was ahead of its time. Oh, yeah. Do you remember the first computer you had that hasn't
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.920]  had an SSD in it? Because I know for me, it was it was life changing. Yeah, it was my 15 inch
[16:25.920 --> 16:35.120]  MacBook Pro or no, no, maybe it wasn't a MacBook Pro. I mean, I was gonna say a PowerBook it was it
[16:35.120 --> 16:43.680]  was a MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook Pro that didn't ship with an SSD I bought it. That's actually the
[16:43.680 --> 16:49.760]  last time I ever upgraded a Mac after I bought it too. But I bought like an OWC upgrade package.
[16:49.760 --> 16:56.480]  And it was like getting a new machine. I got it did it like two years after I bought it.
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.840]  And it really did. You know, I don't know what it cost me maybe like $800. And it felt like
[17:01.840 --> 17:06.800]  I just got a new $2,000 MacBook Pro. It was crazy. Like I actually I did the same thing
[17:06.800 --> 17:14.800]  after I bought my my 2010 MacBook Air. And I you know, going from I had a 15 inch MacBook Pro that
[17:14.800 --> 17:20.240]  was running on a spinning disk. And once I got the air was it was like night and day where it's like
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.960]  the pro, the pro despite being I think three or four times as powerful as the air felt like it
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.120]  was, you know, running in molasses. And I was just like, ah, screw this computer, I'm just going to
[17:31.120 --> 17:36.000]  use the air for full time, you know, doing everything. And when I started doing video
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.080]  development, I was like, all right, you know what, maybe I need to consider, can I put an SSD in the
[17:42.080 --> 17:47.840]  pro? And then when I did, it was exactly how you described. It's like it, it turns the machine
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.640]  upside down into a brand new device. Like it doesn't, it doesn't feel like you're working
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.800]  on a two or three year old computer anymore, despite the fact that the internals might be,
[17:56.800 --> 18:02.880]  you know, severely outdated. Yeah. And it's like in every, you know, I probably everybody listening
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.920]  is I mean, I wonder what percentage of people are on SSDs now. Yeah, well, I think well,
[18:07.920 --> 18:13.440]  most of the laptops now have SSD standard, but it's the, it's the iMacs that are still a little
[18:13.440 --> 18:19.120]  tricky. I, we were talking about this before the show, where my, my iMac is fixing out right now,
[18:19.120 --> 18:24.560]  because I think the hard drive is slowly dying. And it's a, it's a normal spinning, spinning
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.400]  platter. And I didn't even realize that when I, when I got the computer, I thought that it would,
[18:30.400 --> 18:34.560]  it came with an SSD standard. Of course, I had my company, you know, the company ordered it for me.
[18:34.560 --> 18:40.320]  And I was just kind of like, everything comes with SSDs now it's, it's 20, you know, 2012, 2013.
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.600]  Like that's, that's no question. And then at some point I'm like, man, this iMac is really slow
[18:45.600 --> 18:50.720]  compared to my, you know, my tiny little laptop. And I finally realized, oh, it has a hard drive
[18:50.720 --> 18:56.800]  in it. So I feel like people who have the desktop computers may not like the standard configuration
[18:56.800 --> 19:03.280]  for an iMac is I believe a big hard drive and like, yeah, terabyte hard drive is really tempting.
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.560]  But like, you don't need a terabyte of space. I'm just looking now there's the standard config for
[19:08.560 --> 19:15.520]  every iMac is a hard drive except the retina 5k iMac, which still is a fusion drive, which is the
[19:15.520 --> 19:22.080]  the, you know, the crazy, it looks like one volume, but it's an SSD and a hard drive combined,
[19:22.080 --> 19:28.640]  right, which is a really good, fascinating technology and really cool. And it seems,
[19:28.640 --> 19:32.880]  you know, a couple of years in, it seems like it works really well in practice.
[19:32.880 --> 19:39.280]  Oh, yeah. Well, I'm there. So I know a couple people in the PC building industry and like,
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.000]  that's, that's been really popular for a while putting in an SSD and a big hard drive.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.800]  But with the PC market, it was put the boot drive on the SSD and then all the other files
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.640]  on the hard drive and the fusion drive, as far as I understand it, it all happens under the hood
[19:54.640 --> 20:00.080]  and it and it's seamless. So not only is the boot drive on the SSD, but any files that you're
[20:00.080 --> 20:05.200]  currently working on get pulled over magically to the SSD. And theoretically, you shouldn't notice
[20:05.200 --> 20:11.440]  it. So you're never you never really should be drawing any files actively off of the hard drive.
[20:11.440 --> 20:15.680]  It's just where, you know, inactive files live, kind of like old school memory. And I'm like,
[20:15.680 --> 20:19.760]  that's, that's really cool. That's a like, that's a great piece of technology.
[20:19.760 --> 20:22.640]  Yeah, but it still doesn't save you from the lack of reliability.
[20:22.640 --> 20:26.960]  Oh, no, you know, and performance stuff eventually, you know, depending on what you do
[20:26.960 --> 20:31.440]  it the performance eventually, eventually you suffer and you get the performance of
[20:31.440 --> 20:36.880]  a spinning hard disk, depending on what you're doing. Yeah, exactly. All hard drives eventually
[20:36.880 --> 20:43.360]  die, right importing a bunch of file or photos into iPhoto or exporting them out or something
[20:43.360 --> 20:46.560]  like that, anything like that, where you're looking at, you know, you're gonna, you know,
[20:46.560 --> 20:52.320]  looking at a gig or two of data, it's, you know, you're clearly can't make, you know,
[20:52.320 --> 20:58.800]  can't put 50 pounds of data in it. No, it can only hold so much before it has to look to the
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.640]  heavyweight, even if the heavyweight is, you know, has a speed of one.
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.400]  Right. But all you're right, though, all the all the notebooks now are SSD. I mean,
[21:06.400 --> 21:11.440]  I guess you can still get like, if you cheap out and get the cheap MacBook Pros, they still
[21:11.440 --> 21:17.440]  come with hard disks. The retina ones all are SSD. And the errors are all SSD.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.600]  Yeah, it's that I haven't actually looked at the store configuration since last week,
[21:21.600 --> 21:27.600]  since last week event, does the does the 13 inch non retina MacBook Pro still exist?
[21:27.600 --> 21:31.680]  Is that still a configuration? Or did the the new MacBook officially just know it?
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.680]  It's still it's still is their MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.5 gigahertz. It's only 1099.
[21:39.840 --> 21:46.080]  But it's a 500 gigabyte 5400 RPM hard drive and four gigs of RAM. I'm honestly I'm,
[21:46.080 --> 21:51.440]  that's to me a sort of a baffling configuration to me. I can't see why anyone would buy that.
[21:51.440 --> 21:57.760]  The only if your price is 1099 and you're really kind of price sensitive, and you don't want that
[21:57.760 --> 22:02.480]  $1300 retina one. I really can't see why you don't just get the air.
[22:02.480 --> 22:09.760]  Yeah, I suspect that that configuration must solely exist for education, maybe with the idea
[22:09.760 --> 22:15.120]  of like education, folks who want to do video editing or something like that. But even then,
[22:15.120 --> 22:21.440]  like, the errors are pretty good for video editing at this point, like the the core i7s that they
[22:21.440 --> 22:29.520]  they have available. Like, I routinely use my 11 inch for for a lot of video, video intensive
[22:29.520 --> 22:34.960]  stuff that I'm probably not supposed to. But it's definitely like, it's functional. It's not,
[22:34.960 --> 22:39.520]  you know, it's, I don't know, my son and I went into the Apple Store just the other day because
[22:39.520 --> 22:46.640]  I forget we had a he had a weird issue with his his MacBook Pro that we couldn't fix at home.
[22:46.640 --> 22:53.120]  And it ended up the genius just needed to remember the SMC reset system memory controller. And the
[22:53.120 --> 22:58.400]  old way to do it in the old days was you to take the battery out. Or if it was a desktop,
[22:58.400 --> 23:04.000]  you'd unplug it doesn't work so well with No, and there's a keyboard shortcut, you hold down
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.960]  shift option control, I think on the left side of the keyboard, shift option control, not command,
[23:11.520 --> 23:16.560]  and restart. And then the if you have it plugged in, you know that it did the SMC reset because
[23:16.560 --> 23:25.360]  the color will change on the mag safe from like green to orange or orange to green. But it didn't
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.080]  solve it for him is it just wouldn't turn on the screen wouldn't turn on. So I thought it
[23:30.080 --> 23:34.480]  was bad news, like, God's, you know, it's gonna need to be replaced. It's under warranty. It's
[23:34.480 --> 23:39.200]  relatively new. But ended up he just needed to take it back in their secret lab and take the
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.880]  battery out. And then it just started right out. So anyway, all you know, all went well with that.
[23:45.920 --> 23:50.800]  But while we were there, I was like, we got to try out this new force touch trackpad. And we went
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.840]  over to the table with the 13 inch MacBook Pros. And the first one we went to was the low end one
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.240]  that doesn't have the new trackpad, and doesn't even have a retina screen. And we were both like,
[24:00.240 --> 24:07.360]  Oh, gross. I was so proud of him. He was grossed out by the non retina screen. Yeah, who would buy
[24:07.360 --> 24:13.120]  this? It really is starkly different. Once you get used to the retina. I remember having a
[24:13.120 --> 24:20.720]  conversation. I want to say the year before we got the iPhone four, I want to say, where I was
[24:20.720 --> 24:23.920]  talking with a friend of mine, and he's like, I just don't understand why Apple just doesn't do
[24:23.920 --> 24:27.520]  retina screens. Like they didn't we didn't call them retina at that point. But I don't understand
[24:27.520 --> 24:34.480]  why Apple doesn't do high DPI screens, because they have the technology. And text looks terrible.
[24:34.480 --> 24:38.960]  And as a designer, I want to see things clearly. And that's the next generation of technology. And
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.000]  like, two weeks after we have this conversation, the new iPhone comes out. And he was like a kid
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.200]  at Christmas, he was just like, Oh, my God, I can't wait until I have this in my iMac. It's it's
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.160]  it's it's it really is, you know, it's stark. It's it's one of the few things that I'm sorely
[24:54.160 --> 24:58.160]  kind of missing on my MacBook Air right now. I don't I don't know if the new MacBook is
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.960]  currently enough for me that I would swap over, but it's definitely tempting.
[25:02.960 --> 25:06.240]  Yeah, just for right now. Yeah, but force touch. Oh, my God.
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.520]  All right. Hold that thought. Let's talk about force touch. And let me let me take a breakdown
[25:09.520 --> 25:15.520]  do the first sponsor. Let's do our good friends at Squarespace. You know, Squarespace, that's
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.440]  where you go. If you have you need to make a website, go to Squarespace, they do everything
[25:19.440 --> 25:26.240]  you can register domains, you get templates to start from, and you can build any type of website
[25:26.800 --> 25:30.720]  with Squarespace, you want to build an online store, you can build an online store, they already
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.720]  have that as a component, they already handle all the commerce, they handle the credit card
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.400]  processing, all the security, making sure everything goes through SSL instead of unencrypted
[25:40.400 --> 25:47.680]  over everything like that is just built into everybody's Squarespace account. All their
[25:47.680 --> 25:56.960]  templates are responsive. Everything looks great from a four inch phone to a 27 inch 5k cinema
[25:56.960 --> 26:06.400]  display iMac. And you can get started free of charge, you get a whole month, just go there,
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.520]  sign up, start using it and your website fully functional, no limits for a full month before
[26:11.520 --> 26:18.720]  you have to pay a nickel. It's a tremendous deal. And plans start at a ridiculous eight
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.160]  bucks a month. It's ridiculous that you get all this for eight bucks a month.
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.920]  They have a new new back end, they call it Squarespace seven, you can find out all the
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.680]  new features because Squarespace has been sponsoring podcasts for years. So you know,
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.680]  you've heard of them, you've and everybody listening has heard of them, you want to find
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.560]  out what's new, that you go to Squarespace comm slash seven se ven spell it out like the,
[26:45.280 --> 26:51.680]  like the David Fincher movie. And they've got a great, great site that explains all the new stuff,
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.080]  I could go on for minutes and minutes and minutes with all the new stuff. But the biggest thing,
[26:56.080 --> 27:00.240]  the fundamental thing that they've really emphasized in Squarespace seven is making
[27:00.240 --> 27:06.160]  everything visual. They've always been graphical, it's always been a great platform for non technical
[27:06.160 --> 27:12.320]  people to set up their own website. But now, it's so WYSIWYG, it's ridiculous. It's the
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.920]  the WYSIWYG web editor that people have been looking for for 20 years, like what you see when
[27:17.920 --> 27:21.040]  you're logged into your Squarespace account, if you want to move something from the left to the
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.440]  right, you just move it from the left to the right, and then boom, it save it and it's moved
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.240]  from the left to the right for everybody who visits your website could not be more obvious
[27:30.240 --> 27:37.120]  and visual. So go there, check it out, check out the new features and Squarespace seven
[27:37.120 --> 27:43.120]  and go to if you want to go just to start and then know that you came from the show,
[27:43.120 --> 27:49.200]  go to Squarespace comm slash Gruber. That's the URL that lets people know you're coming
[27:49.200 --> 27:53.760]  from the talk show. And then when you do sign up, which you won't have to do for an entire month,
[27:53.760 --> 27:59.600]  because you get the whole month free, but when you do sign up, use the code JG and you will save
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.640]  10% on your first order. You could save a lot of money that way. So my thanks to Squarespace,
[28:06.640 --> 28:09.600]  check them out. If you have any sort of desire to build a website, go check them out.
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.080]  All right, force touch, force touch. Do you think that's a good name?
[28:15.200 --> 28:22.720]  I am conflicted only if only because they're calling. They're calling this the gestures
[28:22.720 --> 28:27.440]  force touch, and they're calling the trackpad force touch. And I feel like the same problem
[28:27.440 --> 28:33.040]  with you know, having a collection of the watch just called the watch. It's hard to describe
[28:33.040 --> 28:38.480]  the gesture and also inadvertently describe the trackpad itself, you know, like, we got to figure
[28:38.480 --> 28:45.520]  out specific language, but I think that's just a that's, that's a journalist word problem. It's not
[28:45.520 --> 28:53.920]  a bad name overall, I don't think. Right. So as a verb, it means to press a finger hard, either on
[28:53.920 --> 29:00.080]  your watch or on this new trackpad to engage whatever it is that forts touch does in your
[29:00.080 --> 29:07.200]  current context. And the trackpad itself is called the force touch trackpad. Yeah, I, I,
[29:07.200 --> 29:14.880]  here's why I bring this up because Dieter bone at the verge had an article that you know, great
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.840]  trackpad except for the lousy name, or something like that. Yeah, I was talking about lousy name.
[29:19.840 --> 29:24.400]  Number one, most people like, have no idea what it's not like they're really going to advertise,
[29:24.400 --> 29:30.080]  I don't think that the name force touch trackpad. It's just a way to distinguish it. And then like,
[29:30.080 --> 29:33.920]  you know, as the time goes on, if you have like a 13 inch MacBook Pro, you could say is that the
[29:33.920 --> 29:38.960]  one with the force touch trackpad or not? It just is a way to clarify whether it can do it or not.
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.600]  Yeah, it's like retina display or anything, anything else that that Apple's use descriptive
[29:43.600 --> 29:52.640]  names for? Yeah, I see really no problem with it. And it's honestly it's a it I feel like it's a
[29:52.640 --> 29:58.160]  good descriptor. What what how would you rather describe it like the taptic engine trackpad,
[29:58.160 --> 30:03.280]  the haptic trackpad, like then you start the only other thing I've heard that was even plausible
[30:03.280 --> 30:09.280]  would be to call it the taptic trackpad. Yeah, isn't bad. I bet it's close enough that it was
[30:09.280 --> 30:14.240]  probably like on the finalists list. You know, like a whiteboard and Phil Schiller's office
[30:14.240 --> 30:20.640]  and it says like force touch trackpad taptic trackpad taptic engine trackpad trackpad. Yeah.
[30:20.640 --> 30:23.760]  And no, there's like a circle around force touch trackpad.
[30:23.760 --> 30:29.440]  Exactly with stars. I Yeah, I like it better than I used I think both descriptions when I was
[30:29.440 --> 30:34.560]  writing about it in our hands on and I like force touch trackpad as a as a moniker or just force
[30:34.560 --> 30:39.920]  touch technology in general, because especially, you know, we've seen it on the watch. Now we've
[30:39.920 --> 30:45.120]  we're seeing it on a trackpad that's essentially the size of an iPhone six screen. I don't think
[30:45.120 --> 30:51.680]  it's unlikely that we'll see it on iOS devices in the next year or so. And as a result, like you,
[30:51.680 --> 30:56.320]  you're gonna need a you're gonna need a way to describe it versus you know, you got a retina
[30:56.320 --> 31:01.360]  display with with force touch multi touch technology. That's a lot of touches. But you
[31:01.360 --> 31:08.080]  know what I mean? Right? Right. Yeah, it's I and the complaint against it and I I'm as
[31:08.080 --> 31:12.880]  juvenile as anybody I think but the complaint is that it's you know, like Har Har you know,
[31:12.880 --> 31:19.440]  it's sounds like rape force touch. Right. And I kind of feel like you can't anything touch
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.400]  can be made into that type of joke like multi touch clearly can and it reminds me of the
[31:24.400 --> 31:30.640]  complaints that iPad iPad Yeah, sounded like you know, a feminine hygiene product. And it's like
[31:30.640 --> 31:36.720]  really, you know, it's, you know, I'd remember not being in love with iPad when they first said it,
[31:36.720 --> 31:41.920]  but I didn't think well, this is awful. Yeah, it's not the worst name in the world there. There are
[31:41.920 --> 31:48.320]  plenty of more terrible names that I'm sure we would be much more in arms about had Apple chosen
[31:48.320 --> 31:53.200]  to use those instead of their preformed ones when we were when we were playing the What are they
[31:53.200 --> 31:58.880]  going to call their tablet guessing game? I didn't guess iPad but my only but it was one of the ones
[31:58.880 --> 32:04.480]  that was tossed out because it seemed kind of obvious and my only brush aside of iPad was it
[32:04.480 --> 32:10.160]  sounds and looks too much like iPod so they're not going to do that. And they just went ahead
[32:10.160 --> 32:17.520]  and did it and like I spent two years on this show calling it an iPod. So I was right that it was
[32:17.520 --> 32:21.440]  very similar but it's like they did just didn't care. But that's how I feel about the force touch
[32:21.440 --> 32:26.480]  thing. It's like come on. It's not that bad a name. Yeah. And it's Yeah, as I said, it's a it's
[32:26.480 --> 32:32.000]  a good descriptor of what it I mean, either that or they could have called it the magical what's
[32:32.000 --> 32:38.080]  it trackpad you won't believe is actually doing. Like, I you I mean, you got a chance to test it
[32:38.080 --> 32:42.320]  out in the store. It feels wacky, right? It's crazy. You really it's just like Matthew
[32:42.320 --> 32:47.040]  Panzarino said on my show last week that it's he didn't he didn't really wreck it. He didn't know
[32:47.040 --> 32:51.440]  that it wasn't clicking until they like he kind of because you miss it when you're sitting there
[32:51.440 --> 32:58.720]  in the room watching the keynote. Like, it's, you can't rewind, right? I mean, that's it. That was
[32:58.720 --> 33:02.880]  the one thing that like having, you know, getting for the first time in years getting to watch one
[33:02.880 --> 33:08.000]  remotely instead of there. You definitely it's easier, you know, to you can pause for a second
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.600]  and write your note and then you know, just fall behind by 10 seconds in the stream and go when
[33:11.600 --> 33:16.640]  you're in the room, you miss stuff and he missed the emphasis that it doesn't actually move. And so
[33:16.640 --> 33:20.560]  he went in the hands on area and was like, this is great. You know, it's neat the way it clicks
[33:20.560 --> 33:22.880]  and they're like, well, it doesn't really click. And he's like, what are you talking about? And
[33:22.880 --> 33:26.640]  then they told him and he was like, that's not true. And they like to turn the machine off for
[33:26.640 --> 33:30.960]  him. So he could try it when the machine was off. And you know, it doesn't move. Yeah, that's
[33:30.960 --> 33:36.480]  uncanny. And that's the baffling part is I didn't get a chance to try it out until until this week
[33:36.480 --> 33:41.920]  with with the machine completely off. I went to an Apple store. And that is when you realize, oh,
[33:41.920 --> 33:49.120]  this is actually some high level wizardry crap like this. I know what it is doing. In theory,
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.400]  like I know that you know, the it's not electromagnets, but it's it's something similar.
[33:54.400 --> 33:59.120]  I know that it's basically sending it sending vibrations to my finger that make it feel like
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.560]  a click even though my finger is moving sideways. But in my brain, it feels like I am pressing down
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.640]  and the trackpad is physically depressing. And that's even more so I don't know if they they had
[34:10.640 --> 34:15.440]  like different apps on the app at the Apple store that you were playing with. But like, I got to
[34:15.440 --> 34:19.600]  play with it in a couple of different things, including QuickTime. And the QuickTime one was
[34:19.600 --> 34:25.760]  the really sort of crazy wacky my brain is being slowly disassembled into mush thing. Because when
[34:25.760 --> 34:30.640]  you're in when you're in QuickTime with force touch, and you press the fast forward button,
[34:30.640 --> 34:35.840]  as you like put a little bit more pressure on the trackpad, it speeds up to the point where it like
[34:35.840 --> 34:42.320]  it speeds up like 60 times. But you can slowly release that pressure while your finger is still
[34:42.320 --> 34:49.120]  down, and the speed starts to slow down again. So it feels almost like a gas pedal worth of worth
[34:49.120 --> 34:55.840]  of trackpad where you're like, like that, I don't know, it's such a it's such a different experience
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.760]  that I've ever had on a computer. Like, I mean, that's a that's a technological, like, that's old
[35:01.760 --> 35:07.280]  school, right? Cars have had that kind of control for years. But being able to do that on a flat
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.360]  glass surface was was really kind of mind bogglingly, you know, time bendingly crazy.
[35:13.920 --> 35:17.600]  Yeah, which in turn makes me wonder about like the gaming implications.
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.760]  Oh, yeah, the gaming implications, the drawing implications, you know,
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.040]  drawing pressure since I love that on the on the MacBook website, where they're like,
[35:27.600 --> 35:33.680]  pressure sensitive drawing, and then they show a picture of the the preview signature.
[35:33.680 --> 35:38.480]  Because that's the that's the only thing that Apple has in its default apps that can accurately
[35:38.480 --> 35:43.120]  show pressure sensitive drawing. But as soon as they started talking about that, and I like,
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.480]  I quiz the Apple reps pretty in depthly being like, so pressure sensitivity, how many levels
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.960]  do you have? Like, what, what are we talking about here? And they are, of course, very,
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.680]  very charmingly vague as always, but, but what I was able to get out is like, there's a,
[35:57.680 --> 36:03.200]  there's a fair amount of ramp built into the built into the underlying software technology
[36:03.200 --> 36:08.400]  of Force Touch, which means and and the fact that it's available as an SDK for developers
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.640]  to hook into. It basically means that like developers can set sort of click points and
[36:14.640 --> 36:19.840]  pressure points at any point like along this curve, this this, you know, pressure sensitivity
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.920]  curve. So in theory, you could, you could have any number of pressure points or any number of,
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.280]  you know, multiple clicks. And I just think about like, going back to games for a second,
[36:31.280 --> 36:37.360]  I think about playing Wow, in college and having to go get like a six button mouse to like map all
[36:37.360 --> 36:44.320]  of my key combos, too. And I'm like, with a Force Touch trackpad, in theory, you could have like a
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.680]  different level of pressure touch for each key combo, or each like mouse combo that you'd
[36:49.680 --> 36:54.880]  normally need, like an up button, a down button, a side button, a squeeze button, like that,
[36:54.880 --> 36:57.280]  that is that is really, really nifty to me.
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.160]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, and I think about like, how, when you
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.520]  get really into, like the type of software you specialize in, like, if you're an audio editor,
[37:09.520 --> 37:15.120]  or a video editor, and you just live and breathe in, you know, you're editing software. And once
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.880]  that's Force Touched enabled for like scrubbing, you know, which is clearly I mean, like you said,
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.040]  it's already built into QuickTime. So it's clearly, you know, that's the way things are going.
[37:25.040 --> 37:30.400]  But you'll, you'll be able like once you're, you know, and you do it 4050 60 hours a week,
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.440]  it's like, you'll be able to play that scrub controller, like playing a musical instrument,
[37:35.440 --> 37:38.080]  you know, in terms of going faster and slower with your touch.
[37:38.080 --> 37:39.920]  Jennifer Yeah, I mean, did you see the
[37:40.720 --> 37:47.680]  there was an iMovie update a couple days ago that came out with support for Force Touch trackpads.
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.880]  And it offer it came with two different things, one of which I think is the scrubbing feature.
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.680]  And the other was there's a little bit now when you kind of scroll through a clip,
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.920]  you get a little bit of haptic feedback when you come to the end of a clip, or you bump at the end
[38:01.920 --> 38:08.240]  of the clip. So I mean, I'm like, I didn't even think about that. Where it's, again, texture,
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.200]  as well as physical clicking. Yeah.
[38:11.200 --> 38:16.080]  Trenton Larkin It really brings back analog sensibility.
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.240]  Jennifer Yeah. Well, I mean,
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.840]  you remember the knobs like the the USB knobs that I want to say it's Kensington that makes them
[38:25.120 --> 38:32.960]  where it glowed blue. Yeah, Kensington or Belkin or something like that. But like, I knew editors
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.680]  who absolutely relied on those knobs are like, yeah, this is as close as I'm going to get to
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.600]  a physical editing machine. And it's like, well, five years down the line. Now you now you
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.400]  potentially have a trackpad that can do all of that. What? What is this madness?
[38:46.400 --> 38:48.400]  Trenton Larkin That's great. I never even thought
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.360]  about that, though. But that's brilliant, though, to have like, just like a slight
[38:51.360 --> 38:56.240]  tick as you get between clicks, and then you can feel it. And it's again, like, you go back to like
[38:56.240 --> 39:01.920]  the analog era, when you people you know, like to edit film, you'd literally splice pieces of
[39:01.920 --> 39:07.840]  film together. And at that splice, there'd be a physical, you know, like, where you just pretty
[39:07.840 --> 39:11.680]  much just put tape around it, you know? Jennifer Yeah. Well, it's funny to me,
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.240]  because you think on the on the software side, Apple has been working harder and harder to kind
[39:16.240 --> 39:22.880]  of take the skeuomorphism out of the design. But I feel like in a large way, they're kind of putting
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.840]  that into hardware. So it's like, we don't necessarily need our video clips to look like
[39:27.840 --> 39:33.680]  analog video clips anymore. But we're going to give you more and more controls on the physical
[39:33.680 --> 39:38.800]  side that make it feel like you're dealing with tangible materials that make it feel like you're
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.280]  actually interacting with something besides glass. It's I don't know, it feels like that, you know,
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.040]  the the idea of the iPad or the iPhone as blank slate was step one, where it's like, okay, you can
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.520]  load anything on it. Now, we're gonna let you touch anything on it. Now.
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.640]  Where else could you do that? Like, I'm even imagining like, in the future, if it gets more
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.880]  refined, like, like, as you like, if you're editing text, and you have like a red squiggly
[40:04.880 --> 40:10.320]  underlined word that's misspelled, like, maybe you get like a slight, as you move the arrow over it,
[40:10.320 --> 40:15.440]  it it buzzes. Yeah, like just a little bit of friction or something. Yeah. Just, well,
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.680]  yeah, it makes your scroll slightly slower, right? Like, maybe you want to stop here.
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.800]  Yeah. Well, and the accessibility implications, too, are huge. Like, imagine instead of having
[40:24.800 --> 40:31.440]  to have a braille keyboard or a braille touchpad, turning on maybe accessibility braille or
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.520]  something like that. And then all of a sudden, you know, you're, you're moving your cursor
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.320]  over words, and it feels like the braille version of the word. Like, obviously, that's probably
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.400]  years down the line, but it's still like, the potential of that is really cool.
[40:44.400 --> 40:46.960]  Right. Or anytime it hovers over a button, really.
[40:46.960 --> 40:53.920]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Popping out buttons. I'm sure, just like with almost every SDK that has weird,
[40:53.920 --> 40:58.560]  crazy things like this, I'm sure that everybody and their mother is going to make buttons that
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.640]  give you haptic feedback for like the first year, right? Where you like, you roll over it,
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.240]  it's like every single button goes like, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. But as people kind of get
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.520]  more used to it, I feel like we could, we can have some really, really revolutionary stuff.
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.840]  Yeah, the thing that really blew me away was, and I've known this, because I've, I've never been
[41:18.400 --> 41:25.040]  fully on board with their getting rid of the separate buttons for the trackpad. So like,
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.680]  you know, like, step one was they got rid of buttons and made the whole trackpad button.
[41:29.680 --> 41:30.000]  Yeah.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.040]  And I've never been fully on board with that. Because, and Schiller, you know, showed the
[41:35.600 --> 41:40.160]  mechanics of it exactly, because it's like a teeter totter with the fulcrum at the top.
[41:40.160 --> 41:41.520]  Yeah, you can't click on the top.
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.680]  It's hard to click on the top. And I click at the top way more than I click at the bottom,
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.800]  because the menus bars at the top, you know, the close button for Windows is at the top,
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.840]  the tabs are at the top. So I've never been fully on board with that, because the trackpad
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.840]  clicks better at the bottom. And even for years, I guess I've kind of gotten away from it. But the
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.560]  way that you can still keep your thumb at the bottom and just do all your clicks there, even
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.240]  if you're, you know, moving it, they kind of let you treat it like the buttons are still there at
[42:10.240 --> 42:16.160]  the bottom. With the force touch trackpad, the click is the same everywhere. Yeah. And it's
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.400]  like, this is the first one, we're not having the standalone buttons. There's no trade off involved.
[42:20.400 --> 42:26.480]  Katie Grant No, it is really cool. Like, I intentionally, when I played around with it
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.400]  in the hands on, I intentionally was like, clicking in corners, trying to like, see,
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.360]  all right, well, is this really click anywhere? Or is it like, click in the center? And it really is
[42:35.360 --> 42:40.000]  like, you can go to the top left corner. And I think I only got one bad click out of like,
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.840]  10 minutes of playing around with that trackpad.
[42:41.840 --> 42:46.640]  Dave Tilley My son was really skeptical. So he's fifth grade, and they have a bunch of Chromebooks
[42:46.640 --> 42:53.440]  at his school. And it's not because he's my son, he just is. He said all the kids hate them. Because
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.800]  all the kids have like Apple. And they all hate them. And then like the one day, it was like,
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.680]  they had like, everybody got in trouble, because a whole bunch of them got like trashed. And I was
[43:03.680 --> 43:08.720]  like, that's why you guys have Chromebooks instead of MacBooks. You're a bunch of reckless anyway.
[43:08.720 --> 43:14.880]  But all the Chromebooks they have don't click their tap trackpads, move them around, and then
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.640]  you just tap to do it. And he said that, and that's what he thought this was going to be like. And I
[43:18.640 --> 43:23.200]  said, No, I'm telling you, I was like, I haven't felt it yet. But trust me, there's no way Apple
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.360]  would ship it like that. And he was like, rolling his eyes. And he was like, I'm so glad I already
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.520]  have my trackpad that clicks. And then we got to the store. And he was, you know, he was like,
[43:31.520 --> 43:34.320]  Okay, you're right. This is nothing like the Chromebooks.
[43:34.320 --> 43:40.000]  Katie Grant Yeah, I mean, I've hated tap, like, I have tap to click on now. But I this is like,
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.760]  after seven years of being like, tap to click is horrible, and you accidentally, you know, brush
[43:45.760 --> 43:51.840]  on it, and then your cursor moves everywhere. And it just it's it's such an uncomfortable compromise.
[43:53.440 --> 44:00.880]  Especially if you like have it like I like having my trackpad very, very responsive. I like it being
[44:00.880 --> 44:05.680]  very quick. So having tap to click on it's like, oh, you move it once, and then all of a sudden
[44:05.680 --> 44:10.800]  your trackpads over here, and you're selecting some text that you never intended. I don't know,
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.960]  I like the physical buttons. I've always liked the physical buttons. And so having Apple actually be
[44:14.960 --> 44:21.440]  able to, to build something that feels like physical buttons, but uses the uses the technology
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.360]  of of the multi touch trackpad. It's really cool. Yeah.
[44:25.360 --> 44:28.720]  John Green Yeah. All right. Let me take a break. I'm still not done talking about force touch. But
[44:28.720 --> 44:37.680]  let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. And it's our good friends at foremost fo re mo s
[44:37.680 --> 44:45.120]  t. They're brand new, small batch American made clothing line for men and women each month,
[44:45.120 --> 44:51.520]  foremost designs and produces limited collections of men's and women's clothing, roughly four or
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.840]  five items per gender. Not a lot not overwhelming, underwhelming almost in terms of selection,
[44:57.840 --> 45:01.520]  you go there, you can check it out very quickly, see if you're interested. And if you are,
[45:01.520 --> 45:07.840]  you can buy it. And it's it's also an editorial publication. And they have a great interview
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.600]  series with some of the world's most inspiring creative people. And importantly, the average
[45:13.600 --> 45:20.720]  price of foremost products is under 50 bucks. So this is definitely affordable stuff. And again,
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.960]  made in America, really cool stuff. This is pure coincidence. I didn't even know they were on the
[45:24.960 --> 45:29.360]  schedule to be the sponsor today. I'm actually wearing today a sweater that I bought last month
[45:29.360 --> 45:36.240]  from them. That my wife is like, you're gonna wear that one again? I really like it. It's a nice
[45:36.240 --> 45:42.160]  sweater. So they just launched their second collection this week. Their interviews this
[45:42.160 --> 45:48.880]  month include eller Coltrane. She's the star of boyhood, which I still haven't seen, but I've
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.760]  heard is an amazing movie. Only reason I haven't seen it is I'm like saving it. Because I know I'm
[45:53.760 --> 46:01.680]  gonna love it because I'm such a big fan of Richard Linklater. Another interview he is Anna
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.560]  Margaret Holliman, independent actress, writer and film director. And this is brought to you by
[46:08.560 --> 46:15.360]  the same people who did need who sponsored the show on behalf in the past need as a curated retailer
[46:15.360 --> 46:21.840]  and publication for men. And they just launched their latest collection to featuring items to
[46:21.840 --> 46:30.240]  transition from fall into spring. talk show listeners interested in visiting foremost or

[47:10.640 --> 47:20.080]  out. I could not be happier with the stuff that I've bought from. So I think everybody's thinking
[47:20.080 --> 47:26.480]  about this. So usually the last, I would say, you know, really, pretty much since the iPhone came
[47:26.480 --> 47:34.960]  out, iOS has sort of been the leading edge platform for for new stuff. And it was, you know,
[47:34.960 --> 47:40.640]  it wasn't like, back to iPhone, it was back to the Mac when, you know, stuff like multi touch and
[47:40.640 --> 47:48.080]  things like that. But here's force touch, and iOS is last platform to the game.
[47:48.640 --> 47:54.240]  Yeah, you could argue that the watch technically led with it, but the watch isn't out yet. And the,
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.400]  I mean, I guess the MacBook isn't out yet either. But, but yeah, I'm,
[47:58.400 --> 48:04.480]  I think it's interesting because, I mean, we've heard rumors about haptic feedback coming to the
[48:04.480 --> 48:10.960]  Mac and iOS platforms for years. I want to say the first, the first patent over this thing came
[48:10.960 --> 48:17.120]  out, I want to say like three or four months after the original iPad. I remember, you know,
[48:17.120 --> 48:21.520]  looking over in a frenzy being like pressure sensitive screen, pressure sensitive screen,
[48:21.520 --> 48:29.920]  drawing, oh my gosh. But yeah, I feel like this technology has been very long in development.
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.000]  And it just, it's which the, the platform that made the most sense to launch it on,
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.120]  I think is probably, I, when I think about launching it on iOS versus launching it on the
[48:45.120 --> 48:54.400]  Mac, I feel like there's a lot more flexibility on the Mac platform, if that makes sense than iOS,
[48:54.400 --> 49:01.200]  in that iOS has so many different multi-touch controls at this point, especially when you
[49:01.200 --> 49:08.240]  translate over to the iPad, that introducing force touch on the, on the phone first being like,
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.200]  not only do you have contextual menus force touch, but we're opening this up to app developers.
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.200]  And I feel I'm like, I'm trying to think about when you would launch such a thing. It would
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.760]  probably be WWDC because, you know, you want an SDK for this and all of that. And the only real
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.680]  time to do that would have been last year during the iOS eight extravaganza explosion.
[49:30.640 --> 49:33.760]  That's actually, that's an interesting point. I haven't thought about that. So
[49:34.720 --> 49:40.240]  how do you like, so they did last year is a perfect example where they snuck into WWDC,
[49:40.240 --> 49:45.680]  not snuck, but they had a whole bunch of sessions, important sessions on
[49:47.760 --> 49:53.680]  the display sizes, you know, which really only made sense in the context of there are
[49:53.680 --> 49:59.520]  going to be some new screen sizes. Oh, yeah. But they didn't say that they, it was all sort
[49:59.520 --> 50:05.200]  of hypothetical. Like if you had a device that was bigger than an iPhone, but smaller than an iPad,
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.240]  blah, blah, blah, blah. Hypothetically. I'm not sure they could get away with that with force
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.640]  touch. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, yeah. For iOS. Well, yeah, exactly. Where they're like, oh,
[50:16.640 --> 50:25.200]  potentially this thing is coming down the line. Hint, hint, nudge, nudge. Whereas if you lead off
[50:25.200 --> 50:31.200]  with force touch of the watch and force touch in the Mac and you lead off in the spring with it,
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.640]  that gives people all of the spring, all of the summer, some of the fall to get used to
[50:37.440 --> 50:44.240]  developing properly with it. You know, we were talking about Button-a-palooza. Like it gets,
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.760]  it allows developers to kind of get all of their immediate must use this everywhere kind of out
[50:49.760 --> 50:56.320]  of their system. And it allows them to get to know the force touch technology well enough so that
[50:56.320 --> 51:02.320]  when say they come out down the line in September saying, oh, guess what? You know that iPad pro
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.800]  rumor or you know, the iPhone, the iPhone, it has force touch too now we have, we have force
[51:06.800 --> 51:13.120]  touch across all our devices and we'll release an SDK for developers to be able to build with it.
[51:13.760 --> 51:17.520]  Any developer who's already been playing around on the Mac is like, oh yeah, I know how force
[51:17.520 --> 51:22.080]  touch works. I know perfectly how I could implement this into my app. Whereas, you know,
[51:22.080 --> 51:28.240]  you try and do it the other way around. You try and launch, you know, a brand new technology
[51:30.320 --> 51:35.280]  on iOS in advance. I don't know. I lost my train of thought.
[51:35.280 --> 51:42.480]  Well, one of the things, I mean, you personally are like, I don't know, I don't even like a
[51:42.480 --> 51:46.960]  hobbyist level illustrator. You like to sketch, you like to draw. So clearly that's one of the
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.440]  things you're personally looking at this for. Absolutely.
[51:49.440 --> 51:55.360]  But it's way more interesting on iOS and especially the iPad than it is on the Mac
[51:55.360 --> 52:00.480]  for drawing because drawing on a trackpad is always going to have, no matter how sensitive
[52:00.480 --> 52:07.040]  the trackpad is, there's that layer of indirection where you're drawing on this thing that doesn't
[52:07.040 --> 52:11.280]  show what you're drawing and you're looking above it on a display where it shows what you're
[52:11.280 --> 52:15.120]  drawing. Whereas drawing on an iPad, it's right there.
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.040]  It's drawing directly on the screen. Yeah. It's the contrast between anybody who's ever
[52:19.040 --> 52:27.600]  used a Wacom tablet. It's the difference between an Intuos 2, you know, just sketching on this
[52:27.600 --> 52:34.160]  on the static surface and having it reflect on the screen versus like a Cintiq, which is a monitor.
[52:34.160 --> 52:39.280]  So actually having it directly under. When the Force Touch first came out, I got really excited
[52:39.280 --> 52:43.520]  and I wrote an article and I'm more about, you know, what does this mean for the rumored iPad
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.480]  Pro and what does this mean for iPads in general? And someone was like, you can't use Force Touch
[52:48.480 --> 52:54.560]  on a multi-touch screen with pixels. It's going to damage the pixels. And I got a really good
[52:54.560 --> 53:01.600]  laugh out of that because I'm like, technically a MacBook trackpad is a, oop, there went my phone.
[53:03.440 --> 53:09.280]  It's fine. It's in a case. The MacBook trackpad is a multi-touch screen, essentially. There just,
[53:09.280 --> 53:12.720]  there are no pixels underneath it. And again, the glass doesn't move.
[53:12.720 --> 53:14.240]  It is glass. Yeah.
[53:14.240 --> 53:19.600]  I mean, I'm sure it's engineering wise trickier because you've also got a display, but it's.
[53:19.600 --> 53:26.800]  Sure. You've got to map your input to specific pixels on the screen, which is also, I mean,
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.240]  that's something, speaking from putting my illustrator hat on for a second, that's something
[53:32.240 --> 53:38.960]  that illustrators and stylus makers have struggled with a lot with the iPad because the iPad's
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.600]  initial touch targets were very much built for finger sized input. So it's also why you saw
[53:45.600 --> 53:52.800]  like styluses with these big round sort of rubbery nibs the first couple of years. And also why,
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.320]  if you have an iPad Air 2 and a stylus, all of a sudden the stylus like is cruddy. It doesn't work
[53:58.320 --> 54:03.360]  very well anymore because between the iPad Air and the iPad Air 2, they like completely changed
[54:03.360 --> 54:10.000]  how finger input was done. So from a finger point, it doesn't feel like anything, but from a stylus,
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.440]  all of a sudden, like, oh, the pixels are off mapped and everything's off center. And sometimes
[54:15.440 --> 54:20.720]  you won't even like, it doesn't even connect. Like it's a bunch of gibberish, which anyway,
[54:20.720 --> 54:29.920]  like the point of that is just that actually having mapped pixels to pressure sensitivity
[54:29.920 --> 54:36.400]  and a pressure sensitive screen would be huge for artists. And like, I just, I, you know,
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.240]  I dick around. I sketch sometimes. I'm not, you know, I'm not a heavy duty illustrator,
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.560]  but I talk to like, I have friends who are cartoonists and web cartoonists who, you know,
[54:44.560 --> 54:49.520]  who have been wanting a pressure sensitive iPad screen for years, because the idea,
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.960]  especially with something like Handoff, the idea of being able to start a sketch on your iPad and
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.360]  have the same amount of control and precision as you do, you know, working on a, on a Wacom Cintiq,
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.480]  it's, it's a pipe dream. It's a, it's like that, that is the thing that, that artists want.
[55:07.120 --> 55:15.520]  Yeah. And I think that it's only natural that the smarts go into the drawing surface and not
[55:15.520 --> 55:21.680]  the stylus, you know, and the only way to get any kind of pressure sensitivity up until now on iOS
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.920]  is to use some kind of pressure sensitive stylus. And it's just, I just feel like that's not right.
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.400]  And it's, you know, it even hearkens back to the analog days where the pressure is registered on
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.640]  paper. It's the pen isn't smart about it. You know, it's the paper that absorbs the pressure
[55:34.640 --> 55:38.800]  if you're going to do a hard stroke versus a light stroke. Yeah, absolutely. And actually,
[55:38.800 --> 55:44.720]  that's something going back to like force touch and haptics. That's one of the things that got me
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.120]  super excited is not just that the, that the screen is recognizing your pressure and whether
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.560]  you're, you're making a little, a light thin line or a dark thick line based on your pressure.
[55:54.560 --> 56:00.960]  But if the haptics can, if the haptics can provide click feedback, it's a possibility that they can
[56:00.960 --> 56:05.200]  provide a little bit of rumbling feedback while you're drawing too, to give you a little bit more,
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.760]  or at least feel like you're getting a little bit more resistance, which I don't know if you've
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.160]  ever tried drawing on an iPad screen, but one of my biggest criticisms has always been the fact
[56:14.160 --> 56:18.480]  that like, if you're drawing with anything fine tipped, or even if, you know, even with a rubber
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.520]  stylus or one of those paint brush styluses, it feels like you're drawing on glass. There's no,
[56:23.520 --> 56:29.440]  there's, there's no pretending that like even on a Wacom tablet, it feels like you're drawing on
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.520]  glass or on plastic. It doesn't feel like paper. And like if haptics could do that, even, even to
[56:35.520 --> 56:40.960]  like 50% of what paper feels like, that could be really incredible, right? Like that, that's a
[56:40.960 --> 56:49.200]  completely different experience that we're feeling with what's otherwise a stationary glass surface.
[56:49.200 --> 56:55.120]  Yeah. So the things that come to mind for me for the future of this haptic engine going across
[56:55.120 --> 57:01.600]  everything Apple does for iOS, it artists, definitely. It also really makes me think about
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.120]  like, you know, like you brought up the rumored, you know, mythical iPad Pro, you know, which
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.200]  obviously is not coming out the spring. Maybe now if people are thinking, maybe that's part of the
[57:11.200 --> 57:16.960]  big fall, you know, stuff this year. I, you know, everybody's been saying that for a long time,
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.280]  and there've been rumors that Apple's, you know, commissioning screens and stuff like that. But
[57:21.280 --> 57:26.240]  then it's, I've always thought, well, who's the market, right? And artists would definitely be
[57:26.240 --> 57:33.120]  one, right? Like, I think, you know, no question. Yeah, no question. So I think that's got to be,
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.200]  you know, if if that device exists, that has to be part of it. I think,
[57:37.200 --> 57:42.800]  I feel like the iPad Pro market, the only way they're going to like, Apple has developed machines
[57:42.800 --> 57:49.840]  that are primarily designed for the creative area before, which is to say, like the the Mac Pro is
[57:49.840 --> 57:56.560]  for for a long time, was designed for software engineers and filmmakers and, you know, people
[57:56.560 --> 58:02.000]  who are doing high level video intensive work. But, you know, people have argued, well, Apple
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  doesn't really care about creatives anymore. And I don't necessarily think that's true. But I think
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.600]  their their viewpoint has broadened a little bit. And I kind of feel like for the iPad Pro to be
[58:11.600 --> 58:18.240]  successful, it has to aggressively target business in a way. And, again, from a from an artist's
[58:18.240 --> 58:22.160]  perspective, I see force touch being very useful because of the haptics because the pressure all of
[58:22.160 --> 58:29.600]  that. But from a business perspective, the thing that kind of caught my attention when we were
[58:29.600 --> 58:37.280]  talking about bigger screens and also haptic responses, digital keyboards, the idea like we've
[58:37.280 --> 58:41.920]  seen really, really crappy implementations of this and in BlackBerry a couple years ago when they
[58:41.920 --> 58:47.280]  actually, you know, they made the screen click for I think the BlackBerry Storm and the Storm 2 had
[58:47.280 --> 58:52.800]  electromagnetic responses, but it just didn't feel very good. And it was really, really sketchy,
[58:52.800 --> 58:57.680]  didn't didn't quite work when you're tapping on it. But if you had an iPad Pro, say that was,
[58:57.680 --> 59:04.000]  I don't know, 12, 13 inches, and you had haptics available for drawing programs, but then you pull
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.360]  up the keyboard. And when you're typing, you get the feeling that you're physically depressing keys.
[59:10.560 --> 59:17.920]  And you would you get the feeling of like, being on a key versus typing in between a key. I feel
[59:17.920 --> 59:24.000]  like that could potentially be a game changer for the iPad in regards to writing and functioning
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.760]  with it. Yeah, I thought of that too. I think that would even in theory, I could see how that would
[59:27.760 --> 59:34.240]  even help on the phone. Oh, yeah. But the big but is that it seems like you'd only get that feedback
[59:35.440 --> 59:41.200]  after pressing. Yeah, so it's more it's not like you'd know, I don't see how they could do it
[59:41.200 --> 59:46.640]  unless they could actually raise the screen in advance, which doesn't seem like that technology
[59:46.640 --> 59:52.080]  exists yet, especially if you're talking, you know, at the same time, about Apple's desire to
[59:52.080 --> 59:57.440]  move from glass to sapphire, which is hard, like you can't can't make sapphire raise up in a bubble
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.120]  on the fly. Some substance could and you know, but you wouldn't get that feedback before you press
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.840]  you'd only get it afterwards, it would just be a way to know that maybe you just you thought you
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.960]  were typing a D but ooh, it feels like I got the D and the F at the same time. Yeah, the other
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.080]  thought is you use the pressure sensitivity to be that when you lightly brush your fingers against
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.520]  the keyboard, it doesn't actually type down, it just lets you feel what those keys and then when
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.560]  you press a little bit harder, it types for you. Yeah, that might be a little bit of a or might be
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.560]  too much of an adjustment to do on an iPad. But I like the idea, especially I was actually thinking
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.520]  about it after I got a chance to type on the new MacBook going back to that for a second. Because
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.400]  the the new MacBooks keys, I mean, they talked a lot about the the butterfly design and all of
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.080]  that. But the keys are significantly shorter and thinner than they are even on the current MacBook
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.640]  Air. And initially, it took a second for me to kind of get used to it because it I was really
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.760]  like hammering down on the keys, because it's what I've I'm used to with the air and like the even
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:12.880]  the older the older key keyboards with like really thick manual keys. But with the MacBook, after a
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.320]  little bit of like tinkering with it, like feeling it out, I found that I was almost gliding around
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.240]  the gliding around the the the keyboard when I was typing. So it didn't, you know, it wasn't like
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.280]  physically picking my finger up tapping another thing physically, da da da da, but it was moving
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:36.160]  my fingers very quickly. And only pressing down when I felt kind of like the ridges onto a certain
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.240]  key. I just like, I don't know if that makes any sense. But it feels to me like the new MacBook
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:51.440]  keyboard is practically a like a force touch trackpad. It's it's so small and so thin that it
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.960]  like, I don't know it. It feels like that that is potentially down the line where Apple could go.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.160]  Yeah, keyboards. It, it makes me think I won't like it, because I feel like but on the other
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.840]  hand, I've never liked typing on any laptop keyboard ever made. It's all just a degree of how
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:15.280]  how little I like it compared to a real solid clicky desktop keyboard. It's intriguing to me,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.160]  though I do and I love that slow motion video they made of the fingers, you know, making the
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.560]  whole thing go the wobble of the keyboard. Yeah. Well, I would call it like not a thinness, but
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.640]  like a shallowness. That's the main thing. Yeah, doesn't it just there's not that there's just
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.560]  inner physically isn't the room to press down. I just sent you a link. And this is way before
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:41.040]  your time. This is Oh, no, I know. I know the re 400 re 400. Yeah. I remember wanting one. So I
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:47.040]  wanted every computer. I wanted one of everything and I got none of them. But I remember when this
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.280]  came out, and they had demo units at like, I think it was Kmart, one of the stores had,
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.960]  and there was the Atari 802, the 800 had a real keyboard. I'll put this in the show notes,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.440]  the Atari 400, which had I don't even know what you would call that. What would you call that?
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.680]  That word? I feel like that was a touch type keyboard before touch type was a thing on on
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.120]  Macs where it's just like it's a it's a mat with slightly raised indents for where keys should be.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:17.040]  But there's there like little like little tiny buttons hidden underneath the keys,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.360]  but not even buttons. They're like dimples. Right? It was so bad. And I remember all of my friends,
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.840]  even though you know, I was the one the weird one who was obsessed with keyboard clickiness,
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.160]  even at that age, and nobody else really cared. But everybody agreed, my God, this computer's
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.080]  keyboard is the biggest piece of crap ever. Like, this is insane. I think it was like a classic.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.280]  I'm guessing internally at Apple, it was like a classic upsell where the Atari 400 really only
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.120]  existed to get people to buy the Atari 800. Oh, yeah. Where it's like, sure, you could you could
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.080]  have this or for x amount of dollars more, you could have a real keyboard. You want a real
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.320]  keyboard, don't you? It was so they advertised it as an advanced child proof design featuring
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.000]  a pressure sensitive wipe clean keyboard. Well, I mean, I guess it would be a lot harder to spill
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.560]  applesauce on it. I don't know. I mean, I feel like spilling something on any computer in the
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.920]  80s was bad news, period. Yeah, but that's, you know, I think the new MacBook keyboard can beat
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.200]  that one. Yeah, well, so I like I completely understand your hesitation on it, because I was
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.800]  deaf like I don't, I'm not a huge fan of the laptop keyboards, especially the increasing
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:36.480]  obsession with thinner and shallower keyboards. But you need it for for a computer that's so thin
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:45.200]  that it makes the current MacBook Airs look like, you know, giants. But I like I genuinely really,
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.240]  really enjoyed typing on it. And I don't know if it's just I physically noticed the wobble of the
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:57.600]  keys after using that MacBook, like going back to my MacBook Air. But there is something significantly
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.880]  faster feeling about typing on it. Once you get used to it, the first five minutes, it feels like
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.400]  you're typing in bizarro land, or almost like you're typing on glass, where it's your because I
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.440]  like when I first started using it, I was pounding so hard that I was making the entire computer
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.920]  shake. And I was I was really kind of surprised by that. Because I'm like, I don't feel like I'm
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.720]  typing that much harder than I do on my air. And then once I sort of lightened up my pressure on
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.680]  it, I was able to go really fast. That's how I type on every device. Yeah, it's like bam, bam,
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.720]  bam, bam, but no, it's I don't know what it was just a really quick learning curve.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:40.240]  And I really, I really enjoyed it. I to the point where I'm now that I'm using my Mac, but you know,
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:46.720]  going back to using my 11 inch MacBook Air. I'm kind of jealous. I really want to use that
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.040]  keyboard. Not enough to get a new MacBook, but but enough that I'm like, all right,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.840]  can it be next year already? I would, I would like to see this evolve into the other computers.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.120]  So this brings us back full circle to where we were half an hour ago talking about the
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.480]  a week later, how people seem more upset about the new MacBook than they were on the day of the
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.000]  event. Like as it settled in, people are upset. And one of the things I've detected a recurring
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.400]  complaint is that clearly what people wanted were the MacBook Air as we know it with a retina
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.880]  screen. Oh, yeah, they're not going to get and because I think they know in their heart, this
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:29.840]  means they're never going to get it that as prices drop on the components for this new MacBook,
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.440]  and it can once they can make it for like 999 I don't know if they'll get it if they'll do it all
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.760]  the maybe they'll keep the 11 inch air around longer at 899 or something but once they can
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:46.320]  make this 999 the MacBook Air goes away. Yeah, I have to assume so which makes me a little bummed
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.480]  to be honest, I really liked the 11 inch computer, but the 12 inch is not that much bigger. Honestly,
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:59.120]  it's it's not that much. It's not like it you have a little bit of width here and there. But overall,
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:05.520]  it has very similarly the same footprint. Yeah, it's a funny sort of way that like, they've
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.280]  they've expanded a lot of other things. Now there's two iPad sizes. Now there's three iPhone
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:18.400]  sizes. And at least two at the you know, current, you know, the latest and greatest. But now they're
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.200]  taking the standard MacBook from two sizes to one size, sort of splitting the difference.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.160]  Yeah, bringing it down to all right, the air is if you want the light model, you're just going to
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.000]  have to make do with 12 inches. And if you want more screen size variation, then let's look at the
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.560]  promo the pro line. Yeah, I think that's definitely it. But I think that it's as that settled in,
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:46.160]  people realize they're never going to get an air as we know it, where okay, we're going to sacrifice
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.400]  a little, you know, it's not going to be the thinnest in the world. But it has, you know,
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:56.880]  a separate power port, it has magsafe, it has a couple of USB ports, has a thunderbolt, this,
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:04.640]  you know, dongle. Not a dongle port port. Yeah. Because it dongle is what you want to avoid.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.120]  And it's just not going to happen. And I guess people as I'd settled in now people are getting
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.480]  people are getting angry. But I still think though, like, but look at how different it is
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:23.600]  where in 2008, when Apple unveiled the air, no one wanted an air, it was $3100 to get the good one.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.760]  And now you can get a good new MacBook for 1300. The base model is actually pretty good.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.000]  Yeah, it's not bad at all. I got, you know, my most recent air is $1400 something like
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.240]  that for a completely maxed out. And I loved it. It was a it was a great choice.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.160]  Yeah. And I the other thing I feel like people cannot get through their head is the way that
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.520]  Apple is clearly saying, you're not supposed to work with a power connection. You're, you know,
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.240]  you're, you know, the future is not just wireless peripherals. But wireless power, you know,
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.600]  that you're you're going to charge when you're, you know, at somewhere like overnight, and then
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.880]  you're going to use the thing all day without having it plugged in. You're just going to run
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.400]  with it. Yeah. And you know what, I was actually my one concern with the new MacBook was the
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.560]  lack of magsafe. Especially I don't know if you saw on Twitter, but yesterday I had a fun accident
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.600]  with my MacBook Air where it flew like six feet out of a backpack. Yeah. So I picked up my backpack
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.320]  and it wasn't zipped all the way and as I like picked it up to swing it around on to my back,
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.680]  my MacBook Air flew out of the back out of the backpack and like slammed onto the ground and
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.760]  it's fine except for corner dent because SSDs are magical things. Wow. Yeah. And and like thick
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:50.320]  bezels, thank God for not edge to edge glass, glass screens. But that said, like, I, as soon
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.080]  as that happened, and I was like, after I got over the heart attack, and they're like, Oh, my God,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:00.080]  my MacBook's okay. I immediately thought of Oh, God, this is what's going to happen to 100 MacBooks
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.040]  when someone trips over the USB C cord, because they're just they're just going to go flying
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:12.640]  through the air, aren't they? And that, like, I'm kind of concerned still about the USB C being the
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.880]  power charging solution. But it's like you said, I really think that by taking away magsafe, Apple
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.840]  is basically saying, Yo, you don't need to charge this computer, you know, 910 hours of battery
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.600]  life, that should be good enough for anyone using this. And for me, I'm like, that's right on the
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.840]  edge, I feel like I would have been a lot more comfortable if they had released a machine that
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:42.240]  was like 14 to 16 hours of battery life, light web browsing, because 14 to 16 hours translates
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.000]  probably into seven to eight hours of like heavy usage or running multiple programs or, you know,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.200]  watching video, Safari tabs open exactly, you know, basically how any how any, you know, moderate to
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:02.480]  pro user destroys their travel machine. So nine to 10 hours makes me a little bit nervous, especially
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.240]  so during the keynote, I had a I had my 11 inch MacBook Air, which has the same, you know, this is
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:15.040]  last year's model has the same reported nine to 10 hours as the new MacBook. And I had it tethered
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:23.360]  to a to a Canon route or a mark to shooting the keynote and the battery went from 100% fully
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:31.280]  charged to 19% in an hour and 20 minutes with that tethering. And I ended up having to take out the
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.760]  take off the tethering and turn my screen down really low and just spend the rest of the the
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.880]  keynote like, all right, I'm just gonna I'm gonna write color, no more photographs. So I think about
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:47.920]  things like that, where I'm like, yes, this is not, this is not the ideal use case for this for
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:56.880]  this new MacBook. But still, you know, it should probably last more than two hours in high usage
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.040]  scenarios without needing to be plugged in. And for people, like maybe maybe Apple's just saying,
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.160]  those those people, you know, people who need high usage, high battery things, maybe maybe you should
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.640]  still look at a computer that has a mag safe, right? For now? Yeah, for you know, and it's,
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.080]  I'm not trying to say that it's not a loss, because I like almost everybody. I don't know
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.360]  if there's anybody who hasn't had one incident over the last the mag safe era where somebody
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.000]  tripped over a cable and mag safe just popped, you know, as advertised popped right out. And you're
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  like, wow, that mag safe just might have saved my computer. It's happened to me. So I'm not
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.920]  underplaying it. I definitely think that not having mag safe is in some ways, it's a loss,
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.680]  because mag safe is amazing. And what a clever idea and nobody else has it. Low these many
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:54.240]  years later, surprisingly, but I really think that the message is, you shouldn't be using it
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.120]  while it's powering, or at least while it's connected to a wall outlet. And so think about
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.640]  it. And when this when when Mark Gurman's scoop on this design hit a couple, I think it was in
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  January. Yes. And everybody, you know, the the first thing everybody said, Well, this is this
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.320]  has to be wrong, because there's no mag safe, and there's no way they're gonna get rid of mag safe.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:22.000]  And then the people who obviously had the right idea were like, well, iPad doesn't have mag safe,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:30.320]  and an awful lot of people use their iPad the way other people use a MacBook. And you think about
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.000]  that, and then you also think, well, then what do you do with an iPad, if you're using it all day,
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.280]  you know, as a writer, as a student as whatever, and you're low on power? Well, you don't plug it
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.200]  in a wall, you use like a Mophie battery pack and plug it in. So and you're going to be able to do
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:54.240]  that with the MacBook. Mophie MacBook case? Well, I don't know about a case. Yeah, but no, I'm
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.800]  totally like I, people were what was it last week, people were like, Oh, Apple is going to allow
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.360]  people to make battery cases for the MacBook. And I'm like, it's, it's standard. It's USB C.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.480]  This is the first time like this is this is a charging port that they they don't control or own.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.400]  So I, I kind of feel the power user move is not going to be to bring your your charging cable
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.480]  along with you with your USB only MacBook, but the power user move is to bring a you know,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.600]  high capacity Mophie style power brick with you and then you have it then you don't need MagSafe
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.280]  because it'll just be sitting there right next to your MacBook on the table with a you know,
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:43.280]  six inch USB cable. Yeah, I was actually you know, the person the person who is going to make bank
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:50.480]  on the USB C accessories is who's going to make a hub a USB C hub that also has like a 10,000
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.680]  milliamp battery in it. Oh, yeah, wouldn't that be great? Like you plug your USB C
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.000]  into something like the size of a current Apple power brick, maybe a little bit longer.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.080]  And then out of that you get a 10,000 milliamp battery, you get your DisplayPort hub, you get
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.400]  USB ports, that that would be a that would be a killer, killer accessory for me. Charge a couple
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:19.040]  of 100 bucks. I'm looking at my Mophie. It's old. There's a new one now with it's much more clever,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.280]  but I have this couple of years old Mophie juice back power station. And now I'm just looking at
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.120]  it thinking like, well, look at all these sides, they could just fill it with USB ports. That'd be
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.840]  great. Mm hmm. Yeah, it's like if Apple can, you know, still fill ports while filling its laptops
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:39.120]  full of batteries, a battery manufacturer should totally be able to do that. No problem. That's
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.640]  definitely I think that's the power user move going forward is to treat it exactly like you
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.400]  would an iOS device, where you know the if you expect to be running low on battery by the end
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.360]  of the day, don't assume that you're going to find a seat next to a wall outlet. Bring a battery pack
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:07.040]  along. Oh, yeah, bring it. You know, I'm trying to find this article right now. Chris says name,
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:13.840]  Chris. Christopher Finn wrote a really nice sort of eulogy for the PowerBook duo on Mac worlds a
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.920]  couple days ago, he's been doing this like, old tech column, like, celebrating the history of
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.560]  past Apple devices. And I was thinking about like, the PowerBook duo was my first laptop,
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.280]  and I love it very, very fondly. I was thinking about man, you know, again, with the with the
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.800]  cool idea of like, the MacBook is probably underpowered right now. But you know, if people
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:40.480]  want to want to take it to the next level, wouldn't it be cool if there was a, you know, PowerBook duo
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.080]  doc style thing for the new MacBook where it's like, you plug it in, and then all of a sudden,
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.880]  you've got all these ports, and you've got a super huge retina monitor, and everything's magical.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.480]  And maybe not app, maybe Apple is not the person to make the fancy retina, you know, retina display
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.960]  adaptation for the for the MacBook, but I'm sure somebody might, right?
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.400]  Yeah, I don't know. But I've got Christopher's article, I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.240]  It was a cool machine.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.920]  Yeah, it was. I mostly liked it because it was not a ThinkPad. I'll be honest.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.320]  God, look at the bezel around that display.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.080]  I know. That's a beautiful, beautiful, what, five pounds? I want to say.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.280]  Are those volume buttons on the right?
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.000]  It had bezels.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  No, no, no, that's that. Those were the screen brightness.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.640]  Oh, all right.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.800]  That's right. Because you, my trick was always like, turn the screen brightness down really
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.160]  low and then switch from 256 colors to black and white. So you can get like an extra hour
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:42.320]  of playing Escape Velocity Nova. I think I got like four hours out of that battery once
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.480]  by like keeping it on the lowest settings.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.640]  Oh, God.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.320]  Anything that docked was always clever. Look at how thick those keys were, though.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.800]  I know. That keyboard was so fun.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.040]  Oh, my God. And it had little props. I forgot about that. I forgot about the little feet
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.440]  Little feet to prop the keyboard up. I think that was before we understood the ergonomics
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.880]  of propping up keys. Pleased to type with our palms up.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.280]  Completely ruining our wrists. Yeah. The removable battery packs.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.680]  That's amazing. All right. I got to link it up. I can't. I'm tempted to just read it right now.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.160]  Yeah. Well, an educated reading on the air with John Gruber of the PowerBook Duo.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.920]  Anything with a dock, though. It always sounded like a great idea and never actually took off.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:34.000]  Yeah. Unfortunate. I see. I feel like in the handoff era, that would be so cool.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.160]  Where you're just like, even even you just plug your USB-C MacBook in.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.360]  Oh, I guess it does this all wirelessly at this point. You know, I, I don't have to plug
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.640]  anything like I don't have to plug my MacBook into my iMac because all of the things here
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:54.080]  I can mostly get on my computer via handoff or I can get everything from Dropbox directly.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.000]  Like I don't keep any files on my MacBook Air. My MacBook Air has like a tiny little
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.880]  SSD, like a 128 SSD. And then everything I just store in Dropbox and I just grab what I want.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.280]  And then do you have your, you have the air set up not to, not to mirror your entire Dropbox?
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.120]  It's selective sync. So I have like my work files and then occasionally I'll pull over,
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.200]  like if I'm working on a music project or a roller derby stuff, I have like
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.000]  that specific folder synced, but everything else is just, if I need it, I'll download it somewhere
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.200]  else. Yeah, that's the killer. That was like the level up for Dropbox that made it like
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.400]  infrastructure. Oh yeah. It's because then you could use it on in scenarios like that where you
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.440]  can't mirror it all. And on conversely, you can then use it in other scenarios. Like if you have a
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.960]  big, big iMac on your desk and all of your photos are, you know, it's like a humongous, you know,
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.600]  terabyte collection of photos. You can put them on Dropbox and not worry about what it's going to do
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.080]  to your SSD in your MacBook. Oh yeah. You don't, you don't want to cry. I'm, I think I moved all
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.440]  of my photos to Dropbox last year after they acquired Loom, which was my sort of go-to cloud
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.360]  photo solution. And I, I'm not crazy about Dropbox carousel cause it's kind of, it's kind of wonky
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.840]  and it's kind of broken right now, but it does allow you to very quickly like go to years and
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.520]  dates and stuff. And just knowing that all of my photos are backed up and away somewhere. And then
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.880]  also locally onto my iMac. So I'm like, all right. I like, I don't have to panic about losing five
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.920]  years of photos because hard drives start clicking or SSDs explode or I don't, I don't know what
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:29.440]  SSDs do when they die. They just turn off. Yeah. I think they just go corrupt. I think it's like,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:35.840]  they just turn to static. I don't know. I've never had one go bad, but. Nor have I. Yeah. I think,
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:41.120]  I think it's just like a, just like a state of corruption, but they don't click. No, they
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.920]  certainly don't click. I never have to hear that sound again. Knock on wood. Let me take another
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.240]  break here. And I want to keep talking about photos. And I want to talk, thank our next
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:57.760]  sponsor. It's our good friends at Harry's. Harry's makes a high quality shaving products for men.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.240]  You name it, if it's related to shaving, Harry's does it. They have their own razors that they
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.600]  design really nice, nice heft, nice design, not blinging, just feels like a nice thing in your
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.760]  hand. They make their own blades. They don't like white label blades from some unnamed place. They
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:22.000]  went and bought like a hundred year old razor blade factory in Germany and make their own
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.200]  super high quality razor blades, cut out the middleman, sell them right to you.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:32.960]  Their stuff, their blades, their refills and stuff like that are as good as anybody else's and about
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.680]  half the price of the stuff that you can get from like Gillette or Schick. Just go to Amazon and
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:45.920]  compare the prices that Amazon has, famously low prices for Gillette fusion refills or whatever,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.520]  and then compare them to Harry's and you'll see it's literally about half the price.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:56.240]  A fantastic deal. They've got shaving cream, shaving gel, aftershave, anything, you name it,
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.480]  they have it. And they're coming out with new designs. You can go there. If you haven't checked
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.000]  out their website in a while, go there and check out some of the new designs that they have.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.440]  A really cool stuff. It's, you know, why should, it's just a pure internet play,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:16.640]  cut out the middleman. Don't worry about selling stuff in retail stores. Just they sell direct to
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:22.880]  you and pass the savings along. I don't know how else to put it. I'm a really happy customer.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:28.080]  I've been using them for, I don't know, at least over a year. Great stuff. And it's just so
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.760]  convenient that you never have to worry about it. You just wait till you're getting low on blades
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:38.240]  and then go to their website and 30 seconds later you've got a package on the way. Couldn't be
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.440]  easier. Where do you go to find out more? Go to their website, harrys.com. Check it out. Look for
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.800]  stuff. When you order, if you're a first time customer, use this code, talk show, know the,
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:57.440]  just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W and you'll save five bucks on your first order. So five bucks doesn't sound
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.400]  like a lot, but their starter kit is only like 15 bucks. 15 bucks gets you everything you need
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.000]  to get started. A razor, a pack of blades. And so you can use that code, get it for 10 bucks.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.920]  It's an amazing deal. Way more than $10 of value. So go there, check it out and remember that code,
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.120]  talk show. It'll save you five bucks and it'll let people know you came from the show. So my
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:26.640]  thanks to Harry's for once again supporting this show. A while back, I've been meaning to talk to
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.280]  you about this forever, Serenity. You had a story. This is all the way back at Macworld. You did a
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:39.920]  story on the Lightroom for iPad. So I don't get it. I've been a Lightroom user for years
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:45.360]  and I've just, it's like I'm starting to turn into an old man who's afraid to use new stuff.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:51.680]  I like Lightroom. I've been using it since 1.0. It was like I tried Aperture and I tried Lightroom
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.640]  and at least back then Aperture was really slow and Lightroom was really fast. And I was like,
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:01.200]  I'll go with this. And I've been the Lightroom user ever since. I don't get the iPad version.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:10.640]  Yeah, I feel like it's something that you have to actively insert into your workflow.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.960]  Some things you just, they work seamlessly with you. Pixelmator is a great example of
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:26.400]  similarly an app that's both available on the Mac and on iOS. And I felt that it was like,
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.760]  it was really simple in Pixelmator. You just do this and then Handoff does that magical.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:40.720]  Lightroom for iPad, I feel like it took me a good month to really feel comfortable with it
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.000]  and to really get used to it. Like Jeff Carlson wrote our hands-on I think for Macworld when it
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.960]  first came out. And he kind of encouraged me to start using it. And I have to admit,
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.640]  I still don't use it all the time. And I'm still going between Aperture and Lightroom also,
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.840]  to be honest, because Aperture has better tethering workflow for me in part because Jason Snell was,
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.000]  he wrote a bunch of Apple scripts for it. But I don't know.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.160]  Tethering meaning that you're shooting.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.840]  Shooting live. So like tether, yeah, exactly. There's so many meanings of tethering nowadays.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.000]  Tethering, yeah. You're connecting your camera via USB to your Mac so that anything that you take
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.240]  is showing up immediately on your Mac rather than having to take it and offload and put back in
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:38.560]  into a via SD card. I don't know. I feel like the app is really, really useful for kind of seeing
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:46.160]  your library and for editing, doing light edits. But it again, like a lot of these is dependent
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.640]  on your internet connection and dependent on the closeness of your Lightroom library,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:26:00.400]  where I don't feel like you could do everything that I might want to do on Lightroom for the iPad
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:11.920]  versus on Lightroom for my Mac. I feel like I like the iPad a lot better as a photo editing platform.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:20.640]  I really like being able to physically highlight areas with my finger and physically be able to
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.880]  color things in or change dials by sliding. Multi-touch gestures feel like a more
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.560]  natural editing experience because I feel more tactile than just pointing and clicking. But
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:43.920]  I also don't necessarily think that Lightroom for iPad is the best way to do it yet. It makes me
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.840]  question in sort of a broader example, I don't know if this is where you're going with this,
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:53.280]  but it makes me sort of question the just companies in general being like,
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.160]  well, we have a Mac app, we have to be on the iPad. And we have to have something on the iPad
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:03.360]  that links to our Mac app. And some people do this really well. And I think Lightroom is a
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.440]  decent example of a good adaptation and a good linkage to its Mac app. But with other ones,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.440]  it feels kind of throwaway. It feels like the company is just like, we need to have a presence
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.520]  on here. Actually, some of Adobe's other apps are really good examples of that, where a couple of
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:28.000]  a couple of their like Photoshop, Photoshop Express for the iPhone. I remember being really excited
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  when that first came out being like, yes, finally, I'll be able to have a good way to edit photos,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.160]  like it was two or three years ago. And then when I opened it, I'm like, this does nothing.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  This does absolutely nothing that I want it to do. Yeah, my perspective is as like a decided,
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.840]  prosumer is probably the wrong way to put it because it puts the word pro before
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:55.200]  consumer. It's more like a consumer with occasional pro dabbling consfessional.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.320]  But, you know, like, I'm into photography enough that I, I still like to buy real cameras,
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.080]  I don't just shoot everything on my iPhone, and I, you know, and I'll spend $1,000 I have a,
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.360]  you know, I have a Canon 5D, it's years old now, the mark two, but I have like a nice,
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.480]  the 50 millimeter f2 f 1.2 lens, which was I don't think it was like 1500 bucks.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.480]  So last forever. All right, the glass definitely last. But you know, I have a couple $1,000 of
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.880]  cameras, which is nothing compared to a serious photographer, but it's a lot more than most
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:33.520]  people. Which, which where, you know, where should I be editing my photos has been a dilemma
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:41.600]  forever. And I photo was never right for me. And Lightroom at first really hit a sweet spot. But
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:49.200]  the the, the problem I've run into with Lightroom is just that it ties my photos to my Mac. And
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:58.160]  they're not everywhere. And picture life doesn't really I haven't really they have a new thing for
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.400]  Lightroom. But it's like, because I shoot in raw, and the lot of the photo upload sites want
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.600]  everything in JPEG, you have to Yeah, you have to like export manually, which is way too much work,
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.200]  like, I'm not going to do that. I just kind of, you know, I don't spend that much time,
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.600]  I just go through throw out all the ones that are garbage, keep the ones that aren't garbage,
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.080]  find the ones that are actually really good, and then maybe spend a couple minutes, you know,
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.080]  tweaking them to make them perfect. You know, so there's really like, I'll shoot, you know,
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:34.640]  like a over a holiday or a vacation, I'll shoot like 300 photos, I'll throw 100 out, maybe 150
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.440]  out, because they're garbage or duplicates, you know, equally good as another shot taken at the
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:44.000]  same moment. And I'll find maybe a dozen that are really good. And then I'll take those dozen and,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.520]  you know, apply filters and tweak the exposure to make it perfect. And then that's it. That's
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.120]  all I do. And then I'm done. I don't want to sit there and like have to pick which ones to export
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.680]  and stuff like that. So I'm hopeful, I guess where I'm going with this whole thing is that I'm kind
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:04.000]  of secretly hoping that the new photos for Mac will be good enough for all of that, that it'll
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.880]  make me want to switch from Lightroom, even if I miss some of Lightroom's expert controls,
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:15.600]  that the overall flow of having my photos, sync to iCloud, and then I, you know, all I have to do is
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:21.680]  star them. And then the starred ones will show up on all my devices and stuff like that. It's kind
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:29.200]  of what I'm hoping. Yeah, I so I've been testing the photos beta since I think the first first
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.440]  developer beta on the phone and the first developer beta on the Mac, which was last
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:44.000]  month I want to say now. And photos isn't perfect. But it feels so I used Loom last two years ago
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.320]  when it when it showed up. I want to say it started in 2013. And then Dropbox bought it last
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.400]  year. And I really liked Loom for exactly the reason that you were describing where it's like
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.320]  your photos are everywhere, although Loom didn't have photo editing features. So anytime I wanted
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.280]  to edit something, I had to pull it down and edit it in like Photoshop or something and then throw
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.880]  it back up. And that was that was that was messy. It didn't have the seamless experience that I
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:13.440]  really wanted. And photos comes closest, I think, especially like talking about what what you really
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:21.200]  want out of a photo editor. The thing that really, like that really impresses me in photos is how
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:28.720]  easy it is to get a really nice edit from it. Where like their editing controls are super simple.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:33.360]  If you want them to be super simple, it's just you know, it's three sliders. It's like the,
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.320]  the light, the color and the black and white slider if you want to tint your photo into black
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.200]  and white. But there's a lot of there's a lot of hidden stuff in there. If you drop it down,
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.360]  like if you drop down the light exposure, you've got exposure, highlights, shadows, brightness,
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.280]  contrast, stuff like that. And on photos for Mac, there's even some more stuff that you can
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.400]  add like a histogram if you want, you know, more in depth about what your colors doing.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:05.200]  You can add like sharpening and definition and noise reduction and white balance and levels. So
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.560]  you got you got a lot of controls there. Which is not I mean, it's not it's not as good as Aperture
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.440]  and it's not as good as Lightroom. But I also feel like this is a 1.0 product and it feels to me very
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.520]  much iMovie 08 or not even iMovie 08, iMovie 11, where it's like there's there's enough in there
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:29.360]  for the con professional that you won't feel like you're just using baby tools the way that iPhoto
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:39.440]  was. My current struggle with photos for Mac is that I love the syncing. I love the editing tools.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.120]  Favoriting is really easy. Albums are syncing, which is really cool. Still no smart albums on
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.360]  iPhone, which I'm kind of bummed by. I feel like smart albums would be a really great way to
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.520]  organize certain things like screenshots, for example. But maybe it's maybe it's too complicated
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.680]  on iOS right now. Maybe they're maybe it's like a back project. But my my problem is I already
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.280]  pay 10 bucks a month for Dropbox for, you know, having a terabyte of storage. And I have all my
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.280]  photos in Dropbox. And now I'm paying, you know, I'm currently paying four bucks a month for iCloud
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.920]  Photo Library and iCloud services. But I'm sure I'm going to have to upgrade to the next tier as
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:22.720]  soon as I integrate my entire photo library into photos for Mac. Right now I have about five
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.760]  thousand photos and I think I have like thirty five forty thousand photos sitting in Dropbox
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:33.040]  that I still have to to integrate into this new library. And I'm a little afraid about how much
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:40.640]  money I'm going to have to pay Apple every month to store all of those. And also there's the Apple
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.960]  has, you know, Apple wants to make it really, really simple when it comes to optimizing photos.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.080]  I had a big conversation with some of the Apple reps about like how the that checkbox that says
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:55.360]  optimize only like a certain subset of the photos on your hard drive and how that works. And
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:02.960]  basically it's it's dynamic. So it depends on how much space you have free and how much space you
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.640]  have on your hard drive total. And it often like it chooses the photos automatically for you based
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:14.080]  on like what photos you've opened recently, the photos in your favorites and any photos that
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.200]  you're editing immediately get pulled down from the cloud, which is like that's that's nice. And
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.760]  and I like the idea of having to take it out of the user's hands. But at the same time,
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.720]  it makes it a little hard to be like, all right, well, I know I want a specific album
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:35.360]  to show to people. Do I have to star each one of those photos individually? Like, do I do I have
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.840]  to copy all of those photos and put them into a Dropbox album to make sure that they stay locally
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.480]  on my machine versus getting vanished up into the cloud? Do I have to open all of them right? You
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.360]  know, it's, it's the Apple tries to make things super easy. And for the majority of people,
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.440]  they're super easy. And it's great. And then there are the the weird use cases where you're like,
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.280]  I just, I really just want to know that my photos are here so that I can use them.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.880]  It's a really hard problem. It is it is really wide ranging. Once you once you start thinking
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:15.520]  about everything that you need in a complete photo system, everything from import and reading
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:21.040]  all the various raw formats of all the various cameras and doing a good job of that, which
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.520]  in and of itself is like an underappreciated thing that Apple is doing. You know,
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.600]  how many times do you get like a Mac OS X update that includes, you know,
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.040]  up support for raw cameras? Yeah, that's like 40 new raw cameras. And you think I didn't know
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:41.040]  that there were that many cameras from that to all the editing and the smarts of that that you want
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:46.240]  and then but then you get into the sinking stuff. And it's so complicated. You know, it's, you know,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.480]  like this thing about like with Apple Watch, like, I know that there's some people who are like,
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.840]  I think that they've said they've, you know, it's officially documented that there's only 75 megabytes
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.480]  of storage for photos, photos. Yep. And everybody's like, well, that's crazy. Because it's like, no,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.800]  they're not going to get it. You're not going to put your full size photos, they're going to scale
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.800]  them because it doesn't make any sense to have a tiny retina screen. Why would you have full size
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.320]  photos, 20 megapixel photos, right? Even like eight megapixel photos right off the iPhone
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:20.160]  doesn't make any sense. It's only a it's a 42 millimeter screen. Yeah. You know, you're going
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.840]  to be able to fit a lot of photos in 75 megabytes. But how do you do that scaling? Where does that
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:31.760]  where does that happen? And, you know, it's just so complicated. Yeah. And I Well, I feel like
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.680]  they've gotten they've gotten some of that kind of figured out already. Because when when photos
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.400]  aren't stored, so I have optimization turned on for both my MacBook Air and my iPhone, because I
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:51.360]  don't want, you know, 5000 5000 photos worth of space taken up on my computer. And for all of the
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:58.320]  photos that aren't stored locally, you still see, like low res previews. And I have to wonder if
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:05.040]  those low res previews happen to be the same size as our nice little retina screen. I feel like the
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:12.480]  what the the 38 millimeter is something like 212 by 300 something. So those are those are pretty
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:17.760]  small pictures to begin with. So it may just be that like, all of those low res snapshots that
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:25.680]  that photos for Mac and photos for iOS stores by default may be the perfect size for for retina on
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.720]  and those don't take up very much space at all. I think those are those are probably like kilobytes.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:38.400]  Yeah. So anyway, what is your overall verdict so far on I found the the beta for Mac?
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.680]  It's surprisingly solid. Actually, I am especially even from the first beta,
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.800]  I had a couple of problems. Initially, with iCloud photo library randomly turning off,
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.720]  where I turn it on, and then I'd relaunch photos for Mac, and it would be off and I turn it on
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:38:00.080]  again. But aside from that, it's really fast, even I've got 5050 photos in it right now.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:07.200]  And the thing scrolls ridiculously fast. Like, I'm, I'm in the bay, I'm scrolling through it
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.280]  right now while I'm talking to you. And again, I'm on a MacBook Air, it's not like, not like I have
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:19.200]  100 cores at my disposal or a really high level video card. But it it's speedy opening up photos
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.760]  that aren't stored like I'm going to go back. I don't know. Here's something from CES that's
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.960]  almost definitely not stored. And it took two seconds to load up from from online it does like
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:37.200]  it's it's it's super fast. Also, I really appreciate how how well it syncs with iCloud.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.000]  iCloud has always been one of those things where, you know, it can either work really well, or it
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:51.440]  can just completely wet the bed. And, and especially I noticed this, I was bored on a
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.440]  flight back from San Francisco, and the internet was completely, completely failing because, you
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.880]  know, Google Air is either great or it's terrible. So I was just sitting on my sitting on my iPhone
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.240]  and playing a bunch of like Altos adventure and then going into photos and being like,
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.400]  you know what, I'm just going to go through all the photos I have on my, on my phone and like,
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:16.000]  delete and organize accordingly, because I've got nothing else to do. And I've got all of these
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.720]  photos. And I know I've got like duplicates and things like that. And I did all of this with no
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.040]  internet access. And in the back of my head, and this includes like photos that aren't stored
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.720]  locally on the device that have like the little processing symbol on them. And in the back of my
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.000]  head, I'm like, is this going to accidentally screw over my entire library? Well, might as well find
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.440]  out. It's a beta, right? And it synced everything perfectly. And all the favorites that like I queued
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.240]  while I was offline, it pulled all of those down as soon as I got off the plane and like,
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:51.120]  reconnected to LTE. And something like that is really, really a big market change for Apple,
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:58.000]  at least for me, where, you know, I, I basically did all of that, having implicit trust that my
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.600]  photos wouldn't either disappear or accidentally triplicate. And I was right, granted that, you
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.880]  know, that may not be 100% of the time I it worked for me, maybe it won't work for other people. I'm
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.120]  kind of hoping that it's, that it's better though. I'm like, I haven't really run into any photo loss
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.440]  problems with iCloud photo library. And that was my biggest concern, because your photos are
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.600]  precious. You know, that's, that's the one thing that I'm always super concerned about your photos
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.000]  are potentially your life. You know, they're, they are, I mean, they are, they're snapshots
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.480]  of your life. Well, it's, it's true. It's, and it's like, when you talk to people who've worked,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.040]  I mean, you even did. So you've probably, maybe you have firsthand experience, but you talk to
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.080]  people who work at Apple stores. It's like that, like worst part of the job is somebody who comes
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.440]  in and has a dead hard drive, and it can't be resuscitated. And then they, they start to cry.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:53.520]  And they say, you know, my, you know, my husband died a couple months ago, and I have my last year
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.680]  of pictures with them, or they're only on that hard drive, or something like that. And it truly,
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:04.720]  you know, you can't even overstate how devastating it can be. It really is like, like the probably
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.760]  the most important data that Apple keeps.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.560]  Yeah, it's, it's incredibly vital digital data. And we think about, you know, old analog photos,
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.960]  oh, I've got, you know, boxes and boxes of snapshots that maybe I'll never look at again.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.800]  But those boxes are there unless they get burned down in a fire, you know,
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.600]  Which is a lot less, it's a real issue. I mean, and it's definitely happened or water damage,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:33.200]  you know, you know, it's water damage and fire are two huge things for, you know,
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.880]  archive boxes or albums of photos. Yeah, but those things are less common than hard drives going
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.440]  belly up.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.000]  Yeah, exactly. And you could argue, well, digital data is a lot easier to replicate,
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.360]  which is true. And it's like the more copies you have of something, the better.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:53.440]  But there's still that, that fear. I mean, I lost when my, my last big hard drive crash and the one
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.000]  that kind of forced me to think very seriously about good backup solutions. I did an art project
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.280]  with a friend where we went across the country and did a made comedy and tragedy masks and like,
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.400]  took pictures in front of various historic landmarks. So we had these wonderful photos
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.840]  of like hanging over the Niagara Falls with tragedy, like looking and, you know,
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.160]  tragedy, like looking and potentially like, Oh, what, how far down is it? And we had like a,
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:28.560]  we had a digital camera, and we took 80% of those photos, and all of them were lost in that hard
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.080]  drive crash. And I did, I was lucky that we also were taking some backup photos with like a really
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.880]  crappy, like 24 exposure Instacamera because we just thought, well, that might be fun, have some
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.120]  like real media with the digital media when we do our exhibition. And those are the only records
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.120]  that I have that that trip even existed. It's, I mean, it's not, not nearly as, as heartbreaking
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.480]  or as sad as like losing, you know, losing photos of a loved one. Yeah, exactly. But it's still a,
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:01.840]  you know, it's still a mark in your life. Photos are one of the, photos and Twitter at this point
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.120]  are like the, the mark points of where I can be like, yes, this is how my life is going. This is,
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:12.080]  this is what I did last week. Because sometimes everything's are, you know, things are so crazy
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.240]  that you, you stop and you forget, you know, the day to day, you forget the funny little moments
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.840]  that happen in the in betweens. And I really, I love that Apple is putting such a big emphasis
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:29.840]  on photos. I think that if they, if they manage to make this work, I mean, they have, they have such
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:34.400]  a wonderful camera in the form of the iPhone. Being able to actually, you know, have those
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:40.960]  memories stored in an easy, easily accessible place, and being able to share them very easily
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.680]  is so much better than what it's been so far, which is dumping them in folders and
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.800]  syncing with Dropbox and praying that like, oh, I'll organize these eventually when someone has
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.240]  a photo organization service that I don't hate. And strategically, it becomes a powerful form
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.560]  of lock in. And you know, the cynical out there can say that that's the primary reason they're
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.920]  doing it. I don't think so. I think that their first goal is let's build a complete workflow.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:12.960]  Everything from sucking in the photos from your iPhone and iPad, to, you know, the photos you
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.920]  import from any standalone camera you might have to where do you store them, which copies are where,
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.240]  and how are they so that you can get them anywhere, anytime from any of your devices.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.720]  And, you know, do a good job editing them. I think that it's really about the customer experience.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.840]  But then once they have that in place, and once people can trust it, man, when would you ever
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.760]  want to switch to any other device if if that's part of, you know, your workflow?
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:44.000]  Yeah, it's not just about Oh, I like iPhone, or I like iOS more than I like Android. It's,
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.680]  well, my iPhone has all of my photos on it. It has iCloud. And it has my, you know, it has the
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.000]  heartbeats that I've sent to my husband on my Apple Watch, why would I, why would I want to
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.520]  give that up? And especially I, I didn't even talk about, you know, the the project side of photos
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.680]  for Mac, which like they've carried over the same things that you can do for my photo, but they,
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:09.200]  they added a bunch of other prints and dynamic prints now so that you don't have to instead of
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:16.320]  having to like crop photos for a certain size, you can print photos no matter what size or shape they
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.720]  are. So you can print like square photos, or you can even print panoramas and Apple will like
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:27.200]  automatically like print any size photos for you and like being able to not only store them
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.440]  digitally, but also have the option of having those physical copies and you never have to
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:35.920]  worry about going to a Walmart or a Rite Aid or anything like that or, you know, it's just there.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:43.120]  That leads me to a serendipitous segue. Our last sponsor of the show
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:52.160]  are good friends at Fracture. So speaking of getting analog printouts of your photos,
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:46:02.400]  Fracture is a service that takes your photos and prints them directly on glass. They don't take a
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.040]  piece of paper, print it on paper and then put the paper behind the glass. They've got some kind of
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:15.280]  crazy proprietary process where they take frames of glass and print your photos directly on them,
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.120]  very much like a retina screen where it makes the picture look like it's on the glass
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:28.720]  on the glass, not behind glass. They have all sorts of sizes ranging from the small
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:36.080]  to medium to classic to large. Their large one is just downright huge. It's like 28 inches by 21
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:43.120]  inches, something like that. Really, really big though. They also have square and the square ones
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.480]  go from very small, perfect for a desktop all the way up to I think the biggest square size
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:56.800]  they have is 23 by 23 inches. Truly, truly wall size. They ship with everything you need
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.760]  to hang them on the wall, to prop them up on your desk, to prop them up on a mantle or a
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.400]  shelf or something like that. It's all there right in the cardboard packaging that your
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.840]  Fracture ships with. Very, very clever. It's clever enough just to check them out just to
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:21.920]  see the way they pack these things and package them in and of themselves. They have great prices,
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.080]  really high quality, great customer service. If you go to their website at fractureme.com,
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.880]  they even have a really cool blog where they show great examples of what people are doing with
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:42.320]  Fracture and even things like apps, app reviews for iOS photo editing apps and tips and stuff
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.080]  like that to get better photos. If you're into photography, it's a great website just to check
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:55.760]  out for the photo nerdery that they get into. And best of all, they have a great deal for listeners
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:03.040]  of the talk show. They have a coupon code, daring fireball, all one word. Just type that in when you
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:10.880]  buy and anything you get with that code, you will get 15 percent off. So the prices are already
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.120]  great. Use that code during fireball, though, and they'll know you came from the show. They'll know
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.880]  that you're that's how you got to know fracture and you'll save serious money. The big ones are
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:26.160]  expensive. I mean, I think, you know, it's like one hundred twenty five bucks to get the the
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:33.360]  biggest size that they have. Hey, 15 percent off on that is real money. So go ahead and check out
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:40.240]  fracture at fractureme.com and remember that code during fireball, which will save you some bucks
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:46.800]  and help support the show. So here we are, we're an hour and 40 some minutes into the show, hour
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:54.400]  and 50 minutes, and we haven't even talked about Apple Watch yet. I have been thinking about the
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.120]  timing of the event and I'm still confused why they held it when they did, because March 9th
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:07.280]  is just so far in advance of them taking preorders a month later and six weeks ahead of them shipping.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:14.080]  And I can't help but think that, you know, I've been talking with your colleague at Rene Ritchie
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:20.080]  about some of this, and the consensus seems to be that Apple kind of got locked into that date
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.960]  because they expected maybe like when they locked in Yerba Buena and started making the plans for
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:31.760]  the event that they were sort of expecting to ship the watch sooner than they're going to. Maybe like
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:39.360]  an early April thing instead of a late April thing. Yeah, I'm kind of I'm two minds on that
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:46.400]  because on one hand, I think that, yeah, they were timing to go for a specific date and a specific
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:52.640]  time and say like hoping that we'll, you know, we'll launch for a good solid spring. But then
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.720]  I think as that kind of slipped a little bit when we got Tim Cook saying April in the last
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.800]  financial call, I want to say, for the watch's launch. And then they're like, well, we've got
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:12.560]  this. But honestly, my real thought is it gives the appropriate buildup for sort of the anticipation
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:18.880]  of the watch gives them time to roll it out in magazines. And it also gives them it gives them
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:25.440]  the time to showcase them in the stores, not only to build the build and put in the tables that
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.160]  they're going to need to show off the watches. But also, I mean, starting April 10, they're going to
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.560]  have appointments for people to be able to come in and try on the watches and play with them and
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.760]  really get a sense for how they, you know, up till now, like I've played with some and you you were
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.720]  at the September event, right? And you you've played with some. But the majority of the public,
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:51.040]  all they've seen about the watch is a ton of news articles and a couple of maybe like 15 second very
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.280]  dark and blurry hands on with the watches. They really haven't had a chance to experience it
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:01.760]  themselves in their hands. And it's it's what you know, makes the Apple stores magical. And it's
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.680]  always made them magical is that people can come in and actually like get to see how this product
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:13.120]  might change their life. And I think giving people two to three weeks to really get a chance to have
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:18.480]  some hands on time and to see what you know, not only see all right, what kind of band combination
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.280]  do I want? Do I want the watch the sport? Do I want the watch? Do I want to like ogle the
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.240]  edition because I'll never in a million years be able to afford it. Um, you also really get a
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.000]  chance to see what it's good for and and what it might actually do for your life versus, you know,
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.920]  all of us assholes in journalism were like, this is what the Apple Watch is going to do for you,
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.480]  or this is what the Apple Watch absolutely won't do. And this is why the Apple Watch is useless.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.240]  This is why the Apple Watch is wonderful. But being able to, to, to sort of have a little
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:54.320]  bit of time to play with it yourself and be like, Oh, oh, I see how useful this is. Oh,
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:58.720]  Siri actually works. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.760]  multi variable. I mean, retail is definitely part of it. Hype is definitely part of it.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.960]  Publicity is definitely part of it. Um, I think even the editorial schedule of
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:15.520]  fashion magazines is part of it because they have a longer lead time. Um, but I've been
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:20.880]  thinking about it and I definitely detect, I mean, I wasn't at the event last week,
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:27.520]  but just from what I can tell from the outside and from the small bits of communication I've
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:34.000]  had with, with Apple, um, you know, in the last few weeks about the lead up to Apple Watch and
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:44.720]  just from what I've seen is that they're doing, uh, you know, a full court press on Apple Watch
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:53.120]  that to me, they only really bring out this, this level of, of publicity and hype and PR emphasis
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:53:00.560]  PR emphasis for brand new products. And, and they don't really do brand new products that often.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:08.480]  I mean, the last 10 years, there's only three, the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, and now this,
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.600]  the watch in 2015. And I just, I get the feeling that the differences that they,
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.840]  when you already have momentum and iPads are already selling and iPhones are already selling,
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.400]  then you can just say new iPhone and you can assume they know what an iPhone is and you just
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:28.720]  tell them, well, here's the stuff that's new and better in the new one. Whereas with something
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:37.200]  altogether new, like watch, um, they really feel like they have to do an extra amount of effort
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:44.640]  just to get the baseline level of consumer interest up and peaked at the right time
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.560]  for when they're going to start taking orders and start letting people into the stores.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:54.000]  Absolutely. I mean, you look at, you look at the sheer amount of press that Tim Cook alone is doing
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:59.040]  and the interviews that he's given every single interview, there's at least one moment where
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:03.200]  someone's like, are you wearing the Apple watch? And he's like, yes I am. And then proceeds to do
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:08.640]  a quick, like two minute demo of something cool on it. And it's every time it's a slightly different,
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:13.760]  you know, demo. It's not, he doesn't do the same. Like I can check my calendars. I can play,
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.920]  I can Apple pay. You know, I think about the first one, I think the first one was Charlie Rose.
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:23.120]  Is that, was that right? The PBS one? Yeah. Um, where he spent like two or three minutes and he
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:27.760]  did show off Apple pay in that one. And then each subsequent one, like Goldman Sachs, he talked
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.240]  about like why it was useful for him. And, um, there was that most, the fast company article
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.960]  that came out what yesterday or this morning that, uh, where he's talking about the watch
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:43.680]  glances and every, it always feels, I really admire Tim Cook in that way for the very subtle
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.000]  way he's able to do product marketing demos without making them feel like product marketing
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.720]  demos. I don't know whether it's the way that he presents himself or just the, the, like,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.320]  it's a very casual way of like, Oh, I'm taught, you know, Oh, the watch, this old thing. Yeah,
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.160]  let me talk about this. And before you know it, I've given you a three minute demo and you,
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.440]  you just think I'm talking about myself and like what I'm doing. It's, it's really smart.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.080]  I don't think it's any coincidence that Johnny Ive has done more press in the last
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.240]  two, three months, uh, than in the rest of his year combined, the rest of his career,
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.600]  I should say combined. Of course. I, well, I mean, you think there, there are a lot of
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.920]  things riding on this, right? It's the first major post Steve new product launch. I mean,
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:31.440]  I think that Tim Cook and his team has done an incredible job and, you know, in jobs as absence,
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:37.360]  but it's still like, this is, this is their first product. And, um, and I'm actually like,
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:44.240]  I'm proud of the press for not being like the first post jobs, you know, like making such a,
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.880]  such a big deal of it. But I definitely like, it's got to be weighing on them a little bit,
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.960]  um, to be like, we have to make this a success and we have to be sure that this really,
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.000]  this launches out the door like gangbusters. Um, and it's also the, you know, how many,
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:04.000]  I haven't worn a watch in 10 years. Um, a lot of people I know are, you know, watches,
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:11.200]  watches are not a daily, uh, daily wear item like they used to be. Um, and smartwatches,
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.840]  especially I have not, you know, up until I tried on the 38 millimeter Apple watch,
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.920]  there was not a single smartwatch on the market that would fit my wrist. Like,
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:25.120]  and smartwatches just aren't like, weren't targeted towards women at all. Like, not even,
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.320]  not even like in a misogynistic, like, huh, huh, no women for smartwatches. But it's just like,
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.400]  no one was thinking about small wrists and how a small, like how a smartwatch screen might work
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.360]  on a small wrist. And Apple was the first one, you know, the, the Apple watch is the first one,
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.160]  uh, at least for me where I'm like, oh, this not only fits on my wrist, but it's still functional.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.560]  I can still do things on it. It's not like they've squished the screen down so far that,
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.000]  you know, it's now impossible to use, even though it, it, it, it looks semi nice. So it's,
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.640]  you know, I think they're facing the wearable issue too. Like everybody needs a phone. Everybody
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:05.760]  was going to need a smartphone. A tablet's a bigger one, but. I know it's just a few millimeters,
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:13.200]  but, uh, a few millimeters here, a few millimeters there. And at this size, it makes a big difference.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:20.000]  Um, I think that the, the, the highest praise design for a smartwatch to date, at least one
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.920]  that got a lot of mass market attention is the Moto 360, AKA the Moto 2.0. And it's,
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.840]  it's 270 because it has the flat bottom on the round screen. Um, and I, I don't really
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:35.840]  particularly care for it, but I think that, you know, it's a lot of people have, have praised
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:43.040]  the design. Um, but in the grand scheme of things, it's a relatively large watch. Yes.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:50.560]  And, uh, the first person who I've seen wearing it was Andy and ATCO. Did you see it at the,
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:54.240]  at the September event? Cause that's when I saw Andy's watch was actually right,
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.000]  right before we went in the doors for the Apple event. And I was actually like,
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.680]  Hey Andy, I've heard good things about this. Can you take this off? And can I put it on for a
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:09.520]  second? And he gives the Moto to me and I put it on my wrist and the watch face itself, the 360,
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:15.360]  270, you know, is actually physically larger than the diameter of my wrist. Like there were,
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:21.840]  there are parts hanging off each side. And at that point I was just kind of like, yeah, it's,
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:27.040]  it's a pretty watch on you, Andy. But, um, like this, this would basically look like I'm carrying
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:31.840]  around half a handcuff. I think the bottom line is that the more we learn about Apple watch
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:41.360]  and the more we kind of get a sense of it is that it it's like you, I feel like you can't
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:49.440]  overstate just how ambitious it is as a platform. It's not just telling the time and getting your
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:56.640]  text notifications on your wrist at the same time. Uh, it's a real platform and there is an
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:02.560]  inherent complexity to anything that ambitious. And I don't know that it's a problem because I
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:08.080]  feel like the main things you're going to want to do, um, you'll be able to figure out, you're
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:11.200]  going to be able to figure out how to adjust your watch face and pick the one that you want. And
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.400]  you're going to be able to pick out the complications you want on the watch face.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.080]  But I don't think it's quite as simple as the iPhone was in 2007, the iPhone, you hit the home
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:25.840]  button and there were, I think it was 13 apps that were right there on the home screen. And those 13
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:32.560]  apps on the home screen gave you a quick one screen overview of the scope of what you could
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.800]  do with the app and just the names of the apps would let you know what they were. Um, I don't
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.200]  think Apple watch has that many more apps, but it's more, and there are a couple of other
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:47.840]  contextual modes that the original iPhone didn't have like glances and notification center that
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:52.000]  give you a little bit of extra complicit complexity in terms of where are you and how
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.600]  do you get back to where you were? Um, and I, in some sense, I think it's almost more like a Mac
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:05.360]  in that sense of not being a problem in so far as that you can be a Mac user and not have explored
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:11.120]  the entire system and used every app. And that doesn't mean that the Mac is too complex or too
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:17.440]  complicated because you're able to figure out the things you really want to do. Absolutely. So I went
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:21.920]  to the Apple watch page out of curiosity and I was like, all right, how many, how many default apps
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:27.280]  are there? And if you're, if you're not counting the clock functions, there are 16 and if you count
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:34.240]  the alarm stopwatch timer and world clock, you get 20 total. Uh, so you've got, you know, seven more
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:42.560]  apps off the bat. Um, still, I mean, overall, you've got a very similar, um, similar build to
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:48.320]  the original phone in terms of like messages, SMS, phone, mail, calendar, but you've got two
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:52.080]  apps dedicated to the exercise portion, which you were just talking about. And I think that's,
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:55.440]  that's going to be really key for the watch, especially if we didn't really touch on research
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.520]  kit. Um, but it's some, that's something that really sort of made an impression to me during
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.640]  the event. Um, the idea that, you know, Apple, Apple's not only going to build this revolutionary
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.760]  technology, but they're actually going to put this revolutionary technology to work at making our
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.680]  lives not only better, but potentially longer, um, by using all of this integrated stuff that
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.880]  they've been putting together over the last two or three years. Um, but yeah, you've got, you've
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:27.040]  got maps, passbook and Siri, which of course are new, um, in the last couple of years, camera
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:34.240]  remote, which hooks directly into your phone, uh, or, uh, Apple TV remote, which I'm excited
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.720]  to actually see and play with. Like there's, there's so much more, it's such a more mature,
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:45.360]  as you were saying, it's a more mature product. I think that it's, um, Apple has, Apple's learned
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:51.760]  from its, its successes, its failures, its mistakes. It's, it's, you know, wins. Um, the
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.200]  fact that they're, you know, watch kit is still very rudimentary and it is built, you know,
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:02.640]  they're extensions, basically. They're not full apps. And I don't even know yet whether or not
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.280]  like third-party apps will be able to really run on the, on the app if, or on the, on the watch,
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.160]  if your phone is not, um, in wifi range. I don't know if that's, that's something that you can do
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.640]  with current watch apps, watch kit apps. But, um, but the fact that there are watch kit apps at all
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.040]  for the first generation of the Apple watch is huge. The fact that people have been able to
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.160]  develop for them since November is huge. And the fact that Phil Schiller basically said,
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.960]  this is step one and full native watch apps are going to be coming soon. Like they're,
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:38.640]  they're clearly, I mean, there's, there's a lot of thought that's been put into this, this launch.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:44.560]  Yeah. Just today in the Fast Company article, the interview with Tim Cook with the authors of
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:52.160]  becoming T Steve jobs, Brent Schlander and, uh, Rick Ted Zellie, um, Tim Cook specifically
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:58.960]  mentioned the difference between iPhone launching without an app store a year out from an app store
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:08.720]  and, um, Apple watch launching with an SDK that came out months in advance and maybe not full
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:14.800]  fledged apps, but watch, you know, with third party developer support right there on day one.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.840]  And, you know, they're already promoting these apps, uh, third party apps before the watch is
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.200]  even out. And just how different that is, how much more fully formed this platform is at this point
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:32.480]  than iPhone was in, in 2007, especially Tim Cook's Fast Company article. I just, it really,
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:39.920]  it really spoke to me, uh, Cook throughout the article really emphasizes, um, that the watch
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:46.080]  couldn't have been made without Apple's culture and without Apple's sort of big picture focus on,
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.360]  uh, what, what did you say that, um, not living in a small box. And he says, it's, you know,
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:56.320]  a thing, a thing from Steve about, you know, putting your debt in the universe. Um, but that,
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.520]  that comes up repeatedly throughout the article about, you know, not limited,
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.320]  like operating as if you do not have limits and, you know, if you run into limits, acknowledging
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:09.440]  them and then moving past them and, and really, you know, believing that you can, you know,
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:16.000]  that you can work and live and build in a world, um, where you're not, you're not boxed in,
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.320]  you're not limited by outside factors. Um, I, you know, I, I feel like that that's a,
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.600]  that's a philosophy that can occasionally, you know, go, uh, go a really bad way. Uh, but,
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:34.480]  with the watch, it really does feel like they, like always Apple took their time. They stepped
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:38.880]  back and they said, all right, let's, you know, let's really machine this thing within an inch
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:43.760]  of its life. Let's make sure that, you know, what we're releasing is the absolute best product that
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:48.080]  we are most proud to put, you know, our names on. Cause yeah, you're, you're absolutely right. They
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:52.080]  could have released a watch last year and it could have been bare bones and it probably, you know,
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:55.840]  it probably would have outsold the pebble two to one, but you talk about, you know,
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:01.520]  when we look at, you know, the, the most recent Samsung galaxy, the S6 phone, right? It's at this
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:07.200]  point, Apple has, Apple has become a company that everybody looks to whether or not they put out a,
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:13.440]  a gangbuster blockbuster product or just a, uh, incremental revision. People look to them, people,
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:19.440]  you know, copy, innovate, build off of their ideas. Um, and if they had put out, you know,
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:25.760]  if they had put out Apple watch version 0.5, um, with no app store and with limited apps, they,
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.320]  they probably still would have had the basic design down. They would have had the digital
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.040]  crown. They would have had the, the button and then, you know, the, then they'd have to not only
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:37.600]  deal with their own internal struggle of being like, all right, well, we need to make this super,
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.520]  you know, we need to make this even better. We need to figure out how a way to, to elevate this.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.720]  But then they also would have to deal with the competition, trying to copy the few things that
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:53.360]  made it unique in the first place. Do you see this article last week? Um, uh, Greg Konig wrote it,
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:06:02.800]  uh, how Apple makes the watch. Um, it's just great speculation. I mean, he admits that speculation,
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.600]  but based on those three videos that Apple put out with how they work with the aluminum,
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:12.800]  how they work with stainless steel, how they work with gold and looking at the processes that they
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:20.240]  use, the, the, the milling, the, uh, smelting, whatever you want to call it. And just talking
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:24.480]  about the details and Greg knows what he's doing. He's I've known him for years, uh, through,
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:30.400]  he works with my friend Duncan Davidson on Luma loop, these great custom made high-end,
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:35.360]  um, camera slings, you know, and, uh, you put them around your chest and you can attach your camera
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:40.800]  to them. And Greg's the guy who designs all the, the little pieces that are, that are, that are
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:46.000]  designed to all the, the little pieces, the connectors, the O rings, you know, the, everything
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.680]  that goes on at the metal. So he knows what he's talking about when it comes to working with metals
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:55.920]  like aluminum and steel and stuff like that and making high quality stuff. Um, and I thought one
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.800]  of the points, his whole article is great. I'll put it in the show notes, but the point that he
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:06.400]  makes that I thought really stood out is that the smaller the device, the more the attention to
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:14.160]  detail matters in the market. And I've thought that firsthand, having seen these watches in
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:19.120]  September, that no matter how good Apple's product photography is and their product photography is,
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:24.400]  you know, top of the line, it's as good as anybody's no product shot really does justice
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:31.760]  to how good these Apple watches look in person. When you feel them in your hand and you look at
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:37.360]  them in your own eyes, close up, um, the attention to detail is really, really great. And I think you
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:42.560]  need the, that firsthand experience, which means going into an Apple retail store or some other
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:46.800]  place where they sell them to, to see it and to get excited about buying it. And I think Apple
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:53.920]  knows this. It's, it's just as beautiful a piece of jewelry as it is a smartwatch. And I think that,
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:58.560]  I mean, you, you take Mark Newsome and Joni Ivan, you put them in a room together. Obviously they're
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.640]  going to make something, something gorgeous, something that you'd be proud to wear on your
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:10.720]  wrist. But the fact that they were able to do this and include, you know, watchOS, you know,
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:16.000]  include iOS, include all of this, all of the extra stuff and make it look just as beautiful
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.880]  in your hand as it is when you're actually physically interacting with the display. It's,
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:24.560]  it's absolutely incredible. And those bands, that was another thing that I really noticed in April
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.720]  is I didn't get a chance to play with a lot of the bands in September. I think I, you know,
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:33.360]  I tried on the sport and I had two, maybe two minutes with it, if that. So I was like,
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:39.520]  pink sport band. Okay. This is really nicely built for a sport band, but in April, I got a chance,
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.640]  or in April, in March, I got a chance to play with, I got a chance to see the leather band
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.480]  and the, the, both the modern buckle and the classic buckle. And I got a chance to try the
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:55.120]  Milanese loop, which I thought I was going to absolutely hate because I'm not, I'm like,
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.760]  I'm not a fan of metal bands. They're cold, you know, they, they get caught in your, your hair.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:05.600]  And I put that on and I'm like, Oh my God, I like, I was planning on getting a leather band
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.240]  and now I have to completely reevaluate my whole, my whole plan. Cause they're,
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.960]  those bands are beautiful. I mean, yeah, I got to try the Milanese back in September. And I
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:18.560]  remember thinking I wouldn't like it because I like to wear my watch, not tight, but snug.
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:26.080]  And it seemed to me, given that it was magnetic, that if I closed the Milanese loop to be snug
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.560]  enough to be pleasant, then when I'd flex my wrist, the fact that it was only connected
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.320]  magnetically, it would slide, you know, the magnetic closure would slide along the band
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:39.200]  and then it would be too loose. But that wasn't the case at all. It's once you have it on somehow
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.680]  the magnet for lateral forces, it's very, very tight. And if you flex your wrist, it doesn't
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:49.280]  change. But yet it's not so strong that if you want to take it off, that if you get your finger
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:55.520]  underneath it and pick it straight off, that it's hard to get off. You really have to try it to
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:59.280]  believe it. Yeah. It's, it's exactly like the force touch track that it's, it's one of those
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.240]  things that, I mean, I really, sometimes I wonder if Apple intentionally makes products where
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.200]  they're like, you have to come and try it out before you purchase it, because we really want
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.480]  you to see just how ridiculously good it is. Yeah. I don't, I think the retail stores are
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.400]  important to everything. Apple sells small, big Mac, iOS, whatever. It's been important to the
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.440]  whole success story over the last 15 years. I mean, people don't talk about the halo effect
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:29.920]  anymore, but I think that definitely was what fueled it, where people would come in because
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.480]  they wanted to buy an iPod. And back in the early days, they'd even call it the iPod store.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.400]  And eventually they'd say, Hey, I like this store. I like this people, this company's products. Maybe
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.080]  I'll try one of their computers and I'll try one of their phones and et cetera, et cetera.
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:47.440]  So I'm not trying to underplay the importance of Apple's retail stores in any of their products,
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.240]  but I really do think that the hands-on nature of a watch and the personal nature of it and
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:11:00.000]  the attention to detail, that's only visible at real life distance and size that the watch is the
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.840]  first Apple product where their stores, their retail stores are essential to the success of
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:11.280]  the product. I don't think they could be doing this without retail, without their own retail.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.760]  Yeah. I mean, I honestly don't think they would have been able to sell the iPhone or the iPad
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.160]  the way they did without the Apple stores. And just that the displays are one of the,
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.320]  like the multi-touch display. When you try to explain to people, Oh yeah, you can do this
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.240]  and you can pinch and you can zoom. And people would say, Oh yeah, I've used quote unquote,
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:37.440]  multi-touch displays before. Those are those awful things you use at the movies and they scroll and
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:42.000]  they lag and they're terrible. And then you actually, you know, you'd go into a store and
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.800]  try one and, and you realize, Oh, this was, you know, this is so fast. This is instantaneous.
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.400]  I really do kind of feel like the experience with the watch is going to be very similar
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.440]  where, you know, again, with the, with Force Touch, with, with the with the digital crown,
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.880]  uh, with, you know, just all the interactions that you can use on the, on the watch. I was,
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.280]  I did this week in tech last week and one of the commenters, like during the show, they have the,
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:12.320]  like the live chat. One of the commenters was like, you know, I was, I was talking about how
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:18.400]  I'm really excited to use the, use the watch as a driving tool because I hate mounting my phone.
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.800]  Cause it's just like, it's a big giant screen and it's like, it's distracting you, even if you're
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:25.600]  trying to get directions or something. And I'm like, Oh, well the watch is going to be really
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.000]  cool because it, you know, it's going to buzz you while you're, you know, to tell you to take a left
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.080]  or a right and it's going to do different buzzes. So you're going to know like which, which direction
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:43.920]  you need to turn. Um, and, uh, I, uh, I, I really think that, uh, I was like, Oh yeah. And then,
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.000]  and you can use it to Siri to dictate. And someone says, Oh, you're crazy. You're going to use a
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.440]  watch. Why would you, you know, you're gonna, you know, you're, you're gonna do something while
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:56.400]  you're driving. How dare, you know, you're being an unsafe person. And I'm like, how is that more
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.520]  unsafe than looking at, you know, uh, a built-in screen in your car or looking at your phone
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.160]  mounted to a thing. It's like being able to go to Siri and pull your watch, you know, pull your
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.080]  wrist here to your mouth and say, you know, uh, tell, you know, tell my boyfriend that I'm going
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:18.560]  to be 10 minutes late because there's traffic on the highway. And then it either sends that via,
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:23.760]  you know, it dictates it, or you can send it as an audio message. If the Siri dictation screws up,
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.680]  it's like, I don't even have to look at the watch. It just does it automatically. I don't have to
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.760]  look at a screen. It's it's like, it's just stuff like that. I feel like it's not, there,
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:38.400]  there are scenarios you can't experience or envision unless you go into the store and you try
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:44.720]  it. I just don't understand how they're going to handle the crush of people that are going to be
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:50.080]  coming into the stores to look at the watch. Um, there was a report last week that you were going
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:53.920]  to need an appointment. I know they're definitely taking appointments where you can make one and
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.200]  come in and get some time scheduled, but you can try on various versions. And then now they're
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:02.720]  saying you don't need an appointment, but if you don't have one, you know, you might have to wait.
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:06.480]  And so I get the feeling that it's sort of like a hair salon where it's like, they'll take you
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.520]  if you're a walk-in, but you know, appointments are highly recommended. And I think apartments
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:17.200]  are highly recommended here. Yeah. I imagine, um, it's going to be very similar to our,
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:23.040]  to the press demo hands-ons where, you know, it's a crush of people in that demonstration area.
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:26.000]  And the reps were basically like, all right, we're going to, you know,
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:30.880]  those of you who are just, you know, plebeians who happen to be writing for tech, you know,
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:35.520]  random tech blog, you you'll get five minutes. And if you happen to be from the wall street journal,
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.360]  maybe you'll get like 10 minutes. And if you're a celebrity, we'll, we'll give you like a full 15
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:43.520]  minute tour of, of the watch and several different bands and like what you can do with it.
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:44.960]  Were there celebrities there?
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.960]  Uh, well, Christy Turlington was walking around in the hands-on area and there were definitely,
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.240]  uh, it was a fun game to play during the event being like, all right,
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:56.560]  press Apple engineer or fashion model. There were definitely a lot of,
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:02.240]  a lot of people from the fashion industry, um, there who were VIPs. Um, and there weren't like,
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.000]  there weren't any overt celebrities there that I could, that I could recognize, but I'm also
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.320]  very bad at the celebrity face game. So back in September, there were definitely celebrities.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:17.840]  Oh yeah. Like I, I remember, I mean, what, Stephen Fry was there. Is that right? Yeah.
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:24.560]  And a couple, couple other people. Um, so it's like, I'm not, I'm not surprised by that at all,
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.600]  but in terms of, yeah, how the, how the tables are, I mean, they had the retail store tables
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:34.480]  at the event, which is actually really cool. They have, uh, tables that can only be opened by like
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:39.680]  an employee badge. So all of the watches are like hidden and built into like secure safes that if
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.000]  you have an employee badge, you just like badge it in and then the table like rolls open and you
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.800]  have this beautiful, uh, beautiful jewelry store, hidden counter of like all of the watches and
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:55.920]  their little nestled, uh, containers. It's, it was very, very chic and very cool. Uh, but also, uh,
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:01.440]  you know, I, I am going to be interested to see how they can manage the crush of people.
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:06.000]  You're absolutely right. I, it seems, it seems like the day that, you know, that,
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.640]  that April 10th that people are going to flood and maybe I'm over estimating the demand for the
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:16.240]  watch, but I mean, you saw like that Reuter was Reuters who had the like 65% of people don't want
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:24.560]  to buy an Apple watch. And I'm like, so what you're saying is 35% of people do. Yeah. It wasn't quite
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:31.440]  69% not interested. 31% interested. It was, I think 69% not interested in buying it. They're
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:37.680]  25% interested in buying it and 6% undecided. But even so, even though it wasn't a full 31%,
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.000]  the fact that it was 25% is astounding. And in other words, one out of four people that they
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.240]  polled said they were interested in buying Apple watch, which is a product. None of them have ever
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:51.200]  actually seen in person. None of them have used. They're probably under informed about what it can
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:57.520]  do. And it requires an iPhone five or iPhone six. So with all those things, if one out of four
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:03.440]  Americans wants is interested in buying an Apple watch, if anything, I mean, for them to spin that
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:10.480]  as, as bad news for Apple, or as they called it a sign that it might be a tough sell. It's
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:16.560]  astounding because I, I think it's, if, if the poll is accurate, it's jaw-droppingly good news
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:22.480]  for Apple, maybe the best news in the company's history. That's a blockbuster product. One in four,
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:26.880]  like, can you imagine, can you imagine one in four people buying the original iPhone?
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.640]  So anything else you want to talk about? No, I mean, I think we've covered, we've
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.600]  covered most of the bases. I'm I'm, I don't know. I'm just really excited for, for this year in
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:42.640]  terms of Apple products. Like Apple has so much on its plate right now. I was talking about this
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:48.640]  with Renee, uh, Richie the other day where we're just like, when we were trying to decide, like,
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:53.680]  we, we knew that something else was coming at the spring forward event and we were like, all right,
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:59.360]  what of the potential, like 12 products, like there's the Apple TV thing. I guess we didn't
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.960]  talk about the Apple TV thing, but there's not, there's not much to talk about other than HBO.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:08.320]  And also like clearly this proves that an Apple TV update is coming sometime down the line.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:13.280]  Cause yeah, the, the, the tell was that the, there was the slide at the event where they
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:21.920]  said starting at $69, starting at $69, starting at $69 for a device that there's only one
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:27.920]  configuration, but that wasn't a mistake. I mean, I, that to me is just a clear sign that they know
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:33.920]  that there's new hardware coming and that they just wanted to get this out, uh, for the HBO
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.960]  Game of Thrones, uh, promotion. Yeah. Let's, let's get them off the shelves and into people's living
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:42.480]  rooms in time for them to watch Game of Thrones. And then they're going to be so hooked on the
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:47.440]  service and using AirPlay that when we launched our new device, you know, there's been rumored
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:53.440]  SDK for the Apple TV for God knows how many years, but like, this is, this is probably the year to do
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.840]  it. You know, when you think about like, now you have the watch as a potential controller too,
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:03.280]  in addition to your iPhones, your iPod touches, your iPads, like this is, this is the year to
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.760]  probably launch games on the Apple TV. So let's wrap it up. Um, Serenity Caldwell, you can read
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:18.640]  her writing at iMore where she is a senior editor. Uh, what's your title? I am the managing editor
