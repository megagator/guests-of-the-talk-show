[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  This is gonna be a challenge, Rene.
[00:01.280 --> 00:03.280]  I feel like this is gonna test
[00:03.280 --> 00:05.760]  all of my meager podcast hosting skills
[00:05.760 --> 00:07.020]  to get this in on time.
[00:07.020 --> 00:09.540]  We, you and I, I don't know how many years in a row,
[00:09.540 --> 00:10.800]  we've done a year in review,
[00:10.800 --> 00:12.560]  Apple year in review at the end of the year.
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.400]  This is it.
[00:13.400 --> 00:15.340]  But yet we've got news to cover.
[00:15.340 --> 00:16.280]  How are we gonna do it?
[00:16.280 --> 00:18.080]  There's all sorts of new stuff that is out.
[00:18.080 --> 00:19.520]  I'm not known for my brevity,
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.240]  but I'm gonna make the best of it.
[00:21.240 --> 00:22.440]  Okay.
[00:22.440 --> 00:23.580]  How are you?
[00:23.580 --> 00:24.420]  Good, thank you.
[00:24.420 --> 00:25.380]  How are you doing?
[00:25.380 --> 00:27.000]  Well, I'm doing pretty well.
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.400]  I'm cold, but it's, the good news is I went outside.
[00:29.400 --> 00:30.560]  You have an Intel Mac, though.
[00:30.560 --> 00:31.980]  That's still got a built-in space heater,
[00:31.980 --> 00:33.440]  so you're one up on me now.
[00:33.440 --> 00:36.080]  No, I'm not using an Intel Mac to record this show.
[00:36.080 --> 00:39.080]  I'm on an M1, so I'm drawing no heat from my...
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.520]  Ah, same, yeah, same.
[00:40.520 --> 00:43.180]  I guess year in review, we could start with you.
[00:43.180 --> 00:45.680]  This has been a big year for you,
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.520]  and the last time you were on the show back in June,
[00:48.520 --> 00:49.720]  and nothing had happened yet,
[00:49.720 --> 00:52.280]  but since then, you've started a new gig,
[00:52.280 --> 00:53.340]  and for those who don't know,
[00:53.340 --> 00:55.080]  why don't you talk about it?
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.160]  Yeah, I joined YouTube as creator liaison,
[00:58.160 --> 01:01.200]  and it's interesting because I was done.
[01:01.200 --> 01:02.800]  My old company got bought out
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.800]  by some giant UK media conglomerate,
[01:05.800 --> 01:08.020]  and it wasn't my scene, so I quit.
[01:08.020 --> 01:09.560]  I went independent.
[01:09.560 --> 01:10.840]  Mutual friend, Dave Whiskus,
[01:10.840 --> 01:13.960]  helped me get a whole YouTube thing going, and it was great.
[01:13.960 --> 01:15.340]  Never gonna work for a company again,
[01:15.340 --> 01:17.760]  and then a guy I knew, a friend of mine, Matt Koval,
[01:17.760 --> 01:20.920]  who was the YouTube creator liaison, he resigned,
[01:20.920 --> 01:22.180]  and I'd heard about that,
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.920]  and it was a couple months going on,
[01:23.920 --> 01:25.980]  and then another friend of mine who works at YouTube said,
[01:25.980 --> 01:28.600]  you should try out for the job, and I just kept saying,
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.400]  no, I'm done, I'm never working for a company again.
[01:31.400 --> 01:33.800]  I said, just meet with the team, and I did,
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.200]  and it was, I swear to jobs, John,
[01:36.200 --> 01:37.320]  it was one of those moments
[01:37.320 --> 01:38.760]  where you're walked around the park,
[01:38.760 --> 01:40.740]  and they say, you don't wanna keep making soda water,
[01:40.740 --> 01:43.000]  or come with us and dent the universe,
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.680]  because it was really this opportunity to help people,
[01:45.680 --> 01:48.760]  to help creators, and all the people that they touch
[01:48.760 --> 01:51.720]  at a scale that's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
[01:51.720 --> 01:53.600]  and I always figured helping people choose phones,
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.200]  helping people choose laptops, that's all great,
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.320]  but the ability to help people change lives
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.040]  was something I couldn't pass up,
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.640]  so I decided to try to get the job,
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.120]  and then I was very lucky to get it.
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.600]  I will say, you do seem, and I do feel like
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.160]  when you announced it, which was a surprise,
[02:11.160 --> 02:13.140]  you kept it a surprise for me, including,
[02:13.140 --> 02:14.120]  all you'd let me know is that
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.600]  you had an announcement coming up, I did not press you,
[02:16.600 --> 02:19.620]  which I think you will agree, I was a good friend,
[02:19.620 --> 02:22.160]  let you have your secret, I know how that is,
[02:22.160 --> 02:24.120]  but I do feel that once you announced it,
[02:24.120 --> 02:28.120]  everybody sort of had the unique, or the same reaction,
[02:28.120 --> 02:30.440]  which was, this seems like a job
[02:30.440 --> 02:32.440]  that was invented for Renee.
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.120]  In so far as it is something you seem keenly interested in,
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.120]  but also, over the years, I believe that you have befriended
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.340]  in the truest, non-competitive sense,
[02:46.340 --> 02:50.280]  in the way that being on YouTube is not zero-sum, right?
[02:50.280 --> 02:52.760]  I mean, ultimately it is, because there's only 24 hours
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.560]  in a day, you can't watch more than 24 hours
[02:56.560 --> 02:58.240]  of YouTube videos in a day, I guess,
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.720]  unless you speed them up, but you know an awful lot
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.640]  of independent creators on YouTube,
[03:04.640 --> 03:08.240]  for lack of a better word, and they know you, and like you,
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.840]  and now your job is literally to help them?
[03:11.840 --> 03:15.400]  Yeah, so I advocate for creators inside of YouTube,
[03:15.400 --> 03:17.080]  like everyone on YouTube is really pro-creator,
[03:17.080 --> 03:18.320]  that was one of the things that,
[03:18.320 --> 03:19.620]  I can't say it really surprised me,
[03:19.620 --> 03:21.640]  but really like made me happy,
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.720]  was that everyone fiercely thought about creators
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.240]  and prioritized creators, but it's my only job,
[03:27.240 --> 03:30.040]  I don't have anything else to do but advocate for creators,
[03:30.040 --> 03:31.780]  try to build empathy and understanding
[03:31.780 --> 03:33.220]  about what creators go through,
[03:33.220 --> 03:34.400]  all different kinds of creators,
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.600]  because it's not just one kind,
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.600]  there's big and small and marginalized and mainstream,
[03:38.600 --> 03:40.680]  and all across the spectrum of cultural
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.160]  and lifestyle interests, do all of that inside YouTube,
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.360]  but at the same time, try to educate creators
[03:46.360 --> 03:49.120]  outside YouTube so they understand the systems better
[03:49.120 --> 03:51.040]  and can be more successful on the platform,
[03:51.040 --> 03:54.720]  so it's sort of like half ombudsman, half evangelism.
[03:54.720 --> 03:56.760]  Yeah, I guess so, right?
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.800]  I mean, and it's going back to Apple even,
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.640]  the evangelists, sort of like working in dev relations,
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.000]  the equivalent, you know?
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.600]  Yeah, except I get to see things on Twitter
[04:08.600 --> 04:09.560]  and interact with people,
[04:09.560 --> 04:11.840]  which I think is different than Apple's culture,
[04:11.840 --> 04:14.360]  like we don't like, the evangelists at Apple are amazing,
[04:14.360 --> 04:15.880]  but they don't get to interact
[04:15.880 --> 04:18.360]  in a public forum with developers,
[04:18.360 --> 04:21.240]  and I also get to champion them inside
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.160]  and say like, what are we doing here?
[04:22.160 --> 04:23.800]  Why is this happening on Twitter?
[04:23.800 --> 04:24.720]  What is going on?
[04:24.720 --> 04:27.360]  And try to find answers, which I think is fantastic.
[04:28.400 --> 04:30.240]  But you're still making videos.
[04:30.240 --> 04:31.760]  Yes, yeah, so part of the thing was
[04:31.760 --> 04:34.000]  I never wanna not feel the pain of being a creator,
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.480]  because I think that helps with the empathy,
[04:35.480 --> 04:36.720]  and I also wanna make sure if like,
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.560]  it's the same thing with code,
[04:37.560 --> 04:39.920]  like I don't want anyone else to hit the bugs first,
[04:39.920 --> 04:41.080]  that's a terrible experience,
[04:41.080 --> 04:43.480]  so I try to do all the different things that YouTube does
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.640]  so that I can feel the same things
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.000]  that creators are going through.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.040]  Which would be different, it would,
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.880]  again, to stretch the analogy,
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.920]  it would be like if somebody who worked in dev relations
[04:52.920 --> 04:56.400]  at Apple could still be an independent developer somehow,
[04:56.400 --> 04:59.360]  which it doesn't actually, I actually do understand,
[04:59.360 --> 05:01.720]  there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot,
[05:01.720 --> 05:03.480]  actually can't spend too much time
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.920]  going into the app store today, we have time limits,
[05:05.920 --> 05:09.840]  but I understand why that doesn't quite work out.
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.320]  It's interesting to me, though,
[05:11.320 --> 05:13.800]  that it does, that YouTube doesn't see this,
[05:13.800 --> 05:15.760]  and I guess I can kind of see why, right?
[05:15.760 --> 05:18.240]  Like, the idea would be, well, wait a minute,
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.720]  if you're making some kind of app,
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.600]  how do you know it's not Apple's, you know, there's weird,
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.560]  people go to work for a big, it's not just Apple,
[05:25.560 --> 05:28.640]  but you go to work for one of these big companies,
[05:28.640 --> 05:32.160]  your employment contract often says something
[05:32.160 --> 05:33.920]  to the effect of, you know,
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.440]  it's just best not to work on other software.
[05:37.440 --> 05:40.920]  Whereas your video, your independent video creations,
[05:40.920 --> 05:43.080]  there's no reason why YouTube would have any claim,
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.840]  or even want claim to them, right?
[05:44.840 --> 05:48.480]  YouTube itself, you know, has no interest in owning them,
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.400]  as opposed to some sort of clever utility for iOS,
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.240]  or something like that, where you could see the conflict,
[05:54.240 --> 05:56.120]  and you don't want to blur any lines.
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.280]  This sort of is perfect?
[05:58.280 --> 06:00.840]  Yeah, it's like, I did have to, like, change my channel,
[06:00.840 --> 06:02.080]  like, in a non-insignificant way,
[06:02.080 --> 06:03.360]  because I was just doing complete, like,
[06:03.360 --> 06:05.520]  Apple product coverage, and a lot of rumors and things,
[06:05.520 --> 06:07.160]  and now I work inside Google,
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.480]  I have a lot of information inside Google,
[06:08.480 --> 06:11.200]  so it's not fair, sort of, for me to do that kind of stuff,
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.160]  so I try to do more video essays,
[06:13.160 --> 06:15.200]  and also, it wouldn't be fair if I had access to things
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.360]  that weren't available, at least in public betas,
[06:17.360 --> 06:20.080]  so we're all very careful to make sure that,
[06:20.080 --> 06:21.240]  like, I'm running it in a way
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.280]  that doesn't touch anything that Google does,
[06:23.280 --> 06:25.360]  which is hard, because Google does so many things,
[06:25.360 --> 06:27.200]  but also doesn't have access to anything
[06:27.200 --> 06:29.720]  that a standard creator wouldn't have access to.
[06:29.720 --> 06:31.800]  Hmm, I getcha, I getcha.
[06:31.800 --> 06:33.840]  And so, anyway, here we are at the end of the year,
[06:33.840 --> 06:34.800]  it's going well?
[06:34.800 --> 06:36.160]  Yeah, yeah, it's fantastic,
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.480]  it's the best thing I've ever done.
[06:37.480 --> 06:39.000]  Like, I get to finish almost every day
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.360]  knowing that I helped creators,
[06:40.360 --> 06:41.640]  especially marginalized creators,
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.920]  and, like, in pretty amazing ways.
[06:43.920 --> 06:44.760]  That's pretty good.
[06:44.760 --> 06:48.240]  All right, before we dig into actual news, Apple Front,
[06:48.240 --> 06:50.360]  let's start with a thank you
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.960]  to one of our sponsors here on my show,
[06:52.960 --> 06:56.360]  and speaking of independent creators, it is Memberful.
[06:56.360 --> 06:59.120]  You can monetize your passion with memberships.
[06:59.120 --> 07:02.040]  Memberful allows you, a creative individual,
[07:02.040 --> 07:04.560]  to build a sustainable, recurring revenue.
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.480]  It is the easiest way to sell memberships to your audience,
[07:07.480 --> 07:10.480]  used by some of the biggest creators on the web,
[07:10.480 --> 07:14.280]  and it is, as I like to say, win, win, win.
[07:14.280 --> 07:16.920]  It is a great system for you,
[07:16.920 --> 07:18.040]  this is who they're pitching it to,
[07:18.040 --> 07:21.000]  somebody who is creative and has some kind of audience
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.880]  that you're hoping to monetize or monetize better or more,
[07:23.880 --> 07:27.720]  or just add another leg to your monetization stool,
[07:27.720 --> 07:28.760]  as it were.
[07:28.760 --> 07:31.200]  It is great for your audience.
[07:31.200 --> 07:34.680]  Everybody loves, everybody who wants to support somebody
[07:34.680 --> 07:36.240]  who's going through Memberful,
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.000]  the experience is just terrific.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  Every single aspect from the signup and the cancellation,
[07:43.080 --> 07:45.720]  if you do wanna cancel a subscription or a membership
[07:45.720 --> 07:47.560]  or something like that, no strings attached,
[07:47.560 --> 07:50.120]  it is easy, it is, and it supplies,
[07:50.120 --> 07:53.440]  it provides all sorts of great features
[07:53.440 --> 07:56.560]  from the creator who is hosting the Memberful system
[07:56.560 --> 07:58.920]  to the users, and it's great for Memberful,
[07:58.920 --> 08:02.480]  because Memberful only succeeds when you succeed
[08:02.480 --> 08:05.520]  and keep people happy and keep them subscribed
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.360]  to your membership thing.
[08:06.360 --> 08:09.000]  That's all they're in it for, is to keep people happy.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.520]  And they have everything you need,
[08:10.520 --> 08:12.720]  from custom branding, gift subscriptions,
[08:12.720 --> 08:14.720]  Apple Pay, free trials,
[08:14.720 --> 08:17.760]  private podcasts that you can host just for your members.
[08:17.760 --> 08:19.500]  They take care of all the technical stuff
[08:19.500 --> 08:21.580]  to make sure that that stuff remains private,
[08:21.580 --> 08:24.180]  the private goodies just for your paying members,
[08:24.180 --> 08:25.800]  and tons more.
[08:25.800 --> 08:28.600]  And you keep full control and ownership,
[08:28.600 --> 08:30.640]  not just of your audience and the list,
[08:30.640 --> 08:32.320]  which you could take with you at any time
[08:32.320 --> 08:34.480]  if you do choose to leave, but your brand.
[08:34.480 --> 08:38.280]  Your brand stays front and foremost with Memberful.
[08:38.280 --> 08:42.800]  People may not even, your users, your audience,
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.800]  they may not even know they're going through Memberful
[08:44.800 --> 08:47.420]  because your brand stays right at the forefront.

[08:49.400 --> 08:52.360]  who is willing to help you simplify your memberships,
[08:52.360 --> 08:54.840]  help you strategize what type of things to offer,
[08:54.840 --> 08:56.520]  how much to charge, stuff like that.

[08:58.360 --> 09:00.720]  because they only succeed when you succeed.

[09:03.000 --> 09:06.960]  see everything they have to offer with no credit card required.
[09:06.960 --> 09:09.000]  Where do you go to do this?
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.760]  You go to memberful.com slash talk show.
[09:12.760 --> 09:16.160]  Go to memberful.com slash talk show today.
[09:16.160 --> 09:18.280]  Monetize your audience with memberships.
[09:18.280 --> 09:19.740]  Let's get the news out of the way.
[09:19.740 --> 09:24.080]  I would say, let's just go least pleasant to most pleasant.
[09:24.080 --> 09:28.320]  And I've spent a lot of time writing about Twitter
[09:28.320 --> 09:29.160]  this month.
[09:29.160 --> 09:33.200]  I had, I think, a very good interview with Anil Dash
[09:33.200 --> 09:35.440]  an episode or two ago here on the show,
[09:35.440 --> 09:40.080]  which the backstory on that is that things are moving
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.080]  so fast at Twitter under Elon Musk that usually I have
[09:46.040 --> 09:49.600]  about a 36, 48 hour turnaround here between recording
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.400]  and publishing episodes, sometimes closer to 24 hours,
[09:53.400 --> 09:54.800]  sometimes closer to 48.
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.800]  So much had happened after Anil and I record,
[09:59.880 --> 10:01.400]  I thought it went really well.
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.240]  And I was really keen on having a guest who was skeptical,
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.880]  deep to say the least, that's almost putting it kindly,
[10:08.880 --> 10:12.480]  skeptical of Elon Musk back in April when it was first
[10:12.480 --> 10:14.120]  announced that he would buy Twitter
[10:14.120 --> 10:17.660]  because I was publicly optimistic.
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.920]  And so I wanted somebody who would push me on that
[10:20.920 --> 10:23.920]  because I was turning, I was like, hmm,
[10:23.920 --> 10:25.600]  it looks like this might be one of those cases
[10:25.600 --> 10:28.160]  where I get to apply my, the way to be right all the time
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.680]  is to admit when you're wrong.
[10:29.680 --> 10:30.680]  Yes.
[10:30.680 --> 10:34.520]  And Anil was excellent and really made a lot of keen points.
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.080]  Further changed my mind during the interview,
[10:37.080 --> 10:39.240]  which is always, to me, very exciting.
[10:39.240 --> 10:41.760]  I find it very exciting to change my mind.
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.560]  And I got worried after we recorded because all of a sudden
[10:45.560 --> 10:46.840]  more stuff started happening.
[10:46.840 --> 10:49.900]  And I was like, is this even gonna be relevant?
[10:49.900 --> 10:54.640]  And it was literally the weekend where he laid off
[10:56.080 --> 10:58.600]  three quarters, two thirds, whatever, of their staff
[10:58.600 --> 11:02.040]  and then additional people started resigning
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.700]  and there was speculation, there were quotes in the press
[11:05.700 --> 11:07.560]  from people who said that there were teams
[11:07.560 --> 11:09.840]  that Twitter could not function without
[11:09.840 --> 11:12.600]  who were down to zero headcount.
[11:12.600 --> 11:15.340]  And so if it were true that Twitter couldn't function
[11:15.340 --> 11:17.880]  without them, that the whole site might collapse,
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.840]  which didn't happen, but it was a stressful 36 hours
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.200]  because I was like, I want this episode out, it was good.
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.760]  I don't have much more to say about that.
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.080]  I will say though that in the last 24 hours as we record,
[11:30.080 --> 11:33.240]  Twitter instituted an official policy,
[11:33.240 --> 11:35.560]  including an official help page,
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.560]  banning the inclusion of links to about, I don't know,
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.160]  half a dozen, a dozen other social media sites.
[11:43.160 --> 11:45.640]  It's funny what was included on the list and what wasn't.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.160]  It was like Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon,
[11:48.160 --> 11:50.960]  which I think was the one that was under Elon Musk's skin.
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.200]  Truth Social for some reason, but not LinkedIn and not,
[11:55.200 --> 11:58.560]  I forget what else, or Tumblr, well, yeah, not YouTube.
[11:58.560 --> 12:01.920]  But YouTube would certainly make sense, I think,
[12:01.920 --> 12:03.960]  because I really, I don't know.
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.800]  It's-
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.360]  Notor was there too, which upset Jack.
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.440]  Yes.
[12:08.440 --> 12:12.120]  Well, that seemed like it was just for Jack, right?
[12:12.120 --> 12:12.960]  Yeah.
[12:12.960 --> 12:13.780]  What's it called?
[12:13.780 --> 12:14.620]  Nostr?
[12:14.620 --> 12:17.120]  I don't know, there's too few letters
[12:17.120 --> 12:18.720]  left in too many acronyms.
[12:18.720 --> 12:20.300]  Yeah, I don't understand it.
[12:20.300 --> 12:22.240]  I looked into it when I saw Jack was into it.
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.480]  Nostr, it's N-O-S-T-R, so it's sort of a 20,
[12:26.480 --> 12:29.360]  sort of like a, I guess, maybe?
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.720]  It's like, well, I don't know though
[12:30.720 --> 12:32.840]  that it's about predictions, but I looked into it
[12:32.840 --> 12:34.700]  and it's not something you can sign up for.
[12:34.700 --> 12:38.360]  It's like some kind of, it's way more nascent and nerdy
[12:38.360 --> 12:40.220]  and you run it and generate, I don't know.
[12:40.220 --> 12:42.720]  It's more cryptographically inclined.
[12:42.720 --> 12:45.680]  But not Hive, it was a real Smorgasbord tree,
[12:45.680 --> 12:48.520]  a real Smorgasbord of random names.
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.680]  Yeah, well, Hive is the one that exploded in popularity,
[12:51.680 --> 12:54.720]  but then had sort of had to shut down for a bit
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.440]  because they were so in over their heads.
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.040]  And again, it doesn't seem like they were incompetent.
[12:59.040 --> 13:02.080]  It just seems like a three-person project
[13:02.080 --> 13:05.620]  exploded in popularity for reasons, you know, nobody can,
[13:05.620 --> 13:08.840]  you never know when something's gonna blow up like that.
[13:08.840 --> 13:12.760]  Post seems more, post.news is the name
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.160]  of the social network.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.840]  Right now, they're web-only.
[13:15.840 --> 13:17.940]  I honestly don't see the appeal,
[13:18.900 --> 13:22.040]  but maybe it's because it's designed
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.020]  for people who are unlike me.
[13:24.020 --> 13:29.080]  It seems to be drawn up to draw journalists,
[13:29.080 --> 13:31.600]  for lack of a better word, media personalities,
[13:31.600 --> 13:33.640]  which you would think I would be included in,
[13:33.640 --> 13:36.120]  but I just don't see the appeal of it.
[13:36.120 --> 13:39.040]  But because it's going after media people
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.320]  and Elon Musk is obsessed, clearly,
[13:41.320 --> 13:43.800]  whether you love him or hate him or are ambivalent,
[13:43.800 --> 13:47.440]  he's clearly interested in publicity and attention.
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.080]  Therefore, a network specifically geared towards people
[13:51.080 --> 13:52.920]  in a position of media influence
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.640]  is clearly gonna catch his attention.
[13:54.640 --> 13:55.600]  And this was all, by the way,
[13:55.600 --> 13:57.200]  during the World Cup finale
[13:57.200 --> 13:59.260]  where attention became incredibly divided.
[14:00.240 --> 14:01.080]  Right?
[14:01.080 --> 14:02.040]  And he was there, alive,
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.160]  like he's coordinating a less well,
[14:03.160 --> 14:05.880]  sitting there in the box, watching the match.
[14:05.880 --> 14:09.880]  Right, in Qatar with a friend of the show, Jared Kushner.
[14:09.880 --> 14:11.760]  Jared and the homies.
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.680]  Yeah, and by late last night,
[14:14.680 --> 14:16.160]  the whole policy had been rescinded.
[14:16.160 --> 14:18.280]  The help page was a 404,
[14:18.280 --> 14:20.160]  and I guess it's a big nevermind.
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.040]  I'm not quite sure if they've taken,
[14:22.040 --> 14:23.100]  I haven't even tried it yet,
[14:23.100 --> 14:25.160]  if they have taken out the filters,
[14:25.160 --> 14:28.100]  the ham-fisted filters they've applied
[14:28.100 --> 14:30.880]  to keep you from linking to your Mastodon account
[14:30.880 --> 14:32.140]  in your Twitter bio.
[14:32.140 --> 14:34.380]  I don't know if they've taken those out yet or not.
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.640]  Who knows what's going on?
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.980]  I'm just kidding.
[14:36.980 --> 14:39.120]  My favorite was the quick journey of Paul Graham,
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.120]  where he went from,
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.720]  people who aren't CEOs of companies
[14:41.720 --> 14:43.680]  shouldn't be telling Elon how to run this company,
[14:43.680 --> 14:45.460]  to this is it, my last straw, I've had it,
[14:45.460 --> 14:46.720]  I'm leaving from Mastodon,
[14:46.720 --> 14:48.820]  to Paul Graham is banned.
[14:48.820 --> 14:50.980]  I sympathize with Paul Graham, though,
[14:50.980 --> 14:53.520]  because I feel like while his initial tweet
[14:53.520 --> 14:56.520]  that he's getting dunked on from, I don't know,
[14:56.520 --> 14:58.480]  a long, long couple of weeks ago
[14:58.480 --> 15:00.620]  where he said people who haven't been in this position
[15:00.620 --> 15:02.440]  shouldn't criticize, you know,
[15:02.440 --> 15:05.120]  he's run Rocket and electric car companies,
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.400]  that's harder to now being, you know, yesterday,
[15:07.400 --> 15:09.920]  while that, now the link policy has been rescinded,
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.280]  so, you know, and Paul Graham did not close or shutter
[15:13.280 --> 15:14.640]  or delete his Twitter account,
[15:14.640 --> 15:16.580]  he just said I'm just gonna stop using it
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.560]  if this nonsense stays in policy.
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.520]  Well, I, you know, it is funny, it is a journey,
[15:21.520 --> 15:25.320]  it definitely fits the meme of how things started,
[15:25.320 --> 15:26.640]  how they're going, right,
[15:26.640 --> 15:29.600]  which is an evergreen format.
[15:29.600 --> 15:30.440]  There were a couple of these,
[15:30.440 --> 15:31.280]  like the other one that,
[15:31.280 --> 15:32.720]  well, the two others really stuck out to me,
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.640]  one was a YouTuber, like a,
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.120]  I would say like a right-leaning YouTuber,
[15:37.120 --> 15:39.320]  somebody who's clearly in Elon Musk's,
[15:39.320 --> 15:41.160]  like, wheelhouse right now,
[15:41.160 --> 15:43.000]  said this is bad because I wanna link,
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.200]  I wanna use my link tree to connect to my YouTube
[15:46.200 --> 15:48.220]  and to my coffee products and all this,
[15:48.220 --> 15:49.800]  and Elon was like, oh yeah, that's a good idea,
[15:49.800 --> 15:51.440]  so from now on we'll change it,
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.720]  and it's just like that feedback loop to me is astonishing,
[15:55.720 --> 15:58.320]  and then Jimmy, MrBeast, tweeted,
[15:58.320 --> 15:59.760]  like Elon put up this, we'll get to this,
[15:59.760 --> 16:01.880]  Elon put up this poll about whether we should stay or not,
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.080]  and Jimmy's like,
[16:03.080 --> 16:04.880]  if you keep doing harebrained stuff like this,
[16:04.880 --> 16:06.760]  no, with a barf emoji,
[16:06.760 --> 16:09.120]  and usually when you push back on Elon,
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.600]  his fans flood you,
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.840]  like I've done three videos on Twitter,
[16:12.840 --> 16:14.720]  same like you've been covering it in your podcast,
[16:14.720 --> 16:17.640]  I never got that much hate for covering Zuckerberg,
[16:17.640 --> 16:19.960]  covering Google, covering Apple,
[16:19.960 --> 16:21.280]  covering any other company's things
[16:21.280 --> 16:24.360]  that I thought were not like examples of good management,
[16:24.360 --> 16:27.440]  I got destroyed on all of those videos,
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.240]  and Jimmy is the first time I've seen someone
[16:29.240 --> 16:31.200]  respond to Elon in a negative way
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.200]  where the fandom did not know how to react,
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.720]  and we're kind of like,
[16:35.720 --> 16:38.280]  but Jimmy, Jimmy, please, let us just explain it to you.
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.040]  So yeah, I guess where we stand as we record,
[16:41.040 --> 16:43.160]  God only knows where things will stand
[16:43.160 --> 16:44.920]  by the time this episode drops,
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.840]  or where we'll be the light,
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.680]  the epochs from now that the end of the year is,
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.680]  but as of yesterday's cliffhanger episode
[16:56.880 --> 16:58.880]  of the Elon Musk show,
[16:58.880 --> 17:01.200]  he had commissioned, or not commissioned,
[17:01.200 --> 17:03.120]  but put up a Twitter poll for 12 hours,
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.440]  should he stay or step down as CEO,
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.440]  and the 57% to 43% said he should step down,
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.760]  and he said, I would abide by the poll,
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.040]  who knows, but we shall see.
[17:15.040 --> 17:16.540]  It's hard to see, like it's hard,
[17:16.540 --> 17:19.280]  because unless he sells a controlling stake
[17:19.280 --> 17:21.640]  and deletes the app from his phone, frankly,
[17:21.640 --> 17:22.740]  he will still own it,
[17:22.740 --> 17:25.600]  and whoever runs it will be beholden to him,
[17:25.600 --> 17:28.040]  or the other prediction is that he wants out
[17:28.040 --> 17:29.440]  Tesla's underperforming,
[17:30.480 --> 17:32.200]  he's not responsible to shareholders at Twitter,
[17:32.200 --> 17:33.760]  but he certainly is at Tesla,
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.880]  and that this could be a sort of a graceful,
[17:35.880 --> 17:37.560]  meme-y way of getting out of it.
[17:38.800 --> 17:41.460]  I guess, you know, if he's like done having fun,
[17:41.460 --> 17:42.520]  and he's like, you know.
[17:42.520 --> 17:43.360]  It's not worth it.
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.160]  I do, you know, at least,
[17:46.160 --> 17:47.800]  at this point, it is a stretch
[17:47.800 --> 17:49.680]  coming up with positive things.
[17:49.680 --> 17:51.520]  To say the least, it is a stretch
[17:51.520 --> 17:53.680]  to come up with positive things to say
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.000]  about Elon Musk and his stewardship as owner of Twitter.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  But one of them, at least,
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.700]  is that he does change his mind.
[18:03.700 --> 18:06.440]  I mean, his frequent changes of mind
[18:06.440 --> 18:08.400]  are part of the problem,
[18:08.400 --> 18:10.240]  but at least he's,
[18:10.240 --> 18:14.880]  it's not like he came in with a list of four things,
[18:14.880 --> 18:17.960]  and hasn't added to the list,
[18:17.960 --> 18:19.720]  or crossed some items off the list,
[18:19.720 --> 18:21.080]  and said nevermind, right?
[18:21.080 --> 18:22.600]  So, who knows?
[18:22.600 --> 18:24.120]  But I don't really see how,
[18:24.120 --> 18:26.040]  as so long as he owns it,
[18:26.040 --> 18:27.680]  I don't really see how this poll,
[18:27.680 --> 18:29.240]  like, it's exactly what you said.
[18:29.240 --> 18:30.440]  He can hire somebody,
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.040]  he can give them the title CEO,
[18:33.040 --> 18:34.800]  but as a privately held company,
[18:34.800 --> 18:36.560]  they would clearly answer to him.
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.680]  So, he is the de facto head of Twitter
[18:40.680 --> 18:41.820]  so long as he owns it,
[18:41.820 --> 18:44.840]  and good luck selling it, at this point,
[18:44.840 --> 18:46.760]  at anything, I mean, he could sell it,
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.440]  but he couldn't sell it at anything near what he paid for.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.480]  Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[18:51.480 --> 18:52.560]  It is interesting,
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.340]  because you see all these different takes on it.
[18:54.340 --> 18:55.920]  My usual take is when everyone talks,
[18:55.920 --> 18:57.920]  when anyone talks about free speech on the internet,
[18:57.920 --> 19:01.560]  is that it is never as simple as just saying it.
[19:01.560 --> 19:02.920]  Like, just saying it out loud,
[19:02.920 --> 19:03.940]  there was this wonderful thread,
[19:03.940 --> 19:04.780]  I'm sure you saw it,
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.400]  from one of the founders of Reddit,
[19:06.400 --> 19:07.480]  who just basically said,
[19:07.480 --> 19:08.580]  we just wanna make good features,
[19:08.580 --> 19:10.400]  but you humans are horrible to each other.
[19:10.400 --> 19:11.880]  We have to stop all the time
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.640]  just to fix all the human crap that's going on,
[19:13.640 --> 19:15.800]  and we can never get the features we want done.
[19:15.800 --> 19:17.440]  And I thought it was just showing
[19:17.440 --> 19:19.720]  how these things inevitably fall into chaos,
[19:19.720 --> 19:22.120]  and that was really instructive to me,
[19:22.120 --> 19:23.160]  because I think one of the things
[19:23.160 --> 19:25.740]  that Elon is really good at is the attention economy,
[19:25.740 --> 19:28.320]  but at a certain point, you have to ask yourself,
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.400]  is all attention equally valuable?
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.200]  And this is something YouTube went through as well.
[19:32.200 --> 19:33.300]  Like, at a certain point,
[19:33.300 --> 19:34.720]  it was all about click-through rates,
[19:34.720 --> 19:37.200]  so people had these really click-baity thumbnails,
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.800]  and then it was all about watch time,
[19:38.800 --> 19:40.920]  so people would do increasingly sensational things
[19:40.920 --> 19:41.980]  just to hold your attention,
[19:41.980 --> 19:43.760]  and some of those things were incredibly negative,
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.040]  because people will rubberneck,
[19:45.040 --> 19:47.440]  will stop, will look at accidents,
[19:47.440 --> 19:48.640]  but it wasn't a good feeling.
[19:48.640 --> 19:50.480]  Like, it wasn't a healthy feeling,
[19:50.480 --> 19:52.680]  so it shifted to figuring out
[19:52.680 --> 19:54.140]  there were different kinds of watch time.
[19:54.140 --> 19:55.480]  There was some watch time you felt good about,
[19:55.480 --> 19:56.560]  that was satisfying,
[19:56.560 --> 19:58.000]  and some that you felt really bad about,
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.300]  and they changed the entire way the system works
[20:00.300 --> 20:03.780]  to prioritize satisfaction rather than just engagement,
[20:03.780 --> 20:05.360]  and to me, I think that was a sea change
[20:05.360 --> 20:08.720]  in just how algorithms approach people being more human,
[20:08.720 --> 20:10.520]  and I think the risk that we have right now in Twitter
[20:10.520 --> 20:13.680]  is that the attention right now is attention at any cost,
[20:13.680 --> 20:15.680]  and a lot of it is profoundly negative,
[20:15.680 --> 20:17.600]  and that just has, at least for me,
[20:17.600 --> 20:20.040]  like, I don't feel like using Twitter the way I used to,
[20:20.040 --> 20:21.620]  and I used to use Twitter a lot,
[20:21.620 --> 20:22.600]  and I just, I look there,
[20:22.600 --> 20:24.240]  and it feels like I'm in the middle of an accident,
[20:24.240 --> 20:25.560]  and I just back away every day.
[20:25.560 --> 20:27.080]  Yeah, I'm curious.
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.160]  It doesn't seem like you've set up shop on Mastodon yet?
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.800]  I did, I set up an account.
[20:32.800 --> 20:34.700]  When Melton did, I just copied whatever he did,
[20:34.700 --> 20:35.540]  so I have an account.
[20:35.540 --> 20:37.000]  I think I follow one person,
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.680]  and I don't think I've ever used it yet,
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.700]  but I got to the point where, like,
[20:40.700 --> 20:43.960]  people will take my username if I don't go pretty fast,
[20:43.960 --> 20:45.640]  so I've set up as many things as I can
[20:45.640 --> 20:48.400]  just to keep the username in case I ever need it.
[20:48.400 --> 20:51.600]  Yeah, that's part of the problem, though, with Mastodon,
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.400]  and I'm warming up to it,
[20:53.400 --> 20:56.240]  and I've actually broken the seal and started using mine.
[20:56.240 --> 20:59.340]  I don't know how much, you know, it certainly is a,
[21:00.340 --> 21:02.800]  I would like to have at least one Twitter-like thing
[21:02.800 --> 21:05.400]  in my life, whether it's Twitter or Mastodon,
[21:05.400 --> 21:07.420]  but I don't know that I,
[21:07.420 --> 21:10.980]  having two is an interesting, for me, personally,
[21:10.980 --> 21:15.080]  is an interesting psychological test
[21:15.080 --> 21:16.640]  because it's sort of,
[21:17.960 --> 21:18.880]  I was thinking about it
[21:18.880 --> 21:20.560]  while I was out running errands the other day.
[21:20.560 --> 21:23.380]  That's, you know, my two places for wandering thoughts.
[21:23.380 --> 21:25.800]  The shower and a walk, but I was walking,
[21:25.800 --> 21:26.720]  and I was thinking about it.
[21:26.720 --> 21:31.440]  There's an old axiom that I really believe in about design,
[21:31.440 --> 21:33.800]  and it's the design of anything,
[21:33.800 --> 21:36.360]  a product, software, hardware,
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.780]  how many brands of mustard to stock in your supermarket,
[21:40.780 --> 21:43.520]  how many brands of ketchup, how many, you know,
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.720]  that when you give people a choice,
[21:47.720 --> 21:52.080]  there's always an implicit extra choice,
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.200]  which is not to choose at all.
[21:54.200 --> 21:58.680]  And it's counterintuitive because it's,
[21:58.680 --> 22:03.680]  we're wired to think having a choice is always better.
[22:03.680 --> 22:05.200]  Certainly having a choice is better
[22:05.200 --> 22:06.520]  than having no choice at all,
[22:06.520 --> 22:08.660]  and in many cases, that is true,
[22:08.660 --> 22:12.120]  but it's one of those, there's two sides to every coin,
[22:12.120 --> 22:14.660]  and there are cases where having too many choices
[22:14.660 --> 22:19.380]  is too much, and there is a weird difference for me
[22:19.380 --> 22:24.380]  that all of a sudden, my combined stuff
[22:25.520 --> 22:29.840]  I would like to see on a Twitter-like experience is now,
[22:29.840 --> 22:32.600]  and it's permanently split between Twitter and Mastodon
[22:32.600 --> 22:35.440]  to some degree, because some number of people
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.360]  who I definitely enjoy following
[22:37.360 --> 22:40.200]  and have followed on Twitter for over a decade
[22:41.280 --> 22:43.480]  have moved permanently to Mastodon,
[22:43.480 --> 22:44.320]  but I also see those-
[22:44.320 --> 22:45.200]  All our original friends have left.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.100]  Like, I miss them dearly.
[22:46.100 --> 22:47.120]  I don't see their tweets anymore,
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.600]  and I really do miss them.
[22:48.600 --> 22:52.240]  And it does make looking at my Mastodon timeline
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.980]  enjoyable in a retro way where it's like,
[22:54.980 --> 22:58.740]  hey, this sort of feels like Twitter circa 2009, right?
[22:58.740 --> 23:03.740]  Like, early years of, like, to me, the Twitter,
[23:03.740 --> 23:06.240]  as I'm using Mastodon, Twitter,
[23:06.240 --> 23:08.760]  or as I'm using Mastodon today,
[23:09.760 --> 23:13.840]  I can recall the feelings of using
[23:13.840 --> 23:17.520]  the very early Twitter-ific on a very-
[23:17.520 --> 23:19.240]  Ashton Kutcher Twitter is what it is to me.
[23:19.240 --> 23:20.440]  Right.
[23:20.440 --> 23:22.840]  The very early iPhones, you know,
[23:22.840 --> 23:26.440]  with the lickable interfaces and everything's a little 3D.
[23:26.440 --> 23:28.140]  Or it went mainstream.
[23:28.140 --> 23:30.080]  And it just feels like that.
[23:30.080 --> 23:32.160]  And it's because it's the same people,
[23:32.160 --> 23:35.220]  it is sort of an early adopter enthusiast crowd.
[23:35.220 --> 23:37.280]  I mean, there's a million, there's like 10 million people,
[23:37.280 --> 23:38.480]  I believe, now on Mastodon.
[23:38.480 --> 23:39.600]  I don't know how many are active.
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.760]  So it's not a tiny, tiny sliver.
[23:41.760 --> 23:44.520]  It's not a tiny, niche, like,
[23:44.520 --> 23:47.260]  just people who listen, like, to my show, right?
[23:47.260 --> 23:50.240]  It's not like, oh, it's just people who are super nerdy
[23:50.240 --> 23:52.400]  and know how to program or something like that.
[23:52.400 --> 23:54.600]  It's definitely broader than that.
[23:54.600 --> 23:59.600]  But it is definitely also nowhere near mass market
[23:59.840 --> 24:00.680]  in terms of its appeal.
[24:00.680 --> 24:02.480]  It's like old Mac world vibe.
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.880]  Right, and I do like that.
[24:04.880 --> 24:06.960]  But it's weird, though, because now,
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.240]  when I want to satisfy my read something vaguely,
[24:11.240 --> 24:12.880]  like Twitter, I've got to choose
[24:12.880 --> 24:16.680]  which icon to tap on my phone.
[24:16.680 --> 24:21.680]  And that is, so I see, and I know a lot of the people
[24:21.940 --> 24:24.160]  who have said, look, I am done with Twitter.
[24:24.160 --> 24:26.720]  Either they, like, maybe they even shuttered their account,
[24:26.720 --> 24:29.720]  but they at least are, they're not cross-posting,
[24:29.720 --> 24:31.600]  they're not splitting their time between the two.
[24:31.600 --> 24:33.960]  They're like, I'm done with this guy, he's in that job.
[24:33.960 --> 24:36.420]  Twitter's been shitty for a while anyway.
[24:36.420 --> 24:38.700]  I'm all in on Mastodon.
[24:38.700 --> 24:40.120]  I get why people do that.
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.060]  It's the split that is, to me, very difficult.
[24:43.060 --> 24:45.360]  And in a way, that's sort of,
[24:45.360 --> 24:47.160]  also, lessons I've been thinking about
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.260]  is it's like new things that popped up post-Twitter,
[24:51.260 --> 24:54.000]  and Instagram would be the most obvious.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.120]  Even though Instagram's been around so long now, too,
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.040]  it's hard to remember that Instagram was a,
[25:00.040 --> 25:02.920]  not a Twitter clone, but had obviously
[25:02.920 --> 25:04.440]  learned lessons from Twitter.
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.440]  And famously, when Instagram launched,
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.260]  Twitter still had API access to your follower graph.
[25:12.260 --> 25:13.580]  I don't know why they call it a graph,
[25:13.580 --> 25:15.640]  but that's the lingo.
[25:15.640 --> 25:19.960]  But Instagram, in the very early days,
[25:19.960 --> 25:22.280]  like those days when it was iPhone only,
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.280]  largely bootstrapped off people's Twitter follower
[25:27.360 --> 25:29.120]  and connection graph, right?
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.820]  You could go into Instagram and connect it to your Twitter,
[25:31.820 --> 25:34.240]  and it would find the people, oh,
[25:34.240 --> 25:36.140]  if all these people who follow you,
[25:36.140 --> 25:38.060]  or you follow or follow you on Twitter,
[25:38.060 --> 25:40.040]  we can connect you up on Instagram,
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.760]  and all of a sudden, you're up and running,
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.120]  and it's largely the same people.
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.420]  But it made sense, conceptually, that I wanted to use both,
[25:47.420 --> 25:49.920]  because what you posted to the two things,
[25:49.920 --> 25:52.260]  and what other people posted were so different,
[25:52.260 --> 25:54.560]  especially in the early days of Instagram,
[25:54.560 --> 25:56.080]  when it was super, super clear
[25:56.080 --> 25:58.360]  that not only did you only post photos,
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.120]  you only posted square photos.
[26:00.120 --> 26:02.060]  Yeah, and photos from mobile you got made fun of
[26:02.060 --> 26:04.760]  if you posted a DSLR photo or something.
[26:04.760 --> 26:07.480]  Right, right, it was sort of an unofficial part of the,
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.080]  not rules, but the sportsman-like conduct
[26:11.080 --> 26:13.280]  was that you were supposed to be taking photos
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.160]  with your phone, and the phones were so crummy,
[26:17.160 --> 26:21.280]  circa 2010, 2011, and that's why they had those filters
[26:21.280 --> 26:24.040]  that people have, I'm sure, largely forgotten,
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.320]  but these overzealous photo filters
[26:28.320 --> 26:31.440]  to make your phone images look like they were shot
[26:31.440 --> 26:36.040]  on 30-year-old film stock with,
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.440]  replete with grungy details like corners of the image
[26:40.440 --> 26:45.040]  that looked like the over-scanned film
[26:45.040 --> 26:46.880]  on a flatbed scanner, and that sort of thing.
[26:46.880 --> 26:48.520]  To justify the badness.
[26:48.520 --> 26:50.220]  Right, but it was brilliant, though,
[26:50.220 --> 26:52.040]  because it actually did make the photos,
[26:52.040 --> 26:55.120]  it was gimmicky, and I think that they were keenly aware
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.160]  of it and backed away at just the right time,
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.040]  and said, you know what, we don't need to do this anymore,
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.560]  but at the time, it made photos
[27:01.560 --> 27:05.400]  that coming right off the camera roll on your phone,
[27:05.400 --> 27:07.640]  which were kind of flat and looked like,
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.240]  I mean, we don't really talk about cell phone photos anymore
[27:11.240 --> 27:14.240]  but at the time, we were in this transition era
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.680]  between when our phones took better pictures
[27:16.680 --> 27:18.940]  than most point-and-shoot cameras to,
[27:20.200 --> 27:24.000]  from when they know, it kind of looks like a $5 component
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.040]  that just got added on on the back of your phone.
[27:26.040 --> 27:27.940]  Pre-iPhone 4, there were no such thing as selfies.
[27:27.940 --> 27:29.120]  I mean, the world changes rapidly.
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.480]  Right, right, right, we had no front-facing camera.
[27:31.480 --> 27:33.040]  Can you imagine selling, I mean,
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.640]  it's just, I don't know what's more amazing,
[27:35.640 --> 27:38.360]  that the original iPhone didn't shoot any video at all,
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.960]  let alone bad video, or that it didn't have
[27:40.960 --> 27:44.320]  a front-facing camera until, what was it, the iPhone 4?
[27:44.320 --> 27:45.560]  Is that right?
[27:45.560 --> 27:47.640]  That sounds about, so there were three generations
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.000]  of iPhone that had no front-facing camera,
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.720]  which didn't seem weird, honestly.
[27:52.720 --> 27:54.720]  I remember when the front-facing camera came out
[27:54.720 --> 27:58.280]  and thought, ah, you know, I guess I'll use it once.
[27:58.280 --> 27:59.660]  I don't know.
[27:59.660 --> 28:01.400]  And then, yeah, and then he made calls.
[28:01.400 --> 28:02.360]  The interesting thing for me, though,
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.040]  is I've been traveling a lot for my new job,
[28:04.040 --> 28:06.400]  and one of the parts is I meet a lot of creators,
[28:06.400 --> 28:07.800]  and I would typically, they would say,
[28:07.800 --> 28:08.920]  how do I get in contact with you?
[28:08.920 --> 28:09.800]  And I would say, Twitter.
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.080]  And I increasingly noticed that especially women creators,
[28:13.080 --> 28:16.580]  black creators, LGBTQ creators,
[28:16.580 --> 28:17.940]  they were just either never on Twitter
[28:17.940 --> 28:21.200]  or had got harassed off of Twitter years ago,
[28:21.200 --> 28:23.440]  and we're all mostly on Instagram now.
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.640]  It had become like a real community for them
[28:25.640 --> 28:27.100]  where they could participate with people
[28:27.100 --> 28:29.160]  that didn't make them feel just horrible every day,
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.920]  and that was sort of really eye-opening for me.
[28:31.920 --> 28:34.880]  So I sort of like, now I try to be in all those places
[28:34.880 --> 28:37.440]  because I know there's very different people there.
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.160]  Yeah, it's funny to sing the praises of a Facebook company,
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.640]  but I do think that they,
[28:46.640 --> 28:48.280]  certainly Instagram is their product
[28:48.280 --> 28:49.440]  that I'm the most familiar with
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.580]  because it's the one I'm active on,
[28:50.580 --> 28:53.880]  but I have many complaints about Instagram,
[28:53.880 --> 28:56.640]  and I'm sure that the people who are at Meta
[28:56.640 --> 28:58.880]  working on Instagram are so ever,
[28:58.880 --> 29:00.640]  I don't think anybody's more thankful
[29:00.640 --> 29:03.400]  that Elon Musk bought Twitter than them
[29:03.400 --> 29:08.400]  because the social media meme of 2022 up until October
[29:08.640 --> 29:11.480]  was that Instagram had sort of jumped the shark
[29:11.480 --> 29:12.980]  for lack of a better summary
[29:12.980 --> 29:16.360]  by cramming ever more stuff into
[29:16.360 --> 29:20.680]  what was once a very simple, very easy to understand app,
[29:20.680 --> 29:25.680]  and now it's an entire system of sub-networks
[29:26.160 --> 29:30.320]  and content types, and we could do a whole show
[29:30.320 --> 29:33.880]  just about the way that Instagram has ruined
[29:33.880 --> 29:37.160]  what it once was, which I'm not even passing judgment
[29:37.160 --> 29:39.240]  because maybe that's what they need to do to stay relevant.
[29:39.240 --> 29:40.080]  Who knows?
[29:40.080 --> 29:41.280]  Let's just give them the benefit of the doubt,
[29:41.280 --> 29:42.800]  but at least now nobody's talking about it.
[29:42.800 --> 29:44.920]  But one thing I do think is true
[29:44.920 --> 29:48.620]  is that Instagram has, throughout all of this,
[29:48.620 --> 29:52.060]  I can complain at length about their product decisions,
[29:52.060 --> 29:56.280]  but as a social destination,
[29:56.280 --> 29:59.640]  it seemingly never had the problems Twitter has had
[29:59.640 --> 30:01.640]  of being, oh, this is a place
[30:01.640 --> 30:05.240]  where you can get discriminated against,
[30:05.240 --> 30:07.280]  you can, you're gonna, I mean, it happens, right?
[30:07.280 --> 30:10.580]  But it seems like on Instagram that it's,
[30:10.580 --> 30:12.720]  there are mechanisms in place
[30:12.720 --> 30:15.440]  that keep it from turning into Twitter.
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.760]  For lack of a better term.
[30:16.760 --> 30:18.120]  At the risk of derailing a lot of this,
[30:18.120 --> 30:18.940]  and I don't wanna do that,
[30:18.940 --> 30:20.720]  but there's this interesting thing
[30:20.720 --> 30:23.160]  where somebody like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk,
[30:23.160 --> 30:24.600]  when they've removed all accountability,
[30:24.600 --> 30:25.960]  like they don't have a board of directors,
[30:25.960 --> 30:27.840]  well, Mark does, but he effectively owns
[30:27.840 --> 30:29.780]  all the voting chairs, so it doesn't really matter,
[30:29.780 --> 30:31.320]  and Elon owns the entire company.
[30:31.320 --> 30:32.840]  And it reminds me of sort of like,
[30:32.840 --> 30:34.560]  when people talked about the prequels with George Lucas,
[30:34.560 --> 30:36.080]  when you get to a certain stage,
[30:36.080 --> 30:37.440]  you start to think that you know better
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.640]  and you don't need accountability,
[30:38.640 --> 30:40.600]  you don't need people to push back on,
[30:40.600 --> 30:42.480]  you don't need boards, you don't need editors,
[30:42.480 --> 30:45.380]  and it's always to the detriment of the product in the end,
[30:45.380 --> 30:47.300]  because there's no one person who could ever
[30:47.300 --> 30:50.420]  really keep all of their own worst ideas in check.
[30:50.420 --> 30:52.080]  And it does remind me a little bit of those stories
[30:52.080 --> 30:54.640]  about Steve Jobs, like not wanting to make iTunes,
[30:54.640 --> 30:57.800]  but trusting Eddie and Phil enough to put it on Windows,
[30:57.800 --> 30:59.560]  or not wanting to make a small tablet,
[30:59.560 --> 31:01.080]  but like Eddie's saying, we've gotta do this,
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.500]  and Steve's like, fine, but if you screw it up,
[31:02.500 --> 31:04.280]  it's your ass, you know, but he'd at least
[31:04.280 --> 31:06.240]  like had people who would push back,
[31:06.240 --> 31:07.520]  or even like Sal, when he's like,
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.520]  you can't get rid of these accessibility features,
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.720]  like he's just yelling at them in front of a group of people
[31:11.720 --> 31:14.440]  and they didn't get rid of those accessibility features.
[31:14.440 --> 31:16.120]  That to me is the quality that I think
[31:16.120 --> 31:19.080]  so many of the latter day people who were equated to Jobs
[31:19.080 --> 31:21.600]  are just so fundamentally missing out on.
[31:21.600 --> 31:24.640]  Yeah, I do think so, because I do think that it's,
[31:24.640 --> 31:28.040]  I really do believe it, all of my years covering them,
[31:28.040 --> 31:31.520]  all of my years knowing people who work at Apple.
[31:31.520 --> 31:34.280]  I mean, obviously, there's a level of respect.
[31:34.280 --> 31:36.180]  I mean, you see, you need, as a personal skill,
[31:36.180 --> 31:40.800]  you need to be able to stand your ground respectfully.
[31:40.800 --> 31:41.920]  I mean, I don't think Apple
[31:41.920 --> 31:44.800]  has ever been a shouty place, right?
[31:44.800 --> 31:46.660]  People don't shout and have arguments,
[31:46.660 --> 31:48.860]  but it has always been a place,
[31:48.860 --> 31:52.220]  or at least post Steve Jobs next reunification,
[31:52.220 --> 31:55.280]  has been a place where you are definitely encouraged
[31:55.280 --> 31:57.960]  to disagree, even with the boss, right?
[31:57.960 --> 32:00.880]  Your boss, your boss's boss, you go right up to,
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.220]  I'm in a meeting, holy crap,
[32:02.220 --> 32:03.600]  I'm in a meeting with Steve Jobs,
[32:03.600 --> 32:06.240]  or in the modern days, I'm in a meeting
[32:06.240 --> 32:10.640]  with Craig Federighi or Tim or whoever else it might be,
[32:10.640 --> 32:13.280]  and you really disagree, you can tell them,
[32:13.280 --> 32:17.720]  I really disagree, but be ready to make your case.
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.440]  But they end that, they will listen,
[32:19.440 --> 32:22.960]  and you may not win, but you will be listened to,
[32:22.960 --> 32:26.280]  and you won't be fired just by disagreeing.
[32:26.280 --> 32:28.380]  In fact, it's much more likely
[32:28.380 --> 32:30.380]  that you're not going to succeed,
[32:30.380 --> 32:35.000]  and in a place like Twitter today,
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.020]  it's obviously very clear that disagreeing with the boss
[32:38.020 --> 32:40.560]  is a good way to get fired by the next day.
[32:40.560 --> 32:44.760]  And if the problem at Apple is that you never disagree
[32:44.760 --> 32:46.440]  because you're too timid to,
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.880]  or you're worried that that's not going to work,
[32:48.880 --> 32:50.800]  you're not going to get fired on a whim
[32:50.800 --> 32:52.260]  because you didn't speak up,
[32:52.260 --> 32:54.600]  but you may not last long because that's not the culture.
[32:54.600 --> 32:57.240]  You're expected to speak up.
[32:57.240 --> 32:58.940]  And I definitely think,
[33:01.880 --> 33:05.020]  I think that's part of the Steve Jobs legend
[33:05.020 --> 33:08.920]  that is truly just pure legend and isn't really true.
[33:08.920 --> 33:10.200]  Right, like there's story,
[33:10.200 --> 33:12.000]  I don't think it's ever happened, as far as I know.
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.880]  I don't think it's ever, there's always that one,
[33:13.880 --> 33:16.440]  the one story was that in the very early days of Jobs
[33:16.440 --> 33:18.960]  back at CEO that he was in an elevator
[33:18.960 --> 33:20.880]  with some random employee,
[33:20.880 --> 33:24.220]  and he asked them, what do you do?
[33:24.220 --> 33:25.880]  And they didn't really have a good answer,
[33:25.880 --> 33:28.040]  and then the elevator doors opened,
[33:28.040 --> 33:29.240]  and he's like, well, give me your name
[33:29.240 --> 33:30.400]  because you're fired.
[33:30.400 --> 33:31.240]  And I don't think that,
[33:31.240 --> 33:34.320]  I really don't think that that sort of thing ever happened.
[33:34.320 --> 33:35.880]  It just doesn't,
[33:35.880 --> 33:37.200]  because I don't think the people I know
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.160]  who stayed at Apple and worked under Steve Jobs,
[33:39.160 --> 33:41.880]  they never would, nobody would have put up with it.
[33:41.880 --> 33:43.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:43.480 --> 33:45.720]  Yeah, you can't keep the best people that way.
[33:45.720 --> 33:48.680]  So anyway, Twitter, I don't wanna say much more,
[33:48.680 --> 33:51.800]  but I guess I've got,
[33:51.800 --> 33:54.480]  I'm starting to crack the knuckles on Mastodon.
[33:54.480 --> 33:55.760]  I don't know.
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.680]  And again, I'm all in favor of it,
[33:57.680 --> 33:59.480]  and I think I have to say,
[33:59.480 --> 34:00.980]  I think it's holding up to the growth
[34:00.980 --> 34:02.480]  better than I thought it would.
[34:02.480 --> 34:05.200]  We'll see how it works long term.
[34:05.200 --> 34:09.320]  I do think the people who created it and cultivated,
[34:09.320 --> 34:16.320]  both created it technically and have been there, and I'm,
[34:16.320 --> 34:19.760]  I'm sensitive to the fact that there are people
[34:19.760 --> 34:21.880]  who've been all in on Mastodon
[34:21.880 --> 34:24.960]  as their Twitter-like social thing for years, right,
[34:24.960 --> 34:27.440]  at this point, for four years or more,
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.880]  and now all of a sudden there's all,
[34:30.880 --> 34:32.680]  at least from their perspective, right,
[34:32.680 --> 34:35.360]  not from the perspective of Twitter's overall user base
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.800]  or certainly not Instagram's or go even bigger,
[34:38.800 --> 34:42.840]  but from what Mastodon was three months ago
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.920]  to where it is today,
[34:44.920 --> 34:47.940]  overwhelming majority of the users are brand new,
[34:47.940 --> 34:50.400]  and that's always disruptive,
[34:50.400 --> 34:53.800]  and I'm sure that there are things that the longtime,
[34:53.800 --> 34:57.240]  years-long Mastodon users are already like,
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.520]  ah, man, we had a really nice thing going, you know?
[35:00.520 --> 35:02.000]  Who let the kids in here?
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.320]  Right, and it's, you know,
[35:03.320 --> 35:07.320]  it all goes back to the whatever they called it
[35:07.320 --> 35:10.880]  in September of every year in the 90, you know,
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.000]  pre-web 90s on the internet
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.200]  where the freshmen would come in
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.720]  and get their Telnet accounts at their university,
[35:18.720 --> 35:20.960]  and then all of a sudden Usenet,
[35:20.960 --> 35:23.360]  all of your favorite Usenet groups were full of people
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.800]  who didn't know what they were doing.
[35:25.800 --> 35:28.360]  Or when AOL opened up to Usenet, that was the day.
[35:28.360 --> 35:30.000]  Right, that was the big one.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.240]  That was, that was the end.
[35:31.240 --> 35:33.920]  That was the end of, I think that's when it became,
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.440]  I forget the lingo, but it doesn't,
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.640]  but it effectively became permanent September was the term,
[35:39.640 --> 35:41.840]  because it's never gonna stop at this point.
[35:43.440 --> 35:45.120]  But it is, you know, it is what it is.
[35:45.120 --> 35:48.200]  I guess the last thing I'll say before we wrap up the point
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.240]  is that the other point that's been percolating in my head
[35:52.180 --> 35:55.640]  is I think we all can see
[35:55.640 --> 35:58.240]  that there's never going to be another Twitter
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.760]  in terms of being the one global,
[36:02.760 --> 36:06.400]  unified, centralized, Twitter-like place
[36:06.400 --> 36:09.120]  where you just post, it's a brilliant idea.
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.960]  It is so simple that it's easy to overlook
[36:11.960 --> 36:14.580]  how brilliant the fundamental concept of Twitter is,
[36:14.580 --> 36:16.660]  because it's easy to understand.
[36:16.660 --> 36:20.480]  You get an account, there's one namespace for accounts,
[36:20.480 --> 36:22.100]  and what can you do?
[36:22.100 --> 36:25.820]  You can post a limited amount of text in a box,
[36:25.820 --> 36:29.440]  and it goes out to the people who choose to follow you,
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.240]  and you can choose the people whose tweets
[36:33.240 --> 36:35.960]  you yourself will see.
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.120]  That's a brilliant, it sounds obvious,
[36:38.120 --> 36:40.460]  it's hard to believe that somebody had to invent it,
[36:40.460 --> 36:43.580]  and it's like many of the very best inventions.
[36:43.580 --> 36:47.040]  It's really hard to see how it wasn't invented
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.040]  earlier than 2006, but it wasn't, and it is brilliant,
[36:52.760 --> 36:57.760]  but I ultimately think what Musk's stewardship of Twitter
[36:57.760 --> 37:00.900]  is accelerating is the conclusion
[37:00.900 --> 37:05.020]  that this is not a good idea for mankind, honestly,
[37:05.020 --> 37:08.300]  and I don't mean this in any hyper-herpabolic sense
[37:08.300 --> 37:13.300]  of drama, I just don't think humans are meant to,
[37:14.180 --> 37:15.860]  from all political spectrums,
[37:15.860 --> 37:18.620]  from all socioeconomic spectrums,
[37:18.620 --> 37:22.580]  from all geographic spectrums around the world,
[37:22.580 --> 37:26.900]  are all meant to be in one global namespace community.
[37:26.900 --> 37:30.600]  I don't think that's suited to human psychology,
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.700]  I really don't, and I think that where it sort of
[37:33.700 --> 37:38.460]  seems to have wound up, where Twitter's ultimate,
[37:38.460 --> 37:43.060]  the one thing that has been stable for, I would say,
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.960]  maybe the last seven years, I would peg it as around 2015,
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.140]  where Twitter's sustainable thing
[37:53.140 --> 37:56.220]  was becoming an outrage machine,
[37:56.220 --> 38:01.140]  and regardless of what you get outraged about,
[38:02.100 --> 38:03.840]  whether it's national politics,
[38:03.840 --> 38:07.820]  whether it's identity politics, whether it's economics,
[38:07.820 --> 38:09.900]  whether it's technical issues,
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.380]  it found equilibrium at a state where you keep getting,
[38:17.380 --> 38:21.220]  you keep encountering viewpoints that make you outraged,
[38:21.220 --> 38:26.140]  and it is taking advantage of a human instinct
[38:26.140 --> 38:31.140]  of, and you can see why we evolved this way,
[38:31.160 --> 38:33.700]  when you encounter something that makes you outraged,
[38:33.700 --> 38:36.960]  you react emotionally, and emotions are engaging,
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.380]  and it's just unpleasant emotions, unfortunately.
[38:41.380 --> 38:43.100]  There was this super weird thing that,
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.580]  back in the days of Mobile Nations,
[38:44.580 --> 38:47.060]  we had a website for every different platform,
[38:47.060 --> 38:49.700]  so the Google site, the Microsoft site, the Apple site,
[38:49.700 --> 38:51.340]  and one of the things that I found remarkable
[38:51.340 --> 38:53.180]  is that the people on the Apple site,
[38:53.180 --> 38:55.140]  they mostly just stuck on the Apple site,
[38:55.140 --> 38:57.580]  they were happy, they talked about the products they had,
[38:57.580 --> 39:00.980]  but in waves, you had people who preferred Nokia came in
[39:00.980 --> 39:03.740]  and just wanted to yell at them for using Apple products,
[39:03.740 --> 39:05.740]  and then when Nokia went away, it was like,
[39:05.740 --> 39:07.700]  got out of favor, it was Blackberry people,
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.800]  and I think it was the same people,
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.940]  just migrating to wherever there was the not Apple,
[39:10.940 --> 39:13.500]  and then they went to Windows Phone and Android,
[39:13.500 --> 39:15.100]  and they would always come and yell at it,
[39:15.100 --> 39:16.900]  and at times when,
[39:16.900 --> 39:18.460]  because there was a time when the accounts were unified,
[39:18.460 --> 39:20.660]  when they weren't, the people who just liked
[39:20.660 --> 39:22.420]  to talk about the Apple stuff were happy,
[39:22.420 --> 39:24.420]  but the people who only wanted to yell at other people
[39:24.420 --> 39:27.180]  were so upset, because they no longer had a place
[39:27.180 --> 39:28.540]  to go and yell at people,
[39:28.540 --> 39:31.620]  and I wonder if we lose this global system,
[39:31.620 --> 39:33.820]  the people who are just happy, like discussing,
[39:33.820 --> 39:36.040]  I don't know, Star Wars or Star Trek or whatever it is,
[39:36.040 --> 39:37.380]  will have their own little communities,
[39:37.380 --> 39:38.980]  and they'll just be happily discussing it,
[39:38.980 --> 39:41.400]  but the people who just wanted to go to war every day
[39:41.400 --> 39:42.560]  will have nowhere left to go,
[39:42.560 --> 39:43.620]  and ultimately they will have seen
[39:43.620 --> 39:46.920]  to their own dissatisfaction.
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.420]  Yeah, so, yeah, that's well said,
[39:50.420 --> 39:52.860]  and it's, we keep,
[39:52.860 --> 39:56.100]  we collectively, as people,
[39:56.100 --> 40:00.180]  are learning a lot about human psychology
[40:00.180 --> 40:01.500]  in very short order,
[40:01.500 --> 40:04.100]  because we've, in the internet era,
[40:04.100 --> 40:09.100]  we've built systems that simply have no possible analogy
[40:10.180 --> 40:12.820]  to the pre-internet, to pre-internet life.
[40:12.820 --> 40:16.680]  There's just, there's no comparison.
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.740]  There's no way that there's anything,
[40:18.740 --> 40:22.580]  anything like Twitter was possible in the analog world.
[40:22.580 --> 40:23.820]  It doesn't even make any sense.
[40:23.820 --> 40:25.860]  I can't even imagine some kind of
[40:25.860 --> 40:28.480]  steampunk sci-fi equivalent,
[40:29.480 --> 40:31.600]  and it turns out we're not hooked up.
[40:31.600 --> 40:32.960]  There's a good reason for that, right,
[40:32.960 --> 40:34.980]  and there's a good reason that humans
[40:34.980 --> 40:37.780]  segment themselves naturally into communities,
[40:37.780 --> 40:41.140]  and that you can be a member of multiple communities
[40:41.140 --> 40:43.260]  based on your work, based on your interests,
[40:43.260 --> 40:46.420]  based on your religion, your family.
[40:46.420 --> 40:47.260]  There's all sorts of ways.
[40:47.260 --> 40:48.100]  Your sports team, the kind of food you're into.
[40:48.100 --> 40:50.620]  Right, right, right, or,
[40:50.620 --> 40:54.380]  you know, just being by yourself,
[40:54.380 --> 40:56.500]  you know, a community of one,
[40:56.500 --> 40:59.380]  but a community of everyone doesn't work,
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.900]  and that's the ultimate lesson,
[41:00.900 --> 41:04.240]  and so I also feel that,
[41:04.240 --> 41:05.660]  so I think that's one reason Twitter's
[41:05.660 --> 41:06.860]  never gonna be replicated,
[41:06.860 --> 41:09.260]  and that Mastodon is never going to grow,
[41:09.260 --> 41:11.020]  and I think that the creators of Mastodon
[41:11.020 --> 41:12.880]  would be the first ones to say, yeah, that's good.
[41:12.880 --> 41:14.700]  We don't want to be as big as Twitter,
[41:14.700 --> 41:16.740]  you know, and we don't want that,
[41:16.740 --> 41:20.780]  so the naysayers on Mastodon, and you know,
[41:20.780 --> 41:23.460]  I have my doubts still about some aspects of it,
[41:23.460 --> 41:24.940]  and there's things I don't want to,
[41:24.940 --> 41:26.580]  I won't belabor, I, you know,
[41:26.580 --> 41:28.600]  but it might be, it's clearly right now
[41:28.600 --> 41:30.460]  the best we have as an alternative,
[41:30.460 --> 41:31.580]  but I definitely think, though,
[41:31.580 --> 41:34.580]  that going into it without any sort of thing
[41:34.580 --> 41:36.720]  where it's going to be a mega platform,
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.820]  and it doesn't, there's no VC,
[41:38.820 --> 41:39.820]  that it doesn't make sense,
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.700]  there is, because it isn't centralized, right,
[41:41.700 --> 41:43.460]  and so all of these problems are avoided,
[41:43.460 --> 41:44.900]  and a lot of the criticism is like,
[41:44.900 --> 41:45.900]  yeah, but they're never gonna get
[41:45.900 --> 41:47.180]  to a billion users, and it's like,
[41:47.180 --> 41:49.540]  yeah, that's the point, they shouldn't.
[41:49.540 --> 41:50.380]  Well, I don't know about you,
[41:50.380 --> 41:51.880]  but like, because I work remotely,
[41:51.880 --> 41:54.300]  I've worked remotely for the last, you know, 12 years,
[41:54.300 --> 41:56.100]  and in that time, I was always in,
[41:56.100 --> 41:57.500]  previously, the Mobile Nation Slack,
[41:57.500 --> 41:59.420]  and like, the Creator Slack that I'm in,
[41:59.420 --> 42:00.920]  I'm in Creator Discord groups,
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.420]  I have WorkGChat now, and those are all small communities,
[42:04.420 --> 42:07.580]  but like, those have become my water cooler now,
[42:07.580 --> 42:09.520]  just because I haven't been using Twitter as much,
[42:09.520 --> 42:11.220]  and it is a very different vibe,
[42:11.220 --> 42:13.600]  but it's one that's seized to a similar need
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.380]  of having a communal experience with people.
[42:16.380 --> 42:17.500]  Yeah.
[42:17.500 --> 42:18.620]  All right, let me take a break here,
[42:18.620 --> 42:19.660]  and thank our next sponsor,
[42:19.660 --> 42:23.420]  it is our good friends at Trade Coffee.
[42:23.420 --> 42:26.020]  Look, we are in the home stretch for the holidays,
[42:26.020 --> 42:27.020]  when you're listening to this,
[42:27.020 --> 42:29.360]  if you're listening to it while it's fresh,
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.340]  we got days to go before the holidays,
[42:31.340 --> 42:33.980]  but if you're looking for a last minute gift
[42:33.980 --> 42:36.680]  for some of the hardest to shop people to look for,
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.500]  look no further than a personalized coffee subscription
[42:40.500 --> 42:41.900]  from Trade Coffee.
[42:41.900 --> 42:44.380]  This is a fabulous last minute gift
[42:44.380 --> 42:45.620]  for somebody in your life,
[42:45.620 --> 42:48.100]  because you don't have to go get it,
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.300]  you don't have to wait for it to arrive,
[42:49.300 --> 42:50.940]  you can sign them up,
[42:50.940 --> 42:53.420]  and tell them they've got this subscription,
[42:53.420 --> 42:56.380]  and then they'll just start getting the coffee at home
[42:56.380 --> 42:58.660]  on their schedule, that's what Trade is,
[42:58.660 --> 43:00.780]  it's a coffee subscription service,
[43:00.780 --> 43:03.980]  and they make it so simple to discover new coffees,
[43:03.980 --> 43:06.420]  and make your best cup of coffee at home every day,
[43:06.420 --> 43:09.340]  they partner with the nation's top rated
[43:09.340 --> 43:10.460]  independent roasters.
[43:10.460 --> 43:13.100]  I mean, I'm about to say dozens,
[43:13.100 --> 43:14.460]  might be hundreds, I don't know,
[43:14.460 --> 43:16.220]  but I keep getting Trade Coffee,
[43:16.220 --> 43:17.580]  because I've been subscribed for months
[43:17.580 --> 43:19.460]  ever since they started sponsoring the show.
[43:19.460 --> 43:20.860]  I don't know that I've gotten coffee
[43:20.860 --> 43:23.780]  from the same roaster twice yet.
[43:23.780 --> 43:27.500]  It is a phenomenal array of small independent roasters
[43:27.500 --> 43:29.620]  around the country who they partner with
[43:29.620 --> 43:33.340]  to send you coffee that they know that you're going to love.
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.540]  You get the coffee, and then when you like it,
[43:35.540 --> 43:36.780]  you just go back on the website,
[43:36.780 --> 43:39.940]  or they'll send you an email if you want to remind you
[43:39.940 --> 43:41.740]  to give it a thumbs up, thumbs down,
[43:41.740 --> 43:43.900]  and you give more thumbs up,
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.660]  and then they start finding more coffee
[43:45.660 --> 43:47.740]  along the lines of what you've liked.
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.300]  It works great, because they've had nothing
[43:51.300 --> 43:53.100]  but great coffee ever since I started,
[43:53.100 --> 43:55.660]  but I'm digging the coffee I'm getting now
[43:55.660 --> 43:57.420]  more than I was when I first signed up.
[43:57.420 --> 44:00.420]  It really does work, and it is so convenient
[44:00.420 --> 44:02.440]  to never run out of coffee at home,
[44:02.440 --> 44:05.580]  and always have fresh beans arrive,
[44:05.580 --> 44:06.860]  and they really are fresh.
[44:06.860 --> 44:09.060]  You look at the dates, the roasting dates on these things,
[44:09.060 --> 44:12.900]  and they're often within three or four days of being roasted.
[44:12.900 --> 44:15.100]  There, the beans are in your hands.
[44:15.100 --> 44:16.780]  It is absolutely terrific.
[44:16.780 --> 44:20.520]  It is, again, a fantastic gift for loved ones,
[44:20.520 --> 44:22.460]  including a last-minute gift,
[44:22.460 --> 44:24.840]  or that week after Christmas,
[44:24.840 --> 44:25.920]  maybe that's when you're listening,
[44:25.920 --> 44:28.020]  but there's still people that you haven't seen
[44:28.020 --> 44:30.380]  since the holidays, and you're gonna see them at a party
[44:30.380 --> 44:33.080]  or something like that in between Christmas and New Year's.
[44:33.080 --> 44:35.380]  Trade coffee is a great idea,
[44:35.380 --> 44:37.980]  and right now, they're offering listeners of the talk show
[44:37.980 --> 44:40.380]  a total of $30 off a subscription
[44:40.380 --> 44:43.140]  and access to limited-time holiday specials.
[44:43.140 --> 44:48.140]  Just go to drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[44:48.140 --> 44:53.140]  That's drinktrade.com slash the talk show, all one word,
[44:55.860 --> 44:57.420]  and that's for 30 bucks off,
[44:57.420 --> 44:58.860]  just for listeners of the show.
[44:58.860 --> 45:02.260]  I'm literally drinking the last few sips
[45:02.260 --> 45:04.820]  of my pot of trade coffee today, right now,
[45:04.820 --> 45:05.820]  as I finish this read.
[45:05.820 --> 45:07.580]  It is great stuff, and it's a great gift.
[45:07.580 --> 45:08.420]  My thanks to them.
[45:08.420 --> 45:10.260]  All right, onward and upward.
[45:10.260 --> 45:13.180]  Quick, famous last words.
[45:13.180 --> 45:15.900]  I do think that the year in review is actually going to be,
[45:15.900 --> 45:19.200]  I think we can cover quickly,
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.040]  because I actually think, well, you know, spoilers,
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.680]  but I actually think that maybe Apple's 2022 year in review
[45:26.680 --> 45:29.620]  is that it's the year that the COVID and the lockdown
[45:29.620 --> 45:31.340]  finally caught up to them.
[45:31.340 --> 45:33.620]  I'm not saying it was a bad year or off year,
[45:33.620 --> 45:35.700]  but I was looking at it for the notes,
[45:35.700 --> 45:37.700]  and I'm like, this is, you know, and of course,
[45:37.700 --> 45:41.060]  I always come into these fabulously prepared, right, Renee?
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.440]  Same, yeah.
[45:42.440 --> 45:43.280]  Yeah.
[45:44.300 --> 45:46.240]  But I have to say, it's like, hey,
[45:46.240 --> 45:48.900]  there's actually not that much to talk about, so let's see.
[45:48.900 --> 45:51.780]  But one more bit of news before we keep going,
[45:51.780 --> 45:52.620]  or a couple bits of news.
[45:52.620 --> 45:55.340]  I want to talk a little bit about Freeform,
[45:55.340 --> 45:58.020]  which is a new app Apple has just launched
[45:58.020 --> 45:59.680]  with the latest updates to the Mac
[45:59.680 --> 46:01.860]  and iOS platforms last week.
[46:01.860 --> 46:06.860]  They did show it at WWDC when it shipped last week.
[46:06.900 --> 46:08.980]  I saw an awful lot of people saying the same thing,
[46:08.980 --> 46:10.980]  which was, hey, I sort of forgot about this,
[46:10.980 --> 46:13.780]  because I kind of feel that the demo,
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.600]  not that it was a bad demo at WWDC,
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.040]  but it was intermixed with, it was Craig Federighi
[46:22.040 --> 46:24.100]  and a bunch of people on his software team,
[46:24.100 --> 46:26.400]  including friend of the show, Lop.
[46:26.400 --> 46:27.240]  Yes.
[46:27.240 --> 46:28.780]  Michael Lop was there,
[46:28.780 --> 46:31.020]  referred to only by his last name, Lop.
[46:31.020 --> 46:33.980]  But it was a bunch of coworkers,
[46:33.980 --> 46:37.540]  the gimmick of the demo is a bunch of coworkers
[46:37.540 --> 46:40.460]  planning a team retreat, I believe,
[46:40.460 --> 46:44.000]  like go to some place where you can swing on ropes and-
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.300]  You can wear your tracksuits and just hang out.
[46:46.300 --> 46:48.700]  Right, wear your tracksuit and hang out.
[46:48.700 --> 46:51.560]  But it was all, the demo was sort of mixed together
[46:51.560 --> 46:56.060]  with FaceTime and iMessage
[46:56.060 --> 46:59.840]  and sort of Freeform in the middle.
[46:59.840 --> 47:02.540]  And even as somebody who's, obviously,
[47:02.540 --> 47:05.020]  watches these keynotes professionally
[47:05.020 --> 47:09.660]  and is to study the details as intricately as I can,
[47:09.660 --> 47:12.840]  I'm not sure if five minutes after the keynote,
[47:12.840 --> 47:15.420]  if I was sure that Freeform was going to be an app
[47:15.420 --> 47:17.340]  or if it was going to be a new feature
[47:17.340 --> 47:20.580]  built into iMessage and FaceTime.
[47:20.580 --> 47:22.460]  Yeah, I think they were trying to show that it was like,
[47:22.460 --> 47:23.580]  because they went to great pains
[47:23.580 --> 47:25.260]  to integrate iMessage and FaceTime
[47:25.260 --> 47:26.580]  so you could move seamlessly
[47:26.580 --> 47:28.540]  between group chats and group FaceTime.
[47:28.540 --> 47:29.980]  And this seemed like the note board
[47:29.980 --> 47:31.660]  that they were giving you to keep track of things
[47:31.660 --> 47:33.900]  while you were talking or texting,
[47:33.900 --> 47:36.980]  and it could either be integrated or its own thing.
[47:36.980 --> 47:38.480]  Right, but it's out now.
[47:38.480 --> 47:39.540]  I like it.
[47:39.540 --> 47:40.740]  It is interesting.
[47:40.740 --> 47:43.980]  I think there's, you know, the other hand,
[47:43.980 --> 47:47.460]  Apple doesn't come out with new apps very often, right?
[47:47.460 --> 47:50.020]  I would say the last time they came out with a new app
[47:50.020 --> 47:51.860]  along these lines was Clips,
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.180]  which still exists, it is still a thing.
[47:54.180 --> 47:57.420]  And Voice Memo, not Voice Memo, the songwriting version.
[47:57.420 --> 47:59.380]  I forget what it's called now,
[47:59.380 --> 48:01.780]  but it like disappeared rapidly.
[48:01.780 --> 48:03.580]  Yeah, well, Clips is still around
[48:03.580 --> 48:04.860]  and Clips, I still say,
[48:04.860 --> 48:07.060]  I know it doesn't seem to get a lot of use.
[48:07.060 --> 48:09.060]  It doesn't seem to have a lot of uptake,
[48:09.060 --> 48:11.260]  but I would still encourage everybody,
[48:11.260 --> 48:14.500]  anybody who's interested in user interface design
[48:14.500 --> 48:16.820]  to open it up every once in a while and look at it.
[48:16.820 --> 48:21.820]  Cause I do think it's a fascinating app design-wise.
[48:22.700 --> 48:23.540]  I kind of-
[48:23.540 --> 48:24.740]  It's terrific, they just shipped a square app
[48:24.740 --> 48:26.580]  in the age of vertical social.
[48:26.580 --> 48:29.020]  Yep, yep, that's part of it.
[48:29.020 --> 48:33.020]  And I think the other part of it is
[48:34.300 --> 48:39.300]  that the built-in tools for the networks
[48:39.660 --> 48:44.020]  where you share stuff, it's hard to beat them, right?
[48:44.020 --> 48:49.020]  So like creating your TikTok in TikTok at.app
[48:49.820 --> 48:53.140]  or creating whatever you're making for Instagram
[48:53.140 --> 48:57.420]  within instagram.app is,
[48:57.420 --> 48:59.300]  it's hard to get past that.
[48:59.300 --> 49:01.640]  And I know people use other third-party software
[49:01.640 --> 49:04.440]  to create content for those networks,
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.140]  but Clips is, it never, it hasn't,
[49:08.140 --> 49:10.100]  I don't want to spend too much time on Clips,
[49:10.100 --> 49:13.740]  but it's like a social network creation tool
[49:13.740 --> 49:16.500]  in need of its own social network.
[49:16.500 --> 49:19.900]  Enough more than what the camera tools provide.
[49:19.900 --> 49:21.220]  Cause otherwise you'd need Final Cut or Premiere
[49:21.220 --> 49:23.100]  or something, you're not going to use Clips.
[49:23.100 --> 49:26.460]  Right, but Freeform is, if you haven't checked it out,
[49:26.460 --> 49:30.300]  it is fundamentally, it's very interesting to me.
[49:30.300 --> 49:33.360]  Cause I've always been a fan of canvas-based apps.
[49:33.360 --> 49:36.540]  This goes back to my background in graphic design
[49:36.540 --> 49:39.260]  and really, really going deep and being,
[49:40.500 --> 49:43.140]  for a large number of years earlier in my life,
[49:43.140 --> 49:45.260]  QuarkXPress was my jam.
[49:45.260 --> 49:47.420]  Cause I just loved the metaphor.
[49:47.420 --> 49:51.420]  And back when QuarkXPress versus PageMaker
[49:51.420 --> 49:55.040]  was still a debate, I was firmly in the QuarkXPress camp
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.060]  because it stuck more to the basic canvas model
[49:59.060 --> 50:01.780]  where, okay, you create a page size
[50:01.780 --> 50:04.540]  and this is where Freeform breaks apart.
[50:04.540 --> 50:07.900]  Whereas in the desktop era, page size mattered.
[50:07.900 --> 50:10.240]  There had, you know, eight and a half by 11
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.040]  or 11 by 17, but there had to be some sort of,
[50:14.040 --> 50:16.960]  well, this is how big it would be when you print it.
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.700]  And you'd make this and then you would drop boxes
[50:20.700 --> 50:24.660]  onto the canvas and the boxes could contain different types.
[50:24.660 --> 50:27.640]  You could create a box that would create an image
[50:27.640 --> 50:29.180]  and then you would fill the image
[50:29.180 --> 50:31.660]  with an image somewhere in your file system.
[50:31.660 --> 50:33.800]  Or the box could be text, of course,
[50:33.800 --> 50:35.300]  and you would fill the image.
[50:35.300 --> 50:36.720]  You could either type the text
[50:36.720 --> 50:39.140]  or you could import from a document.
[50:39.140 --> 50:42.440]  For some number of years, there was, you know,
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.880]  while we chased the dream,
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.840]  there was the publish and subscribe stuff
[50:45.840 --> 50:49.400]  where you could connect the text box to a document.
[50:49.400 --> 50:52.280]  And if the document changed after you had first imported,
[50:52.280 --> 50:56.080]  the changes would reflow live into the thing
[50:56.080 --> 50:58.160]  that it felt very futuristic at the time.
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.360]  Never really worked well enough to get.
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.400]  Most people I knew who were in even a professional setting
[51:06.400 --> 51:11.400]  to go away from the numbered revisions to the file.
[51:11.500 --> 51:14.920]  Final, you know, Renee's column, final,
[51:14.920 --> 51:16.760]  Renee's column, final, final.
[51:16.760 --> 51:19.760]  Renee's column, final, final, final.
[51:19.760 --> 51:22.660]  Which one do you, which one do you have?
[51:22.660 --> 51:24.540]  Do you have final or final, final?
[51:24.540 --> 51:26.480]  I've got, I've just got final.
[51:26.480 --> 51:27.320]  Oh no, you need final.
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.920]  I have final JG edits.
[51:28.920 --> 51:32.800]  Yeah, I need final JG edits final.
[51:32.800 --> 51:35.120]  But it's a great metaphor for design.
[51:35.120 --> 51:36.920]  And then you can move the boxes around
[51:36.920 --> 51:39.340]  and you can connect them and you can drag other things out
[51:39.340 --> 51:40.540]  and create lines and rules.
[51:40.540 --> 51:42.600]  And that's, you know, basically free form,
[51:42.600 --> 51:47.600]  except they've, there's, the canvas is unlimited
[51:47.600 --> 51:49.040]  so there's no page size.
[51:49.040 --> 51:51.520]  And the other big metaphor change
[51:51.520 --> 51:53.520]  is it's not document-based.
[51:53.520 --> 51:55.560]  You don't create a new document
[51:55.560 --> 51:58.800]  and then have a document somewhere where you need to save it
[51:58.800 --> 52:01.000]  whether it's local on your machine
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.260]  or in your iCloud or on your Dropbox.
[52:03.260 --> 52:06.720]  It's more of a library app where, you know,
[52:06.720 --> 52:10.920]  same way like Apple Notes, I guess is probably the app
[52:10.920 --> 52:13.720]  that is the most familiar to the most people
[52:13.720 --> 52:18.720]  where your notes aren't corresponding to individual files
[52:19.400 --> 52:21.040]  anywhere in the file system.
[52:21.040 --> 52:25.400]  They're just in a library that is managed by the software
[52:25.400 --> 52:30.400]  and the connection between what's yours and what's shared
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.340]  is part of the design of the system.
[52:34.340 --> 52:36.800]  Which is to say it is built for the modern era, right?
[52:36.800 --> 52:40.740]  Documents as objects in the file system are,
[52:40.740 --> 52:42.200]  they're never gonna go away.
[52:42.200 --> 52:44.320]  You know, I still use them, I'm sure you use them,
[52:44.320 --> 52:46.320]  I'm sure just about everybody who listens to this show
[52:46.320 --> 52:49.580]  still uses them and depends on them for some things.
[52:49.580 --> 52:52.320]  But going forward, it's a much more modern,
[52:52.320 --> 52:56.040]  forward-thinking way to not worry about that.
[52:56.040 --> 52:57.960]  That's just an implementation detail
[52:57.960 --> 53:00.900]  and they're just, it's just a board
[53:00.900 --> 53:03.620]  or I don't know what we call the ones in free form.
[53:03.620 --> 53:06.080]  I don't know what they're called, but it works.
[53:06.080 --> 53:07.740]  You can share and right out of the gate,
[53:07.740 --> 53:11.400]  it lets you share a space with other people
[53:11.400 --> 53:14.880]  using just their iCloud ID, very much the way
[53:14.880 --> 53:17.720]  that you can collaboratively edit Apple Notes
[53:17.720 --> 53:21.060]  with somebody else and it's very, you know,
[53:21.060 --> 53:24.640]  the more of those features something like this debuts with,
[53:24.640 --> 53:27.120]  the better they are in my opinion
[53:27.120 --> 53:30.040]  because when you take an old thing
[53:30.040 --> 53:33.700]  and then try to add new systems like collaborative editing,
[53:33.700 --> 53:35.120]  which is complicated, right?
[53:35.120 --> 53:36.520]  I mean, you don't even have to be a programmer
[53:36.520 --> 53:39.480]  to think about the ways that letting two people
[53:39.480 --> 53:43.680]  edit the same document of any type at the same time
[53:43.680 --> 53:46.480]  is, huh, you could see how that would get tricky
[53:46.480 --> 53:49.000]  pretty quick as a programming task.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.900]  I think it's pretty neat and I can't think
[53:50.900 --> 53:52.480]  of anything else quite like it
[53:52.480 --> 53:55.240]  and I'm really, I'm glad to see Apple
[53:55.240 --> 53:57.760]  still coming up with ideas like that.
[53:57.760 --> 54:00.320]  Do I wanna bet on whether it's going to become a hit
[54:00.320 --> 54:05.040]  or is it really gonna languish a bit like clips?
[54:05.040 --> 54:06.200]  It's hard to say, right?
[54:06.200 --> 54:08.100]  I don't know, what do you think?
[54:08.100 --> 54:11.640]  I think it's like often the strengths are the weaknesses
[54:11.640 --> 54:12.880]  or the blessings are the curses
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.220]  and I think one of these examples
[54:14.220 --> 54:16.080]  is that it is so tightly integrated
[54:16.080 --> 54:17.800]  into messages and FaceTime
[54:17.800 --> 54:19.640]  that it makes it almost a no-brainer
[54:19.640 --> 54:21.800]  for people who are incredibly immersed in the ecosystem
[54:21.800 --> 54:23.860]  to just use it, like it's similar to Apple Notes.
[54:23.860 --> 54:25.760]  We're doing the show notes in free form today
[54:25.760 --> 54:28.060]  but we've done them in Apple Notes previously
[54:28.060 --> 54:30.320]  and it's incredibly easy to share them and use them
[54:30.320 --> 54:31.960]  but because it's bound,
[54:31.960 --> 54:34.120]  because it is so deeply meshed in the ecosystem,
[54:34.120 --> 54:36.080]  it means there's no real use beyond this.
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.200]  Like there's no green bubble of friends for your free forms
[54:40.200 --> 54:41.760]  and that's gonna mean that in some capacity,
[54:41.760 --> 54:44.360]  professionally or personally, you're gonna run into a wall
[54:44.360 --> 54:46.620]  where it's gonna make sense to share something
[54:46.620 --> 54:49.440]  that is maybe web-based instead
[54:49.440 --> 54:52.280]  or maybe open source or multi-platform instead
[54:52.280 --> 54:56.160]  and it's always a question of iMessage is so good
[54:56.160 --> 54:58.580]  for people who, for families or friend groups
[54:58.580 --> 55:00.900]  that have messaging that everyone just uses it
[55:00.900 --> 55:02.640]  to the extent that it's one of the most popular
[55:02.640 --> 55:04.480]  messaging solutions in North America.
[55:04.480 --> 55:06.720]  FaceTime, it's almost like the default
[55:06.720 --> 55:08.560]  when people talk about it on TV, FaceTime.
[55:08.560 --> 55:10.220]  This could end up being that
[55:10.220 --> 55:11.720]  but I think when it comes down to documents
[55:11.720 --> 55:13.000]  and being able to share them,
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.720]  a lot of people are deeply invested
[55:14.720 --> 55:17.260]  in stuff that's web-based at this point.
[55:18.760 --> 55:21.640]  Yeah, and there is a webby type feel to free form.
[55:21.640 --> 55:23.680]  Did you, by the way, did you add anything
[55:23.680 --> 55:26.040]  to our shared free form board for this?
[55:26.040 --> 55:28.600]  No, I was terrified because you had several links in there
[55:28.600 --> 55:29.720]  before the year in review
[55:29.720 --> 55:31.080]  and I figured if I put anything more in there,
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.280]  we would just never get to year in review.
[55:33.280 --> 55:35.560]  Add, do me a favor and just add something
[55:35.560 --> 55:38.100]  because I did, it occurred to me as I fired it up
[55:38.100 --> 55:41.080]  and I'm looking at it for the show, I'm like,
[55:41.080 --> 55:43.520]  because if Renee has been adding to this,
[55:44.800 --> 55:47.060]  I'm not getting them and I guess we should talk
[55:47.060 --> 55:49.160]  about the fact that this isn't working.
[55:49.160 --> 55:51.740]  No, it's 100% working, it's here.
[55:51.740 --> 55:52.580]  It's,
[55:55.600 --> 55:56.600]  why did they make it?
[55:56.600 --> 55:58.480]  I think that the only reason they made it
[55:58.480 --> 56:00.520]  is that they've, somebody within Apple
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.220]  sort of had the idea for this
[56:02.220 --> 56:04.040]  and the more they talked about it
[56:04.040 --> 56:05.600]  with other people at Apple,
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.280]  the people are like, yeah, this is a good idea,
[56:07.280 --> 56:08.340]  we could do this.
[56:08.340 --> 56:10.140]  I believe, I don't know and of course,
[56:10.140 --> 56:12.440]  Apple famously doesn't really give a lot
[56:12.440 --> 56:14.120]  of individual credit to the people
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.600]  who conceive of and engineer ideas
[56:16.600 --> 56:19.860]  but my understanding is that it's people,
[56:19.860 --> 56:22.380]  I don't know if they're formerly of the iWork team
[56:22.380 --> 56:24.660]  or they're still on the iWork team
[56:24.660 --> 56:27.700]  but it's people who nearing and design wise
[56:27.700 --> 56:30.900]  have worked on pages and numbers and keynote
[56:30.900 --> 56:33.220]  and their collaborative features
[56:33.220 --> 56:35.840]  and building this from scratch
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.120]  and it must, I think it works better conceptually
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.980]  because again, pages, numbers and keynote
[56:42.980 --> 56:45.840]  are fundamentally anchored in the old metaphor
[56:45.840 --> 56:50.840]  of the truth is a document that you save
[56:51.020 --> 56:53.440]  somewhere in a file system somewhere
[56:53.440 --> 56:55.540]  and yes, you can add people to it
[56:55.540 --> 57:00.540]  but trying to make an online live collaboration thing
[57:00.540 --> 57:02.800]  that is fundamentally rooted in a file
[57:02.800 --> 57:07.000]  that is somewhere on a system is, it's a mismatch
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.520]  and I think that's why Google Docs
[57:09.520 --> 57:13.000]  have always worked better for collaborative editing
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.200]  than things that are more rooted in the file system
[57:17.200 --> 57:22.200]  because the Google Docs natural isn't really a file,
[57:23.180 --> 57:27.240]  it's a URL that creates the illusion of being a file
[57:27.240 --> 57:28.960]  but if you really want it to be a file,
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.200]  you've got to take a snapshot and export.
[57:31.200 --> 57:32.240]  Yep, 100%.
[57:32.240 --> 57:34.400]  And that's why I think that famous graph
[57:34.400 --> 57:36.760]  that Steve Jobs stood in front of when he was announcing
[57:36.760 --> 57:39.120]  iCloud showed the devices and something going up
[57:39.120 --> 57:41.200]  and then copies of them coming back down
[57:41.200 --> 57:44.200]  rather than something being propagated from the cloud.
[57:44.200 --> 57:49.200]  Yeah, let's see where Freeform goes
[57:49.560 --> 57:50.880]  but I kind of have a feeling
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.200]  that Apple is committed to this.
[57:52.200 --> 57:53.740]  I think they think it's a good idea.
[57:53.740 --> 57:56.240]  I think they're going to keep iterating on it
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.720]  and it's going to be there
[57:57.720 --> 58:00.280]  and it's also like many, many, many things
[58:00.280 --> 58:02.040]  in the world of software,
[58:02.040 --> 58:05.160]  it's hard to figure out the true appeal of it
[58:05.160 --> 58:07.040]  until you need it and then all of a sudden
[58:07.040 --> 58:08.680]  when you do need, it's like something
[58:08.680 --> 58:10.320]  for everybody out there, it's like yeah,
[58:10.320 --> 58:11.840]  I'll bet a lot of people have done what I did
[58:11.840 --> 58:15.560]  which is sort of fire it up and kick the tires a little
[58:15.560 --> 58:17.200]  and import this and import that
[58:17.200 --> 58:18.420]  but you don't really have a thing
[58:18.420 --> 58:21.080]  you really want to do with it yet
[58:21.080 --> 58:23.840]  and it's like when you actually do have that thing
[58:23.840 --> 58:26.480]  you really want to do, then all of a sudden
[58:26.480 --> 58:28.640]  you'll be like hey, this is actually awesome.
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.560]  My wife and I were redecorating our living room
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.520]  and put a bunch of pictures of sort of thing
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.600]  that maybe people have done on Pinterest
[58:38.600 --> 58:39.840]  or something like that but like hey,
[58:39.840 --> 58:43.260]  let's just share a bunch of photos of other rooms we like
[58:43.260 --> 58:45.760]  and we could doodle on them with an Apple pencil
[58:45.760 --> 58:48.720]  on an iPad and say ignore this,
[58:48.720 --> 58:51.120]  I'm not talking about art on the walls like this,
[58:51.120 --> 58:53.800]  I'm just talking about the color of the paint.
[58:53.800 --> 58:56.240]  So I do have a conspiracy theory though along those lines
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.400]  and that is like I think a lot of the stuff Apple's done
[58:58.400 --> 59:01.720]  over the last seven plus years has been prep work
[59:01.720 --> 59:04.720]  for when they get into VR and AR more seriously
[59:04.720 --> 59:06.520]  especially all the sharing emoji
[59:06.520 --> 59:09.340]  and FaceTime and iMessage groups
[59:09.340 --> 59:11.840]  and this to me makes sense when you're starting
[59:11.840 --> 59:13.960]  to talk about that world in the future
[59:13.960 --> 59:17.280]  where you might just be walking like you and Amy
[59:17.280 --> 59:18.600]  walking through a room saying what do you want to do
[59:18.600 --> 59:20.480]  with this and you both put on your glasses
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.780]  and you start moving things around
[59:21.780 --> 59:25.240]  and freeform is an actual 3D environment that you share.
[59:25.240 --> 59:30.240]  Like the counter antidote for Facebook horizons
[59:30.240 --> 59:33.280]  where it's something personal and malleable?
[59:33.280 --> 59:34.620]  Maybe, who knows?
[59:34.620 --> 59:37.520]  I'm not quite sure how this would look in VR
[59:37.520 --> 59:41.160]  but I don't know how anything's gonna look in VR.
[59:41.160 --> 59:42.400]  Yeah, same.
[59:42.400 --> 59:44.040]  I don't have too much more to say about it
[59:44.040 --> 59:45.960]  but I'm glad that it's there
[59:45.960 --> 59:48.820]  and I guess if I had to bet,
[59:48.820 --> 59:51.640]  I'm gonna bet that it'll be to some degree,
[59:51.640 --> 59:52.720]  I think it's gonna stick.
[59:52.720 --> 59:54.960]  I think people when they encounter something
[59:54.960 --> 59:56.440]  where they need something like this
[59:56.440 --> 59:58.240]  or could use something like this
[59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.280]  are going to, it'll be a continual source of discovery
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.760]  where months from now or a year from now
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.560]  somebody's gonna be like yeah, I never used it
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.400]  but then I tried freeform and it was perfect
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.880]  for planning a vacation or something like that.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.960]  Longer than a head of lettuce,
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.880]  probably longer than music memos,
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.280]  hopefully as long as clips.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.000]  There is something where,
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.440]  this is John Siracusa's gripe on ATP
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.320]  was the fact that if you really just wanna scribble
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.200]  on the board, you'd need an Apple Pencil
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.080]  and there's no way to just scribble on the Mac
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.080]  with your mouse which does seem like a strange omission
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:37.740]  and it's kind of hard not to see how,
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.360]  I don't know, not to suspect that somewhere
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.960]  they're like the only good way to scribble
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.960]  is with a pencil and therefore you need an iPad to do it.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.060]  Yeah.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.880]  I don't know.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.720]  It's sort of an Apple Pencil.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.760]  Did they just get around to it yet?
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.680]  Yeah, or maybe they just never underestimate
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.120]  what simply is we did not get around to it yet
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.720]  and Apple Pencil support on iPad
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.260]  was like a must be in 1.0 feature
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.480]  and scribbling from the iPhone without a pencil
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.680]  or from the Mac without even a touch screen
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.760]  are coming later and of course.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.880]  Cut and paste third year problems.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.260]  Right and it is of course Apple
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.240]  so we don't have any kind of roadmap public
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.640]  of oh don't forget we're gonna add this, that
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.480]  and the other thing.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.200]  I guess the other weird thing that strikes me
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.480]  about it is the fact that the sticky notes
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.480]  have to be square which I guess relates
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.460]  to what people think of as sticky notes
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.000]  in the real world which are square
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.440]  but you can grow them as big or as small as you want
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.460]  and so by being able to grow them
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.000]  they're already not skeuomorphic.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.360]  You can't go and buy paper sticky notes
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.820]  and stretch them to make them bigger
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.400]  so once you can stretch them
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.000]  why not let me stretch them to make it longer
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.360]  or wider if that's what suits the content.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.000]  It seems slightly limiting that they have to be square
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.080]  but that's a minor detail.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.160]  Yeah minimal shippable product.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.880]  Yeah well let's just jump right in
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.740]  without a break to the last thing on my news to cover
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.000]  and this is serendipity that you're on the show
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.200]  because I know you've had a keen interest in this.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.060]  You and I have talked about this on the show.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.200]  As many times as I've talked about the same thing
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.460]  over and over again you and I have talked about Apple
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.000]  and backups and security and end-to-end encryption
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.880]  and Apple this here we are it's December
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.040]  usually the slow month but Apple actually
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.560]  has had some news right in addition to freeform
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.680]  the bigger news in my opinion is what Apple
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.280]  is calling iCloud advanced data security
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.100]  and in my show notes I only have one word
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.400]  and it is finally.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.640]  Yeah it deserves one.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.440]  But it is an ironic finally where I'm not complaining
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.680]  that it has taken them as long as they have.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.400]  Do I wish they had gotten to this point sooner?
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.960]  I do of course because I think it is important
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.600]  that it matters but I totally understand
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.120]  why they haven't and I could see how if they opened
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.000]  if they invited you backstage metaphorically
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  and showed you every step of the way of the last 10
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.920]  maybe even more years of where they've moved
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.920]  iCloud security that in some sense it might be
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.720]  hard to imagine how they could have moved faster.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.280]  Yeah it's also it's one of those things
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.600]  where I think everyone on Twitter tends to be a nerd
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.400]  and because we're all on Twitter together
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.520]  we think everybody thinks the way that nerds think
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.280]  and like we think there's just a majority opinion
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.840]  when really it's like a very small minority opinion
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.500]  and we don't often think or empathize
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.320]  with the larger community we think about
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.160]  oh like everything has to be encrypted
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.600]  because somebody might steal my XYZ
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.160]  where for the vast majority of people
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.400]  it's like oh my god I forgot my password
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.240]  I'm never gonna get my baby pictures back
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.840]  and like that is the biggest harm or damage
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.360]  that they could ever experience
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.200]  and that's what used to have with the original version
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.420]  of iCloud you had to print out those recovery keys
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.760]  and people lost them all the time and went to Apple
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.460]  and Apple had to say sorry like all that stuff is lost.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.680]  So the new version was more fail safe than fail secure
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.800]  so that Apple could go in and recover those things
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.200]  and yeah it sucked for people
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.400]  who really did want to use it as a secure store
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.680]  for things that they would rather lose the ability
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.500]  to access than ever have stolen
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.780]  but that again is not a mainstream concern.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.560]  Mainstream people don't want to lose things.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.980]  There's very few people who are targeted
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.040]  for that kind of stuff.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.040]  So building that out is non-trivial
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.560]  like I think we saw that with recovery contacts coming out
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.520]  I think that was a big step towards this
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.340]  and just Apple finally figuring out a way
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:47.280]  to make it optional because there's so many services
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.840]  like this Apple gets all the attention
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.840]  but if you're accessing files on the web
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.000]  that's really complicated with full encryption.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.320]  Doing some of the things Dropbox
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.200]  or other storage providers do really really complicated
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.120]  if you're fully encrypted
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.680]  and sometimes you've got to make your own binary blob
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.920]  on your computer and upload it
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.640]  and then you can't retrieve files if you're like remote
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.760]  and you want to go back and just pull out a single file
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.600]  from Ren's computer.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.360]  So big topic really complicated
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.720]  but I'm really really glad that we have the option
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.600]  and I'm glad that the option is not enabled by default
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.480]  because you have to go in there and say
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.760]  I am going to accept responsibility for my own data loss.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.520]  Give me this, give me the recovery stuff,
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.840]  I will manage this and then hopefully that's like
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.440]  signifying that you're capable of doing
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.960]  all that kind of stuff.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.840]  Yeah I guess I should have recap that the,
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.000]  to me the centerpiece of Apple's new advanced
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.360]  iCloud data security system is that backups
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.640]  and your iCloud photo library
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.240]  are now can be if you opt in end to end encrypted
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.840]  which is and again Apple has been,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.500]  without them ever saying we are building towards
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.760]  enabling end to end backup encryption
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.020]  and iCloud photo library it,
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.380]  the clues have been there
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.020]  that they've been working towards this
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.280]  and of course they you know famously
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.860]  they make such a big deal out of privacy and security
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.560]  and they've you know to their credit.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.980]  Like when the there was that shooting
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.580]  in San Bernardino California a couple years ago
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:23.080]  and the FBI had a phone from one of the suspects
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.160]  and couldn't access the contents of it
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.000]  and wanted Apple to, again I followed it closely.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.680]  I believe that the long story short of that
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.200]  was what they wanted Apple to do
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.040]  was to create a one-off version of iOS
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.400]  that they could, that could,
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.680]  I don't even know if it's possible to flash it
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.560]  onto the phone but to somehow get it onto the phone
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.520]  without destroying the contents of the phone
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.640]  but then once this new version of iOS had been installed
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.400]  it would allow them to circumvent the,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.140]  enter the device passcode to unlock the encrypted contents
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.720]  that are stored on the phone
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.140]  and they stood their ground and made the argument
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.880]  in as plain a language as they could
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.600]  without you know that they certainly
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.120]  weren't seeking confrontation
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.200]  with the United States Department of Justice
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.360]  but they also weren't going to compromise
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.040]  on doing what they believe was right
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.480]  and doing what they believe is right
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.840]  is not deliberately creating a back door
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.100]  and just in a little way like the fact
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.320]  that the contents of our phones are encrypted on device
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.320]  and you know they, it just it is an enormous subdivision
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.000]  of Apple's software engineering division
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.160]  that is devoted to these features
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.040]  and it is, it encapsulates in so many ways
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.920]  the Apple is at its best at the intersection
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.160]  of hardware and software
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.900]  and that only Apple can do this right
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.700]  because then you get into the areas
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.960]  where like the entire concept
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.360]  of a hardware secure enclave on device
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.440]  is truly essential.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.720]  There's no, the way that they do the encryption
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.280]  of your data on the device is all based on that
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.240]  and it's hand in hand.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.440]  And I know some people are gonna quibble
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.240]  because like end to end encryption,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.960]  so all the stuff that goes off the iPhone
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.260]  between us and Apple is end to end encrypted in transit.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.040]  At rest, it's also end to end encrypted.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.200]  The only difference was for iCloud backup
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.800]  for things that, there's two sort of clients.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.320]  There was regular iCloud backup
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.780]  and there was secure iCloud backup
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.640]  for like health data and things like that.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.740]  That was always separate
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.820]  but the general iCloud data, it was encrypted end to end.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.000]  It's just that Apple had a copy of the key.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.880]  So we had a copy of the key on our device.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.260]  Apple had a copy of the key.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.160]  That way, if we lost our key,
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.120]  if we lost our phone,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.140]  we forgot like when we originally printed out those things,
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.600]  whatever, we lost our password, forgot it.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.600]  They, you could go through this elaborate,
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.680]  exhausting recovery process,
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.500]  prove ownership and reclaim a copy of your data
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.820]  and that was only possible.
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.420]  And the side effect of that
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.920]  was that then it was subject to subpoena
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.760]  because it existed and Apple could gain access to it.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.000]  And I think that it was never,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:08:59.840]  like I know some people were like,
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.920]  oh, the FBI told Apple to do this.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.880]  I think Craig said that on Joanna's video too.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.400]  Like we were never asked to do this.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.920]  Like this was a customer service issue, first and foremost,
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.900]  and now they can have both,
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.780]  which I think is better for everybody.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.280]  Right, and that's what you and I have speculated for years.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.760]  You and I have been in complete agreement
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.600]  that the biggest holdup to enabling end to end,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.080]  true end to end, what I would say,
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.640]  I would quibble with what I think you slightly misspoke,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.480]  where I think to qualify as end to end,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.280]  there can't be a key held in the middle.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.580]  Yeah, that's fair.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.240]  Right, so it is your stuff,
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.640]  and people who don't follow this closely have been like,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.960]  wait, my backups weren't encrypted before?
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.520]  No, well, they were encrypted.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.360]  They weren't on a drive
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.800]  where anybody could just walk in and take them.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.280]  Like if somebody walked and took it off the drive,
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.760]  they were still encrypted.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.120]  Right, they're encrypted.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.280]  Your device encrypts them as the backup is going to iCloud.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.560]  So over the wire or through the air,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.640]  let's face it, is more common, especially for an iPhone.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.040]  Over the internet, it's encrypted,
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.720]  and it goes to Apple, and it gets stored on Apple.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.760]  Ultimately, a cloud server is just a box
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.080]  somewhere in a data center.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.800]  It's a computer in a data center
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.160]  with drives connected to it.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.000]  On those drives, the data is encrypted,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.500]  and then when it comes back to you,
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.800]  because let's say you're restoring from a backup,
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.280]  it is sent back over the drive, over the air,
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.160]  over the internet, encrypted,
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.640]  till your device receives it and decrypts it
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.360]  so that it can restore the backup.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.040]  Yeah, it's encrypted, and I misspoke about that part.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.280]  But the difference is that Apple held keys,
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.280]  and then therefore, if they were given a proper subpoena,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.200]  then they could be forced to hand over the keys and the data,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.680]  whereas now, if you enable advanced data,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.760]  I'm gonna get this right.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.600]  What's it called?
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.280]  Advanced data security.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.540]  Advanced data protection.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.520]  Well, whatever it's called.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.360]  You enable it.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.180]  You opt in.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.160]  What Apple does is they throw away their key.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.500]  So one of the things,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.640]  because they've been building towards this for years,
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.760]  is you don't have to, if you decide to opt in,
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.380]  it's not like, oh, but now your entire iCloud photo library
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.080]  is invalidated because you hadn't been using it
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.400]  because advanced data security didn't exist before.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.000]  Now it does.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.240]  Now you've got to re-upload your entire photo library.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.640]  No, you don't, because all they do is when you're like,
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.480]  are you sure?
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.320]  Are you really sure?
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.820]  Okay, here you go.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.820]  They just throw away their key.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.320]  And I believe you have to set up a recovery contact
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.840]  or print out a recovery code
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.880]  and put it in a safe deposit box
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.480]  for them before you can enable it.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.960]  Right, you have to have some sort.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.440]  You have to tell them,
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.080]  but they can't verify that the person,
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.920]  if you've said, yes, I've printed this thing out.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.960]  You told me to print it and put it in my safe
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.120]  or a safe deposit box
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.680]  or wherever you keep your secure documents,
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.320]  but you have to have one of those things set up.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.920]  I believe you can have both.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.320]  You can both set up a,
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.040]  and I think that having that emergency contact,
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.240]  a spouse, a sibling, a trusted friend, a parent,
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.440]  whoever it is who you trust,
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.680]  and you're saying, if anything ever happens
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.800]  and I get locked out of my iCloud,
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.420]  I would let Renee be a person who could vouch for me
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:29.360]  and would let me, could let me back into my account
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.200]  just by you maintaining control.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.660]  And I wouldn't get any information.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.760]  I would just be able to let you back in.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.040]  Right, you wouldn't be,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.080]  yes, you wouldn't have access to my iCloud photo library.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.020]  You would just be able to,
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.380]  it turns you into a person who can do
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.000]  what my other devices do,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.240]  which is say, yes, this is me.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.520]  I know this code.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.600]  It's the numbers 123007.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.040]  Type it in and you're good to go.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.080]  Or you can have one of these,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.400]  I think they're like 28 characters, something like that,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.840]  just long enough to certainly be safe
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.700]  from any kind of brute force attack
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:07.680]  that you can print out and put somewhere.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.780]  Counterintuitively, I know Bruce Schneier
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.780]  has made this argument more eloquently
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.220]  than anybody probably ever could,
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.660]  that people intuitively think printing out
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.720]  something very important like that is terrible security.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.280]  Oh my God, the worst thing you could ever do
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.120]  is write your passwords down in a book
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.080]  or print out this thing that is the key
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.360]  to the kingdom of your entire iCloud account.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.720]  But it turns out human beings are really good
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.520]  at keeping physical objects secret, right?
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.560]  Because we evolved in the physical world
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.680]  over millions of years.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.440]  And we're good at imagining things like that
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.280]  and good at understanding what's a safe place to put this
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.960]  and what's not.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:52.800]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.480]  Marriage licenses, birth certificates,
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.920]  all sorts of documents, we're very good at keeping those.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.920]  Right, and if you just keep it in a drawer in your bedroom,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.160]  and that's as safe as it is, that's probably pretty safe.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.160]  And if you have an adversary who's in your bedroom
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.400]  going through your drawers,
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.160]  you've got a lot of problems, right?
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.000]  I mean, perfect is the enemy of good enough sometimes.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.040]  It reminds me of Dave Nainian
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.320]  when I was asking him about encrypting backups
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.440]  for like a super duper.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.520]  He's just like, do you know how many valuable things
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.840]  you have in your house that somebody might wanna steal?
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.800]  Your wedding photos and your kids' photos
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.000]  are probably low on that list.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.600]  Just back them up normally, put them someplace safe.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.860]  But back in the early days of going online
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.760]  and having an online life and having multiple accounts,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.000]  I know, I certainly succumb to this personally.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.120]  At some degree, your human intuition
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.640]  is that the safest place to keep a password is in your brain.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.000]  Yeah. Right?
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.640]  I've got it, I've got it up here.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.400]  And here I am, imagine me, if this was a YouTube show
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.440]  instead of an audio podcast, I'm doing that thing
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.820]  where I'm tapping my forehead, right?
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:03.220]  Ah, it's up here, it's all up here.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.680]  And that's exactly though the mentality
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.040]  that the next step after that is,
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.780]  well, I can't memorize 40 different passwords,
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.960]  and I certainly wouldn't remember which one goes to which,
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.200]  so why don't I think of one really clever password,
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.960]  and I'll use that really clever password everywhere.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.800]  Yeah, yes.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.640]  And it made sense, I did it.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.680]  Or that plus the name of the site,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.100]  nobody'll ever guess that.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.480]  Oh, right, right, I did that.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.840]  I definitely did, and every once in a while,
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.680]  I still run into some old thing
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.120]  that I haven't logged into in a while,
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.440]  and I'm like, oh, yep, I gotta change that password.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.560]  That's, you know, haven't logged in here
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.360]  in a couple of years, but here, let me do this.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.880]  Let me make a new one-time password, there it is.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.960]  It's saved in my iCloud keychain or wherever else.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.840]  But you know, it wasn't, it was misguided,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.160]  but I don't think it was stupid.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.680]  And I think, you know, if we re-rolled the universe
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.520]  a thousand times, everybody would do it a thousand times.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.560]  We'd go through an era when everybody had
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.860]  like their favorite password and we'd reuse it,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.620]  and it's, it's like I said with Freeform,
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.960]  not having to evolve out of a document-based
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  legacy concept and can start with a cloud-based,
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.320]  no documents, it's all in the library idea from the start.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.320]  iCloud has had to move live with now billions of users,
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.560]  but you know, for a very long time,
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.140]  hundreds of millions of users from a system
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:38.140]  that wasn't created with true end-to-end encryption in mind
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.380]  to get to a place where it is.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:47.380]  But, and again, everybody seems happy that,
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.140]  with Apple's announcement about advanced data protection.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.340]  Well, I mean, everybody outside of law enforcement
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.040]  and probably some nation states.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.280]  Right, and it's also easy to,
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.900]  the other thing that was, I think I wrote about it.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:07.820]  It was so clear a year ago that Apple's now abandoned,
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.580]  because that was the other bit of news
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.580]  that Craig Federighi told Joanna Stern
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:14.020]  in her interview with him about this stuff
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.180]  for the Wall Street Journal,
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.860]  that Apple has decided to not go forward
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.900]  with all the CSAM scanning stuff
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.340]  that they had announced last year,
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.500]  that they've taken the criticism to heart
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.240]  and that they're going to focus their efforts
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.240]  on insofar as CSAM material of putting their efforts
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.000]  towards nipping it in the bud before it's even created.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.840]  Yeah.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.940]  You know, and there's things they can do
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.700]  to help in that regard.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.620]  But the idea was, if they're going to move,
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.580]  the thinking I had last year was,
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.100]  if they're going to move iCloud Photo Library
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.220]  to be end-to-end encrypted, at least optionally,
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.620]  they're trying to say here, but we're still,
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.740]  even with end-to-end encryption,
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.020]  without us holding the keys,
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.920]  we're still taking this, that, and the other step
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.920]  to keep CSAM material from being part of somebody's library.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.500]  Whether they were right to a,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.020]  I actually still think that it was not,
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.620]  I don't think that what they were proposing was a bad idea.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.340]  I wasn't, I was not opposed to it.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:16.540]  I see, I see the arguments against it,
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.260]  but I'm in the middle where I actually think
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:23.640]  the system that they were proposing was not going to,
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.700]  if they had instituted it,
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.820]  I don't think it would have led to the problems
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.860]  that people were thinking that there would be.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.620]  I don't think, I don't think that they were going
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.260]  to be weak to potential attacks where somebody
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:42.260]  could create a false image that isn't actually
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.980]  CSAM child pornographic content,
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.620]  but it would match the fingerprint of one that is,
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.940]  and then they would somehow maliciously insert it
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.940]  into your iCloud Photo Library and do that 20 times
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.380]  or 30 times or whatever the threshold was,
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:01.380]  and then boom, your account is flagged.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.580]  Because even if they did that,
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.760]  I thought that that human review step
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.820]  where they would look at the image,
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:09.500]  and if somebody can just insert,
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.420]  if somebody wants to attack you in this way
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.620]  and they have access and somehow can insert images
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.580]  into your iCloud Photo Library,
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.180]  why wouldn't they just put the actual
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.220]  child pornographic material in your library
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.060]  and let it be triggered?
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.900]  I think a lot of that was like,
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.860]  there's like one of the other side effects of social media
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.140]  is that you have a lot of performative desperation theater
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.280]  where people want to get attention
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.020]  by making a lot of slippery slope arguments,
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.420]  and I think some of them,
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.740]  you know, whether other countries
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.660]  would try to impose their own databases.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.500]  There were concerns.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.020]  I think the biggest one for most people
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.580]  was just the emotional concern,
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.980]  the idea that some part of your phone
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.180]  was no longer yours, was under control,
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.180]  and whether that's always been true
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.060]  with system update processes or not,
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.540]  it just felt like photos are mine,
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.560]  they're deeply personal,
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.520]  and I don't like the idea of something being done
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.440]  on my phone.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.540]  I always hoped it'd be a compromise solution
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.860]  where either Apple would leverage the trusted intermediary
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.980]  technology that they were doing
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.300]  with like their VPN-like solution
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.340]  where it would be done on a server in between you and Apple
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.800]  so that Apple would have zero knowledge
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.860]  but the bits wouldn't live on your phone
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.620]  the same way they do now with the internet,
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.500]  or that they would make a separate photos app
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.060]  and say like, if you want your photos on your phone,
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.500]  here's like the white icon version
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.780]  and those phones are never going online,
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.760]  but if you do want to make use of iCloud storage,
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.500]  then you download the online yellow version or whatever,
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.740]  and that one, you know that they're gonna go online
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.460]  but they're gonna be scanned as they're going online,
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.780]  and that way you can opt in or out,
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.260]  like visibly opt in or out.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.500]  Realizing that was the word I was looking for.
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.060]  Yeah, that was sort of what I thought they were,
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.940]  and I'll bet that when they said,
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.060]  okay, we've taken your criticism to heart,
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.020]  I get it that it was sort of a philosophical,
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.220]  not technical argument that people were offended
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.180]  that it would be happening on their own devices,
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.580]  even if it's just fingerprinting.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.100]  Right, I also, though, believe that there was no way
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.960]  to get past people's fundamental misunderstanding
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.460]  that they were not going to put a library of CSAM material
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.460]  on everybody's phone for the checking,
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:08.780]  just the fingerprints,
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.420]  but I get it that people didn't even want the fingerprints.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.900]  Again, I'm not quite sure why that would bother me.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:14.960]  It's like having a metal detector
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.780]  on the door of your house instead of at the stadium
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.220]  that you're gonna go watch the game at.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.620]  I guess, I don't know, or like, I don't know,
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.580]  but I get it, I think Apple listened.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.700]  I do think that, I'll bet that when,
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.420]  typical Apple, they took their time,
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.420]  they said, okay, we're gonna listen,
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.300]  we're gonna put this on pause, we'll get back to you.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.040]  I'll bet that that is one of the things
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.460]  they very strongly considered,
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.540]  was having these intermediary servers
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:44.960]  and a two-step process where you connect to one,
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.240]  this one connects to another,
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.860]  but the one that does the processing
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.940]  doesn't even know where it came from
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.580]  and does the fingerprint checking
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.580]  and then says, this fingerprint is A-okay,
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.300]  go ahead and upload it to iCloud Photo.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.620]  And I think that they ultimately said,
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.900]  you know what, why build all this stuff,
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.680]  why don't we just skip it?
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.340]  And then anybody who was gonna complain
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.020]  and say, hey, you can't just let people
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.580]  end-to-end encrypt their photo library,
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.700]  what about, what if they're stashing
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:14.180]  horrible, horrible CSAM material in their library?
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.820]  You know, they could say, we tried.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:19.820]  We had a proposal to look into this.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.300]  We do care deeply about it,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.140]  but your privacy is your privacy.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.060]  And this is one of those ways where they do,
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.260]  speaking to people at Apple and getting briefed
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.980]  about it off the record, that they do still look at it
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:36.080]  in the way that, back in the day, pre-Cloud,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.180]  everything that you did on your computer
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.480]  was on a disk and the disk was in front of you somewhere,
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.220]  whether it's a floppy disk or a hard disk or something.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:46.540]  And those disks were yours and it was up to you
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:50.260]  how secure they were and how secure the room they were in
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:55.140]  was and how, you know, and that all they're trying to do
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:00.140]  in the modern digital age is put that level of user control
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.560]  over the data back into their hands if they want it.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.340]  The other complaint that I've seen people have,
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:10.840]  I think the EFF, who I believe is almost entirely
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.400]  on the right on this, but I don't think I'm putting words
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.500]  in the EFF's mouth that they were like,
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.660]  this is all great, except it shouldn't be opt-in.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.220]  It should be the default for everybody.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.920]  I think that I disagree with that.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.980]  And I'm not quite sure, maybe someday it will be.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:33.740]  Maybe they'll get to the point and maybe with 10 years
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.740]  of trusted use of using other people you know
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.860]  in your family as your trusted backup contact
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.020]  to get back into your account.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:49.140]  But the customer service angle of this where clearly
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:54.140]  there are way more Apple customers who come into the store
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.900]  and say, you know, I left my phone in a cab
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:02.900]  and I don't know my iCloud password.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.800]  I've forgotten it.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.180]  I've tried to get in on the web 10 times
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.580]  and it's locked me out.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:09.660]  I don't know what to do.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.960]  I have an iCloud backup and I want to replace the phone
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:16.260]  that I just lost, but I don't know how to get my backup.
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.260]  There is a process you can go through and it's obvious.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.340]  It seems anecdotally, in terms of when's the last time
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.740]  you heard of anybody getting ripped off this way.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.840]  In other words, if somebody comes into an Apple store
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.900]  and they're not me and they're somehow saying,
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.740]  I'm John Gruber and I, you know.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.360]  It's an arduous process though.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.940]  They're very stringent about you proving
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.020]  that you own the device and stuff, yeah.
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:43.420]  Right, it's not like, oh, I have a 215 Genius Bar appointment
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.900]  and after three minutes of explaining my problem,
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:50.020]  boom, the Genius behind at the Apple store
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.580]  has my full decrypted app.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.860]  Right, but it is possible and my understanding
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.780]  is that all of our speculation that it's more common
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.460]  than you might think has all been true, you know,
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.980]  including just, you know, people who listen to the show
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.580]  who work at Apple retail stores and they're like,
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.760]  yeah, it happens every, you know.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.060]  So at least once every day,
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.980]  somebody comes in with this problem.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.980]  Whereas the problem of some foreign state
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:24.660]  with an apparatus has hacked into Apple's cloud servers
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.340]  and taken the key to your backup
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.680]  and stolen your data that way, you know.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:34.940]  It's, yeah, it's very small.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:38.580]  Very small, there are fewer people who need this
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.180]  than there are people, typical consumers
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.700]  who probably shouldn't turn it on.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.100]  So I kind of feel, wouldn't be surprised
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.380]  if this is the natural end state.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.980]  The only way I could see it becoming a little bit more
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.740]  likely to be turned on by typical people
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.340]  would be if like next year or the year after
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.040]  or at some point in the next handful of years,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.720]  it becomes part of the onboarding process
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.860]  for a new device or a new software update,
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:10.060]  you know, that you install iOS 18 two years from now.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:13.300]  And after the installation's complete
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.740]  and you go through those first run screens,
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:19.640]  you know, like where you set up face ID or touch ID
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.940]  and you opt into sharing your analytics
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:25.820]  with Apple and third-party and developers
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.140]  and this, whatever other, you know,
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.800]  there might be a time where they put there,
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.780]  do you want to turn on advanced data security?
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.560]  Here's what it means.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.220]  It means you're on your own and Apple will never,
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.580]  literally mathematically, cryptographically
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.960]  cannot help you restore your data.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.760]  You know, do you want to do this and make the button,
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:49.400]  the big blue default button be not to use it?
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400]  You know, use standard security.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.640]  If there was a radical Supreme Court decision
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.140]  or like mega Patriot Act sort of bill passing
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.100]  where people's, we're at large scale people's data
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.900]  was a jeopardy, but otherwise, like you said,
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.140]  it's like let people have the option
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.300]  and it's hard to make informed decisions about this.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:06.380]  Reminds me of that scene in West Wing
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.980]  where they're like nuclear deterrence
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.180]  is like a conversation that you can't just have casually.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.660]  It involves incredibly deep understanding
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.540]  and not people aren't just equipped to have it.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.660]  You know, it's like one of those things,
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.780]  like it's, I did a whole 15 minute video
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.860]  on like the pros and cons of encryption
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.500]  versus non-encryption and what kind of data
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.580]  you should use for each.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.700]  And it really does vary based on your threat level,
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.900]  your model, what kind of data we're talking about.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.620]  It is not like just like, it made to sound
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.260]  like just everybody should do it all the time
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.900]  because that's what InfoSec nerds tell you.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.840]  But people who live in backup and recovery worlds
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.300]  who deal with customers all the time
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.840]  will give you a very, very different story.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.500]  So I would just urge people to really assess
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.400]  what kind of dangers they face and whether,
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.820]  if you would be more upset if you lost access yourself
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.340]  than have it stolen, don't use the encryption.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.300]  If it'd be more damaging to you if things got stolen
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.820]  than if you lost them yourself,
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.000]  then turn on the encryption.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.140]  And my favorite thing though, John,
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.340]  is that none of this was live tweeted over a 24 hour period
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:04.820]  by Craig Federighi during a major sports championship.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:07.040]  This whole decision process was years in the making.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.060]  Have you turned it on?
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.160]  I have not because I literally can't
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.880]  because I still have too many devices
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.460]  that aren't running the latest OS.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.400]  It's not in Canada yet.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.060]  Oh, that's right, yeah.
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.260]  Yeah, but I probably won't turn it on
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.020]  because again, like most of my stuff is like family memories
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.740]  that I don't want to lose access to.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.900]  And I could set up the stuff, but saying that now,
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.260]  I just painted a huge target on me.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.360]  So maybe I'll have to turn it on now,
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.920]  but normally I wouldn't.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.440]  I've been comfortable with the state
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.980]  of my iCloud security for years,
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:35.180]  so I'm comfortable keeping it.
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.300]  But it would be more arduous for me to get rid
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.980]  of all the devices that are still connected
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.940]  to my iCloud account that, I mean, I guess what I should do
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.980]  is just go into iCloud and kick a bunch of,
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.180]  through the web interface, kick a bunch of old devices out.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.260]  And if I ever do want to go back to using my iPhone 5S,
[01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.100]  just sign back into iCloud.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.440]  But for the time being, I'm happy not doing it,
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.100]  but I'm very glad that it exists.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.900]  It is, you know, and I'm happy to see
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.100]  that Apple has been working on it.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:04.940]  All right, let me take-
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:05.980]  And if I was like a college kid who was intent
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.100]  on running for president one day,
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.380]  I'd turn it on in a heartbeat.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.620]  Let me take a break here.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:15.420]  Our next sponsors are good friends at KOLIDE, K-O-L-I-D-E.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.700]  If you are listening to this podcast,
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.380]  the odds are good that at some point,
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.720]  you or your company are gonna go through an audit,
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.720]  like SOC2 or ISO 270127001.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.620]  I don't know what those numbers are.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.900]  They don't sound pleasant to me.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.580]  But when you do go through these audits,
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.840]  you have to answer some tough questions
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.380]  about endpoint security.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:39.460]  Questions like, do all of your company laptops
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.900]  have their disks encrypted?
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.740]  Speaking of security, does everyone have
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.000]  the company's password manager installed?
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.920]  Do you have a system in place to monitor
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.760]  and maintain compliance throughout your cross-platform
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.140]  defeat of computers?
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.520]  If you're confident, even if you are confident,
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.220]  that the answer to all of those questions is yes,
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:02.340]  the bigger question is, can you prove it to an auditor?
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.100]  If you're not quite sure how you'd go about
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.580]  proving compliance across your fleet of devices,
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:08.260]  then you need KOLIDE.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.060]  KOLIDE is an endpoint security tool for the Mac, Windows,
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.060]  and now even Linux devices that does things
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:16.380]  that MDMs cannot do.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.700]  And it gives you the visibility you need
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.820]  to achieve and maintain compliance.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.460]  And best of all, KOLIDE does not resort
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:27.300]  to surveilling your employees or locking down their devices.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.020]  It instead works with end users rather than fighting them
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.920]  to resolve issues, and it relies on their cooperation
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.260]  and their informed consent.
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:39.500]  You can meet your security goals and pass, improve,
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.380]  and audit without compromising on privacy.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:47.380]  Visit kolide.com slash the talk show to find out how.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.100]  If you follow that link, KOLIDE's gonna hook you up
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.100]  with a goodie bag, including a t-shirt,
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.480]  just for activating a free trial.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.480]  That's k-o-l-i-d-e dot com slash the talk show.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.120]  KOLIDE dot com slash the talk show.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.900]  Still not up to the year in review,
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:09.220]  I just realized we didn't talk about Germin's whole thing
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.340]  with the DMA, this is why me thinking,
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.580]  hey, I don't need to do a lot of episodes in December.
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:16.780]  Well, guess what, there's a lot of stuff in December.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:21.260]  But Mark Germin had a spectacular report
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.900]  about Apple's internal efforts to comply
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.580]  with the EU's new Digital Markets Act,
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:32.060]  which I guess is signed, I guess it's finalized,
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.480]  it's going to be the law of the land,
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.180]  they need to be in compliance by March of 2024.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.980]  And basically, they're working on how they're going
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:43.820]  to allow sideloading and allow third-party app stores
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.540]  within the letter of the law, this DMA in the EU.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.700]  They are unsure, or at least Germin sources are unsure,
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:56.440]  whether such features, whichever ones come to pass
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:00.540]  and come to be in iOS, are going to apply only
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.380]  to customers in the EU, where it's the law of the land
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:06.260]  and what would be worldwide.
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:08.020]  I wrote about this, Jason Snell
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.060]  had a fantastic piece about it.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:14.540]  And ultimately, and again, it's Germin at his best.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.340]  I don't know who else would have gotten this story,
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:18.780]  but he's got some details about who's leading up
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:22.060]  the engineering inside the software division at Apple
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.000]  and has some of the, just some of the questions,
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.340]  even inside Apple.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.080]  I thought the other thing that was really interesting
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.800]  about his report is that, almost just offhandedly,
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.300]  but part of it was that the people working on it
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.220]  in Apple aren't really happy to be working on it,
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.500]  because it doesn't really seem to them like,
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.340]  you know, the sort of thing that they signed up
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.580]  to work at Apple to do.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.140]  I guess that, you know, I wrote about it,
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.420]  I've talked about it on Dithering,
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.800]  I don't want to spend tons of time here,
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.420]  but having wasted a day, not wasted,
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.140]  I keep complaining about it, I'm glad I spent the time
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.540]  to read as much of the DMA as I could.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.840]  Yeah, I complain because I don't like it,
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.340]  and the more I think I understand it,
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.980]  and understand at least the words that they've written,
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.380]  the worse I think it is as a law.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:14.220]  I think, fundamentally, it is a law written by regulators
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.040]  who do not understand what it is they're trying to regulate.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.060]  The EU has a history of good intentions
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.180]  with very bad implementations.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.380]  Yeah, their intentions, I think, are fine, of course.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.860]  Well, I say of course, but you know,
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:28.160]  you can imagine a government that has bad intentions.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.220]  I do think their intentions are good.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.540]  I don't think that what they've written is good.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.500]  And I'll just reiterate the thing I mentioned,
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:40.180]  you know, in my article, that compare and contrast this,
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.500]  which is broad and ill-defined,
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.900]  like what exactly does it mean to have a third party
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:49.180]  app store, what does it mean to have side loading?
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.860]  And there's all sorts of ways it can be interpreted.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:55.060]  Compare and contrast with the law that they've passed
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.380]  saying that if you make any of these type of devices,
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.500]  cell phones and tablets and headphones,
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.040]  and they charge via a port,
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.700]  that port needs to be a USB-C type port
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:10.380]  as of, I don't know, sometime in 2024.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.700]  I disagree with that regulation as law.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.020]  I don't think it's necessary,
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.220]  and I think that the market was actually working.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.540]  I think that the era of having dozens
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:22.080]  of different phone chargers and device chargers
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.220]  for different devices is long past,
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.220]  and that some of Apple's devices have stuck with Lightning
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:34.180]  for over 10 years, as opposed to Apple having already
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.060]  moved them to USB-C on their own,
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.420]  I don't really think is problematic.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:40.540]  I think that's the way the market works.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.000]  But at the very least, the law is clear,
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.820]  and it's easy to understand, right?
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.120]  If you make one of these type of devices,
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.960]  and the device list is pretty clear,
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.820]  and it charges via a port,
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.020]  so that something that doesn't have a port,
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.540]  like Apple Watch, that only charges inductively,
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:59.100]  doesn't need to add a USB-C port.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.260]  If it does have a port, though,
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.140]  that port needs to be USB-C.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:02.980]  All right.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.980]  One of the ports has to be USB-C.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.540]  They could have both, famously.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:08.520]  Right, you could have a proprietary port
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.860]  that also charges, again.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:11.860]  So MagSafe is not illegal, right?
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:13.260]  I mean, you know, we laugh,
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:16.820]  but Apple's laptops, which already do have USB-C,
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.860]  don't have to get rid of MagSafe,
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.100]  because it's not saying you only have to do it.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.400]  But it's easy to understand,
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.400]  and you can understand what would be compliant
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.420]  and what's not.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:30.420]  Whereas with this DMA, it is incredibly difficult,
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.660]  in my opinion, I would say impossible,
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.540]  just going from the letter of the law
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.860]  to determine what would be in compliance
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:39.160]  and what would not.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.100]  So here's one question.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.080]  Here's a simple question.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:47.080]  Apple, last year, implemented app tracking transparency,
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.120]  and everybody's familiar with it now,
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.500]  because everybody uses apps,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.040]  and you've been asked, you know,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.180]  this app would like to track you across other apps.
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.060]  Would you like to ask, would you like to allow that,
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:01.120]  or would you like to ask the app not to track?
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.740]  Everybody's familiar with this dialogue.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.140]  Everybody is, almost everybody is surely familiar
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.020]  with the fact that it has seemingly led
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.940]  to a significant revenue decline for Facebook,
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:14.500]  most famously, but lots of other apps and companies,
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.100]  you know, that are in the advertising market.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.220]  Google, perhaps, to some degree,
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.760]  but not as much as Facebook.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.980]  You know, that it's, that as a direct result of this policy
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:27.140]  and the number of people who choose ask not to track,
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:30.260]  that revenue has declined, people get this.
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.980]  What happens in the world of sideloading
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.380]  if an app just says, screw it, you know,
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.900]  if you use, or third-party app stores, right?
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.680]  So let's just throw Facebook under the boat.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.000]  If Facebook comes out with a third-party Facebook app store
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.100]  for iOS, and you can get Facebook and Instagram
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:52.200]  and Messenger and whatever other apps they might have
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.520]  or come out with, you can get them
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.060]  from Facebook's app store, too,
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:59.380]  and maybe their apps in Apple's app store
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.980]  will start telling you, you know,
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.580]  pushing you to switch to the Facebook app store,
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.840]  and maybe they'll throw in some kind of reward
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.660]  for doing so, right, might literally bribe people.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.420]  I don't know, you know, offer them money.
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:12.500]  They offer teenagers.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.800]  System scanning, right, exactly.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.140]  They offered teenagers, like, 20 bucks to install a VPN
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.540]  so that they could track what teenagers were doing
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:22.380]  on their phones.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.420]  That's literally what they did.
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.140]  I mean, they didn't even really hide it.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.980]  It wasn't like, oh, they got caught.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.720]  It was like, no, that was clear, you know.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.100]  No, that's what it said on the tin.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.860]  Well, what happens if they do that,
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:36.780]  and their apps, you know, go back to tracking willy-nilly
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.240]  and ignoring this?
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.740]  Does Apple have the right to pull their developer key
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.280]  and keep those apps from working,
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.860]  because they're not in compliance
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.620]  with app tracking transparency?
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:51.820]  I mean, the App Store is not just a store.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:56.020]  The App Store is the point of enforced compliance
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:01.020]  with platform policies, not just store policies, right.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.020]  So the store policy that everybody's obsessed with,
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.420]  and rightly so, I mean, because money is important,
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.840]  but the thing that everybody thinks about first and foremost
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:11.640]  but you're missing the larger picture
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.260]  if it's all you think about is the 70-30 commission split,
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.860]  85-15, you know, after a year,
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:20.380]  or for small companies up to a million dollars.
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:23.540]  That part of App Store compliance is clear,
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.240]  that's the definition of a store, is making money.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.780]  And so the commission on sales,
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:30.740]  either sales of the app and game,
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:34.460]  or sales in-app purchase or in-app subscriptions
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:39.180]  in the app or game, is the store enforcing store policies.
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.740]  But there's all sorts of other stuff in the App Store,
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.620]  and the App Store review process
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:48.620]  that are enforcing platform policies for iOS system-wide,
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.900]  like the fact that you can't use private APIs,
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.440]  and they have automated tools that detect
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.100]  if an app submitted is using private APIs.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.100]  And before a human being even sees it,
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.020]  if you just use a private API in your app
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:06.740]  and you submit it for inspection by the App Store,
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.620]  it'll just bounce right back to you and say,
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.820]  you know, you're using this private API
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.660]  to see what's on the desktop behind your window,
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.380]  that's not allowed, please fix this
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:17.000]  before you resubmit another bill.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.460]  What happens within the world of,
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:22.180]  if this world is coming of side-loaded
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.420]  and third-party App Stores,
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.060]  does Apple still get to enforce that somehow?
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:28.780]  Yeah, it's that interesting question
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:31.920]  where a lot of people, like, we've talked about this,
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.780]  but there are console models,
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.600]  which Steve Jobs and Apple clearly wanted the iPhone to be,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.160]  where it's like a Nintendo or it's like a PlayStation,
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.780]  and it just has the things that are supposed to run on it
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:44.300]  and it's not meant to be an open computing platform.
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.920]  Although people argue now it is so popular and so powerful
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.420]  that there's almost a moral imperative
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.500]  for it to become an open compute platform.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.660]  And then you have the alternative,
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.020]  which is Android, or previously there were others,
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.980]  like Android, which is much more like an open compute system
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.300]  and that the argument essentially is whether
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:03.140]  each platform into itself has to be both things.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.700]  Like, on Android, you can choose
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.480]  to just use a Google Play Store,
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.300]  or you can choose to sideload apps,
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.300]  and Epic will tell you that,
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.780]  they still don't work really well with sideloaded apps,
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.380]  but whatever, you have those options.
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:16.600]  Where with Apple, it's like you have the App Store
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.060]  or you have the web, and for some people,
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.820]  that's not a bug, that's a feature,
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.860]  and people will say, well, you still have the choice,
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:24.620]  the same way you have it on Android,
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.020]  but to your previous point,
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:28.500]  if enough powerful people have enough powerful incentives,
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.620]  there could be apps that people just believe
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:33.140]  are fundamental to their use models,
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.060]  and whether it's Facebook or a game,
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.260]  or it's a school saying you have to download our thing
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.220]  to run your tests, or whatever it is,
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.900]  they could compel people to have to do this.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:46.220]  So I'm hoping whatever it is,
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.820]  it's one of those things where you have
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.820]  to literally reboot the device to get it into a state
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:52.780]  where you can start sideloading apps,
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.960]  because otherwise, people are gonna just find ways
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.880]  to trick you into sideloading stuff all the time,
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.780]  and it's gonna be the security nightmare
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.180]  that Apple has often painted it to be.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.620]  If we put aside the money, and again,
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.600]  putting aside the money, we should come back to it.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.740]  I'm not saying everybody should forget about them,
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.180]  but if you put aside the money,
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:12.780]  and if they passed a law that just said
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.440]  that a gatekeeper company,
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.460]  by their definition of gatekeepers,
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:22.460]  if they sort of put into law the Phil Schiller memo idea
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.700]  from 10 years ago or more,
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:28.960]  which was entered as evidence in the Epic case,
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.220]  where when the app stores started growing revenue-wise,
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:36.640]  beyond what even Apple executives themselves
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.460]  might have ever foreseen as possible,
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:43.080]  Schiller floated the idea in a memo to the other executives
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.860]  of what if we just said we'll cap our revenue
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:49.620]  from the app store at let's just say a billion dollars
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:52.860]  a year, and once we go past that,
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:55.300]  then we'll just start lowering the commission rate
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.820]  to keep it at a billion dollars.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.940]  So instead of 70-30, go to 25.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:03.460]  Keep it at breakeven, or just above breakeven.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.260]  And just, yeah, or keep it at a billion dollars, right?
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:09.940]  A billion dollars isn't breakeven, it's nice money,
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:13.400]  but then it won't just keep growing and grow to a level
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.620]  where it could pervert the company's motivations,
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.340]  or corrupt the company's motivations.
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:22.480]  And they could put something in law that says
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.140]  that if you run an app store,
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:26.120]  your revenue is capped at a certain level,
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.260]  or they could put into law that says
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.780]  if you charge a commission, that commission,
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:32.900]  and you qualify as a gatekeeper company,
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.900]  so like Panic wouldn't run into this with the play date,
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.420]  because they're so small, but that they could say
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.340]  that it's capped at 15%, or it's capped at 20%,
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:45.920]  or whatever, they could do something like that.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.600]  But put aside the money, Apple, this is what so many people
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.960]  who are hyper-focused on the money don't see,
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.440]  is that Apple, across the company,
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.940]  has reasons to want this control over the platform
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.780]  in the name of customer experience.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.140]  And I bring this up, and there's some number of people,
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:08.980]  again, Twitter being Twitter, it often happens there,
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.020]  and I try to argue in good faith.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.820]  I don't own Apple stock for professional reasons,
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:17.860]  just so that I never have to worry,
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:21.720]  am I hurting my own future retirement
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.240]  by what I report on the company?
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.300]  So I'm not doing this because I, in some way,
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.700]  I don't make money when Apple makes more money
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:31.500]  through the App Store, but I totally,
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.180]  what I see that other people don't see
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.580]  is that the reason people thrive on this platform,
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.980]  so many people thrive on this platform,
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.260]  is because of these constrictions,
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:43.780]  these restrictions that are so different
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.260]  than the world of the Mac, and Windows, and other PCs,
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.900]  even Apple's own platform, the Mac,
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:53.100]  that people are so much more comfortable
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.640]  knowing that they can't, and that it's,
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.540]  and also, they just understand it.
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.380]  It is an understandable closed loop.
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.860]  It's a constant, it's nothing easier than that.
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:05.460]  Right, and you just sort of see it,
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.620]  and here, you have this device in your hand,
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.740]  and you can see all the apps,
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:11.700]  they're there on your home screen,
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.300]  and if you want to get another app that isn't there,
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:18.500]  you know where to go, there's an app for that,
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.260]  and that app is called App Store,
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.340]  and you go into the App Store,
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:26.140]  you sign in with your Apple ID,
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.700]  and they have your credit card,
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:31.220]  and then, from there, you can download other apps
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.600]  and install them, and there's a promise from Apple
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.020]  that has been true, and I know that
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.860]  whatever you do in the App Store,
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:42.020]  whatever you install, is not going to mess up your device.
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:45.580]  It's technically, and both through technical measures
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.980]  at the computer science level with sandboxing
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:52.980]  and permissions, as you know, at a,
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.340]  like I said, like at a computer science level,
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.820]  there are protections in place,
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.260]  and then there are policy protections in place
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:02.940]  that are enforced by the guidelines of the App Store
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:05.820]  that you're not gonna end up with some kind of
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.580]  invisible background demon running
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:09.940]  all the time on your phone,
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.720]  and you don't even know what you did,
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.780]  but at some point, you installed something,
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.660]  and without even launching the app,
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:17.600]  every time you restart your phone,
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.500]  it's already draining your battery
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.380]  at twice the rate that it should be.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:23.860]  That just, it doesn't happen,
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:26.180]  and people are so hesitant.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.900]  And nobody's downloading Pokemon
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.820]  or Fortnite bootlegs off of, like,
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:34.340]  and APKs that are malware-ing them.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.720]  Right, you never start getting pop-up ads
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.060]  from some application.
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.920]  It's somewhere in the background on your phone.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.540]  There's so many things that happen to Macs and Windows PCs
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:47.340]  that cannot happen, and how central that is
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.820]  to the appeal of the platform for users.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:53.780]  And I get it where if, in some alternate universe,
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.300]  there were, Apple made two kinds of phones.
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.860]  They made the iPhone, which is the iPhone as we know it,
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.940]  and they made a Mac phone, for lack of a better word.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.500]  And the Mac phone had a, was more like the Mac
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:09.380]  in terms of, oh, you can just download.apps from the web
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.660]  and unzip them, and they'll, you know,
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.180]  drag them to the applications folder on your Mac phone,
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.980]  and now you've got third-party applications that go through.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:20.500]  I, whether it, if that were an operating system
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.980]  you could just install on the identical hardware,
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.620]  or if it was a different device you had to buy,
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:27.260]  that's what I would buy from Apple.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:29.860]  I would, but I'm not a typical user.
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:31.500]  I'm not even vaguely close to a typical user.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.100]  No, same, 100%, same.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.380]  Like, I personally, I'm a fan of sideloading.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.700]  If I had my druthers, I would like to sideload everything
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.220]  and have complete control over everything,
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.180]  but I recognize that with these things,
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.260]  we have to talk about solutions that don't just apply to us,
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.700]  but that apply to the market,
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.160]  and the market is often very different
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.260]  than the just us part of it.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:51.220]  Right, and I, and you, I'm sure,
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:53.700]  and I'm sure many, many, if not most of the people
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.140]  who listen to my show, effectively do a form
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:58.860]  of sideloading already through TestFlight,
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.880]  where I've got at least a few apps on my phone at all times
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:02.980]  that aren't from the App Store,
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.460]  they're directly from developers
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:06.500]  through Apple's TestFlight system,
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:09.800]  including apps that couldn't be on the App Store
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.720]  because they would violate, you know,
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.420]  certain rules or whatever.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.320]  But I'm, you know, to me, it's a,
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.440]  it's not the worst place where the platform could be
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.520]  in terms of balancing the needs of most people
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:28.320]  versus allowing power users, for lack of a term,
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.560]  to go outside the App Store for things.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.400]  And I don't think that-
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.240]  I've talked about this part before, too.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.540]  Like, my parents are super smart.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:36.560]  Like, they're engineers and, like, professors,
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.560]  and they love the iPad because it was, like,
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.320]  just super simple, there was no complexity to it at all,
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:42.620]  and now whenever I go over, like,
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.680]  I'll take out their iPad, and there's, like,
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.960]  800 versions of the mail thing along the dock,
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.280]  and there's, like, they're pulling the apps out
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.640]  when they try to do it, and it's just like,
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.200]  I just want my iPad back.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.300]  And that's not even, like, to the point of a Mac,
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.280]  it's just that people have been complaining so often
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.500]  that it's not a pro device,
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.740]  and Apple's solution isn't to say make the Mac better,
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:00.960]  it's to keep making the iPad more complicated.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.980]  And I see the same dynamic unfolding eventually
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:04.160]  with the iPhone, where it's just
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.280]  the people who loved it for what it was,
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.720]  it's like, you know, like, you date somebody,
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:08.560]  and you're like, I love them,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.720]  but I just wanna change them,
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.000]  and then you change them, and you're like,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.440]  I don't like them at all anymore.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.280]  That's what it feels like.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.320]  I've given up on that a long time ago, Rene.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.280]  Yep, yep, but that's, like, the cliche.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.920]  But I know, but I do know, but I know exactly what you mean,
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.560]  and that is true.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.460]  I just feel that what the EU has regulated here
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.160]  with this DMA, at least insofar as it pertains
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.100]  to Apple and iOS and their stewardship of iOS,
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.640]  and by iOS, I mean both on the iPhone and iPad,
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.280]  is misguided, and I don't think,
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.640]  I don't think the things that they think they're gonna solve
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.100]  this law solves at all,
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.800]  and I think if they wanted to solve those things
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.120]  and enforce some measure of increased competition,
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.720]  and I certainly have complaints, you know,
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.880]  I'm on a record since forever
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.800]  that I think it's absurd and outright offensive
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.020]  that one of the rules of the App Store
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.600]  is that apps cannot explain the rules
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.280]  of the App Store within the app.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.280]  So when you first launch Netflix on your iPhone
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.460]  and you don't have an account for Netflix yet,
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:14.280]  they can't tell you that you have to go
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.120]  to Netflix.com to sign up.
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.280]  They can't even tell you to go there to sign up,
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.600]  let alone make it an actual link that would take you there,
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.760]  although maybe Netflix as a reader app could,
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.920]  you know, maybe that's an exception,
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.640]  but there's any other way.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.840]  It's as dumb as the Twitter thing over the weekend.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.840]  Right, but exactly, not allowing you to put a link
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.520]  to Mastodon in your Twitter account.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.240]  Well, Apple's been rocking that way from the beginning.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.600]  What makes Twitter's thing seem goofy
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:42.520]  and Apple's just patently offensive
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.240]  is that at least Apple's thing has been that way
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.620]  from the get-go, whereas Twitter is in and of the open web.
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.440]  It is, in some people's minds, you know,
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.400]  it's a website with apps, you know,
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.360]  not just a closed app ecosystem.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.400]  I think that the fact that Apple has these restrictions,
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.600]  I think that the competition, at the very least,
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.880]  should be between, okay, in app,
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.680]  you get to have all the convenience of doing it in app
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.240]  and it's right here and using your saved credit card
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.240]  and using customers' trust of the Apple purchase system
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:23.120]  or you could steer them to your website and say,
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.120]  or, you know, you can pay, you know,
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.040]  again, just toss Twitter out there as an idea
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.060]  where Twitter's thing, where they have this new Twitter
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:34.560]  Blue subscription and in app it costs $11 a month
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:37.480]  but you can go to the web and sign up on your Twitter account
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.220]  for just $8 a month to compensate
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.240]  for the 30% Apple is taking.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.960]  They should be able to tell you that right in the app.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.400]  They should say, here, if you wanna sign up right here
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.200]  in app and use your Apple account, it's $11 a month,
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.680]  tap here and if you would prefer to pay $8 a month,
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.140]  tap here and it'll jump you out to Safari
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.560]  and you could sign up there and let people compete
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.320]  and if too many people for Apple's taste
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.800]  are saving the $3 a month by jumping out,
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.000]  well then that's the competition that might get them
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.320]  to lower the 70-30 split to something
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:12.480]  where they wouldn't do it.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:16.440]  But that's, if the regulation took targeted measures
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.360]  like that, bull's eyes, you know,
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.160]  and say, this is a specific problem we have,
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.040]  okay, I wouldn't be complaining.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.340]  I would say this is actually
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:27.000]  where government regulation helps
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.680]  but you have to allow sideloading in third-party app stores?
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.520]  I'm not with it.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.400]  How do you see it coming?
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:39.040]  I think that Apple's going to take every measure they can
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.340]  to make this as unpleasant as possible
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.960]  within the confines of the law
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:46.060]  and have so many warnings and stuff
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:49.400]  that it will ultimately wind up as a thing
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.800]  that they spend a lot of engineering time
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.180]  to make sure it technically works and is possible
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:57.660]  to comply with the law but which effectively
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:00.280]  nobody is actually going to use.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.520]  Most users won't turn it on
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:05.340]  and very few, if any, major companies
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.980]  will actually go the route of putting their games
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.360]  or other apps into a third-party app store
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.960]  or creating a third-party app store
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:15.040]  or allowing them to be signed.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.640]  Yeah, I think, well. What do you think?
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.760]  So I hate saying this
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.020]  because like we've talked about this before
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:23.180]  but when Apple said we're gonna double our services revenue
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.300]  by, I forget what the date was, 2020,
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.800]  I think that was a fundamental shift
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:27.760]  where for the first time,
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.040]  user experienced like a backseat to revenue
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.080]  and we started seeing all these
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.680]  like push notification marketing ads
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.880]  and ads being put more on the platform
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.800]  and a lot of the things that gets Apple in trouble
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.640]  even though it's not like a major part
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:39.800]  of their revenue stream
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.880]  and I think this shapes, colors a lot of that
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.120]  because we saw in the testimony
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.720]  that when Tim Cook was talking
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:48.280]  that he said like whether you're in the app store or not,
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.840]  it's gonna make it just harder for you to give us our 30%
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.940]  which people like sort of were stunned that he'd say that
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.980]  but I think this is the same thing.
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:57.560]  Like Apple will put in some form of gatekeeper
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.360]  like the same sort of functionality we have
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.960]  on macOS right now
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.020]  but maybe there'll be a fee imposed
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.840]  for getting a signed certificate from Apple
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.160]  and you'll have to have a signed certificate
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.960]  to run on the app store
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:10.800]  or maybe they'll be like,
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.400]  here's the form to submit your 30%
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.560]  for running on an iOS device.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.600]  Like it's gonna be like something
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.880]  that's gonna make a whole bunch of people on,
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:20.260]  like I don't think people are gonna be as happy about it
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:21.160]  as they think they are
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:23.000]  and I don't think it's gonna be as easy
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.880]  and I think also to your point,
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.600]  we've seen how this works out on Android.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.440]  We've seen Epic say
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.740]  that it doesn't work out well for them on Android
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:32.520]  and I don't think that Apple is gonna go out of their way
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:35.720]  to make it easier or better results for Epic
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.080]  who by the way is involved in a huge lawsuit right now
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.040]  for the stuff that they're worried about,
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.080]  the 30% they want is for their V-bucks.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.160]  I don't think they'll make it much easier.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:44.980]  I keep going back to this.
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:47.400]  It reminds me of the battle between a casino
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.320]  and a city council in Las Vegas
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.680]  and I just wish both of those things
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:54.280]  didn't really exist but I understand why they're fighting.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.040]  It is curious to me
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.600]  that Android has had sideloading from the get-go
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.440]  and in my opinion as somebody
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.840]  who's owned an Android phone on it
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:05.860]  or every couple years I buy a new one,
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.880]  I think that the way you go about turning it,
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.300]  it's off by default at least on the Android phones
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:14.160]  I've purchased which have been the Pixel phones
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.000]  in recent years.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.040]  It's off by default.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.480]  I think that where you go to turn it on
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.080]  and the language of and number of warnings
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.920]  you have to okay past to get it turned on is appropriate.
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.200]  I don't think it's,
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:33.000]  and yet it's effectively a non-issue in the Android market
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:33.920]  and it's funny.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.320]  That to me is the funniest part about the Epic thing
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.120]  where Epic sued Apple and Google
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.840]  and so they sued Google
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.320]  and their argument against Google
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:46.740]  was basically that they thought those warnings were,
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:49.740]  so they turned off so many people
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:52.500]  that it effectively kept it from working.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.580]  I guess what they want is something,
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:55:00.580]  I mean really, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic about it.
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:03.100]  I really think Epic wanted it to be,
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:06.100]  wants it to be as easy, if not easier
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:07.860]  than modern Mac and Windows.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.940]  Go back 10 years to how easy it was
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:13.380]  to just unzip anything and double-click it and it runs
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:14.220]  and once it's running it can.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.180]  They wanna be the store, they don't really care about,
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.580]  they're upset they're not the gatekeeper
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:19.980]  I think is what it boils down to.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.260]  And that used to be possible on Mac and Windows
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:24.980]  where you could write software
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:27.460]  that would dig hooks into the operating system
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:30.900]  and if you, whether knowing what you got into
[01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:34.200]  or unknowingly, you could wind up running
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.180]  what's effectively a Frankenstein operating system
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:41.740]  where part of what would to me be considered
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:44.920]  part of the system is now from a third party
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:49.000]  that isn't necessarily in conflict with the company
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.700]  that makes or whoever it is who's in charge
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:56.020]  of making the pure version of the operating system
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.220]  but you've got this whole thing running in the background.
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.340]  You know, like Adobe effectively does that, right?
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:05.260]  When you install the Adobe Suite on your Mac,
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:08.940]  part of your Mac is all constantly checking in with Adobe
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:13.580]  and you're effectively running an offshoot of Mac OS
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:17.420]  that's Mac OS with the Adobe Creative Suite.
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.860]  And they keep asking if you wanna install
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:21.680]  the special trust thing that'll increase their trust of you.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.520]  Right.
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:27.340]  You know, and there's pluses and minuses to it, right?
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:31.020]  I mean, Dropbox, certainly in the early days of Dropbox
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:32.660]  when it was super simple, you know,
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.940]  it was a hack though at a technical level.
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:38.260]  It was a complete hack and you were just running
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:40.420]  effectively if you were using Dropbox then,
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:42.880]  you were running a hacked version of Mac OS
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.220]  that had a cloud fold, you know,
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.940]  everything in this folder syncs to a cloud service thing
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.280]  running in the background that wasn't just like an app
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.000]  and you couldn't just command Q and quit it.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.180]  It was, you know, running extensions in the background.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:58.220]  And they, you know, because they engineered it well,
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.740]  that's what made it popular is it's like,
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:00.580]  yeah, I installed it.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:03.320]  And yes, you could uninstall it but it wasn't easy.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.060]  Yes, there's pluses and minuses to that sort of thing
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:09.680]  but the phone to me, so long as we only have
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:12.160]  one phone platform from the company,
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.420]  it shouldn't be that way.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:15.760]  We shall see.
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.280]  All right, let me thank our final sponsor of the episodes,
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.320]  our good friends at Squarespace.

[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.400]  really, really good analytics.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.200]  A clear, great design that lets you see
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.960]  who's coming to your website, where are they coming from,
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.960]  which parts of your website are busy,
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.880]  which parts aren't.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.180]  Online stores, set up a catalog,
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:59.080]  take all, do all the commerce,
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.280]  all the secure stuff you need to do

[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.800]  Custom templates for creating your website.
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.900]  They have so many custom templates
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:11.360]  and they look great across all devices
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.520]  and they are customizable from top to bottom.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.080]  Anything you want to tweak, you can tweak.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:19.440]  You can do it in a totally WYSIWYG fashion
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:23.240]  right in your browser or if you know stuff like CSS
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.100]  and HTML, you can modify it at the code level,
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.000]  be as nerdy or as unnerdy as you want
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.520]  and they have award-winning technical support
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.520]  that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.000]  Just in case you need help with something,

[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:40.540]  If you're a consultant and you build websites
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:42.540]  for your customers, that sort of thing,
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:45.920]  you should really look into maybe doing it on Squarespace
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:47.960]  and then you can just turn it over to the customer
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:49.800]  and they've got one thing to pay for.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.480]  They don't have to pay for a host
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.000]  and then pay for e-commerce and then pay for this
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.160]  or pay for that.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.800]  Just send them to Squarespace, let them do it all there.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:58:59.820]  Get them out of your hair.

[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:41.200]  Well, we've wound up with our Apple December in review.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.480]  Yes, for the last week in review.
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:45.800]  The year in review, again, famous last words.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.720]  I don't know that I have a lot to say.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.560]  There's, you know, come back.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:50.560]  Well, I think you nailed it at the beginning.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.120]  It was like when COVID caught up, COVID and lockdowns
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.920]  and a bunch of other stuff caught up with Apple.
[01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:00.040]  Right and this is not a complaint but I think that it,
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.480]  you know, that they had to prioritize
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.460]  while they were locked down.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.720]  I mean, famously on the hardware front,
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:10.720]  they, it's still mind-blowing to me that when that,
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.160]  I think it was United a couple of years ago
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:18.160]  accidentally leaked somehow and some poor product
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:21.160]  or marketing person at United leaked
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:24.600]  that Apple has a standing order of like, I don't know,
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:29.200]  50 business class seats between SFO and China
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:32.320]  every single day and they don't necessarily
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:36.020]  fill those seats every day but if they wanted to,
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:37.120]  they could.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.620]  Dozens and dozens of people who work for Apple
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.660]  or, you know, in normal times are flying between Apple
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:45.380]  and China every day and probably other places
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:49.140]  around the world now too as Apple is slowly
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:52.800]  sort of trying to break free of the dependence,
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.600]  their dependencies on China but the hardware business
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.920]  is one of, you know, hardware is physical
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.640]  and therefore there are aspects of it
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:05.000]  that require a physical presence of people.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Right, I mean, I think it's fair to say
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  that software is more naturally and easily created
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:19.680]  by a remote team than hardware.
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.480]  Yeah, like even when, like when people talk about
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:23.320]  return to work, that's for software people.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.760]  Hardware people across Silicon Valley have been at work
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.080]  and has met suits for the last two plus years.
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.120]  Right, and I know, you know, some people,
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.440]  I know more software people than hardware people at Apple
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:35.240]  but, you know, during the COVID restrictions
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:38.800]  there were times, you know, and, you know,
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.560]  Apple hints at them here and there
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.440]  but like the machines they have for fabricating,
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.520]  you know, they're effectively very fancy 3D printers
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:50.160]  but ones that can make things out of like aluminum.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:51.000]  All of that.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.320]  Yes, there's, you just can't, I don't know.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:54.440]  I'm sure it'd be fascinating.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.760]  I would love it if Apple someday did some kind,
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:57.960]  you know, and just put it all,
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:00.400]  put it all on like a four year delay or something
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.360]  to keep the latest and greatest out of it
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.600]  but I would love like an Apple TV show
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.720]  that was just behind the scenes at Apple hardware
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:10.040]  and you got to see like, you know, like at this point,
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:11.840]  like if you got to see how they created
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:14.760]  the original AirPods from six years ago, you know,
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:17.840]  and the prototypes they went through and stuff.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.080]  It'd be fascinating but you have to be there, right?
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:21.960]  You can't, you know, if you're working at home,
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.960]  you don't have access to the $10 million CNC machine.
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:26.800]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:29.160]  So, you know, and people had to go in
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:30.960]  and they'd like have like a signup sheet
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.560]  and there'd be one employee at a time
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.440]  who would come in and be in the lab all by themselves
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.000]  and, you know, and then leave and wait for the air to clear
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.200]  before somebody else could come in.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.240]  I mean, it was complicated.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.040]  It would be shocking if somehow the 2020 and 2021 went by
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:48.920]  and Apple hadn't been, like any other company,
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.040]  hindered in some ways
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.840]  and I kind of feel like this is the year
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.680]  where it caught up to them
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:56.600]  and maybe it'll be a while before they're fully unjammed.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:58.640]  I can't help but think that if in a world
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:00.120]  where COVID didn't happen,
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.600]  that I'd like to think that maybe this,
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.880]  the late November or October,
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.680]  whatever it was when they came out with the new iPads,
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.320]  I guess it was October, that, you know,
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:12.560]  and everybody's like, huh, you know,
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:16.520]  the iPad Pros are still kind of unchanged
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.680]  except they go from the M1 to the M2
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.920]  and, you know, there's the fancy pencil support
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:23.720]  where you can hover, you get a hover effect
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:26.000]  and other than that, that's it, you know,
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:26.920]  which isn't bad.
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:29.200]  There's still great, you know,
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.760]  best of class pro tablets
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.360]  but, you know, there are designs that go back to 2018
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.600]  and that's pretty long time for Apple.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:40.360]  Even if the new design that they might have had
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.120]  wouldn't have been a radical departure,
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.800]  you know, clearly the more radical departure
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.200]  was just like with the iPhone 10 for the iPhone,
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.040]  going from the, there's a touch ID home button
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.840]  on the front face to an edge to edge, you know, thing
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.400]  and with the iPad Pros going to face ID
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.840]  or with the iPad Air and now the regular iPad
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:07.320]  having a touch ID button on the side
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:08.520]  instead of on the front face
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.440]  because there's no more room on the front face.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:15.840]  I don't think there's a new iPad design that radical
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:16.960]  that would have been due this year
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.920]  but something, you know, a little new.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.400]  I can't help but feel that we'd be have more of the Macs,
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.000]  you know, or second levels, second versions
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.840]  of certain Macs out already, you know.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.000]  Like the iPad thing, like to me,
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.880]  I want, now that Apple is fully in control
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.080]  of their own chip destiny,
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  I want them to always update to the new chip.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  Like just, even if they're not changing anything,
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.320]  just put the new chip in it
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.880]  and people will say, well, you shouldn't,
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.920]  like why upgrade every year?
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.480]  I'm not gonna upgrade every year
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:45.200]  but every year somebody is going to
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.680]  and I feel like it very much like I feel like a bakery.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.040]  Even though I'm not buying fresh bread every day,
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.640]  any day I go to the bakery, there should be fresh bread.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.080]  I don't wanna go and buy an iPad
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.800]  that has a two-year-old processor in it
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.120]  just because there's no redesign.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.560]  Like just put the new spec, like the new parts in
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:01.040]  any year you have the new parts.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.400]  So every year that I buy them,
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.920]  I get the best version of that for the money that I can
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:08.520]  but the Mac stuff, like when Steve Jobs
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.040]  announced the transition to Intel,
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:11.440]  he said it would take two years.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.120]  They got it done in about a year.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.320]  Tim Cook made the same two-year promise.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:16.160]  They're not done.
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.920]  Like we still don't have an Apple Silicon Mac Pro.
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:20.560]  And when you look at the timeline,
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:23.240]  like it's evident just based on the specs of the machines
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.760]  that several of these things came out months later
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.520]  than Apple originally planned them to.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:30.120]  And that whole timeline just got stretched out.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.760]  And I think that is like, if not for COVID,
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:35.160]  I think we would have gotten a lot of those products earlier
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.480]  and we would have gotten to that Mac Pro by now
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.920]  and they would have just nailed that transition.
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:42.040]  Yeah, and it's funny.
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:45.440]  And I feel almost feel bad for like Tom Boger in particular,
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.400]  who's, you know, was the one who is sort of tasked
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.440]  with when they rejuvenated the Mac mini
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.280]  of telling us in the press.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.080]  And you know, you had a great interview with him,
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.480]  but you know, telling us, hey, you know,
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.920]  there've been stretches where the Mac mini didn't get
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:03.920]  updates in the Intel era, but we've never lost sight
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.200]  of what a great product it is.
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.880]  And we know how so many of our customers,
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:11.440]  our pro Mac users, have these very pro uses
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:14.000]  for this very small desktop Mac.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.080]  I think that the shape of the Mac studio
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:20.360]  shows how committed they are to that sort of form factor,
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:22.400]  right, where we'll just take the same footprint,
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.600]  but we'll make it taller because it's, you know,
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:27.600]  got super pro, very, very serious pro specs.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.560]  But here we are now over two years after the M1 Mac mini.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:35.200]  And if you want to get a Mac mini,
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.760]  you're still getting the one from the end of 2020.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:39.240]  And now Apple's in charge.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.960]  I don't think that was their plan all along.
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.800]  I think-
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:42.640]  Nope.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.000]  I think without COVID, you know,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.200]  we would have had something else in between, possibly,
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:50.040]  you know, more than just go from the M1 to M2,
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.480]  but at least go from the M1 to M2.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.960]  COVID and TSMC is starting to feel what Intel felt
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.520]  a few years ago in terms of die shrink,
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.760]  like process shrinks and yield rates.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.320]  Right.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.680]  So they had to prioritize.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.240]  They had to prioritize and, you know,
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.040]  what bubbled to the top of their priorities in that stretch,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:10.160]  you know, and again, I'm sure that was all in the timeline,
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.760]  but they did, this was over a year ago though.
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:15.360]  So it's not a 2022 year in review thing.
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.680]  It's the late 2021 MacBook Pros,
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:22.040]  the 14 inch and 16 inch MacBook Pros,
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:24.560]  which me as a, that's my main machine,
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.320]  a 14 inch M2 MacBook Pro.
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:28.160]  I love it.
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.880]  I can't say enough good things about it.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:30.720]  I love it.
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:32.200]  It's great.
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.720]  It kind of boggles my mind though,
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:35.880]  that one of the rumors earlier this year
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:37.680]  was that they'd have new ones already
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.880]  at the end of this year.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.080]  And, you know, and I was just sort of like, hmm.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.120]  I mean, ideally, I guess it would be nice
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:47.000]  if it was on a 12 month schedule
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.640]  and you could count on it the way we do the phone.
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:52.440]  My skepticism and, you know, it turns out I was right.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.000]  There are no, there were no new MacBook Pros this year,
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.800]  but my thought was, well, wait,
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:58.840]  with all these other machines we haven't seen yet,
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:01.480]  why would they put that one up
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:05.000]  when those are actually relatively fresh, right?
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.400]  There's no new Mac Mini yet.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:11.440]  The Mac Pro we literally haven't seen yet, so.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.240]  The iMac Pros still in another world
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.080]  where they're trying to figure out
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:15.160]  if the studio solves for that
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:17.280]  or if they still need to make it.
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.940]  Yeah, and I get it that it's not like
[02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:21.880]  there's 12 people working for John Turnus
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.600]  and they're, you know, those 12 people
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.840]  have to put all these Mac hardware devices out there
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:31.680]  and they're not, you know, there's different hundreds
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:33.680]  and hundreds if not thousands of people working
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.760]  on Apple's Mac hardware in parallel,
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.360]  but it just seemed like with the pace of all the other Macs
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.000]  that I would have been very surprised,
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.360]  very surprised if October's introductions
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:48.780]  included M2 MacBook Pros,
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:51.420]  because I just didn't see them as being there.
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:53.840]  So, you know, I don't think it's a disappointing year
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.680]  for Mac hardware.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:59.560]  I think what shows is that the single most important Mac,
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.040]  it's obvious, Apple doesn't have to tell us this,
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:04.760]  it's the MacBook Air, and it's a, you know,
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.600]  they got a great update to the MacBook Air
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:09.160]  out over the summer.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:13.260]  I know firsthand, because I had a high school senior
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:16.360]  last year, now college freshman,
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.480]  with lots of friends and, you know,
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.560]  including some friends who basically knew what I do
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.880]  and, you know, were like, hey, ask your dad what should,
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:27.240]  you know, I'm thinking about waiting, you know,
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:29.800]  before the MacBook Airs were announced,
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.760]  I'm thinking about waiting to order a laptop for college
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.640]  and I'd say, yeah, tell your friends to wait,
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:37.920]  because, you know, everybody knew it was sort of coming
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.920]  and then WWDC came and they announced it
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:42.360]  and, you know, they hadn't even graduated yet
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.200]  and they were like, oh, and then they're all, you know,
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:47.120]  it's just unbelievable how many times my son said to me,
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.200]  oh, and so-and-so just bought a MacBook Air,
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.040]  somebody else just bought their MacBook Air,
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  they all bought MacBook Airs for college,
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.600]  so they got it out on time for the, you know,
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.680]  at least, I know that like for institutional education
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:02.000]  buyers, the buying schedule is earlier in the year,
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.280]  I think it's like more like April,
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.880]  where that's sort of the cutoff for the schools to budget
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:12.160]  for their purchase for next year, but for like individuals,
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.160]  and you know, it's like a rite of passage,
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:16.760]  you graduate high school, if you head into college,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.480]  you get a new laptop, maybe it's your graduation present,
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:22.480]  they hit that, and I, you know, all kudos to Apple,
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:27.200]  I think that was a very important milestone to hit.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:30.640]  It's a weird time for Apple to ship Mac hardware,
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.000]  I can't remember many hardware introductions
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.960]  that were made at WWDC and were shipping soon, right,
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:38.800]  like the-
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:41.160]  Except for 2017, John, I still remember that,
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.920]  they announced, what was it, all the new iMacs,
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.880]  all the new MacBook Airs, all the new,
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:48.680]  well, they were just spec bumped MacBook Pros,
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.720]  and we went into the, it was at the hotel,
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.200]  we went to the next hotel, and they're like,
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.000]  here are your review units, and you're just like,
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.080]  I've got stuff to do, I can't take four computers with me,
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:00.440]  sorry, and I took them across the street to the hotel.
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.240]  I do remember that, and I was like,
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.880]  how am I gonna get all this stuff home, I can't do this.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:10.400]  So what else did happen?
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:15.120]  So March was the all new Mac Studio and Studio Display,
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.120]  new iPad Air, the new iPhone SE, and the green iPhones.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.400]  I don't have strong opinions on the Mac Studio,
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.040]  because it's not a machine for me.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:25.880]  I love it.
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:29.200]  But the people I know who have it seem to really like it.
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.840]  The Mac Studio Display, though, I do have,
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.800]  and absolutely love, it is up there,
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:38.000]  I would say my product of the year from Apple,
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.360]  it's probably a tie between the Mac Studio Display,
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.480]  with, I splurged, I got, maxed it out,
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.960]  I got the nanotexture surface,
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:50.200]  and the fancy $500 stand, I think it's 500,
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.160]  whatever it costs me.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.720]  But I actually do use the adjustable stand.
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.000]  I move it up and down a little sometimes,
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.160]  and it's a very nice stand.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.840]  But the nanotexture glass, I think I spoke about it
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.560]  on this show an episode or two ago,
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:07.440]  but it's unbelievably, I was about to say life-changing,
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.000]  I guess not life-changing, but.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:11.840]  Now, if you're a Mac nerd and you've been waiting
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.520]  for something that has actually like,
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.960]  pixels are on the grid, that's like all we wanted
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:19.200]  was a display where pixels are actually on the grid.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:22.560]  Well, but for me personally, in my home office
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.040]  with south-facing windows, the nanotexture
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.920]  is so unbelievably good at dealing with
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:35.880]  not just like oblique reflections or tough lighting,
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:40.120]  I mean like direct sunlight in every April
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:42.880]  and every October, that's the time of year
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.800]  where in the middle of the afternoon,
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:48.040]  my prime working hours, the sunlight streams in my window
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:53.040]  and is right on the display, and my only option literally
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:56.800]  before I had this nanotexture display
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.720]  was to just take a break for an hour until the sun moved,
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.680]  or which might mean pick up my MacBook
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.840]  and go upstairs to our kitchen or go somewhere else
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:08.720]  where I sit somewhere else.
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:11.440]  But I literally could not see the display.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  And because I had the review unit
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.480]  of the regular studio display with the glossy finish
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:22.960]  in April, so the two times a year from my home office
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:25.440]  where the sunlight hits are April and October,
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:28.280]  in April I had the glossy one, and I literally,
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.800]  for about 90 minutes an afternoon on a sunny day,
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.800]  I could not use it, and by, I forget when my nanotexture one
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:40.800]  arrived, but sometime over the summer, June or July,
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:43.680]  I don't know, by the time October rolled around,
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.520]  I had it, and there were times where I'd be like,
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:50.240]  wait, is this display in direct sunlight?
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.680]  And I'd hold my hand up like Indiana Jones
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.560]  testing the booby trap in Raiders of the Lost Ark,
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:59.040]  and yes, it is full-on sunlight,
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.800]  and I can still see the display with no reflection at all.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.920]  It's just perfectly usable.
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.720]  Amazing, great product.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:08.200]  I bought one too, I had a review unit,
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.800]  and I still bought one, and I love it.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:11.840]  The only thing I disagree about is I think
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.040]  they should have put the center stage camera in the iMac,
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.800]  because I think that's much more of a family product
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:18.280]  where it would benefit from people getting up
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.040]  and walking around and putting it in liver
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:22.840]  and lungs and kitchens, and put the 1080p webcam in here,
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:26.240]  because I just, that camera is so bad,
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.880]  I've put a Canon Cine camera on top of it instead.
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:32.400]  I just covered it up with an actual real camera,
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:34.640]  because I couldn't take that camera anywhere.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:39.000]  I do not like the camera, and I complained about it,
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.440]  and it is what it is.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:44.320]  I guess I see what Apple was thinking,
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.160]  but like you said, I don't think that the market
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.080]  for a pro studio display, I know the word pro
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:51.560]  isn't in the studio display name,
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:54.320]  but to me it's a pro product at pro prices.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:56.200]  And it goes with the studio, the Mac Studio,
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.080]  which is a pro device.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.680]  Right, it should have a camera whose number one goal
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:03.760]  is image quality for whatever their budget was.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:06.640]  If they said, here's our budget for the camera component,
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.600]  they should have optimized for image quality,
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.920]  and if that meant that you had to sit still
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.520]  right in front of the center of the camera,
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.560]  like you do with just about every other camera in the world,
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:17.040]  then I think that would be fine,
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:18.960]  and would have been more appropriate for the product
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.360]  than to use this ultra-wide angle camera
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:26.280]  with significantly lower image quality,
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.760]  but because it's ultra-wide angle supports center stage
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:33.000]  because it can crop wherever you are as you go around.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.440]  I don't think that feature is appropriate for the product.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.400]  Ideally, you'd have both, right?
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.920]  It would be great to magically have center stage
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:44.600]  and amazing image quality,
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:46.940]  but I feel like they made the wrong trade-off there,
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:50.840]  but I've moved past it by just, I have an Opal C1,
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:54.200]  I don't do many video things, but it is what it is.
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.640]  You do it for me on occasion, I appreciate it.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:01.000]  I do, I do, but I don't use my studio display.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.580]  The only other thing I'm really interested in
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:05.520]  is because it runs iOS, it'd be better if it had Wi-Fi,
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.120]  but even if it doesn't, it connects to a Mac and runs iOS,
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:10.160]  is I'm hoping, or I'm wondering if we'll get
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:11.720]  software updates for it the way
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:13.400]  that we get them for the AirPods,
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.840]  because before that, headphones never got software updates,
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.400]  and now we're almost used to getting
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.800]  yearly updates for our headphones,
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.680]  and I wonder if at some point Apple's gonna say,
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:22.200]  here's an update that adds,
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:23.760]  I don't know, if you have two studio displays,
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:26.320]  now it'll make them a paired, like a speaker pairs,
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.520]  or some kind of upgrade.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:31.720]  I wonder, I haven't gotten a, I have not gotten
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:36.160]  a firmware update in months, many, many, many months.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:37.720]  There were a couple earlier in the year,
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:40.040]  but it seems like it's settled down, it's been a while.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:42.140]  The other thing that I ran into earlier,
[02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:44.560]  I forget if it ever happened once I got the nano texture,
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:47.920]  I think it happened at least once I got my personal one,
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:50.320]  as opposed to the review unit that I sent back,
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.000]  but there were problems early on in the first few months
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.060]  after it came out where your audio would get garbled,
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:03.060]  and it was in fact a software problem on the iOS computer
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.800]  that is secretly embedded, you know,
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:10.120]  a studio display is actually an iOS computer.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:11.840]  Yeah, it's like an iPad 7 or something
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.880]  stuck inside the display.
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.680]  Yeah, it really is, and you know,
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:20.640]  you don't actually use it like a computer,
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.120]  it's not enabled like a computer,
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:25.960]  but it was somehow that the audio subsystem
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:27.960]  on that computer would get garbled,
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:32.960]  and the only way to fix it was to restart the computer.
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:35.840]  But the only way to restart the computer,
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.480]  because it has no power button,
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:39.760]  was to yank the cable out of the wall,
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.720]  or the socket, wherever you have it plugged in,
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:45.880]  which for me meant crawling down on my hands and knees.
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.280]  So the second time I had to do it,
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.040]  I was like, two strikes and you're out,
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:51.800]  in my book, I'm not going down there again.
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:54.800]  So I bought a home kit.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.800]  That's what I did.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:00.920]  So I bought it, Murphy's Law worked perfectly.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.080]  I spent, I don't know, 30, whatever they cost,
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:07.000]  30 or $35 to get the, I forget what brand,
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:09.880]  I don't know, whatever it's called.
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.360]  They sell them at the Apple stores.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.200]  Yeah.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:15.080]  It's nice, it works, and now that I have it set up,
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:16.840]  I haven't had to use it.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:17.680]  Yeah.
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:18.560]  But all I wanted to be able to do
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:20.400]  is instead of crawling on my hands and knees,
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:23.840]  just go into the home app, turn that socket off,
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.640]  turn it back on to restart the display
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:27.920]  without going down there, but once I installed it,
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:29.520]  I've never had to use it, so.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.000]  Same thing.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.520]  Murphy wins again.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.360]  Yeah.
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:36.240]  What's next after, oh, here it is,
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.040]  the Eve Energy Smart Plug and Power, Eve, E-V-E.
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.440]  I can recommend it, I actually like the product a lot.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.200]  It's $40 though, I have to say, it's more than $30.
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:47.520]  Yeah.
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.000]  So there are 40, so I spent $40 on a plug
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.600]  just to get Murphy's Law to kick in
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:54.760]  so I'd never need to unplug my studio display again.
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:55.600]  But anyway, great product.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:56.440]  We appreciate it.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:57.440]  I don't think there was much,
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  I don't have much from Apple's calendar
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:02.640]  in between those product announcements in WWDC.
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.440]  No, same, I was just looking again.
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:05.880]  It's like they did a lot of stuff,
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.880]  like they sunsetted the iPod.
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.680]  That is true, that was sad.
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.520]  Yeah.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:14.080]  But, you know, they had a good run.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:18.440]  WWDC in hindsight, I guess what stands out
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:22.440]  is it was the first big thing that was back to real life
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.560]  and it was good to see.
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:27.320]  It'll be interesting to see, I presume,
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.880]  and I don't know anybody who's betting otherwise,
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.000]  that this year's, or next year's, I guess it still is,
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.760]  2023's WWDC will be similar,
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.860]  where I do not believe that they're going to go back
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:42.200]  to the San Jose Convention Center
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.040]  and have in-person sessions.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:46.680]  I think sessions, the week of content,
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.840]  the actual developer content,
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:52.600]  has forever moved towards these pre-recorded things
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:54.400]  and I think everybody's happier that way.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:56.320]  It sounds to me like my developer friends
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.760]  actually like them better.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:00.040]  I think that it means that there are sessions,
[02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:04.200]  if there's a session with 16 minutes of content,
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:05.760]  it's a 16-minute session.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.960]  It doesn't have to go to 30 because you need,
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:10.840]  you know, programming the physical conferences
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:13.120]  like programming a TV network
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:17.360]  where everything has to be in half-hour increments, you know?
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.960]  So you can, and you could have a 35-minute session
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:22.480]  and you could blow past the half-hour mark if you want to.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.240]  It's very liberating.
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:29.240]  I think that the actual Apple employees who perform,
[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:31.160]  for lack of a better word, the sessions,
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:36.160]  I think as people who are full-time engineers
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:40.000]  and not stage professionals,
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.700]  they're clearly so much more comfortable on camera
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.920]  than they are on stage, right?
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.560]  I mean, people, you know, anybody who's ever spoke,
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:52.140]  I mean, famously, public speaking in front of a crowd
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:53.880]  is the number one phobia people have
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:55.680]  and it makes all the sense in the world
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.800]  where evolutionarily, we evolved to the point
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:02.560]  where if hundreds of people all have their attention on you,
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:04.820]  you are in terrible danger.
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:07.400]  That's the way we evolved.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:08.640]  It was so much more error-prone too
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:10.280]  because everything was live and there were some sessions
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.400]  where people were like walking and you'd hear the mic
[02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:14.760]  just scratching along their clothes or their hair
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.640]  the entire time and because it was live,
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:18.080]  they couldn't do anything about it.
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:19.720]  These are all like beautifully produced.
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:22.160]  They can do multiple takes if they need to.
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.800]  They can do a lot of production value.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:27.040]  It's so much better, like mutual friend Alex Lindsay said,
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.840]  like you start with online first
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:31.340]  and then you add the physical components.
[02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:33.480]  That just makes, it's so much better for everybody
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.440]  all over the world that way.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:38.660]  Yeah, so it seems win-win-win.
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:42.560]  Other than the camaraderie of being together for a week
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:45.720]  with your fellow developer friends and media people
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:50.720]  for the whole week, I'd be flabbergasted
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:52.880]  if it were to change, to be honest.
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.400]  They still had a good amount of developers.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:57.360]  We saw people like day after day after day
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:58.440]  and the other thing I really liked
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:00.800]  because I went straight from WWDC to VidCon,
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:03.760]  which is one of the big, it's not run by YouTube,
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:05.520]  but it's like a lot of YouTubers and TikTokers
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.440]  and people there.
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.160]  This was before I joined YouTube
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:11.600]  and like Apple was so conscientious about health and safety
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:14.440]  during that event that I did not see any headlines.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:16.880]  Whereas like people were calling it COVID Con
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.460]  by the end of the other one.
[02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:22.200]  It was just like such a stark difference
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.040]  in terms of like how considerate they were the entire time.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.840]  The only gamble is the rain, right?
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:34.240]  Because one of the ways that Apple designed a very COVID
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:39.240]  friendly WWDC in June was that the seating for the keynote,
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.260]  the keynote was the big mass event, right?
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:43.200]  That's where there were, I don't know,
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:44.920]  2,000 people, something like that,
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:46.320]  or at least over a thousand.
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:47.360]  It was outdoors.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.520]  So that's number one thing you can do
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:50.880]  to make something safer.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:54.880]  The food and stuff like that was in their cafeteria,
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:56.640]  which has big doors that opened up.
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:58.060]  So it was still open air.
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:00.000]  In hindsight, it does seem like,
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.800]  I don't know anybody who thinks they caught COVID at WWDC.
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:06.640]  It doesn't seem to have been any kind of spreader.
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:07.600]  So I think that's a win.
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:09.820]  I think the only question I have going forward
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:11.600]  is can they make it bigger?
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.280]  Can they invite more people?
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:15.700]  I mean, because there is,
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:18.600]  it is curious that it worked as well as it did.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:21.200]  And speaking to some of the people at Apple
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:24.100]  who were involved in planning it,
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:27.380]  it really is the truth that that part of Apple Park
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:31.720]  was never designed with what if we ever wanna host
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:35.640]  1,500 or 2,000 outsiders
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:40.640]  for a live outdoor keynote outside the ring.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:45.680]  It wasn't designed for that, but it worked great,
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:47.520]  other than the fact that the sun was so bright
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:49.560]  that some people did get sunburned.
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:51.720]  Sunburn was the worst thing that seemed to happen from it.
[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:53.860]  I don't know how much bigger they could get it, though,
[02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:56.720]  given the limits of that lawn space there.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:58.380]  Yeah, and they gave out sunscreen and stuff
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:00.320]  in the little bags, so it was,
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:04.080]  they tried their best, and hats and all sorts of things.
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.480]  I met one fellow who, he says,
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.440]  and it's such a bad sunburn on half of his face.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:14.080]  He really was like the Harvey Dent type sunburn.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.100]  Oh, Sam from iUpdate was bright red,
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:18.080]  like neon bright red.
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.440]  Well, this guy was, and he was like,
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.440]  and I did, I used the sunscreen.
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.800]  I had it all over my face, and this still happened to me
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:27.880]  because he was Canadian, you know, he's very fair-skinned.
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:30.440]  It was unusually sunny for Cupertino,
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:33.200]  but the funny part is that if it had rained,
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.640]  there was no plan B.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:37.140]  There was no, there is no canopy that would cover that.
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.720]  We would have all been soaked, I guess, I don't know.
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:43.560]  It rains infrequently enough in Cupertino
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:47.360]  that I guess it's worth taking the gamble,
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:48.200]  but everybody, I didn't get there.
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.600]  Although it means a lot when I'm there, John,
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.500]  and I think it's because I bring
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:52.800]  Canadian low-pressure systems with me.
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:54.060]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:56.040]  It does seem like something that would happen to you,
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:57.080]  but it did rain.
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:00.160]  I think it was the Friday before WWDC's Monday keynote.
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.200]  It rained pretty bad, and they were like,
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:03.040]  huh, this is, you know.
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:03.880]  As soon as I arrived.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:05.040]  This is what we were hoping would happen,
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.240]  but I would guess what we'll see this year
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:10.000]  is a replay of last year's, maybe a little bigger,
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.840]  but I don't know how much bigger they can make it,
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.720]  but I think Apple considered it a success,
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:16.800]  and so I think it's probably the new model
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:17.640]  for WWDC to go for.
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.760]  And the developer center was an amazing addition
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.140]  to the whole system.
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:24.120]  What else happened to WWDC?
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:27.160]  I mean, we don't have to rehash the software announcements.
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:29.120]  I do think, I guess the one thing I'll say
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.960]  about the software announcements is it does seem to me,
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:35.600]  I mean, again, this is kind of obvious to everybody
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:38.880]  that Apple has sort of, under Craig Federighi,
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:43.880]  has moved from a, all the major features come out
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:48.320]  in the integer.0 update in the fall,
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:50.360]  and whether they're ready or not,
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:51.680]  or however buggy they are,
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:54.240]  and then we'll fix them as best we can until June
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:57.040]  when we start it all over again with next year's thing.
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.020]  They have, the first step under Federighi in recent years
[02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:06.020]  in terms of annualizing their schedule
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.240]  was just getting all of the platforms
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:09.880]  to have once a year updates, right?
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:12.600]  It wasn't that long ago when really only,
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:14.320]  you could only count on the iPhone,
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.140]  getting a new.0 integer OS update every year,
[02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:20.920]  and sometimes the Mac got one, and sometimes it didn't.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:24.760]  I know many Mac fans would probably right now,
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:26.640]  listening to me talk here, are like,
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:28.080]  yeah, I wish they'd go back to that
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:32.240]  and take every year off and just let them bake for a while.
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:34.960]  They're not often very big ones anymore.
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:37.260]  They're mostly just to keep up sync pace,
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:40.920]  like to make sure the apps can still sync between devices.
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.160]  Yeah, I think so too.
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.760]  I think that you should take,
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:47.600]  people who wish that they would take it slower and focus,
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:50.300]  spend more time focusing on bug fixes
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:52.640]  and rather than adding new stuff.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.560]  I think that starting with, what was last year's, High Sierra?
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:00.000]  This year's was Ventura, and last year was?
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.040]  High Sierra, well, I don't know the numbers,
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:04.440]  but when they first switched to Mac OS 11,
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:07.800]  when they broke out of the everything is 10 point what,
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:11.320]  and they redesigned the look of it, and they,
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.720]  Monterey, all right, so with Mac OS 11 Monterey,
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:16.720]  they gave it a whole new look,
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:21.280]  like a sort of a second attempt at the iOS 7 style
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:25.720]  interface for the Mac, and I would say going from 11 to 12,
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:28.720]  and now this just last week I upgraded my main machine
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:32.280]  from 12 to 13 when 13.1 came out.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:36.440]  They're relatively minor, and that the features
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:38.600]  you're getting are things like freeform, right,
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:42.120]  which they have to, I mean, I guess, I say they have to,
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:43.660]  I guess they could come out with a version
[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:46.200]  of the freeform app that works on older Mac OS,
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:49.560]  but I get it why they gate it to the OS,
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:52.220]  and so that they don't have, they're not launching
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:56.280]  this new thing that already has legacy compatibility
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:58.080]  things to worry about.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.160]  I think it's worked pretty well, but to me,
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:02.040]  the second, so the first step was getting
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.280]  all of the major platforms to have a.0 every year
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.880]  to keep it running, and I think it's worked well
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.880]  and has kept them, you know, there's downsides
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:13.480]  to everything, but I think overall it is,
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:16.560]  it's made them more effective, but I think
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:20.640]  that the more recent change is a little more subtle,
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:25.560]  which is that they are just unabashedly unafraid
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:28.640]  to roll out these features that they might talk about
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:31.840]  in June, but not roll them out until December
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:33.480]  or January or February, right?
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.120]  App tracking transparency didn't ship until
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:39.200]  almost the other way around the calendar.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.680]  You know, it was like April before it came out,
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:45.960]  and I also think that is much for the better.
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:48.320]  It's almost gotten them to the point,
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:50.720]  and again, it's Apple's going to be Apple,
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:53.080]  and they're gonna do things the Apple way,
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:56.640]  and if you're purely a web company,
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:01.000]  YouTube, just to name a company you're familiar with,
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.080]  YouTube doesn't have to worry about version numbers outside.
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.960]  Nobody who's just going to YouTube to watch a video
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:11.680]  knows that they're on YouTube version whatever.
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:13.160]  There are no version numbers on a website.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:14.440]  And there's experiments, like you could be
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:16.360]  on a 10% experiment at any given time
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:17.920]  that looks pretty different than what
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:19.640]  everyone else is getting.
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:22.440]  Right, or has different features or stuff like that,
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.080]  and even if it's just as subtle as taking away
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:27.240]  a thumbs down button, and they can roll it out
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:32.240]  and see how it works before rolling it out to everybody.
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:34.640]  Apple's got, in some ways, Apple's going to be
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.800]  Apple company culture-wise, and in other ways,
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:40.120]  Apple has to be a little different because they're
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:43.280]  creating software that runs on your personal device,
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:45.360]  and that's a very different thing,
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.680]  and it has upsides and downsides.
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:49.520]  I think, though, that this new schedule
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:52.280]  where major features show up in the dot one,
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:54.200]  and then the dot two, and then the dot three,
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:57.120]  and even the dot four later in the year
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:01.560]  has made those things so much more solid
[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:04.840]  by the time we actually get our hands on them as users.
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:07.800]  Yeah, I think last year you and I talked about
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:09.840]  the advantages and disadvantages of making them
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.400]  a roadmap announcement rather than
[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:14.360]  a specific data announcement, where you have
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:17.280]  more time to work on things versus you have
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:19.640]  the impetus to get things done that maybe,
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:21.440]  having a deadline is still a really good thing,
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:23.780]  and I think they've gotten the best of both worlds now,
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:26.140]  where they come out and they say, this is iOS,
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:27.940]  and they have a set of things that they know
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:30.060]  they have to deliver, and they have compatibility issues
[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:32.000]  and all these different things, but they also
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.400]  can now stage things out and even introduce them
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:36.720]  so they get some time so they can get
[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:39.160]  their messaging out on it, and then they know
[02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:41.320]  the part they're gonna deliver on that day
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:43.760]  in September for the iPhone, October for the Mac
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.640]  and the iPad now, and then they've also said
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:48.200]  this is coming later in the year or it's coming
[02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:50.280]  early next year, and that gives them the ability
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.640]  to not have to, because previously they would just say,
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:54.880]  oh, it's delayed, it's delayed, that always looks bad,
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.520]  and this just lets them have a little bit more breathing
[02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:58.420]  with one of those announcements.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:00.640]  Yeah, I think they're more comfortable
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.560]  and I think the features ship in better shape.
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:06.540]  I think it's underappreciated how much,
[02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:11.540]  how good their software management must be
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:16.480]  to keep rolling, to keep that annual train rolling
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:20.000]  and not get around to the point where,
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.920]  I don't think it's any surprise that probably
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:26.060]  come January, February, an ever-growing number
[02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:29.240]  of engineers will be working on next year's systems,
[02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:32.040]  not this year's systems, but an awful lot of them
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:34.920]  will be working on still upcoming features
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:36.360]  for this year's systems.
[02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.320]  Yeah, I mean, they start, right after they announce,
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.000]  they start putting, they have that big pile
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:43.260]  on Craig's desk to figure out what comes next.
[02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:46.080]  It's a machine, but it's, and also I think,
[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:47.640]  unless you go to the developer sessions
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:49.200]  or you watch the developer stuff,
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.280]  you don't appreciate how much under-the-cover features
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:53.200]  and changes occur every year as well,
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:54.840]  which you'll see the features or you'll go,
[02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:56.160]  oh, there's not as many features,
[02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:57.880]  then you start looking through the presentations
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:32:01.120]  and there's almost always significant changes
[02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:03.080]  under the covers that take a lot of work
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.160]  to deliver every year.
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.880]  Yeah, I agree, so I, you know, kudos to Apple,
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:09.040]  it's a good year for the software, I think,
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:11.360]  and I think the schedule is settling,
[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.280]  no, I think it's sort of the new normal now
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:14.120]  and I appreciate it.
[02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:17.600]  That brings us to September, that was the third event
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:20.040]  that they held, that was the iPhone introduction event,
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:22.680]  iPhone's 14 and 14 Pro.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:25.480]  Were you okay with just, with the MacBook Air,
[02:32:25.480 --> 02:32:26.320]  because that was dubbed up,
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.160]  but I think we talked about it earlier.
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:30.360]  Oh, yeah. And the MacBook Pro 13-inch
[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:31.480]  that got a new chip.
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:34.760]  The mile, yeah, I guess that counts as WWDC.
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:36.920]  I guess we should, you know, I think it's a great product.
[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:40.600]  I'm about to buy one for a family member.
[02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:41.760]  Same.
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.880]  I don't want to say who, just in case somebody's listening,
[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:45.520]  I don't want to spoil it, but yeah,
[02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:49.040]  I don't have much to say other than that it is the,
[02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:52.040]  it, you know, six months later,
[02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:55.680]  it's exactly the MacBook Air I wanted Apple to build.
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:33:00.680]  It is super thin, it runs cool, has a beautiful screen,
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:03.360]  you know, I don't really have much to add
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.240]  other than, you know, how I reviewed it,
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:07.100]  but I feel like my review stands up,
[02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:08.320]  I think it's a home run,
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:12.200]  and I think it's a form factor that will suit the product
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:15.320]  for a happy number of years going forward.
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:16.420]  I agree, I also think that,
[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:18.040]  I think one of the biggest problems with it, though,
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:20.960]  is the review cycle, because we had a bunch of people
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:23.640]  who decided they wanted to review it as if it was a Mac Pro,
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:25.800]  maybe just because it had Apple Silicon in it,
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:27.360]  and it doesn't have a fan.
[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.760]  Like, this product is not designed to be a MacBook Pro,
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:32.080]  and they would complain that it would hit
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:34.020]  the thermal envelope and ramp down,
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:37.060]  when that is exactly what it was designed and intended to do,
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:39.520]  because people who, like, people like me,
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.820]  who want to, like, make big video projects,
[02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:44.360]  we have MacBook Pros, because we can run them full out
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:46.360]  for 20 minutes, an hour, an hour and a half.
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:48.380]  On a MacBook Air, it's mostly documents work,
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:51.760]  and if the processor can launch up
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:53.360]  and then ramp down when it needs to,
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:54.980]  like, you're opening your app super fast,
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:57.360]  you're, like, opening your web pages super fast,
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.780]  that's not a design flaw that's working as intended,
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.160]  so I was just depressed with a lot of the review cycle
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:03.320]  around the MacBook Air.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:08.320]  Yeah, I, you know, but I feel like anybody
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:11.680]  who read those reviews and was nodding their head
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:14.400]  in agreement, even though I'm not sure that's,
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:18.400]  I'm with you that it wasn't the fairest way
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:21.760]  to measure the MacBook Air, but at least I think
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.460]  the people who'd read them and say,
[02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:26.160]  yeah, I agree with this reviewer.
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:28.240]  Well then, if your conclusion is that you should buy
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.960]  a MacBook Pro instead, like, probably the real MacBook Pros
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:34.800]  in the 14 or 16 inch size, then yeah,
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.100]  that's probably what you knew beforehand.
[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:39.860]  I mean, if you magically thought you were gonna get
[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:43.480]  a 14 inch MacBook Pro at a lower price
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:47.240]  and a thinner form factor, it, you know,
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:49.360]  I don't know what you were thinking.
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:53.400]  Because obviously, the MacBook Pros from last year
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:56.480]  at the end of 2021 were all new form factors,
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:34:57.560]  so if they could have been thinner,
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.400]  they would have been thinner.
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:01.360]  Yes, yeah, you're trading that for the thermal envelope
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.200]  and the fan and all that.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.280]  Right, I guess what we, you know, what I could say
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.360]  in hindsight about the MacBook Air before we move on
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:10.640]  is that now we see what Apple Silicon can do
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:12.720]  to a laptop form factor, right?
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:15.320]  What it can enable, as opposed to putting it
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.040]  into a husk that was designed for Intel.
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.000]  You know, here's how much thinner it can be.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.680]  And you know, it's not crazy thin,
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.600]  it's not like something from Westworld
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:27.680]  that's just a credit card, you know, level of thickness.
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:30.000]  You know, it's, Apple Silicon is very good,
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.360]  but it's not, it's not that good.
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:33.720]  It doesn't break the laws of physics.
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:35.360]  Not yet, but.
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:36.840]  Give them time.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:39.260]  Yeah, all right, September, all new iPhones.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:43.480]  iPhone 14s, they, the new AirPods Pro,
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:46.120]  that would be my second product that I would perhaps
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.120]  hold up as the Apple product of the year.
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.640]  I love the second generation of AirPods Pro
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.080]  as a pedestrian right now.
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  I lost mine or misplaced them recently,
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.140]  and Find My didn't help, and so I went back to my,
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:04.540]  well, no, it was only for an afternoon,
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:05.860]  but I needed to run an errand,
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:10.480]  so I grabbed my original AirPods Pro and went out,
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:12.120]  and as a pedestrian in the city,
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:14.280]  got to a, you know, immediate A-B test,
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.520]  going back to the older noise cancellation.
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:17.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:19.260]  And I was like, I can't hear, I can't hear anything.
[02:36:19.260 --> 02:36:20.100]  I know.
[02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:20.920]  I can't hear anything when a car goes by.
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:21.920]  Yeah, it's hard to go back.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:22.760]  What else?
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:25.160]  Three new Apple Watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra.
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:27.960]  Sorry, do you have like a, in hindsight now,
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:30.600]  we lost the Mini but got the Plus?
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:32.220]  Do I have thoughts on that?
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:33.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:34.160]  Yeah, I'm sad.
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:35.120]  I'm sad.
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.920]  I wish that they would just do all three sizes
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:39.560]  for all three devices.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.640]  You know, I wish that there were,
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:43.320]  I wish they made,
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.680]  yeah, I wish they did six.
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:48.000]  Pro and not Pro at the Mini, regular,
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.580]  and either call it Plus or call it Max size.
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:53.220]  But I understand why they don't,
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:55.100]  and everybody, by all accounts,
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.740]  the Mini really did sell disappointingly.
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:58.580]  Yeah.
[02:36:58.580 --> 02:36:59.560]  So I get it.
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.400]  But boy, when I see somebody who has a Mini,
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:06.520]  I still think, wow, that is an awesome looking iPhone.
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:08.880]  And so it makes me a little sad, but I don't blame them.
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:09.720]  What about you?
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:11.360]  My hot take is that the Mini were like,
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:12.240]  people really loved it,
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:13.800]  who were stuck at computers all day,
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:16.040]  and when they left their computer,
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.440]  and maybe they had three or four computers,
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:18.960]  and when they left it, the last thing they wanted
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.760]  was another full-on computer.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:22.360]  So it was great to just have a phone
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:23.840]  that could still do everything.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:25.220]  But for a lot of people in the world,
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.000]  that's their only or their primary computer,
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.900]  and they just want the biggest screen possible
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:31.000]  to do as many things as they can on.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.520]  So the bigger ones just outsell,
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:34.160]  vastly outsell the smaller ones.
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:37.760]  Yeah, so it is what it is.
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:41.260]  It's pour one out for the iPhone 13 Mini,
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:44.500]  which I really do think will be the last Mini.
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:46.840]  Because I also think that the,
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:48.040]  I think that the rumors,
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.640]  it makes all the sense in the world
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:53.220]  that the next iPhone SE is not going to be based on the Mini,
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:58.220]  it'll be based on the iPhone XR slash iPhone 11 non-Pro,
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:03.840]  with the thicker bezel, the regular LCD screen,
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:06.320]  LED, not OLED, whatever you call it.
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.360]  Retina.
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:08.440]  Liquid retina.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:10.120]  It makes all the sense in the world,
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:14.120]  because it's also a more one-size-fits-all size,
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.880]  where it's not as, it's a little bigger
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:20.400]  than the regular iPhones, but it's not the,
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:22.040]  you're gonna have to pay some sort of premium
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:23.960]  to get a plus-size phone.
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:25.920]  Yeah, there was four years before the other SEs,
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:27.600]  so four years between this
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:30.080]  and the new design makes sense anyway.
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:31.120]  Apple Watch Ultra,
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.560]  I continue to see more of them in the wild.
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:36.720]  I saw, I forget his name, Greg, I forget his surname,
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:39.660]  but he was the coach of the US men's national team.
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:43.720]  He was wearing one throughout the US men's team run
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:44.680]  at the World Cup.
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.560]  And I, you know, I noticed, I've always,
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.800]  it's everybody, you know,
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:53.600]  and at least all the downsides are so obvious.
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:54.580]  What's the downside?
[02:38:54.580 --> 02:38:56.480]  Well, it is more expensive, you know that.
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.760]  It starts at $800, and it's big, and it's thick,
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:03.320]  compared to all the other Apple Watches.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:05.060]  And you know that, so if you go to the store
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:06.680]  and you try it on, and you're like, I'm cool,
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.000]  I actually, you know, many people prefer the bigger size,
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.280]  and other people who may not prefer it,
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:13.540]  but are like, I'm fine with it,
[02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:15.520]  but I want the extra battery life.
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:18.720]  I want this slightly bigger screen, you know.
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:19.720]  People I know, I don't know,
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:22.000]  I know several friends who've purchased one,
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.540]  and I don't know anybody who regrets it,
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:26.080]  because I think you know what you're getting into.
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:27.840]  Georgia Dow, she bought one,
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:30.200]  and she had the smallest Apple Watch,
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:31.380]  and she wore it intermittently,
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:34.120]  but she's been wearing the Apple Watch Ultra all the time.
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:36.160]  And like, she dived, she dived with sharks,
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:38.040]  which still like, flabbergasted me.
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:41.720]  Like, and for her, it's better than renting a dive watch,
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:43.480]  because she can use it for everything else as well.
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:47.360]  So, what I loved was when Justine interviewed Cayenne,
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.640]  and you see the Apple Watch Ultra on both of their wrists,
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.520]  and you're just like, yeah,
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:52.640]  like the size doesn't matter that much anymore.
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:54.640]  Yeah, I thought that even at the hands-on area
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:56.600]  after the introduction, I know you weren't there,
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.180]  but at the, you know how those hands-on areas are often,
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:02.320]  well, they are, they're manned by,
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:05.040]  staffed by people from Apple product marketing,
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.720]  and when I got my hands-on time with the Apple Watch,
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:10.240]  it was with a woman who had very, you know,
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:13.880]  very petite wrists, but she was wearing one today,
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:15.560]  and I was like, but that looks fine.
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:16.460]  And she was like, yeah, you know,
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:18.560]  I've had one on for a while, and it, you know,
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.280]  it takes a little getting used to,
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:21.480]  because it's a little surprising
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:24.200]  if you're going from the smaller Apple Watch
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:25.460]  all the way to this one.
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:28.000]  But yeah, women could, women and, you know,
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:31.200]  the small-wristed among us can get away with it
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.340]  if they want to, and like, I wrote my review.
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:35.540]  Don't overthink it, you know.
[02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:37.160]  It's easy to get self-conscious,
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:38.920]  because you're looking at your wrist,
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.400]  and this thing looks so big on your wrist,
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.000]  nobody else is gonna think that person
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.500]  is wearing a goofily large watch.
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:47.260]  It's a great idea.
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:48.100]  It goes for days and days.
[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:51.080]  Curious where they, I'm curious where they go.
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:53.560]  I would like to see my one wish for next year
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:57.760]  with Ultra 2 would be if they offer it in dark as well.
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:58.760]  Yes. Space gray,
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.920]  space black, call it what you want,
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:03.680]  but make a black one or a dark gray one too
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:06.880]  to go along with the natural titanium color.
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:08.880]  Make the Batman version of the watch, that's all I want.
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:09.960]  What else do we have here?
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.560]  We gotta wrap this up.
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:14.200]  Yes, or it's gonna be next year.
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:15.840]  Yeah, we have, and then I guess what,
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:17.640]  the last hardware announcements of the year
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:19.680]  were the new iPads from October,
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:22.360]  which we sort of talked about already, so, you know,
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:24.160]  and we're just, you know,
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:27.760]  the regular iPad goes to the iPad Air style,
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:30.200]  and, you know, right on time, I don't,
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.860]  it's hard as somebody who's more interested
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:36.280]  at the very high end of the market
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.960]  for all of Apple's devices to really pour myself into it,
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:42.800]  but I'm glad that the people in the market
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:46.240]  for a $400-ish iPad have the option
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:50.720]  to join the, you know, modern interface world.
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:51.840]  Edge to edge world, yeah.
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:53.080]  The edge to edge world.
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:54.800]  Yeah, same, same.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:55.640]  Yeah.
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:57.740]  And the other thing that I forgot that impressed me was,
[02:41:57.740 --> 02:41:58.580]  I don't know when it's coming out,
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:01.200]  but the new CarPlay looked pretty good to me.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.400]  Ah, from WWDC?
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.900]  Yeah, I just saw a picture of it.
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:08.640]  Yeah, that's an interesting question going forward
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:11.800]  because of the way Apple teased that at WWDC,
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:14.040]  where they sort of made it seem,
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:16.000]  coming out of the keynote, we all thought,
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.520]  wow, that's an impressive list of people,
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:21.480]  of car companies who are on board with this already,
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:23.680]  but then it turns out that that was really
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:25.720]  a little bit of sleight of hand where it was,
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:30.260]  these are the car companies making CarPlay-compatible cars,
[02:42:30.260 --> 02:42:32.520]  not necessarily who've already signed on
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:36.240]  to do the new CarPlay, you know, with the dashboard
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.400]  spanning multiple display, take advantage
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.200]  of whatever crazy irregular shapes the car maker
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.600]  might make the displays in their dashboard.
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:49.360]  But, you know, why not support it?
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.640]  I don't know, I think CarPlay's been successful enough
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.000]  and Apple has seemingly, again, I asked at my live show
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.560]  with Jaws and Federighi, I thought,
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:01.280]  it's probably my best joke of the year,
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:04.080]  it was something to the effect of how, you know,
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.000]  it's almost as though you guys are making a car
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.080]  or something like that, I forget what I said.
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:08.280]  Yeah, that was great.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:09.100]  But alluding to the fact-
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:10.680]  You asked them how much the wheels would cost
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.520]  and they asked you how many you wanted.
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.800]  Right, that was pretty good, that was pretty good.
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:16.300]  Yeah, yeah, you know, for a company that is rumored
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:18.680]  to be getting into the car business themselves
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:21.720]  and has been for years, they've clearly done,
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:23.840]  in my opinion, a very good job of getting
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:27.720]  a broad-away array of car makers to support CarPlay
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:30.600]  about as well as you could hope that it supported.
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:32.680]  Yeah, and my understanding is they're gonna work with them
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:35.520]  to customize this a lot, so it's gonna be very, like,
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:37.120]  geared into each individual car
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:39.440]  that they make the deals for.
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:41.080]  Right, other than that, though, you know,
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:42.360]  let's call it a year.
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:43.680]  See you next year, Rene.
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:46.040]  Anyway, congratulations on your big year.
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.520]  Thank you so much, as ever, for your time today
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:52.440]  and for doing this show, which is, you know-
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:53.280]  Anytime.
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:55.380]  Long, but I think we brought it home.
[02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:58.300]  We brought it home with fuel left in the tank.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:01.120]  Yes, we let them wanting just a little bit more.
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:02.280]  Just a little bit more.
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:05.000]  Maybe I'll bet, I wouldn't be surprised,
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.880]  I would not be surprised, conversely,
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:11.600]  if 2022 was a light year for Apple hardware announcements
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:13.440]  because of COVID, maybe, you know,
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:15.400]  I could see 2023 going both ways
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:17.400]  where it still might be affected
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:20.680]  because their product runways are that long,
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:23.120]  or it might be, though, that things that were supposed
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:25.560]  to have already come out start coming out anyway, right?
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:30.260]  So they might be behind where they wanted to have been,
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:32.240]  but will be busy anyway
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:35.000]  because stuff that had been postponed is now ready.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:35.840]  So I wouldn't be surprised-
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:36.660]  Yeah, it's like traffic.
[02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:37.620]  A year from now.
[02:44:37.620 --> 02:44:39.520]  Or an accordion, it compresses and expands.
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:40.960]  It's not like a linear thing.
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:43.380]  Right, I would not be surprised if, come next year,
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:45.500]  we have much more to talk about hardware-wise.
[02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:47.920]  Anyway, I will also, lastly, thank our sponsors.
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:49.160]  We had Squarespace,
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:52.280]  make your next move with a new website, Trade Coffee,
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:55.280]  where you can get incredible coffee delivered fresh,
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:57.760]  including, as a last-minute gift idea,
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:02.220]  Collide is a cross-platform endpoint security solution
[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.340]  for teams that value privacy.
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:08.500]  And last but not least, oh, Memberful, of course,
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:10.640]  where you can monetize your passion with membership.
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:11.960]  Thank you, Renee.
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:33.960]  Thanks, John.
