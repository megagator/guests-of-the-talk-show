[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Are you recording? I am recording. Yeah, we could do like
[00:06.180 --> 00:10.140]  Yes, yeah, one two three, but should we do three
[00:11.100 --> 00:17.340]  Well, we could just clap our head. I already started. Do you want me to stop and do that? No, I thought you were are you are you gonna have the end
[00:17.340 --> 00:19.340]  You're not gonna have this
[00:21.980 --> 00:27.440]  I swear to god you're not gonna do that you wouldn't like that. I was just gonna clap just for your
[00:27.440 --> 00:34.600]  Sick you I don't think here's my thing. I don't think that listeners of the show
[00:34.600 --> 01:04.380]  They shouldn't notice who a damn thing. It should just all the hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot like they won't even know that anything
[01:04.380 --> 01:06.380]  It's changed
[01:07.920 --> 01:16.680]  Quality why would they editing wise I still go I got to dot the eyes and cross the teas on the feed redirection and stuff like that. Yeah, right
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.880]  But that's not my problem or is that my problem? Yeah, that's your problem, too
[01:23.600 --> 01:27.440]  No, I think it seems as though any well-written
[01:28.120 --> 01:30.760]  podcast client if they get a 302
[01:30.760 --> 01:40.560]  H TTP which is like a 301 says redirect go over there, but don't not permanently 302 is permanent and then it should
[01:41.240 --> 01:47.520]  Remember the new URL. So if you were previously subscribed at muleradio.net slash the talk show
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.080]  whatever the feed URL is
[01:50.560 --> 01:58.040]  Your your podcast software will just automatically update to daring fireball.net feeds the talk show or whatever
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.000]  I don't know. I haven't decided on the URL yet, but nobody should notice a damn thing
[02:10.280 --> 02:12.280]  Christ hey back
[02:17.280 --> 02:19.280]  That's everything out splendidly
[02:19.280 --> 02:25.920]  No quality problems are endemic to
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.800]  Podcasting no problems whatsoever. Do you see the rumor today just broke hours before we we started recording that that?
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.640]  Twitter might buy sound cloud. Yeah, that won't mess with anybody
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.940]  No that won't but it's funny Dan from her friend of the show
[02:45.940 --> 02:49.060]  Vocational guest of the the talk show
[02:50.300 --> 02:58.420]  Pointed out the the sort of irony in that is that it's that soundcloud is effectively audio 2.0. Yeah, an audio was
[03:00.220 --> 03:05.980]  Like a hey podcat it was this is it by the time this must be like back in like two thousand hard to remember that I know or
[03:06.380 --> 03:12.540]  2005 but it would have ev Williams and bizstone and all that these guys, you know, they'd left Google after
[03:12.540 --> 03:17.380]  Blogger, you know, it was like Google bought blogger and then when their time was up
[03:17.380 --> 03:20.420]  They all got the hell out of Google and they made audio and it was going to be like like
[03:23.380 --> 03:27.340]  Blogger for podcasting and it just they just didn't seem it seemed you know
[03:27.340 --> 03:28.100]  It's good idea
[03:28.100 --> 03:34.260]  I mean they were on to something in terms of like back in 2004 2005 thinking podcasting was going to be big
[03:35.740 --> 03:39.740]  Clearly they're at it, you know the base the fundamental idea there's pretty good
[03:39.740 --> 03:44.060]  And ahead of its time, but they didn't never got quite got it to work
[03:44.060 --> 03:50.580]  And then it was like one of their guys a little you know guy named Jack is over there and they were like anybody else have any ideas and
[03:50.580 --> 03:52.580]  Jack Dorsey is like I got an idea
[03:53.660 --> 03:56.260]  And it turned into Twitter Twitter. Yeah
[03:58.220 --> 04:03.540]  But I audio the audio really didn't it was a separate company though, right? Well, it well
[04:03.540 --> 04:06.940]  it started Twitter started as an audio product and
[04:06.940 --> 04:10.980]  And it you know, I'm not quite sure what the legal
[04:13.020 --> 04:21.060]  You know, so at some point you know lawyers came in and and it went from Twitter being and an audio product to Twitter being
[04:21.060 --> 04:25.020]  It's standalone, you know corporation. Yeah, it was spun off
[04:25.660 --> 04:30.500]  But but Twitter date started life as a product of the audio corporation
[04:32.420 --> 04:34.420]  I've got an audio
[04:34.420 --> 04:37.260]  Nothing happened to that to audio. Yeah
[04:38.940 --> 04:41.100]  I think they changed the name to the obvious
[04:41.620 --> 04:43.620]  Corporation I think it might
[04:44.220 --> 04:50.060]  Yeah, which I think is still the parent company of medium, you know, that's the new thing that oh
[04:50.580 --> 04:55.620]  Real okay, okay. That's that's they just when he started that he just started under that umbrella
[04:55.900 --> 04:58.020]  Yeah, I think I you know and again
[04:58.020 --> 05:05.300]  Is there really a difference if they just design or know maybe they just dissolved audio and started a new company called obvious
[05:05.620 --> 05:10.460]  Word, I think they changed the name though, you know, just to feel like save on paper with something
[05:10.460 --> 05:11.660]  I don't know
[05:11.660 --> 05:16.300]  Like it might have been easier to just change the name of audio to the obvious corporation
[05:16.700 --> 05:18.700]  right
[05:18.700 --> 05:24.100]  Are you are you playing I'm using sand plot? I guess so. I mean it's I don't want to get
[05:24.100 --> 05:28.220]  Well, it's funny because now that I have to
[05:30.700 --> 05:36.820]  Worry about every single detail of hosting the podcast and and there are it's like, you know, I don't know how much of the details
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.820]  You're taking care of with the
[05:40.460 --> 05:42.460]  What's the parenting show?
[05:42.460 --> 05:46.140]  Get back in and I'm gonna turn this car around. Yes turning this car on
[05:47.660 --> 05:50.060]  I was gonna call it don't make me go back there
[05:50.060 --> 05:53.460]  I'll split that was also in the running
[05:55.820 --> 05:59.940]  We had we did it but we had a long list of I think things that dad say yeah
[06:01.020 --> 06:03.020]  That was probably that was probably under someplace
[06:04.140 --> 06:12.380]  But there are there's all sorts of details they have to worry about and and a fundamental one is where do you store the audio files?
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.700]  Yeah
[06:14.700 --> 06:17.980]  It would cost according to my calculations
[06:17.980 --> 06:19.420]  a
[06:19.420 --> 06:24.260]  Couple of thousand dollars a month for me to host the audio on Amazon s3
[06:25.580 --> 06:28.060]  Could be off by a little, but I'm probably not off by a lot
[06:30.140 --> 06:32.140]  Which is you know
[06:32.140 --> 06:37.620]  It's start talking about hundreds of dollars and I might just squander it thousands of dollars. You've got my attention
[06:38.260 --> 06:42.980]  And soundcloud is free this I mean I don't want to get to inside baseball here, but to me
[06:42.980 --> 06:44.980]  It's a sort of an interesting. It's the
[06:44.980 --> 06:49.260]  perils of venture backed cloud services
[06:49.780 --> 06:54.700]  So soundcloud is free for everything and and it's it started life
[06:54.700 --> 06:59.780]  I guess is sort of a music hosting service where musicians could have put songs up and have people playing
[06:59.780 --> 07:03.220]  But they don't you know they let you put anything up there including podcasts and
[07:04.180 --> 07:08.580]  And you can put your podcast there and they don't insert their own ads
[07:09.020 --> 07:12.260]  They have a player that you can embed like if you've got you know
[07:12.260 --> 07:17.460]  If anybody's ever looked at the talk show pages on mule radio, they use the soundcloud
[07:17.980 --> 07:24.700]  Embedable player that's what that's what we use and it but that doesn't really have ads it has soundcloud branding
[07:25.060 --> 07:31.860]  But you don't have to use their audio player, you know like Dave whiskus's unprofessional show
[07:33.620 --> 07:37.360]  Him and Jamie newberry now or the host of that I forget who used to be the host
[07:38.180 --> 07:41.140]  Hey, well, what's this I always forget that guy's name
[07:41.140 --> 07:44.100]  What's that's it? Lex right?
[07:45.420 --> 07:48.220]  Who is on my my parenting podcast he is
[07:50.380 --> 07:52.380]  He never speaks up
[07:53.140 --> 07:58.260]  All over here is you and John are you on the Casey treatment isn't this called the Casey treatment?
[07:58.780 --> 08:04.220]  They should do it so they should do a show and they should be called like those guys the other guys
[08:04.220 --> 08:12.460]  Yeah, right the other guys. Oh my god. That'd be great. I should pretend to be each other
[08:13.940 --> 08:15.940]  Just to confuse things
[08:16.660 --> 08:23.700]  But yeah, I got none professional he hosts the their audio with soundcloud, but he uses a different, you know at HTML5 audio player
[08:24.220 --> 08:32.980]  And it all seems too good to be true and because behind the scene soundcloud hosts your audio on Amazon s3 and so you know
[08:32.980 --> 08:39.060]  It's it's hundreds or if for a popular enough show thousands of dollars worth of s3
[08:39.620 --> 08:42.740]  Bandwidth that soundcloud is just covering
[08:43.700 --> 08:48.820]  Based on the like 60 million dollars. They've raised in you know venture capital. Yeah
[08:49.540 --> 08:51.540]  So it's a perfect fit for Twitter
[08:53.780 --> 09:00.740]  Right and no idea how to monetize this right and so like with like my friends and as I've been talking and
[09:00.740 --> 09:08.340]  And planning and plotting and detailing, you know, everything I have to do to move the the talk show to be part of during fireball and
[09:08.980 --> 09:14.180]  I see I hear that and I think well, that's too good to be true and too good to be true is to me
[09:14.180 --> 09:16.740]  It makes me very uncomfortable. I'd rather pay a
[09:17.380 --> 09:20.580]  reasonable amount of money for something that I feel is sustainable
[09:20.740 --> 09:25.900]  Then do it and I say this to some people and some people hear it and they you know, and they think I have a good point
[09:25.900 --> 09:29.300]  That is a little worrisome and then other people are like just take the free hosting dummy
[09:29.300 --> 09:34.740]  And you know worry about what you do when it goes away when it goes away wait for the bomb
[09:35.140 --> 09:37.140]  You have an established podcast
[09:37.700 --> 09:42.260]  So in your situation, it's a little easier. You know with established
[09:43.940 --> 09:48.020]  Sponsors and so it's a little easier to actually go out and show something out
[09:48.020 --> 09:53.220]  But like right you know when we started up we didn't have any we didn't have any advertisers to begin with and so right it would have been
[09:53.300 --> 09:54.900]  We've been a lot harder
[09:54.900 --> 10:01.340]  Right, it's it's not that I have a lot of confidence that I was going to go someplace and there's other options besides Amazon s3
[10:01.540 --> 10:05.260]  There's you know all sorts of things like you know one could do to host a podcast
[10:05.260 --> 10:09.220]  But there you know because SoundCloud offers a good quality
[10:09.900 --> 10:11.900]  You know because it's backed by s3
[10:12.900 --> 10:18.180]  I'm they don't tell you that but it just if you poke around and see where your stuff's coming from it seems like it is
[10:18.180 --> 10:24.340]  um good quality it works around the world which is often a problem like if you were just to
[10:24.900 --> 10:28.340]  Do like the the obvious thing and just get like a you know
[10:28.340 --> 10:34.420]  Linux server and start just put your audio files there and let people download it like in people around the world might have
[10:34.660 --> 10:38.740]  trouble getting it whereas something that's meant to be a content delivery system
[10:39.380 --> 10:41.380]  Like s3 works better
[10:41.380 --> 10:43.380]  And then you don't have to pay
[10:43.380 --> 10:47.700]  It's right and again like you said it seems like a perfect fit for Twitter
[10:49.780 --> 10:56.180]  You guys have no idea guys have exorbitant costs and no idea how to make money for it. We're gonna we're gonna spend
[10:57.220 --> 10:59.700]  You shouldn't be part of litter dollars on you guys
[11:03.300 --> 11:05.300]  You should go and work with us
[11:05.620 --> 11:07.620]  All sorts of acquisitions
[11:07.620 --> 11:14.340]  Mark or this is there's another one a Marco uses something else what's lips lip sit lip sin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[11:14.980 --> 11:18.500]  I think about that one. Yeah, there are there are a little bit less
[11:20.580 --> 11:26.100]  Nebula in terms of the money like they have like some kind of tearing and paid accounts and and something I don't know
[11:29.140 --> 11:31.140]  Amy
[11:31.140 --> 11:35.140]  What's your name and Paul confesses have a show then they use lips and two
[11:35.140 --> 11:37.140]  I
[11:37.140 --> 11:42.020]  I'm so bad the names. Yeah, yeah, I understand. That's why I like to have you on the show John
[11:43.620 --> 11:45.620]  You just have to remember what your name is
[11:46.900 --> 11:48.900]  He's got the same name that I've got
[11:50.900 --> 11:52.900]  Never bother you that Armstrong doesn't have an age
[11:53.860 --> 12:00.820]  Yeah, he must be a Jonathan, right whenever I see a J.O.N. I just that's what that is. I assume that you're a Jonathan, right?
[12:00.820 --> 12:10.900]  But we're not right. I mean, you're I know no. No, I see J.O.N. And I think you're really a Jonathan and you're just pretending to be a John
[12:11.460 --> 12:18.700]  And then when other people will say to me if they say hey is your real name Jonathan group is your full name Jonathan group
[12:18.700 --> 12:20.940]  Then I'm offended cuz I'm like no, I have an age
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.660]  Were you where you named after somebody?
[12:23.660 --> 12:28.220]  I'm sort of long story short
[12:30.380 --> 12:32.380]  I was a first child and
[12:33.020 --> 12:35.020]  my mom
[12:35.180 --> 12:41.740]  This is before any kind of ultrasound type technology so when my mom was pregnant with me in
[12:42.780 --> 12:44.780]  1972
[12:45.580 --> 12:47.980]  All they knew was that she was pregnant
[12:48.540 --> 12:51.740]  Sound had not been invented nope sounded and neither or nor had color
[12:51.740 --> 12:53.740]  Right, right
[12:53.740 --> 12:57.740]  But my mom was a hundred percent convinced that she was having a girl
[12:58.540 --> 13:04.860]  She'd had no children before but she just felt like she was having a girl and it she even has she still has it like a
[13:06.220 --> 13:09.900]  Little like back pocket sized book of baby names
[13:10.540 --> 13:15.180]  Like the sort of little almost like a pamphlet book with thousands of names, but it's you know
[13:15.580 --> 13:19.580]  It's like you could fit and I could it's like the size of a field notes 45 names
[13:19.580 --> 13:23.020]  That you know used to buy books like that in a supermarket
[13:23.340 --> 13:28.940]  Yeah, and she has it and and like the girl pages are all like
[13:29.580 --> 13:36.900]  Worn you know that there's also and there's annotated dozens and dozens of names circled and then different colors for like second
[13:36.900 --> 13:40.940]  and there's like two boys names. It was like Jason and I
[13:41.820 --> 13:43.820]  Forget the other one
[13:44.060 --> 13:46.060]  That didn't like it though
[13:46.060 --> 13:49.740]  But there were like two boys names that were like vaguely underlined and that was it
[13:49.740 --> 13:54.060]  That was the only thought she'd put into it and then I came out and they said it's a boy
[13:54.700 --> 13:57.180]  And she goes no, it's not and my dad
[13:58.220 --> 14:00.220]  put it back and and
[14:01.420 --> 14:06.220]  And she was upset because she didn't know she just was so sure it was a girl that had no names picked out
[14:06.220 --> 14:11.660]  And my dad was not in a room because this was 1973 and men still done no
[14:11.660 --> 14:14.940]  Wasn't in a he was in a smokefield room with a bunch of cigars. Yeah
[14:16.780 --> 14:21.660]  Yeah, probably like a six pack or something sure and then they came in and they said
[14:23.180 --> 14:26.220]  You know good news wife had a baby. It's a healthy boy
[14:26.940 --> 14:32.540]  And my dad I guess he joined my mom in a and she said well, what are we gonna call him and he just got his name is John
[14:32.540 --> 14:41.260]  And that was it there was like no discussion of my mom had just been like hours and hours over the proceeding like eight months
[14:41.740 --> 14:46.700]  Picking out girls names and they'd never discussed it and my dad just goes his name is John
[14:46.780 --> 14:52.620]  Now it ends up that both both of my grandparents her dad and my dad's dad were both named John
[14:53.180 --> 14:56.620]  Okay, and so you know everybody felt honored
[14:57.260 --> 14:59.260]  Right
[14:59.260 --> 15:05.100]  What about you your name after anybody? Yeah, my grandfather my mom's dad he passed away like
[15:05.980 --> 15:10.780]  Six months before I was born, so I was named after him. Hmm tragic. Yeah
[15:12.540 --> 15:15.260]  It's a good name smoke kids. Don't smoke. It's a good name
[15:17.580 --> 15:19.580]  Gets me through the day. Yeah
[15:21.100 --> 15:25.500]  Lots of other acquisitions in the news. So in near
[15:25.500 --> 15:34.700]  Near acquisitions. Yeah tortured continuing tortured acquisitions. Yes. Well the beats one which I thought would have been old news by the time
[15:34.700 --> 15:39.260]  We were recording this is still not still a limbo. It's still actually not news
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.740]  Like that we're getting close to two weeks now, right? Since it'll be like the end of this week
[15:45.740 --> 15:47.740]  But two weeks Friday, right?
[15:48.540 --> 15:50.540]  And a lot of people have been writing to me
[15:50.540 --> 15:55.980]  You know a daring fireball emailing saying like hey, maybe this whole thing. It's just nonsense and you know
[15:56.380 --> 16:00.620]  Apple not denying it is just their usual, you know, we don't comment one way or the other
[16:01.580 --> 16:07.500]  Because if they and there might be you know, who knows I don't I actually don't know but you know
[16:07.580 --> 16:12.860]  The idea would be well, why wouldn't Apple just publicly deny it if it weren't true the idea then would be
[16:13.660 --> 16:19.180]  Um that they'd be you know giving to know anything right because then they'd be giving it away if there's another
[16:19.180 --> 16:21.180]  Subsequent one
[16:21.420 --> 16:25.580]  That was real but was still pending and then they didn't comment on that one
[16:26.300 --> 16:27.420]  then
[16:27.420 --> 16:32.060]  It would be a sign that if it's not true Apple will deny it, but if it is true
[16:32.380 --> 16:35.100]  They'll be quite where so therefore if they want to
[16:36.620 --> 16:38.060]  maintain
[16:38.060 --> 16:43.180]  You know he people had in up in the air until they have actually make the announcement themselves
[16:43.180 --> 16:45.580]  They have to not comment on everything whether it's true or false
[16:45.580 --> 16:50.220]  So there's some logic there, but I do think though that if it weren't the case
[16:50.220 --> 16:53.740]  They I don't think they mood address it officially with an official statement
[16:53.740 --> 16:59.580]  But I think behind the scenes they get word out and we haven't I haven't seen any sign of that
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.580]  There's not a single
[17:01.580 --> 17:03.580]  Report from anybody saying
[17:03.980 --> 17:08.780]  You know unnamed sources familiar with the situation say that Apple is not buying beats
[17:08.780 --> 17:14.700]  Everything has said you know indicates that they that they still intend to and
[17:15.500 --> 17:17.340]  Peter Kafka of
[17:17.340 --> 17:20.140]  Recode that's like the new all things D
[17:20.860 --> 17:23.580]  Um he said like midweek last week
[17:24.300 --> 17:26.780]  That it was taking longer than expected
[17:26.780 --> 17:30.460]  But that this is the week sometime this week. It'll be announced. I guess
[17:30.460 --> 17:38.780]  I can't I it seems like that video probably didn't help no, I would guess that that video
[17:38.780 --> 17:42.380]  I think did not help that probably wasn't a bright idea
[17:43.340 --> 17:45.340]  You would think so
[17:45.980 --> 17:47.980]  It just
[17:47.980 --> 17:54.940]  My guess is it's not the video that was the problem. It's the fact that the video
[17:54.940 --> 17:59.580]  Yeah, that's probably not the right the major the major problem right it was probably jumping the gun
[17:59.580 --> 18:02.220]  Yeah, and I would guess that
[18:02.780 --> 18:07.900]  Dr. Dre did not expect it to be posted to Facebook, you know, I got he you know
[18:07.900 --> 18:10.140]  Mean he's he's very very smart man
[18:11.100 --> 18:13.100]  And he's clearly been
[18:13.740 --> 18:19.260]  If it's true, he's clearly been in he knows enough that Apple doesn't want anything announced
[18:19.260 --> 18:23.660]  I think that the you know it was the fact that it was his friend that wasn't that he posted at the Facebook
[18:23.660 --> 18:25.660]  It was his friend that posted at the Facebook
[18:25.660 --> 18:28.860]  I bet that was a good conversation
[18:30.060 --> 18:34.540]  Because it was only up for a few hours right and it was taken down early in the morning
[18:36.380 --> 18:41.500]  And it also seemed like the sort of situation where maybe he wouldn't have been getting up early in the morning
[18:43.740 --> 18:45.740]  Right
[18:46.300 --> 18:51.500]  That would probably be my guess as well. Yeah, there might have been a little sleeping in done after that video was made
[18:51.500 --> 18:56.140]  No, and I pass no judgment there. Nobody loves to sleep in more than I do
[18:58.780 --> 19:00.780]  You sure can't swing a
[19:01.020 --> 19:04.540]  Para beat headphones around without hitting somebody with an opinion about it though. Yeah
[19:05.020 --> 19:10.380]  Yeah, I think the funny thing is I think that's it's to me the interesting thing about it isn't the actual
[19:10.380 --> 19:14.060]  It's no longer the actual acquisition of it comes to pass. It's more
[19:15.100 --> 19:19.500]  That the way that we've had like this two-week period where it was just a
[19:19.500 --> 19:25.980]  Unconfirmed rumor with no explanation from Apple or beats as to why
[19:26.540 --> 19:29.820]  Apple would want to do this. It's become like this sort of
[19:30.860 --> 19:34.940]  Blank canvas where everybody can project whatever they think about Apple onto it
[19:37.100 --> 19:38.300]  Right
[19:38.300 --> 19:40.700]  Good or bad. Yeah, yeah, I guess
[19:41.820 --> 19:43.500]  I think I think it yeah, everything I mean
[19:43.500 --> 19:45.500]  I think everything that Apple does has that has that
[19:45.500 --> 19:50.140]  Element to it. Yeah, and I feel but I feel like this more so than anything else because we
[19:50.860 --> 19:55.500]  It did seem to come out of left field like nobody was really predicting it
[19:56.460 --> 20:03.500]  It did seem confusing at first to a lot of us to me at least and I think it's still I think it's still confusing a little bit
[20:03.580 --> 20:07.660]  Anyway, because it doesn't seem like the hardware is that great. It doesn't seem like
[20:08.460 --> 20:11.100]  this you know, I mean like they have a streaming service already and
[20:11.100 --> 20:19.260]  And from where what everybody says it doesn't seem like the licenses for the music go along with the sale right
[20:19.740 --> 20:21.740]  but then there's
[20:22.460 --> 20:24.460]  I have mine
[20:24.620 --> 20:29.340]  But three billion seems like a lot for an aqua higher right exactly right
[20:29.340 --> 20:35.020]  I don't you know, maybe altogether though. Maybe yeah, I mean we've all together. It seems like something a little bit here a little bit there
[20:35.980 --> 20:39.900]  So it's not you know on the surface. It's not completely clear exactly
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.900]  What the value is
[20:42.700 --> 20:50.460]  Yeah, I totally agree, but I don't know though that it you know, I'm I'm willing to say as somebody who is you know
[20:50.460 --> 20:51.740]  I think
[20:51.740 --> 20:53.740]  widely known as a
[20:53.740 --> 20:55.740]  Kean Apple observer
[20:55.740 --> 21:01.980]  I'm willing to say I just don't know and I'm just wait and I'll just wait, you know
[21:01.980 --> 21:07.100]  I don't have there's no way that I could go off on any kind of strongly opinionated
[21:07.100 --> 21:09.100]  um
[21:09.660 --> 21:16.060]  You know column or or rant here on the show one way or the other that this is stupid or it's genius
[21:16.460 --> 21:20.940]  Either way. I don't know because I don't know enough yet. I don't know why more people can't just say I don't know
[21:21.420 --> 21:23.420]  right
[21:23.420 --> 21:28.860]  They think that's a sign of weakness. I guess I don't know but I've seen people's you know saying that this is
[21:29.500 --> 21:33.020]  the clear sign this is you know incontrovertible proof that
[21:34.220 --> 21:36.220]  Tim Cook is a moron
[21:36.220 --> 21:39.740]  You know that he's running the country into the you know company into the ground
[21:40.460 --> 21:44.700]  And I've seen other people say it's genius, you know, and this you know
[21:45.100 --> 21:51.180]  Keeps Apple on top of the music industry for another two decades, and it's like really I don't see how either of those extremes
[21:51.900 --> 21:53.900]  Is evident in the least
[21:53.900 --> 21:58.380]  Yeah, John did you redo John the week guess is no, I did not
[21:59.340 --> 22:03.580]  He's got a yeah, he's got a piece up today as Monday notice about is about that and his yeah
[22:03.580 --> 22:07.340]  I mean, and he kind of splits it fairly
[22:08.140 --> 22:13.340]  Well basically just saying that he doesn't he doesn't understand it at this point right
[22:14.940 --> 22:16.540]  Yeah, I think that's the to me
[22:16.540 --> 22:21.420]  That's the only thinking man's take is and it doesn't make it less intriguing if anything
[22:21.420 --> 22:24.140]  It makes it more intriguing because it's like wow now we you know
[22:24.140 --> 22:27.820]  There's something interesting going on here. I can't wait to find out more about it
[22:28.380 --> 22:31.180]  There's gotta be you just feel like there's gotta be something more
[22:31.180 --> 22:35.420]  You know, like I don't think I really really
[22:36.620 --> 22:40.140]  Really do not think that the the answer is
[22:41.980 --> 22:48.460]  Apple has just given up and decided to just be lazy and just throw billions around really nearly without really thinking about it
[22:49.020 --> 22:51.020]  That after going decades
[22:51.180 --> 22:54.380]  only making relatively small I mean
[22:54.380 --> 23:01.100]  I think it's the case that they haven't made a billion they've never made a billion dollar acquisition
[23:04.540 --> 23:09.180]  And then all of a sudden now after never having done so now they're just going to spend money willy nilly
[23:09.740 --> 23:11.740]  I mean that doesn't matter
[23:11.740 --> 23:17.980]  It just doesn't make sense to me. No, like without a very very concrete idea of how it's gonna help Apple
[23:19.020 --> 23:21.020]  I just don't see it though
[23:21.020 --> 23:26.460]  It's interesting that when they acquired next to me next was only like 400 million or something like that. Yeah
[23:27.580 --> 23:33.020]  400 and some yeah, and there's some inflation and adjustment that you have to do right right
[23:33.180 --> 23:35.980]  But there's also I mean I think there's just a apart from
[23:36.620 --> 23:40.700]  The value of the dollar there's there's an acquisition and inflation
[23:41.580 --> 23:46.140]  Yeah, that's gone on since then yeah, but these acquisitions that have happened have just driven up
[23:46.140 --> 23:48.780]  It's like every time somebody wants to get acquired they're like wells
[23:48.780 --> 23:50.780]  You know the
[23:52.140 --> 23:54.140]  Facebook bought Instagram for
[23:55.660 --> 24:00.540]  Well, look at it this way the Apple the Apple the Apple next acquisition was
[24:01.340 --> 24:04.220]  I forget when it was officially completed
[24:04.380 --> 24:06.780]  I think it was like at least a handshake
[24:07.740 --> 24:09.740]  Around Christmas 1996
[24:10.140 --> 24:12.620]  But but made official in January
[24:13.020 --> 24:15.980]  97 so whether you want to call it 96 or 97
[24:15.980 --> 24:19.180]  and probably 97 is a little bit better because it you know
[24:19.980 --> 24:24.460]  You know Christmas week or New Year's week 96 is effectively in 97 anyway
[24:25.420 --> 24:30.620]  But even so that the dot com bubble was still in the early days
[24:30.860 --> 24:34.700]  You know, it's it had gotten started, but it was still early days and so
[24:35.660 --> 24:40.700]  I think at that point acquisitions were still largely done on
[24:41.740 --> 24:42.860]  traditional
[24:42.860 --> 24:51.500]  Metrics of revenue revenue and profit like the idea that you would value an acquisition on anything
[24:52.700 --> 24:54.700]  Well, just
[24:54.700 --> 25:02.380]  It's had in a lot of cases, but in others maybe not so you know like a good example might be Facebook buying Instagram
[25:03.180 --> 25:07.980]  Where Instagram hadn't tried to make a nickel right? They'd never sold the app
[25:07.980 --> 25:14.460]  They'd never done was clearly a worth a lot right because they had growth and they had you know
[25:14.460 --> 25:19.660]  All of these images they had even at good technology like one thing that ought to me often goes
[25:20.220 --> 25:24.860]  Inside about Instagram because it's when things work. We just don't notice it. We take it for granted
[25:25.420 --> 25:26.860]  but
[25:26.860 --> 25:34.860]  Twitter which was all just text you know had so many problems with scaling with the fail well etc
[25:34.860 --> 25:42.380]  Instagram was doing something, you know, where I'm guessing the average Instagram post is at least
[25:43.740 --> 25:49.100]  Well, I could be it's gotta be at least a thousand times bigger than a tweet though because it's an image not a
[25:50.780 --> 25:57.020]  Not just 140 characters, right? I don't know I might but that could be 10,000 times more
[25:57.020 --> 26:01.100]  I don't even know I don't even know how big an Instagram image, but it's gotta be at least a thousand times more
[26:01.100 --> 26:07.420]  And never really had scaling problems, right and the previous
[26:08.620 --> 26:10.300]  Darling of
[26:10.300 --> 26:17.660]  Social photo sharing flicker now that we have to go way back in the day for the early days of flicker before Yahoo bought them
[26:18.780 --> 26:24.140]  Also had you know terrible scaling problems and it was far smaller than Instagram was
[26:24.140 --> 26:30.380]  They did a great job. So there's some value there, but billions or what was it one billion that Facebook bought them for I
[26:31.340 --> 26:34.780]  Think so for a company that never even tried to make a nickel
[26:35.820 --> 26:40.860]  It's crazy well not crazy, but it's it's it would certainly be crazy if they had a lot of users
[26:42.380 --> 26:47.340]  Which is a pretty important rhetoric for that kind of thing and the potential to make money is there
[26:48.460 --> 26:50.620]  Yeah
[26:50.620 --> 26:54.380]  Right, I think the biggest thing if you're gonna compare something like
[26:55.020 --> 26:57.980]  Apple buying beats for three billion today
[26:58.700 --> 27:01.820]  To Apple's next acquisition in 97
[27:02.380 --> 27:05.980]  Isn't about the the inflationary difference between
[27:06.620 --> 27:08.780]  400 and some million then and three billion now
[27:09.020 --> 27:15.180]  It's really more how much is the the cost compared to how much the Apple had on hand at the time
[27:15.180 --> 27:21.340]  Whereas now Apple has what like 160 billion in cash much of it off-sea overseas
[27:23.420 --> 27:30.380]  But even so even if you even if they decided to pay the entire price in cash using overseas cash and pay
[27:30.460 --> 27:34.300]  You know 30 or 40 percent income tax on the thing
[27:34.860 --> 27:39.660]  It's it's a drop in the bucket right they could spend five billion on beats and it's only
[27:39.660 --> 27:45.180]  135th of their entire cash on hand, you know, right?
[27:45.180 --> 27:50.140]  It's a you know whereas the 400 and some million acquisition of next in
[27:50.540 --> 27:52.540]  1997 was
[27:53.180 --> 27:55.980]  People say this all the time that it's a bet the company move
[27:56.140 --> 28:00.780]  That that is one case where it's not the least bit hyperbolic where it was enough
[28:00.780 --> 28:02.940]  You know Apple was near bankruptcy. They didn't have
[28:03.820 --> 28:06.300]  They couldn't afford to lose to not have a workout
[28:06.300 --> 28:09.420]  Right if you were it was basically so
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.180]  Yeah, so
[28:11.180 --> 28:16.140]  Microsoft's investment was Microsoft 150 million right 150 million. Yeah, so it was
[28:17.100 --> 28:21.980]  Three times bigger third a third. Yeah, I assume it's a Microsoft basically pay for a third of that
[28:23.260 --> 28:29.260]  I've said this before Microsoft's people often look back at that and say that Microsoft helped save Apple by giving them
[28:29.660 --> 28:34.300]  150 million the 150 million they gave Apple didn't really make much of a difference compared
[28:34.300 --> 28:38.220]  You know in terms of keeping the company afloat like right they need its office. Yeah
[28:38.220 --> 28:45.340]  They still needed billions of revenue per quarter just to stay in the black so 150 million investment from Microsoft
[28:45.340 --> 28:50.700]  I mean it was enough at the time that it certainly didn't hurt, but it didn't really make a big difference
[28:50.700 --> 28:56.540]  I mean they needed billions in revenue and to keep cost down to stay in the black quarter to quarter it was the
[28:57.420 --> 29:02.780]  Like you said, yeah the commitment to keep doing office and the political value of the
[29:02.780 --> 29:04.780]  150 million dollar investment
[29:05.100 --> 29:10.220]  Yeah, the fact that it's Apple's revenue last quarter was 45.6 billion
[29:13.660 --> 29:16.140]  So you know considering that they take in that
[29:16.780 --> 29:19.180]  About that and that's not it wasn't even a record quarter
[29:22.220 --> 29:24.220]  Three million does not three billion does not seem like
[29:25.580 --> 29:30.300]  Very much right. I think that the the concern and I have this concern. I do
[29:30.300 --> 29:33.180]  I mean, I you know, I want to see how it turns out. I mean, but as a
[29:34.060 --> 29:40.700]  As a company watcher. I'm certainly concerned about it where it's not the money. It's to me the
[29:42.220 --> 29:45.100]  The potential that it could signify a lack of focus
[29:46.060 --> 29:47.900]  You know that focus has always been
[29:50.140 --> 29:55.420]  The key to Apple's success that they have all of this talent in the company and
[29:55.420 --> 30:03.740]  And so many good executives and the whole operation is working on such a relatively few number of products
[30:05.420 --> 30:08.220]  Now Tim Cook has said I used the analogy several times
[30:08.700 --> 30:15.420]  But that like you know that that he could put all of the company's products on one table in an Apple store
[30:15.900 --> 30:23.580]  The entire lineup of hardware that Apple sells could be arranged neatly on one table and that that sort of focus is what and
[30:23.580 --> 30:27.660]  Let's the company do such good work on those products
[30:28.780 --> 30:30.780]  Yeah, and I guess that that
[30:31.100 --> 30:34.060]  Kind of colors how you think this deal is
[30:35.100 --> 30:39.820]  The value of this deal depending on whether you think that they're going to sort of subsume that brand into their own
[30:40.620 --> 30:44.060]  Or keep it separate. Yeah, totally. I mean,
[30:44.540 --> 30:49.420]  Monteiro and I talked about this last week. I just don't know I to me that's the one of the single biggest questions
[30:50.300 --> 30:52.300]  About this potential acquisition is
[30:52.300 --> 30:59.420]  And it's fascinating to me because on the one hand, I can't see Apple having
[31:00.540 --> 31:02.540]  owning a
[31:02.540 --> 31:10.620]  Subbrand and on the other hand, I can't see spending three billion dollars for beats and not keeping the brand because to me
[31:11.340 --> 31:14.300]  It seems to me like most of the value in beats is in the brand
[31:15.260 --> 31:17.260]  Yeah, I would guess so
[31:17.260 --> 31:19.260]  Again, again, we're just right
[31:19.260 --> 31:21.260]  I
[31:21.260 --> 31:27.060]  Have heard from some people. I mean clearly among audio files, you know like your Marco armaments
[31:30.300 --> 31:36.940]  People who really know what they have seemingly have fully operational ears and really can tell the difference between different headphones
[31:37.580 --> 31:41.660]  Beats is is like a non entity and and almost treated with disdain
[31:42.300 --> 31:46.700]  But I've seen other people say well, so audio files will keep buying their audio file headphones
[31:46.700 --> 31:49.420]  You know from Sennheiser and whoever else
[31:50.860 --> 31:57.420]  But normal people love the way beats headphones sound and that it's not about like
[31:58.700 --> 32:03.980]  Fidelity and reproducing music, you know in some sort of way that you measure fidelity, but
[32:05.100 --> 32:07.900]  Effectively making it sound as though you have a nightclub in your head
[32:09.180 --> 32:16.620]  Now and that they do a really good job of that. I don't know though that that means that it would be hard for a competitor to do
[32:16.620 --> 32:21.580]  The same thing though that they you know that they have technology that is it that they have technology that's hard to
[32:22.300 --> 32:29.180]  Reproduce or you know, I don't think that's true like that. No, it doesn't seem like it's in particularly since their stuff was made by monster before
[32:30.140 --> 32:34.280]  Right, I mean, they've only been making their own stuff for a little while six
[32:34.780 --> 32:37.820]  Can six months or something. Yeah, maybe a little longer than that
[32:38.460 --> 32:42.780]  I've also seen other people and this is on Twitter and you know, it's always you know
[32:42.780 --> 32:50.380]  It's been the knock against Apple for did as long as Apple is existed. I mean probably from like 1980 onwards
[32:51.900 --> 32:58.180]  People who are clearly not a fan of Apple products in general saying it's a perfect acquisition for Apple overpriced technology
[32:58.780 --> 33:00.780]  Sold based on marketing alone
[33:02.220 --> 33:06.140]  So it's a you know, I don't think it's a problem for Apple that from among some people
[33:06.380 --> 33:11.780]  The idea that Apple buys beats reinforces that notion of the company because I feel like those people
[33:11.780 --> 33:15.420]  There's nothing Apple could ever do in a million years to turn them around. Right
[33:15.780 --> 33:21.860]  You know, and if your goal is to get a hundred percent of all consumers to view your brand
[33:22.180 --> 33:26.020]  Favorably you're doomed you're never you're gonna end up you know
[33:26.820 --> 33:34.260]  You're gonna end up failing. Yeah, there's no brand in any market that that works like that. So what other or what other acquisitions? Well, let's take a break
[33:34.820 --> 33:36.820]  Okay, and
[33:36.820 --> 33:45.540]  Let me tell you about our first sponsor our good friends all three sponsors today long-time friends of the show glad to have mumboard with the
[33:46.780 --> 33:50.420]  Transition to the the new daring fireball version of the talk show
[33:51.580 --> 33:57.060]  Our first is our good friends at igloo. That's the internet. You'll actually like
[33:59.820 --> 34:02.220]  igloo and they want me to tell you a little bit about
[34:02.220 --> 34:09.580]  They're comparison to SharePoint now SharePoint's an internet product from a little company in my
[34:10.260 --> 34:14.820]  Washington state of Washington up by you Microsoft. That's correct. Just up the road
[34:15.780 --> 34:18.100]  If you go to the URL, I'm gonna tell you in a minute
[34:19.220 --> 34:23.340]  Which is igloo software dot com slash the talk show
[34:24.020 --> 34:30.020]  You will go to a special page. They've set up just for listeners of the show where they show the results of
[34:30.020 --> 34:32.020]  a
[34:32.020 --> 34:36.900]  White paper that they commissioned from a company called Ostrom in research. They said here you guys got there
[34:36.900 --> 34:43.860]  We're paying you but got there and do an honest version where you compare our product to SharePoint and and we're gonna share the information with people
[34:44.580 --> 34:48.420]  And they came out ahead and just about every way you could imagine
[34:49.220 --> 34:53.300]  SharePoint is too expensive. You can save a ton of money by going with igloo
[34:54.020 --> 34:57.380]  SharePoint requires too many resources. You have to host it yourself
[34:57.380 --> 35:01.500]  You have to pay for these Windows servers igloo. It's fully hosted. You don't have to worry about it
[35:02.540 --> 35:05.180]  People actually this is the big one people actually use it
[35:05.380 --> 35:08.480]  What they found is that companies that use SharePoint based
[35:08.780 --> 35:15.300]  Internets what the employees actually do is spend all their time going around it and using email and avoiding it
[35:15.460 --> 35:19.540]  Whereas companies that use igloo people actually will use it and they like it
[35:20.420 --> 35:25.820]  And I'm laughing because I used to work someplace to use SharePoint and and that is exactly what
[35:25.820 --> 35:31.020]  What we found right you install it and then people find ways to get a route we get away from it
[35:31.820 --> 35:35.660]  SharePoint doesn't play well with mobile. That's a huge thing going forward
[35:36.300 --> 35:39.340]  You know igloo everything they do it has responsive layouts
[35:39.340 --> 35:43.180]  So it's all works great from your phone whether you're on Android whether you're on iOS
[35:44.780 --> 35:51.260]  So they have a thing you can download just go to igloo software dot com slash the talk show they have an evaluation kit
[35:51.260 --> 35:53.260]  You can download
[35:53.260 --> 35:58.220]  They also have some new templates. They've set up. These are pretty recent. These came out like last month
[35:59.020 --> 36:06.420]  But templates you can use in igloo to set up igloo in different ways depending on what you need like if you need a customer community site
[36:07.260 --> 36:14.860]  Or a corporate intranet just for your team to share two very different use cases whether you're you know setting up something for a community of your users
[36:15.340 --> 36:17.820]  People who are outside the company or something internal only
[36:17.820 --> 36:21.460]  They have an app-based social network
[36:23.740 --> 36:28.220]  Couple of new templates all of them you can start using for free
[36:28.860 --> 36:35.220]  With up to 10 people just to try it out and that's just fantastic because then you you just set it up free
[36:35.740 --> 36:37.820]  Start using and free get 10 people on board
[36:37.820 --> 36:43.340]  You don't have to pay anything and make sure that it works just the way you want that it actually is all these things
[36:43.340 --> 36:50.500]  I've just been telling you were true only then do you need to sign up when you add more than 10 people and after that the price is really really competitive
[36:51.820 --> 36:56.780]  So my thanks to them and again just go to igloo software dot com slash the talk show
[36:59.500 --> 37:02.140]  What we're talking about acquisitions so what else positions?
[37:03.900 --> 37:05.900]  There's oh
[37:06.940 --> 37:09.220]  This is good. This is why I thought about having you on the show
[37:09.220 --> 37:16.460]  So it's again rumored not completed as we record, but YouTube is supposedly by yeah Twitch Twitch
[37:17.460 --> 37:23.940]  For a billion dollars and so there's two interesting things about that one twitch is is effectively
[37:24.500 --> 37:29.540]  I saw it. I just posted a thing before I did we started recording that it's it's like the ESPN of video games
[37:29.860 --> 37:36.380]  That they stream right they treat video games the way ESPN treats sports and you go to twitch and you use twitch and you can watch
[37:36.380 --> 37:39.060]  You know top players play video games
[37:39.980 --> 37:46.860]  And you and I have talked about this cuz our right sons or 10 years old are really into watching videos of people playing video games
[37:48.620 --> 37:52.700]  And you know I didn't come up with this last time we talked about it, but you know
[37:52.700 --> 37:54.700]  I've already watched this season
[37:55.340 --> 38:01.780]  Probably the Yankees have played I think 42 games so far. I've probably watched about 30 of them
[38:01.780 --> 38:03.300]  so
[38:03.300 --> 38:09.340]  I'm probably up close to a hundred hours of baseball that I've watched so far this year and yet
[38:09.340 --> 38:12.380]  I'm the one who was thinking just just like a month ago
[38:12.380 --> 38:18.740]  How crazy it is that my son watches people playing game video of people playing games rather than playing them himself?
[38:18.740 --> 38:20.740]  Whereas I haven't played baseball
[38:21.740 --> 38:27.780]  15 years and watch hundreds of hours over the year and it just hit me like a ton of bricks like duds the same thing
[38:27.780 --> 38:31.580]  You know, I'm in the baseball so I love watching my favorite baseball team play
[38:31.580 --> 38:36.100]  He's in the video games and so he loves watching people play video games
[38:36.940 --> 38:42.340]  And I would rather watch people play video games because I have a better chance than with my local sports team
[38:42.340 --> 38:44.740]  I have a better chance seeing somebody actually win
[38:49.500 --> 38:51.500]  So
[38:53.020 --> 38:58.180]  It's so I think that may mean if you're if you're you to Google YouTube that makes a lot of sense
[38:58.180 --> 39:03.940]  I also think it's interesting that it's being dealt with as a YouTube acquisition not a Google
[39:03.940 --> 39:08.540]  I thought that was interesting too. Yeah, and I didn't even notice this but like the head of YouTube
[39:08.540 --> 39:11.660]  It her title is CEO like there YouTube
[39:11.660 --> 39:16.500]  I didn't know that I just thought because they were trying to get the same unified sign in everywhere
[39:16.500 --> 39:21.340]  I didn't realize that YouTube is you know is independent as it seems to be it's interesting
[39:22.540 --> 39:25.740]  But it totally makes sense to be you know for it to you know
[39:25.740 --> 39:31.260]  It does make sense that it's YouTube in particular not Google in general that might be making this acquisition
[39:31.500 --> 39:32.300]  Yeah
[39:32.300 --> 39:36.580]  somebody and I apologize because I don't remember it was a retweet of someone who I don't follow but
[39:37.300 --> 39:45.140]  Said that a while ago Vimeo had noticed that a bunch that people were posting a lot of sort of let's play videos and
[39:46.100 --> 39:48.100]  and responded by banning them
[39:48.100 --> 39:57.740]  Which I mean I guess you know if that's what you want for your platform and yeah want that kind of thing on your
[39:57.740 --> 40:02.020]  I mean they're they're they're a little more artsy. I guess yeah, and they've you know
[40:02.260 --> 40:07.300]  They've yeah, they've always sort of differentiated themselves from YouTube or YouTube has sort of been like
[40:08.020 --> 40:12.980]  Anything that you can legally post as video you can post to YouTube
[40:13.620 --> 40:15.220]  where at you know, I mean I you know
[40:15.220 --> 40:17.220]  And
[40:17.380 --> 40:23.740]  Copyright stuff in particular and I'm sure that there's some kind of content based stuff that that would get rejected from YouTube
[40:23.900 --> 40:26.580]  But if it's legal you can post it and they don't care what it is
[40:27.220 --> 40:33.060]  Right, I mean you can just you know, it's yeah, I'm sure they actually are often and they basically usually it seems like they usually
[40:33.060 --> 40:35.540]  Wait for someone asked to have it taken down right?
[40:35.820 --> 40:40.980]  Whereas Vimeo is always sort of yeah exactly they sort of want a sort of artistic style
[40:40.980 --> 40:46.400]  I don't know and they also have restrictions about commercials type stuff, you know, where you can't
[40:46.900 --> 40:50.940]  So I didn't think about that the licensing aspect of it
[40:51.220 --> 40:55.260]  Which maybe it may be that is more of what it is rather than sort of the artsy
[40:55.980 --> 41:02.460]  Aspect of it. Yeah, I thought it was more like but we don't we don't want let's play videos on our
[41:03.740 --> 41:05.740]  First sight
[41:05.740 --> 41:11.820]  I did see somebody tweeted that one of the things people who are fans of Twitch are concerned about with the YouTube acquisition
[41:11.820 --> 41:15.260]  Is that a lot of these videos get posted with music playing in the background
[41:16.260 --> 41:21.660]  You know and YouTube has gotten very very good at flagging such things identifying
[41:22.300 --> 41:28.860]  Copyright music, but to me that's sort of a you know, and you know, I'm not a big fan of Google
[41:28.860 --> 41:34.780]  I think it's fair to say, but I have to say that if you're putting copyright music in your videos and uploading them to a
[41:34.780 --> 41:36.780]  commercial website
[41:37.380 --> 41:43.660]  And it gets flag that's on you. Yeah, there's sort of you know the world's tiniest violin playing the sad song here for you
[41:43.660 --> 41:48.380]  It's like, you know, I understand that it's it and if you know, it's one of those things like
[41:49.780 --> 41:54.660]  Comexology going to Amazon where you know, it is making it worse for you as a user
[41:54.660 --> 41:58.940]  But you know come on you know copyright stuff is still copy you know, there's
[41:58.940 --> 42:04.180]  You can't using music for free is still you have to admit it's a gray area, right?
[42:05.260 --> 42:10.060]  Like you had to you know, you had to think eventually that's that bubble was gonna burst one way or the other
[42:10.300 --> 42:14.300]  Yeah, and I do I think we're on the cusp of this sort of
[42:15.300 --> 42:22.140]  Video people people spent you know note and observe observing noting and then monetizing the fact that
[42:23.580 --> 42:28.220]  Millions of people are watching hundreds and hundreds of hours of people play video games
[42:28.220 --> 42:32.820]  This that's gonna become a thing. It's it's gonna. It's quickly. It's not gonna take long before it
[42:32.820 --> 42:35.380]  It's like me who think wow these crazy kids today
[42:35.780 --> 42:38.980]  You know no longer see it as as odd or unusual
[42:40.060 --> 42:44.660]  Yeah, I think it maybe you mentioned this before, but I feel like that's this this is kind of my first
[42:45.900 --> 42:47.740]  moment of
[42:47.740 --> 42:53.140]  Having something like that come up. I mean and and from kids so young. I mean kids from you know our kids are 10
[42:53.980 --> 42:57.380]  And seeing what they do and kind of and at the beginning going
[42:57.380 --> 43:02.540]  Oh, you know, you know, that's so low brow, but then realizing well, maybe not. Maybe it's
[43:02.980 --> 43:06.980]  Maybe I need to give it another chance. Yeah, and I'm sure it's just like any I mean
[43:06.980 --> 43:10.100]  I feel like I'm almost proud of myself for being as
[43:10.820 --> 43:13.540]  uncurmudgingly as to recognize that this is
[43:14.020 --> 43:19.220]  Normal that this there's not that I shouldn't be seen that I was wrong that I shouldn't be seeing this as weird. Yeah
[43:19.620 --> 43:21.620]  I'm kind of proud of myself
[43:22.180 --> 43:24.180]  And and wasn't until
[43:24.180 --> 43:28.340]  He started watching that stuff that I even realized that this was such a huge industry
[43:28.700 --> 43:29.860]  Yeah
[43:29.860 --> 43:35.780]  Well, you wrote that I wrote that article right the guys are doing Minecraft stuff and I mean they're making ridiculous amounts of money
[43:35.780 --> 43:43.700]  Right and good for them, right? Yeah, no, it's great. Right. I mean because it all comes down to the bottom line is attention
[43:43.700 --> 43:51.100]  You know, we this is not a new observation. It's obvious, but you know, that's the one thing that we have collectively in the aggregate
[43:51.100 --> 43:55.220]  That's that's a limited resource every person only has 24 hours in the day
[43:55.220 --> 44:01.500]  And we need to spend a certain number of hours of that sleeping and eating and working or going to school or something so
[44:03.340 --> 44:05.740]  You know, if you're capturing in the aggregate
[44:06.380 --> 44:14.940]  Millions of hours of attention. There's tremendous value there. Yeah, the stampy long-nose that guy that are the main guy that I wrote about that article
[44:16.380 --> 44:19.140]  Recently tweeted that he's you know, there's a picture of
[44:19.140 --> 44:24.940]  Jack black, you know, he visit was visiting with Jack black and the two of them are going to be working on something together
[44:25.220 --> 44:28.020]  That's awesome. Yeah, that's so great
[44:29.180 --> 44:31.180]  Which is a really which is a good fit?
[44:31.980 --> 44:39.180]  For starters, but also just I mean the fact that this guy who was working in a pub two years ago and this now
[44:40.580 --> 44:47.580]  Gigantic mobile of YouTube micro videos so awesome, but that it's all just you know of a piece that you're doing this
[44:47.580 --> 44:51.380]  You know, you're doing this thing that people watch for this reason
[44:51.380 --> 44:54.100]  I do these things that people watch for another reason we should do something together
[44:54.820 --> 44:57.020]  right
[44:57.020 --> 44:59.020]  What else acquisition news?
[45:00.020 --> 45:04.300]  AT&T oh, yeah is buying direct TV for
[45:04.700 --> 45:09.420]  $45 billion you can just feel the increase in competition, can't you?
[45:11.460 --> 45:16.300]  I was just talking to somebody yesterday. We got together with friends yesterday out of town friends
[45:16.300 --> 45:23.500]  And and we were talking about that that that's the thing that really great about Comcast
[45:24.100 --> 45:26.020]  Time Warner
[45:26.020 --> 45:32.620]  merger, which is really Comcast buying time Warner, which is out for almost the same amount of money like forty six billion dollars
[45:33.740 --> 45:41.300]  It would be one thing of Comcast argument was okay. Don't worry. This is still going to be okay for consumers. Here's why
[45:41.300 --> 45:46.860]  That's in and there's some kind of argument they could make there and maybe it makes some kind of sense
[45:46.860 --> 45:51.100]  But the fact that they're actually saying that it will increase competition
[45:51.620 --> 45:57.180]  It would increase competition for us to consume our largest competitor
[45:57.820 --> 45:59.820]  Makes no sense
[45:59.820 --> 46:04.300]  right like if the Yankees and Red Sox merged
[46:04.980 --> 46:09.060]  You could say well, this would be good for baseball for this reason or the other
[46:09.060 --> 46:15.820]  But you can't say it would increase competition because it's two arch arrivals with you know big budgets
[46:16.020 --> 46:18.020]  It they can't
[46:18.420 --> 46:21.900]  Direct TV and AT&T merging can not increase competition
[46:23.700 --> 46:25.700]  It's yeah, it's the classic
[46:26.700 --> 46:31.940]  lobbyist talk. Yeah, I also saw that the direct TV in particular was part of
[46:31.940 --> 46:39.580]  A part of complicated. It's I think it's driven, you know, it could be the sort of thing where maybe AT&T wouldn't have done this if they didn't
[46:39.660 --> 46:46.340]  Have the nagging feeling that this Comcast time Warner thing is going to go through and that they kind of need to you know
[46:46.340 --> 46:48.340]  They need to get bigger in the same way
[46:49.700 --> 46:52.980]  But that Comcast part of Comcast argument that it's that
[46:53.540 --> 46:58.740]  This is not anti-competitive or bad for consumers in a competitive way is that the average
[46:58.740 --> 47:01.860]  U.S. citizen has like three options or three three
[47:02.660 --> 47:06.740]  At least three options is an alternative to Comcast in time Warner
[47:07.060 --> 47:11.980]  But that that's it's not about cable service here home or any kind of wired
[47:13.620 --> 47:19.780]  Thing it's direct TV, right, you know that their counting is competition something of an entirely different sort
[47:20.500 --> 47:22.500]  Just the whole thing
[47:22.500 --> 47:29.540]  I've mentioned this before. I'm just glad that here in Tacoma. We have a city provided broad band
[47:30.060 --> 47:34.740]  You know very few cities have done that forget who asked. I just saw somebody was
[47:35.780 --> 47:41.540]  Was it San Diego? I forget there's somewhere in Southern California where they have municipal municipal Wi-Fi and
[47:42.820 --> 47:47.660]  That it works. It's it's really good and you're like I think if it's not San Diego
[47:47.660 --> 47:49.400]  It's somewhere else in Southern California
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.060]  But that you know you're downtown and you can just walk around and get on the Wi-Fi and you have you know
[47:54.700 --> 47:57.100]  Superior to you know like LTE
[47:57.740 --> 48:03.660]  You know wireless internet everywhere. Yeah, but those pockets are very few in front between yeah
[48:04.860 --> 48:10.980]  So what do you guys have you guys have wired broadband? Yep, and yeah, and who do you pay? Who do you write?
[48:10.980 --> 48:15.540]  We were we were one of those like I've been the late 90s like one of those cities that was
[48:15.540 --> 48:20.660]  Buying for the title of America's most wired city or something
[48:21.660 --> 48:28.500]  Hmm, you know, there's the few but how do you do it? Do you do it? So the city runs the network and
[48:29.340 --> 48:33.500]  They have contracted with a few small local private
[48:34.500 --> 48:40.900]  Companies to provide the service and come out and do the installation and stuff like that. There's a good service. So just it's fine
[48:40.900 --> 48:50.020]  Huh, yeah, I mean, it's certainly no worse than Comcast. That should be the same. I feel good that I'm not sending Comcast my money
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.260]  That should be there slogan
[48:53.260 --> 48:55.820]  Yeah, certainly no worse than Comcast
[48:57.060 --> 48:59.100]  You know, it's still I mean, I you know, I experience
[49:00.100 --> 49:05.740]  Ups and downs. I don't have any idea if I experience more ups and downs than your average Comcast user. Yeah
[49:06.700 --> 49:09.300]  But I don't it don't get a lot of them
[49:09.300 --> 49:12.500]  And I I pay for like the cheapest
[49:13.460 --> 49:16.540]  Level so shocker. Yeah
[49:19.220 --> 49:21.220]  You need that before you ask
[49:21.580 --> 49:26.940]  Let me take a break here and thank our second sponsor a good friends at back plays
[49:27.580 --> 49:29.580]  back blaze is
[49:30.060 --> 49:31.620]  unlimited
[49:31.620 --> 49:36.180]  Unthrottle uncomplicated backup for your Mac available anywhere
[49:36.180 --> 49:41.540]  You pay five dollars a month per Mac and you get
[49:42.660 --> 49:44.660]  unlimited backup
[49:44.660 --> 49:46.660]  Sounds too good to be true, but it's not
[49:47.380 --> 49:52.900]  Makes a lot of sense. Does it take a long time for your initial backload upload of your entire
[49:53.460 --> 49:58.700]  Four gigabytes or whatever you have or four terabytes. However big it is to upload
[49:58.700 --> 50:00.380]  Yeah, it does actually
[50:00.380 --> 50:08.220]  But you can just do it during your free trial period and then once your whole Mac is backed up over the cloud to back blazes
[50:09.980 --> 50:16.180]  Servers everything else is just incremental after that and they have iOS apps
[50:17.260 --> 50:22.060]  For your iPhone for iPad that you can access your data from anywhere at any time
[50:22.260 --> 50:27.860]  So if you're on your iPhone and there's a file that you know is on your Mac and your whole Mac is backed up to back
[50:27.860 --> 50:31.980]  Blaze you can just go into back blazes on your iPhone go to where that file is
[50:32.580 --> 50:34.580]  on your hard drive and
[50:34.820 --> 50:37.900]  Download it right there to your iPhone from anywhere anytime
[50:38.620 --> 50:44.060]  And it's all for just five dollars a month. No upgrades. There's no. Oh for well
[50:44.060 --> 50:47.620]  There is a five dollar five dollar a month tier, but it's not really the one you want
[50:47.620 --> 50:51.940]  You're gonna want to upgrade to a bigger thing because you only get so much. No, it's nothing like that
[50:51.940 --> 51:02.340]  It's just five dollars a month for everybody per Mac great service. I always say it makes you sleep better knowing you have an off-site backup
[51:02.980 --> 51:05.300]  I've been using it. I forget how long I've been using it
[51:06.100 --> 51:08.860]  And it just runs in the background on your Mac
[51:09.500 --> 51:16.860]  Nothing to worry about just a great service. I think it's probably a great thing not just for all of you out there listening to the show
[51:17.020 --> 51:19.540]  But it's also a great thing that you could
[51:19.540 --> 51:22.980]  Set up for your parents or anybody like less technical
[51:24.020 --> 51:26.020]  Family and friends members who have Max
[51:27.300 --> 51:30.980]  So that you know that everything they have is getting backed up off-site
[51:31.940 --> 51:36.980]  Just in case something bad happens in the house or wherever their Mac is great great great great service
[51:37.860 --> 51:42.780]  If you haven't tried it, I just I can't imagine what you're waiting for and I don't even know
[51:42.780 --> 51:46.860]  I can't imagine why anybody would try it and then not sign up for it because it's just so great
[51:46.860 --> 51:53.900]  Uh, where do you go to sign up and find out more easy go to their website www.backblaze
[51:54.620 --> 51:55.820] .com
[51:55.820 --> 51:56.860]  slash
[51:56.860 --> 51:58.540]  Daring fireball
[51:58.540 --> 52:01.740]  backblaze.com slash Daring fireball
[52:02.780 --> 52:04.780]  My thanks to them
[52:06.140 --> 52:08.140]  I'm going there right now
[52:10.540 --> 52:15.980]  Yes, it's you but you should I know I currently don't have off-site backup. Well, then you're not is dumb
[52:15.980 --> 52:22.620]  Yeah, really dumb you and you should start it start it right now while we're recording the show over Skype because I'm sure that won't cause any
[52:24.700 --> 52:26.700]  No
[52:26.700 --> 52:31.360]  Mike wait until we're done. My thanks to backblaze for ruining this recording of the talk
[52:36.540 --> 52:43.100]  I tell you it does put perspective on it where if you want, you know, Apple the company with 160 billion in the bank is buying the company
[52:43.100 --> 52:48.860]  for three billion dollars and and it was mega mega news for you know, a week and a half
[52:49.580 --> 52:55.340]  It'll if assuming it comes to fruition this week. I'm sure it'll pop pop back up to the top of the tech news
[52:56.940 --> 53:02.780]  Was that one 15th the size of 18 T's purchase of direct TV. Yeah
[53:04.780 --> 53:07.580]  Do you think that they would wait until WWDC? I
[53:07.580 --> 53:13.500]  I've asked I thought of that I'd you know, they're close enough now because what we're as we record today
[53:13.500 --> 53:19.660]  We're two weeks to the day. We're recording on Monday the 19th. So we're two weeks to the day. So I don't know why not, you know
[53:20.860 --> 53:25.180]  It you know would and especially if they have some sort of
[53:25.820 --> 53:30.460]  consumer-based story to tell about why they're doing it and what they have planned together
[53:30.460 --> 53:40.300]  Why not? You know why not just get all the paperwork ready to go and don't put the signatures down until Sunday June first and then
[53:40.380 --> 53:43.860]  You know Monday June 2nd have something something on the keynote
[53:45.260 --> 53:48.860]  It's close enough there. I wouldn't get them. Then you got instant news
[53:50.620 --> 53:56.700]  Right not that anybody's probably not gonna write about it anyway, but um well and they get their own
[53:56.700 --> 54:01.820]  They get to they get to spin it their way tell their story
[54:01.820 --> 54:08.620]  You tell their side of the story and explain themselves first in a in a forum that's more
[54:11.100 --> 54:13.100]  You know a richer
[54:13.100 --> 54:19.420]  Medium than just a press release right a press release. You just can write what you want to say whereas during a
[54:19.420 --> 54:27.180]  WWDC keynote you can tell it and you can you know use use your voices and you know slides and
[54:27.900 --> 54:32.780]  Bring Dr. Dre up non stage if you want. I don't know. I don't know but it you know it's
[54:33.820 --> 54:37.820]  You know it's the way that you know there's something about watching people talk
[54:38.220 --> 54:41.180]  That's different and better than just reading about it
[54:41.820 --> 54:47.900]  Right the iPhone announcement in 2007 would not have been the iPhone announcement that it just come out in a press release with a picture
[54:47.900 --> 54:56.220]  It's the fact that it was on on stage with the crowd. Right. Stan Sigmund hadn't been there. Right. Exactly. What would we have laughed at?
[55:01.980 --> 55:05.020]  Wonder if anybody else remembers them as fondly as we did god that was
[55:07.100 --> 55:09.100]  It was it was it was just so
[55:09.420 --> 55:11.740]  Because that that keynote was so amazing
[55:11.740 --> 55:18.220]  And then we had to sit there for five minutes and listen to Stan Sigmund. Do you know what's the end Stan?
[55:18.220 --> 55:21.900]  You know who Stan Sigmund was he Stan Sigmund is it's Sigmund or Sigmund?
[55:22.460 --> 55:26.460]  Sigmund. Stan Sigmund was to the iPhone keynote
[55:27.260 --> 55:29.500]  What Christian Latener was to the dream team?
[55:31.740 --> 55:35.260]  Do you remember that the dream team the original the first time a US
[55:35.260 --> 55:42.380]  percent professional basketball players to the Olympics and it was Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson
[55:43.020 --> 55:45.020]  Charles Bart I mean it's just
[55:45.020 --> 55:50.540]  Yeah, those three the three at the top are arguably the I think well, you know LeBron's probably up there now
[55:50.540 --> 55:56.540]  Maybe I don't know but you know at the time they were all three were considered arguably the single greatest player of all time
[55:57.500 --> 55:59.500]  all on the same team
[55:59.500 --> 56:06.460]  All you know almost all not just all stars but Hall of Famer's down the line and then they had they had room for one
[56:06.540 --> 56:08.940]  College player and it could have been either Shaq
[56:09.660 --> 56:16.940]  Who wound up having a fantastic pro career, you know Hall of Fame career or Christian Latener from Duke and they picked Christian Latener
[56:19.900 --> 56:21.900]  That was Stan Sigmund
[56:21.900 --> 56:27.340]  The greatest announcement in the history of consumer electronic
[56:30.700 --> 56:32.700]  And then at one point
[56:32.700 --> 56:42.620]  And then it just like stalls, right? We're in the midst of outright near pandemonium and delirium in the in the in the hall
[56:44.140 --> 56:46.140]  All of a sudden there was
[56:46.780 --> 56:48.780]  narcolepsy
[56:48.780 --> 56:51.420]  People had to pass smelling salts out
[56:53.580 --> 56:55.580]  Yeah, when when
[56:56.380 --> 57:01.980]  When Jerry Yang is up there, yeah, who's cheering is up there, and he's not like the least carer's
[57:05.100 --> 57:07.100]  Right
[57:07.100 --> 57:18.300]  You're right, but Jerry Yang back up
[57:20.860 --> 57:22.860]  Breaking them
[57:22.860 --> 57:26.380]  It has come to our attention that like a dummy
[57:27.340 --> 57:28.540]  I
[57:28.540 --> 57:34.780]  Forgot to mention something that I wanted to during the recording with John Moltz and that is this
[57:34.780 --> 57:40.380]  For those of you who will be in San Francisco during the week of WWDC
[57:41.340 --> 57:45.420]  I'm gonna have another live audience episode of the talk show
[57:45.980 --> 57:48.300]  I've done this last two years this week the third year
[57:48.860 --> 57:53.340]  It's been a lot of fun and the show should be even better than before
[57:53.900 --> 57:56.780]  It's going to be on Tuesday. That's June 3rd
[57:57.660 --> 58:01.500]  6 to 9 p.m. At mezzanine in San Francisco. We've already got the venue
[58:01.500 --> 58:05.580]  I don't have any ticket information yet. Don't have the URL
[58:06.460 --> 58:08.460]  But I will
[58:08.460 --> 58:12.700]  What I'm going to do is rather than announce it on daring fireball
[58:12.700 --> 58:19.180]  I will announce it here on the show in the next episode not this episode not not the one you're listening to right now
[58:19.820 --> 58:21.820]  Next episode episode 82
[58:22.060 --> 58:23.660]  I will
[58:23.660 --> 58:28.940]  Have instructions URL or something like that where you go to buy your tickets for the show
[58:28.940 --> 58:33.100]  So the first crack at tickets. We should have about 500 available
[58:34.060 --> 58:36.060]  The first crack will go to
[58:36.540 --> 58:38.060]  The first people who listen to the show
[58:38.060 --> 58:41.100]  So if you really want to get a ticket you want to be sure to get one pay attention
[58:41.580 --> 58:47.580]  Keep your eyes peeled for the next episode of the talk show episode 82 give it a listen and in that show
[58:48.060 --> 58:50.060]  You'll find out how to get a ticket
[58:50.060 --> 59:00.060]  Thanks. Hope to see you there and now back to the talk show
[59:01.340 --> 59:06.620]  So so WWDC all right two weeks two weeks
[59:07.100 --> 59:10.460]  Now maybe you want to hold off on you want to hold off on speculation for your next show
[59:11.100 --> 59:13.580]  Maybe, but you know you could ask me questions
[59:15.100 --> 59:17.100]  I
[59:17.100 --> 59:25.420]  Big iPhone, I don't think so. Oh, wait wait wait wait. I got a better. I got a better question split screen iPad. Yeah
[59:30.060 --> 59:33.660]  I believe it. I mean, I don't think it's ridiculous
[59:34.140 --> 59:36.140]  And you know, I trust
[59:37.180 --> 59:44.380]  Mark german who reported it enough that I don't think that he you know, I think his source probably you know was reasonably
[59:44.380 --> 59:48.140]  Either in Apple or reasonably could be expected to
[59:50.060 --> 59:57.100]  To know of such a thing, but I don't know it the devil would be in the details in terms of how it's actually how you actually get into
[59:57.420 --> 59:59.420]  And out of this such a mode
[1:00:00.540 --> 1:00:05.980]  Yeah, because I think that's been I mean in Microsoft always tells that you can use two apps at the same time
[1:00:06.700 --> 1:00:11.020]  But you wouldn't really want to right my guess is if it's true
[1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:15.660]  It's something that you manage within the the multitasking
[1:00:16.540 --> 1:00:17.660]  Switcher in other words
[1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:20.300]  the thing you get when you double tap the home button and
[1:00:20.860 --> 1:00:26.140]  That you zoom out a little bit to like a card type view now in Iowa seven you do
[1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:36.540]  And it might even help explain why they switched to that card type view where you actually see what looks like windows of your apps as you pan left and right
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:40.700]  And that maybe you could take two of them and push them together
[1:00:41.420 --> 1:00:46.060]  Yeah, and then you know, but I don't know though it all seems you know
[1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:49.580]  You start thinking about this if you actually try to think it through and you know
[1:00:50.460 --> 1:00:55.020]  Get it detailed down enough that you could actually hand over to someone and say okay build this
[1:00:55.740 --> 1:01:01.020]  You start seeing how complicated it is because it almost certainly would require
[1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:07.500]  apps to support it explicitly because the size of the app on screen would be it would be a new size
[1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:12.460]  Yeah, it would be a new window size right right because it's you know, it's something that would work with
[1:01:13.260 --> 1:01:16.300]  If they announced it at WWDC by definition
[1:01:16.300 --> 1:01:22.300]  It would be part of an announcement of iOS 8 not a part of a new iPad hardware, so it would have to work on existing iPads
[1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:29.740]  And so you could just take the half the size of the I've I've pad screen and that's the size that the app would be running in
[1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:31.740]  It's you know 10 20
[1:01:32.300 --> 1:01:34.300]  2048
[1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:36.300]  So it would be like 1024 by I
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:45.660]  Don't know whatever it would be I can't do math math right, but it would still be new dimensions in a new size. Yeah
[1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:50.700]  And it would
[1:01:52.860 --> 1:01:57.580]  So you couldn't just push together any two apps you'd only be able to push together two apps that support it
[1:01:57.580 --> 1:02:00.540]  Well, then how do you show the user which ones you can push together?
[1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.500]  I don't know. Yeah
[1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:07.260]  And he also he ends the other thing was he and sort of insinuated that
[1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:11.820]  It might have implications for well, I guess he said this but
[1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:15.340]  For data sharing between different apps
[1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:20.700]  On that point I think he was I think he was guessing guessing
[1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:25.420]  Yeah, I don't think so because I don't think yeah, it didn't seem like that was you know what came from his source
[1:02:25.420 --> 1:02:30.060]  It seemed like that was his reference. Yeah, I don't think it would require the
[1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:33.420]  XPC as he said yeah
[1:02:35.420 --> 1:02:38.380]  Certainly possible, but again, I think it would have to be you know
[1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:42.140]  You have to figure out after you see the details of exactly how you get into and out of the mode
[1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:44.460]  And I think it has to be the sort of thing
[1:02:44.940 --> 1:02:48.540]  Where I think the most important thing would be that you can't get into it accidentally
[1:02:48.540 --> 1:02:54.860]  Because I think that then all of a sudden you're and it's starting to turn into something like the Mac where people are easily confused
[1:02:55.420 --> 1:02:57.420]  And that's so big a part of right?
[1:02:57.900 --> 1:03:02.300]  Why is a pro it would be gonna be great as a pro feature something that you turn on explicitly
[1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:08.860]  Right and you just can't underestimate you don't you don't want somebody I mean like my mother or father
[1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:13.180]  Right and I that everything's always and I don't play that card lately
[1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:15.180]  You know that because I know that some people
[1:03:15.180 --> 1:03:18.860]  get all incensed about the plane that oh you know the
[1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:27.740]  Non-techy tech savvy grandparents card, but it's true. No, it's absolutely true. I mean my my parents both have iPads now
[1:03:28.700 --> 1:03:36.780]  And I've in years. I've gotten like one call about like an iPad problem, and it was really came down to
[1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:42.540]  Like a billing thing with the cellular wireless which is you know
[1:03:42.540 --> 1:03:46.620]  Sort of a complicated aspect of it but in terms of just using it
[1:03:46.620 --> 1:03:51.820]  It's never been a problem whereas I think I think you and I talked about you didn't you get a call once when
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.620]  Somebody was in full screen mode
[1:03:55.500 --> 1:04:02.780]  Yeah, oh, yeah, absolutely it couldn't get out right exactly. No, that was exactly true where my my parents had
[1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:08.460]  Got a new iMac and upgraded jumped a couple versions of Mac OS
[1:04:08.460 --> 1:04:12.940]  and never had full screen mode before got into it and
[1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:16.380]  It was a confusing phone call because I was in there like how do you quit?
[1:04:16.380 --> 1:04:20.540]  We want to quit mail and I was like just go up to the menu and they're like there is no menu
[1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:22.940]  I might there's always a menu and then I thought wait
[1:04:23.740 --> 1:04:25.180]  Not when you're in full screen
[1:04:25.180 --> 1:04:27.500]  Although I guess if you run the mouse up there
[1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.500]  There is a menu, but because they couldn't see it in the first place
[1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:31.980]  They never even thought to run the mouse up to see if there was a menu
[1:04:31.980 --> 1:04:39.500]  Yeah full screen can getting into full screen mode accidentally required a phone call and I feel like whatever the iPad does
[1:04:39.740 --> 1:04:44.540]  For two apps on the screen at the same time. Can not be something that it's gonna get me a phone call
[1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:49.340]  Yeah, if I get a phone call about it, then I then Apple has somebody didn't do their job
[1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.420]  And to me that's more important than number two
[1:04:53.740 --> 1:04:55.580]  Which would be making it
[1:04:55.580 --> 1:05:01.660]  Convenient enough that power users who know what they're doing and who really want to do it can get into it
[1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:04.220]  Easy enough that it's that they end up using
[1:05:07.100 --> 1:05:09.580]  I don't know it's like there's a lot of people out there who
[1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:17.660]  I don't want to call them iPad doubters, but you know people who've just generally down on the iPad as like a
[1:05:18.220 --> 1:05:22.300]  Long-term replacement for the Mac and productivity device
[1:05:24.940 --> 1:05:28.300]  Who who want more power user type features
[1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:35.340]  In iOS especially on the iPad maybe compared to the phone just because it's big enough that you could do stuff like nobody is saying
[1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:38.860]  They want two apps on the same time on the iPhone or at least nobody's saying
[1:05:39.740 --> 1:05:41.260]  I
[1:05:41.260 --> 1:05:48.460]  Just feel like those sort of people gloss just gloss over how confusing computers in general are to to most people
[1:05:50.220 --> 1:05:55.260]  It's just if you understand it and you never really find yourself confused or lost on Mac OS 10
[1:05:55.260 --> 1:06:01.580]  You just can't it's just so hard. It's the same. It's the same people who think that widgets on Android or the killer feature
[1:06:01.580 --> 1:06:02.380]  Yeah, yeah
[1:06:02.380 --> 1:06:05.740]  I just saw something this week on ZDnet about how much more you quote
[1:06:05.740 --> 1:06:07.660]  I didn't link to it because it was you know
[1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:10.460]  It's like one of the things like you don't want to draw attention to something
[1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:12.940]  Yeah, and it wasn't the kind of was I think the guy meant it honestly
[1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:18.380]  But he said look at how you know how huge the usability advantage of Android is versus
[1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:22.380]  IOS
[1:06:22.380 --> 1:06:29.900]  Usability he called it and it was his his home screen on both devices and he carries both like for work for some reason
[1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:36.940]  He has an Android a galaxy and a iPhone and his iPhone home screen of course is just a bunch of apps and
[1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:42.860]  His Android home screen is a couple of apps and a bunch of widgets including a bunch of like a home automation
[1:06:42.860 --> 1:06:50.300]  One's so that he can like you know open his garage door and change his thermostat and do all the stuff without ever entering an app
[1:06:50.300 --> 1:06:52.300]  But do it right from his Android
[1:06:52.700 --> 1:06:53.980]  home screen
[1:06:53.980 --> 1:06:59.340]  Which is cool in a geeky way it's kind of you know and obviously it makes him happy and maybe you know
[1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:06.380]  He's too fiddly. Yeah, he's a perfect example of a sort of person who truly is better served by Android than Iowa
[1:07:06.380 --> 1:07:08.700]  That guy that guy he tries to hard
[1:07:08.700 --> 1:07:14.620]  But calling it a user. I know that I know who that is calling it a years years long
[1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:23.340]  Usability advantages. I think stretching it. I just feel like people vastly underestimate how big of a usability advantage for different people
[1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:26.540]  IOS has in terms of never making people feel like they're lost
[1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:28.300]  right
[1:07:28.300 --> 1:07:33.100]  Because what happens you're in two-screen mode and you hit the home button what happens
[1:07:33.100 --> 1:07:41.020]  Do both apps go away and replace with your home screen because that's what I would expect to happen because whenever I hit the home button
[1:07:41.180 --> 1:07:44.620]  I'm taken back to the safety of I'm back to ground zero
[1:07:45.340 --> 1:07:47.340]  Just a home screen full of apps
[1:07:47.900 --> 1:07:51.740]  There's a perfect solution for that what's that two home buttons
[1:07:57.500 --> 1:07:59.500]  Hold that thought
[1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:06.860]  Well, that thought and let me thank our third and final sponsor of the day are good friends at Squarespace

[1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:20.540]  Home button
[1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:25.340]  Two of them. Well, here's what I wanted to talk about talk about one home button
[1:10:25.340 --> 1:10:29.740]  So I don't know if you noticed as I tweeted a couple of times about it, but a couple of weeks ago. I bought
[1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:35.180]  I bought a Firefox phone. Firefox. Yeah, the ZTE
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:37.900]  Open C
[1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:39.900]  Firefox OS phone
[1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:43.980]  I saw it. I don't forget which side I was reading, but it said that they started to sell it in the US
[1:10:45.020 --> 1:10:48.940]  On eBay that it's like an eBay store. You just go there $99
[1:10:49.740 --> 1:10:51.740]  Smartphone unlocked
[1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.060]  Oh, it's on. Yeah, of course. It's on locked. So
[1:10:57.100 --> 1:11:02.300]  You just go there and you spend 99 bucks a couple days later. You get you get your phone
[1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:08.060]  Yeah, I guess I should write about it. I'm daring fireball. A lot of times I get these things and never end up writing about it, but
[1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:13.260]  Long story short. It's not not a good phone
[1:11:16.700 --> 1:11:18.700]  Oh darn
[1:11:18.380 --> 1:11:20.220]  B a
[1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:23.180]  One thing though that is interesting is that they copied
[1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:27.740]  Conceptually and I don't mean this in a pejorative way at all
[1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:33.660]  I just mean in terms of look they're following years behind the footsteps of them
[1:11:33.740 --> 1:11:37.900]  You know the modern smartphone, which is a touch screen device
[1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.660]  That more or less runs something that's like a you know a real computer operating system
[1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:47.180]  The post iPhone smartphone, right?
[1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:52.780]  And one thing that they got right is there's only one button on the front a home button
[1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:59.420]  There's a button, you know to turn it on it's got the exact same buttons as the iPhone except it doesn't have a mute switch
[1:11:59.740 --> 1:12:02.860]  So there's an on-off switch at the top just like the iPhone
[1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:08.060]  Volume up volume down on the side and then on the front face
[1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:14.700]  Underneath the screen. There's just a circle and that circle is the home button and the home button does exactly what the home button
[1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:18.580]  No, no, I found does is it takes you to a home screen full of out by guns
[1:12:18.580 --> 1:12:23.540]  So in one sense, I was actually I found myself very
[1:12:26.900 --> 1:12:32.900]  For an iPhone user you there's no way to get lost or confused. It's it's very very iPhone like in terms of
[1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:35.780]  What's the basic gist of how you use the thing?
[1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:42.820]  I would say in every other regard it is it's really pretty bad
[1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:47.140]  And I don't mean that you just pop your sim out and put it in that
[1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:52.820]  You know what I just you've got another I can't because my sim is a Verizon sim and it's a GSM phone
[1:12:53.540 --> 1:12:55.540]  So it doesn't work
[1:12:57.060 --> 1:13:04.500]  And I was I was going to go to T-Mobile and just get a buy a sim card from them because I've been curious
[1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:08.100]  I've been curious about T-Mobile ever since you know it just seems like they're the most
[1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:11.540]  Interact I don't know that I would say they're the best carrier right now in the US
[1:13:11.540 --> 1:13:17.780]  But they're the most interesting carrier that they seem to have the best plans the most the best pricing
[1:13:18.580 --> 1:13:23.220]  And a pretty cool, you know they just seem better like a better company than Verizon or AT&T
[1:13:23.700 --> 1:13:26.020]  I'll be it with a smaller network coverage
[1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:31.780]  Because but it's like 50 I think to start and that you can get one for it's like 50 bucks a month
[1:13:31.780 --> 1:13:34.020]  And it's prepaid you don't have to get on a contract or anything
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:37.060]  But even 50 bucks felt like too much to waste on this
[1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:41.780]  We're at $100. Well, you know, and I don't regret the $100. I feel like it
[1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:43.780]  I got a hundred dollars worth of
[1:13:43.780 --> 1:13:50.900]  Curiosity answered and just using it at home on the Wi-Fi network is more than enough to satisfy my questions about it
[1:13:50.900 --> 1:13:56.660]  I don't feel I don't feel like the ability to actually go out and use it outside the house right would answer anything other than
[1:13:57.300 --> 1:14:01.460]  You know, so I haven't been able to send any text messages because I don't have a sim card in it
[1:14:01.460 --> 1:14:04.100]  And I haven't been able to place an actual phone call
[1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:10.380]  But I don't like talking on the phone anyway. Who does yeah, who does that right? Who uses the phone any right of the phone
[1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:12.500]  All right, and when I say that it's not good
[1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:14.780]  It's that's who when I say that it's not good
[1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:21.740]  I do not mean in comparison to a $700 iPhone 5S which is truly not a fair comparison a
[1:14:22.180 --> 1:14:26.380]  $99 unlocked phone to an iPhone 5S that in the unlocked
[1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.500]  You know sells for seven or eight hundred dollars, which is that's not a fair comparison
[1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:34.820]  I would say and I don't have it here, so I can't you know
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:37.780]  I don't have one in the house, but
[1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:43.780]  Where Nokia has been going and I now Nokia's you know handset division is part of Microsoft and
[1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:50.220]  Motorola has been going on Android in terms of lower cost smartphones
[1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:56.060]  And I did see when I was out at build for the Microsoft conference a month ago. I saw a
[1:14:56.780 --> 1:14:58.780]  low-end Nokia
[1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:06.140]  Windows phone handset that I think unlocked was I could be wrong here, but I think it was like a hundred and twenty nine dollars
[1:15:08.100 --> 1:15:13.820]  Way better than this device like you know, and again not you know, definitely not iPhone 5
[1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:19.740]  5S 5C iPhone 5 anything, you know, caliber not even iPhone 4s caliber
[1:15:19.940 --> 1:15:24.460]  But pretty good like in terms of things like frame rate and you know
[1:15:24.460 --> 1:15:29.380]  Load a web page and slide your thumb around and it doesn't keep up with your thumb and stuff like that pretty good
[1:15:29.380 --> 1:15:35.180]  And I know Motorola has a new thing I forget which the model number is, but they have one that's like
[1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:39.460]  $129 and so they're not quite at the $99 price I paid for this, but
[1:15:40.460 --> 1:15:45.300]  129 to 99 is a pretty fair comparison and this this phone has got a lot of problems
[1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:53.900]  Video so when you shoot video on this phone, it's like 380 by like 240 pixels
[1:15:54.180 --> 1:16:00.020]  Which is really a pretty pretty low size and it's 15 frames per second
[1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:08.580]  So you're you know, I mean, it's it's almost like if that's all they were able to put in here
[1:16:08.580 --> 1:16:12.820]  I almost I mean, I guess it's better than nothing, but it's not much better than nothing
[1:16:12.820 --> 1:16:16.380]  Yeah, can you remember do you remember that the original iPhone didn't shoot video?
[1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:21.580]  Yeah, that's that I I caught myself
[1:16:22.540 --> 1:16:26.820]  Crazy, that's that right. I was like that can't be right and then they like went back and looked and I was like yep
[1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.580]  That was right
[1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:36.540]  But I do think I I'll bet that that was the sort of decision Apple made with the original iPhone where they probably could have done something like shot
[1:16:36.540 --> 1:16:44.340]  Posted stamped size 15 frames per second video and they were like it'd be better not to even shoot video than the offer video like that
[1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:46.620]  Eventually there was an app
[1:16:47.460 --> 1:16:48.980]  How did that work?
[1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:55.940]  Right that sort of when did video come to the iPhone was it was it in the was it in the 3G 3G s cuz the 3G s
[1:16:55.940 --> 1:17:03.820]  The 3G is only because it needed a better processor right the 3G only added 3G and a new a new case design
[1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:10.140]  Right, but technically it didn't didn't increase the CPU's, you know didn't increase the RAM didn't increase the storage
[1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:17.220]  The one and only technical difference other than the outside appearance between the original iPhone and the 3G was 3G
[1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:21.660]  Maybe there was a jailbreak app
[1:17:22.180 --> 1:17:24.060]  That added video
[1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:29.500]  To the earlier ones because I remember that there was one and I never I'd never installed it just because it but I think by the
[1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:34.460]  At that point I already moved on the camera is just really bad the video. It's not just that the video is low
[1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:37.220]  It's it really takes terrible terrible photographs
[1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:39.900]  and
[1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:43.660]  Again, I so with the Nokia one the Nokia's low end
[1:17:44.300 --> 1:17:52.900]  $129 smartphone the only photos I got to take I was in a room in Moscone where they had demo units set up for media to play with I mean
[1:17:53.260 --> 1:17:55.260]  But I could I
[1:17:55.260 --> 1:18:01.460]  The Nokia has a you know if anything they have it. Yeah, if anything Apple just Apple just hired their
[1:18:01.460 --> 1:18:07.980]  Yeah, yeah, and from everything I've read about it that's a pretty big hire that he wasn't just it's not just the name
[1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:11.900]  He actually was largely you know play a big part in making Nokia
[1:18:12.260 --> 1:18:14.420]  They're either one and two or two and one
[1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:17.980]  I mean that's you know more or less suggests is that the two best companies that
[1:18:18.540 --> 1:18:23.460]  Mobile photography right now are Apple and Nokia and it doesn't matter which one you think is one and which ones too
[1:18:23.460 --> 1:18:32.820]  You know, they're just leading the way in terms of image quality and features and stuff and this phone from ZTE is just it just feels like it's at least 10 years old
[1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:39.220]  And it makes me wonder about Firefox in general. I mean, I you know
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:43.340]  I've never was never really a full-time Firefox user on the on the desktop
[1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:51.500]  But it just it's like I why are they wait it just feels to me like this is just a waste of time on their part
[1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:55.540]  I don't know and I feel like they're they feel locked out because
[1:18:55.980 --> 1:19:00.500]  These mobile platforms don't allow at least iOS certainly doesn't allow
[1:19:01.340 --> 1:19:09.620]  them to include their own rendering engine, you know, even Chrome doesn't get to Chrome for iOS doesn't use the Chrome rendering engine
[1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:13.220]  It's just a Chrome wrapper around the system's WebKit version
[1:19:14.820 --> 1:19:17.380]  You know, and so if you're a company like Mozilla that
[1:19:17.380 --> 1:19:26.220]  You know that the whole point of your existence is to have your rendering and it engine out there powering people surfing the web
[1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:31.100]  I could see why you would want a mobile operating system of your own so you could do it
[1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:37.540]  But if this is how far behind your art boy, it's it's gonna be tough to get anybody to I just can't see why anybody would buy it
[1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.220]  If you have the $99 to spend on it
[1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:49.420]  I just can't see why you wouldn't save up another 30 and get a Motorola Android phone or get a Nokia Windows 8 phone when you get so much more and
[1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:51.740]  Much more likely to get the Android phone
[1:19:52.180 --> 1:19:57.740]  Well statistically more people would get the Android phone. Yeah. Well, they would right now at least statistically although
[1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:00.980]  You know, because you're buying into a bigger ecosystem
[1:20:01.340 --> 1:20:04.260]  Right I've just feel and I feel like the only other reason I can think of that
[1:20:04.260 --> 1:20:10.820]  I'm someone would buy this phone would be the politics of it, you know, that you support the whole political angle of
[1:20:10.820 --> 1:20:12.820]  Mozilla
[1:20:13.260 --> 1:20:19.820]  And the you know open web and etc etc, but I just don't see how there's enough people out there that that's that's statistically
[1:20:20.420 --> 1:20:22.420]  valid number of people
[1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:25.020]  Right, oh, it looks like it erased my notebook
[1:20:27.220 --> 1:20:36.380]  I had some notes, but there they were written using the notebook app on the actual phone and and it seems as though now they're they're gone
[1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:40.300]  That's a shame. I can remember a lot of them
[1:20:40.780 --> 1:20:46.900]  One of the big problems with this operating system is that it does not support selecting text
[1:20:48.420 --> 1:20:53.820]  So right so there's no cut copy or so it's a lot like the original life. It is and you know
[1:20:53.820 --> 1:20:58.500]  And there's you know, I twitted about some of these things and people you know who who support you know
[1:20:59.500 --> 1:21:01.660]  You know who are fans of that I guess
[1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:08.180]  You know try to call me a hypocrite for it that you know, how is it okay for Apple in
[1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:11.820]  2007 when now I phone this new and it's not okay now well that's because it's not
[1:21:12.220 --> 1:21:16.100]  2007 anymore, right it's you know the world's moved on and
[1:21:19.940 --> 1:21:24.020]  Other people called me out the other way and when I said that it was unacceptable
[1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:29.540]  It was acceptable for Apple then but it's unacceptable now and they said no it was unacceptable for Apple then too
[1:21:29.540 --> 1:21:31.540]  It used to drive me nuts
[1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:37.940]  But my point to them is that no that was annoying then it was like an obvious shortcoming
[1:21:37.940 --> 1:21:42.900]  But it was clearly acceptable because we were using it and you're even admitting that you still used it, right?
[1:21:42.900 --> 1:21:46.540]  We were frustrated by it, but we still use it. I when I say it's unacceptable now
[1:21:46.540 --> 1:21:50.740]  I mean I can't imagine why someone would buy this phone where they can't select
[1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:57.140]  Copy and paste when for about the same amount of money. They could buy a different one that does I mean everything has to be taken in
[1:21:57.140 --> 1:22:02.620]  Context right like I mean the context of 2007 was the iPhone was an
[1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:05.500]  Amazing phone for the time
[1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:10.620]  Even with flaws right that people and we did put up with it with those shortcomings
[1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:12.980]  And I just can't see why someone would put up with these now
[1:22:13.820 --> 1:22:18.820]  I can't believe that it erased my notes. I think it's because I might let the battery die. I don't know
[1:22:19.980 --> 1:22:22.860]  I didn't like what you were saying about it. Yeah, maybe yeah
[1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:31.660]  You can't and you know even the web browser which you would think would be the one thing that might be good because it's you know
[1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:34.220]  Firefox's own thing
[1:22:34.500 --> 1:22:36.660]  It's not good
[1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:40.300]  You can't do things like jump like when you're scrolled down
[1:22:40.300 --> 1:22:46.180]  You can't jump to the top like it doesn't have the iPhone thing where you just tap to status bar and scroll to the top
[1:22:46.260 --> 1:22:51.260]  But the only way to get to the interface to manage your multiple tabs is at the top
[1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:55.580]  So if you're scrolled down on a web page and you want to switch to another tab that's open
[1:22:55.660 --> 1:23:01.900]  You have to sit there and flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick flick and and
[1:23:02.300 --> 1:23:06.460]  It doesn't really have a lot of inertia either so if it's a long enough page that you've been reading
[1:23:06.460 --> 1:23:12.100]  I'm not exaggerating how many flicks you need to get to the top which is where the
[1:23:13.180 --> 1:23:16.540]  Tab management is and there's no
[1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.060]  bookmarks
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:27.260]  Therefore, there's no bookmark let's and I use you know, it's there's no book there are no bookmarks. I didn't know
[1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:30.340]  Not that I can tell
[1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:33.380]  I don't know if there's bookmarks. I don't know how you how you make them
[1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:41.500]  Well, I guess our bookmarks here. Oh, yeah, I've just found it. Well, let's just say that the bookmarks are hidden
[1:23:45.860 --> 1:23:47.860]  It's not intuitive no
[1:23:47.860 --> 1:23:53.900]  Not intuitive the email client isn't too bad. It's got a decent. I'm app client. It's usable at least
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:24:00.660]  But they just and you know, and it's this whole is it Thunderbird is it branded Thunderbird is that no?
[1:24:00.660 --> 1:24:04.060]  Are they owned by I don't know if they talked about Thunderbird anymore
[1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:06.820]  No, they call it it's just called email and in fact
[1:24:06.820 --> 1:24:12.100]  I think what's interesting is they they spell it e dash capital M a i l which
[1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:15.560]  To me looks like and I you know God knows I love some
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:23.800]  Curmudgeonly grammar and spelling and stuff like that, but the dash and email feels kind of old timey feels a little
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.320]  1990s
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:30.560]  And I have a thing called marketplace which is like their app store
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:36.120]  but really it's just sort of like a directory of mobile operated mobile-optimized websites and
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:40.520]  When you create an app and download an app out of one of these things
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:46.920]  It's really just you know like when you're on the iOS like when you use the plus button and save a web page as an app
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:49.520]  And it just you just lose the browser Chrome
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:54.240]  So that's like what the Twitter app for this thing is the Twitter app is just a
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:59.760]  It seems a little bit different than when you go to Twitter on an iPhone, but not much
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.320]  And I haven't done that in so long and therefore though you can't do anything now
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:14.120]  You can't do anything like have two different accounts any more than you can have two accounts on you know the Twitter website
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:16.120]  There's no account switching
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:22.640]  So it's just you know when you use Twitter on this. It's just the mobile Twitter website
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.280]  Yeah, I can't remember that those days of using
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:33.920]  Like the mobile major league baseball site and all those the WAP system mobile. Yeah, right. Right. No, that's a lot like using this
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:37.120]  Mostly mostly because of edge. All right
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:39.840]  not because
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:44.320]  They were better. They were just they load it faster
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.480]  All right, and so on the one hand
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:52.560]  There's the web and what you call the web as a developer can mean different things to different people and one thing could just be using
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:57.680]  HTML CSS and JavaScript to do the actual
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.720]  layout and development of
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:05.960]  Of the app and web OS worked that way right from palm and later HP
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:14.080]  Where apps were really just sort of like bundles that inside were implemented using HTML CSS and JavaScript and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:21.840]  Although there's some performance problems you have to overcome if you want to be compared favorably to native code
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:24.160]  like
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:26.160]  Objective C running on iOS or
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:30.640]  Even the Java type byte code that you run on Android
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:38.360]  But it could be overcome, but what Firefox OS does really is just load things
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:46.920]  You know actual websites over the internet and save them and so a lot of stuff stops working if you don't have an internet connection
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:50.720]  Like there's games they called there's games you can get
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:55.360]  But then if you don't have an internet connection the games don't load because you can't connect to the server anymore
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:57.360]  And it's not entirely cached locally
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:01.200]  And I just don't feel like there's any
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:03.960]  You know
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:08.400]  I don't we haven't gotten to a place where always having an internet connection is a thing, right?
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:10.720]  right
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.880]  I
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:17.720]  Thought of you because what was the thing you bought you bought the for similar reasons like hey
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.960]  I want to find out what the how the other side lives you bought the fire tablet right
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:23.640]  now I bought the
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:26.560]  Nexus 7 Nexus 7. Yeah, how's that going?
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:31.400]  It's under somewhere
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:38.840]  Didn't work out that great. No, it was it was it was all right. I mean, it's you know for
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  I mean I think in that case at the price
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.240]  Because it was only you know this was a couple years ago now and it was only 200 bucks
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:53.040]  It was like an eight gigabyte. It was a better price point that there wasn't an iPad available at that price point and
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:28:01.080]  You know, there's it's an ecosystem that has apps and Android is a full-fledged operating system
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:03.720]  so it was okay, but I
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:10.640]  You know not a year into using it. I ended up having battery problems and then
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:13.280]  You know had to had to reset it
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:19.000]  Recondition it to get it to the point where it would really hold a charge for a good amount of time and then I
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:23.160]  One of the things I wanted to use it for was listening to music on
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.840]  You know on my desk as I was working and it was just
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:32.200]  There was a lot of bleed through in the device of
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:40.280]  Sound, you know, the wood from other electronics the kind of problems that we used to have with I mean it seems like we used to have those problems like I
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:45.520]  I used to have to turn off yeah that the phone to do a podcast or that kind of thing
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:49.360]  Or if you got your headphones too close to your laptop, you'd get a weird
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:51.040]  feedback
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:52.200]  Yeah
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:57.680]  And it wasn't it's not it wasn't the headphone because it's the same headphones that I use with my iPhone and everything else and I don't
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:59.760]  Get it with any other device other than
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:02.280]  Other than that
[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:06.600]  So the other thing about this Firefox phone it has a 4.0 inch
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:11.680]  Screen I think the aspect ratio is a little bit wider when you're holding it in
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:18.720]  Portrait then the iPhone but roughly it's roughly an iPhone size device, and I do find that comfortable
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:24.280]  I did I don't find myself wishing that the screen were bigger. I don't know. I feel like I don't know
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:30.320]  I feel like I'm gonna it's gonna be a problem for me if if the new iPhone is bigger
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.280]  Yeah, I know yeah, I mean I'll wait and
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:35.400]  It's
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:38.960]  Till I see it, but I don't feel like I I want a bigger iPhone
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:41.160]  You know particularly I'm curious the other thing
[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:45.280]  I guess I'm curious about and it occurred to me when I was thinking about how all the buttons are the same as the
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:49.960]  iPhone except for the lack of a mute switch, but most phones don't have mute switches and
[1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:56.280]  Apple who is notoriously sort of minimalist on including hardware buttons, you know
[1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:59.280]  It I love the mute switch on the iPhone
[1:29:59.280 --> 1:30:05.280]  I I don't like whenever I try out these other phones and you have to do like for this one the way to get into
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:09.840]  Mute is you hold down the power button and instead of you know like as though to turn off the phone
[1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:15.920]  But you get a menu with four options turn off airplane mode or turn it on
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:21.860]  Silence incoming calls restart power off, and I think Android does the same thing where if you want to
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:29.000]  At least an Android phone that I had a while ago did where if you wanted to turn off the sound you hold down the power button
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:33.040]  Wait for a menu to come up and then hit it. I love that like
[1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:37.280]  You know at the start of my
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:42.440]  Sun's concert a couple weeks ago. I didn't even have to take my phone out of my pocket
[1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:48.520]  I just you know just toggled stick your hand in and yeah, just toggle the switch and then I know it's not gonna make a sound I
[1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:51.520]  Do the opposite I mean I
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:57.200]  Deal I almost always have it in mute and only when I'm expecting a call that I want
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:01.080]  Right turn do I turn it off mute. Yeah, I could do that too
[1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:04.400]  Or just to double check it really you lay out a lot of times when I want to turn on mute
[1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.200]  It already is on mute and I don't turn it off
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.400]  I thought you were gonna say that you do the opposite and when your son's school is gonna have a constant
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:14.720]  You turn your phone up real loud. I gotta take this. Sorry
[1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:20.560]  You were gonna say it's been 45 minutes in the lobby
[1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:23.800]  Drinking
[1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:31.080]  Please turn off and silence here. I do the opposite. You're not gonna tell me when this silence my phone. I'll turn a mine up
[1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:42.040]  And I've set my ringtone to it a song with inappropriate lyrics get wrestled out of the school program by some some bouncers
[1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:48.840]  Now I'd seen like back in the fall. It's you know few things
[1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:55.120]  People predicting that Firefox OS was really gonna take off and change the
[1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:59.800]  Playing field if they had come out with this in 2009
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:02.400]  You know two years after the iPhone
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:07.720]  I would say maybe you know, you know because that's when Android was new too, right?
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:14.360]  I think like it was maybe a little bit ahead of that, but it was I think it was the end of 2008 when the first
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:21.840]  Android phone came out the HTC was at the HTC one forget what it was called, but I think it was brown and
[1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.040]  Had a you know keyboard that came out of the side
[1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:32.120]  And had a lot of problems had a lot of problems just like this where you know, it was it was like they were still
[1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:40.600]  Growing out, you know, they'd started with the idea of an operating system that required a keyboard and required an up-down left-right
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:46.600]  Device so if you wanted to select text on that Android phone you had to use the rollerball you couldn't use your finger on the touch screen
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.600]  You had to go to the rollerball
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:57.880]  You know, it just feels like something from that era. It's just it's just a long long time ago though since I could have
[1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:01.840]  You know use the phone of any operating system or you can't even select text
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:09.480]  It just feels you know bizarre right just feels like and it just makes me think that Mozilla as a whole is just often their own
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:16.320]  cocoon and echo chamber in terms of you know the politics of the whole thing of the only reason keeping it afloat and
[1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:19.440]  and
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:21.440]  whatever remaining
[1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:30.240]  Traction or momentum I guess that they have of all the people who switched to Firefox on Windows a decade ago
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:37.000]  You know still giving them some revenue because they go up to the search bar and search through Google and that they have a
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.800]  You know revenue share deal with Google, but that's it's all
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:45.520]  You know everything that's going on that that gives them any value is is 10 years old
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:49.640]  Like they're still nowhere in terms of actual mobile
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:56.680]  Kind of sad yeah, but not surprising but open but totally open
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:59.320]  John mulch. Thanks for joining me
