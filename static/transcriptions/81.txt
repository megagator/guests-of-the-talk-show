[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  Are you recording?
[00:01.840 --> 00:03.640]  I am recording now.
[00:03.640 --> 00:05.640]  We could do like a...
[00:05.640 --> 00:06.640]  Yes?
[00:06.640 --> 00:09.240]  Yeah, one, two, three.
[00:09.240 --> 00:10.240]  But should we do that?
[00:10.240 --> 00:11.240]  One, two, three?
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.680]  Well, we could just clap our hands.
[00:12.680 --> 00:13.680]  I already started.
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.680]  Do you want me to stop and do that?
[00:14.680 --> 00:16.240]  No, I thought you were...
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.980]  Are you going to have to edit this now?
[00:17.980 --> 00:22.400]  You're not going to edit this?
[00:22.400 --> 00:24.620]  I swear to God, you're not going to do that?
[00:24.620 --> 00:25.720]  You wouldn't like that.
[00:25.720 --> 00:30.560]  I was going to clap just for the sake of you.
[00:30.560 --> 00:31.560]  I don't think...
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.560]  Here's my thing.
[00:32.560 --> 00:37.840]  I don't think that the listeners of the show, they shouldn't notice a damn thing.
[00:37.840 --> 01:03.360]  It should just...
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.600]  They won't even know that anything has changed.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.600]  Quality wise.
[01:09.600 --> 01:10.600]  I guess they would.
[01:10.600 --> 01:11.600]  Why would they?
[01:11.600 --> 01:12.600]  Editing wise.
[01:12.600 --> 01:16.920]  I still got to dot the I's and cross the T's on the feed redirection and stuff like that.
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.040]  Yeah, right.
[01:19.040 --> 01:20.360]  But that's not my problem.
[01:20.360 --> 01:21.360]  Or is that my problem?
[01:21.360 --> 01:23.400]  That is your problem too.
[01:23.400 --> 01:33.120]  No, I think it seems as though any well-written podcast client, if they get a 302 HTTP, which
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.120]  is...
[01:34.120 --> 01:37.680]  Like a 301 says redirect, go over there, but don't...
[01:37.680 --> 01:38.680]  Not permanently.
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.820]  302 is permanent and then it should remember the new URL.
[01:42.820 --> 01:49.680]  So if you were previously subscribed at muleradio.net slash the talk show, whatever the feed URL
[01:49.680 --> 01:57.120]  is, your podcast software will just automatically update to daringfireball.net feeds the talk
[01:57.120 --> 01:58.120]  show or whatever.
[01:58.120 --> 01:59.120]  I don't know.
[01:59.120 --> 02:02.840]  I haven't decided on the URL yet.
[02:02.840 --> 02:06.480]  But nobody should notice a damn thing.
[02:06.480 --> 02:09.600]  Ah, Christ.
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.520]  Now you're back.
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.240]  How does that happen?
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.820]  Starting out splendidly.
[02:22.820 --> 02:23.820]  No quality problems.
[02:23.820 --> 02:28.860]  Skype problems are endemic to podcasting.
[02:28.860 --> 02:29.860]  No problems whatsoever.
[02:29.860 --> 02:37.400]  Did you see the rumor today just broke hours before we started recording that Twitter might
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.400]  buy SoundCloud?
[02:38.400 --> 02:39.400]  Yeah.
[02:39.400 --> 02:42.400]  That won't mess with anybody.
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.120]  No, that won't.
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.120]  But it's funny.
[02:45.120 --> 02:51.680]  Dan Fromer, friend of the show, occasional guest of the talk show, pointed out the sort
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.580]  of irony in that is that SoundCloud is effectively Odeo 2.0.
[02:57.580 --> 03:07.200]  And Odeo was like, hey, this must be like back in like 2004, 2005.
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.460]  But it was Ev Williams and Biz Stone and all these guys, you know, they left Google after
[03:12.460 --> 03:13.460]  Blogger.
[03:13.460 --> 03:16.200]  It was like Google bought Blogger.
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.360]  And then when their time was up, they all got the hell out of Google and they made Odeo
[03:19.360 --> 03:25.440]  and it was going to be like Blogger for podcasting.
[03:25.440 --> 03:28.360]  It just they just didn't seem it seemed, you know, it's a good idea.
[03:28.360 --> 03:33.420]  I mean, they were on to something in terms of like back in 2004, 2005, thinking podcasting
[03:33.420 --> 03:36.280]  was going to be big.
[03:36.280 --> 03:41.360]  Clearly they're at it, you know, at the base of the fundamental idea, there's pretty good
[03:41.360 --> 03:42.600]  and ahead of its time.
[03:42.600 --> 03:44.360]  But they didn't ever get quite got it to work.
[03:44.360 --> 03:48.440]  And then it was like one of their guys, you know, guy named Jack is over there.
[03:48.440 --> 03:50.520]  And they were like, anybody else have any ideas?
[03:50.520 --> 03:54.220]  And Jeff Dorsey is like, I got an idea.
[03:54.220 --> 03:57.040]  And it turned into Twitter, Twitter.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.040]  Yeah.
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.760]  But the Odeo, the Odeo really didn't it was a separate company, though, right?
[04:02.760 --> 04:10.000]  Well, it well, it was start Twitter started as an Odeo product and it and I'm not quite
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.120]  sure what the legal you know, so at some point, you know, lawyers came in and it went from
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.760]  Twitter being an Odeo product to Twitter being a standalone, you know, corporation.
[04:23.760 --> 04:26.440]  Yeah, it was spun off.
[04:26.440 --> 04:32.800]  But Twitter date started life as a product of the Odeo Corporation.
[04:32.800 --> 04:34.680]  I've got an Odeo t shirt.
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.320]  Nothing happened to that.
[04:36.320 --> 04:37.320]  To Odeo?
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.320]  Yeah.
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.520]  I think they changed the name to the Obvious Corporation.
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.120]  I think it might.
[04:44.120 --> 04:45.120]  Yeah.
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.640]  Which I think is still the parent company of Medium.
[04:48.640 --> 04:51.000]  You know, that's the new thing that Oh, really?
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  Okay.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.800]  So that got that they just when he started that, he just started under that umbrella.
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.440]  Yeah, I think I you know, and again, is there really a difference if they just I don't know,
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.680]  maybe they just dissolved Odeo and started a new company called Obvious or I think they
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.560]  changed the name, though, you know, just to like save on paperwork or something.
[05:10.560 --> 05:11.560]  I don't know.
[05:11.560 --> 05:17.000]  Like, it might have been easier to just change the name of Odeo to the Obvious Corporation.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  Right.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.960]  Anyway, are you are you playing on using SoundCloud?
[05:21.960 --> 05:22.960]  I guess so.
[05:22.960 --> 05:31.640]  I mean, it's I don't want to get Well, it's funny, because now that I have to worry about
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.840]  every single detail of hosting the podcast, and there are it's like, you know, I don't
[05:35.840 --> 05:42.840]  know how much of the details you're taking care of with the what's the parenting show?
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.120]  Get back in and turn this car around.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.120]  Yes, turning this car around.
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.680]  I was going to call it Don't make me go back there.
[05:52.680 --> 05:56.280]  That was also in the running.
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.280]  We had we did it.
[05:57.280 --> 06:02.280]  We had a long list of things that dad say, yeah, that was probably that was probably
[06:02.280 --> 06:04.640]  in there someplace.
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.640]  But there are there's all sorts of details you have to worry about.
[06:07.640 --> 06:13.640]  And and a fundamental one is where do you store the audio files?
[06:13.640 --> 06:15.280]  Yeah.
[06:15.280 --> 06:22.240]  It would cost, according to my calculations, a couple of $1,000 a month for me to host
[06:22.240 --> 06:30.660]  the audio on Amazon s3 could be off by a little but I'm probably not off by a lot.
[06:30.660 --> 06:36.240]  Which is, you know, start talking about hundreds of dollars, and I might just squander it thousands
[06:36.240 --> 06:38.840]  of dollars, you've got my attention.
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.760]  And SoundCloud is free this I mean, I don't want to get too inside baseball here.
[06:42.760 --> 06:50.280]  But to me, it's a sort of an interesting it's the perils of venture backed cloud services.
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.640]  So SoundCloud is free for everything.
[06:53.640 --> 06:57.780]  And it's started life, I guess, it's sort of a music hosting service where musicians
[06:57.780 --> 07:01.240]  could put songs up and have people playing, but they don't, you know, they let you put
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.360]  anything up there, including podcasts.
[07:04.360 --> 07:10.400]  And you can put your podcast there and they don't insert their own ads, they have a player
[07:10.400 --> 07:13.920]  that you can embed, like if you've got, you know, if anybody's ever looked at the talk
[07:13.920 --> 07:19.600]  show pages on mule radio, they use the SoundCloud embeddable player.
[07:19.600 --> 07:21.200]  That's yeah, that's what that's what we use.
[07:21.200 --> 07:26.280]  And it but that doesn't really have ads, it has SoundCloud branding, but you don't have
[07:26.280 --> 07:34.120]  to use their audio player, you know, like, Dave Whiskas is unprofessional show.
[07:34.120 --> 07:38.000]  Him and Jamie Newberry now are the host of that I forget who used to be the host.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.080]  Well, what's his I always forget that guy's name, Lex.
[07:43.080 --> 07:45.920]  That's it, Lex, right.
[07:45.920 --> 07:48.080]  Who is on my parenting podcast?
[07:48.080 --> 07:49.080]  He is?
[07:49.080 --> 07:50.080]  Yes.
[07:50.080 --> 07:53.680]  He never speaks up.
[07:53.680 --> 07:54.920]  All I ever hear is you and John.
[07:54.920 --> 07:57.080]  Are you giving him the Casey treatment?
[07:57.080 --> 07:59.240]  Isn't this called the Casey treatment?
[07:59.240 --> 08:00.480]  They should do a show.
[08:00.480 --> 08:01.680]  They should do a show.
[08:01.680 --> 08:03.880]  And they should be called like those guys.
[08:03.880 --> 08:04.880]  The other guys.
[08:04.880 --> 08:06.120]  Yeah, right.
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.120]  The other guys.
[08:07.120 --> 08:10.920]  Oh, my God, that'd be great.
[08:10.920 --> 08:14.560]  They should pretend to be each other.
[08:14.560 --> 08:15.560]  Just to confuse things.
[08:15.560 --> 08:21.840]  But I got an unprofessional he hosts the their audio with SoundCloud, but he uses a different,
[08:21.840 --> 08:25.660]  you know, HTML5 audio player.
[08:25.660 --> 08:27.520]  And it all seems too good to be true.
[08:27.520 --> 08:32.240]  And because behind the scenes, SoundCloud hosts your audio on Amazon S3.
[08:32.240 --> 08:38.160]  And so, you know, it's it's hundreds of it for a popular enough show, thousands of dollars
[08:38.160 --> 08:46.280]  worth of S3 bandwidth that SoundCloud is just covering based on the like 60 million dollars
[08:46.280 --> 08:48.920]  they've raised in, you know, venture capital.
[08:48.920 --> 08:49.920]  Yeah.
[08:49.920 --> 08:54.520]  So it's a perfect fit for Twitter, right?
[08:54.520 --> 08:56.280]  And no idea how to monetize this.
[08:56.280 --> 08:57.280]  Right.
[08:57.280 --> 09:03.240]  Like with like my friends and as I've been talking and planning and plotting and detailing,
[09:03.240 --> 09:09.120]  you know, everything I have to do to move the talk show to be part of during Fireball.
[09:09.120 --> 09:10.760]  And I see I hear that.
[09:10.760 --> 09:14.680]  And I think, well, that's too good to be true and too good to be true is to me, it makes
[09:14.680 --> 09:15.680]  me very uncomfortable.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.140]  I'd rather pay a reasonable amount of money for something that I feel is sustainable than
[09:21.140 --> 09:22.140]  do it.
[09:22.140 --> 09:25.080]  And I say this to some people and some people hear it and they, you know, and they think,
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.080]  oh, yeah, you have a good point.
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.080]  That is a little worrisome.
[09:27.080 --> 09:30.560]  And then other people are like, just take the free hosting dummy and, you know, worry
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.600]  about what you do when it goes away, when it goes away, wait for the bell.
[09:35.600 --> 09:38.120]  You have an established podcast.
[09:38.120 --> 09:45.520]  So in your situation, it's a little easier, you know, with established sponsors and such.
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.320]  So it's a little easier to actually go out and shell something out.
[09:48.320 --> 09:49.320]  But like, right.
[09:49.320 --> 09:51.840]  You know, when we started up, we didn't have any we didn't have any advertisers to begin
[09:51.840 --> 09:52.840]  with.
[09:52.840 --> 09:56.040]  And so it would have been a lot harder, right?
[09:56.040 --> 09:59.080]  It's not that I have a lot of confidence that I was going to go someplace.
[09:59.080 --> 10:01.480]  And there's other options besides Amazon S3.
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.440]  There's, you know, all sorts of things like, you know, one could do to host a podcast,
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.280]  but they're, you know, because SoundCloud offers a good quality, you know, because it's
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.280]  backed by S3.
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.040]  I'm they don't tell you that, but it just if you poke around and see where your stuff's
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.880]  coming from, it seems like it is good quality.
[10:20.880 --> 10:23.460]  It works around the world, which is often a problem.
[10:23.460 --> 10:29.120]  Like if you were just to do like the obvious thing and just get like, you know, Linux server
[10:29.120 --> 10:33.400]  and start just put your audio files there and let people download it like in people
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.480]  around the world might have trouble getting it whereas something that's meant to be a
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.760]  content delivery system, like S3 works better.
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.360]  And then you don't have to pay it's right.
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.040]  And again, like you said, it seems like a perfect fit for Twitter.
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.280]  You guys have no, you guys have exorbitant costs and no idea how to make money for it.
[10:55.280 --> 11:03.540]  We're going to, we're going to spend, you should be dollars on you guys.
[11:03.540 --> 11:05.820]  You should come work with us.
[11:05.820 --> 11:06.820]  All sorts of acquisitions.
[11:06.820 --> 11:07.820]  Who does Mark?
[11:07.820 --> 11:08.820]  Where is it?
[11:08.820 --> 11:09.820]  This is, there's another one.
[11:09.820 --> 11:11.680]  And Marco uses something else.
[11:11.680 --> 11:12.680]  What's libsyn?
[11:12.680 --> 11:13.680]  Libsyn?
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.680]  Yeah.
[11:14.680 --> 11:15.680]  Yeah.
[11:15.680 --> 11:16.680]  Yeah.
[11:16.680 --> 11:17.680]  I don't know anything about that one.
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.080]  They're a little bit less, uh, nebulous in terms of the money.
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.400]  Like they have like some kind of tiering and paid accounts and, and something, I don't
[11:28.400 --> 11:29.400]  know.
[11:29.400 --> 11:32.040]  Uh, Amy, uh, what's her name?
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.280]  And Paul, have a show then they use libsyn too.
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.280]  I'm so bad with names.
[11:38.280 --> 11:39.280]  Yeah.
[11:39.280 --> 11:40.280]  Yeah.
[11:40.280 --> 11:41.280]  I understand.
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.280]  That's why I like to have you on the show.
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.080]  You just have to remember what your name is.
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.120]  He's got the same name that I've got.
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.560]  Does it ever bother you that Armstrong doesn't have an age?
[11:53.560 --> 11:54.560]  Yeah.
[11:54.560 --> 11:56.200]  He must be a Jonathan, right?
[11:56.200 --> 11:59.200]  Whenever I see a J O N I just, that's what that is.
[11:59.200 --> 12:02.360]  I assume that you're a Jonathan, right?
[12:02.360 --> 12:03.360]  But we're not, right?
[12:03.360 --> 12:06.240]  I mean, you're, no, no, no.
[12:06.240 --> 12:13.640]  I see J O N and I think you're really a Jonathan and you're just pretending to be a John.
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.160]  And then when other people will say to me, if they say, Hey, is your real name Jonathan
[12:17.160 --> 12:18.160]  group?
[12:18.160 --> 12:19.160]  Is your full name Jonathan group?
[12:19.160 --> 12:22.120]  Or then I'm offended because I'm like, no, I have an age.
[12:22.120 --> 12:31.000]  Were you, uh, were you named after somebody, uh, sort of long story short, um, uh, I was
[12:31.000 --> 12:39.760]  the first child and my mom, uh, this is before any kind of ultrasound type technology.
[12:39.760 --> 12:48.000]  So when my mom was pregnant with me in 1972, um, all they knew was that she was pregnant
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.120]  and the sound had not been invented, nope, sounded and neither or nor had color.
[12:52.120 --> 12:53.960]  Um, right, right.
[12:53.960 --> 12:58.760]  But my mom was a hundred percent convinced that she was having a girl.
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.760]  She'd had no children before, but she just felt like she was having a girl.
[13:02.760 --> 13:09.840]  And she even has, she still has it like, uh, a little like back pocket sized book of baby
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  names.
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.700]  Like the sort of little, almost like a pamphlet book with thousands of names.
[13:14.700 --> 13:18.280]  But it's, you know, it's, it's like, you can fit in like, it's like the size of a field
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.560]  notes, but 45 names, uh, that, you know, you used to buy books like that in a supermarket.
[13:23.560 --> 13:31.360]  Uh, and she has it and, and like the girl pages are all like worn, you know, there's
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.720]  also, and there's, there's annotated dozens and dozens of names circled and then different
[13:35.720 --> 13:37.280]  colors for like second.
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.640]  And there's like two boys names.
[13:38.640 --> 13:45.640]  It was like Jason and uh, I forget the other one, uh, I didn't like it though.
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.640]  Um, but there were like two boys names that were like vaguely underlined and that was
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.640]  it.
[13:50.640 --> 13:51.640]  That was the only thought she'd put into it.
[13:51.640 --> 13:56.800]  And then I came out and they said, it's a boy and she goes, no, it's not.
[13:56.800 --> 14:04.080]  And my dad put it back and, and, uh, and she was upset cause she didn't know, she just
[14:04.080 --> 14:06.480]  was so sure it was a girl that had no names picked out.
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.960]  And my dad was not in a room because this was 1973 and men still not done in a, he was
[14:12.960 --> 14:19.000]  in a smoke filled room with a bunch of cigars and probably like a six pack or something.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  Sure.
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.640]  And then they came in and they said, uh, you know, good news, your wife had a baby, it's
[14:25.640 --> 14:27.160]  a healthy boy.
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.840]  And my dad, I guess he joined my mom and they, and she said, well, what are we going to call
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.840]  him?
[14:31.840 --> 14:34.400]  And he discusses his name is John.
[14:34.400 --> 14:35.400]  And that was it.
[14:35.400 --> 14:36.620]  There was like no discussion.
[14:36.620 --> 14:42.080]  My mom had spent like hours and hours over the proceeding, like eight months picking
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.000]  out girls names and my, they'd never discussed it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.960]  And my dad just goes, his name is John.
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.840]  Now it ends up that both, both of my grandparents, her dad and my dad's dad were both named John.
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.840]  Oh, okay.
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.320]  So, uh, you know, everybody felt honored.
[14:57.320 --> 14:58.320]  Right.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.320]  Yeah.
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.840]  What about you?
[15:00.840 --> 15:01.840]  You named after anybody?
[15:01.840 --> 15:02.840]  Yeah.
[15:02.840 --> 15:08.300]  My grandfather, my mom's dad, he passed away like, uh, six months before I was born.
[15:08.300 --> 15:10.300]  So I was named after him.
[15:10.300 --> 15:11.300]  Tragic.
[15:11.300 --> 15:12.300]  Yeah.
[15:12.300 --> 15:13.300]  It's a good name.
[15:13.300 --> 15:14.300]  Smoke kids.
[15:14.300 --> 15:15.300]  Don't smoke.
[15:15.300 --> 15:17.960]  It's a good name.
[15:17.960 --> 15:19.520]  Gets me through the day.
[15:19.520 --> 15:20.520]  Yeah.
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.120]  Uh, lots of other acquisitions in the news.
[15:24.120 --> 15:30.560]  So uh, in, in near, near acquisitions, tortured, continuing tortured acquisitions.
[15:30.560 --> 15:31.560]  Yes.
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.360]  Well the, the beats one, which I thought would have been old news by the time we were recording
[15:35.360 --> 15:37.920]  this is still not still at limbo.
[15:37.920 --> 15:41.960]  It's still actually not news like that.
[15:41.960 --> 15:44.080]  We're getting close to two weeks now, right?
[15:44.080 --> 15:47.520]  Since it'll be like the end of this week, it'll be two weeks Friday.
[15:47.520 --> 15:48.520]  Right.
[15:48.520 --> 15:52.640]  And a lot of people have been writing to me, you know, at daring fireball emailing saying
[15:52.640 --> 15:55.480]  like, Hey, maybe this whole thing is just nonsense.
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.960]  And you know, Apple not denying it is just their usual, you know, we don't comment one
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.920]  way or the other because if they, and there might be, you know, who knows?
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.280]  I don't, I actually don't know, but you know, the, the idea would be, well, why wouldn't
[16:09.280 --> 16:11.860]  Apple just publicly deny it if it weren't true?
[16:11.860 --> 16:16.880]  The idea then would be, um, that they'd be, they don't deny anything, right?
[16:16.880 --> 16:22.980]  Because then they'd be giving it away if there was another subsequent one that was real,
[16:22.980 --> 16:29.000]  but was still pending and then they didn't comment on that one, then it would be a sign
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.200]  that if it's not true, Apple will deny it.
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.360]  But if it is true, they'll be quiet where, so therefore if they want to maintain, you
[16:38.360 --> 16:43.340]  know, keep people in, in, up in the air until they actually make the announcement themselves,
[16:43.340 --> 16:46.260]  they have to not comment on everything, whether it's true or false.
[16:46.260 --> 16:47.640]  So there's some logic there.
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.000]  But I do think though that if it weren't the case, they, I don't think they would address
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.580]  it officially with an official statement, but I think behind the scenes they get word
[16:56.580 --> 16:59.760]  out and we haven't, I haven't seen any sign of that.
[16:59.760 --> 17:06.380]  There's not a single report from anybody saying, uh, you know, unnamed sources familiar with
[17:06.380 --> 17:10.040]  the situation say that Apple is not buying beats.
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.480]  Everything has said, you know, indicates that they, that they still intend to.
[17:14.480 --> 17:22.680]  And uh, Peter Kafka of Recode, that's like the new all things D. Um, he said like mid
[17:22.680 --> 17:28.560]  week last week that it was taking longer than expected, but that this is the week sometime
[17:28.560 --> 17:33.440]  this week it'll be announced, I guess.
[17:33.440 --> 17:36.920]  I can't, it seems like that video probably didn't help.
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.960]  No, I would guess that that video did not help.
[17:40.960 --> 17:43.560]  That probably wasn't a bright idea.
[17:43.560 --> 17:44.560]  You would think so.
[17:44.560 --> 17:53.680]  I just, uh, my guess is it's not the video that was the problem.
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.120]  It's the fact that the video, that's probably not the right, the major, the major problem,
[17:58.120 --> 17:59.120]  right?
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.120]  It was probably jumping the gun.
[18:00.120 --> 18:01.280]  Yeah.
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.360]  And I would guess that dr Dray did not expect it to be posted to Facebook.
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.640]  You know, I got, he, you know what I mean?
[18:08.640 --> 18:10.800]  He's very, very smart man.
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.340]  Uh, and he's clearly been, uh, if it's true, he's clearly been in, he knows enough that
[18:17.340 --> 18:19.440]  apple doesn't want anything announced.
[18:19.440 --> 18:22.720]  I think that the, you know, it was the fact that it was his friend that wasn't that he
[18:22.720 --> 18:23.720]  posted it to Facebook.
[18:23.720 --> 18:26.120]  It was his friend that posted it to Facebook.
[18:26.120 --> 18:33.160]  I bet that was a good conversation because it was only up for a few hours and then it
[18:33.160 --> 18:36.640]  was taken down early in the morning.
[18:36.640 --> 18:40.480]  And it also seemed like the sort of situation where maybe he wouldn't have been getting
[18:40.480 --> 18:46.560]  up early in the morning, right?
[18:46.560 --> 18:48.440]  That would probably be my guess as well.
[18:48.440 --> 18:49.440]  Yeah.
[18:49.440 --> 18:52.200]  There might've been a little sleeping in done after that video was made.
[18:52.200 --> 18:53.200]  No.
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.640]  And I pass no judgment there.
[18:54.640 --> 18:59.080]  Nobody loves to sleep in more than I do.
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.640]  You sure can't swing a pair of Beats headphones around without hitting somebody with an opinion
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.640]  about it though.
[19:04.640 --> 19:05.640]  Yeah.
[19:05.640 --> 19:06.640]  Yeah.
[19:06.640 --> 19:09.600]  I think the funny thing is, I think that's, it's to me, the interesting thing about it
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.360]  isn't the actual, it's no longer the actual acquisition.
[19:12.360 --> 19:18.760]  If it comes to pass, it's more that the way that we've had like this two week period where
[19:18.760 --> 19:27.120]  it was just a unconfirmed rumor with no explanation from Apple or beats as to why Apple would
[19:27.120 --> 19:28.400]  want to do this.
[19:28.400 --> 19:33.760]  It's become like this sort of blank canvas where everybody can project whatever they
[19:33.760 --> 19:38.800]  think about Apple onto it, right?
[19:38.800 --> 19:39.800]  Food or bad.
[19:39.800 --> 19:40.800]  Yeah.
[19:40.800 --> 19:41.800]  Yeah.
[19:41.800 --> 19:42.800]  I guess.
[19:42.800 --> 19:46.160]  I think, I think everything, I mean, I think everything that Apple does has that has that
[19:46.160 --> 19:47.160]  element to it.
[19:47.160 --> 19:48.160]  Yeah.
[19:48.160 --> 19:52.080]  And I feel, but I feel like this more so than anything else because we, it did seem to come
[19:52.080 --> 19:53.520]  out of left field.
[19:53.520 --> 19:57.060]  Like nobody was really predicting it.
[19:57.060 --> 20:01.440]  It did seem confusing at first to a lot of us, to me at least.
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.360]  And I think it's still, I think it's still confusing a little bit anyway because it doesn't
[20:05.360 --> 20:06.720]  seem like the hardware is that great.
[20:06.720 --> 20:12.160]  It doesn't seem like, you know, I mean like they have a streaming service already.
[20:12.160 --> 20:18.400]  And from what everybody says, it doesn't seem like the licenses for the music go along with
[20:18.400 --> 20:19.400]  the sale.
[20:19.400 --> 20:20.400]  Right.
[20:20.400 --> 20:28.160]  But then there's, I have vine, but 3 billion seems like a lot for an aqua hire.
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.160]  Right.
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.160]  Exactly.
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.160]  Right.
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.160]  I don't, you know, maybe altogether though.
[20:32.160 --> 20:34.640]  Maybe, you know, maybe altogether, it seems like something a little bit here, a little
[20:34.640 --> 20:35.640]  bit there.
[20:35.640 --> 20:41.560]  So it's not, you know, on the surface, it's not completely clear exactly what the value
[20:41.560 --> 20:42.560]  is.
[20:42.560 --> 20:44.520]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[20:44.520 --> 20:50.360]  But I don't know though that it, you know, I'm, I'm willing to say as somebody who has,
[20:50.360 --> 20:58.520]  you know, I think widely known as a keen Apple observer, I'm willing to say, I just don't
[20:58.520 --> 20:59.640]  know.
[20:59.640 --> 21:04.000]  And let me just wait and I'll just wait, you know, I don't have, there's no way that I
[21:04.000 --> 21:12.440]  could go off on any kind of strongly opinionated, um, you know, column or, or rant here on the
[21:12.440 --> 21:17.080]  show one way or the other that this is stupid or it's genius either way.
[21:17.080 --> 21:18.080]  I don't know.
[21:18.080 --> 21:19.080]  Cause I don't know enough yet.
[21:19.080 --> 21:21.800]  I don't know why more people can't just say, I don't know.
[21:21.800 --> 21:22.800]  Right.
[21:22.800 --> 21:26.200]  They think that's a sign of weakness, I guess.
[21:26.200 --> 21:30.680]  I don't know, but I've seen people, you know, saying that this is the clearest sign.
[21:30.680 --> 21:36.960]  This is, you know, incontrovertible proof that, uh, Tim Cook is a moron, you know, that
[21:36.960 --> 21:40.520]  he's running the country into the company, into the ground.
[21:40.520 --> 21:45.700]  Um, and I've seen other people say it's genius, you know, and this, you know, keeps Apple
[21:45.700 --> 21:48.040]  on top of the music industry for another two decades.
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.040]  And it's like, really?
[21:49.040 --> 21:54.200]  I don't see how either of those extremes is evident in the least.
[21:54.200 --> 21:55.200]  Yeah.
[21:55.200 --> 21:57.200]  Uh, Sean, did you read a Jean-Louis gases?
[21:57.200 --> 21:59.560]  No, I did not.
[21:59.560 --> 22:01.040]  He's got a, yeah, he's got a piece up today.
[22:01.040 --> 22:07.360]  His Monday note is about, is about that and his, I mean, and he kind of splits it fairly
[22:07.360 --> 22:13.360]  well, basically just saying that he doesn't, he doesn't understand it at this point.
[22:13.360 --> 22:14.360]  Right?
[22:14.360 --> 22:15.360]  Yeah.
[22:15.360 --> 22:20.120]  I think that's the, to me, that's the only thinking man's take is, and it doesn't make
[22:20.120 --> 22:21.120]  it less intriguing.
[22:21.120 --> 22:24.560]  If anything, it makes it more intriguing because it's like, wow, now we, you know, there's
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.520]  something interesting going on here.
[22:26.520 --> 22:28.640]  I can't wait to find out more about it.
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.900]  There's gotta be, you just feel like there's gotta be something more, you know, like, I
[22:33.900 --> 22:42.440]  don't think I really, really, really do not think that the, the answer is, uh, Apple has
[22:42.440 --> 22:47.040]  just given up and decided to just be lazy and just throw billions around willy nilly
[22:47.040 --> 22:49.300]  without really thinking about it.
[22:49.300 --> 22:57.280]  That after going decades only making relatively small, I mean, um, I think it's the case that
[22:57.280 --> 23:02.520]  they haven't made a billion, they've never made a billion dollar acquisition.
[23:02.520 --> 23:08.440]  Um, and then all of a sudden now after never having done so now they're just going to spend
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.440]  money willy nilly.
[23:09.440 --> 23:15.760]  I mean, that doesn't, I, it just doesn't make sense to me, like, like without a very, very
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.160]  concrete idea of how it's going to help Apple.
[23:19.160 --> 23:22.260]  I just don't see it though.
[23:22.260 --> 23:25.640]  It's interesting that when they acquired next, I mean, next was only like 400 million or
[23:25.640 --> 23:26.640]  something like that.
[23:26.640 --> 23:33.440]  400 and some, and there's some inflation adjustment that you have to do, right, right.
[23:33.440 --> 23:38.080]  But there's also, I mean, and I think there's just a, apart from the value of the dollar,
[23:38.080 --> 23:43.560]  there's, there's an acquisition inflation that's gone on since then.
[23:43.560 --> 23:46.360]  I mean, some of these acquisitions that have happened have just driven up.
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.320]  It's like every time somebody wants to get acquired, they're like, well, you know, the
[23:52.320 --> 23:56.000]  Facebook bought Instagram for,
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  well look at it this way.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.360]  The Apple, the Apple and the Apple next acquisition was, I forget when it was officially completed.
[24:04.360 --> 24:11.980]  I think it was like at least a handshake around Christmas, 1996, but, but made official in
[24:11.980 --> 24:14.180]  January 97.
[24:14.180 --> 24:19.520]  So whether you want to call it 96 or 97, probably 97 is a little bit better because it's, you
[24:19.520 --> 24:25.880]  know, you know, Christmas week or new year's week, 96 is effectively 97 anyway.
[24:25.880 --> 24:32.120]  But even so, the, the.com bubble was still in the early days, you know, it's, it had
[24:32.120 --> 24:34.460]  gotten started, but it was still early days.
[24:34.460 --> 24:43.560]  And so I think at that point, acquisitions were still largely done on traditional metrics
[24:43.560 --> 24:46.360]  of revenue, revenue and profit.
[24:46.360 --> 24:52.280]  Like the idea that you would value an acquisition on anything.
[24:52.280 --> 25:00.360]  Well, it's sad in a lot of cases, but in others, maybe not so, you know, like a good example
[25:00.360 --> 25:06.840]  might be Facebook buying Instagram where Instagram hadn't tried to make a nickel, right?
[25:06.840 --> 25:11.960]  They'd never sold the app they'd, they'd never done was clearly worth a lot, right?
[25:11.960 --> 25:16.640]  Because they had growth and they had, you know, all of these images they had even at
[25:16.640 --> 25:17.900]  good technology.
[25:17.900 --> 25:23.140]  Like one thing that to me often goes on unsaid about Instagram because it's when things work,
[25:23.140 --> 25:25.720]  we just don't notice it and we take it for granted.
[25:25.720 --> 25:33.280]  But Twitter, which was all just text, you know, had so many problems with scaling with
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.460]  the fail whale, etc.
[25:37.460 --> 25:41.840]  Instagram was doing something, you know, where I'm guessing the average Instagram post is
[25:41.840 --> 25:47.000]  at least I don't know, I could be, there's gotta be at least 1000 times bigger than a
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.120]  tweet though, because it's an image, not a, not just 140 characters, right?
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.120]  I don't know.
[25:55.120 --> 25:57.120]  I might, but it could be 10,000 times more.
[25:57.120 --> 25:58.120]  I don't even know.
[25:58.120 --> 26:04.040]  I don't even know how big an Instagram image, but it's gotta be at least 1000 times more
[26:04.040 --> 26:06.040]  and never really had scaling problems.
[26:06.040 --> 26:07.040]  Right.
[26:07.040 --> 26:14.480]  And the previous darling of social photo sharing flicker now that we have to go way back in
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.600]  the day for the early days of flicker before Yahoo bought them also had, you know, terrible
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.040]  scaling problems and it was far smaller than Instagram was.
[26:25.040 --> 26:26.040]  They did a great job.
[26:26.040 --> 26:28.720]  So there's some value there, but billions or what was it?
[26:28.720 --> 26:31.520]  1 billion that Facebook bought them for?
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.680]  I think so.
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.160]  For a company that never even tried to make a nickel.
[26:36.160 --> 26:37.160]  It's crazy.
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.760]  Well, not crazy, but it's, it's, it would certainly be crazy if they had a lot of users,
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.520]  which is a pretty important metric for, for that kind of thing.
[26:45.520 --> 26:48.440]  And the potential to make money is there.
[26:48.440 --> 26:51.600]  Yeah, right.
[26:51.600 --> 26:56.240]  I think the biggest thing, if you're going to compare something like Apple buying beats
[26:56.240 --> 27:05.600]  for 3 billion today to Apple's next acquisition in 97 isn't about the, the inflationary difference
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.560]  between 400 and some million then and 3 billion now.
[27:09.560 --> 27:16.120]  It's really more, how much is the cost compared to how much the Apple had on hand at the time?
[27:16.120 --> 27:23.840]  Whereas now Apple has what, like 160 billion in cash, much of it off sea overseas.
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.000]  But even so, even if you, even if they decided to pay the entire price in cash using overseas
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.600]  cash and pay, you know, 30 or 40% income tax on the thing, it's, it's a drop in the bucket,
[27:36.600 --> 27:37.600]  right?
[27:37.600 --> 27:45.520]  It's 5 billion on beats, and it's only 1 35th of their entire cash on hand, you know, right.
[27:45.520 --> 27:53.520]  It's a, you know, whereas the 400 and some million acquisition of next in 1997 was, people
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.080]  say this all the time, that it's a bet the company move that that is one case where it's
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.500]  not the least bit hyperbolic, where it was enough, you know, Apple was near bankruptcy,
[28:02.500 --> 28:06.960]  they didn't have, they couldn't afford to lose to not have it work out.
[28:06.960 --> 28:07.960]  Right.
[28:07.960 --> 28:09.400]  If you're with us, basically.
[28:09.400 --> 28:14.400]  So yeah, so Microsoft's investment was Microsoft 150 million, right?
[28:14.400 --> 28:15.400]  150 million.
[28:15.400 --> 28:16.400]  Yeah.
[28:16.400 --> 28:18.400]  So it was three times a third.
[28:18.400 --> 28:19.400]  Yeah.
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.400]  I'm assuming.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.400]  So Microsoft basically paid for a third of that.
[28:23.400 --> 28:27.420]  I've said this before, Microsoft's people often look back at that and say that Microsoft
[28:27.420 --> 28:32.760]  helped save Apple by giving them 150 million, the 150 million they gave Apple didn't really
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.400]  make much of a difference compared, you know, in terms of keeping the company afloat, like
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  right.
[28:37.400 --> 28:38.400]  They needed office.
[28:38.400 --> 28:43.080]  Yeah, they still needed billions of revenue per quarter, just to stay in the black.
[28:43.080 --> 28:45.440]  So 150 million investment from Microsoft.
[28:45.440 --> 28:49.920]  I mean, it was enough at the time that it certainly didn't hurt, but it didn't really
[28:49.920 --> 28:50.920]  make a big difference.
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.280]  I mean, they needed billions in revenue, and to keep costs down to stay in the black quarter
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.280]  to quarter.
[28:56.280 --> 29:02.480]  It was the, like you said, yeah, the commitment to keep doing office and the political value
[29:02.480 --> 29:05.240]  of the $150 million investment.
[29:05.240 --> 29:06.240]  Yeah.
[29:06.240 --> 29:13.920]  And the fact that it's Apple's revenue last quarter was 45.6 billion.
[29:13.920 --> 29:18.320]  So you know, considering that they take in that about that, and that's no, it wasn't
[29:18.320 --> 29:22.520]  even a record quarter.
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.740]  Three million does not, three billion does not seem like very much, right?
[29:26.740 --> 29:30.000]  I think that the concern, and I have this concern.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  I do.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.600]  I mean, I, you know, I want to see how it turns out.
[29:32.600 --> 29:39.640]  I mean, but as a company watcher, I'm certainly concerned about it where it's not the money.
[29:39.640 --> 29:46.240]  It's to me the potential that it could signify a lack of focus.
[29:46.240 --> 29:52.440]  You know, that focus has always been the key to Apple's success.
[29:52.440 --> 29:59.640]  That they have all of this talent in the company, and so many good executives, and the whole
[29:59.640 --> 30:04.360]  operation is working on such a relatively few number of products.
[30:04.360 --> 30:09.960]  You know, Tim Cook has said, he's used the analogy several times, but that like, you
[30:09.960 --> 30:16.200]  know, that he could put all of the company's products on one table in an Apple store.
[30:16.200 --> 30:21.920]  The entire lineup of hardware that Apple sells could be arranged neatly on one table, and
[30:21.920 --> 30:27.880]  that that sort of focus is what lets the company do such good work on those products.
[30:27.880 --> 30:36.000]  Yeah, and I guess that that kind of colors how you think this deal is the value of this
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.220]  deal, depending on whether you think that they're going to sort of subsume that brand
[30:39.220 --> 30:42.160]  into their own or keep it separate.
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.160]  Yeah, totally.
[30:43.160 --> 30:46.160]  I mean, Montero and I talked about this last week.
[30:46.160 --> 30:47.160]  I just don't know.
[30:47.160 --> 30:52.080]  To me, that's the one of the single biggest questions about this potential acquisition
[30:52.080 --> 31:00.920]  is, and it's fascinating to me, because on the one hand, I can't see Apple having, owning
[31:00.920 --> 31:08.800]  a sub brand, and on the other hand, I can't see spending $3 billion for Beats and not
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.960]  keeping the brand, because to me, it seems to me like most of the value in Beats is in
[31:13.960 --> 31:14.960]  the brand.
[31:14.960 --> 31:20.960]  Yeah, I would guess so, like, again, again, we're just right.
[31:20.960 --> 31:26.400]  I have heard from some people, I mean, clearly among audio files, you know, like your Marco
[31:26.400 --> 31:34.080]  Arments, people who really know what they have seemingly have fully operational ears
[31:34.080 --> 31:37.800]  and really can tell the difference between different headphones.
[31:37.800 --> 31:42.640]  Beats is like a non entity and almost treated with disdain.
[31:42.640 --> 31:47.040]  But I've seen other people say, well, so audio files will keep buying their audio file headphones,
[31:47.040 --> 31:51.320]  you know, from Sennheiser and whoever else.
[31:51.320 --> 31:56.280]  But normal people love the way Beats headphones sound.
[31:56.280 --> 32:01.960]  And that it's not about like, fidelity and reproducing music, you know, in some sort
[32:01.960 --> 32:07.520]  of way that you measure fidelity, but effectively making it sound as though you have a nightclub
[32:07.520 --> 32:10.560]  in your head.
[32:10.560 --> 32:12.400]  And that they do a really good job of that.
[32:12.400 --> 32:16.720]  I don't know, though, that that means that it would be hard for a competitor to do the
[32:16.720 --> 32:20.280]  same thing, though, that they, you know, that they have technology that is it that they
[32:20.280 --> 32:25.520]  have technology that's hard to reproduce or, you know, I don't think that's like that.
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.240]  No, it doesn't seem like it's in particularly since their stuff was made by monster before.
[32:29.240 --> 32:30.240]  Right.
[32:30.240 --> 32:35.920]  I mean, they've only been making their own stuff for a little while six, six months or
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.920]  something.
[32:36.920 --> 32:38.240]  Yeah, maybe a little longer than that.
[32:38.240 --> 32:41.320]  But I've also seen other people and this is on Twitter.
[32:41.320 --> 32:46.240]  And you know, it's all you know, this has been the knock against Apple for as long as
[32:46.240 --> 32:47.240]  Apple has existed.
[32:47.240 --> 32:52.280]  I mean, probably from like 1980 onwards.
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.720]  People who are clearly not a fan of Apple products in general saying it's a perfect
[32:55.720 --> 33:02.600]  acquisition for Apple overpriced technology sold based on marketing alone.
[33:02.600 --> 33:06.640]  So it's a you know, I don't think it's a problem for Apple that from among some people,
[33:06.640 --> 33:11.140]  the idea that Apple buys beats reinforces that notion of the company because I feel
[33:11.140 --> 33:14.520]  like those people there's nothing Apple could ever do in a million years to turn them
[33:14.520 --> 33:15.520]  around.
[33:15.520 --> 33:23.080]  You know, and if your goal is to get 100% of all consumers to view your brand favorably,
[33:23.080 --> 33:24.080]  you're doomed.
[33:24.080 --> 33:28.480]  You're never you're going to end up, you know, you're going to end up failing.
[33:28.480 --> 33:31.880]  Yeah, there's no brand in any market that works like that.
[33:31.880 --> 33:36.120]  So what other what other acquisitions Well, let's take a break.
[33:36.120 --> 33:37.760]  Okay.
[33:37.760 --> 33:43.100]  And let me tell you about our first sponsor, our good friends, all three sponsors today,
[33:43.100 --> 33:44.100]  longtime friends of the show.
[33:44.100 --> 33:50.040]  Glad to have them on board with the transition to the new daring fireball version of the
[33:50.040 --> 33:52.040]  talk show.
[33:52.040 --> 33:55.000]  Our first is our good friends at igloo.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.880]  That's the intranet you'll actually like igloo.
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.880]  And they want me to tell you a little bit about their comparison to SharePoint.
[34:06.880 --> 34:11.240]  Now SharePoint is an intranet product from a little company in my Washington state of
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.080]  Washington up by you, Microsoft.
[34:13.080 --> 34:14.480]  That's correct.
[34:14.480 --> 34:15.480]  Just up the road.
[34:15.480 --> 34:22.640]  If you go to the URL, I'm going to tell you in a minute, which is igloo software.com slash
[34:22.640 --> 34:27.960]  the talk show, you will go to a special page they've set up just for listeners of the show
[34:27.960 --> 34:34.400]  where they show the results of a white paper that they commissioned from a company called
[34:34.400 --> 34:35.400]  Osterman research.
[34:35.400 --> 34:38.760]  They said, Hey, you guys go out there, we're paying you but go out there and do an honest
[34:38.760 --> 34:41.520]  version where you compare our product to SharePoint.
[34:41.520 --> 34:46.000]  And then we're going to share the information with people.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.600]  And they came out ahead and just about every way you could imagine.
[34:49.600 --> 34:50.920]  SharePoint is too expensive.
[34:50.920 --> 34:54.400]  You can save a ton of money by going with igloo.
[34:54.400 --> 34:57.780]  SharePoint requires too many resources, you have to host it yourself, you have to pay
[34:57.780 --> 35:03.080]  for these windows servers, igloo is fully hosted, you don't have to worry about it.
[35:03.080 --> 35:05.860]  People actually this is the big one, people actually use it.
[35:05.860 --> 35:09.920]  What they found is that companies that use SharePoint based intranets, what the employees
[35:09.920 --> 35:15.920]  actually do is spend all their time going around it and using email and avoiding it.
[35:15.920 --> 35:21.120]  Whereas companies that use igloo, people actually will use it and they like it.
[35:21.120 --> 35:24.520]  And I'm laughing because I used to work someplace they use SharePoint.
[35:24.520 --> 35:29.720]  And that is exactly what what we found, right, you install it, and then people find ways
[35:29.720 --> 35:32.400]  to get it get away from it.
[35:32.400 --> 35:34.400]  SharePoint doesn't play well with mobile.
[35:34.400 --> 35:36.680]  That's a huge thing going forward.
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.480]  You know, igloo, everything they do, it has responsive layout, so it's all works great
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.240]  from your phone, whether you're on Android, whether you're on iOS.
[35:45.240 --> 35:50.200]  So they have a thing you can download, just go to igloosoftware.com slash the talk show,
[35:50.200 --> 35:54.100]  they have an evaluation kit you can download.
[35:54.100 --> 35:56.240]  They also have some new templates they've set up.
[35:56.240 --> 35:59.480]  These are pretty recent, these came out like last month.
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.800]  But templates you can use in igloo to set up igloo in different ways, depending on what
[36:03.800 --> 36:10.000]  you need, like if you need a customer community site, or a corporate intranet, just for your
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.660]  team to share two very different use cases, whether you're, you know, setting up something
[36:13.660 --> 36:17.680]  for a community of your users, people who are outside the company or something internal
[36:17.680 --> 36:19.640]  only.
[36:19.640 --> 36:26.800]  They have an app based social network, a couple of new templates, all of them, you can start
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.360]  using for free with up to 10 people just to try it out.
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.940]  This is fantastic, because then you you just set it up free, start using it for you get
[36:36.940 --> 36:41.000]  10 people on board, you don't have to pay anything and make sure that it works just
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.440]  the way you want that it actually is all these things I've just been telling you are true.
[36:45.440 --> 36:48.460]  Only then do you need to sign up when you add more than 10 people.
[36:48.460 --> 36:52.300]  And after that, the price is really, really competitive.
[36:52.300 --> 36:53.300]  So my thanks to them.
[36:53.300 --> 36:59.980]  And again, just go to igloo software.com slash the talk show.
[36:59.980 --> 37:01.320]  What we're talking about acquisitions.
[37:01.320 --> 37:07.960]  So what I positions there's Oh, this is good.
[37:07.960 --> 37:09.460]  This is why I thought about having you on the show.
[37:09.460 --> 37:16.200]  So it's again rumored not completed as we record but YouTube is supposedly buying Twitch
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.540]  Twitch for a billion dollars.
[37:19.540 --> 37:22.100]  So there's two interesting things about that.
[37:22.100 --> 37:27.340]  One Twitch is is effectively I saw I just posted a thing before I did we started recording
[37:27.340 --> 37:32.260]  that it's it's like the ESPN of video games that they stream, right?
[37:32.260 --> 37:35.820]  They treat video games the way ESPN treats sports and you go to Twitch and you use Twitch
[37:35.820 --> 37:40.540]  and you can watch you know, top players play video games.
[37:40.540 --> 37:44.780]  And you and I have talked about this because our sons are 10 years old are really into
[37:44.780 --> 37:49.340]  watching videos of people playing video games.
[37:49.340 --> 37:52.980]  And you know, I didn't come up with this last time we talked about it but you know, I've
[37:52.980 --> 37:59.900]  already watched this season probably the Yankees have played 42 games so far.
[37:59.900 --> 38:02.180]  I've probably watched about 30 of them.
[38:02.180 --> 38:09.180]  So I'm probably up close to 100 hours of baseball that I've watched so far this year.
[38:09.180 --> 38:13.860]  And yet I'm the one who was thinking just just like a month ago, how crazy it is that
[38:13.860 --> 38:18.380]  my son watches people playing game video of people playing games rather than playing them
[38:18.380 --> 38:24.300]  himself whereas I haven't played baseball for 15 years and watch hundreds of hours over
[38:24.300 --> 38:25.300]  the year.
[38:25.300 --> 38:28.300]  And it just hit me like a ton of bricks like, duh, it's the same thing.
[38:28.300 --> 38:29.580]  You know, I'm into baseball.
[38:29.580 --> 38:32.860]  So I love watching my favorite baseball team play.
[38:32.860 --> 38:33.860]  He's into video games.
[38:33.860 --> 38:37.520]  And so he loves watching people play video games.
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.300]  And I would rather watch people play video games because I have a better chance than
[38:41.300 --> 38:49.980]  with my local sports team, I have a better chance seeing somebody actually win.
[38:49.980 --> 38:57.840]  So I think that maybe not if you're if you're YouTube, Google, YouTube, that makes a lot
[38:57.840 --> 38:58.840]  of sense.
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.660]  I also think it's interesting that it's being dealt with as a YouTube acquisition, not a
[39:03.660 --> 39:04.660]  Google acquisition.
[39:04.660 --> 39:05.660]  That was interesting, too.
[39:05.660 --> 39:06.660]  Yeah.
[39:06.660 --> 39:07.660]  And I didn't even notice this.
[39:07.660 --> 39:10.860]  But like the head of YouTube is her title is CEO.
[39:10.860 --> 39:12.500]  Like their YouTube.
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.500]  I didn't know that.
[39:13.500 --> 39:16.580]  I just thought because they were trying to get the same unified sign in everywhere.
[39:16.580 --> 39:21.220]  I didn't realize that YouTube is, you know, as independent as it seems to be.
[39:21.220 --> 39:23.060]  That's interesting.
[39:23.060 --> 39:26.860]  But it totally makes sense to be, you know, for it to, you know, it does make sense that
[39:26.860 --> 39:31.660]  it's YouTube in particular, not Google in general that might be making this acquisition.
[39:31.660 --> 39:35.860]  Yeah, somebody and I apologize because I don't remember it was a retweet of someone who I
[39:35.860 --> 39:42.300]  don't follow, but said that a while ago, Vimeo had noticed that that people were posting
[39:42.300 --> 39:49.140]  a lot of sort of the sort of let's play videos and and responded by banning them.
[39:49.140 --> 39:57.020]  Which, I mean, I guess, you know, if that's what you want for your platform and want that
[39:57.020 --> 40:00.980]  kind of thing on your I mean, they're they're a little more artsy, I guess.
[40:00.980 --> 40:01.980]  Yeah.
[40:01.980 --> 40:05.900]  I mean, you know, they've yeah, they've always sort of differentiated themselves from YouTube
[40:05.900 --> 40:12.100]  or YouTube has sort of been like anything that you can legally post as video.
[40:12.100 --> 40:19.020]  You can post to YouTube where, you know, I mean, you know, the copyright stuff in particular
[40:19.020 --> 40:23.340]  and I'm sure that there's some kind of content based stuff that that would get rejected from
[40:23.340 --> 40:24.380]  YouTube.
[40:24.380 --> 40:26.900]  But if it's legal, you can post it and they don't care what it is.
[40:26.900 --> 40:27.900]  Right.
[40:27.900 --> 40:31.580]  I mean, you can just you know, it's Yeah, I'm sure they actually are often I mean, and
[40:31.580 --> 40:34.500]  they basically usually it seems like they usually wait for someone to ask to have it
[40:34.500 --> 40:35.500]  taken down.
[40:35.500 --> 40:36.500]  Right.
[40:36.500 --> 40:38.540]  Whereas Vimeo is always sort of Yeah, exactly.
[40:38.540 --> 40:42.260]  They sort of want a sort of artistic style.
[40:42.260 --> 40:43.260]  I don't know.
[40:43.260 --> 40:47.460]  And they also have restrictions about commercials type stuff, you know, where you can't.
[40:47.460 --> 40:52.700]  So I didn't I didn't think about that the licensing aspect of it, which maybe maybe
[40:52.700 --> 40:57.180]  that is more of what it is rather than sort of the artsy aspect of it.
[40:57.180 --> 40:58.180]  Yeah.
[40:58.180 --> 41:06.700]  I thought it was more like, we don't we don't want let's play videos on our site.
[41:06.700 --> 41:10.340]  I did see somebody tweeted that one of the things people who are fans of Twitter concerned
[41:10.340 --> 41:14.340]  about with the YouTube acquisition is that a lot of these videos get posted with music
[41:14.340 --> 41:16.740]  playing in the background.
[41:16.740 --> 41:22.700]  You know, and YouTube has gotten very, very good at flagging such things identifying right
[41:22.700 --> 41:23.740]  copyright music.
[41:23.740 --> 41:29.180]  But to me, that's sort of a, you know, and, you know, I'm not a big fan of Google, I
[41:29.180 --> 41:32.980]  think it's fair to say, but I have to say that if you're putting copyright music in
[41:32.980 --> 41:39.740]  your videos and uploading them to a commercial website, and it gets flagged, it's on you.
[41:39.740 --> 41:43.740]  Yeah, there's sort of, you know, the world's tiniest violin playing a sad song here for
[41:43.740 --> 41:44.740]  you.
[41:44.740 --> 41:47.980]  It's like, you know, I understand that it's it in if, you know, it's one of those things
[41:47.980 --> 41:55.100]  like comics ology going to Amazon, where you know, it is making it worse for you as a user.
[41:55.100 --> 42:00.420]  But, you know, come on, you know, copyright stuff is still copying others can't using
[42:00.420 --> 42:04.860]  music for free is still, you have to admit it's a gray area, right?
[42:04.860 --> 42:09.300]  Like you had to, you know, you had to think eventually that that bubble was going to burst
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.740]  one way or the other.
[42:10.740 --> 42:11.740]  Yeah.
[42:11.740 --> 42:16.740]  And I do I think we're on the cusp of this sort of video people.
[42:16.740 --> 42:24.060]  People spend, you know, note and observe observing noting and then monetizing the fact that millions
[42:24.060 --> 42:28.980]  of people are watching hundreds and hundreds of hours of people play video games.
[42:28.980 --> 42:30.180]  That's going to become a thing.
[42:30.180 --> 42:34.500]  It's going to quickly it's not going to take long before idiots like me who think, wow,
[42:34.500 --> 42:39.260]  these crazy kids today, you know, no longer see it as as odd or unusual.
[42:39.260 --> 42:44.320]  Yeah, I think maybe you mentioned this before, but I feel like that's this is kind of my
[42:44.320 --> 42:49.460]  first moment of having something like that come up.
[42:49.460 --> 42:55.220]  I mean, and from kids so young, I mean, kids from, you know, our kids are 10 and seeing
[42:55.220 --> 43:00.740]  what they do and kind of in the beginning going, oh, you know, that's so lowbrow,
[43:00.740 --> 43:02.380]  but then realizing, well, maybe not.
[43:02.380 --> 43:04.860]  Maybe it's maybe I need to give it another chance.
[43:04.860 --> 43:05.860]  Yeah.
[43:05.860 --> 43:08.300]  And I'm sure it's just like any I mean, you know, I feel like I'm almost proud of
[43:08.300 --> 43:15.460]  myself for being as uncommudgeonly as to recognize that this is normal, that this there's not
[43:15.460 --> 43:18.060]  that I shouldn't be seen, that I was wrong, that I shouldn't be seen.
[43:18.060 --> 43:19.060]  This is weird.
[43:19.060 --> 43:22.900]  Yeah, I'm kind of proud of myself.
[43:22.900 --> 43:27.220]  And it wasn't until he started watching that stuff that I even realized that this was such
[43:27.220 --> 43:28.620]  a huge industry.
[43:28.620 --> 43:29.620]  Yeah.
[43:29.620 --> 43:34.220]  Well, you wrote that I wrote that article about the guys are doing Minecraft stuff and
[43:34.220 --> 43:37.220]  they're making ridiculous amounts of money, right?
[43:37.220 --> 43:38.340]  And good for them, right?
[43:38.340 --> 43:39.340]  Yeah.
[43:39.340 --> 43:40.340]  No, it's great.
[43:40.340 --> 43:41.340]  It's great.
[43:41.340 --> 43:43.960]  I mean, because it all comes down to the bottom line is attention.
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.420]  You know, this is not a new observation.
[43:46.420 --> 43:47.420]  It's obvious.
[43:47.420 --> 43:51.900]  But, you know, that's the one thing that we have collectively in the aggregate that's
[43:51.900 --> 43:53.460]  a limited resource.
[43:53.460 --> 43:57.480]  Every person only has 24 hours in the day and we need to spend a certain number of hours
[43:57.480 --> 44:01.480]  of that sleeping and eating and working or going to school or something.
[44:01.480 --> 44:08.980]  So, you know, if you're capturing in the aggregate millions of hours of attention, there's tremendous
[44:08.980 --> 44:09.980]  value there.
[44:09.980 --> 44:10.980]  Yeah.
[44:10.980 --> 44:17.060]  And Stampy Longnose, that guy that are the main guy that I wrote about that article recently
[44:17.060 --> 44:21.220]  tweeted that he's, you know, it was a picture of Jack Black.
[44:21.220 --> 44:24.280]  You know, he was visiting with Jack Black and the two of them are going to be working
[44:24.280 --> 44:25.280]  on something together.
[44:25.280 --> 44:26.280]  That's awesome.
[44:26.280 --> 44:27.280]  Yeah.
[44:27.280 --> 44:29.700]  That's so great.
[44:29.700 --> 44:34.260]  Which is a really, which is a good fit for starters, but also just, I mean, the fact
[44:34.260 --> 44:42.300]  that this guy who was working in a pub two years ago and is now a gigantic mogul of YouTube
[44:42.300 --> 44:43.300]  Minecraft videos.
[44:43.300 --> 44:44.840]  That's so awesome.
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.300]  But that it's all just, you know, of a piece that you're doing this, you know, you're doing
[44:49.300 --> 44:51.500]  this thing that people watch for this reason.
[44:51.500 --> 44:53.420]  I do these things that people watch for another reason.
[44:53.420 --> 44:57.480]  We should do something together, right?
[44:57.480 --> 45:07.100]  What else acquisition news AT&T is buying direct TV for $45 billion.
[45:07.100 --> 45:11.780]  You can just feel the increase in competition, can't you?
[45:11.780 --> 45:13.640]  I was just talking to somebody yesterday.
[45:13.640 --> 45:18.740]  We got together with friends yesterday, out of town friends.
[45:18.740 --> 45:21.160]  And we were talking about that.
[45:21.160 --> 45:27.240]  That's the thing that really greats about Comcast, Time Warner merger, which is really
[45:27.240 --> 45:34.260]  Comcast buying Time Warner, which is for almost the same amount of money, like $46 billion.
[45:34.260 --> 45:39.180]  It would be one thing if Comcast argument was, okay, don't worry, this is still going
[45:39.180 --> 45:41.100]  to be okay for consumers.
[45:41.100 --> 45:43.380]  Here's why that's in.
[45:43.380 --> 45:45.820]  And there's some kind of argument they could make there.
[45:45.820 --> 45:47.060]  And maybe it makes some kind of sense.
[45:47.060 --> 45:52.440]  But the fact that they're actually saying that it will increase competition, it would
[45:52.440 --> 46:01.740]  increase competition for us to consume our largest competitor makes no sense.
[46:01.740 --> 46:07.500]  If the Yankees and Red Sox merged, you could say, well, this would be good for baseball
[46:07.500 --> 46:09.880]  for this reason or the other.
[46:09.880 --> 46:18.660]  But you can't say it would increase competition because it's two arch rivals with big budgets.
[46:18.660 --> 46:22.700]  Direct TV and AT&T merging cannot increase competition.
[46:22.700 --> 46:27.940]  Yeah, it's classic lobbyist talk.
[46:27.940 --> 46:28.940]  Yeah.
[46:28.940 --> 46:35.140]  I also saw that the Direct TV in particular was part of Comcast.
[46:35.140 --> 46:36.540]  I think it's driven.
[46:36.540 --> 46:40.100]  It could be the sort of thing where maybe AT&T wouldn't have done this if they didn't
[46:40.100 --> 46:45.060]  have the nagging feeling that this Comcast Time Warner thing is going to go through.
[46:45.060 --> 46:50.220]  And that they kind of need to get bigger in the same way.
[46:50.220 --> 46:56.620]  But part of Comcast's argument that this is not anti-competitive or bad for consumers
[46:56.620 --> 47:05.560]  in a competitive way is that the average U.S. citizen has at least three options as an alternative
[47:05.560 --> 47:07.580]  to Comcast and Time Warner.
[47:07.580 --> 47:14.360]  But it's not about cable service to your home or any kind of wired thing.
[47:14.360 --> 47:21.100]  It's Direct TV that they're counting as competition, something of an entirely different sort.
[47:21.100 --> 47:23.100]  Just the whole thing.
[47:23.100 --> 47:24.100]  I'd mentioned this before.
[47:24.100 --> 47:30.980]  I'm just glad that here in Tacoma, we have a city provided broadband.
[47:30.980 --> 47:32.900]  Very few cities have done that.
[47:32.900 --> 47:33.900]  Forget who else.
[47:33.900 --> 47:37.380]  I just saw somebody was, was it San Diego?
[47:37.380 --> 47:38.380]  I forget.
[47:38.380 --> 47:44.300]  They're somewhere in Southern California where they have municipal Wi-Fi and that it works
[47:44.300 --> 47:45.300]  well.
[47:45.300 --> 47:46.300]  It's really good.
[47:46.300 --> 47:49.540]  If it's not San Diego, it's somewhere else in Southern California.
[47:49.540 --> 47:55.200]  But you're downtown and you can just walk around and get on the Wi-Fi and you have superior
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.140]  to LTE, wireless internet everywhere.
[48:01.140 --> 48:05.340]  But those pockets are very few and far between.
[48:05.340 --> 48:06.340]  So what do you guys have?
[48:06.340 --> 48:08.340]  You guys have wired broadband?
[48:08.340 --> 48:09.900]  Yep.
[48:09.900 --> 48:11.300]  And who do you pay?
[48:11.300 --> 48:17.260]  We were one of those, like in the late 90s, like one of those cities that was vying for
[48:17.260 --> 48:21.700]  the title of America's most wired city or something like that.
[48:21.700 --> 48:24.420]  But how does it work?
[48:24.420 --> 48:26.140]  They were doing that.
[48:26.140 --> 48:34.900]  So the city runs the network and they have contracted with a few small local private
[48:34.900 --> 48:38.060]  companies to provide the service and come out and do the installation and stuff like
[48:38.060 --> 48:39.060]  that.
[48:39.060 --> 48:40.060]  And there's a good service?
[48:40.060 --> 48:41.060]  Yeah.
[48:41.060 --> 48:42.060]  It's fine.
[48:42.060 --> 48:43.060]  Yeah.
[48:43.060 --> 48:47.060]  I mean, it's certainly no worse than Comcast.
[48:47.060 --> 48:48.060]  That should be their slogan.
[48:48.060 --> 48:50.700]  I feel good that I'm not sending Comcast my money.
[48:50.700 --> 48:52.500]  That should be their slogan.
[48:52.500 --> 48:54.580]  Yeah, right.
[48:54.580 --> 48:56.580]  Certainly no worse than Comcast.
[48:56.580 --> 49:00.900]  I mean, I experience ups and downs.
[49:00.900 --> 49:07.460]  I don't have any idea if I experience more ups and downs than your average Comcast user.
[49:07.460 --> 49:10.820]  And I don't get a lot of them.
[49:10.820 --> 49:14.460]  And I pay for like the cheapest level.
[49:14.460 --> 49:16.420]  So shocker.
[49:16.420 --> 49:19.660]  Yeah.
[49:19.660 --> 49:22.100]  You need that before you ask.
[49:22.100 --> 49:28.180]  Let me take a break here and thank our second sponsor, our good friends at Backblaze.
[49:28.180 --> 49:35.540]  Backblaze is unlimited, unthrottled, uncomplicated backup for your Mac.
[49:35.540 --> 49:44.900]  Multiple anywhere you pay $5 a month per Mac and you get unlimited backup.
[49:44.900 --> 49:47.900]  It sounds too good to be true, but it's not.
[49:47.900 --> 49:48.900]  Makes a lot of sense.
[49:48.900 --> 49:54.460]  Does it take a long time for your initial backload upload of your entire four gigabytes
[49:54.460 --> 49:58.820]  or whatever you have or four terabytes, however big it is to upload?
[49:58.820 --> 50:03.460]  Yeah, it does actually, but you can just do it during your free trial period.
[50:03.460 --> 50:11.620]  And then once your whole Mac is backed up over the cloud to Backblaze's servers, everything
[50:11.620 --> 50:14.620]  else is just incremental after that.
[50:14.620 --> 50:21.540]  And they have iOS apps for your iPhone, for iPad that you can access your data from anywhere
[50:21.540 --> 50:22.740]  at any time.
[50:22.740 --> 50:26.620]  So if you're on your iPhone and there's a file that you know is on your Mac and your
[50:26.620 --> 50:31.040]  whole Mac is backed up to Backblaze, you can just go into Backblaze on your iPhone, go
[50:31.040 --> 50:36.820]  to where that file is on your hard drive, and download it right there to your iPhone
[50:36.820 --> 50:40.100]  from anywhere, anytime.
[50:40.100 --> 50:41.900]  And it's all for just $5 a month.
[50:41.900 --> 50:42.900]  No upgrades.
[50:42.900 --> 50:47.380]  There's no, oh, for, well, there is a $5, $5 a month tier, but it's not really the one
[50:47.380 --> 50:48.380]  you want.
[50:48.380 --> 50:51.180]  You're going to want to upgrade to a bigger thing because you only get so much.
[50:51.180 --> 50:52.180]  No, it's nothing like that.
[50:52.180 --> 50:58.220]  It's just $5 a month for everybody per Mac.
[50:58.220 --> 50:59.220]  Great service.
[50:59.220 --> 51:03.380]  I always say it makes you sleep better knowing you have an offsite backup.
[51:03.380 --> 51:04.380]  I've been using it.
[51:04.380 --> 51:06.820]  I forget how long I've been using it.
[51:06.820 --> 51:09.980]  And it just runs in the background on your Mac.
[51:09.980 --> 51:11.260]  Nothing to worry about.
[51:11.260 --> 51:12.260]  Just a great service.
[51:12.260 --> 51:17.480]  I think it's probably a great thing not just for all of you out here listening to the show,
[51:17.480 --> 51:22.400]  but it's also a great thing that you could set up for your parents or anybody like less
[51:22.400 --> 51:28.800]  technical family and friends members who have Macs so that you know that everything they
[51:28.800 --> 51:34.140]  have is getting backed up off site just in case something bad happens in the house or
[51:34.140 --> 51:38.340]  wherever their Mac is great, great, great service.
[51:38.340 --> 51:42.000]  If you haven't tried it, I just can't imagine what you're waiting for.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  And I don't even know.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.420]  I can't imagine why anybody would try it and then not sign up for it because it's just
[51:46.420 --> 51:48.360]  so great.
[51:48.360 --> 51:51.140]  Where do you go to sign up and find out more easy?
[51:51.140 --> 51:59.960]  You go to their website, www dot back blaze dot com slash daring fireball back blaze dot
[51:59.960 --> 52:03.140]  com slash daring fireball.
[52:03.140 --> 52:05.140]  My thanks to them.
[52:05.140 --> 52:08.460]  I'm going there right now.
[52:08.460 --> 52:11.620]  Yes, just you.
[52:11.620 --> 52:14.220]  But you know, I currently don't have offsite backup.
[52:14.220 --> 52:15.660]  Well, then you're not.
[52:15.660 --> 52:16.660]  Is dumb.
[52:16.660 --> 52:17.660]  Yeah, really dumb.
[52:17.660 --> 52:21.620]  You should start it, start it right now while we're recording the show over Skype, because
[52:21.620 --> 52:28.540]  I'm sure that won't cause anything whatsoever until we're done.
[52:28.540 --> 52:35.380]  My thanks to backblaze for ruining this recording of the talk.
[52:35.380 --> 52:36.780]  I already ruined it.
[52:36.780 --> 52:40.340]  I tell you, it does put perspective on it where if you want, you know, Apple, the company
[52:40.340 --> 52:47.380]  with 160 billion in the bank is buying a company for $3 billion and it was mega, mega news
[52:47.380 --> 52:50.220]  for, you know, a week and a half.
[52:50.220 --> 52:54.660]  If assuming it comes to fruition this week, I'm sure it'll pop, pop back up to the top
[52:54.660 --> 53:05.180]  of the tech news was at one 15th the size of AT&T's purchase of DirecTV.
[53:05.180 --> 53:10.940]  Do you think that they would wait until WWDC I thought of that, you know, they're close
[53:10.940 --> 53:15.380]  enough now because what we're as we record today, we're two weeks to the day we're recording
[53:15.380 --> 53:16.740]  on Monday the 19th.
[53:16.740 --> 53:18.060]  So we're two weeks to the day.
[53:18.060 --> 53:24.700]  So I don't know why not, you know, it, you know, would, and especially if they have some
[53:24.700 --> 53:30.140]  sort of consumer based story to tell about why they're doing it and what they have planned
[53:30.140 --> 53:31.140]  together.
[53:31.140 --> 53:32.140]  Why not?
[53:32.140 --> 53:37.580]  You know, why not just get all the paperwork ready to go?
[53:37.580 --> 53:40.100]  Don't put the signatures down until Sunday, June 1st.
[53:40.100 --> 53:45.780]  And then, you know, right, Monday, June 2nd, have something, something on the keynote.
[53:45.780 --> 53:47.580]  It's close enough that I wouldn't be surprised.
[53:47.580 --> 53:51.300]  Then you've got instant news, right?
[53:51.300 --> 53:56.340]  Not that anybody's probably not going to write about it anyway, but well, and they get their
[53:56.340 --> 54:02.940]  own, they get to, they get to spin it their way, tell their story, tell their side of
[54:02.940 --> 54:11.980]  the story and explain themselves first in a, in a, in a forum that's more, you know,
[54:11.980 --> 54:15.940]  a richer medium than just a press release.
[54:15.940 --> 54:16.940]  Right.
[54:16.940 --> 54:17.940]  A press release.
[54:17.940 --> 54:18.940]  You just can write what you want to say.
[54:18.940 --> 54:25.300]  Whereas during a WWDC keynote, you can tell it and you can, you know, use, use your voice
[54:25.300 --> 54:30.300]  and, you know, slides and bring Dr. Dre up on stage if you want.
[54:30.300 --> 54:31.300]  I don't know.
[54:31.300 --> 54:32.300]  I don't know.
[54:32.300 --> 54:36.620]  But it, you know, it's, you know, it's the way that, you know, there's something about
[54:36.620 --> 54:42.260]  watching people talk that's different and better than just reading about it, right?
[54:42.260 --> 54:45.940]  The iPhone announcement in 2007 would not have been the iPhone announcement that if
[54:45.940 --> 54:50.140]  it had just come out in a press release with a picture, it's the fact that it was on, on
[54:50.140 --> 54:52.260]  stage with the crowd, right?
[54:52.260 --> 54:53.820]  Stan Sigmund hadn't been there.
[54:53.820 --> 54:54.820]  Exactly.
[54:54.820 --> 54:57.100]  What would we have laughed at?
[54:57.100 --> 55:04.860]  I wonder if anybody else remembers him as fondly as we did.
[55:04.860 --> 55:13.040]  That was, it was, it was, it was just so because that keynote was so amazing.
[55:13.040 --> 55:16.780]  And then we had to sit there for five minutes and listen to Stan Sigmund.
[55:16.780 --> 55:19.900]  Do you know who Stan Sigmund was?
[55:19.900 --> 55:22.660]  Stan Sigmund, is it Sigmund or Stigman?
[55:22.660 --> 55:23.660]  Sigmund.
[55:23.660 --> 55:32.020]  Stan Sigmund was to the iPhone keynote, what Christian Laitner was to the dream team.
[55:32.020 --> 55:36.540]  Do you remember the dream team, the original, the first time the U.S. sent professional
[55:36.540 --> 55:38.940]  basketball players to the Olympics?
[55:38.940 --> 55:43.740]  And it was Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Bart.
[55:43.740 --> 55:48.460]  I mean, it's just, you know, those three, the three at the top are arguably the, I think,
[55:48.460 --> 55:51.740]  well, you know, LeBron's probably up there now, maybe, I don't know.
[55:51.740 --> 55:55.700]  But you know, at the time they were all three were considered arguably the single greatest
[55:55.700 --> 55:57.820]  player of all time.
[55:57.820 --> 56:03.420]  All on the same team, all, you know, almost all, not just all stars, but hall of famers
[56:03.420 --> 56:04.420]  down the line.
[56:04.420 --> 56:09.660]  And then they had, they had room for one college player and it could have been either Shaq
[56:09.660 --> 56:14.580]  who wound up having a fantastic pro career, you know, hall of fame career or Christian
[56:14.580 --> 56:20.060]  Laitner from Duke and they picked Christian Laitner.
[56:20.060 --> 56:25.040]  That was Stan Sigmund.
[56:25.040 --> 56:30.980]  Greatest announcement in the history of consumer electronics.
[56:30.980 --> 56:39.340]  And then at one point, and then it just like stalls in the midst of outright near pandemonium
[56:39.340 --> 56:49.500]  and delirium in the, in the, in the hall, all of a sudden there was narcolepsy.
[56:49.500 --> 56:52.380]  People had to pass the smelling salts out.
[56:52.380 --> 57:01.620]  Yeah, when, when Jerry Yang is up there, Jerry Yang is up there and he's not like the least
[57:01.620 --> 57:03.620]  charismatic speaker.
[57:03.620 --> 57:04.620]  Right.
[57:04.620 --> 57:07.820]  Bring back Jerry Yang.
[57:07.820 --> 57:08.820]  Yeah, right.
[57:08.820 --> 57:11.820]  Put Jerry Yang back up.
[57:11.820 --> 57:15.700]  Breaking news.
[57:15.700 --> 57:30.620]  It has come to our attention that like a dummy, I forgot to mention something that I wanted
[57:30.620 --> 57:36.220]  to during the recording with John Moltz and that is this.
[57:36.220 --> 57:42.080]  For those of you who will be in San Francisco during the week of WWDC, I'm going to have
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.740]  another live audience episode of the talk show.
[57:45.740 --> 57:51.180]  I've done this last two years as we, the third year, it's been a lot of fun and the show
[57:51.180 --> 57:54.140]  should be even better than before.
[57:54.140 --> 57:55.980]  It's going to be on Tuesday.
[57:55.980 --> 58:00.700]  That's June 3rd, 6 to 9 PM at mezzanine in San Francisco.
[58:00.700 --> 58:02.260]  We've already got the venue.
[58:02.260 --> 58:04.880]  I don't have any ticket information yet.
[58:04.880 --> 58:08.400]  Don't have the URL, but I will.
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.560]  So what I'm going to do is rather than announce it on Daring Fireball, I will announce it
[58:13.560 --> 58:18.580]  here on the show in the next episode, not this episode, not the one you're listening
[58:18.580 --> 58:20.140]  to right now.
[58:20.140 --> 58:27.240]  Next episode, episode 82, I will have instructions URL or something like that where you go to
[58:27.240 --> 58:29.180]  buy your tickets for the show.
[58:29.180 --> 58:34.180]  So the first crack at tickets, we should have about 500 available.
[58:34.180 --> 58:38.280]  The first crack will go to the first people who listen to the show.
[58:38.280 --> 58:41.860]  So if you really want to get a ticket, you want to be sure to get one, pay attention.
[58:41.860 --> 58:45.860]  Keep your eyes peeled for the next episode of the talk show, episode 82.
[58:45.860 --> 58:46.860]  Give it a listen.
[58:46.860 --> 58:50.140]  And in that show, you'll find out how to get a ticket.
[58:50.140 --> 58:51.140]  Thanks.
[58:51.140 --> 58:53.540]  Hope to see you there.
[58:53.540 --> 59:01.500]  And now back to the talk show.
[59:01.500 --> 59:07.540]  So WWDC, two weeks, two weeks.
[59:07.540 --> 59:08.720]  Maybe you want to hold off on.
[59:08.720 --> 59:10.940]  You want to hold off on speculation for your next show?
[59:10.940 --> 59:11.940]  Maybe.
[59:11.940 --> 59:15.140]  But, you know, you could ask me questions.
[59:15.140 --> 59:19.480]  I don't know.
[59:19.480 --> 59:20.480]  Big iPhone?
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.480]  I don't think so.
[59:21.480 --> 59:22.480]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[59:22.480 --> 59:23.720]  I got a better I got a better question.
[59:23.720 --> 59:26.860]  Split screen iPad.
[59:26.860 --> 59:29.940]  Yeah.
[59:29.940 --> 59:31.660]  I believe it.
[59:31.660 --> 59:35.420]  I mean, I don't think it's ridiculous.
[59:35.420 --> 59:41.620]  And you know, I trust Mark Gurman, who reported it enough that I don't think that he you know,
[59:41.620 --> 59:47.340]  I think his source probably, you know, is reasonably either in Apple or reasonably could
[59:47.340 --> 59:52.100]  be expected to to know of such a thing.
[59:52.100 --> 59:53.180]  But I don't know.
[59:53.180 --> 59:56.820]  The devil would be in the details in terms of how it's actually how you actually get
[59:56.820 --> 59:59.820]  into and out of this such a mode.
[59:59.820 --> 01:00:05.020]  Yeah, because I think that's been I mean, Microsoft always tells them you can use two
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.060]  apps at the same time.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.300]  But you wouldn't really want to write.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:17.260]  My guess is if it's true, it's something that you manage within the multitasking switcher.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:22.100]  In other words, the thing you get when you double tap the home button, and that you zoom
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:27.460]  out a little bit to like a card type view now in iOS seven you do.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.260]  And it might even help explain why they switched to that card type view where you actually
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:37.580]  see what looks like windows of your apps as you pan left and right.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.700]  And that maybe you could take two of them and push them together.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.700]  Yeah.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.640]  And then, you know, but I don't know, though, it all seems, you know, you start thinking
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.760]  about this, if you actually try to think it through, and, you know, get it detailed down
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.860]  enough that you could actually hand over to someone and say, Okay, build this, it, you
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:02.260]  start seeing how complicated it is, because it almost certainly would require apps to
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.340]  support it explicitly, because the size of the app on screen would be it would be a new
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.380]  size, it would be a new window size, right?
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.980]  Because it's, you know, it's something that would work with.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.180]  If they announced it at WWDC, by definition, it would be part of an announcement of iOS
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.500]  eight, not a part of new iPad hardware.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.980]  So it would have to work on existing iPads.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.940]  And so you could just take the half the size of the iPad screen.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:33.100]  And that's the size that the app would be running in, you know, 10 20 2048.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:42.700]  So it'd be like 1024 by I don't know, whatever it would be, I can't do that math, man, right.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.540]  But it would still be new dimensions and a new size.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.860]  Yeah.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.080]  And it would.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.300]  So you couldn't just push together any two apps, you'd only be able to push together
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.700]  two apps that support it.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.580]  Well, then how do you show the user which ones you can push together?
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.580]  I don't know.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.580]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:09.940]  And he also he is the other thing was he sort of insinuated that it might have implications
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.940]  for?
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:17.340]  Well, he I guess he said this, but for data sharing between different apps.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.820]  On that point, I think he was I think he was guessing, guessing Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.340]  Because I don't think Yeah, it didn't seem like that was, you know, what came from his
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.340]  source.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.740]  It seemed like that was his reference.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:36.460]  Yeah, I don't think it would require the XPC as he said, Yeah, certainly possible.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.820]  But again, I think it would have to be you know, you have to figure out have to see the
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.720]  details of exactly how you get into and out of the mode.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.640]  And I think it has to be the sort of thing where I think the most important thing would
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.820]  be that you can't get into it accidentally, because I think that then all of a sudden
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.700]  you're in it's starting to turn into something like the Mac where people are easily confused.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.060]  And that's so big a part of right, why as a pro, it would be good, it would be great
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.980]  as a pro feature or something that you turn on explicitly, right?
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:10.140]  And you just can't underestimate don't you don't want somebody like my mother or father.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.380]  Right and I that everything's always and I don't play that card lately.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.380]  You know that?
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:22.780]  I know that some people get all incensed about the plane that the non techie tech savvy grandparents
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.780]  card, but it's true.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.260]  No, it's absolutely true.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.200]  I mean, my my parents both have iPads now.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.560]  And I've, in years, I've gotten like one call about like an iPad problem.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:42.360]  And it was really came down to like a billing thing with the cellular wireless, which is
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.440]  you know, sort of a complicated aspect of it, but in terms of just using it, it's never
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]  been a problem.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440]  Whereas I think,
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.940]  I think you and I talked about you didn't you get a call once when somebody was in full
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940]  screen mode?
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940]  Yeah.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:57.940]  I couldn't get out.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940]  Right.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.940]  Exactly.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940]  No, that was exactly true.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:09.860]  Where my my parents had got a new iMac and upgraded jumped a couple versions of Mac OS
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.620]  and never had full screen mode before got into it.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.600]  And it was a confusing phone call because I was in there like, how do you quit?
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.860]  We want to quit mail.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.380]  And I was like, just go up to the menu.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.300]  And they're like, there is no menu.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300]  There's always a menu.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.740]  And then I thought, wait, not when you're in full screen.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.820]  Although I guess if you run the mouse up there, there is a menu but because they couldn't
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.540]  see it in the first place, they never even thought to run the mouse up to see if there
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.540]  was a menu.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.540]  Right?
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.480]  Yeah, full screen can getting into full screen mode accidentally required a phone call.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.660]  And I feel like whatever the iPad does for two apps on the screen at the same time cannot
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.060]  be something that's going to get me a phone call.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:50.740]  Yeah, if I get a phone call about it, then I then Apple is somebody didn't do their job.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:56.540]  And to me, that's more important than number two, which would be making it convenient enough
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.500]  that power users who know what they're doing and who really want to do it can get into
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:07.260]  it easy enough that it's that they end up using.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.260]  I don't know.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:13.900]  It's like there's a lot of people out there who I don't want to call them iPad doubters,
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:19.500]  but you know, people who just generally down on the iPad as like a long term replacement
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:30.560]  for the Mac and productivity device who want more power user type features in iOS, especially
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.180]  on the iPad, maybe compared to the phone, just because it's big enough that you could
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.140]  do stuff like nobody is saying they want two apps on the same time on the iPhone, or at
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.360]  least nobody's saying.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:46.380]  I just feel like those sort of people gloss just gloss over how confusing computers in
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.540]  general are to most people.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:54.740]  It's just if you understand it, and you never really find yourself confused or lost on Mac
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.260]  OS X, you just can't.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.260]  It's just so hard.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.740]  It's the same people who think that widgets on Android are the killer feature.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:07.100]  I saw something this week on ZDNet about how much more quoted I didn't link to it because
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.380]  it was, you know, it's like one of those things like you don't want to draw attention to something.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.380]  Yeah.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.060]  And it wasn't the guy was I think the guy meant it honestly, but he said, Look at how
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:23.580]  do you know how huge the usability advantage of Android is versus iOS usability, he called
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580]  it.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.420]  And it was his his home screen on both devices.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.460]  And he carries both like for work.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:34.980]  For some reason, he has an Android, a galaxy and a iPhone, and his iPhone home screen,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.460]  of course, is just a bunch of apps.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:41.860]  And his Android home screen is a couple of apps and a bunch of widgets, including a bunch
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:47.380]  of like home automation ones, so that he can like, you know, open his garage door and change
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:51.140]  his thermostat and do all this stuff without ever entering an app, but do it right from
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:56.560]  his Android home screen, which is cool in a geeky way.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.740]  It's kind of, you know, and obviously it makes him happy.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.500]  And maybe you know, he's too fiddly.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:05.860]  Yeah, he's a perfect example of a sort of person who truly is better served by Android
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.920]  than I was that guy, that guy, he tries too hard.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.900]  But calling it a user, I know that I know who that is calling it a years, years long
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:20.640]  usability advantages, I think stretching it, I just feel like people vastly underestimate
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.680]  how big of a usability advantage for different people iOS has in terms of never making people
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.180]  feel like they're lost.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.180]  Right?
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.180]  Because what happens?
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:35.980]  You're in two screen mode and you hit the home button, what happens to both apps go
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.660]  away and replace with your home screen?
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.660]  Because that's what I would expect to happen, because whenever I hit the home button, I'm
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:48.460]  taken back to the safety of I'm back to ground zero, just a home screen full of apps.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.460]  You know, there's a perfect solution for that.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]  What's that?
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:57.820]  Two home buttons.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.180]  Hold that thought.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.180]  Hold that thought.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:07.780]  And let me thank our third and final sponsor of the day, our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:13.820]  You guys know Squarespace Squarespace is the all in one hosting system for creating hosting
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.340]  a website.

[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:25.220]  they have all sorts of podcast specific features.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:32.220]  You could host a store, and they have all sorts of great commerce related features.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.500]  They have an award winning, literally award winning, they've won numerous awards for their
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.580]  customer support.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:47.460]  And that's something like 40 5060 support staff in New York, available 24 hours a day,
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:54.340]  seven days a week to help you with any sort of question about getting started about configuring
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.820]  about getting in there.

[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.900]  designed.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.500]  But they give you code level control, if you want to geek out, if you want to tweak stuff,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.500]  if you know what you're doing in terms of CSS, or injecting your own JavaScript or something

[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.780]  Just fantastic, almost an unbelievable amount of stuff to choose from.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.700]  And you only have to use what it is that you want.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:34.980]  Where do you go to find out more and do it in such a way that you came from this show?
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.220]  Easy.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:44.780]  Their code this month, the URL at least is squarespace.com slash Gruber, I think, because
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:48.220]  we were already in contact with them with this switch, so they didn't want to go talk
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.620]  show or during Fireball, it's just slash Gruber.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.340]  Squarespace.com slash Gruber.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:10:00.520]  They also have an offer code when you sign up, and it's just two letters, JG.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:06.460]  So when you sign up, if you use that offer code JG, you get 10% off for the lifetime
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.180]  of your account, you can save tons of money, tons of money, if you're ready to sign up
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:14.660]  for Squarespace, if you use that code JG, my thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring the
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:19.820]  show and their continued support.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.140]  Home button.
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.140]  Two of them.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.140]  Well, here's what I wanted to talk about.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.580]  I'm talking about one home button.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.860]  So I don't know if you noticed this, I tweeted a couple of times about it, but a couple of
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:40.020]  weeks ago, I bought a Firefox phone, the ZTE Open C Firefox OS phone.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:45.260]  I forget what site I was reading, but it said that they started to sell it in the US on
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.260]  eBay.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260]  It's like an eBay store.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.180]  You just go there, $99 smartphone unlocked.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.860]  Oh, of course it's unlocked.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.020]  Of course it's unlocked.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:03.900]  So you just go there and you spend 99 bucks, and a couple of days later, you get your phone.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.580]  I guess I should write about it on Daring Fireball.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.100]  A lot of times I get these things and never end up writing about it.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:14.260]  But long story short, it's not a good phone.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:25.420]  B, one thing I know that is interesting is that they copied conceptually.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.740]  And I don't mean this in a pejorative way at all.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:35.760]  I just mean in terms of, look, they're following years behind the footsteps of the modern smartphone,
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:42.840]  which is a touchscreen device that more or less runs something that's like a real computer
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.740]  operating system, the post-iPhone smartphone.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.700]  And one thing that they got right is there's only one button on the front, a home button.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.380]  There's a button to turn it on.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:00.180]  It's got the exact same buttons as the iPhone, except it doesn't have a mute switch.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.540]  So there's an on-off switch at the top, just like the iPhone, volume up, volume down on
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.180]  the side.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.380]  And then on the front face, underneath the screen, there's just a circle, and that circle
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.380]  is the home button.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:16.100]  And the home button does exactly what the home button on the iPhone does, is it takes
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:21.220]  you to a home screen full of app icons.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:29.540]  So in one sense, I found myself very � for an iPhone user, there's no way to get lost
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:30.540]  or confused.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:35.700]  It's very, very iPhone-like in terms of what's the basic gist of how you use the
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.780]  thing.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:58.220]  I
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:21.300]  was
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:28.580]  better company than Verizon or AT&T, albeit with a smaller network coverage. But it's like 50�I
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:32.740]  think to start, you could get one for it's like 50 bucks a month, and it's prepaid. You don't
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:37.300]  have to get in a contract or anything. But even 50 bucks felt like too much to waste on this thing.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:45.140]  Well, you know, and I don't regret the $100. I feel like I got $100 worth of curiosity answered.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.900]  And just using it at home on the Wi Fi network is more than enough to satisfy my questions about it.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.780]  I don't feel like the ability to actually go out and use it outside the house would answer
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:00.580]  anything other than, you know, so I haven't been able to send any text messages because I don't
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:05.700]  have a SIM card in it. And I haven't been able to place an actual phone call. But I don't like
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:10.020]  talking on the phone anyway. But who does? Yeah, who does that? Right. Who uses the phone part of
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.460]  the phone? Right. And when I say that it's not good, when I say that it's not good, I do not
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:23.140]  mean in comparison to a $700 iPhone five s, which is truly not a fair comparison, a $99 unlocked
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:29.460]  phone to an iPhone five s that in the unlocked, you know, sells for seven or $800, which is that's
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:36.180]  not a fair comparison. I would say and I don't have it here. So I can't, you know, I don't have
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:42.020]  one in the house. But where Nokia has been going on, and now Nokia is, you know, handset division
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:50.260]  is part of Microsoft. And Motorola has been going on Android, in terms of lower cost smartphones.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:57.780]  And I did see when I was out at build for the Microsoft conference a month ago, I saw a low end
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:05.700]  Nokia, Windows phone handset that I think unlocked was I could be wrong here, but it was like $129.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:13.140]  dollars. Way better than this device. Like, you know, and again, not, you know, definitely not
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:20.180]  iPhone five, five s five c iPhone five, anything, you know, caliber, not even iPhone four s caliber,
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:25.860]  but pretty good, like in terms of things like frame rate, and, you know, load a web page and
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.380]  slide your thumb around and how does it keep up with your thumb and stuff like that pretty good.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.660]  And I know Motorola has a new thing, I forget which the model number is, but they have one
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:41.460]  that's like $129. And so they're not quite at the $99 price I paid for this, but 129 to 99
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:49.620]  is pretty fair comparison. And this this phone has got a lot of problems. Video, so when you
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:56.260]  shoot video on this phone, it's like 380 by like 240 pixels, which is really a pretty,
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:06.180]  pretty low size. And it's 15 frames per second. So you're you know, I mean, it's it's almost like
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:11.220]  if that's all they were able to put in here, I almost I mean, I guess it's better than nothing,
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.460]  but it's not much better than nothing. Yeah. Can you remember? Do you remember that the original
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:23.220]  iPhone didn't shoot video? Yeah, that's that is I caught myself thinking about that kind of crazy.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:26.420]  Is that right? I was like, that can't be right. And then they like went back and looked and I was
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:33.140]  like, Yep, that was right. But I do think I'll bet that that was the sort of decision Apple made with
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:38.580]  the original iPhone where they probably could have done something like shot posted stamp sized
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:43.140]  15 frames per second video and they were like, it'd be better not to even shoot video than
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:50.180]  to offer video like that. Eventually there was an app. How did that work? Right. That's sort of
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:56.980]  when did video come to the iPhone? Was it? Was it? Was it on the 3G 3GS? Because the 3GS 3G only
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:04.180]  because it needed a better processor, right? The 3G only added 3G and a new a new case design,
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.580]  right? But technically, it didn't it didn't increase the CPU's, you know, didn't increase
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:14.180]  the RAM didn't increase the storage. The one and only technical difference other than the outside
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:22.900]  appearance between the original iPhone and the 3G was 3G. Maybe there was a jailbreak app that added
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:28.020]  video to the earlier ones because I remember that there was one and I never I never installed it
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:32.740]  just because it but I think by the that point, I already moved on. The camera is just really bad
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:37.220]  the video. It's not just that the video is low. It's it really takes terrible, terrible photographs.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:47.140]  And again, I so with the Nokia one, the Nokia is low end $129 smartphone. The only photos I got to
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.820]  take I was in a room in Moscone where they had demo unit set up for media to play with. I mean,
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:59.380]  but I could I the Nokia has a, you know, if anything, they have it. Yeah. If anything,
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:04.740]  Apple just Apple just hire their Yeah. Yeah. And from everything I've read about it,
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.460]  that's a pretty big hire that he wasn't, it's not just the name that he actually was largely,
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.500]  you know, played a big part in making Nokia. They're either one and two or two and one.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:18.260]  I mean, that's, you know, more or less the gist is that the two best companies that
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.420]  at mobile photography right now are Apple and Nokia. And it doesn't matter which one you think
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:27.380]  is one and which ones to, you know, they're just leading the way in terms of image quality and
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.820]  features and stuff. And this phone from ZTE is just it just feels like it's at least 10 years old.
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:39.540]  And it makes me wonder about Firefox in general. I mean, I you know, I've
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:47.460]  was never really a full time Firefox user on the on the desktop. But it just it's like,
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:52.820]  why are they way it just feels to me like this is just a waste of time on their part. I don't know.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:58.500]  And I feel like they're they feel locked out because these mobile platforms don't allow
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:04.900]  at least iOS certainly doesn't allow them to include their own rendering engine. You know,
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:10.020]  even Chrome doesn't get to Chrome for iOS doesn't use the Chrome rendering engine.
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:15.860]  It's just a Chrome wrapper around the system's WebKit version. You know, and so if you're a
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:22.420]  company like Mozilla, that you know that the whole point of your existence is to have your rendering
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:29.060]  and engine out there powering people surfing the web, I can see why you would want a mobile
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:33.060]  operating system of your own so you could do it. But if this is how far behind you are,
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.620]  boy, it's it's gonna be tough to get anybody to I just can't see why anybody would buy it.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:44.100]  If you have the $99 to spend on it, I just can't see why you wouldn't save up another 30 and get
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:49.140]  a Motorola Android phone or get a Nokia Windows 8 phone when you get so much more
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:53.220]  and much more likely to get the Android phone. I mean, well, statistically,
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.740]  more people would get the Android phone. Yeah, well, they would right now, at least
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.780]  statistically, although, you know, because you're buying into a bigger ecosystem, right?
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:05.700]  I just feel and I feel like the only other reason I can think of them someone would buy this phone
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:11.460]  would be the politics of it, you know, that you support the the whole political angle of Mozilla
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:17.780]  and the, you know, open web and etc, etc. But I just don't see how there's enough people out
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:24.420]  there that that's a statistically valid number of people. Right now, it looks like it erased
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:33.540]  my notebook. I had some notes, but they're, they were written using the notebook app on the actual
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:39.780]  phone and and it seems as though now they're they're gone. That's a shame. I can remember a
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:46.580]  lot of them. One of the big problems with this operating system is it does not support selecting
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:52.500]  text. So there's no cut copy. So it's a lot like the original iPhone.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.500]  It is. And, you know, and there's, you know, I twittered about some of these things and people,
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:03.780]  you know, who support, you know, you know, who are fans of that, I guess, you know,
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:09.140]  tried to call me a hypocrite for it that, you know, how was it okay for Apple in 2007 when
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.460]  the iPhone was new and it's not okay now? Well, that's because it's not 2007 anymore, right?
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.980]  It's, you know, the world's moved on. And
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:24.260]  other people called me out the other way. And when I said that it was unacceptable,
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.620]  it was acceptable for Apple then, but it's unacceptable now. And they said,
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.660]  no, it was unacceptable for Apple then too. It used to drive me nuts.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:37.300]  But my point to them is that no, that was annoying. Then it was like an obvious
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:41.220]  shortcoming, but it was clearly acceptable because we were using it. And you're even
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.340]  admitting that you still used it, right? We were frustrated by it, but we still use it.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.780]  When I say it's unacceptable now, I mean, I can't imagine why someone would buy this phone where
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:54.180]  they can't select, cut, copy and paste when for about the same amount of money, they could buy
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.220]  a different one that does. I mean, everything has to be taken in context, right? Like, I mean,
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:07.540]  the context of 2007 was the iPhone was an amazing phone for the time, even with its flaws, right?
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:11.940]  That people, and we did put up with it with those shortcomings. And I just can't see why someone
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:16.900]  would put up with these now. I can't believe that it erased my notes. I think it's because I might
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:21.460]  have let the battery die. I don't know. Didn't like what you were saying about it.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.820]  You can't even the web browser, which you would think would be the one thing that might be good
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:39.220]  because it's, you know, Firefox is own thing. It's not good. You can't do things like jumped,
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:43.620]  like when you're scrolled down, you can't jump to the top. Like it doesn't have the iPhone thing
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:49.140]  where you just tap the status bar and scroll to the top. But the only way to get to the interface
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.860]  to manage your multiple tabs is at the top. So if you're scrolled down on a web page and you want to
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.940]  switch to another tab that's open, you have to sit there and flick, flick, flick, flick, flick,
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.460]  flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick, flick.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:05.860]  And it doesn't really have a lot of inertia either. So if it's a long enough page that
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:10.260]  you've been reading, I'm not exaggerating how many flicks you need to get to the top, which is where
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:23.380]  the tab management is. And there's no bookmarks. Therefore, there's no bookmark. Let's and I use,
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:29.380]  you know, it's there's no book. There are no bookmarks. No, not that I can tell.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.380]  I don't know if there's bookmarks. I don't know how you how you make them.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:40.500]  Well, I guess our bookmarks here. Oh, yeah, I've just found it. Well, let's just say that the
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:50.980]  bookmarks are hidden. It's not intuitive. No, not intuitive. The email client isn't too bad. It's
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:58.180]  got a decent IMAP client. It's usable, at least. But they just and you know, and it's this whole
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.740]  is a Thunderbird is a branded Thunderbird. Is that no, are they owned by? Oh, I don't know if
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.900]  they talk about Thunderbird anymore. No, they call it it's just called email. And in fact,
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:14.100]  I think what's interesting is they they spell it e dash capital M ai l, which to me looks like and I
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.740]  you know, God knows I love some curmudgeonly grammar and spelling and stuff like that. But
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:28.180]  the dash in email feels kind of old timey feels a little 1990s. And they have a thing called
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:33.060]  marketplace, which is like their app store. But really, it's just sort of like a directory of
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:39.700]  mobile operated mobile optimized websites. And when you create an app and download an app out
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:43.700]  of one of these things, it's really just you know, like when you're on iOS, like when you
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:49.540]  use the plus button and save a web page as an app, and it just you just lose the browser Chrome.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.100]  So that's like what the Twitter app for this thing is the Twitter app is just
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:59.780]  a it seems a little bit different than when you go to Twitter on an iPhone, but not much.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.460]  And I haven't done that in so long. And therefore, though, you can't do anything now,
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:12.180]  you can't do anything like have two different accounts any more than you can have two accounts
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:18.900]  on, you know, the Twitter website. There's no account switching. So it's just, you know,
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:22.660]  when you use Twitter on this, it's just the mobile Twitter website.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:29.140]  Yeah, I remember that those days of using like the mobile Major League Baseball site and all those
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.940]  the websites mobile. Yeah, right. Right. No, that's a lot like using this.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:43.460]  Mostly mostly because of edge. All right. Not because they were better. They were just
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:48.660]  they loaded faster. Right. And so, on the one hand, there's the web and what you call the web
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:52.100]  as a developer can mean different things to different people. And one thing could just be
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:26:02.180]  using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to do the actual layout and development of the app.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:08.100]  And web OS worked that way, right from palm and later HP, where apps were really just sort of
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:13.460]  like bundles that inside were implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And there's nothing
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:19.620]  wrong with that. Although there's some performance problems you have to overcome if you want to be
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:29.460]  compared favorably to native code, like Objective C running on iOS, or even the Java type byte code
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:38.100]  that you run on Android. But it could be overcome. But what Firefox OS does really is just load
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:43.460]  things, you know, actual websites over the internet and save them. And so a lot of stuff
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:49.460]  stops working if you don't have an internet connection. Like there's games they called
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:53.620]  the games you can get. But then if you don't have an internet connection, the games don't load
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:59.940]  because you can't connect to the server anymore. And it's not entirely cached locally. And I just
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:06.980]  don't feel like there's any, you know, I don't we haven't gotten to a place where always having an
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:14.660]  internet connection is a thing, right? Right. I thought of you because what was the thing you
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.980]  bought? You bought the for similar reasons? Like I want to find out what the how the other side
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:26.100]  lives. You bought the fire tablet, right? No, I bought the Nexus seven Nexus seven. Yeah. How's
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:36.980]  that going? It's rather somewhere. Didn't work out that great. No, it was it was it was all right.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:44.020]  I mean, it's, you know, for I mean, I think in that case, at the price, because it was only,
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:48.420]  you know, this was a couple years ago now. And it was only 200 bucks. It was like an eight gigabyte.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:54.820]  It was at a price point that there wasn't an iPad available at that price point. And, you know,
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:28:03.300]  there's it's a ecosystem that has apps and Android is a full fledged operating system. So it was OK,
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:10.660]  but I, you know, not a year into using it, I ended up having battery problems and then,
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.940]  you know, had to reset it, recondition it to get it to the point where it would really hold
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:22.100]  a charge for a good amount of time. And then one of the things I wanted to use it for was listening
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:29.380]  to music on, you know, on my desk as I was working. And it was just there was a lot of
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:37.380]  bleed through in the device of sound, you know, from other electronics, the kind of problems that
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:42.020]  we used to have. I mean, it seems like we used to have those problems like I used to have to turn
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.900]  off. Yeah, that the phone to do a podcast or that kind of thing. Or if you got your headphones too
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:53.700]  close to your laptop, you'd get weird. Yeah, back. Yeah. And it wasn't it's not it wasn't
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.980]  the headphone because it's the same headphones that I use with my iPhone and everything else.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:03.940]  And I don't get it with any other device other than other than that. So the other thing about
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:10.260]  this Firefox phone, it has a four point zero inch screen. I think the aspect ratio is a little bit
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:16.340]  wider when you're holding it in portrait than the iPhone. But roughly, it's roughly an iPhone
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:21.460]  size device. And I do find that comfortable. I don't find myself wishing that the screen
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:28.020]  were bigger. I don't know. I feel like I don't know. I feel like I'm going to it's going to
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:36.100]  be a problem for me if the new iPhone is bigger. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I mean, I'll wait until I see
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:41.380]  it. But I don't feel like I want a bigger iPhone, particularly. I'm curious. The other thing I guess
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:44.900]  I'm curious about, and it occurred to me when I was thinking about how the buttons are the same
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:49.700]  as the iPhone, except for the lack of a mute switch. But most phones don't have mute switches.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:57.940]  And Apple, who is notoriously sort of minimalist on including hardware buttons, you know, I love
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:03.220]  the mute switch on the iPhone. I don't like whenever I try out these other phones, and you
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:08.100]  have to do like this one, the way to get into mute is you hold down the power button. And instead of,
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:13.780]  you know, like as though to turn off the phone, but you get a menu with four options, turn off
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:20.260]  airplane mode, or turn it on silence incoming calls, restart power off. And I think Android
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:26.100]  does the same thing where if you want to, at least an Android phone that I had a while ago did,
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.940]  where if you wanted to turn off the sound, you hold down the power button, wait for a menu to
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:40.020]  come up and then hit it. I love that like, you know, at the start of my son's concert a couple
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.180]  weeks ago, I didn't even have to take my phone out of my pocket. I just, you know, just toggled,
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:48.020]  stick your hand in and yeah, just toggle the switch and then I know it's not going to make a
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:56.660]  sound. I do the opposite. I mean, I almost always have it in mute and only when I'm expecting a call
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:02.580]  that I want. Do I turn it off mute? Yeah, I could do that too. Or just to double check it really.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.340]  A lot of times when I want to turn on mute, it already is on mute and I don't turn it off.
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.540]  I thought you were going to say that you do the opposite. And when your son's school is
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:14.660]  going to have a concert, you turn your phone up real loud. I got to take this. Sorry.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:20.580]  I thought that's what you were going to say. Spend 45 minutes in the lobby
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:28.420]  drinking. Please turn off silence. I do the opposite. You're not going to tell me when
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:35.780]  to silence my phone. I'm turning mine up and I've set my ringtone to a song with
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:42.020]  inappropriate lyrics. Get wrestled out of the school program by some bouncers.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:48.820]  Now, I'd seen like back in the fall, I'd seen a few things,
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:57.780]  people predicting that Firefox OS was really going to take off and change the playing field.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:04.340]  If they had come out with this in 2009, two years after the iPhone, I would say maybe,
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:11.140]  you know, because that's when Android was new too. Maybe a little bit ahead of that, but it was,
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:17.380]  I think it was the end of 2008 when the first Android phone came out. The HTC,
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.460]  was it the HTC One? I forget what it was called, but I think it was Brown.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:29.380]  It had a keyboard that came out of the side and had a lot of problems. I had a lot of problems
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:36.580]  just like this where it was like they were still growing out. They'd started with the idea of an
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.380]  operating system that required a keyboard and required an up-down left rice device. So if you
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:45.220]  wanted to select text on that Android phone, you had to use the roller ball. You couldn't
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:52.580]  use your finger on the touch screen. You had to go to the roller ball. It just feels like something
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:59.940]  from that era. It's just a long, long time ago though since I could have used a phone of any
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:07.620]  operating system where you can't even select text. It just feels bizarre. It just makes me think that
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:14.100]  Mozilla as a whole is just off in their own cocoon and echo chamber in terms of the politics of the
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:24.820]  whole thing are the only reason keeping it afloat and whatever remaining traction or momentum I
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:30.180]  guess that they have of all the people who switched to Firefox on Windows a decade ago,
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:36.340]  still giving them some revenue because they go up to the search bar and search through Google and
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:43.380]  that they have a revenue share deal with Google. But it's all, anything that's going on that gives
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:51.940]  them any value is 10 years old. There's still nowhere in terms of actual mobile. Kind of sad,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:59.220]  but not surprising. But open. But totally open. John Moltz, thanks for joining me.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.540]  I say we call it a show. Where should we tell people to go? We could tell them to go to your
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:11.460]  very nice website. Very nice website.net. And your podcast is called Don't Make Me Go Back There.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:17.220]  So we should buy that URL. It's called Don't Make Me Turn This- Turning This-
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:23.940]  Don't Make Me Turn This- Car Around- Automobile Over on the Freeway. Turning This Car Around.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.620]  Turning This Car Around with John Armstrong and Casey Liss. And the other guy.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:30.820]  Casey Liss. Casey Liss. Casey Liss. Exactly.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.260]  It's about three dads who get kicked out of school functions for-
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.340]  Get in a car accident on the highway. Yeah.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:35:07.300]  Yeah. I don't text and drive, but I do turn my ringer up during school play.
