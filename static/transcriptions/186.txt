[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  We probably should have recorded last week, but I had stuff to do.
[00:04.160 --> 00:07.800]  And so here we are, one week later after you and I saw each other in Cupertino
[00:07.800 --> 00:13.000]  for a mysterious, I think it was billed to me as a Mac roundtable.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.400]  How was it billed to you in advance of our meeting last week?
[00:16.400 --> 00:22.800]  Yeah, but the feature of the Mac or whatever.
[00:22.800 --> 00:29.360]  So I went into it with thinking 50-50 in my head
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.120]  whether this was going to be...
[00:32.120 --> 00:32.800]  That's all I knew.
[00:32.800 --> 00:35.600]  It was going to be about the Mac and it was going to be a roundtable discussion
[00:35.600 --> 00:42.640]  with a couple of executives and a handful of members of the media.
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.040]  And I went into it thinking, well, this has got to be about the Mac Pro
[00:48.040 --> 00:50.360]  because it's not an event.
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.840]  It's the opposite of events, very small.
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.680]  And how can they have something about the Mac and not address the elephant in the room
[00:59.680 --> 01:03.880]  that was the thousand and some day old Mac Pro?
[01:03.880 --> 01:07.320]  So I went into it thinking 50-50, this is either going to be good news about the Mac Pro
[01:07.320 --> 01:08.720]  or bad news about the Mac Pro.
[01:08.720 --> 01:11.720]  Like we're done with the Mac Pro.
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.960]  Or we're not done with the Mac Pro, but we can't show it yet and here's why.
[01:16.960 --> 01:19.400]  What were you thinking?
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.840]  Yeah, you're probably smarter than me.
[01:20.840 --> 01:21.280]  I don't know.
[01:21.280 --> 01:29.080]  I didn't really connect it directly to the Mac Pro, although in hindsight,
[01:29.080 --> 01:31.600]  it seems fairly reasonable to do that.
[01:31.600 --> 01:33.720]  I mean, I guess I did a little bit.
[01:33.720 --> 01:37.320]  You know, obviously the Mac Pro is sort of the elephant in the room in a lot of ways
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.680]  for Apple and the Mac in the sweep of the Mac universe.
[01:41.680 --> 01:49.600]  But I think it was definitely an opportunity to say, you know, hey,
[01:49.600 --> 01:51.440]  here's some things we're thinking about about the Mac.
[01:51.440 --> 01:55.840]  But I mean, it all, as you probably picked up on it, it was very odd because, you know,
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.920]  very rarely, as everybody knows, does Apple actually say, hey,
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.240]  we're going to talk about future things, you know?
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.800]  So that aspect of it was confusing to me and my only inkling about that was like,
[02:07.800 --> 02:10.200]  oh, they need to set something up, you know?
[02:10.200 --> 02:11.560]  Right.
[02:11.560 --> 02:16.920]  Well, my thinking was that it could be that that would be very similar
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.520]  to how they would announce the end of life of the Mac Pro if that had been their decision.
[02:21.520 --> 02:28.800]  They're not going to hold a product announcement event for a product that's end of life.
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.720]  Right.
[02:29.720 --> 02:36.920]  And I feel like even if the answer was let's just make pro quality iMacs
[02:36.920 --> 02:43.080]  when they unveil them on stage, they're not going to want to sully that on stage by saying,
[02:43.080 --> 02:46.960]  oh, and remember the Mac Pro, we don't need that anymore.
[02:46.960 --> 02:47.520]  Right.
[02:47.520 --> 02:54.800]  That they would want to break it in a non keynote type scenario, whether it's, you know,
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.040]  somebody in particular gets an exclusive or a handful of people get an exclusive
[03:00.040 --> 03:02.080]  and get a chance to ask questions about it.
[03:02.080 --> 03:05.040]  I think it would have been very similar if that had been their decision.
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.880]  And I think that, you know, obviously the reason why they, you know, that wasn't the news.
[03:09.880 --> 03:16.280]  The news in fact is that they are hard at work on an all new Mac Pro, but because they're
[03:16.280 --> 03:25.280]  so far away from shipping it, uh, which we, we can get into next, um, that they felt like
[03:25.280 --> 03:28.520]  they had to say something they had to, they could not just wait.
[03:28.520 --> 03:33.560]  And they wanted to, I think combined with the fact that they wanted to release speed
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.320]  bumps or price drops, whatever you want to call what it is they've done with the current
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.520]  Mac Pro last week where they at the same price levels, they've, they've gone from, you know,
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.760]  the entry level is no longer four core, it's six core and the mid level one is no longer
[03:48.760 --> 03:50.840]  six core, it's eight core or something like that.
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.520]  Um, if that's all they did is just re update the store and not say anything about the future.
[03:57.720 --> 04:00.360]  People would have lost their, lost their damn minds.
[04:00.360 --> 04:00.680]  Rightly.
[04:00.680 --> 04:03.240]  So people would have lost their minds rightly.
[04:03.240 --> 04:07.720]  So because it wouldn't have made any sense that, that Apple is pretending that this was normal.
[04:07.720 --> 04:08.600]  Right.
[04:08.600 --> 04:15.320]  It's one of those scenarios where context free, you know, update would have caused many,
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.160]  many more problems than it, you know, solved, I guess is the word.
[04:19.160 --> 04:19.560]  Right.
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.000]  Yeah.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.480]  And I, I think that that's unusual, an unusual position for them to be in to feel strongly
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.720]  enough about, you know, the future of a particular category for them to set it up or tee it up
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.440]  in that way.
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.200]  Cause a lot of times they just sort of take their lumps, you know, they'll just, they'll
[04:38.200 --> 04:40.920]  just do it and people will misconstrue it or whatever.
[04:41.480 --> 04:45.320]  And then they'll come out with the thing that they, they were teeing up and then either
[04:45.320 --> 04:48.920]  people will like it or they won't, you know, but in this case, I guess they felt strongly
[04:48.920 --> 04:54.920]  enough about how long it had been or how, you know, how much culpability they felt,
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.960]  I guess, you know, in, in how the thing played out, that they felt that they needed to, to,
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.200]  uh, contextualize it.
[05:02.200 --> 05:03.240]  Contextualize it.
[05:04.760 --> 05:12.600]  I feel like a week later, I feel like it, there is no simple answer.
[05:12.600 --> 05:20.760]  I feel like part of it in terms of, you know, I think you, you, you answer, you ask the
[05:20.760 --> 05:27.480]  question and you preface it with, I don't want to get too personal, but the gist of
[05:27.480 --> 05:30.840]  the question was when the hell, which always means that somebody's about to get personal,
[05:30.840 --> 05:34.760]  right? When did you guys realize you've done fucked up? I mean, that's not what you said,
[05:35.480 --> 05:42.200]  but we, so for everybody who doesn't have it in top of their minds, it was, it was nine
[05:42.200 --> 05:48.360]  of us at the table. It was, it was representing Apple was, uh, Phil Schiller, uh, Craig Federighi
[05:48.360 --> 05:55.320]  talking software, uh, and John Ternus, T E R N U S who was a vice president of hardware.
[05:55.320 --> 05:59.640]  And, and as it was described to us at the beginning of the meeting on his plate, our
[05:59.640 --> 06:08.600]  iPad pro and Mac pro and maybe Mac book pro, I forget what they said they did, but, but I know
[06:08.600 --> 06:13.960]  iPad pro and a couple of others. And I think, and honestly, and he was, you know, had very good
[06:13.960 --> 06:19.160]  things to say at the round table, but just talking to a couple of other people at Apple in the last
[06:19.160 --> 06:24.120]  week after this came out, it sounds to me like he's Ternus is a real up and comer at the company.
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.520]  Like, I don't think it's the last time that we are going to hear from him in a, some sort of,
[06:28.520 --> 06:36.120]  you know, publicity facing event. It seems to me like he's a real up and comer. Um, and the fact
[06:36.120 --> 06:39.880]  that he's been tasked with, all right, you're right. Going to run point on hardware on this
[06:39.880 --> 06:44.840]  new Mac pro is, is a sign of that. And I think a good sign, I think people, people who are hoping
[06:44.840 --> 06:49.400]  that this Mac pro is everything Mac pro users have been hoping for. I think the fact that John
[06:49.400 --> 06:56.360]  Ternus is in charge of it is a very good sign. Um, and then on the press side, it was, uh, me and
[06:56.360 --> 07:03.720]  you, um, you know, you know, freed who was recently of recode, but it's now at a new site called
[07:03.720 --> 07:08.920]  Axios for those of you who don't follow the comings and goings of the press very closely. Um,
[07:10.440 --> 07:17.960]  John Patzkowski also recently recode, but now at Buzzfeed and last but not least, um,
[07:18.840 --> 07:24.680]  Lance Ulanoff who was there from Mashable. So former recode writers, uh, were well represented.
[07:24.680 --> 07:28.600]  Nobody from recode was there at the moment. It was a large category
[07:30.680 --> 07:37.880]  percentage wise. Yes. 40% 40% of press attendees were formerly of recode. And then last but not
[07:37.880 --> 07:43.000]  least, uh, or maybe possibly least was, was bill Evans from Apple PR who was at the table,
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.080]  but as his Apple PRs want, he was more or less there to play defense and,
[07:47.080 --> 08:01.400]  and pretty much just run the clock and didn't really, um, um, so, uh, I, I thought that the,
[08:02.840 --> 08:07.400]  we all tried to ask, I would say everybody except Patzkowski who only popped piped in at the end
[08:07.400 --> 08:13.480]  with a very well-timed question about the Mac mini. Um, everybody tried to ask a, when did you
[08:13.480 --> 08:18.280]  guys figure out that you had a real problem on your hands with the design of the 2013 trashcan
[08:18.280 --> 08:26.920]  Mac and B when did you guys start on this project of a new Mac, you know, a rethought from the
[08:26.920 --> 08:33.320]  ground up Mac pro and Apple does not like to talk about timelines. I mean, that's, I mean,
[08:33.320 --> 08:36.360]  they don't like to talk about future stuff. They don't like to talk about all sorts of things,
[08:36.360 --> 08:41.560]  but they do not like to talk about when in the past they made decisions and how long things took
[08:41.560 --> 08:47.800]  it is more than almost more than anything else. They don't like to like, once a design of a new
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.440]  product comes out, they will talk, you know, Johnny, I will talk at length openly and honestly,
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.600]  and in his little narrated videos about why something is the way it is. Um, they won't tell
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.760]  you in advance, but once it's out, they'll say, here's why we have these gently sloped corners
[09:02.760 --> 09:10.120]  here or, um, or whatever. But in terms of how long they've been working on blank, they just,
[09:10.120 --> 09:16.280]  it is, it's like the holiest of holies, the secret of secrets. And they've stonewalled us.
[09:16.280 --> 09:21.000]  I think they view that as their, as, as part of their IP almost because it's part of their
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.680]  process. And so they view that those timelines and the, the, how long it takes things to get
[09:26.680 --> 09:31.960]  things right, or, you know, what abortive attempts they had at a particular thing or whatever,
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.440]  before they settled on the right path, they view that all as like a protected category of
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.080]  information that's about their process. That's a part of their secret, their special sauce.
[09:41.080 --> 09:49.720]  Right. Um, and so, but there were little dribs and drabs that you going over it, especially after
[09:49.720 --> 09:56.520]  the, you know, writing my piece all night long and then, and then reading everybody else's the
[09:56.520 --> 10:01.160]  next day and then having a day to sort of breathe and then rethink it all and look at the transcript
[10:01.160 --> 10:10.760]  again. Um, I think that the most telling remark was Federighi's saying that they had painted
[10:10.760 --> 10:17.240]  themselves into a thermal corner and, and, and combined with his saying that they went through
[10:17.240 --> 10:21.000]  like the stage, you know, it was, it said in a jovial fashion, and it did get a laugh that
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.520]  they went through the stages of grief or something like that. Right. Um, which to me reading between
[10:26.520 --> 10:34.440]  the lines says that they did try to update the Mac pro at least several times in, in between
[10:35.320 --> 10:42.200]  2013 and the point where they said, okay, we've got to give up on this. And it seemed like by,
[10:42.200 --> 10:47.800]  you know, by trying to answer customers requests for what they wanted from a newer Mac pro,
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.320]  it was mostly about more powerful GPUs, but more powerful GPUs threw off the thermal balance of the
[10:55.320 --> 11:02.760]  Mac pro as we know it and that there, you know, and so I, who knows, I'm guessing at least,
[11:03.480 --> 11:10.760]  at least two years was spent on at some degree trying to update and get more powerful GPUs
[11:10.760 --> 11:17.400]  into that, that configuration. And at some point they gave up. What do you, what was your take on
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.280]  that? Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's two different questions, right? The timeline is one question,
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.640]  you know, how, how long do you think it took them? And then the other question is,
[11:28.200 --> 11:34.280]  did they actually make attempts at it or did they go, Hey, you know, we really, there's nothing
[11:34.280 --> 11:38.360]  really we can do here because they just knew from all of the, from the building of the thing in the
[11:38.360 --> 11:45.080]  first place, they built it specifically to take advantage of this split or balanced GPU scenario
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.400]  and, you know, shoving one hot GPU and it was never going to work. I don't know, you know,
[11:51.400 --> 11:57.880]  I don't know how much modeling or prototyping or theory, you know, work they did on saying,
[11:58.440 --> 12:06.280]  what if we jammed an Nvidia 1080, you know, I in here, TI in here and, and said, can we get this to
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.840]  run in here, you know, in the shell with proper thermal properties or whatever. I don't know how
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.560]  far along that road they went or did they just say, well, this is not the purpose we built it
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.640]  for at all. So can we get two GPUs in here that will work together in such a way to where it would
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.320]  provide a significant value to our customers? And then they get, they said, no, you know,
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.760]  all we can do is give it a bump so that people on this current gen can just roll with it until we
[12:32.760 --> 12:41.160]  get out what's due. I don't know, you know, I think it's, it's hard. It's harder for me to say
[12:41.160 --> 12:47.640]  that they went and built whole new units in this case than if they were working on a new product,
[12:47.640 --> 12:53.960]  which they would undoubtedly do. They'll, you know, they'll build fully, full tilt, all produced,
[12:53.960 --> 12:58.840]  you know, devices if they feel that they need to, to figure out whether it works or not when they're
[12:58.840 --> 13:04.040]  creating a new product. On something like this, I guess maybe, I guess maybe they did, they would,
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.280]  you know, I have no information. I'm just trying to like divine from what I know about the process
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.320]  that they go through, but it seems like, it seems like it's a possibility. One thing we don't have
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.840]  to speculate on. I mean, this is just a fact it's obvious just by studying the device. And it's also
[13:18.840 --> 13:25.560]  obvious, just listening to the way Apple described it in 2013, when it, when it was announced is
[13:25.560 --> 13:35.400]  that the, the trashcan Mac pro from 2013 was a bet on multi-threaded GPUs as the future of GPU
[13:35.400 --> 13:41.720]  power. And, and they had a software story to tell about it. I think, you know, without getting too
[13:41.720 --> 13:47.400]  complicated, I think it was mostly sort of an open CL type thing. But in the meantime, in the years
[13:47.400 --> 13:54.520]  since Apple has sort of stepped away from open CL, and I think the bigger story isn't even really
[13:55.880 --> 14:02.120]  Apple's own decisions on software, but more just where did the industry go and in the pro market,
[14:02.120 --> 14:08.840]  it's not so dependent on or defined by Apple in terms of how should you make software for the
[14:08.840 --> 14:17.800]  Mac pro, but more, this is how industry standard, powerful GPU hogging apps are written, you know,
[14:17.800 --> 14:24.520]  things like video editing and 3d, um, which a lot of it is cross-platform probably most of it is
[14:24.520 --> 14:32.680]  cross-platform. Um, and it's the way that that's gone in the four years since we first saw this
[14:32.680 --> 14:41.880]  Mac pro it's gotten ever more dependent on super powerful single GPUs, which is the opposite of
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.480]  where the Mac pro went. I think in theory, in theory, the Mac pro could have been the future
[14:47.480 --> 14:54.680]  of pro computing, uh, the sort of throwing lots of GPU cores and having software written to take
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.960]  advantage of that. Um, but that's just not where the industry went. And with the software that is
[14:59.960 --> 15:08.520]  ever more dependent on just single threaded GPU performance, the Mac pro is just, it, it just
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.720]  wasn't apt at all.
[15:09.720 --> 15:15.960]  You know, what I keep going back to is this, so I, um, you know, I grew up building computers. I
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.040]  guess a lot of, a lot of folks who are probably listening to this did, you know, or, or grew up
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.880]  at least very interested in how they were put together. Um, and I, I think my, you know, my
[15:25.880 --> 15:32.680]  first computer was like an Amiga that I pieced together out of, you know, random parts, um, from
[15:32.680 --> 15:41.000]  a friend's stores of garbage, cause his dad worked for Pacific bell and then so on and so forth,
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.640]  spiraled outwards from there to PCs and you know, x86 machines and, um, you know, on, on through
[15:47.640 --> 15:53.240]  the windows train or dos train and then windows train and all that, simply because I, it was the
[15:53.240 --> 15:57.800]  thing that I could afford and I could put together myself, uh, somewhere along the line, along the
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.480]  line there, I developed like this parallel track with, uh, starting with the performer line, uh,
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.280]  and going, uh, you know, up through there where I always had a Mac in the house as well. And then
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.680]  my mom would use it. I would use it for graphic design and like eventually Photoshop stuff once
[16:12.680 --> 16:18.760]  they became more powerful. Uh, and, and, you know, a variety of other things, but I always had like
[16:18.760 --> 16:24.200]  this parallel track of computing, but I spent the majority of my time on PCs simply because they
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.800]  were great for gaming and I was just a, you know, massive gamer and, you know, still am to a degree,
[16:29.800 --> 16:36.040]  but the platform itself was obviously, you know, very much pushed forward by gamers. You know,
[16:36.040 --> 16:42.120]  there were other industries that were responsible for pushing certain components of the computer,
[16:42.120 --> 16:48.280]  you know, of the CPU or the GPU or whatever forward, depending on their needs,
[16:48.280 --> 16:52.600]  their specific needs, obviously, you know, data storage is very much like an enterprise thing and,
[16:52.600 --> 16:59.960]  you know, so on and so forth. But the, the GPU and CPU were pushed very hard for a lot of years by
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.000]  gaming and still are, you know, I mean, obviously GPUs are where they are because of gamers.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.760]  They're not there because of, you know, sure, academics at some stage do need those,
[17:10.760 --> 17:15.560]  but only because it was there, it was sort of like a chicken egg thing. And they, it was,
[17:15.560 --> 17:22.680]  the academics use heavily, you know, GPU centric computing platforms and things now because they can
[17:23.240 --> 17:28.520]  and they're the, but the GPUs are there because the gamers wanted them and the game companies
[17:28.520 --> 17:33.240]  pushed them hard. I mean, I remember playing games that they said, hey, this game looks this
[17:33.240 --> 17:39.000]  good this year, but it'll look even better next year, right? We've already programmed in, you
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.840]  know, the large, the higher, uh, high resolution textures and so on and so forth that we in better
[17:44.840 --> 17:48.920]  physics engines that we know will only, your computer will only support next year. I was,
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.760]  it was a constant thing. I was never much of a gamer, but when I was, you know, 20 years ago,
[17:54.760 --> 18:00.040]  I was much closer to a gamer than I am now. And I remember that even on the Mac, that was true,
[18:00.040 --> 18:06.760]  that, uh, you know, marathon was the big game. That's right. Yeah. Bungee, the, you know,
[18:06.760 --> 18:12.040]  bungees wasn't their first game, but it was the first real smash hit and sort of a predecessor to,
[18:12.040 --> 18:19.080]  uh, uh, what's the game on Xbox, uh, halo, halo, um, marathon was huge and, and it was networked
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.560]  so we could play it against each other. Um, yeah, love that game. You had to be on a local talk
[18:23.560 --> 18:27.720]  network though. You couldn't, this is no old item. You could play over the internet. Yeah,
[18:27.720 --> 18:33.400]  no, no. So yeah, we played, we played that and then we played, uh, doom locally and
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.400]  Duke, Duke of 3d, all this stuff. Yeah. I mean, you get that and that's what drove it.
[18:39.400 --> 18:43.560]  You know, that's what was amazing. What was amazing though is that we'd get a new computer
[18:43.560 --> 18:48.120]  at the student newspaper. We'd, you know, get a new quadra or something and all of a sudden
[18:48.120 --> 18:53.960]  marathon ran way better and it was like, whoa, I remember too, a lot of times too, it was frame
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.760]  rate, right? Like you could, and certain games had settings where you could optimize for frame rate
[18:58.760 --> 19:01.800]  or optimize for graphics, but you could get the girl, you could get the good graphics,
[19:01.800 --> 19:04.840]  but you wouldn't get a great frame rate. And then all of a sudden you get a new computer
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.560]  and you get it all. Um, and it would be night and dark forces and everything was all smooth
[19:09.560 --> 19:15.560]  all of a sudden. Right. Right. Yeah. Uh, no, it's true. I mean, that's what the money,
[19:15.560 --> 19:20.680]  that's the, you know, the money comes from gamers. That's, that's what's driving the industry to,
[19:20.680 --> 19:25.480]  to keep wiping the billions of dollars into research into ever more powerful GPUs.
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.320]  And then like you said, like things like academics who are really just running math,
[19:29.320 --> 19:35.320]  just math or data analysis, it really aren't even pushing pixels to a screen. They're literally just
[19:35.320 --> 19:41.480]  chewing through mounds and mounds of, of quote unquote big data, but you can do it where the,
[19:41.480 --> 19:46.600]  the algorithms run faster on a GPU than a CPU. And they're taking advantage of technology that
[19:46.600 --> 19:52.920]  was developed for games. And, and the Mac pro just was, it just was not where the industry
[19:52.920 --> 19:56.520]  was headed. And no matter how big, no gamer ever looked at the Mac pro and thought, Oh,
[19:56.520 --> 20:01.800]  this is interesting. And heck, they barely looked at the previous generation of Mac pros that way,
[20:01.800 --> 20:06.360]  because they knew that they would be upgrading their GPU within six to nine months to 12 months.
[20:06.360 --> 20:10.680]  Right. And that they would be pushing, you know, looking for that. And they didn't have the
[20:10.680 --> 20:17.240]  confidence that AMD or Nvidia would consistently release that highest, you know, highest
[20:17.240 --> 20:23.320]  performance graphics card for the Mac pro, uh, in that, in that original configuration, much less
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.360]  the new one, obviously where Apple's the one who controls that. Yeah. So what occurs to me and
[20:28.360 --> 20:32.280]  looking at this scenario and, and I mean, it's not just in the last week, but I think
[20:33.320 --> 20:38.760]  having learned now what we now know, I think it's almost certain is that there's at least a little
[20:38.760 --> 20:46.520]  bit of hubris here in the design of the 2013 Mac pro that I think is fueled by the iPhone and iPad
[20:46.520 --> 20:55.400]  where with the iPhone, Apple, the iPhone market in and of itself is so big and so lucrative and
[20:55.400 --> 21:05.720]  that Apple can define the computer architecture of the iPhone and can define the API APIs for
[21:05.720 --> 21:14.680]  creating software for it and runs the app store and can, you know, uh, not really adhere to,
[21:14.680 --> 21:19.800]  you know, define which APIs you use, but sort of make sure that your software is, is, you know,
[21:21.400 --> 21:26.760]  within the lines of how they want software written. Um, but primarily just by being able to
[21:27.320 --> 21:32.680]  define the hardware they can define, if you want your software to run well, you're going to have
[21:32.680 --> 21:37.080]  to do it the way we envision you doing it. Whether, you know, it's not even so much the
[21:37.080 --> 21:42.440]  app store, forget the app store part. It's just, you've got to take advantage of the way the iPhone
[21:42.440 --> 21:49.720]  is architected and the iPhone is so big that developers will do it. I mean, literally they
[21:49.720 --> 21:54.200]  even, you know, and this is less of a big deal today or eat more easily overlooked because it's
[21:54.200 --> 21:58.360]  always been the case. But in the early years of the iPhone, it was a big deal where an awful
[21:58.360 --> 22:02.280]  lot of developers who were like, well, I want, we want our software on the iPhone. We're buying
[22:02.280 --> 22:07.800]  their first max ever because you had to run X code to write. You still have to run X code to
[22:07.800 --> 22:12.600]  write iPhone software and X code only runs on a Mac. And so it was literally, developers were
[22:12.600 --> 22:19.720]  buying an all, an all new machine just to do it. Whereas in the pro, um, high performance
[22:19.720 --> 22:27.400]  computing industry, Apple doesn't have that sort of dominant role. They can't redefine or not.
[22:27.400 --> 22:32.920]  Maybe not redefine is too strong a word, but they can't steer. They couldn't push the industry to
[22:32.920 --> 22:39.160]  switch to a multi-threaded GPU model when everybody else, you know, more or less what Apple
[22:39.160 --> 22:44.520]  needed to do was be humble about it and go with the flow of the industry, which is big honking
[22:44.520 --> 22:52.680]  single GPUs. Yeah. I mean, there's two, so twice, I think it was twice, don't, don't at me or
[22:52.680 --> 22:57.480]  whatever, but I think twice during the interview, they, they said something about, you know, we
[22:57.480 --> 23:02.520]  want to make sure that whatever we do is new and innovative. And I looked at, I thought about that
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.760]  and I was thinking about that during, you know, when they said it, cause they said it again. And
[23:06.760 --> 23:10.920]  when they said it again, I kind of, my ears kind of perked up, you know? Um, because I think that
[23:10.920 --> 23:15.960]  that is, there's two ways to take that statement. You could take that statement and say, Hey,
[23:15.960 --> 23:20.440]  I'm doing something new and innovative. And you can, you could just take it at face value and go,
[23:20.440 --> 23:27.640]  you know what? Great. I'm glad someone is right. I'm glad somebody cares enough to really push and
[23:27.640 --> 23:35.480]  make sure that they're not obeying, uh, accepted norms without questioning them, uh, that they are
[23:35.480 --> 23:41.400]  truly pushing boundaries and, and questioning all of the underpinnings of computing and making sure
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.760]  that the way things are done is actually the right way and the way they should be done. Uh,
[23:46.760 --> 23:50.360]  all of that. Right. And, you know, you can extrapolate, keep, you can keep going from there,
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.480]  all of the things that you would like to, to, to say, to interpret that in the best light possible.
[23:55.480 --> 24:01.960]  And then there's another way to take it, which is we are so interested in doing something new and
[24:01.960 --> 24:11.240]  innovative that we overlook the obvious hurdles because we are so addicted to the slash and burn
[24:11.240 --> 24:17.960]  of, you know, obeying our own recognizance, right? Or relying on our own recognizance to,
[24:17.960 --> 24:23.560]  to chart the course of computing. Cause if you go, Hey, every phone, let's apply this to existing,
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.920]  you know, let's apply this to existing, um, framework of the iPhone. You look at the iPhone,
[24:28.920 --> 24:34.680]  you go, Hey, if you just said, look guys, you can do every other thing, but keyboards are great.
[24:34.680 --> 24:39.400]  You know, keyboards are fantastic. They're fun. They work fine. You know, thumbs press keys makes
[24:39.400 --> 24:44.440]  total sense, right? We work since we were cavemen, we've been manipulating things with our opposable
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.800]  thumbs. Why stop now? I mean, there's plenty of really great arguments that a lot of people made
[24:49.800 --> 24:53.880]  to themselves and really convinced themselves were right. And that's why there was a lot of blowback
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.760]  against the no physical keyboard thing. So Apple in that moment, you know, maybe this is Steve's
[24:58.760 --> 25:03.000]  genius of saying, no, this is the right way. Or maybe this is a collective genius, which is more
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.080]  likely where Steve acts as the editor for a lot of people's flurry of ideas. Yeah, I think we can
[25:07.080 --> 25:10.920]  make this work. And you know, it's so, so much simpler, less moving parts and blah, blah, blah,
[25:10.920 --> 25:17.400]  tons of arguments on the other side. Right. And they made a decision to, to slice out a very
[25:17.400 --> 25:24.600]  well established, charted course of having that physical keyboard that was not necessarily evil,
[25:24.600 --> 25:30.600]  right? There's nothing bad about it. It's just, they saw pathways that opened up for themselves,
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.200]  if they got rid of it. They're like, man, then we can manipulate the whole screen, the keyboard can
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.880]  go away when you don't need it, you know, blah, blah, blah, right? You know, all of the arguments
[25:37.880 --> 25:42.760]  that we all know so well. But you look at that, and it worked out incredibly well for them. And
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.480]  in fact, not only was it, did it work out well for them, it was the right thing to do. That's
[25:47.480 --> 25:53.800]  why all our phones look the same now, right? But in this case, I think they looked at the problem
[25:53.800 --> 26:01.640]  and said, hey, this is the way it could go, this parallel GPU that splits tasks, it can run lower
[26:01.640 --> 26:06.680]  power when it needs to, you know, it's very, you know, power conscious, which is great for the
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.280]  environment, etc, etc. And there's really no reason that needs to be blown away by the power
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.760]  to be blown all this air all over the place all the time and collecting all this unseemly dust,
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.800]  and why has nobody ever thought of this? And they got so excited about the fact that they could do
[26:21.800 --> 26:28.520]  this thing, that they didn't stop and ask themselves, well, is the simpler, straighter,
[26:29.320 --> 26:35.240]  you know, more common path, is it a common path for a reason? Like, do we use metal because metal
[26:35.240 --> 26:41.960]  is good, you know? Or do we use a strong, powerful GPU because the industry that we have traditionally
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.680]  not served, gaming industry, uses it and that pushes everything forward and we can ride that
[26:48.680 --> 26:56.120]  wave? Like, why paddle out of the current, right? And generate all of the force on your own, when
[26:56.120 --> 27:02.680]  you can use additive force on the existing current and go, you know what, this is fine, this is our
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.840]  limitation that we have to accommodate this graphics card, now what does that look like?
[27:08.840 --> 27:14.520]  Maybe it's a flat slab with almost nothing else to it that's essentially a GPU, you know, or maybe
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.880]  it's external GPUs or whatever. But I just think that the questions got asked and they applied
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.120]  roughly the same frameworks to it that they did with the iPhone ended up with just the wrong
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.680]  answer. And I don't know why that is. I don't presuppose I'm dumb compared to all these guys
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.320]  and girls they have working on these problems. So, you know, I don't presuppose to know,
[27:33.320 --> 27:36.520]  that's just my supposition as to how the argument went down, you know?
[27:36.520 --> 27:46.360]  And one factor, I guess I knew this, but it got reiterated a few times, is that the Mac Pro had
[27:46.360 --> 27:53.720]  a sort of triangular shape in the tube in the middle, the hollow center, two GPUs and a CPU.
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.160]  And it's not just that it was three things and that air flowed through the center to cool them,
[27:59.160 --> 28:04.440]  but that it was specifically designed that all three sides of that triangle would remain
[28:04.440 --> 28:10.440]  roughly on par with each other in terms of the heat that needed to be dissipated.
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.480]  And it wasn't a design that would accommodate one of the three sides getting hotter than the others.
[28:16.040 --> 28:23.720]  And that's, again, with software that more so now than before this Mac Pro was distributed,
[28:23.720 --> 28:33.400]  that intensive graphics intensive software today is about overloading a single GPU with
[28:33.400 --> 28:39.880]  as much performance as you can get. So even using this configuration to run software that's meant to
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.080]  run single threaded on a GPU, it's just not conducive to that because you can't let one
[28:45.080 --> 28:52.360]  of the GPUs get hotter than another. And it probably plays into the fact that the Mac Pro,
[28:52.360 --> 29:01.160]  as we know it, is sort of notorious for almost like a European sports car, that they're not
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.400]  the most rugged machines or durable machines in terms of reliability over the years that people
[29:07.400 --> 29:12.440]  who've been pushing these machines. There's a lot of people who they seemingly anecdotally,
[29:12.440 --> 29:17.960]  at least, have to go in to get GPUs replaced pretty frequently, primarily from overheating.
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.360]  I mean, that's the only way really a computer part wears out or it's part like a GPU could wear out.
[29:24.600 --> 29:30.040]  All right, let me take a break and we'll come back to this. But let me first thank our first
[29:30.040 --> 29:38.040]  sponsor of this show, Circle from Disney. What is Circle? Circle from Disney is a beautiful
[29:38.040 --> 29:43.800]  little device designed for families to manage content and time online for all the devices in
[29:43.800 --> 29:49.400]  your home. It pairs with just about any Wi-Fi router and it recognizes every device connected
[29:49.400 --> 29:54.840]  to it, tablets, PCs, smartphones, even Chromebooks, anything that connects to the Wi-Fi in your house,
[29:54.840 --> 29:59.560]  it'll recognize it. And then parents can set profiles for each member of the family and tailor
[29:59.560 --> 30:04.440]  the individual preferences for each one. It's very easy to set up. It is exactly what you would think
[30:04.440 --> 30:11.480]  of from something from Disney. It is not like setting up something from Cisco where you need
[30:11.480 --> 30:16.040]  a network engineering degree. It is very much what you would think Disney would design for
[30:16.040 --> 30:22.280]  non-network engineering moms and dads. You just download the app, choose your network. It's that
[30:22.280 --> 30:27.640]  simple. You go from there and just tap things on the app. What kind of things does it let you do?
[30:27.640 --> 30:32.440]  It lets you filter content, customize what's available, and you can set time limits and you
[30:32.440 --> 30:38.520]  can set the time limits on specific things like YouTube, Minecraft, Facebook, Netflix, and even
[30:38.520 --> 30:45.720]  Snapchat. Kids staying up late on their tablet, you can set a bedtime for each kid and their devices.
[30:47.320 --> 30:51.240]  Families can also see how they spend their time online with their insights feature. It's really
[30:51.240 --> 30:56.680]  great. Disney is super stoked about this. They've just, well, a couple of new things. They just
[30:56.680 --> 31:01.480]  launched a new thing about a month ago. It's called circle connections. It lets you connect
[31:01.480 --> 31:07.160]  app services and devices like friend of the show, automatic, you know, the car dingus. Well, now you
[31:07.160 --> 31:14.440]  can hook that up and the family can share stuff like that through the circle. Alexa, IFTTT,
[31:15.480 --> 31:20.520]  ChoreMonster, and others. You can all hook up to your circle. It's sort of turning into a platform.
[31:20.520 --> 31:29.640]  Disney is very excited about this. Recently, Apple's CFO, Luca Maestri, was,
[31:31.560 --> 31:36.280]  held a meeting with the Italian press at the Italian consulate in New York city.
[31:36.280 --> 31:40.120]  And he was talking about how his family uses Apple products and devices. And he specifically
[31:40.120 --> 31:45.400]  mentioned circle with Disney, something that his family uses to manage his family's devices.
[31:45.400 --> 31:49.960]  I will put a link to this in the show notes. I think you're going to need to translate it
[31:49.960 --> 31:54.120]  from Italian, but that's okay. I'm sure most people who listen to the show speak fluent Italian,
[31:55.080 --> 31:59.800]  but that's a pretty cool story. And I'm pretty, you don't really hear Disney or Apple C
[31:59.800 --> 32:04.520]  C-level executives talking up products from other companies all that often. So anyway,
[32:04.520 --> 32:09.480]  it's very exciting stuff. Where do you go to find out more easy, go to meet circle,
[32:09.480 --> 32:17.880]  M E E T circle.com. And remember this code, the talk show, and you will get free shipping
[32:17.880 --> 32:28.440]  and $10 off your circle with Disney device. Uh, it's a $99 product, 89 bucks with the talk show
[32:28.440 --> 32:35.640]  code, uh, and circle go, which is their service for mobile, like a phone, like cellular service
[32:35.640 --> 32:42.600]  is a $9 and 95 cents a month for up to 10 devices iOS only, but that's probably not a problem for
[32:42.600 --> 32:48.440]  problem for listeners of the talk show. So my thanks to Disney meet circle.com code,
[32:48.440 --> 32:56.600]  the talk show, great product. So timeline wise, more spec is here's my take. My take is that
[32:58.920 --> 33:04.920]  in the 20, I mean, cause one thing a couple of people have observed is it's not like this is
[33:04.920 --> 33:09.640]  the first Mac pro that went a long time between updates. The Mac pro had sort of been on a longer
[33:09.640 --> 33:16.440]  than one year update schedule for awhile. So the fact that there wasn't an update in 2014,
[33:16.440 --> 33:21.400]  I don't think struck, I don't think it really surprised anybody. Um, right. My guess is sometime
[33:21.400 --> 33:27.400]  around 2015, 2016 is when an update, certainly by 2016 it was, everybody was talking about it.
[33:27.400 --> 33:32.280]  And certainly Apple was aware of it. I think, I don't know this. I don't have any sort of,
[33:32.280 --> 33:39.400]  you know, super sources inside, but I think, and I don't, I don't think anybody's surprised by this.
[33:39.400 --> 33:49.000]  I think that as, as the around 2015, 2016, as it became more obvious that the design of the Mac pro
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.960]  was problematic, I think there was a sense within Apple that maybe that's okay. And maybe MacBook
[33:55.960 --> 34:05.800]  pros combined with ever more powerful IMAX might be the way future to satisfy the pro users of the
[34:05.800 --> 34:14.120]  Mac market. And I think, and I think this came up at our, at our interview last week. And I think
[34:14.120 --> 34:21.880]  that they sort of emphasized just what a war, so to speak, what w just what a large percentage of
[34:21.880 --> 34:29.720]  their, what they define as pro users are using MacBook pros and IMAX. Uh, and they even mentioned
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.200]  this and if anything, this might've been the most surprising part of the meeting is where they,
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.720]  they mentioned specifically that they have new IMAX in the pipeline that are coming slated for
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.360]  sometime this year, um, that are including configurations that are, that are geared
[34:44.360 --> 34:51.080]  towards pro customers. Um, I think that what happened is that it probably at a very high level,
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.240]  I mean, I'm not naming names. I don't know, but I think at a pretty high level within the company,
[34:55.240 --> 35:04.280]  they talk themselves into believing that the IMAX, including the ever better IMAX combined with the
[35:04.280 --> 35:10.440]  MacBook pros could cover everything they needed to cover. And I think at some point recently,
[35:10.440 --> 35:19.000]  let's say within the last six months or so, maybe a little more, uh, they realize, no, that's that
[35:19.000 --> 35:30.280]  that the 1% of Mac users who can't be satisfied by an IMAX need a, a real pro computer. That's my
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.960]  guess. Yeah. I mean, I think you're, I think you're probably right. If that sounds, that sounds
[35:35.960 --> 35:41.320]  reasonable. I definitely think there was that moment, uh, which they alluded to because they
[35:41.320 --> 35:49.720]  said, but we realized we needed more, um, that they did feel that a larger and larger segment
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.800]  of the pro market was being served by a 5k screen and a computer slept in the back. Um,
[35:56.680 --> 35:59.720]  and you know, I certainly, it's what I've been using for a long time. I haven't had a Mac pro
[35:59.720 --> 36:05.800]  in years and I only had one briefly. And honestly, a lot of the times that I ran Mac pro level
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.800]  machines on, you know, with OS 10 running on them, I ran hackintoshes for the GPU reason,
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.920]  you know, and hackintoshes are becoming a much more, I don't doubt that Apple sees this,
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.880]  right. You know, the diagnostics probably tell them, um, you know, general opt-in diagnostics
[36:21.880 --> 36:27.000]  probably tell them if not pulling the community, but there are an increasing number of people
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.960]  running hackintoshes, uh, which are, you know, PC components that have OS 10 driver support, uh, or
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.160]  have, you know, some sort of cribbed together driver support, uh, and that are, that are being
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.280]  put together. And then you boot OS 10 on them either with the use of a bootloader piece of
[36:46.280 --> 36:51.400]  software or piece of hardware that allows you to boot OS 10 fool OS 10 and is thinking that
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.960]  you're running a Mac. And the advantage that offers is of course you can build according to
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.040]  your precise power needs, perhaps even more powerful than is currently on the market,
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.680]  which is a situation we're in right now with the Mac pro. Um, and then of course you can,
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.640]  you know, you can run windows on a Mac, but now you can run windows on a more powerful Mac that
[37:09.640 --> 37:15.640]  can then run very high performance games or other applications. And so you'll, you'll see people
[37:15.640 --> 37:22.920]  like, um, who was it that recently wrote a, a fairly solid, you know, kind of what it's like
[37:22.920 --> 37:29.400]  to build a hackintosh right now, just recently it was, uh, was it Mike Rundle? I think Mike
[37:29.400 --> 37:33.000]  was mentioning, was talking about running a hackintosh, but somebody else just wrote a
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.520]  piece that was traded around a lot. I mean, you know, many folks have over the years,
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.760]  uh, they build, uh, they build graphics software for the Mac. Um, and it's not, uh,
[37:45.320 --> 37:51.080]  my brain's blanking. I'll try and get back to it if I can. Um, but, uh, the, the gist of it is,
[37:51.080 --> 37:58.040]  is like best of both worlds scenario where they, they love OS 10 and they just, they shutter using
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.720]  windows. They'd use it when they, they need to, to, to make it through, you know, uh, or to,
[38:03.720 --> 38:10.280]  to run software that only runs on windows, AKA, you know, uh, class a games that just don't ship
[38:10.280 --> 38:15.880]  on multiple platforms. Although steam is making that better to a degree. Uh, but the OS 10 is
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.120]  just, you know, the beautiful experience and all that. And they can build this really custom
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.520]  experience underneath it. And I think that that more people being willing to consider a hackintosh
[38:26.520 --> 38:33.400]  and that the community really looking to those, um, builders to, to try and tell them exactly
[38:33.400 --> 38:39.880]  what parts to buy and, you know, exactly how to build in all of that. I think that really speaks
[38:39.880 --> 38:45.400]  to this desire to have OS 10, but with a more customizable hardware platform underneath it,
[38:45.400 --> 38:52.600]  not just more powerful with a capital P, but also more customizable, truly modular. You're right.
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.400]  The truly modular experience that people haven't had in, in many years. So even though they
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.360]  appreciate the design and the thoughtfulness that went into the Mac pro as it currently exists,
[39:02.360 --> 39:09.880]  I think many people feel that those choices being made for them stands out as an even more
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.720]  irritating decision because of the segment that they're going after. Like how many iMac users,
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.000]  I mean, well, scratch that. There are plenty. Apple users love to complain because they're
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  so attuned to detail, right? The company has taught them to be picky about their stuff.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.960]  That's why they're, that's the base reason that the Mac community, the Apple community
[39:31.960 --> 39:37.160]  is so picky about stuff because they've been trained to care, right? Um, by a company that
[39:37.160 --> 39:44.600]  ostensibly cares. So, but scratching that, setting that aside, the average Mac user, the 80%, let's
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.400]  call it, of the Mac users out there who are like, hey, I just want to, I need a big computer for my
[39:49.400 --> 39:55.080]  desk and I love Apple stuff. What do I get that's not a portable? Oh, we buy an iMac, right? The vast
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.680]  majority of those are not going crazy about like, oh, I can't, you know, change this particular
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.480]  chipset, right? Or whatever. Like I can't get this network card instead of this network card
[40:05.480 --> 40:12.280]  or whatever. But the segment that they did it to was the one that was going to be the most allergic
[40:12.280 --> 40:19.240]  to it in the long run. And like that is another thing that was kind of weird to me. Why, you know,
[40:19.240 --> 40:24.600]  I wonder if there was, I mean, I'm sure there was an advocate inside saying, this is great,
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.000]  but it actually, something like the Mac Pro, imagine if that was the iMac. Now these days,
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.680]  I think the iMac is the right choice. People just buy one thing and they're done. Nobody buys,
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.000]  you know, nobody wants to buy separate monitors. They do it because they have to, right? Like the
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.400]  average person. So I think the iMac is the right configuration. I'm not trying to say that the Mac
[40:41.400 --> 40:47.560]  Pro is right for the normal person, but that segment of the market would have been much more
[40:47.560 --> 40:53.000]  receptive and welcoming, I think, of a thing where it's like, don't worry about it. We thought it all
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.840]  out, right? We've got the perfect sweet capsule for you that's going to do amazing things
[40:58.840 --> 41:04.920]  performance-wise, totally enough for you. Plop this on your desk and plug it in and enjoy.
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.240]  And that segment, I think, is much more receptive and welcoming of that. Whereas the Pro segment is
[41:09.240 --> 41:14.680]  the opposite. The first thing they do is refresh the iFixit page so they see how things tear down
[41:14.680 --> 41:20.520]  and they want to know what's in there and all of that. And they want to be informed consumers.
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.320]  And I think that that leads itself to the desire to have choice and all that stuff. I don't know.
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.040]  It's just the way I see that. They just sort of pitched it to the wrong people. Yeah. I think that
[41:30.040 --> 41:35.560]  there's a continuum of everything, but there's a continuum of people's price sensitivity.
[41:37.320 --> 41:44.600]  But I think that at a certain end, if you talk about college-age students who want a
[41:45.160 --> 41:54.200]  Mac for gaming or want a computer that can dual boot but use a Mac but have a powerful GPU for
[41:54.200 --> 42:01.560]  gaming, are more willing to spend the time to do the Hackintosh and to put up with the
[42:01.560 --> 42:07.560]  incompatibilities and the worries about applying software updates and maybe wait until somebody
[42:07.560 --> 42:11.320]  else decides whether this graphics card is going to work with the latest version of Sierra
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.240]  and all of that versus the professional market where price isn't really the issue. They're
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.280]  begging Apple to charge them a lot of money for a computer. And part of what they're willing to spend
[42:24.280 --> 42:34.280]  money for is the it-just-works factor of getting a real Mac. And I can see why the Hackintosh route
[42:34.280 --> 42:39.320]  is more popular than growing in popularity given the Mac pro stagnation. But I think it's a large
[42:39.320 --> 42:43.640]  part of that. I mean, and clearly, like I said, it's a continuum and there's obvious exceptions.
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.800]  There might be real professional users. There certainly are some who are doing it. But I think
[42:47.800 --> 42:54.680]  for the most part, a real professional user who might be willing to spend $10,000 or $15,000 on
[42:54.680 --> 43:00.040]  a workstation isn't going to do it with unsupported drivers and an unsupported configuration.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.880]  They're the type of people who are like, if I can't get hardware from Apple that meets my
[43:05.880 --> 43:12.280]  needs, I'd rather switch to Windows and get a supported configuration. Whereas the hobbyist
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.160]  community, the hobbyist community has always by definition been self-supporting. They don't need
[43:17.160 --> 43:22.280]  support because they are their own support. Yeah. And whatever configuration they're coming up with,
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.200]  they're getting live, essentially live tech support on it from the community that they're in
[43:28.200 --> 43:32.440]  of those similar people that build those things. Hey, has anybody ever come across this problem?
[43:32.440 --> 43:35.800]  You know, I did it a bunch of times when I was building Hackintoshes where it's like,
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.520]  you know, because I was just too poor to own a really powerful Mac. And so I would just build
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.040]  out of PC parts and then run OS X on it. And, you know, I'm sure Apple's cringing and whatever,
[43:46.040 --> 43:49.480]  but you know, it's what I could afford. And I think a lot of people start out that way,
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.200]  you know, those price sensitive people, but there are also, you know, sort of hacker friendly or
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.920]  whatever you want to call it, who don't mind instability and thinking around because they
[43:58.920 --> 44:05.400]  just lust after the OS X experience and the Apple ecosystem and all of that. But I think that
[44:05.400 --> 44:18.280]  there's like, it's sort of like an entry point for eventual Mac Pro owners, right? And so I know
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.680]  there are other entry points, right? You go to a company and you become a designer and all this,
[44:22.680 --> 44:26.040]  and the company has a corporate budget and what are you going to buy, right? You're going to get
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.920]  your Mac Pro, you're going to be a designer with capital D and do all your design work.
[44:30.920 --> 44:37.400]  And that's great, but I think there's a long tail of people out there that have become pros
[44:38.520 --> 44:43.720]  through alternative pathways, don't have a lot of money to spend, want to get into the ecosystem
[44:43.720 --> 44:51.000]  because they, once again, they love the fact that the company prioritizes design and prioritizes
[44:51.960 --> 44:56.840]  care and all of that in their software. And they know in the end underneath it, you know,
[44:56.840 --> 45:02.040]  the hardware that it runs isn't perhaps as carefully picked and chosen as something Apple
[45:02.040 --> 45:07.640]  would do, but they can get it to run, right? It's just a mishmash of junk, but it sort of runs and
[45:07.640 --> 45:13.640]  you get it running and you feel good about it and you get it hooked on the ecosystem, which is why
[45:13.640 --> 45:17.640]  I always thought that like every once in a while, Apple will take a stab at like trying to shut down
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.640]  Hackintosh projects and things like that. And I was always just like, let it ride. I mean, if it
[45:21.640 --> 45:28.840]  becomes like a major component of your business being stolen, I guess you got to take some legal,
[45:28.840 --> 45:32.520]  and there's also some legal things you have to plant because of trademarks and all that,
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.560]  so that you can have a future court case against Samsung and say, oh yeah, we tried to protect it
[45:37.560 --> 45:42.520]  back then, even with little people. So I get the legal precedent thing, but it's also just like,
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.560]  let it ride because it's like the low simmering entry point to somebody who eventually, once they
[45:47.560 --> 45:54.840]  have the means, is like, yes, build me an amazing Mac, please, Apple, and powerful Mac Pro, and I
[45:54.840 --> 46:00.920]  will buy it. Now I have the means, I'm addicted, I want the power, but I also want OS X, and so on.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.960]  I found that Hackintosh article, by the way, it was by Dan Council.
[46:06.680 --> 46:08.520]  Paste it in the chat here.
[46:08.520 --> 46:15.800]  I'll send you the link. It's Dan Council of Real Mac. Real Mac Software makes lots of great apps.
[46:15.800 --> 46:22.280]  This is not an ad, et cetera, but he wrote an article called Building a Hackintosh Pro,
[46:24.280 --> 46:31.720]  a little earlier back in March. But his reasoning was essentially, they haven't updated the Mac Pro.
[46:31.720 --> 46:37.000]  I need a full-size graphics card for the stuff that I want to do. And so it's not complicated.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.880]  It's not like anybody's angry. Well, I mean, I'm sure some people are angry, but it's not like
[46:41.880 --> 46:50.120]  anybody's really thinking Apple is doing things that are consumer-hostile on purpose. It's just
[46:50.120 --> 46:54.840]  that there are certain needs and wants they have, and Apple didn't glom on to those needs and wants
[46:54.840 --> 47:00.520]  or assign enough importance to them soon enough to catch themselves, so they didn't have this big gap
[47:00.520 --> 47:13.880]  now. Yeah. I think, bottom line, I'm sure someone at Apple could deny it, but I think it seems pretty
[47:13.880 --> 47:20.840]  clear now that at some point in the last three years or so, or maybe starting around three years
[47:20.840 --> 47:26.920]  ago, that Apple sort of took its collective eye off the ball on the Mac, at least on the hardware.
[47:26.920 --> 47:33.160]  I think the software is going fine. I think they're hitting their annual release dates. I
[47:33.160 --> 47:38.520]  think that they're solid. I think they're doing enough cool new things that are very useful,
[47:38.520 --> 47:44.240]  like the continuity stuff I use every day. And I just think, like, how the hell did I ever go
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.320]  from having these links on my iPhone and then switch to another computer to look at them there
[47:49.320 --> 47:57.320]  before this stuff worked? Some great features. I don't think that they should be radically... I
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.920]  think that the complaint some people have about the Mac is that they haven't done anything that's
[48:00.920 --> 48:05.160]  like, here's the radical new way to use a Mac. I don't want that. I mean, obviously, if they came
[48:05.160 --> 48:12.200]  up with something that I liked, I guess I'd like it, but I kind of feel like they've... That's what
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.280]  new products are for, right? That's why the iPad is a different product. Here's a radical new way
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.160]  to do personal computing on a portable device. I still want to do the stuff that the Mac is great
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.200]  at on the Mac. Hardware-wise, though, I think it's hard to deny that they kind of took their
[48:27.200 --> 48:35.040]  eye off the ball. And I think part of this sort of let's hit the reset button mindset is that
[48:35.040 --> 48:42.000]  reaction to the MacBook Pros last fall, I think, was mixed. I don't think... It's fair to say it
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.600]  was a poor reaction, but I do think it was a mixed reaction, and I think that took Apple by surprise.
[48:47.600 --> 48:53.760]  I think Apple internally thought they had a smash hit on their hands and was sort of taken aback by
[48:53.760 --> 49:01.440]  the number of people who expressed displeasure at the decisions they made with the MacBook Pro.
[49:01.440 --> 49:07.920]  And during our discussion, Schiller had, during his opening remarks, addressed it in his usual
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.320]  way where it wasn't quite head on, but it was clear what he... He mentioned them and said that
[49:12.320 --> 49:18.160]  they're hard at work on a next group of MacBook Pros that would address, specifically address,
[49:18.160 --> 49:24.320]  some of the complaints professional users had about the current ones. Although he didn't say
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.440]  any things of what those are, but I would presume... Or maybe he mentioned RAM. Did he mention RAM?
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.920]  I mean, one of the complaints people have about the current MacBook Pros is that they're still...
[49:33.920 --> 49:39.600]  The maximum amount of RAM you can put in them is 16 gigabytes. And the reason it's not 32 gigabytes
[49:39.600 --> 49:45.840]  is because Apple is using... I don't have to write me to tell me, but they're using DDR, whatever,
[49:46.560 --> 49:55.280]  low energy RAM. And on the current Intel chipset, if you're using the kind of low energy battery
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.000]  saving RAM that Apple wants to use to keep battery life good, the maximum you can get is 16.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.680]  So they could, in theory, have MacBook Pros that have 32 gigabytes, but it would involve
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.360]  a complete re-architecture of which Intel chipset they're using. And to ship them last year,
[50:11.360 --> 50:17.280]  they would have not been able to use the low energy RAM. And we went through this when the
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.040]  MacBook Pros came out. And the answer from the people who are RAM starved in their professional
[50:23.040 --> 50:29.040]  work, who really need more than 16, or at least want, if not needs more than 16 gigabytes of RAM,
[50:29.040 --> 50:35.040]  is, I don't care about the low energy. I'll plug the goddamn thing in. I just want 32 gigabytes of
[50:35.040 --> 50:44.400]  RAM, which is a completely reasonable trade-off. It is completely reasonable for a Mac user who
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.360]  gets the Mac and loves the Mac. It's not like, oh, if you were a real Mac user, you'd see the
[50:49.360 --> 50:55.360]  genius of Apple's decision in this regard. I could totally see how there are totally long-time,
[50:55.360 --> 50:59.920]  diehard Mac users who get and love the Mac who are willing to say, I would rather get
[51:00.640 --> 51:06.560]  eight hours of battery life instead of 10 if I could get 32 gigabytes of RAM in this machine
[51:06.560 --> 51:12.000]  instead of 16. Totally reasonable. I think the number of people who took that stance,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.920]  though, took Apple by surprise. I mean, it's not that RAM is the only issue,
[51:17.520 --> 51:19.600]  the complaint that people have about the MacBook Pros.
[51:19.600 --> 51:29.200]  But, yeah, well, then, so there's two things that I think that are important to touch. And I think
[51:29.200 --> 51:32.240]  the touch thing we should talk about, because I think that's very interesting. And you mentioned
[51:32.240 --> 51:38.080]  iPad. But the other branch of that discussion is, you mentioned how many people, it took them by
[51:38.080 --> 51:44.000]  surprise, how many people did that. So it sort of begs the question, why did it take them by
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.600]  surprise? Why did it sneak up on them, so to speak? Well, like I said, the best phrase I
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.880]  can come up with is that they took their eye off the ball a bit and sort of got a little too
[51:56.880 --> 52:04.640]  insular. I mean, I think it's often the biggest risk to Apple is that they're so insular as a
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.600]  culture that they can lose sight, even if they think they're keeping track of the community.
[52:09.600 --> 52:14.800]  And I think they certainly try to. But I think that they could talk themselves into
[52:16.880 --> 52:21.600]  just taking their eye off the ball, specifically taking their eye off the ball of the needs of
[52:21.600 --> 52:27.520]  larger chunks of their users. That's what I think they took their eye off the ball on. And I think
[52:27.520 --> 52:33.200]  that there are so many things to really love about the new MacBook Pro that I think that they somehow
[52:33.200 --> 52:40.080]  got caught up loving the things there are to love about them and lost sight of the ways that it was
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.680]  falling short of some of their professionals' needs. What were you going to say about touch
[52:45.680 --> 52:52.880]  in that regard? So the thing that they mentioned essentially was if you want touch, buy an iPad
[52:52.880 --> 52:57.280]  and use it together. And we're going to work on ways to make those work better or think about
[52:57.280 --> 53:03.440]  ways to make those work better together or whatever. Which says to me that they not want,
[53:03.440 --> 53:09.360]  this is not the primary purpose of it, but that the iPad Pro, they want it to act like a Cintiq
[53:09.360 --> 53:16.640]  tablet of sorts that connects to a Mac Pro or iMac or whatever in a more seamless fashion,
[53:16.640 --> 53:24.320]  which makes a hell of a ton of sense. Because the pen tracking and things like that Apple feels
[53:24.320 --> 53:33.840]  is superior to things like the Surface Studio and the Cintiqs. It's quite obvious. The Cintiq
[53:33.840 --> 53:38.320]  tablets, which are made by Wacom, are sort of like the de facto industry standard. And a designer
[53:38.320 --> 53:45.520]  that earns enough money to spend $1,500, $2,000 on it is basically they're buying a PC with a
[53:45.520 --> 53:50.880]  touch screen glued to the front of it. And they lay it flat. If you're not a designer, they lay
[53:50.880 --> 53:55.920]  it flat, then use the stylus directly on it, therefore directly drawing a line on the screen.
[53:55.920 --> 54:01.040]  It was like an iPad Pro before an iPad Pro, I guess. I don't know. Just to analogize it
[54:01.040 --> 54:06.720]  through a backwards lens. But the Cintiqs for many years ruled the roost with designers.
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.440]  And now I have this, I'm sure you do too, but just because I do happen to do a lot in Apple stuff,
[54:13.440 --> 54:23.600]  when I'm looking at pictures, even in completely unrelated articles or media, I'm looking at
[54:23.600 --> 54:30.400]  desks. I always look at desks and workspaces. I'm fascinated with workspaces, from machinists to
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.960]  designers to anything else. I think there's a lot of fascinating things to learn about a person
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.280]  by the way that they handle their workspace, how messy it is or how clean it is, neither of which
[54:41.280 --> 54:45.840]  are bad necessarily. It's just the person, right? It's how they move through life.
[54:45.840 --> 54:52.560]  You made a keen observation last week, because our meeting was held in what they call the
[54:53.280 --> 55:00.160]  machine shop, but it's their design realization lab, where they take designs that I guess are
[55:00.160 --> 55:10.240]  like CAD or just prototypes. And it's a machine shop where they take ideas for designs and try to
[55:10.240 --> 55:16.400]  turn them into as realistic an approximation of what it would actually be like as a real Apple
[55:16.400 --> 55:23.040]  product as possible. And I got the feeling that a lot of that stuff was just so that they could
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.240]  wing it around and hold it and open and close, open and close, open and close it, and see how a
[55:28.240 --> 55:33.120]  human is like, oh, this feels really awkward now that I hold it. Make it as real as possible.
[55:33.120 --> 55:38.720]  But you made the keen observation, looking around, and they had some stuff covered with black drapes
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.440]  and they obviously had shut down for the day. They said, ordinarily, this is a very noisy facility
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.480]  for obvious reasons. But you made the keen observation, I thought, that you could kind
[55:48.480 --> 55:56.080]  of see that some of the benches and stuff and the machines were from different people who work there
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.880]  because they were set up in very different ways. That there's somebody who works at this spot and
[56:00.880 --> 56:07.200]  that the person who works right across this aisle from them is a different person because their
[56:07.200 --> 56:10.240]  tools were laid out in a different way. And I thought that was pretty interesting.
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.480]  Yeah, I mean, I'm hypersensitive to that. I came from my grandfather was a machinist and my dad is
[56:17.680 --> 56:23.360]  a craftsman. He's a painter, fine art painter now, but he for many years was, and still does,
[56:23.360 --> 56:27.360]  worked on cars and all kinds of other stuff. Got the same inclination, obviously, from his dad.
[56:27.360 --> 56:32.720]  I mean, I'm a dummy when it comes to that stuff. I can get my way around. But their workspace is
[56:32.720 --> 56:44.000]  always fascinated with me. My grandfather had a cabinet or whatever, which he built himself
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.880]  because he's a machinist so he worked in wood as well. And wood was like butter to him after
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.800]  working on aircraft parts all day. And so we built this cabinet with these wooden drawers.
[56:54.800 --> 57:00.640]  And there was maybe, I don't know, 50 or 60 wooden drawers. And each one had a different kind of
[57:00.640 --> 57:07.040]  thing in it. You go like, oh, I need a washer, like a split lock washer. And he's like, oh,
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.680]  right here. And you look in and there's a bunch of split lock washers. And they're not new.
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.520]  They're reclaimed. They got a little bit of oil and grit on them, but they're fine. They're fine.
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.600]  And he puts them back there and that way you know, hey, I got to fix this thing under the sink or
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.120]  whatever. He came from that generation where it's like, I'm going to fix this thing. I'm going to go
[57:25.120 --> 57:28.080]  out, pull out a drawer, grab this thing and put it in. I'm not going to go to the store and buy
[57:28.080 --> 57:34.800]  a whole new faucet or whatever. And he's also not going to jury rig it with an ill-fitting part and
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.720]  just sort of strap it together with a rag to stop the dripping. He's going to have the exact washer
[57:40.720 --> 57:46.880]  that you need to make a complete, you know, make the right fit right there. Right. Exactly. And
[57:46.880 --> 57:53.040]  the same thing with the tools, you know, all of the, like a punch or a pair of pliers or a clamp
[57:53.040 --> 58:00.400]  or anything like that. It's all laid out, all kind of had its own place. Used, worn, grimy, whatever,
[58:00.400 --> 58:05.360]  but there. Right. And organized in some way too, according to his brain. And I just saw that
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.080]  reflected on the workspaces. And I'm not like, you know, this is the same in machine shops around the
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.960]  world. So I'm not trying to say that Apple is some sort of, you know, crazy special place. I just
[58:14.960 --> 58:21.440]  found it really nice to see because it says, hey, these are craftsmen. A lot of people think about
[58:21.440 --> 58:27.520]  this like Johnny designs it and some thing prints it out, you know, overseas and that's it. But,
[58:27.520 --> 58:33.120]  you know, I think it is very important for us to remember that as, you know, Steve said,
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.080]  these are, you know, the world is made up of people who are no smarter than you, then they
[58:38.080 --> 58:43.120]  made all these things, you know. All it is is they applied themselves, you know, they put the effort
[58:43.120 --> 58:50.720]  into learning how to do this. And so you see those wooden work boxes there with their measuring tools
[58:50.720 --> 58:56.960]  and punches and filing tools and those things all laid out in different bits for their CNC machines,
[58:56.960 --> 59:02.400]  for the cutting machines, and all of that stuff laid out. And you could tell like a man or woman
[59:02.400 --> 59:09.440]  works here, you know, and they live in this space. Yeah, exactly. And so while the machines
[59:09.440 --> 59:15.360]  themselves may have the overall personality of somebody, you know, a lot of man hours and woman
[59:15.360 --> 59:20.720]  hours, whatever you want to call it, I hate that term, man hours, but they went into it. And it definitely
[59:21.760 --> 59:27.040]  was reflected in the workspaces, you know, which I found compelling. But, anyhow, I digress. But
[59:27.040 --> 59:31.520]  like from the workspaces thing, I'm seeing more and more and more and more designers' workspaces,
[59:31.520 --> 59:38.480]  they'll have whatever computer, a Mac or a PC or whatever. Invariably, though, iPad Pro and a
[59:38.480 --> 59:43.200]  pencil, like everywhere. Like I was reading an article about Nike the other day, designing some
[59:43.200 --> 59:49.520]  shoe because I'm a shoe fanatic. And on the table in the background, iPad Pro and a pencil, right?
[59:49.520 --> 59:56.000]  And I think it's sort of gaining a lot of traction in that industry and in that field. And Apple sees
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.800]  this as an opening for them to go, hey, we can serve these customers who have traditionally
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.840]  been very Apple centric, and we can hopefully not lose them, but at the same time hold to our
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.000]  beliefs, which from their discussion during our talk there, they still very strongly believe that
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.320]  touch does not belong on that huge vertical monitor. And so this is a way that they can
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.680]  sort of serve both of those. And as Craig joked, also allows them to sell more products.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.000]  Yeah, they do. And they're very upfront about that, that they like it when people
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.680]  buy lots of Apple products. The person who is a recent iPad convert because of the iPad Pro
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.960]  and pencil who I found fascinating, and it was exactly what I suspected is Jonathan Heffler
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:51.680]  of Heffler & Company, the typographers. And a friend of the show, icon designer, icon artist
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:59.120]  and graphic designer, illustrator extraordinaire, Louis Mancha, is getting into creating his own
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:08.560]  typefaces. And like any super artistic person, it's not like he's so talented. I mean, he can
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.960]  draw illustrations, he can make icons, he can do logos, and he's drawing typefaces. And put one up
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.120]  like A through Z specimen up and asked Heffler for his thoughts. And Heffler, rather than just
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:30.160]  tweet his response, like, took it and marked it up with a just a slew of thoughts and just little
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.760]  details and parts of a B that maybe should be the mirror image of the D. You know, like a B in a
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.800]  lowercase B and D and other areas where you think like as a kid, you grow up thinking, oh, a B and
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.640]  a D are just mirror images. Well, sometimes you want them to be and sometimes you don't. And with
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.200]  explanations of why, you know, maybe you'd want to take a bigger chunk out of this, or you want
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:58.320]  to have this be curved or this piece. I found it as a fan of typography who does not have the
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.720]  artistic ability to create typography in any way, shape or form. Like there's no chance that I could
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.920]  make a good looking typeface none, but I can appreciate a good typeface. And I'd like to think
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.320]  at least that I can appreciate the difference between a good typeface and a great typeface.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.080]  And I found his markup to be fascinating from a typographic level. But then I was also interested
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.760]  in how did he make this mock-up? And he was like, of course you would ask. And he said that it on
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.640]  Twitter, Heffler said that he switched, he got an iPad Pro like a year ago and took to it. And I
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.680]  forget which app he's using, but it's like, I think it's like PDF Pro, PDF expert, one of the
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:48.640]  third-party PDF markup apps. And that it was so good for him that he got iPad Pros for the entire
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:57.520]  company and they switched their entire critique process for typefaces from paper to PDFs. And it
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.720]  was all specifically, it never could have happened before the iPad Pro and pencil and that they're
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.600]  a loving it. They're way more efficient and B they're saving like 8,000 sheets of paper a day.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:15.120]  I don't know what exactly he said, but it was, you can imagine how many,
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.320]  a company full of type designers who do lots of critiques and lots of iterations over and over
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.560]  and over again on every letter that they're saving an awful lot of paper. And they've got,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.480]  now they've got a paper trail of the evolution of a typeface that is electronically searchable and
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.840]  doesn't need to be archived in filing cabinets or something like that. Anyway,
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:41.200]  I thought that was interesting. Yeah. I mean, as a long time, I come from a family of artists and I
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.960]  never fully went down that path. There was a brief period where I thought I was going to be
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.160]  a fine artist. And I went into, I went more into the photographic side of things, but I did take
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:58.960]  all of the required drawing classes, life drawing, et cetera. So I could still sketch you a reclining
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:06.800]  nude if you want one. But that process of pencil to paper, the way everybody holds a pencil,
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.880]  every artist holds one slightly differently, different angle, different inflection,
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.320]  and it feels organic and natural to them. And a typical stylist requires that you have a fairly
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:23.280]  precise, specific angle on it to make it react to the surface in a certain way. And the pencil
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.160]  doesn't. I mean, within a certain bounds, you can't go as extreme as you can with a pencil,
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.560]  but you can go a lot more extreme because of the way that they built it and the way, of course,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.200]  that they built the screen to match it. Whereas most people are working with a fairly standard
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.280]  touchscreen and then mating whatever, you know, swizzle they can get in a stylist to it to try
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.120]  and make it feel more organic. You know, you've seen the ones with the little disks at the tip
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.160]  so that you could see what's under the stylus and all that. But it's really the hold of the pencil
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.960]  that is the most important thing. And I find it amazing that you can, you know, do a four finger
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.680]  hold on a pencil and shade and then you can flip it and do a standard stylus type hold and so on
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:10.080]  and so forth. And I think that that organic way that those work coupled with the very incredibly
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:17.440]  low latency on the screen are just selling people on it the moment that they try it or can figure
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.000]  out a way to work it into their workflow. And I think that if they if Apple can leverage that
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.080]  and use that as a way to say, you don't need touch because you've already got all the touch you need
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.880]  here. I think that, you know, it could work. It could work for the Mac Pro.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.560]  All right, I've looked it up. I've got it in the show notes, but I've got the whole thread
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:41.760]  on Twitter of this typeface critique and the app that Heffler and his company are using
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.840]  specifically is Notability. Notability or is it Notability Pro? Notability app,
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:54.800]  which he describes as the only app that he's ever felt feels like a real pen to him. So anyway,
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.400]  it's a great app. I do have it. I don't really have a need for it like he does. But
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.680]  boy, that's great. And I agree with what you said. I really do. It did come up, though,
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.040]  it came up at the meeting as to whether they're over working on touch screen. Max, I feel like
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.840]  it's the question that will never go away. Until one day they find out a way to do it. And then
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.000]  everybody says see and then like, well, you know, we were just waiting or what I don't think they
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.360]  will. I really don't. I think that they could do it and shut people up. But I feel like it's a bad
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:32.000]  idea. Let's hold that thought. And I'll explain why I think it really is a bad idea. And I don't
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.280]  think I think some people suspect that it's Oh, they know touch is the future. And they just want
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.240]  people to this it's all hinges on this theory that they that they quote unquote want everybody
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:49.280]  to use a MacBook Pro or iPad Pro, use an iPad Pro. And so they're starving the Mac of touch
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:55.040]  screens out of spite to encourage people to buy iPad Pros, which I think is nonsense.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.240]  But I think that's the working theory of the otherwise it makes no sense why the Mac has no
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.920]  touchscreen. Whereas I think that they're great. I think what Apple is saying about the Mac and
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:14.240]  touchscreen is the literal truth that it's a bad combination of form factor and and UI design.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:24.400]  Anyway, let me take a break though. And thank our next sponsor. It is Hello hu ll Oh, hello pillow.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.360]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow? They are totally different than the fluffy soft pillows
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:35.840]  most of us are used to. It's similar to a beanbag, which allows you to adjust its shape and thickness.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.920]  I've been using a hello pillow. We actually have two of them one on each side of the bed.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:48.480]  I like mine. And I like it a lot. My wife actually comes back when we come back from vacations. She
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.840]  actually complains that she actually misses that's how much she misses her hello pillow. We go away
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:02.720]  for a week and she's like, Oh my god, I'm like, she's totally no longer like sleeping on even on
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:09.840]  a really nice bed without a hello pillow. We've had it's got to be at least a year maybe longer.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:16.000]  And it's I can't imagine what it was like without it. We really like them. Here's what it's like.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.640]  It's like a beanbag. It's very heavy for a pillow heavy for a pillow at least it supports your head
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.160]  and neck how you want it and unlike traditional squishy soft pillows which collapse under the
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:33.920]  weight of your head. Hello pillows hold their form. It also stays cool and dry compared to
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.480]  pillows fed with feathers or foam because there's air between these little buckwheat
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.720]  husks that are that are sort of are the quote unquote beans in the beanbag.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.440]  No matter what happens there remains air in there and it keeps stuff flowing and so it doesn't get
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.280]  hot. It's really great. Ours have been like I said, we've had them for at least a year they
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.480]  last great. It doesn't seem like it's any different than it was when it was brand new.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.600]  It's really great. Do you use two pillows or fold your pillow in an attempt for proper support? Well
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.840]  that's a sign that your pillow isn't firm or thick enough. Hello pillow support allows you to keep
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:15.840]  your head up with just one pillow. It's very true. It's very different than a regular pillow.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.800]  You're going to open a box. You're going to say it really is like a beanbag and you're going to
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.480]  think there is no way that this thing is actually going to be a good pillow because it is so unlike
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.680]  a traditional fluffy pillow. Here's the deal though. They're so confident on it. They're
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:37.200]  going to give you a 60 night guarantee. So go ahead and try it. That's it. Hello pillow.com

[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  What were we talking about? I always forget.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:27.040]  Oh, touch screen max. I get into it. I get into it. That's the secret. I get hypnotized
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:37.360]  by my own sponsor. So think about like the one that and I'm not saying it's a bad design,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.880]  but I feel like the trade offs are too much. So people are, you know, talking about the
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:51.360]  the windows surface style tablets where the you can dock it to a keyboard part
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.640]  and then you can undock it somehow. And then the screen is a standalone tablet
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:06.320]  with a separate processor and its own little battery. It is to me, it's a worse tablet than
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.880]  an iPad because it's it's it can't have it's not doesn't have a full strength processor. The full
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:21.120]  strength processor is in the base, but it's so it's worse as a tablet, but it's also worse as
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:27.360]  a laptop because then the screen of the laptop when it's in laptop mode is thicker, especially
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:34.080]  compared to the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros like one of the best little things. And it's like,
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.760]  I can write about it, but I don't feel like it's ever convincing to someone until they actually
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:44.880]  try it for a while is how much nicer the screen opens on a Mac on the latest MacBook Pros. Like
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.640]  I'm still using as my daily driver, I still have a two and a half year old 13 inch MacBook Pro from
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:57.120]  the previous design. And it's still suits my needs because on a day to day basis, the iMac is my main
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.000]  computer. And it's this is and I max the do what I tend to do with my max is when I do buy a new
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.960]  one, I just max it out, I get the fastest and I get the most RAM and I get the biggest SSD,
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.080]  and then use it for years until I feel like I really need a new computer and then max one out
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.280]  again, rather than upgrade like every year or so to a mid range computer or something like that.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.160]  I think of everything else on the new after getting those review units of the new MacBook
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.560]  Pros, the thing that I miss the most isn't the touch bar. And it isn't touch ID, although touch
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:38.400]  ID is close. It's the the way that it opens and closes. That's it's so light, the screen is so
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:44.880]  light and thin, and the hinge is so much better, that it's just effortless. It always goes, it just
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.520]  lifts the bass never comes up when you lift it, the bass never right shift, sloppy place thing,
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:56.640]  the poppy bass syndrome was like, it was always a huge issue for me on what airs in the Mac books.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.440]  I just got used to I used an 11 inch MacBook Air for years and liked it in so many ways. And
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.520]  I just had it out recently to do a battery test on it. And I still love the form factor when it's
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.120]  closed. But opening and closing it is sort of a two hand operation or a pinch finger operation
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:21.440]  because it's just like you said, a floppy base. The new MacBook Pros have the best feel of a
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.840]  laptop opening and closing of any device I've ever seen in my life. But the the part of that,
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.400]  though, is that the screen part, the part that you move up and down, if you could magically detach
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.800]  that it's way too thin to be a tablet, it wouldn't have any room for a battery, it's way too thin and
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.600]  light. There's no way that that could be a tablet. And if you wanted to turn it into a tablet, you'd
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.280]  end up with a device with a totally different balance of weight, and, and etc, etc, almost
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.040]  inverted, really, because the keyboard would be on the bottom. And that's it. Well, and that's it.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.760]  And that has struck me with the iPad Pro with a smart keep keyboard like I get it if you to me
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.360]  that that configuration of using an iPad with a smart keyboard, or even a third party like a
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:12.720]  Logitech keyboard with a, you know, click click keys is so top heavy, I can see it if if if your
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.800]  goal is I love my iPad so much that I want to use it for more stuff. And I want to use it for writing
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.840]  and so for, you know, writing, I want to have a real hardware keyboard there, you know, therefore
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.040]  being able to do it and do it with a smart connector for the ease of, you know, hooking it
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:36.160]  up and unhooking it up. That's great. But it's so inferior just as a laptop compared to a real
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.200]  MacBook Pro, like putting the software aside and your preference for iOS over Mac OS or vice
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:47.280]  versa, just the art, the action of opening and closing it and putting it away. You can't beat
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:54.080]  the MacBook Pro with with a tablet that docks to a keyboard. Right? It's like you could, you could
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:02.160]  have your MacBook Pro open, close it, realize you forgot to do one last thing, reopen it. And
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.480]  especially if you're using the Apple Watch to unlock it or use touch ID, be logged back in
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.440]  before somebody else could close up an iPad Pro and get the smart keyboard folded up. It's, you
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:21.040]  know, again, I'm not saying that it means iPad Pro with a smart keyboard or a Logitech keyboard
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:27.200]  is a bad design, but it certainly is a huge trade-off in terms of just the art of opening
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:33.360]  and closing the laptop. And so I just don't see it. I'm curious to see, so like me,
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.560]  I've had a couple of the Surfaces, I've had the Surface Pro 3 and the Surface Pro 4,
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.160]  and I found them to be, you know, interesting devices that just really got schizophrenic in
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.200]  the software. So like the hardware wasn't, you know, the Surface Pro 3 was okay. The 4 was better
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.200]  hardware-wise, not too bad. The software was just super schizophrenic because it was trying to be
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.200]  two things at once. You know, it's trying to be touch and mouse and all of that and mashed into
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.960]  one, which is Apple's constant refrain that they don't want to run into that problem. And I agree,
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:11.280]  having used, you know, Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 4, it just, it still felt really schizophrenic
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.080]  to me. And I don't think that it's unusable, right? So I think there are plenty of people
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.520]  out there that can get used to it. I am very curious though, people are saying, hey, you know,
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.160]  Surfaces are selling more devices. Obviously, their quarterly reports show that they have
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.880]  something there, right? There's something there that people like. And maybe that is the pitch of
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.200]  having the all-in-one so they don't have to buy a tablet and a computer. You know, that marketing
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.000]  is working and then people get the devices and they like them enough to keep them. And so that's
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.680]  working. But I'm very curious to see what will happen one generation out when people go, man,
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.280]  how exhausting was using that? You know, how exhausting was this constant being caught in
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.960]  between two worlds? And so I think Microsoft has an opportunity right now, this sort of
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.680]  gap of time where they've got a little traction and it's going well. And so the positive word of
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.000]  mouth is causing more and more people to try that, that paradigm out where they have a chance to
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.600]  figure it out and maybe they can, right? Maybe they can suss something out and they figure it
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.080]  out. And it's like, oh, wow, this really hits the mark. And the Surface Book obviously is a
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:19.440]  nod to that. They're trying to swizzle, trying to find their niche to put that claw in. And that's
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.800]  great. But I think that Apple looks at that and goes, why would we do that when we have these
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.880]  two more pure devices that we feel service just different needs completely? And that's our
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.000]  philosophy. Like hit these nails straight rather than trying to hit the nail in an angle to try
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.160]  and catch both boards or whatever. Yeah. And I think it fits with Apple's philosophy of,
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:47.920]  we're not going to create enough devices to cover every possible desire. We're going to have a
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:55.040]  fewer number of devices and hopefully have them meet almost everybody's needs. And it almost
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:02.320]  comes back to the fact that I suspect that there might've been an inkling two years ago to a year
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.960]  ago where maybe they thought they could even get rid of the Mac Pro and just have iMacs and MacBook
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:13.200]  Pros. If anything, I think that they were leaning towards having fewer configurations of Macs than
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:21.680]  adding more by adding something like a Surface Studio. And that gets us, I've said this before
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.960]  many times, but there's all sorts of things on screen on a Mac that just are not conducive to
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:36.720]  touch just in terms of how big they are. And I've done it and I know people feel, I get a lot of
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:44.640]  email about this, but I've done it myself. I am an anti-screen toucher. I liked it. I generally,
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:52.160]  I will sometimes buy a new MacBook and it might go hopefully many, many months before any human
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:19:00.000]  being ever touches the display. Right. Yeah. I'm a hover hander myself. I don't like to stab my
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.680]  screen. It makes me very nervous. People might get nervous. There was a scene in The Walking Dead
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.800]  this week where, without revealing anything, any spoilers, but there was a character threatening
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.960]  another character by holding a knife very, very close to this character's eyeball for a very long
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:23.920]  time. They had to have done it with computer graphics because there's no way it looked too
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:29.040]  convincing. But it was very nerve wracking to see a character with a knife held right in front of
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.200]  his open eyeball during a threatening situation for a long period of time. That's how I feel when
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.400]  I see somebody reach towards a non-touch display with a finger. Right. To try and point at a
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:45.040]  document or something. Yeah. I get nervous as soon as they start pointing. I would rather,
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.960]  and the thing is, my touch phobia with screens goes even further. I would rather not clean it
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.600]  than touch it. Is that weird? My screens, I often have, I open up my MacBook and go,
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.600]  wow. This has like, maybe it's sneeze residue, maybe it's dust. I don't know. Eventually it gets
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.600]  bad enough to where you have to clean it, but I'd almost rather not touch it because then I'm afraid
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.280]  I'm going to clean it and it's going to be spongy at the corners. It's just a no-win scenario.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.480]  In my days as a graphic designer, I remember I would work with people who were screen-touchers
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.280]  themselves. This is back in the CRT era. And they would, you know, we'd be like,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.720]  hey, let me show you this. What do you think about this? And they'd start pointing to the
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.480]  screen and touching it. And I'd be like, what are you doing? It's your screen. Why are you touching
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:42.720]  your screen? Big smeary snail trails across it. All right. All that said, back when the first
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.240]  iPad Pro came out and I had a review unit and I did what I tried to always do is immerse myself
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.760]  in it by doing as much of my computing on it as possible during the review period, including
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:21:00.000]  writing the review itself, using it. And then when I was done, like a day later or so, I was
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.680]  using my MacBook Pro and I went over and I tried to scroll. I remember exactly which app it was.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.040]  It was Tweetbot. And I think the fact that Tweetbot sort of shares an aesthetic with the iOS
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:17.440]  version helped me in. I touched my MacBook Pro screen and tried to scroll it. So I get it. If it
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.800]  happened to me, I could see how it could happen to more people where they just want to scroll
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:29.440]  by touching the screen or whatever. But you can't. And I get it. It's not pretty though.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.320]  It's just not pretty. Like, I mean, in terms of the physical interaction, it's not pretty.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.160]  I've seen it happen. Like I've even been like at events and stuff and I've seen people with
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.320]  touchscreen Macs or whatever and they're hurrying to file, like a reporter, and they're hurrying
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.960]  to file their story and they're bashing away and maybe they go to close up or whatever and
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.480]  they're trying to do a couple last things. Or even if they're like reading news while they're
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.880]  doing it and they're scrolling, they reach up and they do this sort of thing where they're
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.840]  pulling the laptop in and half closing it and using the screen with their thumbs. Like stuff
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:08.240]  like that, which I look at it and go, you know, I get it. It's kind of nice to be able to have this dual
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.760]  mode thing where you're like clickety clackety clickety clack. And then if there's a big touch
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.880]  target and you want to just touch it really quick, or perhaps like some interactions might
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.840]  make sense, like swiping on the screen to move an entire desktop space, right? Like that makes a ton
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.280]  of sense to me, logically, you know, philosophically. But just going like hunt. I've seen them also
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.600]  hunting to try and click buttons that they really should have clicked with the mouse, but the touch
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.120]  pads are so shitty on those particular computers or they don't have a mouse, right? That they're
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:42.800]  just like, right? And then, you know, you hit the target wrong because the thumb isn't really
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.760]  calculated to hit it right and all of this stuff. You know, they don't do what Apple does to offset
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.320]  the target, you know, all of that. And remember, there's not a predictable angle that they're
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:58.160]  hitting it from, you know, because it's a laptop screen. With your phone, Apple has offset the key
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.760]  targets. So where they're not over the keys, they're actually slightly above the keys because
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.680]  of the parallax, the way you look at it and the way you type on it. And so when people go whack
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.440]  it, they don't realize they're hitting above the key, but it's still hitting the key. And like that
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.200]  kind of thing they can't do because it's unpredictable how people are going to touch them.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.080]  So I think there's a lot of hurdles that manifest themselves in the weird gymnastics people do when
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.480]  they start actually interacting with those kinds of screens. You know, especially laptops, you whack
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.600]  it and it tilts backwards and flops back down and all this stuff, you know?
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.280]  Right. You'd almost want to build one that probably has more resistance than the current
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:34.720]  MacBook Pros. Resistance in the terms of resistance to whether it moves, not in the
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:42.080]  electrical sense. There's also a kind of a fundamental difference between tapping and
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.720]  clicking. Like when you just, if you had a touchscreen Mac and you just touch the screen
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:52.720]  and then start dragging, did that touch count as a click and then a drag? Or is it just,
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.760]  that's just where you start dragging. And if you think about that, it's totally different
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.240]  both ways, but you would want, sometimes you'd want one and sometimes you'd want the other. Like
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:11.440]  how, how do you differentiate between scrolling in a finder window full of icons and by touching
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:18.400]  and moving your finger and dragging an icon so you can drag and drop by touching and dragging.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.200]  It's the exact same gesture. You put your finger on the screen and it happens to be on top of an
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.760]  icon and you move it. Does it start dragging or does it start scrolling the view of icons?
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.000]  Right. It's, there's two things that you want the same gesture to do. And on the, with the
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.360]  mouse pointer, it's, it's easily solved because it only does the drag. If you click before you move,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.840]  uh, it, you know, it's all sorts of problems that open up like that and it all gets very messy.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.720]  And I feel like most of the people who are kind of hoping that Apple would do this, haven't really
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.080]  thought through any of those issues and, and would be at least in some ways would be dissatisfied
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.440]  with the result because they'd re they would see it as sloppy. Whereas it, it's really not,
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.480]  it's there's no, there is no easy solution to it. There's no way to make putting your finger on the
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:14.160]  screen and dragging it, do both scroll the view and drag and drop the item, you know, and iOS gets
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.320]  away with it by not having dragon. We'll just going to not do that. Uh, yeah. And that's the
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.920]  thing they could do by burning it down, so to speak, right. The interface, the layer.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.640]  And there's things like onto iOS where maybe they're going to do drag and drop because now
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:35.600]  they're adding the haptic engine and you can get a touch and drag and a click and drag on the iOS.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.640]  But even if you thought, well, that's, then there's your solution for, uh, Mac OS for
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.480]  a touch screen, but now you're making the top of the Mac book even thicker than it was already.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.640]  Another layer of thickness you're adding, which is all problematic. And if you want to be able
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.360]  to press it hard enough to get a 3d touch, you've got to make the, you know, the hinge has to be
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.160]  even firmer, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I don't want to go down this route any further, but
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.920]  I think, I think it's a bad idea and I think it's a rabbit hole, right? It really is. And you,
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.440]  once you start going down it, you find yourself mixing metaphors. And I think that's, that's
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.840]  something that's Apple super allergic to. Like if you have a touch metaphor that works on the iPad,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.400]  why would you introduce a completely separate metaphor for the same exact action on a desktop
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.720]  machine? And the answer, of course, the easy answer is, oh, because the desktop's different,
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.600]  but I don't think Apple views it that way. I think they view it, well, if it's different,
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.520]  then why are you trying to like shoehorn this inner, this interaction methodology onto it?
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.320]  And I think that's, that's where they, they don't want two different answers for what happens when I
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.160]  touch things, you know, they just want one answer. And I think that's, that's the kind of the key
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:54.480]  there. Right. And I feel like the way, like part of the brilliance of the original iPhone design
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:02.880]  design was that they, they had, I'm sure tire whiteboards full of these issues to resolve
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.040]  over what happens when you just touch, what happens when you drag, what happens,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.240]  you know, and came up with, okay, this is what will happen when you do this. This is what you
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.040]  happen when you do that. And came up with an overall design that when you presented it to
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.000]  a normal person, they didn't realize any of those things had been designed, that it all
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.840]  felt natural that, yes, this is just, you just put your finger on the screen and swipe it and it
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.520]  starts dragging the view and et cetera, et cetera. You know, you just touch the button and let go
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:41.920]  and the button is activated. Right. Yeah. I don't know. I think they're, they're going to ask,
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.400]  walk into a world of hurt if they start saying different things happen when you touch different
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:54.240]  things simply because they have come so far instructing people on the one-to-one, you know,
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.800]  then the one, the one-to-one is like their mantra, you know, and it was, it's something that they
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:05.520]  didn't invent, but they did perfect and popularize. And I think that that is, you don't want to give
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.680]  up ownership of that by going, oh, just kidding. That's not actually what we believe. Yeah. You're
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.560]  walking into a problem there. All right. I don't believe fundamentally, I do not believe that all
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:23.360]  computers should be touchscreens. I think most should be, and I think most clearly already are,
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.880]  because I think you should count phones as touchscreens or as computers and overwhelm,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.280]  if you combine iPhones and Android phones, it's, you know, it's over, they overwhelm all the other
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.960]  personal computers and use in the world today, let alone tablets and anything else that might
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.440]  have a touchscreen, but I don't think all should, I think there's a place for a non-touchscreen
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:51.040]  mouse and keyboard interface. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, intersects with the whole
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.720]  other discussion about voice, but that's literally a whole other, that's a whole other thing.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.240]  Let me take one last break here and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:08.480]  longtime friends of the show, Backblaze. Backblaze offers unlimited native backup for your Mac
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:14.800]  or PC. No credit card required to get started. No risk. You get a 15 day free trial at backblaze.com
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:22.240]  slash during fireball. All data is backed up. Uh, all data on your computer's backed up. That's
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.200]  how much data is backed up. What do you say? Well, I not mine. I have a four terabyte external drive.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.920]  Nope. They'll back it all up. Only hitch is it. Well, however much data you have to back up on
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:38.800]  your computer, however long it takes to upload through your home internet or your office
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.280]  internet, it just takes longer to get, to get the initial backup up there. That's it. That's
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:52.800]  the only hit. There is no catch. Uh, you pay $5 per Mac per month, unlimited data. Uh, the software
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.280]  is terrific. It's written or the Mac version is written by former Apple engineers and it feels
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.720]  like it. It's seamless in the background. You never notice it running. Uh, you just set it up
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:08.240]  and forget it. And it's there and you get the peace of mind, the wonderful, wonderful,
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.560]  you'll sleep an extra hour a night with the peace of mind of knowing that everything on your Mac
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.440]  that's important is backed up to the cloud. Is it, should that be the only way you back up? No.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.200]  Backblaze will be the first to tell you that there's a great place in your back flows,
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:26.080]  backup solution for something like time machine, uh, something like super duper to clone your
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.680]  startup disks so that you have a second external drive with a complete clone of your startup disk
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:37.040]  that you could just switch to and boot from and have go back to local stuff is great. It's always
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:42.800]  going to be faster. Uh, but for when disaster strikes, like if somebody, uh, breaks into your
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:49.680]  house and steals your stuff, or if a pipe bursts in a roof over your office and drips water over
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:54.240]  all your, all your computing equipment, anything that could go wrong, that might go wrong locally.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:31:01.680]  Having an offsite backup is just a tremendous peace of mind and it can be a lifesaver.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.360]  So where do you go to find out more? I've been using backplace for years. I recommend it. I
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.800]  would recommend it if they stopped sponsoring the show. If they stopped sponsoring during
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:16.160]  fireball, I would still recommend it. Uh, five bucks a month per per machine. Go to back blaze.com
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.640]  slash daring fireball. And they will know that you came here from the show and you'll,
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:27.120]  you'll get a 15 day free trial. My thanks to them. I like that back place. I've been using
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.520]  that for a long time. Yeah. It's a great service. I always forget that I have it running. I really
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.280]  do. Yeah. Yeah. Only time I remember is I restart and I see the little flame icon. Every once in a
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.920]  while I have an external drive, uh, on my desktop that I don't always keep plugged in. It's just,
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.960]  I just call it storage and it's where I keep all sorts of big ass stuff like video and stuff that I
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.080]  don't necessarily want to fill up my S my SSD with. And every once in a while I don't have it
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.760]  plugged in for a while and they send you a nice little email that says, Hey, you know, that,
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.400]  that device hasn't been backed up in 21 days or something like that. Right. And that's like,
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.720]  Oh yeah. Back boys is still running. I don't really need to, I don't really need to plug it
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.960]  back in because part of the reason it hasn't been backed up in 21 days is I obviously haven't changed
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:14.080]  anything. So exactly. Yeah. But anyway, I use carbon copy, cloner for local and then backplace
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:21.040]  for yep. For external case, my house burns down. Yep. Yep. And then you think, wow, this is good
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:27.760]  news. My house burned down, but I've, I get to reset up my computer. It's awesome. It's any
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:35.520]  nerds will take any excuse to reset up a computer. Oh, so, all right. One of the points I wouldn't
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:43.040]  say of contention, but one of the, the, the, the, the, the things that we didn't really think
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:48.800]  about last week during that, that meeting and Cupertino was, uh, what they, what Schiller had
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.600]  said was, Hey, all right, we're working on a new Mac pro thought up thought from the ground up.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:33:00.640]  We're working on new Apple branded displays to go along with them. Neither you're not going to see
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:07.680]  that these products this year and ever, I think every single other person at the table heard that
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:14.320]  and thought, okay, these things are coming next year. Uh, and wow. That, and, and, and sort of
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:20.080]  in the context of, wow, Apple is telling us about a product that's a year out, which is, you know,
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:24.080]  sort of unprecedented. I guess it's the longest ever. I mean, they've done things like they
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:28.240]  unveiled the iPhone at Mac world in January and it didn't ship until June. There's, that's a six
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:37.040]  month lead. Uh, a year is pretty unusual if not unprecedented. Um, but I had that in my story at
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.840]  at least one point where I used the phrase quote unquote next year and I got pinged the next
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.600]  morning, uh, from someone at Apple PR just to clarify that Apple didn't say next year. They
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.960]  did not say next year either. They just said not this year and that there's this, there's obviously
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:34:00.160]  a subtle difference between not this year and next year, which is that in theory it might not come
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.720]  until 2019. Yeah. Nobody from Apple reached out to me like proactively like that, but I did look
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.360]  at my, when I was looking at the, through my transcript just to, you know, kind of re make
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.800]  sure I got everything right and all that, I realized that nobody did. I am, I think it was
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.880]  Lance kind of mentioned twice, Hey, you know, these things that are coming next year, blah,
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.640]  blah, blah, you know, just doesn't lead into another question. And there was no pushback.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.280]  Right. So I think that's kind of where my brain clicked over. Okay, fine. They didn't push back
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  against these, but it was a conversation. So I didn't expect them to necessarily push back
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:37.840]  against every little thing, or maybe they were just waiting for the point of the question. Right.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:43.360]  And they didn't, you know, they slipped their mind or whatever. But yeah, nowhere in that
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.800]  did they specify next year. So that makes sense. And I don't think that it means that it won't come
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.840]  next year. Maybe it will. But I also think that they want to leave themselves wiggle room in case
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.920]  they can't get it done. And it's first quarter, the year after, second quarter of the year after,
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.360]  you know what I mean? I can't fathom will be see it being three years from now. But no, I definitely
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.520]  think that they did not want to commit to, you know, exactly 18 months from now, no longer kind
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:15.840]  of thing, you know, I think it's I, I, at first, I was a little alarmed by it. But then I thought,
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:22.160]  you know what, I think it's just, it's just not. It's their institutional resistance to talking
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.720]  about stuff in the future and making any promises at all. And and their sort of desire to under
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.240]  promise and over deliver. I can't help but suspect that internally, they certainly are
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.760]  shooting for next year, if not early next year. I can't help but think that but that they know
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.880]  that Murphy's law can hit and that they might spend six months pursuing path x and decide,
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.040]  nope, we need to backtrack and go down path y instead. And now we're six, we've lost six
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:54.080]  months that that can happen with the product. But given the fact that they're hitting this reset
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:01.360]  button on a what's now four year old computer, or almost for coming on for it, but that's called
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.720]  three, I guess, because it's shipped at the end of 2013. Let's be generous and call it a three
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:16.000]  and a half year old computer. That they're doing this now and saying it's still going to take at
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.240]  least a year. That that's a pretty long time for the world's most, most successful, profitable
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:33.760]  company that specializes in making computers to make a computer that should be at a basic level
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:41.680]  fundamentally similar to, you know, high end Intel based workstations, you know, that that part of
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.400]  this is, isn't, you know, it's not like they're designing their own, at least we think they're
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.240]  not designing their own CPU to go with this. Right. You know that and, you know, and on the
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.840]  flip side of that, I don't want to do so I want to hear your thoughts about is, is part of the
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.320]  pushback I got from my article was specifically about this, it's not coming this year. And the
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:07.280]  pushback I heard was from people, readers and listeners of the show who are obviously
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:13.440]  frustrated at the Mac Pro, who didn't take this announcement as the good news that I took it as
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.880]  because my biggest fear, like I said, going in was that they were going to say we're not going to
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.280]  make a Mac Pro anymore. Right. Like nothing at all. Right. Right. That's my that was my bad
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.200]  news. And my good news scenario is that the Mac Pro is coming, but it's not coming for a while.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.400]  And I thought that that was the good news. Because if the the in theory, good news would be,
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.760]  we have a new Mac Pro, and here it is, or we have a new Mac Pro, and it's coming at WWDC,
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:43.120]  they wouldn't have had the meeting, they would have just either shown had an event and shown it,
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.520]  or they would have waited until June, they could have at least waited that long. And then and shown
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.440]  it. I think the fact that it couldn't even be shown in June meant that they needed to do
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.960]  something like this. And so I knew that going into the meeting that there's no way they're going to
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.280]  show it to us, you know, it can't be coming soon. So the best possible case would be that they say
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.480]  to us, you know, it's coming at the end of the year, I thought would maybe be the ideal case.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:15.920]  But what I heard from people was, God damn it, why can't Apple just take a motherboard from Intel,
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:22.720]  and some high end Nvidia graphics cards and put them in a goddamn box and sell it to me? Right?
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.880]  How long can it take? Right? How long can it take to make a nice to the eyes aluminum case done?
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.400]  Right. You know, give Johnny Ives team a month to make a nice looking box and ship the goddamn thing.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.440]  And I wonder what you what you think about that? Like, what is it that they're doing that's going
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:48.000]  to take them at least a year combated to however long they've already been working on on this,
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.360]  which seems to be at least six months, probably a little more, but at least six months since I,
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:39:00.560]  I think they flipped the switch and said, full speed ahead. Yeah. I don't know. I mean,
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.760]  I keep going back. It's like, almost like hunting me now when they're saying like, you know,
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.920]  if we're gonna do anything, we want to make sure that it's innovative and that, you know,
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.960]  it's not the same old thing. And I think I think that it's fine. Like the best case scenario that
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.760]  is iPhone. You know, I don't know what that could be. There's two things that stick in my mind,
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.440]  completely unrelated to Apple. Well, not not completely, but you know, sort of unrelated to
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.920]  Apple that they did sound intriguing. One of the reasons I asked, you know, what's your feeling on
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:37.360]  external GPUs was, that was my assumption of what the Mac Pro was. Because I had heard a little bit
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:42.160]  before the Mac Pro was announced, you know, these things start to come up in conversation as you
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.400]  have them. Nothing I could put together really solidly, but I'd heard, you know, it's a little
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.720]  blob of a machine and they're going to focus on peripherals, which is essentially what they were
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.760]  trying to do. But the peripherals never really materialized because of Thunderbolt issues and
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.000]  all that stuff, you know, in terms of the vast array of them they thought were going to accompany
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.280]  this thing. But the peripheral that I was really focused on in my mind was an external GPU. So it's
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.880]  saying, hey, like, this is what we launched today. We think it's going to be great for most people's
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.680]  computing needs, blah, blah, blah. And then, you know, in six months, we're gonna have a partner
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.640]  like Nvidia or AMD, obviously who they work very closely with, who has an external GPU you can plug
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.920]  in and it'll handle your rendering tasks and run your games. And you just pick which GPU you're
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.360]  going to use and boom, right? And you can just do that. And this that way, this little blob of a
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:37.440]  machine lives on your desk for for five years, eight years, 10 years, and you get the newest GPU
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.840]  and plug it in. And as long as the IO doesn't change, you know, we don't have some massive
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.800]  change in shift in IO, which will happen every five, eight years, whatever, then you're good,
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.160]  you're golden. And you're going to be able to keep using this for the GPU intensive tasks that you
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:58.240]  have. And that was my thought originally for it. I was obviously too aggressive in the way I was
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.920]  thinking about it. It gets one way to put it. I think Apple was too though. I do. Well, yeah,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.840]  yeah, yeah, I guess so. But not in that way, right? In a different way, in a different direction
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:14.000]  completely. So my thinking is like, maybe that's the answer. Maybe that they figured out like,
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:22.080]  hey, maybe external GPUs are the thing. And they can go to Nvidia and say, hey, build us a GPU or
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.640]  an accessory that people plug their GPUs into, and then we don't have to worry about it. But that
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.680]  doesn't, it doesn't seem right to me. Right? Because like, then they would be doubling down
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.520]  on their current shape and form factor. And I don't think that they would be doing that,
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:42.480]  if they brought us in to have this whole discussion. Yeah, but the answer was unambiguous,
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.640]  though. You asked, do you guys see a future for external GPUs? And I think it was Federighi who
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.320]  answered unambiguously, yes. We see a place for external GPUs. It was very short, very sweet.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.240]  There was no preamble. They're interesting. And then Turnus, I think, said, for some applications,
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.000]  absolutely. For others, no. Which is another way of saying, yeah, it doesn't work always,
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.400]  but it does work sometimes. But no, those are terrible, terrible idea, like touch, right?
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.000]  Right. Right. And that was like a long discussion about why they're no, no, why they're not,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.440]  you know, of all the, you know, a lot of the questions they wouldn't give a yes or no to,
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.360]  but they gave a no to touch. And it was, it wasn't just no, it was no. And it was a long
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.800]  discussion, but the external GPU was yes, for some cases. I think the other thing that they
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.360]  were pretty unambiguous about is that the new Mac Pro has to be able to support a big honking
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.800]  internal GPU. That whatever you might do as a niche within a niche, that would require
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:44.400]  external GPUs. Fundamentally, this machine has to accommodate a big honking GPU that's there
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.360]  all the time and can get pretty, can do things that'll make it hot and have the heat dissipate.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.720]  I thought that was pretty unambiguous too.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:43:00.240]  There was, so the other trend besides the external GPUs, I'll just interject this. I don't,
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:08.400]  I don't know why this is tickling my brain, but there's, there are types of computers,
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.520]  obviously the people that build PCs are very familiar, you know, that you have
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:18.400]  like the full size ATX case, right? Which is your big case. And then you have mini ATX,
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:24.080]  a micro ATX, so on and so forth, right? Basically smaller and smaller cases. And at some point,
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.000]  they, you have to get like a smaller motherboard, a motherboard that's meant specifically to
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.720]  conserve space. And maybe it doesn't have as many RAM slots, or maybe it doesn't, you know,
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.120]  have as many creature comforts or whatever. And it shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. But there are,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:45.440]  there are miniature preview of computers called nukes or nucks that are, Microsoft has a very
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.200]  popular one where if it's like you need, you know, you need somebody who needs a computer,
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.640]  but they don't really need anything special, they just buy a nuke, right? It's like 250 bucks and
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.600]  boom, you get yourself a computer, plug a monitor in and you're good. And then there's other ones
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:07.360]  that are about, really about like fitting really robust graphics cards into tiny cases,
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.760]  like really small cases. And some of these PC, and I'll have to look it up once again,
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.720]  I don't have it at my fingertips, but some of these cases are essentially an excuse for a
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.600]  graphics card, right? They just, they wrap around the graphics card. The motherboard is specifically
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:26.000]  designed to fit inside the case as small as possible. And the thing, it looks like a bread
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.880]  loaf, right? And it's just, it's all about the GPU. And it's for gamers who want the power,
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:39.040]  but don't want to sacrifice the space. And I think VR and to a lesser extent AR are driving this,
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.880]  this sort of category where you've got a person who wants to do VR and maybe they want to port
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.120]  it around and go to groups to, you know, go to their friend's house and bring it or whatever.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.720]  Like these VR evangelists pushing the thing forward and gamers who want the latest bleeding
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.920]  edge, you know, thing like a hundred thousand VR headsets or so have been sold so far. So you
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.400]  figure a hundred thousand users, that's enough for some case manufacturer to go, Hey, let me build
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.080]  this specialty case, right? And I think for me, it makes a ton of sense. Like I love it. I love
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.040]  the idea because like if I travel between cities and I want, which I do often, and I want to bring
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.400]  my VR kit, I can pack my headset and my cords into a relatively small bag, but then I got this big
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.960]  old tower computer that runs this thing and that sucks, right? And a laptop sort of runs it, but
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:32.560]  it won't run it really well. It won't run it like an Nvidia high-end 1080 or, you know, high-end
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.840]  AMD card well. And so there's something about that. It's like, maybe that you're thinking like,
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:44.400]  well, heck, if this is the future, let's lean into it, right? Let's honor the shape and the
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:51.360]  power and the desire to slot these things in here and just build a case that accommodates
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:58.000]  two full-size graphics cards and up to four SSDs and that's it. You know what I mean? I don't know,
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.040]  you know, it's like same kind of ideas, but leaning in a different direction. And I just
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.240]  don't know if they do that or if they go full on like bunch of space. I think VR is an interesting
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:14.560]  topic combined with this discussion of the Mac Pro and the most powerful possible graphics you
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:25.120]  can get running on an Apple device today, but not in the obvious first level scenario of, hey,
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:32.000]  in the current world, Mac users can't run VR in a mass market way or can't do it well. And that
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.600]  things like the Oculus don't even support it because there's no graphics card that's up to
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:40.480]  their specs, et cetera, et cetera. I think from Apple's perspective, that's not really relevant.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:46.320]  And I think that they're correct that it's not relevant, that the ultimate mass market way for
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.280]  Apple to do VR or AR is to create a standalone device with a, this is what Apple does is when
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:59.520]  they go to a new form factor, they create a new entirely new interface that is meant to be optimal
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:05.680]  for that form factor. And so from Apple's perspective, the right way to do VR is to
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:11.920]  bide your time and wait until the technology can be put into a desirable product that you just put
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:20.400]  over your eyes and you've, you're using their new VR product and it's running a VR OS. But
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.880]  in the meantime, pro users have a need to do VR now, not the consumer users for playing games
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.480]  and stuff like that. That's not really Apple's purview. But like I can totally see like why
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:38.800]  Sony has, we have one in the house, the kid has it, has a VR headset that runs right now and
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:44.000]  people can play games and it's kind of cool and immersive. But at a professional level,
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.440]  somebody's got to make the VR stuff and somebody's got to do the work. And if you assume
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.640]  that Apple, just think about Apple's own needs internally is, you know, it's widely rumored that
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:57.840]  Apple has teams working on VR and especially AR. Apple's even said publicly that they're
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:07.760]  interested in augmented reality. What are Apple's engineers inside the company using to do these
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.280]  things that is so super? Right. Right. Exactly. Like if they're going to, I mean, I know for fact,
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:18.000]  obviously that they're working on AR and VR who, you know, they'd be dumb not to. And they have
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.960]  these teams of people, you know, poking and prodding at it from different varying angles,
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.640]  trying to figure out, is this the right way to go? Is that the right way to go? Do we build
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.320]  glasses? Do we build this thing? Do we build the other thing? Like, what the hell are they using?
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.840]  Right. Macintosh is probably, I have heard, I don't know, you know, in recent weeks, both,
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.200]  both after from a couple people after last week's news broke and, and, you know, our stories hit.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.160]  Our stories hit. Um, but even in the weeks leading up to this, as I've, you know, after I
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:52.000]  linked to a thing about a video editor who long time Mac user, who's reluctantly moving to windows,
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:59.360]  um, just, just because the GPU situation didn't meet his needs on Mac. Um, I heard from people
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.600]  within Apple, little birdies, um, just saying, yeah, it's in some ways it's a shit show.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.560]  And that there've been, you know, people in Apple who were like, I don't even know what to do.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.080]  Should I try to requisition the Linux box? And it, you know, is that even going to, you know,
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.600]  cause it's like, Apple's not even set up for things like that to go through, like for an
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:23.840]  engineer to ask for non Apple hardware, but that, you know, um, you know, just, uh, different needs
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.520]  within the company. I mean, but AR, I didn't hear from anybody working on an AR, but I heard from
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:35.440]  somebody who's working at Apple with large data sets, let's say, and that, uh, there is no Apple
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:41.120]  computer that actually is state of the art for, for the needs of their work, which is a really
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:48.400]  weird situation for Apple to be like, I'd love to see the POs. Right. It goes back to what it
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.600]  reminds me of is I forget the exact details of the story, but the, at, in the early days,
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:59.120]  like 1983 or 84. So like when the original Mac was getting on a cusp of launching, they had a,
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.000]  they bought a cray to, to do certain super computing needs, you know, for the development
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.960]  of the Mac. Um, which made total sense because, you know, supercomputers were totally different
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.040]  things from personal computers for supercomputers were at least by the standards of the day,
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:16.720]  the fastest possible computers money could buy. And they would cost like a million dollars or
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.720]  something like that. And a personal computer was supposed to cost $2,000 or $2,500 or whatever.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:28.800]  Um, and, you know, obviously it was only ran a fraction of the power, but in recent years,
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.600]  you know, at least certainly for the entirety of the macro S 10 era where, you know, it was
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:42.560]  a Unix workstation, you know, you didn't need to go outside the company to buy a Linux workstation.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.880]  Uh, and you know, and they run into all sorts of problems where it doesn't, you know, you'd really
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  have to go down the hack, like you said, the Hackintosh route, because just buying a Linux
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:55.920]  box to do this, doesn't let you run X code and your stuff might require X code in particular,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:02.000]  not just any C compiler or whatever. So it's it, you know, and then it just think of anybody
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.520]  outside the company who's working on VR and AR and stuff for the future, where it becomes a much more
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:12.800]  mass product market product. Well, the, the work is being done today. That's laying the groundwork
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.960]  for the future where AR and VR are mass market technologies that everybody just sort of takes for
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:24.400]  granted. Like we take for granted touchscreens and everything else down the chain, uh, that work is
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:31.760]  going on today and it really is not suited to the Mac pro. Yeah. And it is, I mean, the people that
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.800]  are at some point you have to think to yourself, okay, the people that are shaping the future of
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:42.880]  computing, what tools are they using? Like the shovels are incredibly important. I mean, in,
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.520]  in the startup community, you know, you always have this, I mean, it's, you know, tech in general,
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:53.440]  but startups, especially you have this philosophy that, you know, you'll hear VCs or entrepreneurs
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.680]  talk about where they say, you know, build the shovels, right. Or invest in the shovels,
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:01.680]  because in the end, everybody needs a shovel. You gotta, you gotta dig the hole. You gotta
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.440]  pour the foundation and build your thing on top of it. But if you're the shovel maker,
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:09.680]  everybody needs a shovel, right. And at some point, either the shovel gets acquired by somebody
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:14.960]  who's like, I really need this particular shovel, or it gets widely used in either case is, you
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:21.600]  know, a major, minor success scenario for a startup. And it just goes to, you know, it leads
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.880]  in this line of thinking, Apple for many years, they built the shovels, right. They built the,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.600]  what, what you would use, what you would launch your thing on and build your thing on top of,
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.240]  but they also built the shovels. And they still are a shovel builder to a degree. But, you know,
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.880]  with Xcode and with, you know, the MacBook Pros and all, and IMAX, as they said, more and more
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.360]  people are using that for things like software development and whatnot. But if they are, if they
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:52.480]  want to maintain this hold on being the shovel builder, so people buy the shovels and they build
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:57.120]  on top of your platform with your shovels and all of that, which has been a major component of
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:02.880]  Apple's success with the iPhone and everything else, then you got to go, okay, well, what's the
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:09.040]  next big platform? And what are the shovels for that platform? You know, if AR and VR are in fact,
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:15.440]  you know, a big component of the next era of computing, and it's not something else, then
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.360]  where are your shovels for those people? And right now they don't have any, you know,
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:27.360]  or they have some that sort of work, but are not really the ideal shovels. So no major swath of
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:33.680]  those people are really going to consider it right now. I totally agree with that. And I think that's
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:39.680]  sort of what they tacitly acknowledged last week, which was, you know, it was sort of a dual emphasis.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:45.280]  It was conflicting where it was, well, maybe not conflicting, but they, they strongly emphasize
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.640]  that the needs of most of their pro users are met by the current Mac book pros and IMAX, and even
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:59.440]  more so in the near future as the new Mac book pro form factor gets improved. And with the IMAX
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:09.200]  that they emphasized include quote pro configs. But they realized that for, what was the phrase,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:17.840]  a small single digit of their users, which I think means 1%, but they didn't want to give an exact
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.720]  number, but for, yeah, it's gotta be close to that. If it's not one, it's close to one, but it's,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:29.600]  it would say a small single digit of their users. Uh, they, they need something else and they're committed
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:36.080]  to building that for them that they get it, you know, and that they clearly obviously had their eye
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.720]  off the ball in recent years on that, that segment of the market.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:45.360]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's like,
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.120]  everything is so much more open and rapid now. I think, I mean, I'm casting about a little bit here
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:56.720]  for why, but I think that software development is a completely different ball game now. You know,
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:01.520]  where it used to be, you had pipelines that were being built and legacy pipelines that,
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.640]  that sort of evolved into newer pipelines, right? And now you have sort of pipelines having to be
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:12.000]  created out of whole cloth within years, you know, a couple of years versus pipelines that
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.600]  evolved over decades. And I think that there's something there too, where it's, it's so quick,
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.720]  you have to like readjust your, your frame of reference, you know, and how fast you got to move
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.880]  on these things and provide those, those tools for people. I don't know. Maybe it's that.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.640]  Uh, on a meta level, I don't know if you had anything else you want to talk about, but the,
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:36.160]  the other thing I wanted to talk about was the meta level of the, of our, our, uh, afternoon in
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:42.480]  Cupertino, uh, was the campus itself. Like one thing, it was at the old campus. It was in a,
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:48.800]  a really old building across the street from one infinite loop across De Anza Boulevard, uh, in
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:54.560]  this sort of nondescript old California style single story office building. Uh, they did treat
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:03.200]  us to lunch at the new cafe max, which I didn't even know existed, uh, which is sort of, yeah,
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:09.280]  cafe owls. They call it coffee cafe owls, uh, which is a beautiful new building. I mean, it,
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:16.160]  it, it's, uh, it really impressive architecture. So it's, it, what struck me about the fact that
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:22.480]  the cafe owls is so nice, it's all brand new. It's got, I don't know, quadruple height ceilings.
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:28.160]  I mean, it's truly a huge space, really nice fit and finish, but also looks very new. It looks
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:33.520]  like new Apple. You know, a lot of Apple's campus is obviously very old and sort of still, I mean,
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:38.400]  predates, I mean, the whole one infinite loop campus really predates the return of Steve Jobs
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:45.280]  and the architecture really kind of looks like it. Um, but that they've made this very modern
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:51.120]  new current Apple cafeteria on the old campus, which just emphasizes what we've been hearing,
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:56.400]  which is that, yes, they're opening this massive new spaceship campus this year, but they've made
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:04.000]  new spaceship campus this year. Uh, but that they're not abandoning any, any of their previous
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.560]  office space. They're just bursting at the seams right now. Headcount. Yeah. They're going to fill
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.720]  the new headquarters and still be full at both, which is, there's some sort of bigger on the
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.600]  inside thing happening there. Well, they still saw the need to build this massive new cafeteria,
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:22.240]  or I mean, a cafeteria is the wrong word, but cafe, I guess. But, um, I thought that was pretty
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:28.320]  interesting. And then we, somebody asked during the event, uh, about whether people on their teams
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.360]  were moving in, had moved into the new campus yet. And, and it was another one of those topics where
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.240]  for whatever reason, Apple does not want to talk about it. They do not want to talk about who has
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:43.600]  moved into the new campus, who hasn't and when anybody is moving in, did you get that sense that
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.360]  they're just like, yeah, yeah, there's, oh, I mean, you know, a couple of times they're like,
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.040]  Hey, you know, it's like, we don't mind asking, but we really want to talk about the Mac, blah,
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.520]  blah, blah. And that was one of them. And yeah, they definitely are not interested at all in
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.200]  talking about how many people have moved, which departments have moved, which departments are
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:06.480]  moving, you know, all of that. Yeah. And I, I don't know what state it's in. I really don't.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:09.920]  I mean, I've watched those flyover videos every once in a while, and you can see, you know,
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.960]  that it certainly is ever closer to completion and that, you know, like landscaping is probably
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:20.640]  the last thing to be done. And it's probably the biggest thing remaining, but, uh, you know,
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.200]  for whatever reason, it was clearly not, it never, never on the table that, that last week's meeting
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.200]  was going to be held on the new campus. Even though if you would have told me a year ago
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:35.280]  that we'd be having a, uh, interesting round table discussion, uh, at the very end of March,
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:39.040]  was it the very, yeah, it was the very end of, or was it the beginning of April? I guess it was
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.840]  the beginning of April. Yeah, it was April. Uh, in April, 2017, I would have thought,
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:49.040]  Ooh, I'll bet that's on the new campus. Yeah, no, I think they're still trying to get everybody's,
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:59.120]  uh, work tables set up. Yeah. Hide the LG logos under, under five displays trying to move the
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:06.800]  routers further away from the LG monitor. Sorry. Was there anything else that you wanted to talk
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:11.840]  about before we wrap up? No, I mean, I think that covers it. I think, I think it was an interesting
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:17.280]  discussion. I think it was very interesting to hear them say, I'm sorry. We're sorry twice
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:23.280]  to the community, which, uh, come, you know, honestly the there there's one aspect of this
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.760]  where people are like, yeah, well, Apple's arrogant. They never say they're sorry,
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:31.200]  which is not totally true. They have apologized for things. Um, but there's also an enormous
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:36.000]  amount of responsibility that a corporation, you mean, you have to think about it this way,
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.400]  strategically. There's an enormous amount of responsibility that a corporation takes on when
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.720]  they say, I'm sorry, because they're admitting some sort of culpability. And now this is not
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:49.280]  like a consumer harm scenario really. Uh, I mean, I'm sure somebody will try to make an issue of it,
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.600]  right. At some point, but that's, that's not for me to, to determine. I'm no, I'm no legal analyst
[01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:01.600]  in that regard, but it, it's a big statement for the biggest company on earth to say, we're sorry,
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:08.080]  you know, twice in a, in an on the record discussion like that and not, you know, try to
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:13.040]  crib it or, or con, you know, beyond contextualizing it, of course, and trying to
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.720]  like paint a picture about why it happened. And that's like a, you know, that's a pretty
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:23.040]  ballsy thing to do. I think for a, for a product that is not a disaster, it's a disappointment.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:27.040]  It is something that they were rightfully proud of when it came out. Like there's,
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:32.080]  this is not a situation where, where heads should roll or something like that. And, you know,
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.600]  we can laugh about Schiller's can't innovate anymore. My ass it, it's, I mean, it's a whole,
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:40.960]  maybe a whole different discussion, but we don't think we need to argue it is that it was
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.080]  innovative. It just was the wrong direction for innovation, but it was truly an innovative design.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:52.720]  And to apologize for disappointing people for that, I think is different as I say,
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:01:00.000]  comparing compare and contrast with this week's United airlines fiasco where it took them 36
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:07.040]  hours to, to apologize for what was literally a disaster where, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where,
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.960]  where they issued it right before we started recording, they issued a press release that
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:16.080]  was pretty good, I think, but should have been the press release. They issued 36 hours.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.480]  It's pretty good, but right now it's like, it has no impact. It has no impact whatsoever,
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.440]  right? Too late. You know, 36 hours shooting somebody and then like offering them a bandaid
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:32.960]  and being like, Oh man, sorry about that. I already have a bottle in me. PR is the analogy
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.640]  to fires is often used with PRs that it's a, you know, it's, it's put out the, put out the fire as
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.480]  the job PR does, but it's a really, I think it's a really good analogy. And at, at when the story
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:50.160]  first leaked that this poor fellow on the flight had been bloodied while they forcibly removed him
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:55.600]  and, and disoriented and, and had a really bad experience. It, it was bad. It was a fire,
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:02.160]  but it was like a trash can fire and they let it, they let it turn from a trash can fire into
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:08.080]  a house that had been burned down fire, which, which can, you know, like real fires happens
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:13.200]  very quickly. It's just why you need, you know, PR professionals need to be quick thinking and
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.320]  ready to go. And United certainly blew that. But anyway, it just comes to mind when it comes to
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.960]  apologies that there's a big difference between apologizing for a man who's been beaten to a
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:35.200]  bloody pulp and apologizing for a rather subtly disappointing years long dawdled down the wrong
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.000]  path of the future of pro hardware engineering. And I thought it was pretty telling. Something
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.480]  that was ultimately well executed, but serve the wrong needs. Right. I thought that was pretty
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:48.560]  interesting. And I thought it was, it filled me with, I think that they've got this. I think
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:53.520]  they've, I think they lost a handle on this and didn't quite realize they had, but now they've
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:01.440]  got a firm handle on it again. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Matthew panzerino. We can, uh, we can
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:08.320]  read your fine writing and out of your staff at, uh, uh, what's the name of the site? Uh,
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:15.600]  tech crunch, tech crunch, tech crunch. Uh, it's a new up and coming site on the internet and, uh,
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:22.560]  and on Twitter, you are at panzer. Did I get it right? P a N C E R. That's it. That's it.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.200]  It's a fine, fine Twitter account where you have a very, very good commentary on,
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:45.680]  on the day's events. My thanks to you.
