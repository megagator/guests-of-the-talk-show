[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Well, good news for you is my mic is like all set up
[00:02.800 --> 00:06.360]  and I know how to use a external mic right now very well,
[00:06.360 --> 00:07.720]  because that's my whole life.
[00:07.720 --> 00:09.820]  It is everybody's life.
[00:09.820 --> 00:14.360]  I feel like everybody is becoming an expert.
[00:14.360 --> 00:15.880]  My whole setup is like,
[00:15.880 --> 00:17.800]  it's like usually when I podcast from YouTube,
[00:17.800 --> 00:20.400]  it like takes like 15 minutes to get all set and everything.
[00:20.400 --> 00:21.640]  And I'm like, nope, got it.
[00:21.640 --> 00:24.720]  All ready to sync the audio and GarageBand.
[00:24.720 --> 00:25.640]  Everything's good.
[00:25.640 --> 00:30.640]  My friend, Paul Kvassus, runs Rogue Amoeba Software.
[00:31.620 --> 00:34.180]  They do, he's been on the show before.
[00:35.480 --> 00:39.960]  They do audio hijack, sound source.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.860]  They do, you know, a whole bunch of things,
[00:41.860 --> 00:43.460]  but largely audio related.
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.660]  And so obviously there's a lot of interest in their software
[00:45.660 --> 00:48.300]  because people are recording audio from calls and stuff.
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.820]  Anyway, there was a tweet today, I forget who sent it,
[00:50.820 --> 00:53.780]  but there was a screenshot of Oprah
[00:53.780 --> 00:55.420]  doing some kind of thing with FaceTime
[00:55.420 --> 00:59.540]  and she had the audio hijack running on her Mac,
[00:59.540 --> 01:00.700]  which was exciting for them.
[01:00.700 --> 01:01.540]  It's Oprah, right?
[01:01.540 --> 01:03.220]  It's Oprah, you know, but it's so funny
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.220]  because she's just like us, right?
[01:05.220 --> 01:08.820]  She's just got a Mac, she's running FaceTime,
[01:08.820 --> 01:12.300]  and she's got her Mac propped up with like three or four
[01:12.300 --> 01:14.780]  books to get the webcam up at a reasonable height.
[01:14.780 --> 01:18.540]  And it's like, Oprah, she's a billionaire, she's Oprah.
[01:18.540 --> 01:21.260]  And she's just like us, she's using books.
[01:21.260 --> 01:22.780]  She's using books.
[01:22.780 --> 01:25.740]  What a good spread for them to do
[01:25.740 --> 01:27.740]  in People Magazine this week.
[01:27.740 --> 01:30.040]  The stars, or is it people, or is it us weekly
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.060]  that do like the stars, they're just like us.
[01:32.060 --> 01:35.340]  And they all like are holding their iPhones up
[01:35.340 --> 01:37.300]  with random things around their house
[01:37.300 --> 01:40.980]  and they are like using lamps to light themselves
[01:40.980 --> 01:44.100]  and they are, I don't know, constructing random things
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.980]  in their house to make their tech work.
[01:45.980 --> 01:48.500]  Right, it's, you know, and you know what, it's funny,
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.900]  like the books thing, it seems like, wow, you're Oprah,
[01:50.900 --> 01:53.900]  you should be able to have like a proper laptop stand
[01:53.900 --> 01:56.700]  or something, but books are sort of the best for that
[01:56.700 --> 02:01.080]  because everybody who's smart or has lots of books,
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.080]  books are very stable, right, they're perfectly flat,
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.220]  and because if you just have like one shelf full of books
[02:09.220 --> 02:12.340]  to choose from, if you choose the right number of books,
[02:12.340 --> 02:15.020]  it's actually very, very adjustable.
[02:15.020 --> 02:18.320]  Like if you decide, ah, this is so close,
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.100]  but I really wish it was like a half an inch higher,
[02:21.100 --> 02:23.840]  you could just find either like a half inch thick book
[02:23.840 --> 02:26.100]  or get, you know, swap one book out
[02:26.100 --> 02:28.680]  for one that's slightly thicker to move it up.
[02:29.540 --> 02:32.540]  Books, what a technology, books.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.900]  You cannot do that with a Kindle book.
[02:34.900 --> 02:37.060]  No, and actually books do work,
[02:37.060 --> 02:39.340]  I've been using some books for my laptop,
[02:39.340 --> 02:42.100]  but they do not work well for iPhone or iPad
[02:42.100 --> 02:44.540]  if you don't have the right amount of books
[02:44.540 --> 02:46.980]  because I find that like either it just falls,
[02:46.980 --> 02:50.820]  and if you have no case on your iPhone or iPad,
[02:50.820 --> 02:53.220]  it either falls forward or back.
[02:54.780 --> 02:56.380]  I did a video about this a couple of weeks ago,
[02:56.380 --> 02:58.180]  how to make a homemade stand for your iPad
[02:58.180 --> 03:00.740]  because I was putting my iPad on all these random things
[03:00.740 --> 03:02.580]  and it kept falling backwards,
[03:02.580 --> 03:05.580]  and I wanted to go order an iPad stand from Amazon,
[03:05.580 --> 03:07.860]  and of course they were back ordered forever.
[03:07.860 --> 03:09.140]  Finally, I got them in this week,
[03:09.140 --> 03:12.940]  but no, a wire hanger and a cardboard box,
[03:12.940 --> 03:14.720]  great stands for your iPad.
[03:14.720 --> 03:18.040]  So you had to call them on this?
[03:18.040 --> 03:20.200]  I didn't say call, I did a quick video about this.
[03:20.200 --> 03:21.040]  Yeah, a quick video.
[03:21.040 --> 03:23.000]  Now this is for an iPad.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.200]  Yeah, it works for an iPhone though too.
[03:24.200 --> 03:25.560]  Oh, I did see that, I did see that.
[03:25.560 --> 03:27.400]  Yeah, and you made one out of Lego too, right?
[03:27.400 --> 03:31.160]  Yes, yes, I mean, that was my project, my son,
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.440]  and then it falls every time.
[03:32.440 --> 03:34.040]  We did a call this morning,
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.440]  he had a doctor's appointment on FaceTime
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.640]  and then the Legos just completely fell down.
[03:39.720 --> 03:42.000]  So yeah, actually this all means to say
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.360]  just buy a nice iPad stand.
[03:44.360 --> 03:46.280]  Well, it's funny though, because iPads,
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.360]  they have better, right into the show,
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.680]  but this plays into your MacBook Air video from last week.
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.800]  So it's a question, what device do you use
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.200]  for doing a call?
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.840]  Because a Mac is most flexible, right?
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.680]  And it's got, you just stack it on some books,
[04:08.680 --> 04:10.880]  it's not top heavy, Macs, once you have it
[04:10.880 --> 04:13.440]  on a pile of books, or any laptop, right?
[04:13.440 --> 04:16.880]  Any regular laptop, Mac, PC, whatever,
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.040]  it's not gonna fall over,
[04:18.040 --> 04:20.560]  because the screen is very lightweight
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.280]  and the base with the keyboard is very heavy.
[04:23.280 --> 04:25.400]  So you put some books or anything to prop it up
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.140]  and then you can tilt the screen just the way you want it,
[04:28.140 --> 04:29.200]  there you go.
[04:29.200 --> 04:32.440]  But terrible cameras.
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.440]  iPads, great cameras, but they're very top heavy.
[04:37.480 --> 04:38.320]  Kind of.
[04:39.240 --> 04:40.880]  And my big thing,
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.820]  because when I was doing that video on the iPad stands,
[04:43.820 --> 04:45.960]  I was recording a lot of video
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.760]  using the front facing camera from the iPad.
[04:48.760 --> 04:51.680]  And I guess I'd always realized this,
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.560]  but video calling with your iPad vertically
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.040]  is not as good as video calling horizontally,
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.040]  but the camera then gets put on the horizontal side
[05:01.040 --> 05:03.720]  because the camera's located at the top of the screen
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.920]  if the top of the screen is vertical.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.760]  You follow me?
[05:06.760 --> 05:11.000]  I do, and I ran into the exact same problem where I was
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  on a group Zoom happy hour last week with a bunch of friends
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.280]  just, hey, let's just talk to friends.
[05:21.280 --> 05:24.480]  And I got complaints because my video was vertical
[05:24.480 --> 05:27.760]  because I was using my iPad vertically
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.680]  and they were like, everybody else is horizontal,
[05:30.680 --> 05:33.360]  they're driving a sunch, John, you gotta go horizontal.
[05:33.360 --> 05:34.720]  But then when I went horizontal,
[05:34.720 --> 05:36.320]  now my camera's off to the left.
[05:36.320 --> 05:37.760]  I guess you could flip it around the other way
[05:37.760 --> 05:40.240]  and make it on the right, but either way it's not centered.
[05:40.240 --> 05:41.320]  Right, and you're looking,
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.960]  because you're used to video calling on a laptop,
[05:43.960 --> 05:45.960]  you're looking smack in the middle of the laptop.
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.860]  I mean, as much as, and I've always give this advice,
[05:47.860 --> 05:50.440]  like I've written this work from home column every day
[05:50.440 --> 05:52.600]  for our newsletter and I'm like, feel like every day
[05:52.600 --> 05:54.360]  I'm like, look into the camera, look into the camera.
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.640]  But like, it's so hard to look into the camera
[05:56.640 --> 05:57.480]  when you're video chatting,
[05:57.480 --> 06:00.060]  you wanna look at the screen, which makes sense, right?
[06:00.060 --> 06:03.060]  You're looking at the person, but with the iPad,
[06:03.060 --> 06:05.200]  you end up trying to look at the center of the screen,
[06:05.200 --> 06:06.760]  but actually that camera's off to the right,
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.080]  so it just looks super weird to the viewer.
[06:09.080 --> 06:12.140]  Yeah, and we're all getting used to this,
[06:12.140 --> 06:17.140]  and it's kind of, in that way that we're collectively,
[06:17.920 --> 06:19.520]  all the good people on the planet
[06:19.520 --> 06:21.040]  are all pulling with each other,
[06:21.040 --> 06:22.360]  and we're all forgiving of it,
[06:22.360 --> 06:24.480]  and everybody's having business calls,
[06:24.480 --> 06:27.540]  and we're all that guy, remember that guy on the BBC
[06:27.540 --> 06:29.920]  and his little girl, he was over in Taiwan or something,
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.900]  and his little girl came barging into the room
[06:32.900 --> 06:33.740]  a year or two ago.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.580]  Yeah, it was the best.
[06:34.580 --> 06:37.440]  It was the best, and they became worldwide celebrities
[06:37.440 --> 06:39.000]  because the girl was adorable,
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.720]  and she had this nice little march when she came in.
[06:42.720 --> 06:44.200]  But we're all that now, right?
[06:44.200 --> 06:47.040]  Dogs are coming in, and kids are coming in,
[06:47.040 --> 06:49.020]  and all sorts of crazy stuff.
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.780]  You could be in the middle of a very important meeting
[06:52.780 --> 06:56.440]  with your colleagues remotely, and if the doorbell rings,
[06:56.440 --> 06:59.280]  and you think it might be a shipment of toilet paper,
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.640]  everybody agrees, go, go answer the door.
[07:02.640 --> 07:03.480]  You cannot.
[07:03.480 --> 07:08.480]  You cannot miss the possibility of receiving some TP.
[07:08.520 --> 07:09.800]  Everybody gets it.
[07:09.800 --> 07:11.080]  We're all in this together.
[07:11.080 --> 07:14.840]  But I do think that as forgiving as we all can be
[07:14.840 --> 07:19.840]  of makeshift offices and PCs and webcams
[07:22.180 --> 07:24.200]  that people haven't been used to using
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.600]  in a professional context
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.680]  because they just haven't needed them,
[07:27.680 --> 07:30.360]  it's weird when you're not making eye contact
[07:30.360 --> 07:33.060]  with the camera because you look like you're like,
[07:33.060 --> 07:33.900]  what are you doing?
[07:33.900 --> 07:37.800]  Are you reading a web browser over on the side?
[07:37.800 --> 07:39.840]  You could be paying complete attention to the meeting,
[07:39.840 --> 07:42.040]  but if your eyes are off to the side,
[07:42.040 --> 07:45.040]  it makes you look like you're reading your phone
[07:45.040 --> 07:46.380]  or something.
[07:46.380 --> 07:50.060]  Yeah, and I think before we were in this period,
[07:50.060 --> 07:53.800]  we kind of took video chatting for granted,
[07:53.800 --> 07:54.760]  which is weird for me to say
[07:54.760 --> 07:56.800]  because we do it all the time with my parents
[07:56.800 --> 07:58.660]  and my son with his grandparents.
[07:58.660 --> 08:01.560]  But when I was doing a video call with work people,
[08:01.560 --> 08:03.200]  it was always this sort of like, okay,
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.440]  it's off on the side, I'm not paying attention to it.
[08:05.440 --> 08:09.260]  But now I'm so desperate for human interaction
[08:09.260 --> 08:10.800]  and face-to-face human interaction
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.860]  and this is the only way I'm communicating with colleagues
[08:12.860 --> 08:15.080]  that I'm actually paying attention to it.
[08:15.080 --> 08:17.680]  So you're hypercritical of what you're seeing
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.520]  and you wanna make the experience better,
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.880]  but there's, like you're saying,
[08:22.880 --> 08:25.560]  you're not really sure what other people are doing.
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.840]  You've got the quality in the middle of this all,
[08:28.840 --> 08:32.840]  like the actual webcam quality, the design of these devices.
[08:32.840 --> 08:35.080]  And then of course, like the big one being these services,
[08:35.080 --> 08:37.640]  the internet services, which are hit or miss
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.920]  on terms of a lot of things.
[08:38.920 --> 08:42.460]  I know you've been covering some of the Zoom issues.
[08:42.460 --> 08:45.640]  So it's sort of all of a mess, really.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.600]  I mean, it's great.
[08:46.600 --> 08:47.880]  Like on one hand, like it's great.
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.840]  It's amazing that we have these tools and we can do it.
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.400]  On the other hand, it's like, this whole stuff
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.400]  has been a mess and just like,
[08:52.400 --> 08:54.440]  no one's really been paying attention to it.
[08:54.440 --> 08:56.580]  Yeah, and I keep thinking about the fact
[08:56.580 --> 09:01.560]  that there's no, Josh Topolski had a column a week ago
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.520]  over at The Input, his new thing,
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.560]  and I just thought it was such a nice sentiment,
[09:05.560 --> 09:07.120]  just thank God for the internet,
[09:07.120 --> 09:09.560]  I think was actually the headline of the column.
[09:09.560 --> 09:12.500]  And in a nutshell, it's true.
[09:12.500 --> 09:15.560]  As awful as the whole situation is,
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.520]  it is so much more bearable and so many of us are,
[09:20.520 --> 09:24.880]  and I realize, again, with all, it's really,
[09:24.880 --> 09:27.280]  I know that there are millions and millions,
[09:27.280 --> 09:29.520]  tens of millions, hundreds of millions, I guess,
[09:29.520 --> 09:32.060]  of people who have jobs that can't be done remotely
[09:32.060 --> 09:34.120]  and it's a huge economic problem,
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.880]  but for those of us who can, it's terrific that we can,
[09:38.880 --> 09:42.160]  but it's entirely enabled over the internet.
[09:42.160 --> 09:43.640]  And then at a social level,
[09:43.640 --> 09:46.300]  the fact that we're still able to do anything
[09:46.300 --> 09:48.520]  other than simple phone calls
[09:48.520 --> 09:51.440]  and we can actually do things like see faces
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.440]  and share screens and stuff, and just keep ourselves
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.720]  from going insane and doing something
[09:59.720 --> 10:02.320]  other than watching TV all day,
[10:02.320 --> 10:04.800]  which is where we would have been 30 years ago,
[10:06.200 --> 10:08.280]  it's unbelievable.
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.560]  No, and that's why I said it's a mess,
[10:11.560 --> 10:14.160]  but it's like, we're not gonna complain about a lot of this.
[10:14.160 --> 10:15.840]  And I feel like everything I've been writing
[10:15.840 --> 10:18.000]  has been somewhat complaining, but also like,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.600]  well, I wouldn't have noticed this before.
[10:20.600 --> 10:22.280]  That's how I sort of did this angle
[10:22.280 --> 10:25.040]  with the webcam on the air review.
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.320]  It's like, this is something
[10:27.320 --> 10:29.680]  that we just didn't think about before.
[10:29.680 --> 10:30.880]  Or maybe we thought about it,
[10:30.880 --> 10:33.480]  but it wasn't number one on the thing to consider
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.440]  about evaluating a laptop being the webcam.
[10:36.440 --> 10:38.880]  Yeah, we might as well start with it, but.
[10:40.160 --> 10:41.080]  Can we not start the show?
[10:41.080 --> 10:42.600]  Is this not gonna go somewhere?
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.080]  I'm started.
[10:44.080 --> 10:44.920]  I've started.
[10:44.920 --> 10:45.840]  Yeah, I'm fully into it.
[10:45.840 --> 10:46.960]  This is the show.
[10:46.960 --> 10:48.640]  This is the show.
[10:48.640 --> 10:50.040]  I think we should now just tell people
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.920]  we did not officially start the show.
[10:51.920 --> 10:55.080]  I just called John and just started talking like this,
[10:55.080 --> 10:57.640]  which is what I always assume his show is.
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.320]  Exactly.
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.200]  I love how you also, you were like, I'm off today.
[11:01.200 --> 11:03.360]  I'm not working today, technically.
[11:04.320 --> 11:06.960]  In my life, when I say I'm not working, I'm off.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.640]  It's pretty much I'm always working, but you were like,
[11:08.640 --> 11:10.200]  why would you wanna spend the day with me?
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.640]  I'm like, this does not work for me.
[11:12.640 --> 11:14.640]  Well, that's very kind of you to say, Joanna.
[11:14.640 --> 11:15.680]  Yeah.
[11:15.680 --> 11:16.920]  I do, I don't know.
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.960]  I mean, I know that you have the full
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.280]  institutional organization of the Wall Street Journal
[11:29.240 --> 11:32.520]  to work within, and so there is more of a structure.
[11:32.520 --> 11:36.840]  I have to say, on an ordinary basis, in normal times,
[11:36.840 --> 11:38.680]  the way I work, the fact that I don't really
[11:38.680 --> 11:42.840]  have colleagues, I can lose track of what day it is.
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.480]  In the midst of this, it is absolutely nuts
[11:47.480 --> 11:50.200]  how frequently I completely forget
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.960]  what day of the week it is.
[11:51.960 --> 11:54.160]  Same, same.
[11:54.160 --> 11:56.560]  You said yesterday, you thought yesterday was Friday.
[11:56.560 --> 11:59.200]  Number one, it did occur to me,
[11:59.200 --> 12:00.760]  you mentioned this on chat yesterday,
[12:00.760 --> 12:02.280]  that you thought yesterday was Friday.
[12:02.280 --> 12:06.400]  Now, this was at like eight or nine o'clock at night,
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.480]  which does make me think that, therefore,
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.400]  you must have thought you blew off our show.
[12:11.400 --> 12:14.600]  Because you said we were gonna do it on Friday.
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.480]  I didn't call you out on it.
[12:16.480 --> 12:18.480]  I was like, oh, I should check in with him
[12:18.480 --> 12:20.680]  about when we should do the show.
[12:20.680 --> 12:23.360]  And I was like, but I thought it was supposed to be today,
[12:23.360 --> 12:26.280]  so I might have missed it, but oh well.
[12:26.280 --> 12:29.240]  I mean, then you didn't remind me to do the show.
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.800]  If I had missed it, you didn't remind me to do it.
[12:31.800 --> 12:33.840]  No, I did not check in.
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.400]  Tuesday, it was like, I don't know.
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.520]  I worked till like, I took a break for dinner and stuff,
[12:39.520 --> 12:40.520]  but then I went back to work,
[12:40.520 --> 12:43.560]  and I think I wasn't really done working on stuff
[12:43.560 --> 12:45.920]  for Daring Fireball until around midnight.
[12:45.920 --> 12:48.600]  And I'm a night owl, and this whole situation
[12:48.600 --> 12:51.800]  has only exacerbated the fact that it doesn't really matter
[12:51.800 --> 12:54.400]  what time of day I do anything.
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.600]  But I didn't get done until, I don't know, midnight or so.
[12:57.600 --> 13:00.320]  Wanted to watch some TV with Amy,
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.960]  and she's shifted way from waking up early
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.420]  to sleeping in a bit and staying up later,
[13:07.420 --> 13:09.400]  so wasn't stretching it too much.
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.360]  I was 100% convinced it was Monday.
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.000]  It was Tuesday at midnight,
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.440]  so it was two days into the week,
[13:14.440 --> 13:15.960]  and I forget how it came up.
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.120]  She was like, no, today's Tuesday.
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.440]  And I was like, oh, I really had no idea.
[13:20.440 --> 13:22.440]  I honestly, I was so convinced of it,
[13:22.440 --> 13:25.120]  I actually looked at my phone and was like,
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.840]  ah, she's really right.
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.800]  Yeah, for me, I work pretty much all the time,
[13:30.800 --> 13:32.520]  even when this isn't happening.
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.040]  I feel like I've had to really just come to tell myself
[13:39.040 --> 13:39.880]  and agree with myself.
[13:39.880 --> 13:41.480]  I love to work, I love what I do,
[13:41.480 --> 13:44.940]  and so either I'm thinking of ideas usually,
[13:44.940 --> 13:47.120]  or I'm writing something, or I'm producing a video,
[13:47.120 --> 13:49.400]  or I'm always thinking about the next thing I'm working on.
[13:49.400 --> 13:51.120]  I also do some management stuff
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.420]  at the journal with our video team,
[13:52.420 --> 13:55.560]  so I'm usually juggling a million projects at the same time.
[13:55.560 --> 13:58.560]  But I go to the office now,
[13:58.560 --> 14:00.920]  and I've been going to the office.
[14:00.920 --> 14:02.740]  There was a point in my life when I started at the journal
[14:02.740 --> 14:04.560]  where I would go maybe two or three times a week.
[14:04.560 --> 14:08.080]  I wouldn't go, but then I took on a management role
[14:08.080 --> 14:09.520]  in the video department a couple years ago,
[14:09.520 --> 14:11.120]  and I had to be there every day,
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.600]  and so I really got into this pattern of,
[14:13.600 --> 14:16.080]  I would go, even if I work super late hours,
[14:16.080 --> 14:18.360]  some days there, I don't come home till midnight,
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.480]  I'd take a car home or something like that.
[14:20.480 --> 14:24.000]  That delineation, just going to a place,
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.660]  makes a huge difference to me.
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.360]  Even if mentally I'm always working,
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.720]  or going to that place gives me that structure,
[14:31.720 --> 14:33.080]  now I have none of that,
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.060]  and I truly just feel like my life is on hold.
[14:37.060 --> 14:40.240]  I don't know when, where, and when things are happening.
[14:40.240 --> 14:43.120]  It is really, it is bizarre how it screws
[14:43.120 --> 14:45.440]  with your sense of time, where,
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.180]  and at both ways, and it's a meme,
[14:49.180 --> 14:51.620]  everybody's in it together, everybody agrees
[14:51.620 --> 14:56.200]  that March 2020 felt like it was around 300 days long.
[14:57.480 --> 15:00.040]  Yeah, I couldn't believe, I even looked at my stuff,
[15:00.040 --> 15:02.080]  I was like, wow, I did a lot of work this month.
[15:02.080 --> 15:05.420]  That month started with me reviewing the Galaxy S20.
[15:05.420 --> 15:08.300]  I was like, what, that phone came out this month?
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.320]  Or it was even like, I guess it came out
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.140]  at the very end of February.
[15:13.140 --> 15:17.460]  I'm like, what, that truly feels to me like a year ago.
[15:18.320 --> 15:21.640]  It feels like, I feel like the iPad Pro
[15:21.640 --> 15:24.920]  and MacBook Air announcement was a while ago,
[15:24.920 --> 15:27.740]  and even that was in the early days
[15:27.740 --> 15:29.200]  of the shelter in place stuff,
[15:29.200 --> 15:32.820]  because it was a remote presentation from Apple,
[15:32.820 --> 15:35.640]  and everything had to be shipped,
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.160]  we didn't meet with anybody face-to-face.
[15:37.160 --> 15:39.680]  It's like, that feels like forever ago.
[15:39.680 --> 15:40.520]  And it was like-
[15:40.520 --> 15:42.560]  I mean, I think that was three weeks ago now.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.060]  Yeah, it was like three weeks.
[15:47.420 --> 15:48.560]  Anyway.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.600]  Well, but very timely.
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.340]  I mean, and obviously you were going
[15:52.340 --> 15:54.520]  to review the MacBook Air.
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.760]  I mean, this is really right in every single way.
[15:58.760 --> 15:59.640]  And we can talk about the,
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.520]  we'll talk about the MacBook Air itself, but right aligned
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.880]  with your interests, right aligned with your advocacy
[16:08.880 --> 16:11.660]  on the keyboard issue and everything like that.
[16:11.660 --> 16:14.700]  But your video that accompanied it was specifically
[16:14.700 --> 16:19.700]  on the issue of, hey, the webcam on this thing stinks.
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.980]  And it's sort of an emblematic problem
[16:22.980 --> 16:25.260]  on laptops in general.
[16:25.260 --> 16:29.260]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I really,
[16:30.460 --> 16:34.260]  and it also just, I realized a blind spot in my reviewing.
[16:34.260 --> 16:37.140]  I had never, I went back and I searched for webcam
[16:37.140 --> 16:40.220]  on my other reviews, and I really had never mentioned it.
[16:41.620 --> 16:44.060]  Which, you know, it would have only been a line,
[16:44.060 --> 16:46.580]  something like, why does this thing stuck
[16:46.580 --> 16:47.420]  or something like that?
[16:47.420 --> 16:50.140]  Or it's still only 720p or something.
[16:51.580 --> 16:53.500]  But yeah, it's really quite bad.
[16:53.500 --> 16:56.300]  And again, the reason I noticed that was I was starting to,
[16:56.300 --> 16:58.260]  I've been trying to do a video a week still,
[16:58.260 --> 17:01.940]  try to keep up with my video fun.
[17:01.940 --> 17:04.780]  And I just started realizing, I was like, wow,
[17:04.780 --> 17:08.380]  like why would I ever shoot anything here with this webcam?
[17:08.380 --> 17:11.660]  And that got me on this path of looking at other laptops.
[17:11.660 --> 17:13.860]  And it was funny, I actually had to run to the office
[17:13.860 --> 17:15.980]  to go get some other laptops to compare to.
[17:15.980 --> 17:18.540]  Cause I was like, I can't just do this piece about Apple
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.620]  because it's not just Apple.
[17:20.620 --> 17:22.220]  Like I started looking at the specs and I was like,
[17:22.220 --> 17:25.820]  it's not just Apple, it's Microsoft is doing this, Dell,
[17:25.820 --> 17:28.660]  they're all using sort of low resolution webcams,
[17:28.660 --> 17:30.480]  at least low resolution for today.
[17:30.480 --> 17:33.020]  So I ran to my office, I got approval to enter the building.
[17:33.020 --> 17:35.320]  I wore my gloves, my mask.
[17:35.320 --> 17:37.820]  I basically risked my life to do this review for everybody.
[17:37.820 --> 17:39.500]  Okay, that's what I'm saying.
[17:39.500 --> 17:42.180]  And I got all, I got, you know, my office,
[17:42.180 --> 17:43.020]  I've got a ton of stuff.
[17:43.020 --> 17:44.820]  So I grab all my laptops and I said, you know what?
[17:44.820 --> 17:47.200]  I'm gonna grab this old Pro that I had here,
[17:47.200 --> 17:49.340]  this old MacBook Pro that I had here.
[17:49.340 --> 17:51.300]  And that was to me like, I was looking at them
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.380]  just to see if it still works.
[17:52.380 --> 17:54.100]  Cause I have all my old laptops there.
[17:54.100 --> 17:57.760]  My 10 year old MacBook Pro, when I compared the quality,
[17:57.760 --> 18:00.340]  it was shocking to me that in some conditions
[18:00.340 --> 18:02.240]  it's actually better than the new Air.
[18:02.240 --> 18:05.060]  I thought that was one of the most fascinating parts
[18:05.060 --> 18:10.060]  of the review because it totally jibed with my gut feeling
[18:10.660 --> 18:15.100]  of, you know, as much as we gripe about these webcam
[18:15.100 --> 18:16.900]  quality issues right now,
[18:16.900 --> 18:19.680]  doesn't it seem like they've actually gotten worse?
[18:19.680 --> 18:21.020]  And then in the back of my head, I think,
[18:21.020 --> 18:23.420]  ah, that's just one of those things that you think.
[18:23.420 --> 18:26.420]  And if you actually looked at a 10 year old webcam
[18:26.420 --> 18:28.500]  on a MacBook, you'd be shocked.
[18:28.500 --> 18:31.840]  But the truth is, especially in lower light situations,
[18:31.840 --> 18:35.440]  it wasn't just a little bit better, it was a lot better.
[18:35.440 --> 18:38.820]  Yeah, it was a lot better in the low light test.
[18:38.820 --> 18:41.520]  And I mean, even when I looked at,
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.600]  it didn't really come through that well in the video
[18:43.600 --> 18:45.620]  just because of compression and all of that stuff.
[18:45.620 --> 18:48.280]  But even like just this very grainy,
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.620]  this 720p camera on the Air.
[18:51.620 --> 18:53.560]  And even though you're getting better resolution,
[18:53.560 --> 18:55.300]  when you look at the quality next to each other,
[18:55.300 --> 18:57.320]  it's just, it's very grainy.
[18:57.320 --> 19:00.460]  And in some shots, that MacBook Pro looked like
[19:00.460 --> 19:02.620]  there were parts of my face that looked crisper,
[19:02.620 --> 19:05.660]  like just like looking around the glasses or my hair.
[19:05.660 --> 19:07.800]  I was just like, that is not pixelated.
[19:09.400 --> 19:13.360]  So 720p is pretty, that's pretty bad just on specs.
[19:13.360 --> 19:15.020]  That's outdated.
[19:15.020 --> 19:15.860]  Right.
[19:15.860 --> 19:19.540]  But I would say that the bigger problem,
[19:19.540 --> 19:22.660]  and it's easy, and I kind of feel like in a lot of reviews,
[19:22.660 --> 19:25.700]  that's just sort of how we've,
[19:25.700 --> 19:27.840]  we collectively in the reviewer industry
[19:27.840 --> 19:31.100]  have sort of been brushing this issue.
[19:31.100 --> 19:32.520]  It's at the end of the reviews,
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.560]  and if the review format for your publication
[19:35.560 --> 19:38.940]  has pros and cons, everybody remembers in the cons
[19:38.940 --> 19:43.500]  to stick in 720p webcam, isn't that great?
[19:43.500 --> 19:46.580]  Or it kind of stinks or whatever you want to say.
[19:46.580 --> 19:49.460]  And yeah, just on the spec alone, 720p,
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.940]  that's really low res.
[19:50.940 --> 19:54.100]  But the bigger issue, I would take a 720p camera
[19:54.100 --> 19:58.180]  if it had better lighting characteristics.
[19:58.180 --> 20:00.700]  It's, and the thing I run into too,
[20:00.700 --> 20:04.040]  so low light, any time after sun is, the sun is down,
[20:04.040 --> 20:06.060]  it's really, really bad.
[20:06.060 --> 20:07.980]  And we've been spoiled, like at this,
[20:07.980 --> 20:09.860]  you mentioned this and you compared the footage.
[20:09.860 --> 20:13.020]  We've got these phones in our pockets with us all the time,
[20:13.020 --> 20:14.880]  and you turn to pick the phone up
[20:14.880 --> 20:17.220]  and point it at your face in the exact same lighting
[20:17.220 --> 20:21.240]  and it gets a reasonable,
[20:21.240 --> 20:24.260]  and then when you compare it to the webcam, it's amazing.
[20:24.260 --> 20:26.260]  But the other problems that I've seen
[20:26.260 --> 20:28.600]  as I've done a lot more, even without colleagues,
[20:28.600 --> 20:31.060]  I've done a lot more video chats in the last few weeks.
[20:31.060 --> 20:33.420]  I just had a meeting before we recorded today
[20:33.420 --> 20:35.060]  with somebody for a product demo.
[20:36.340 --> 20:39.540]  Middle of the day, and it's actually kind of nice lighting.
[20:39.540 --> 20:41.380]  It's a little overcast here in Philly.
[20:41.380 --> 20:42.620]  It's probably the same in New York,
[20:42.620 --> 20:45.300]  but which makes for good lighting.
[20:45.300 --> 20:48.340]  And my desk in my home office is right next to a window,
[20:48.340 --> 20:51.040]  but the window's on the side, right?
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.100]  I'm not staring at the window, it's on my side.
[20:53.100 --> 20:55.580]  And with the MacBook Pro webcam,
[20:55.580 --> 20:57.380]  it's either half of my face,
[20:57.380 --> 21:01.380]  the one on the window, is completely blown out,
[21:01.380 --> 21:03.100]  or it gets a good,
[21:06.460 --> 21:07.300]  what's the word?
[21:07.300 --> 21:08.660]  Not white balance, but...
[21:08.660 --> 21:13.060]  Just like general balance?
[21:13.060 --> 21:14.540]  Yeah, it just gets a good balance
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.460]  on the light side of my face by the window,
[21:16.460 --> 21:17.660]  and then the other side of my face
[21:17.660 --> 21:19.980]  looks like I'm in a film noir,
[21:19.980 --> 21:22.220]  and it's just completely black.
[21:22.220 --> 21:24.060]  You can only see half my face.
[21:24.060 --> 21:25.900]  It just does not have a very...
[21:25.900 --> 21:27.060]  So you're Phantom of the Opera?
[21:27.060 --> 21:29.100]  Yeah, it just doesn't have the range.
[21:29.100 --> 21:30.260]  It just doesn't have the range
[21:30.260 --> 21:33.260]  to get both half lit, half shadow.
[21:33.260 --> 21:36.060]  Whereas every iPad or iPhone
[21:36.060 --> 21:39.900]  or any other modern phone
[21:39.900 --> 21:41.640]  is going to do a pretty good job
[21:41.640 --> 21:42.700]  in that sort of situation.
[21:42.700 --> 21:43.980]  You don't really think about it
[21:43.980 --> 21:47.060]  when you're using your phone as a selfie cam.
[21:47.060 --> 21:48.420]  You don't really think about the fact
[21:48.420 --> 21:49.980]  that the light is on half of your face.
[21:49.980 --> 21:54.740]  You just look at it, look pretty good, take a picture.
[21:54.740 --> 21:55.860]  Right.
[21:55.860 --> 21:59.940]  Yeah, I think the big question is what happens now?
[22:01.940 --> 22:03.460]  I think most laptop manufacturers
[22:03.460 --> 22:04.740]  will probably address this now,
[22:04.740 --> 22:07.100]  given that we've been using them so much,
[22:07.100 --> 22:08.820]  and people are really, really...
[22:08.820 --> 22:10.100]  I mean, The Verge had a piece yesterday
[22:10.100 --> 22:13.540]  which Nilay and I had been texting about last week as well,
[22:13.540 --> 22:15.060]  which was kind of pegged to this,
[22:15.060 --> 22:17.580]  which was that the Logitech cameras are sold out everywhere,
[22:17.580 --> 22:19.460]  and they're price gouged everywhere.
[22:20.780 --> 22:23.820]  Nilay tweeted he paid like 90 or, I don't know,
[22:23.820 --> 22:28.140]  over $100 for a $90 camera or something like that.
[22:28.140 --> 22:29.380]  I had a family friend text me being like,
[22:29.380 --> 22:30.220]  what are you talking about?
[22:30.220 --> 22:31.260]  These are not sold out.
[22:31.260 --> 22:33.180]  I'm gonna buy this on Amazon.
[22:33.180 --> 22:34.500]  I'm like, you're gonna buy a 300,
[22:34.500 --> 22:37.300]  you're gonna spend $300 for a $72 camera.
[22:38.420 --> 22:40.620]  And so I think laptop makers
[22:40.620 --> 22:42.420]  are going to look to address this.
[22:42.420 --> 22:44.420]  The question, I think, and you raised this in the post,
[22:44.420 --> 22:46.620]  is how much of it has to do with the physics
[22:46.620 --> 22:49.060]  and the mechanics of the system
[22:49.060 --> 22:50.220]  and the amount of area
[22:50.220 --> 22:53.780]  that they can squeeze these cameras into, plus price?
[22:53.780 --> 22:55.500]  How much is that gonna jack up
[22:55.500 --> 22:57.340]  some of the prices on some of this?
[22:57.340 --> 22:59.700]  Yeah, and I think that the physical space issue
[22:59.700 --> 23:02.060]  is too easy to overlook
[23:02.060 --> 23:04.380]  if you're just being casual about it,
[23:04.380 --> 23:07.180]  but if you really look at how thin
[23:07.180 --> 23:09.540]  like the new MacBook Air lid is,
[23:09.540 --> 23:12.340]  and it gets tapered up at the top so it's even thinner,
[23:12.340 --> 23:15.180]  and compare that to just how thick
[23:15.180 --> 23:19.020]  your iPhone or your iPad is,
[23:19.020 --> 23:21.940]  and combine it with the fact that
[23:21.940 --> 23:24.300]  without doing a little mini lesson here
[23:24.300 --> 23:27.220]  on the optical physics of cameras,
[23:29.380 --> 23:31.740]  it is not a coincidence
[23:31.740 --> 23:36.380]  that every single phone from every single manufacturer
[23:36.380 --> 23:38.620]  now has a camera bump of some sort.
[23:38.620 --> 23:40.900]  We don't even talk about camera bumps anymore
[23:40.900 --> 23:45.340]  because it's just accepted that the camera housing
[23:45.340 --> 23:47.660]  is going to stick out.
[23:47.660 --> 23:50.560]  Now, the front-facing cameras don't have bumps,
[23:52.340 --> 23:56.700]  but even so, the actual physical depth of the device
[23:56.700 --> 24:00.420]  from the front surface to as far away
[24:00.420 --> 24:03.400]  that the sensor can be is significantly,
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.520]  I know that compared to standalone camera cameras,
[24:08.380 --> 24:10.060]  they're all crazy thin,
[24:10.060 --> 24:11.740]  but it really does make a difference
[24:11.740 --> 24:13.800]  how thin laptop lids are.
[24:15.220 --> 24:17.260]  So I guess the big,
[24:17.260 --> 24:21.340]  I don't think anybody wants the entire lid of their laptop
[24:21.340 --> 24:23.220]  to be as thick as a tablet,
[24:23.220 --> 24:26.500]  but could we go with a bump?
[24:26.500 --> 24:29.900]  Mm-hmm, and I was also thinking,
[24:29.900 --> 24:33.220]  and another piece I wrote this week about Face ID,
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.820]  it's made me think, well,
[24:34.820 --> 24:37.380]  at least Windows has had facial recognition
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.660]  for a while on laptops,
[24:38.660 --> 24:40.780]  but Apple's never gone that route.
[24:40.780 --> 24:44.140]  And what could Face ID on a laptop bring
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.300]  that they haven't been able to bring
[24:45.300 --> 24:47.300]  with the fingerprint sensor?
[24:47.300 --> 24:51.700]  Yeah, and I wonder, again, how much of that is cost?
[24:51.700 --> 24:53.640]  It's gotta be somewhat of a factor,
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.640]  and how much of it is that the Face ID stuff needs Z depth,
[25:05.820 --> 25:08.340]  Z access depth to go deeper?
[25:08.340 --> 25:09.440]  I don't know, but-
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.440]  When you were saying that,
[25:11.440 --> 25:13.700]  I thought you meant like Z depth.
[25:14.540 --> 25:16.100]  I was putting on a French accent.
[25:16.100 --> 25:19.160]  Yeah, like Z if they want to Z you.
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.640]  But there's no good solution.
[25:23.640 --> 25:25.360]  I will say that it's,
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.520]  and I've been using ever since this trackpad thing came out,
[25:28.520 --> 25:32.420]  I have been doing, I'm kind of addicted to it,
[25:32.420 --> 25:33.920]  and all of a sudden without,
[25:33.920 --> 25:35.880]  I've already, yeah, for the iPad,
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.160]  I've already written my iPad Pro review.
[25:40.160 --> 25:41.360]  There wasn't really much to review.
[25:41.360 --> 25:44.020]  It's kind of a minor, really a speed bump update.
[25:45.060 --> 25:46.480]  But with this trackpad support,
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.280]  I'm doing a lot more work in my kitchen
[25:48.280 --> 25:50.960]  just to sort of not be locked in my home office
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.540]  all day every day during this thing.
[25:53.540 --> 25:55.880]  And rather than lug a MacBook around,
[25:55.880 --> 25:58.640]  I'm just using my iPad in the kitchen and my Mac
[25:58.640 --> 26:00.040]  and my desk in my office.
[26:02.120 --> 26:04.480]  But it emphasizes for me,
[26:04.480 --> 26:07.120]  like when I'm working on my iPad like this,
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.820]  sort of like a laptop, I've got the iPad sideways,
[26:10.820 --> 26:13.960]  and it just feels like the camera should be at the top
[26:13.960 --> 26:17.420]  when the iPad is horizontal.
[26:17.420 --> 26:19.960]  Right, so then the question would be,
[26:19.960 --> 26:22.500]  would they have to put two cameras in there?
[26:22.500 --> 26:23.960]  Or would they just move the camera?
[26:23.960 --> 26:27.660]  If we start, if we move to a pro situation
[26:27.660 --> 26:30.380]  where we're using it in much more horizontal situations,
[26:30.380 --> 26:32.140]  like you're saying, does it make sense
[26:32.140 --> 26:33.880]  just to move it there?
[26:33.880 --> 26:36.440]  Yeah, and then does it suddenly run into the issue
[26:36.440 --> 26:38.360]  that all the people who hold it
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.600]  in the vertical orientation,
[26:41.600 --> 26:43.980]  now their thumb is gonna be holding it all the time
[26:43.980 --> 26:45.120]  when they're holding it up?
[26:45.120 --> 26:45.960]  I don't know.
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.960]  I mean, there's no, like the upside of,
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.120]  especially tablets compared to phones,
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.120]  I feel like we rotate them a lot more.
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.860]  Yes, phones, ever since the iPhone, can rotate sideways.
[27:01.860 --> 27:03.160]  But for the most part, I mean,
[27:03.160 --> 27:05.280]  and now there's this whole quibby,
[27:05.280 --> 27:06.280]  I think that's how you pronounce it.
[27:06.280 --> 27:07.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:07.520 --> 27:09.760]  But people shoot lots of,
[27:09.760 --> 27:13.880]  people are so used to holding their phones vertically
[27:13.880 --> 27:16.160]  that they even shoot their video that way.
[27:19.580 --> 27:21.120]  Most people wouldn't even notice
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.800]  other than when they go to watch a horizontal video.
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.880]  That's the only time, or I guess to play a game.
[27:25.880 --> 27:26.720]  For the most part,
[27:26.720 --> 27:28.440]  people don't turn their phone sideways.
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.800]  Tablets, they turn all the time.
[27:30.800 --> 27:33.520]  And now that I've got this trackpad support,
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.200]  I'm turning my iPad sideways,
[27:37.200 --> 27:38.640]  turn it the other way, turn it the other way.
[27:38.640 --> 27:40.640]  I'm going back and forth all the time.
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.600]  And so there is no answer to where should the camera go.
[27:44.600 --> 27:45.440]  They've gotta make,
[27:45.440 --> 27:47.840]  I don't think they're gonna double up.
[27:47.840 --> 27:50.300]  It would increase the cost to some factor.
[27:50.300 --> 27:54.480]  And it seems needlessly duplicate
[27:54.480 --> 27:57.160]  to put two entirely different camera systems in there
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.560]  just so that there's always one in the center.
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.640]  But it sticks out the more you use your iPad
[28:03.640 --> 28:07.000]  in horizontal orientation.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.980]  Do you use Face ID on your iPad?
[28:08.980 --> 28:10.140]  Yeah, I love it.
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.400]  Yeah.
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.280]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like I don't use it as much,
[28:14.280 --> 28:17.240]  but yeah, I think I've just gotten
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.480]  into the habit of passwords on the iPad.
[28:20.480 --> 28:22.200]  I also have, I have not spent a lot of time
[28:22.200 --> 28:23.040]  with the new Pro.
[28:23.040 --> 28:23.880]  I mean, I have it here.
[28:23.880 --> 28:25.320]  I have it sitting next to the side of my bed.
[28:25.320 --> 28:26.680]  I've been using it at night.
[28:26.680 --> 28:27.680]  But yeah, to your point,
[28:27.680 --> 28:29.580]  I've been using it far more with that keyboard dock
[28:29.580 --> 28:32.680]  in horizontal than I have vertically.
[28:32.680 --> 28:35.680]  But I'm very excited when I get the magic,
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.880]  what is it, the magic keyboard?
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.160]  Is that what the?
[28:38.160 --> 28:40.520]  Yeah, unfortunately, they're just calling it
[28:40.520 --> 28:43.120]  the magic keyboard, which is the exact same name
[28:43.120 --> 28:46.280]  as the standalone, just plain Bluetooth keyboard.
[28:46.280 --> 28:49.680]  It's a very, it's a very Apple-like thing
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.560]  to just call it a magic keyboard,
[28:51.560 --> 28:55.240]  not the magic keyboard cover, not the magic keyboard case.
[28:55.240 --> 28:57.440]  It's just called the magic keyboard.
[28:57.440 --> 29:00.400]  I'm sort of calling it the magic keyboard cover
[29:00.400 --> 29:02.200]  just to keep it clear in my head,
[29:02.200 --> 29:04.740]  but it's not the official name.
[29:04.740 --> 29:06.880]  Yeah, so I think when I get that,
[29:06.880 --> 29:09.800]  I mean, I just imagine I'm gonna be using it,
[29:09.800 --> 29:12.080]  I don't know, 90% of the time horizontally.
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.360]  Yeah, me too.
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.320]  And it's funny because the new,
[29:15.320 --> 29:18.120]  the cases that are out, the smart keyboard case,
[29:18.120 --> 29:19.680]  the one that doesn't have a trackpad
[29:19.680 --> 29:22.800]  and just has the fabric-covered keyboard,
[29:22.800 --> 29:25.440]  for the first time, they put an Apple logo
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.920]  on the back of the cover,
[29:27.920 --> 29:30.640]  and the Apple logo is oriented such
[29:30.640 --> 29:33.760]  that the Apple logo looks correct
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.240]  when it's in the horizontal laptop configuration.
[29:38.240 --> 29:40.440]  So if you're holding it more like a book
[29:40.440 --> 29:42.920]  and fold the cover around,
[29:42.920 --> 29:45.280]  well, you cover up the Apple logo by covering,
[29:45.280 --> 29:46.700]  you know, by folding it around.
[29:46.700 --> 29:48.080]  So I guess that's one reason to do it.
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.940]  But I kind of feel like they were resistant
[29:49.940 --> 29:53.740]  to put Apple logos on those smart covers in the first place
[29:53.740 --> 29:56.140]  because they didn't want it to look, quote unquote,
[29:56.140 --> 29:58.600]  wrong half the time.
[29:58.600 --> 30:00.680]  Yeah, I've actually never noticed that.
[30:00.680 --> 30:03.200]  Yeah, all right, let me take a break here
[30:03.200 --> 30:04.720]  and thank our first sponsor.
[30:04.720 --> 30:06.600]  It's our good friends at Eero.
[30:06.600 --> 30:10.520]  Oh my God, everybody needs fast internet now at home.
[30:10.520 --> 30:14.180]  Well, Eero is the WiFi your home deserves.
[30:14.180 --> 30:19.180]  For a limited time, Eero Mesh WiFi starts at just 79 bucks.
[30:19.440 --> 30:20.560]  That's new.
[30:20.560 --> 30:22.800]  That's the lowest Eero has ever been
[30:22.800 --> 30:26.880]  that you can get started with an Eero kit, 79 bucks.
[30:26.880 --> 30:28.700]  Now, Eero blankets your whole home
[30:28.700 --> 30:30.120]  with fast, reliable WiFi,
[30:30.120 --> 30:32.840]  eliminating poor coverage, dead spots, and buffering.
[30:32.840 --> 30:35.640]  You'll have consistent, strong signal wherever you need it.
[30:35.640 --> 30:37.360]  And it sets up in just minutes.
[30:37.360 --> 30:39.400]  I know if you've never set one up,
[30:39.400 --> 30:40.960]  it sounds like that's too good to be true.
[30:40.960 --> 30:42.080]  It sounds like it's a nightmare
[30:42.080 --> 30:45.200]  to configure some kind of quote unquote mesh network.
[30:45.200 --> 30:47.360]  It really is that easy.
[30:47.360 --> 30:49.800]  It just plugs right into your modem, your modem,
[30:49.800 --> 30:51.520]  your cable box, whatever you've got
[30:51.520 --> 30:53.600]  where your actual internet comes into your house
[30:53.600 --> 30:56.260]  through a wire, you plug an Eero in there,
[30:56.260 --> 30:59.320]  you manage it from the really, really simple,
[30:59.320 --> 31:01.040]  well-designed Eero app,
[31:01.040 --> 31:03.840]  and it helps you plan where else in your house
[31:03.840 --> 31:06.080]  to put the extra Eeros,
[31:06.080 --> 31:07.520]  depending on how big your house is,
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.520]  how big your apartment is.
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.420]  And it really does work great.
[31:11.420 --> 31:13.040]  No more buffering with Netflix
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.560]  or whatever else you're streaming.
[31:14.560 --> 31:17.780]  You can get a really strong WiFi signal
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.880]  from the basement to the top floor,
[31:19.880 --> 31:21.920]  across walls, stuff like that.
[31:21.920 --> 31:23.080]  Really, really great.
[31:23.080 --> 31:24.120]  You're hearing me right now.
[31:24.120 --> 31:26.000]  Speak to you over an Eero network.
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.280]  I love it.
[31:27.280 --> 31:31.160]  You can get your home WiFi improved as soon as tomorrow.
[31:31.160 --> 31:32.800]  Right now, you can just pause this show.
[31:32.800 --> 31:36.080]  Go to ero.com slash the talk show
[31:36.080 --> 31:38.560]  and enter code the talk show at checkout
[31:38.560 --> 31:41.080]  and get free overnight shipping with your order.
[31:41.080 --> 31:43.680]  That's ero.com slash the talk show
[31:43.680 --> 31:46.120]  with code the talk show at checkout
[31:46.120 --> 31:49.280]  and get your Eero delivered with free shipping overnight.
[31:49.280 --> 31:52.320]  You've gotta use that URL though to get the special offer.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.880]  So I'll repeat it one last time,
[31:53.880 --> 31:58.040]  ero.com slash the talk show.
[31:58.040 --> 31:59.680]  We're talking Eero to Eero now too.
[31:59.680 --> 32:01.800]  I am on the Eero network.
[32:01.800 --> 32:03.800]  Do you have a window open or something?
[32:05.080 --> 32:06.480]  No, why is it that you hear something?
[32:06.480 --> 32:09.400]  Yeah, I hear something, like a little white noise.
[32:09.400 --> 32:10.400]  It's my laptop.
[32:11.280 --> 32:12.280]  Is it really?
[32:12.280 --> 32:14.840]  Yeah, so we can talk about this.
[32:14.840 --> 32:18.480]  We can talk about why this MacBook Pro makes that sound.
[32:18.480 --> 32:19.920]  Yeah, let's talk about it.
[32:19.920 --> 32:21.200]  Yeah, I mean, this was part of my,
[32:21.200 --> 32:24.560]  there was a couple of lines in the MacBook Air review,
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.560]  but I have just been finding that Chrome is,
[32:29.720 --> 32:31.480]  I mean, we've known this for a long time,
[32:31.480 --> 32:35.240]  but Chrome and the amount of stuff I do in Chrome,
[32:35.240 --> 32:37.760]  and apparently I have some sort of Chrome extension
[32:37.760 --> 32:38.760]  that runs in the background
[32:38.760 --> 32:43.240]  that uses an insane amount of CPU and memory.
[32:44.240 --> 32:46.840]  And so my laptop just constantly sounds like
[32:46.840 --> 32:51.840]  it's going to take off for outer space or something.
[32:52.080 --> 32:52.920]  I know.
[32:52.920 --> 32:54.960]  I mean, I could move the laptop across the room,
[32:54.960 --> 32:57.320]  but I'm plugged in with the mic to the laptop.
[32:58.240 --> 32:59.360]  Nah, just let it go.
[32:59.360 --> 33:00.200]  You know what I could do?
[33:00.200 --> 33:01.240]  I could close Chrome.
[33:01.240 --> 33:03.400]  That would be the biggest sacrifice of my life
[33:03.400 --> 33:04.440]  I could make for you.
[33:04.440 --> 33:06.240]  Yeah, do you need it while we talk?
[33:08.720 --> 33:11.280]  How else will I check my email during your ad spots?
[33:11.280 --> 33:14.840]  Check it on your phone.
[33:14.840 --> 33:16.320]  I'm closing Chrome for you.
[33:16.320 --> 33:17.160]  I've done it.
[33:17.160 --> 33:19.480]  This is the biggest sacrifice someone could make
[33:19.480 --> 33:21.400]  in life for you, John.
[33:21.400 --> 33:24.920]  And I bet you it's gonna go away soon.
[33:24.920 --> 33:27.920]  Our mutual friend, Walt Mossberg,
[33:27.920 --> 33:30.000]  had a tweet a week or two ago,
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.240]  something, I guess I could look it up,
[33:32.240 --> 33:35.120]  but basically he was just saying something to the effect of,
[33:35.120 --> 33:38.160]  hey, if you use Chrome, okay,
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.160]  but accept that it's going to use a lot more CPU resources
[33:43.160 --> 33:46.440]  and hog your battery and make your fan come on.
[33:46.440 --> 33:48.640]  And you should think about switching.
[33:48.640 --> 33:50.720]  And if you're on a Mac, you could switch to Safari.
[33:50.720 --> 33:52.120]  You could switch to Firefox
[33:52.120 --> 33:54.640]  if you're looking for something other than Safari.
[33:56.600 --> 33:57.960]  There's a lot of other options.
[33:57.960 --> 33:59.680]  There are other options out there.
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.880]  And it's just a different set of,
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.120]  and people love Chrome.
[34:05.120 --> 34:08.200]  Chrome has some features that other browsers just don't have.
[34:08.200 --> 34:10.760]  They have that extension ecosystem.
[34:10.760 --> 34:13.640]  And I hear it all the time.
[34:13.640 --> 34:14.840]  Whenever I bring it up,
[34:14.840 --> 34:17.000]  I always get responses from people who are like,
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.280]  you know, I'd like to leave Chrome because I understand,
[34:20.280 --> 34:23.280]  I see what it does to the battery or something like that.
[34:23.280 --> 34:25.720]  But they'll say, and the but often involves,
[34:25.720 --> 34:27.720]  but there's like these two extensions
[34:27.720 --> 34:29.240]  that I just can't live without.
[34:29.240 --> 34:32.280]  And they're not available for other browsers.
[34:32.280 --> 34:33.240]  And that's the trade-off.
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.320]  You know, it's like so much of technology is,
[34:36.320 --> 34:39.320]  like what we do is writing about trade-offs.
[34:39.320 --> 34:41.800]  Yep, yep, and I've felt the same way.
[34:41.800 --> 34:43.680]  And I have to hand it to the Safari team.
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.800]  Anytime I write about why I can't go to Safari,
[34:46.800 --> 34:48.960]  and I'll give like a couple of reasons why,
[34:49.920 --> 34:51.040]  I don't want to say they do it for me.
[34:51.040 --> 34:52.520]  I'm sure they do it for a lot of people,
[34:52.520 --> 34:55.040]  but they end up solving a lot of those problems.
[34:55.040 --> 34:56.600]  For me, one of the last holdout issues
[34:56.600 --> 34:58.480]  that I was having was the favicons.
[34:59.360 --> 35:01.280]  It was one of the things about Chrome that was just like,
[35:01.280 --> 35:02.840]  I could instantly know what app
[35:02.840 --> 35:04.920]  or what website I was on with the favicons.
[35:04.920 --> 35:06.560]  And they built that into Safari and I was like,
[35:06.560 --> 35:08.120]  okay, I'm gonna switch over to Safari.
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.520]  I finally got it.
[35:09.520 --> 35:12.200]  Like, I think it was like maybe two WWCs ago
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.960]  they announced that.
[35:13.960 --> 35:15.080]  I think it was-
[35:15.080 --> 35:16.200]  I forget the timing on that.
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.040]  I had a little effort in that.
[35:18.040 --> 35:18.880]  It was in Catalina.
[35:18.880 --> 35:21.720]  I think, maybe we talked about, I mean, I'm sure,
[35:23.200 --> 35:25.240]  no one can take sole credit for it,
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.120]  but probably you could.
[35:28.120 --> 35:30.280]  And so I was like, I'm gonna switch over.
[35:30.280 --> 35:33.800]  And then I switch over and I do so much in Google,
[35:33.800 --> 35:37.000]  Google Docs with Gmail, with Drive.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.480]  It just works better in Chrome.
[35:38.480 --> 35:39.320]  And so I like say,
[35:39.320 --> 35:41.880]  okay, I'm gonna just keep Chrome open for those things.
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.000]  But then managing two browsers is like a ridiculous thing
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.040]  where you don't know which one
[35:46.040 --> 35:47.400]  and you need to set a default
[35:47.400 --> 35:49.080]  because then you're clicking from one app to another
[35:49.080 --> 35:50.600]  and you're in three different browsers
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.600]  or two different browsers.
[35:52.600 --> 35:56.120]  And so I do, I need to just be able to say, you know what?
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.760]  I'm just gonna use Safari.
[35:57.760 --> 36:01.080]  And I will maybe just use something like Firefox
[36:01.080 --> 36:03.840]  or something like that as an all to Chrome
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.880]  for certain things.
[36:04.880 --> 36:07.120]  But it's a big move.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.840]  It's like a life-changing move.
[36:08.840 --> 36:10.800]  For anybody who doesn't know the backstory,
[36:10.800 --> 36:13.080]  favicons, favicons, I don't know how you pronounce it,
[36:13.080 --> 36:15.160]  but favicons are the little site icons.
[36:15.160 --> 36:17.440]  So you go to the wallstreetjournal.com,
[36:17.440 --> 36:19.680]  there's a little icon with the Wall Street Journal logo.
[36:19.680 --> 36:20.840]  You go to Daring Fireball,
[36:20.840 --> 36:24.080]  there's a little Daring Fireball logo in the URL bar.
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.480]  And in most browsers, every browser except Safari,
[36:28.480 --> 36:30.080]  when you open tabs,
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.360]  it's the little icon that represents the site
[36:33.360 --> 36:35.320]  and it's in the tab and then the more tabs
[36:35.320 --> 36:38.880]  you open in a window, the smaller each tab gets,
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.800]  which means that less text of the name of the tab can show
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.440]  and the icons become the only way
[36:45.440 --> 36:48.160]  to really identify which tab is which.
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.160]  And insanely to me, Safari had no option,
[36:53.480 --> 36:55.880]  not even an option to show these icons
[36:55.880 --> 36:58.960]  until like a year and a half ago,
[36:58.960 --> 37:00.720]  maybe it was two years ago at this point.
[37:00.720 --> 37:04.920]  It's trying to look, but I complained about it
[37:04.920 --> 37:09.160]  and I got some feedback from people on the Safari team
[37:09.160 --> 37:10.520]  who were like, you know what?
[37:10.520 --> 37:13.280]  This has been, we're aware of this,
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.640]  this has been a battle inside.
[37:15.640 --> 37:17.920]  I don't know the inside story of who,
[37:17.920 --> 37:21.000]  but apparently, obviously it wasn't like Apple
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.120]  wasn't aware of the issue.
[37:22.120 --> 37:27.120]  There is some, either a person or a small caterer
[37:27.120 --> 37:31.720]  of people within Apple who did not want support
[37:31.720 --> 37:34.200]  for these icons in Safari because they thought
[37:34.200 --> 37:37.120]  it would look bad to have all these random icons
[37:37.120 --> 37:39.800]  and colors in breaking up the beauty
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.800]  of Safari's monochrome appearance.
[37:43.800 --> 37:47.000]  And that's partially why, you know how like
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.760]  when you do a pinned tab, I never use,
[37:49.760 --> 37:51.240]  I don't like the pinned tab feature,
[37:51.240 --> 37:52.920]  but I know some people love it.
[37:52.920 --> 37:55.480]  But Safari implemented its own standard
[37:55.480 --> 37:59.480]  for pinned tabs where they use, literally enforce
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.280]  a monochromatic icon so that the icon
[38:03.280 --> 38:05.680]  is just a black and white image
[38:05.680 --> 38:07.280]  and then I guess they color it in gray.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.640]  So it's just a shape, not color.
[38:09.640 --> 38:12.280]  And I think that that was a concession
[38:12.280 --> 38:15.120]  to the same people who didn't want the favicons
[38:15.120 --> 38:17.160]  in the regular tabs because they didn't,
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.560]  they thought the color, any random site's color
[38:20.560 --> 38:22.080]  is like, oh my God, you're at CNN.
[38:22.080 --> 38:23.400]  Now you've got this red icon.
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.400]  It clashes with the beauty of this other tab's icon,
[38:28.720 --> 38:30.320]  which is, it's crazy, right?
[38:30.320 --> 38:31.160]  I mean like.
[38:31.160 --> 38:32.000]  That's fascinating.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.760]  I never knew this side of the story.
[38:33.760 --> 38:35.200]  I mean, I guess it makes sense.
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.040]  I may not be expressing the argument against favicons well
[38:40.040 --> 38:41.680]  because it doesn't make any sense to me.
[38:41.680 --> 38:44.680]  But basically they thought it was ugly, I guess,
[38:44.680 --> 38:46.680]  and that they couldn't, and that somebody
[38:46.680 --> 38:48.600]  had the political clout to keep the feature
[38:48.600 --> 38:50.160]  from being added.
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.800]  And me publicly writing about it,
[38:53.800 --> 38:55.200]  I think you complain.
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.720]  I mean, we certainly aren't the only two tech pundits
[38:57.720 --> 38:58.880]  who were complaining about it,
[38:58.880 --> 39:01.120]  but I really kind of went all in on it.
[39:01.120 --> 39:01.960]  And it was like.
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.360]  I remember this now, yeah.
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.680]  And I guess the thing that I found out
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.400]  and that I was told would be very influential
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.360]  was that I shared the number of people
[39:12.360 --> 39:14.800]  who either listen to my show or read my site
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.000]  who wrote to me and said, in all sincerity,
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.200]  I would switch to Safari except for the no icons
[39:22.200 --> 39:23.560]  and tabs thing.
[39:23.560 --> 39:26.840]  So it wasn't even down to extensions or other factors
[39:26.840 --> 39:29.720]  that might keep them on Chrome or Firefox or something.
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.000]  It was literally I have 20 tabs open at a time.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.160]  I can't tell what they are without icons,
[39:35.160 --> 39:37.200]  so I can't switch to Safari.
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.000]  And that apparently was a compelling argument
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.400]  that kind of broke the log jam within Apple
[39:43.400 --> 39:44.960]  and was like, look, we're actually,
[39:44.960 --> 39:47.840]  our refusal to put icons in the tabs
[39:47.840 --> 39:50.920]  is actually keeping people from using Safari.
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.080]  And they're like, okay.
[39:52.080 --> 39:52.920]  But even as.
[39:52.920 --> 39:54.200]  Emery, I mean, I'm looking at your piece.
[39:54.200 --> 39:56.520]  You wrote it in August 2017.
[39:56.520 --> 39:59.640]  Right, and so I think that it happened.
[39:59.640 --> 40:00.600]  I forget when it happened.
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.480]  Boy, that feels like a long time ago, August 2017.
[40:04.480 --> 40:07.160]  I mean, to be fair, yesterday feels like three years ago.
[40:07.160 --> 40:08.000]  So.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.840]  So I forget when they actually fixed it.
[40:11.040 --> 40:13.120]  It was like about two years ago.
[40:13.120 --> 40:13.960]  That makes sense.
[40:13.960 --> 40:16.080]  It was before Catalina, so.
[40:16.080 --> 40:18.840]  I want to say like the summer of 2018.
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.280]  Yes, because I remember them announcing it at WBC
[40:21.280 --> 40:22.920]  and me like wanting to clap.
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.080]  Yeah, yes.
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.080]  I wanted to like storm the stage, go up and like.
[40:27.080 --> 40:30.280]  But here's the funny thing is that they did embrace it,
[40:30.280 --> 40:31.320]  but only to a degree.
[40:31.320 --> 40:34.080]  This is still something you have to go turn on.
[40:34.080 --> 40:36.360]  Exactly, it's still off by default.
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.560]  And so like when I was setting up this new Mac,
[40:39.560 --> 40:41.720]  I was like, oh, freaking with the favicons again.
[40:41.720 --> 40:43.880]  And I was like, I go to Google, had to turn it on.
[40:43.880 --> 40:45.120]  And it's like, okay, it's super easy.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.560]  You just go to preferences and tabs and turn it on.
[40:47.560 --> 40:49.000]  But I'm like, why do I have to do that?
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.840]  Right, it still seems, and again,
[40:53.200 --> 40:56.760]  that there still is that contingent within.
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.840]  I don't know who the people are, honestly.
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.760]  And I realize normal people don't change the defaults.
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.120]  The default preferences for any sort of software
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.160]  are so important because so few people think to change them.
[41:12.160 --> 41:13.120]  And they shouldn't, right?
[41:13.120 --> 41:16.760]  That's just, that's the whole point of personal technology
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.440]  is that the stuff should.
[41:19.400 --> 41:20.240]  Work.
[41:20.240 --> 41:25.240]  Just work out of the box to the best degree as possible.
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.600]  I still think, I don't wanna complain
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.560]  because they did add the feature, but I will complain.
[41:30.560 --> 41:32.600]  I don't wanna do it, but I have to do it.
[41:32.600 --> 41:35.640]  But I still think that default should be that they're on.
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.520]  I mean, it has to be that any reasonable person
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.160]  who uses more than one tab at a time
[41:43.160 --> 41:46.400]  would like to have the icons in the tabs.
[41:46.400 --> 41:48.360]  It just seems crazy.
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.480]  I'm totally with you on that.
[41:49.480 --> 41:50.680]  But if I complain and then I'm like,
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.000]  well, if they do this, then I'll switch from Chrome,
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.640]  I'd be lying.
[41:55.640 --> 41:59.400]  Chrome lets you really get tiny, tiny tabs too.
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.400]  I mean, it's an interesting user interface debate and study.
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.400]  And if I were teaching a course on user interface design,
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.120]  I would love to do a whole segment of the class.
[42:14.120 --> 42:17.320]  Let's just think about how tabs work in a browser
[42:17.320 --> 42:19.120]  and compare the implementations
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.160]  from a couple of popular browsers
[42:21.160 --> 42:23.520]  because it's a very specific feature.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.480]  If you don't really think about it, you might think,
[42:25.480 --> 42:27.120]  ah, they're all mostly the same.
[42:27.120 --> 42:31.160]  They're tabs, you can close them, you can move them around,
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.640]  you can get them in the browser.
[42:32.640 --> 42:35.800]  You can move them around, you can drag them out to Windows.
[42:35.800 --> 42:37.920]  But there's some really interesting differences in there.
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.320]  And one of the, I think a really big difference
[42:40.320 --> 42:44.880]  is that Chrome will keep shrinking the tabs
[42:44.880 --> 42:47.080]  to the size of an icon practically
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.800]  before it does something else
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.320]  to more or less make the tab bar a scrollable region.
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.920]  Whereas Safari, I'm talking about the Mac here on desktop,
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.640]  but the iPad version of Safari is a lot like,
[43:03.640 --> 43:06.200]  the tabs are a lot like the Mac version.
[43:06.200 --> 43:08.040]  Like obviously on the phone, they're different
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.240]  because they're not really tabs at all on the phone.
[43:11.240 --> 43:13.600]  They're these browser windows
[43:13.600 --> 43:15.880]  that sort of scroll up and down.
[43:17.040 --> 43:19.000]  Let's leave the phone aside for now.
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.800]  The minimum width of a tab in Safari is,
[43:23.800 --> 43:27.200]  I'm gonna say here, maybe about an inch and a half,
[43:27.200 --> 43:29.160]  something like physically,
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.840]  it's definitely more than an inch.
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.840]  Whereas Chrome will let you shrink it down
[43:34.840 --> 43:36.840]  to just like a quarter of an inch
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.200]  where it's really just a little thing with the icon.
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.920]  Right, where it's just the favicon.
[43:41.920 --> 43:42.760]  Right.
[43:42.760 --> 43:43.600]  And I have-
[43:43.600 --> 43:44.640]  So by the way, I looked it up.
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.640]  They enabled this in Safari 12 in 2018.
[43:50.240 --> 43:51.080]  Huh, what-
[43:51.080 --> 43:52.120]  So it was two years ago.
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.040]  Yeah, tabs, Safari 12, there we go.
[43:55.040 --> 43:56.920]  Thank you, Safari team.
[43:56.920 --> 43:57.840]  Yeah.
[43:57.840 --> 43:59.360]  Yeah, and we don't mean, we are thankful.
[43:59.360 --> 44:00.680]  We don't mean to complain,
[44:00.680 --> 44:03.680]  but we also could keep complaining.
[44:03.680 --> 44:04.520]  Yeah.
[44:04.520 --> 44:05.360]  Yeah.
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.480]  All right, so I guess we should go back to the MacBook Air.
[44:12.400 --> 44:14.200]  Your review of the MacBook Air.
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.160]  I thought it was, I was waiting for it.
[44:18.160 --> 44:19.480]  I was waiting for your review
[44:19.480 --> 44:20.840]  to see what you'd have to say.
[44:20.840 --> 44:23.120]  I suspected you would like the keyboard,
[44:24.200 --> 44:25.040]  but basically-
[44:25.040 --> 44:25.880]  I did.
[44:25.880 --> 44:28.160]  You know, your conclusion was, you know,
[44:28.160 --> 44:30.840]  not to put words in your mouth, but this is the laptop.
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.760]  If you're gonna get a Mac laptop,
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.240]  this is the one most people should buy.
[44:35.240 --> 44:37.160]  Yeah, even though I'm not buying it,
[44:37.160 --> 44:40.520]  which goes back to this Chrome thing, by the way.
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.800]  So, and I had a couple of lines in there,
[44:42.800 --> 44:45.880]  but I realized through writing this piece
[44:45.880 --> 44:49.080]  that I'm actually more of a pro user now than I ever was.
[44:49.080 --> 44:50.960]  I've been doing a lot of heavy video work,
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.880]  and I use Chrome, and that is another thing.
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.160]  And I find that I'm just, even on this 16-inch pro,
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.000]  sometimes tapping out the CPU and memory
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.400]  with the amount of things I'm doing in Chrome.
[45:06.400 --> 45:07.680]  But between audio, video,
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.120]  sometimes I've got Photoshop open, I've got Premiere open,
[45:10.120 --> 45:10.960]  I've got a bunch of stuff,
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.640]  and I just, it was too much for the Air,
[45:13.640 --> 45:15.160]  even though I love that machine.
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.040]  And it was also, again, kind of the circumstances
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.000]  of reviewing it right now,
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.960]  I just want this kind of desktop replacement laptop
[45:23.960 --> 45:25.960]  in my life right now, because I'm not commuting.
[45:25.960 --> 45:30.640]  I have not even seen my backpack now for, I don't know,
[45:31.520 --> 45:33.400]  weeks, I miss my backpack.
[45:33.400 --> 45:35.800]  I miss so many things about my old life.
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.080]  But, so it might be a little bit of that.
[45:40.080 --> 45:43.200]  But I am holding out for this 14-inch,
[45:43.200 --> 45:45.720]  the 13-inch replacement model.
[45:45.720 --> 45:48.840]  I think that's gonna be the Goldilocks for me,
[45:48.840 --> 45:50.280]  just right.
[45:50.280 --> 45:51.880]  I think so for me too.
[45:54.280 --> 45:57.480]  I still love, I'm using it right now,
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.480]  I still love my 2014, 2015, 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[46:06.160 --> 46:08.600]  I really do love, no, 2014, I always forget,
[46:08.600 --> 46:10.440]  this is like the third time on my podcast
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.320]  where I've forgotten just how old this MacBook Pro is.
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.240]  It's mid-2014, so it's almost six years old at this point.
[46:18.240 --> 46:19.960]  It's like five and a half years old.
[46:19.960 --> 46:23.160]  Still is a fantastic little machine.
[46:23.160 --> 46:24.700]  I love the size.
[46:26.160 --> 46:28.680]  And the Air for me is the same way.
[46:28.680 --> 46:31.200]  And it's even just using, even using Safari,
[46:31.200 --> 46:32.520]  I can't even complain about Chrome.
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.100]  But if you are like me, and don't close,
[46:38.200 --> 46:40.320]  I don't really close tabs, I just,
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.000]  if I feel like my window has gotten too crowded with tabs,
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.360]  my way of declaring tab bankruptcy
[46:45.360 --> 46:47.320]  isn't to close everything or clean it up.
[46:47.320 --> 46:50.760]  I just make a new window and start piling up tabs.
[46:50.760 --> 46:52.560]  So you just leave the tabs in the background?
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.820]  Yeah, more or less, until maybe once every two weeks,
[46:56.820 --> 47:01.240]  then I'll go and actually, all right, I gotta figure,
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.160]  I gotta do something here because my,
[47:03.160 --> 47:05.600]  when Safari makes your fan go on,
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.500]  then you know you have too many tabs.
[47:09.240 --> 47:11.720]  But I don't really clean it up until then.
[47:11.720 --> 47:13.520]  But also sometimes, do you find that,
[47:13.520 --> 47:15.540]  do you get that alert sometimes where if you're,
[47:15.540 --> 47:18.640]  use Gmail, right, or Google Mail?
[47:18.640 --> 47:20.940]  Yeah, but I don't use it through the Gmail interface
[47:20.940 --> 47:22.120]  for the most part.
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.440]  I usually use it through the Mail interface.
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.240]  So I don't really leave Gmail open.
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.240]  And the other trick I have is for privacy reasons
[47:31.520 --> 47:34.760]  and for, it just seems to work better,
[47:34.760 --> 47:36.280]  I more or less use Chrome.
[47:36.280 --> 47:37.900]  I don't use Chrome for regular browsing,
[47:37.900 --> 47:40.140]  but I use Chrome for anything Google related,
[47:40.140 --> 47:41.440]  other than YouTube.
[47:41.440 --> 47:44.520]  So YouTube, but you can't avoid just using.
[47:44.520 --> 47:47.960]  But I keep, but if I actually want to use
[47:47.960 --> 47:50.800]  the Gmail web interface for Gmail,
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.400]  I actually fire up Chrome and it automatically reopens
[47:55.400 --> 47:57.500]  all my Gmail accounts into tabs in Chrome,
[47:57.500 --> 47:59.400]  and I just go through it there.
[47:59.400 --> 48:01.900]  Right, but that, yeah, that's the nightmare
[48:01.900 --> 48:03.660]  of trying to do that and balance that.
[48:03.660 --> 48:05.600]  Because then if you're clicking into things from Chrome,
[48:05.600 --> 48:07.620]  from Chrome and in your Gmail,
[48:07.620 --> 48:09.480]  then you're getting kicked back to Chrome.
[48:09.480 --> 48:11.360]  You're not going back to Safari.
[48:11.360 --> 48:13.600]  That's what, I've been trying to manage the two browsers
[48:13.600 --> 48:16.480]  for, well, for weeks or months or whatever.
[48:16.480 --> 48:18.040]  And it just, it's sort of a nightmare.
[48:18.040 --> 48:19.480]  You've got to commit to one.
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.840]  But yeah, I mean, I love the Air.
[48:25.840 --> 48:26.960]  I think it's a great system.
[48:26.960 --> 48:29.620]  I heard from many readers who were super excited
[48:29.620 --> 48:32.200]  to finally be able to get rid of their old Air
[48:32.200 --> 48:35.120]  and who were waiting and waiting and waiting
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.120]  because they had read all about the keyboard situation
[48:37.120 --> 48:38.400]  and said, no way, no way.
[48:38.400 --> 48:40.600]  And so they finally felt really good.
[48:40.600 --> 48:42.200]  And I felt really confident in saying,
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.320]  finally, you can get this machine.
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.480]  But yeah, for me, I'm actually still stuck
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.540]  with my old Air for my actual computer,
[48:52.540 --> 48:55.060]  though I've been using the 16-inch MacBook Pro loaner
[48:55.060 --> 48:56.500]  on and off because I really wanted
[48:56.500 --> 48:58.720]  to test the keyboard over time.
[48:58.720 --> 48:59.560]  Yeah, same here.
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.740]  That's why I'm still using the 16-inch review unit.
[49:02.740 --> 49:05.040]  I find that the keyboard, I thought this was interesting.
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.800]  And I don't know, again, it seems like the sort of thing
[49:09.800 --> 49:11.520]  where maybe it's the placebo effect
[49:11.520 --> 49:13.520]  and I'm feeling what I wanna feel,
[49:13.520 --> 49:15.000]  but I feel like it's, if anything,
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.920]  it's gotten better over time.
[49:16.920 --> 49:18.120]  Yeah, I said that too.
[49:18.120 --> 49:21.100]  Yeah, I don't think it's just my imagination.
[49:22.020 --> 49:24.600]  It just feels like, unlike the butterfly key,
[49:24.600 --> 49:27.920]  which tends to get stuck over time,
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.640]  it feels like the new scissor switch one,
[49:31.640 --> 49:34.120]  it just sort of breaks, it wears in,
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.660]  but it's not like the keys have gotten wobbly in any way.
[49:37.660 --> 49:39.440]  They're not wobbly.
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.440]  It just feels like a very, very nice keyboard to type on,
[49:44.440 --> 49:45.280]  which seems like-
[49:45.280 --> 49:46.240]  Yeah, as I said in my review,
[49:46.240 --> 49:49.600]  I said it feels like this is broken in versus broken.
[49:49.600 --> 49:51.920]  Right, oh, man, you're a good writer.
[49:51.920 --> 49:53.000]  That's a good line.
[49:53.000 --> 49:53.960]  That one just came to me,
[49:53.960 --> 49:57.000]  and I just felt like I had to do a live reading right here,
[49:57.000 --> 49:57.840]  right now for it.
[49:57.840 --> 50:00.680]  But yeah, I feel the same way.
[50:00.680 --> 50:04.740]  The 16-inch just feels, I love writing on it.
[50:04.740 --> 50:06.960]  For some reason, I'm just like I can,
[50:06.960 --> 50:08.600]  and it's not for some reason.
[50:08.600 --> 50:11.600]  I will use my other air for some of my other work stuff,
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.400]  because it has all my programs on it and stuff,
[50:15.400 --> 50:16.680]  like expenses or whatever.
[50:16.680 --> 50:17.860]  I just kind of always go back to it.
[50:17.860 --> 50:20.720]  But if I'm writing, I've written the last,
[50:20.720 --> 50:22.520]  like, I don't know, last six months,
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.660]  five months of columns, scripts.
[50:24.660 --> 50:26.840]  I've worked on this long video project,
[50:26.840 --> 50:28.980]  all been on the 16-inch air.
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.160]  I think, you know, and it's funny because-
[50:32.160 --> 50:34.760]  I'm sorry, 16-inch MacBook Pro, not air.
[50:34.760 --> 50:36.800]  Well, it's the only 16-inch product,
[50:36.800 --> 50:39.160]  so I knew what you were talking about.
[50:39.160 --> 50:41.960]  It seems like so long ago,
[50:41.960 --> 50:43.160]  and I mention this all the time,
[50:43.160 --> 50:46.800]  but I can't help but do it when I go to,
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.680]  well, when I used to go to a coffee shop,
[50:49.680 --> 50:51.700]  or I'd be going through an airport,
[50:51.700 --> 50:54.080]  or walking, like, I'm on an airplane,
[50:54.080 --> 50:55.120]  and I'm traveling somewhere,
[50:55.120 --> 50:58.120]  and I have to go to the restroom, and I walk back.
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.360]  I just look at what people are using,
[51:00.360 --> 51:02.600]  and I always, you know, I just see, like, oh, there's-
[51:02.600 --> 51:03.440]  Me too, yeah.
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.160]  It's Apple, you know, it's one of those things
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.720]  Apple is secretive about for competitive reasons.
[51:09.720 --> 51:12.440]  They don't break down the model numbers and say,
[51:12.440 --> 51:16.320]  you know, 67% of our MacBooks were MacBook Airs,
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.120]  and 33% were MacBook Pros,
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.260]  and the MacBook Pros were split this way
[51:22.260 --> 51:23.680]  between the big one and the small one.
[51:23.680 --> 51:24.500]  They don't tell you.
[51:24.500 --> 51:26.520]  They just say, they don't even tell you MacBooks.
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.400]  They just, they don't even break down portables
[51:28.400 --> 51:29.420]  for desktops anymore.
[51:29.420 --> 51:32.080]  They just say, we sold four million Macs last quarter,
[51:32.080 --> 51:35.640]  and that's it, but eyeballing it,
[51:35.640 --> 51:39.120]  when we used to be able to go out and see other people
[51:39.120 --> 51:40.800]  and what they're using,
[51:40.800 --> 51:44.600]  I just feel like Apple did tell us,
[51:44.600 --> 51:47.240]  when the new MacBook Air came out,
[51:47.240 --> 51:49.800]  those three very long weeks ago,
[51:49.800 --> 51:52.880]  they did tell us that it was their most popular Mac,
[51:53.760 --> 51:56.780]  but I feel like even that is underselling
[51:56.780 --> 52:01.280]  by what degree the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac.
[52:01.280 --> 52:06.000]  It's just, anecdotally, it just feels like
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.760]  that is what people think of when they think of a Mac.
[52:08.760 --> 52:09.760]  If you're gonna buy a Mac,
[52:09.760 --> 52:11.800]  people just, they don't even look at anything else.
[52:11.800 --> 52:13.460]  They know they don't wanna spend the extra money
[52:13.460 --> 52:15.080]  on a MacBook Pro.
[52:15.080 --> 52:17.660]  They know they want a portable, for the most part,
[52:17.660 --> 52:18.500]  you know, and if you don't,
[52:18.500 --> 52:20.060]  if you really do want a desktop,
[52:20.060 --> 52:22.000]  you can get the iMac, and it's a great machine,
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  and I'm sure they, you know,
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.600]  it's not like they sell no iMacs,
[52:25.600 --> 52:27.720]  but for the most part, most people want a laptop,
[52:27.720 --> 52:29.600]  and if they want a laptop, they want the Air,
[52:29.600 --> 52:32.440]  and it's so easy to eyeball it
[52:32.440 --> 52:34.520]  because of the teardrop shape, right?
[52:34.520 --> 52:37.640]  You don't have to like get real close and creep on somebody.
[52:37.640 --> 52:42.640]  It's a very distinctive profile, and you can see it,
[52:43.280 --> 52:47.540]  and it's been, for something that's so popular
[52:47.540 --> 52:50.420]  and so essential to so many people's lives,
[52:50.420 --> 52:53.300]  it has been such a very strange transition
[52:53.300 --> 52:56.780]  to go from the old pre-retina MacBook Airs
[52:56.780 --> 52:58.760]  when they were recommendable,
[52:58.760 --> 53:01.680]  like, you know, five, six, seven years ago.
[53:01.680 --> 53:03.920]  I mean, I spent half my career recommending that.
[53:03.920 --> 53:06.860]  Right, and it's just been a very strange transition,
[53:06.860 --> 53:11.860]  and I don't think that the 2018 MacBook Airs were bad,
[53:12.080 --> 53:15.000]  and especially when they did the
[53:16.760 --> 53:21.760]  interim third-generation butterfly switch update,
[53:21.800 --> 53:24.600]  which, you know, again, to give you credit,
[53:24.600 --> 53:27.680]  I think was largely inspired internally
[53:27.680 --> 53:32.440]  by the, I called it last year the Column of the Year.
[53:32.440 --> 53:33.920]  I still think it's gonna go down.
[53:33.920 --> 53:35.520]  It should probably get credit
[53:35.520 --> 53:38.920]  as the Personal Technology Column of the Decade.
[53:38.920 --> 53:40.240]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[53:41.400 --> 53:42.360]  That's the award.
[53:42.360 --> 53:44.080]  I don't know if they, they probably didn't submit it
[53:44.080 --> 53:45.160]  for any awards at the journal,
[53:45.160 --> 53:47.680]  but this is the award that matters the most to me, John,
[53:47.680 --> 53:48.960]  so thank you.
[53:48.960 --> 53:50.160]  Can you send me a Gruber?
[53:50.160 --> 53:51.920]  It's like a Gruber award, a thing?
[53:51.920 --> 53:53.280]  You should do that.
[53:53.280 --> 53:54.120]  Send me a Gruber.
[53:54.120 --> 53:59.120]  It's a 3D-printed bust of you.
[53:59.280 --> 54:00.680]  Oh, would it be a bust of me,
[54:00.680 --> 54:04.480]  or would it be just like a sphere with a star on it?
[54:04.480 --> 54:07.880]  Oh yeah, that could be, it could be your favicon, sure.
[54:07.880 --> 54:09.960]  Maybe it's the size of a favicon.
[54:09.960 --> 54:12.960]  Oh yeah, it's tiny, so you can lose it.
[54:12.960 --> 54:13.800]  Yeah.
[54:13.800 --> 54:14.620]  It's like the size of it.
[54:14.620 --> 54:15.960]  No, it's a little tiny pin.
[54:15.960 --> 54:17.840]  It could be an earring.
[54:17.840 --> 54:20.400]  I could tie pins for men, earrings for women,
[54:20.400 --> 54:22.000]  or men, if you wear a earring.
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.080]  Yeah, like a little, like a jellybean.
[54:24.080 --> 54:26.600]  Yeah, you have such dedicated listeners.
[54:26.600 --> 54:29.400]  I bet you people, after they listen to this, ask for that.
[54:30.920 --> 54:35.240]  So I do, you know, especially after the post-Joanna's,
[54:36.160 --> 54:38.280]  you know, what was the headline?
[54:38.280 --> 54:39.600]  What was the, I always forget.
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.320]  I mean, it was missing letters.
[54:42.600 --> 54:44.320]  Apple still hasn't fixed your MacBook keyboard
[54:44.320 --> 54:45.320]  or something like that.
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.520]  Right, and you know, the online version,
[54:47.520 --> 54:49.580]  you know, not to reiterate the whole thing,
[54:49.580 --> 54:51.120]  but you got the development team
[54:51.120 --> 54:52.560]  at the wallstreetjournal.com
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.380]  to write some JavaScript software
[54:54.380 --> 54:56.260]  so that people could adjust the sliders,
[54:56.260 --> 54:58.960]  and by default, all the Es were missing
[54:58.960 --> 55:00.640]  and half the Ss or something,
[55:00.640 --> 55:02.720]  and then you could, if you really couldn't even read it,
[55:02.720 --> 55:04.200]  you could adjust it with sliders
[55:04.200 --> 55:06.960]  and get the missing letters back in.
[55:07.880 --> 55:08.720]  Yeah.
[55:08.720 --> 55:09.920]  It wasn't a bad key.
[55:09.920 --> 55:11.560]  It wasn't a bad MacBook Air.
[55:11.560 --> 55:13.120]  And once they went retina,
[55:13.120 --> 55:14.700]  and yeah, it was a little too expensive,
[55:14.700 --> 55:16.240]  and yeah, the keyboard wasn't great
[55:16.240 --> 55:17.640]  even with the third generation thing,
[55:17.640 --> 55:18.480]  but it was all right.
[55:18.480 --> 55:19.320]  And you could say, well,
[55:19.320 --> 55:20.600]  if you really need a new MacBook Air,
[55:20.600 --> 55:21.760]  you can get this one.
[55:21.760 --> 55:23.920]  You know, it wasn't like you could,
[55:23.920 --> 55:26.200]  you would un-recommend it,
[55:26.200 --> 55:28.280]  but now it just feels like,
[55:28.280 --> 55:30.720]  boy, you can really recommend this to everybody
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.560]  because they've gotten back down
[55:32.560 --> 55:34.300]  to the 9.99 starting price,
[55:34.300 --> 55:35.440]  and it's a good config.
[55:35.440 --> 55:40.440]  The 9.99 MacBook Air is a pretty good laptop
[55:41.260 --> 55:42.480]  for an awful lot of people.
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.300]  There's, you know.
[55:43.300 --> 55:47.320]  And for 2.56 starting now on storage, it's great.
[55:47.320 --> 55:48.320]  It's a great deal.
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.080]  It is, it really is.
[55:50.080 --> 55:53.960]  And you know, I wonder what some of the motivation was
[55:53.960 --> 55:55.560]  for Apple to drop the price back
[55:55.560 --> 55:57.020]  and to drop that storage back.
[55:57.020 --> 55:59.140]  Was it, you know, a little bit of,
[55:59.140 --> 56:01.080]  well, we know this is the thing that sells the most
[56:01.080 --> 56:02.360]  and we want to juice that
[56:02.360 --> 56:03.800]  and we want to get more people,
[56:03.800 --> 56:04.920]  these in the hands of more people.
[56:04.920 --> 56:06.740]  They even did that education deal, right?
[56:06.740 --> 56:09.440]  It's 8.99 for education.
[56:10.440 --> 56:12.880]  Was it also like, eh, we know this last one,
[56:12.880 --> 56:13.720]  we kind of messed up,
[56:13.720 --> 56:15.160]  so maybe we make it,
[56:15.160 --> 56:17.520]  this is my just thought is a little bit like
[56:17.520 --> 56:19.160]  if someone's going to buy a new computer
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.280]  because they hate that keyboard,
[56:20.280 --> 56:22.700]  well, maybe it's a little bit easier for them to buy this
[56:22.700 --> 56:23.960]  if we drop this price a little bit.
[56:23.960 --> 56:25.800]  I highly doubt that was any motivation,
[56:25.800 --> 56:27.560]  but I, in my mind,
[56:27.560 --> 56:30.540]  like to think they were thinking that or something.
[56:30.540 --> 56:32.480]  Yeah, and you know, and with the keyboard,
[56:32.480 --> 56:35.220]  it seems anecdotally that once they got
[56:35.220 --> 56:39.640]  to that final generation of the butterfly switch keyboard,
[56:39.640 --> 56:43.240]  they did fix the reliability issues,
[56:43.240 --> 56:45.240]  or at least for the, you know,
[56:45.240 --> 56:47.560]  to the point where it really does seem,
[56:47.560 --> 56:50.960]  looking at my email from people who read the site,
[56:50.960 --> 56:53.160]  and you know, I'm sure you did too
[56:53.160 --> 56:55.040]  after you emphasized it so many times,
[56:55.040 --> 56:56.520]  you got a lot of readers.
[56:56.520 --> 56:57.760]  So much, so much.
[56:57.760 --> 57:00.380]  It really does seem like the final generation
[57:00.380 --> 57:01.600]  of the butterfly switch thing
[57:01.600 --> 57:04.920]  was as good as that fundamental design was going to get,
[57:04.920 --> 57:06.920]  and they fixed, and you know,
[57:06.920 --> 57:10.900]  the reliability issues were above and beyond anything else,
[57:10.900 --> 57:12.920]  because you, if you,
[57:12.920 --> 57:14.360]  it just seems mind-boggling
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.880]  that you couldn't rely on your keyboard on these devices.
[57:17.880 --> 57:19.560]  They fixed that, but it's still,
[57:19.560 --> 57:21.200]  it just didn't feel great.
[57:21.200 --> 57:22.680]  It didn't sound good.
[57:22.680 --> 57:24.080]  You, and you've written about the sound.
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.360]  Ever since they first came out,
[57:25.360 --> 57:28.280]  like with the 12-inch MacBook that didn't-
[57:28.280 --> 57:29.260]  I hate the sound.
[57:29.260 --> 57:31.440]  It just, it, hmm.
[57:31.440 --> 57:32.600]  And they fixed that here too.
[57:32.600 --> 57:34.320]  I mean, they really did.
[57:34.320 --> 57:36.480]  In, when the 16-inch came out,
[57:36.480 --> 57:38.580]  I did a sound comparison,
[57:38.580 --> 57:40.460]  and comparing sounds of keyboards,
[57:40.460 --> 57:42.400]  and I mean, this is so much quieter,
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.920]  and it's so much more satisfying to listen to.
[57:46.160 --> 57:47.000]  Yeah.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.520]  Yeah, I mean, it will be,
[57:51.200 --> 57:52.280]  it will be interesting, I think,
[57:52.280 --> 57:54.540]  to see where they go from here,
[57:54.540 --> 57:56.960]  because I've always had this obsession with the Air.
[57:56.960 --> 58:00.880]  It was, I was, it sort of was the highlight of my career
[58:00.880 --> 58:02.680]  at The Verge, where I would tell people, you know,
[58:02.680 --> 58:04.580]  this is the best Windows computer,
[58:04.580 --> 58:08.000]  and I sort of became known in a meme way for saying,
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.680]  you know, for, well, for $200 more,
[58:09.680 --> 58:10.880]  you can always get the MacBook Air.
[58:10.880 --> 58:12.600]  And honestly, if you ask me to this date,
[58:12.600 --> 58:14.480]  what I think is the best Apple gadget,
[58:14.480 --> 58:16.480]  I will say the MacBook Air, because it,
[58:17.360 --> 58:20.160]  I just don't think there was ever a laptop at a time,
[58:20.160 --> 58:22.360]  you know, especially it was, was it 2000,
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.320]  probably around 2014-ish timeframe,
[58:27.320 --> 58:32.160]  that there was just no better mix of portability,
[58:32.160 --> 58:35.440]  and performance, and endurance than the MacBook Air.
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.920]  And it sort of was like this thing you hold up,
[58:36.920 --> 58:40.080]  and you're like, this is the best computer there is.
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.880]  It's probably not gonna get much better.
[58:42.880 --> 58:44.920]  Or I at least had said that for many years.
[58:44.920 --> 58:46.760]  And so now we're at this point where I keep thinking about
[58:46.760 --> 58:47.600]  like, what's next?
[58:47.600 --> 58:50.000]  I've always thought about like, what's next for the Air?
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.080]  And I thought it was really interesting
[58:53.080 --> 58:56.520]  that they announced the Air and the Pro the same day,
[58:56.520 --> 58:59.880]  and the Pro with the keyboard, with the Magic Keyboard.
[58:59.880 --> 59:02.480]  And for me, it kind of, I was gonna do my review,
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.800]  sort of comparing the two and thinking about like,
[59:04.800 --> 59:06.280]  well, what do you buy, which one?
[59:06.280 --> 59:07.600]  And it really mostly just came down to,
[59:07.600 --> 59:09.240]  I was like, you know, people still wanna buy an Air,
[59:09.240 --> 59:10.280]  they wanna buy an Air.
[59:10.280 --> 59:12.360]  If people wanna buy an iPad,
[59:12.360 --> 59:14.520]  they're probably looking at the Pro.
[59:14.520 --> 59:16.520]  But I do really put the two side by side
[59:16.520 --> 59:17.840]  and wonder to myself,
[59:17.840 --> 59:21.000]  these two have to converge at some point.
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  Because it just, there's so many overlapping
[59:27.360 --> 59:29.400]  use cases for them.
[59:29.400 --> 59:33.680]  It is a very strange strategy.
[59:33.680 --> 59:35.320]  I don't think they have to.
[59:35.320 --> 59:37.920]  Like, I feel like at the highest level,
[59:37.920 --> 59:39.680]  it feels like they have to converge
[59:39.680 --> 59:41.000]  because they're so similar.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.520]  And they even, like you said, they even,
[59:43.520 --> 59:45.760]  you know, in just two products
[59:45.760 --> 59:47.360]  that they announced at the same time,
[59:47.360 --> 59:49.560]  and they're both, you know,
[59:49.560 --> 59:53.280]  if you look at the 12.9 inch iPad Pro,
[59:53.280 --> 59:55.000]  it's effectively a 13 inch screen.
[59:55.000 --> 59:56.520]  I mean, it's 12.9 inches.
[59:56.520 --> 59:59.200]  It's a 10th of an inch difference diagonally.
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.200]  And they've, the big selling point
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.560]  for the iPad announcement was this Magic Keyboard accessory
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.400]  that turns it, you know,
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.840]  we don't have it in our hands yet,
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.720]  but it's the one thing,
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.040]  it's what made writing the iPad review so hard
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.200]  is that the one thing everybody wanted to hear about
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.880]  and the thing I most wanted to play with
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.800]  is the thing that's not coming out until quote unquote May.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.600]  And-
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.640]  And that's actually why I didn't write the review
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.600]  or do the comparison right now.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.760]  And it turns the iPad into a laptop.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.560]  I mean, they, you know, and they keep saying
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.160]  they can, you know, that it's a touch first platform
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.400]  and it doesn't take away from touch at all,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.120]  but it's a laptop, right?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.200]  It is a, and they even mentioned that it is,
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.280]  in plain English,
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.840]  the magnetic attachment is secure enough
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.880]  and the way that it's weighted is secure enough
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.280]  that they emphasized when we talked to them
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.200]  that you can use it on your lap.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.560]  You can sit, you know, on a train
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.320]  when wherever we're allowed to ride on trains again
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.760]  and put it on your lap.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.400]  And you could, you know, they released commercials
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.080]  and they showed people, you know, sitting in a park
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.760]  and just sitting on the, you know,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.480]  like sitting on the grass with the,
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.120]  or on their bed or something like that
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.360]  with it in laptop configuration on their lap.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.760]  And so you think, well,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.320]  how can you have two different platforms
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.080]  that are the same fundamental form factor?
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.200]  But then when you really look at the details, I don't know,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.600]  I don't see the convergence.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.720]  I really don't.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.120]  I don't see the Mac platform converging
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.240]  with iPad OS in any way.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.360]  Yeah, and I think like I've thought about my use cases
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.640]  and I use such specialized apps for certain things
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.400]  where I say, okay, that I couldn't go to the iPad
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.800]  and if I just needed to do lighter work,
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.320]  I could use the Air
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.840]  and then maybe I could have a desktop at home or something.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.920]  You know, I have odd computing needs, obviously.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.040]  But for most people using the Air
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040]  and the people we recommend the Air to,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.440]  what do they do with it?
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.600]  Email, web, social media, right?
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.960]  And why then, why not the iPad for those things?
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.800]  I don't know.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.240]  You know, it is a very strange situation to be in
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.240]  and it, I don't know if I've,
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240]  if I accept it through cognitive dissonance or what.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.680]  Like I'm willing to accept it
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.560]  because I don't think either one,
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.960]  either platform should get a whole lot more like the other.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.160]  Like I know I've been more critical this year
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.120]  in my writing about iPad OS
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:00.560]  and the multitasking interface in particular.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.880]  And the knee-jerk response to that
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.520]  from people who really love multitasking on the iPad
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.760]  and have, you know, put their professional life
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.240]  much more or entirely on in some cases, and I believe you.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.280]  I believe these people who spend, you know,
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.840]  use their iPad as their main work computer.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.960]  And the knee-jerk response to my criticism
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.520]  is to assume that what I'm saying
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.000]  is that I want the iPad OS to get more like Mac OS
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.680]  and do things the Mac OS way at the interface level.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.680]  And that's, I don't think I ever wrote that.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.640]  If I did, I didn't mean to, that was bad writing.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.280]  And it's not what I mean.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.680]  But I do think that the iPad OS, for me at least,
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.160]  has to be able to do things,
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  doesn't have to do it the way the Mac does it,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.080]  but I wanna be able to do it the same way.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:54.960]  You wanna get it done.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.720]  Right, and I don't wanna get confused about things
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.680]  that I find confusing on iPad OS multitasking.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.120]  It doesn't have to be done, and I think it would be wrong.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.560]  I will go so far as to say it would be wrong
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.040]  to copy the Mac way of doing things.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.960]  What I would like is for Apple to come up with a way
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.400]  that's better than the Mac way of doing it.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.320]  Like, wouldn't that be so terribly exciting
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.200]  if there was a way, a multitasking interface
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.640]  that was better than the Mac way of doing things
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.960]  and arranging things?
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.840]  And conversely, I certainly don't think,
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.760]  I feel even stronger the other way,
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.000]  that I don't think that Mac OS should get more like iPad OS
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.960]  in terms of the way, I mean,
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.520]  it just doesn't even make any sense to me
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.320]  that you would want to get rid of Windows
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.040]  overlapping Windows that you can resize
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.520]  to any degree on the Mac.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.840]  So I just don't see how they converge further,
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.680]  and I know that some people are going to want
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.880]  to immediately say, well, what about Catalyst?
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.640]  Catalyst, the whole point is convergence,
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.840]  where you can take your iPad apps
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.480]  and use the Catalyst frameworks
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.160]  in the latest version of Mac OS,
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.120]  and now you can have one app that is adjusted,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.680]  the developers can do work,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.760]  and now you've got this app that is the iPad app,
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.080]  and now it's a Mac app at the same time,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.240]  but that's still, it's not really convergence,
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.520]  and the Catalyst apps that do it the best
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.680]  are the most different between the iPad
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.600]  and the Mac versions,
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.040]  and the developers have to do the most work,
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.680]  and if it's working out well,
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.760]  ideally it's still a lot less work
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.280]  and a lot more familiar to the developer
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.640]  than doing a wholly separate Mac app and iPad app,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.640]  but it still is not just click a checkbox
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.040]  in Xcode and out comes a Mac app,
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.960]  and it looks and works in the way Mac users
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.640]  expect a Mac app to work.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.120]  Yeah, I mean, maybe converge is the wrong word,
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.080]  maybe replace.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.120]  Right, right, and that more and more people,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.960]  if they're looking to spend somewhere
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.600]  between $1,000 and $1,200 on an Apple device
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.520]  that you can use as a laptop.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.160]  Then they buy an iPad Pro.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.080]  Right, and get the Magic Keyboard for when they do it,
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.080]  and it is, if you're going to have just one $1,100,
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.440]  let's just say $1,100 or, I guess, no, I guess, yeah.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.360]  Yeah.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.600]  Well, it's somewhere in that range.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.480]  If you get the Pro, the 12.9 with the Magic Keyboard,
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.720]  I think you're at 14.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.520]  Yeah, and if you get the 11, it's smaller.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.360]  But that's gonna drop.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.920]  That will drop over time.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.760]  Yeah, hopefully, I would think so.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.440]  Certainly the iPad portion should drop over time,
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.680]  but it's certainly a more flexible device
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.680]  because you can do things with it.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.760]  The two-in-one form factor where you can use it as a laptop
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.520]  when you're doing laptop-y things
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.680]  and you want to have a trackpad
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.600]  for things that are great with a trackpad.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.280]  And then you don't have to really disconnect cables
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.120]  or anything, you just unmagnetically snap it from the thing,
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.920]  and now you've got an e-book reader,
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.320]  and you can just sit there on your couch and lean back,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.160]  and you don't have to worry about the keyboard,
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.320]  and just sit there and flip through a book or web pages
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.560]  or whatever you do,
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.480]  which is the thing most people have done with an iPad
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.560]  for most of the time.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.440]  Yeah, it's like the ultimate flexibility,
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.240]  and I think that's, maybe that'll also be
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.920]  the driving force of people who just say,
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920]  you know, I don't need all of that,
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.920]  I just need a plain old laptop,
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920]  and then they'll still get the air,
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.400]  and maybe they just keep them around forever and ever,
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.800]  until, at least until we are out of house arrest.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.800]  Let me take a break on that note

[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.320]  You're gonna need your audio editor
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320]  to edit out my stomach rumbling.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.320]  I legit believe that it's probably being picked up on.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.080]  Are you?
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.720]  My eating schedule's so out of sorts.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.720]  I made matzo pizza with my son at 11 o'clock,
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.480]  and now I'm starving.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.320]  I have, I tend to be a, as a,
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.880]  in addition to my regular night owl sleeping schedule,
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.640]  I tend to eat most of my calories later in the day.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.480]  Same.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.240]  But this whole thing has thrown me off,
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.360]  and I will go, I'll realize, I'm like, wait,
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.360]  have I eaten in like 16 hours?
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.760]  Maybe that's why I'm hungry.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.040]  Right, I mean, that's, I probably,
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.280]  like I didn't eat breakfast.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.080]  I had something to eat at 11, and now I'm like,
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:33.920]  okay, it's time for lunch, or dinner, or linner, whatever.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.320]  We just eat at any time.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.680]  There's no time.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.520]  There's no time.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.400]  And we're certainly not running out of food,
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.840]  is the other thing, which is a great thing,
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.480]  but we just have these constant like Instacart
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.840]  or Fresh Direct deliveries
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.720]  that we're just trying not to lose spots, so.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.120]  Yeah, yeah, same here.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.360]  Have you seen this thing?
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.960]  This is, again, I think most people
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.960]  have elevated their humaneness.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.720]  People are, people have written about it,
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.440]  that people are saying hello to each other more
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.920]  when you're out, or you just, you smile.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.320]  It's like, there's just this collective sense
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.640]  that we're all in it together,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.000]  and people are being nice to each other
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.440]  to the best that we can
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.920]  while maintaining our social distancing.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.480]  And then when you find out that there are people
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.200]  who are taking advantage of the situation,
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.400]  you're like, what the hell is wrong with you?
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.880]  I just read this story last night
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.880]  about people who are offering big Instacart tips.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.080]  Oh yeah, I saw this.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.520]  And then after the stuff gets dropped off at their door,
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.560]  you can apparently, Amy handles the Instacart stuff,
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.480]  but apparently you can like revoke the tip afterwards,
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.920]  and then they just take the whole thing away.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.400]  It's like, you are a garbage person.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.560]  That, I mean, you might as well,
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.400]  that's like walking,
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.360]  you're just stealing money from somebody.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.320]  That's like, if you are, well, remember,
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.640]  do you remember restaurants?
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.480]  I remember that.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.400]  It's like if you like pay your check
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.960]  and you're like, get up from the table
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.280]  and you're walking out and you see that there's another,
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.240]  some other table had left a cash tip
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.840]  and you just pick it off the table
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.440]  as you walk off the, as you leave the restaurant.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.480]  No, unless your Instacart delivery person
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.840]  punched you in the face,
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.480]  came to the door, took out your bottle of seltzer
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.760]  and smacked you in the face with it,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.960]  that's the only reason to revoke your tip right now.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.000]  It is, and I mentioned before,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.200]  like thank God for the internet
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.400]  and how would we be doing this 30 years ago
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.440]  or 25 years ago, or even with the internet,
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.080]  but before some of these surfaces,
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.080]  like Instacart is, and these delivery services
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.160]  are helping us collectively maintain social distancing.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.080]  I really do, I want these people to be paid appropriately.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.880]  I want them to be tipped well.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.720]  And I know that there've been some walkouts and stuff
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.800]  and the labor issues are serious.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.600]  And I really hope they get worked out
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.280]  so that the people who are willing to do this work
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.640]  are getting compensated appropriately.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.200]  But I think like collectively it is good for us
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.160]  that if one person can do the shopping
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.120]  for 10, 15, 20 other people in the course of a day,
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.280]  that's better because there are fewer people
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.480]  out circulating and maintaining the distance.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.720]  I don't know what we would do.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.280]  I mean, I guess we would all be going to the grocery store
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.880]  on a usual schedule and it just seems so contrary
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.880]  to what we're supposed to be doing collectively
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.040]  to help flatten the curve.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.760]  Yeah, we would all be going and they already have
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.960]  certain times for certain types of people,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.360]  for people above a certain age or if you're pregnant.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.040]  I mean, I would assume some of those restrictions
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.380]  would be even worse because this has allowed,
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.200]  I mean, at least in major metropolitan areas like we live,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.960]  it's really allowed people to decrease the amount
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.280]  of traffic or it's allowed these stores
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.520]  to decrease the amount of traffic.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.640]  Yeah, we haven't been, I think, is it a week or two?
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.000]  I'm actually forgetting if it's a full week
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.040]  at this point or two weeks.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.360]  I think it's a full week where nobody here,
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.640]  we haven't done any shopping outside the house.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.800]  Yeah, for me, it's that long too.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.560]  I do go to my local coffee shop still
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.400]  because they have takeout and it's just sort of a window
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.160]  when it's easy to do and I feel like I'm supporting them.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.540]  But I haven't been to, I mean, I went to Target
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.680]  about a week and a half ago, it was my wife's birthday
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.120]  and I wanted to get her some stuff.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.000]  But other than that, no.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.520]  Let me see here, I can look on my Apple Pay,
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.500]  my Apple Wallet and I can see when I actually
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.160]  charged something, 327.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.800]  So March 27th, I went to Trader Joe's.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.280]  So how many, how long ago was March 27th?
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.080]  It feels like a year ago.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.080]  That was at least 13, 14 days ago, right?
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.720]  Yeah, yeah, so it's been like two weeks
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.220]  since I did shopping outside the house.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:22.580]  I got a pizza delivered the other day
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:27.580]  and it felt like I was eating like a Roman emperor.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.280]  It just felt like, oh my God,
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.680]  and it's like the easiest thing in the world.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.080]  Whoever really worries about getting a pizza delivered,
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.240]  but it just felt like, well, here's something
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.240]  I wouldn't really be able to make at home.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.500]  No, no, you can make pizza at home.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.760]  We do make pizza at home sometimes,
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.040]  but it's like a good crust that you get.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.120]  I'm not a expert.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.800]  I have friends who are expert pizza makers at home
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.680]  and they're like Instagramming their pizzas
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.100]  and I'm like, oh, I wish I had gotten on team
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.000]  learn how to make good pizza at home.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.200]  I'm keeping Passover right now,
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.800]  so we're making matzo pizza.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.000]  If you'd like my recipe for that delicious meal,
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.360]  I'm happy to pass it on to you.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.760]  It's basically a cracker with tomato sauce
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.880]  and melted cheese.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.440]  I am not Jewish, but I love matzo bread.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.280]  Loved it.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.000]  One of my best friends in grade school was Jewish
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.320]  and I won't use his name
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.680]  because it would be ratting him out.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.160]  He was not a fan and so I would trade him packed lunch.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.080]  I used to pack a lunch and I would trade him
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.720]  like my regular bread for some of his matzo bread
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.720]  during Passover.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.640]  I love it.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.640]  I just feel like I had you.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.440]  Says every non-Jew and every Jew is like, no.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.640]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.000]  No, again, no, we like it like the first two days.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.100]  Like we're still in like the early section here
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.080]  and I usually keep it.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.080]  I really try to keep this tradition
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.240]  and try to keep the whole eight days with no bread
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.240]  or really anything that has, well, yeah,
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.200]  I won't say I keep it all, but I do a pretty good job.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.080]  Like I won't eat chips and I won't eat like wraps
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.900]  and stuff like that.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.120]  Yeah, it's a lot easier to say as a non-Jew
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.880]  when you're just sneaking, taking it here and there
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.360]  as opposed to maintaining it over the whole length
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.600]  of Passover, but.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.440]  Yeah.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560]  Well, yeah, no, it sounds like we're doing really,
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.200]  we're pretty good citizens keeping our social distancing.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:33.200]  Yeah, it is weird and I know I've gotten feedback
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.520]  from people and people wanna hear more podcasts.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.280]  Some people I've gotten and I don't know how not
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.120]  to talk about it.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.320]  Like there've been a few people and it's one of those things
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.800]  where you can't please everybody.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.240]  I know, I mean, with the readership of your column
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.040]  at the Wall Street Journal, you certainly know it
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.720]  even better than I do.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.480]  And I know that there's at least some people who would like
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.360]  for me to do the podcast without even mentioning it
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.920]  because they kind of wanna get their mind off it,
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.280]  but I don't know how to do that.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.840]  Like it's, I can't not mention it.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.760]  And so I apologize if that's what you would prefer,
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.280]  but I just can't help but talk about the way
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.280]  that technology intersects with this great quarantine.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.400]  Yeah, I mean, everything I've written for the last month
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.800]  or so or more has had to do with it
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.200]  because I was also just been doing a lot on work from home
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.960]  and that stuff has really been so useful to our readers
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.040]  and people who are just honestly not set up
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.720]  with the right tech tools to work from home.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.480]  And I've been doing constant tips for our newsletters
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.920]  and I do a daily tip for our newsletters and our podcasts
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.400]  and people have been loving it.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.760]  But also I'm like at one point I'm like,
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.720]  what, like how much is too much here?
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.840]  And I've been struggling with that.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.400]  And I've struggled with that with the air review,
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.760]  which was how do I, I can't review this in a vacuum.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.120]  I can't just ignore how I used the system
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.080]  and under what conditions.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.340]  And that's how I came to that webcam part of that review.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.080]  And people said, oh, like she just has to whine
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.000]  about more things.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.240]  And I was like, well, no, I'm whining about the thing
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.980]  that I have been using the most now.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.200]  And I really tried to balance that,
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.360]  at least the written review about both of them.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.560]  The video, I obviously focused on the webcam.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.700]  And I did a piece yesterday because over the weekend
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.160]  I woke up on Saturday morning
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.000]  and this was last Friday was Trump and CDC's recommendation
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.400]  that we all wear masks or we start to wear masks.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.680]  And I woke up on Saturday morning
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.320]  from two emails from reporters,
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.160]  couple emails from readers being like,
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.080]  my face ID doesn't work with a mask.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.460]  And I sort of said, okay, well, just do this,
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.880]  enter an alternate appearance.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.060]  And they were like, that doesn't work.
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.600]  And I started playing around with it and I was like,
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.180]  all right, I'm gonna write a little bit about this.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.960]  And is it a first world problem?
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.800]  Absolutely.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.360]  We all can put in our passwords,
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.200]  but it was an interesting story to go down the road
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.720]  of looking at how our faces are being read from,
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.480]  or how our faces are not being able to be read
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.580]  with a mask on and how some people have gotten it.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:04.840]  And I found this woman who has been creating face ID masks,
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.320]  which are completely nuts.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.560]  Oh, really?
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.920]  And I was like, you know what?
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.720]  I'm gonna do this story because it's interesting.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.480]  I'm using it as a point to talk a little bit about face ID.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.720]  And yeah, I struggled.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.360]  I definitely struggle right now with like,
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.720]  what should I cover?
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.660]  How can I be of most help to people?
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.300]  I've also just been writing and doing stuff all the time.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.840]  So I don't really have time to think about it.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.940]  So the face ID versus masks thing
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.120]  is something I mean to write about,
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.440]  I do wanna write about, I'm getting email about.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.600]  And the only reason I haven't written about it
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.720]  is that I'm still thinking it through.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:46.720]  But how does a face ID capable mask work?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.800]  What's the trick?
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.960]  I don't even understand how that would work.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.280]  So I've done, this has been my last week of like,
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.000]  not week, I just kind of crammed out
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.280]  a lot of the reporting over the weekend
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.040]  because I became so interested in it.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.800]  But basically, no, you cannot register your face
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.600]  as an alternate appearance in face ID with a mask.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.440]  It just says obstructed, right?
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.200]  It says like, face obstructed, can't register.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.240]  Long story as you read in the piece,
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.200]  some researchers in, they're in Hong Kong, I believe,
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.620]  or maybe they're mainland China,
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.920]  they figured out if you fold the mask in half,
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.840]  you can register your face.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.320]  And then you put the mask on and it could work.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.760]  That did not work for me.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.840]  It works like with very success, honestly.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.160]  Then I found this woman who decided,
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.280]  she had heard about this issue a couple months ago,
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.320]  and she said, oh, I'm gonna just print my face on a mask,
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.200]  and then it'll work.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.180]  Then she realized, no, that won't work
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.140]  because face ID and the whole TrueDepth system
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.120]  is looking for a 3D,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.000]  I mean, really, it's looking for your face,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.400]  it's looking for-
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.600]  It's the same technology that's there to defeat
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.320]  me holding up a photo of Joanna Stern
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.320]  in front of my iPhone face ID
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.960]  to log in as you.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.400]  And that's exactly what I wrote in the piece,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.920]  which is like, there's a lot of irony here,
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.040]  which is that face ID was actually engineered.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.760]  I did that piece back when the 10 came out
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.280]  when I tried to get my face recreated in masks,
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280]  and it didn't work.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.060]  It's like the opposite here.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.620]  And so, yeah, then she figured out
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:30.320]  that if she made a clay mold of a mouth and nose,
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.040]  and then she went through this elaborate process,
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.680]  you can watch it in the video,
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.480]  and she made a mask with a nose and mouth,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.080]  and she then goes and registers that mask
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.360]  as an alternate appearance.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.860]  With that, it works.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.120]  Huh.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.680]  I did not read that.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.520]  I will have to look for it.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.020]  I mean, this woman's awesome.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.240]  Her name is Danielle Baskin.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.320]  She's been doing, I don't know if you've heard
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.980]  of this other thing called quarantine chat,
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.960]  where you can call a random person and talk.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.160]  She's a product designer and sort of an artist
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.040]  in San Francisco, and so she came up with this,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.960]  and she doesn't really plan to sell them right now.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.400]  She also makes a really good point.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.420]  She's like, if I can get mask materials,
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.120]  I'm gonna make them for people that need it right now.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.280]  But yeah, this works.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.960]  I have to admit, I really feel like this whole thing is,
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.280]  it's an exercise in empathy and examining your own biases.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.280]  I've been aware ever since Face ID first became
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.460]  the replacement for Touch ID with the iPhone X,
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.620]  now what, two and a half years ago,
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:44.580]  that I'm certainly aware enough that in a lot
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:49.100]  of Asian countries, face mask wearing
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.220]  in cold and flu season is common.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:56.820]  It's common as an allergen type thing.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.420]  It's considered polite if you yourself feel
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.620]  like you have a cold or something but not sick enough
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.260]  that you wanna stay home, that you wear a mask
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:10.740]  as a courtesy to others around you to lower the spreading.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.680]  I'm aware of that, and I certainly,
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.420]  I heard right from the get-go that,
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.500]  hey, Face ID doesn't really work when you're wearing a mask,
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.540]  and people over here wear masks all the time.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.540]  And it wasn't that I dismissed it completely,
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:33.820]  but I dismissed it as a concern to some degree
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.740]  out of my own cultural bias, where I sort of,
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.180]  I don't mean to sound dismissive,
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:46.180]  but I'd sort of written off the whole Asian face mask
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:49.560]  culture thing as a bit of low-grade hypochondria.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.560]  And it's just self-examining my own cultural bias.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.960]  It's like, hmm, now that I really think about it,
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.780]  we're the ones who were wrong, clearly.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:07.780]  And as this particular COVID-19 epidemic engulfed the world,
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:14.460]  they must have been looking at how long it took us
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.380]  in the U.S., in North America,
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:22.380]  and in other European countries to start wearing masks
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:26.580]  as though we were insane, because they could tell
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.660]  that surely wearing a mask as you're out and about,
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.780]  however effective it is, it has to be at least
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.700]  more effective than not wearing a mask at all.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.900]  Even if it's 1% improvement,
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:43.540]  it has to be some level of an improvement.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:47.820]  And everything that I've read about it
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:50.260]  certainly suggests it's more effective than that.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.340]  We must've looked crazy going until the end of March
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.620]  without doing it.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:57.220]  And now all of a sudden you look at Face ID and you think,
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.700]  hmm, this is a problem.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.360]  And surely Apple must be considering this as well,
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.640]  and as well as, I haven't actually tried it on my Pixel 4,
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.420]  but the Pixel 4 has, all sorts of other Android phones have-
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.780]  I tried it on the Samsung, I don't have the Pixel with me,
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:15.720]  and I did not wanna make a trip to the office for it
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.500]  for this piece, so I had a Samsung here,
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.540]  and I had the same problem,
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.140]  but it also wouldn't register with the mask on.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:26.180]  Yeah, it doesn't work as a second face,
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.300]  because it needs more of your face
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.220]  to get whatever it's doing for the ID.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.940]  And I will admit too, it's not just Asian culture
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.640]  versus American culture.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.640]  I also got some very, at least, it was a whole email thread,
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.860]  but from a daring Fireball reader
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.780]  who's a surgeon here in America.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.540]  This is in my piece, yeah, go on, but yeah.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.540]  Well, and he wrote about it, and he is an enthusiastic,
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.020]  obviously he's a daring Fireball reader, he's into it,
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.100]  and wrote me this whole thing about all the effort
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.780]  he tried to get through to get his Face ID-powered
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.740]  enabled phone to work with a surgical mask
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.260]  and never really got a good, it was like,
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.660]  ultimately came to the conclusion
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.140]  that there's no good way to get this to work.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.900]  No, I had the same exact experience,
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.100]  so when I started doing some reporting on it,
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.100]  that's what I started realizing,
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.020]  and then I looked through my emails,
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.960]  I was like, oh, this guy's a doctor.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.900]  And in the piece, in the written piece,
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.460]  I mean, it kinda goes all over the place
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.420]  because there was a lot to cover,
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.220]  and there's only so many words I can convince my editors
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.640]  about Face ID and face masks right now.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.460]  But they've been dealing with this
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:35.500]  in the medical community for years,
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.260]  and one of the doctors I interviewed said,
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.640]  right now, more than ever,
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.460]  it's actually a very big problem,
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.740]  and he walked me through why.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:47.020]  It was because if he's in the operating room,
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:49.340]  and right now there's limited PPE,
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.740]  there's really limited supplies for them,
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:52.900]  he's in the operating room,
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.340]  and this is something I realized too,
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.540]  a couple of weeks ago, my mom was in the hospital,
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.480]  the entire, all of these hospitals
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.900]  run on phones at this point.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.340]  It was nuts to me, it was completely surprising to me
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.260]  when I was with my mom there a couple of weeks ago.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.860]  And he says there's no pager system,
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.060]  there's no other way for another doctor in the hospital
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:12.900]  to get in touch with me.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.860]  They have to text, at this one,
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.540]  he specifically said we use iPhones.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.140]  So if he's in the operating room,
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.860]  or he's going into the cath lab or something,
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:25.500]  he has to, he can't pull down his mask,
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.300]  because right now that means he'd have to replace the mask
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.940]  or make himself susceptible to other things in the room.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.540]  And so he doesn't wanna pull down the mask,
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.240]  and he will also have gloves on
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.820]  and doesn't wanna contaminate the gloves.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:39.660]  So he often will ask the nurse or somebody else in the room,
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.360]  they will tell them his password.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:45.020]  And then they have the password, they put it in,
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.380]  and then he says he often changes his password.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.100]  I heard this from other people right now
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.100]  in the medical community too, because again,
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.040]  they don't wanna be taking on and off the masks,
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.380]  and they don't wanna be touching
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.380]  and contaminating more gloves and replacing the gloves.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.620]  And again, outside the professional sphere,
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:07.120]  there are more people now wearing gloves
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.540]  as part of their personal protection going out.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.540]  I don't think it's as effective,
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.120]  and I actually think that because of,
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.380]  if you frequently wash your hands,
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:19.300]  you might be better off just using your bare hands
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.700]  and washing and using hand sanitizer very frequently.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.780]  But if you wanna wear gloves, you wear gloves,
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:26.940]  but if you're wearing gloves and a mask,
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.460]  you're no good with any of these
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.940]  biometric authentication things.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.700]  Yeah, no, in my piece, as you'll see,
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.620]  I did, the gloves work fine for putting your password in.
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.560]  If you have rubber gloves,
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.220]  it works completely fine on the touchscreen.
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.740]  Right, but it wouldn't work for Touch ID.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:43.180]  You're down to using the passcode.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.100]  You're back to the passcode.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.900]  Right, and it's funny because for,
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:50.660]  until, I'm gonna guess about six months ago,
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:55.660]  I just had a six-digit numeric PIN number for my phone.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:30:00.660]  And at some point in one of these law enforcement
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:04.700]  hacking into iPhone, like, oh,
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.460]  and then there's this Israeli company that makes a device,
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.900]  then they can go through, remember that?
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.380]  And people were doing the math,
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:15.820]  and they can't go through as many numbers as you think
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:20.820]  because the security chip in the iPhone
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:26.300]  that protects it only allows, at a technical level,
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.860]  only allows, like, 12 attempts per second.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.940]  I think that's what it is.
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:35.220]  12, which sounds like a lot,
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.380]  but when you really wanna go through, you know,
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.740]  the total number of six-digit passcodes possible,
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:47.580]  12 per second isn't that great, but if you increase
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.580]  to an alphanumeric one, you don't need
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:55.300]  to have a crazy long password.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:58.980]  Like, the way that you, the basic advice for how
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.820]  you're signing up for a new web experience
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.820]  and you wanna create a strong password
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:08.540]  and it's 27 characters long, uppercase and lowercase
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.260]  and punctuation and numbers, you don't need that
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.700]  with a phone to be very, very secure.
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:18.700]  Like, a six or seven character password that uses just,
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.700]  you know, could just be, like, all lowercase
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:26.580]  and a punctuation character, just that number
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:30.940]  of characters puts you into, like, 27 years on average
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.340]  to crack your phone or something like that or even longer.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.180]  So you don't need it.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.020]  So you changed it?
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.680]  I changed it to a, you know, pretty simple,
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.680]  not too hard to type in passcode on my phone.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.780]  You know, I don't wanna reveal too much.
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.720]  Tell me, tell me what it is.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.740]  Nobody will know.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.020]  But it's not too hard.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.420]  It doesn't involve shifting to the various keyboards
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:56.540]  on the phone very much, you know, and it, and, and.
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.220]  I'm looking to do that right now, honestly.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:31:59.060]  I'm looking at the settings.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.220]  And ever since, ever since I did it,
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.660]  I realized how few times I actually need
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.320]  to put the code in my phone.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.300]  But now that when I do go out, I'm wearing a mask
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.300]  and, you know, and, and as this eases up,
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:16.140]  hopefully in the weeks to come, and I do go out more,
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.980]  but will be wearing a face mask,
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.100]  I guess I'm gonna go back to a numeric passcode
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.780]  because I'm gonna have to enter it
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:26.420]  because you can't, you know, just fundamental basic,
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.960]  all right, if you're gonna get on the team face mask
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.780]  and wear a face mask when you go out,
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.320]  you can't just lower it every time
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.060]  you wanna get on your phone.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.180]  So that's exactly what I wrote in the piece.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.940]  I was like, that's a very bad idea
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.660]  because then you're just gonna be touching your face
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.620]  and that, like, you wouldn't normally be touching your face
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.820]  that way anyway, so don't do that.
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:44.660]  Right, and so.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.460]  You know, just, and to be clear in the piece,
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.340]  you should wear a mask.
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:50.920]  Like if you, being, wearing a mask right now
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.380]  is one of the nicest things you can do,
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.620]  as you were saying before, right?
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.020]  Like you're not only protecting yourself,
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.740]  you're protecting other people, so.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.740]  And you're removing the stigma.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:03.280]  So the previous advice here in the U.S. was
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.620]  you should only wear a mask
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:07.180]  if you feel like you might have symptoms
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.780]  or if you know that you have the cold or flu
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:12.820]  or if you know, you know, you think you have the COVID-19
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.900]  but you have to go out anyway because, you know, whatever.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.780]  You live alone and nobody else can help you
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.780]  get your prescription or your groceries or whatever.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.500]  Wear a mask if you feel like you have anything.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.980]  Well, that stigmatizes the people
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.820]  because then all of a sudden,
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.460]  if the only people wearing masks are people who are sick,
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:32.320]  then everybody looks, and I, you know, I admit,
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.020]  I think I even mentioned this on my show like five weeks ago
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.700]  that I was out in the early days of this, you know,
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.240]  before we were quarantined,
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.020]  I was talking to Federico Vitici, who lives in Italy,
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.780]  and Italy was hit hard, you know,
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.440]  but before it really erupted there.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.540]  It was just, you know, in the early stages of,
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.380]  hey, Italy might have a problem.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:56.300]  I mentioned that I was out and I saw two people
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.120]  wearing masks here in Philly,
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.920]  and I thought it was like a little freaked out.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.460]  Not like I like walked to the other side of the street,
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.800]  but I just thought, it was like one of the first things
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.700]  I had noticed where I was like,
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.620]  hey, things are starting to get weird.
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.920]  But then I thought to myself, oh, are they sick?
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.620]  Do they feel sick?
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:16.340]  It is a stigma, and if everybody, when you go out,
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.660]  you wear a mask, removes the stigma,
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.860]  everybody feels comfortable around other people in masks.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.060]  I mean, it's gonna take us collectively
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:24.900]  some getting used to,
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:28.500]  but I feel like it's happening quickly.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.500]  Yeah, it's funny, I mean, this is not technology related,
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.580]  but it is that stigma, and it's definitely
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:34.560]  this cultural shift.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.540]  I feel it, like when I go get this coffee,
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.020]  I don't do it every day, but every couple of days
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.200]  when I go get my coffee, I wear my mask now, my gloves,
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.160]  and that's when I sort of started noticing
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.300]  the face ID thing as well.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.960]  And you know, it's frustrating, but whatever.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.020]  You sort of feel like if you're wearing a mask,
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.400]  but somebody else is in, you can feel a little bit weird,
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.540]  like, oh, I think you might be sick,
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:57.400]  and like, I need to protect myself from you.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.740]  And that's sort of how I felt
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.020]  when I've been around other people
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:00.980]  that are not wearing masks.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.040]  Like, oh, and then you sort of even raise it,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.740]  or you're like, you're gonna be offended
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.980]  that I put on my mask and you don't have one,
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.180]  but the more people that wear it,
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:11.240]  the less will feel that way.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.500]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.920]  Yeah, we won't feel like, oh, you might be sick,
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.220]  or I'm scared that you're sick.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.820]  I mean, it's this whole new weird thing.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.740]  In fact, like right before we had left the office,
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.860]  people were sort of starting to say,
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.960]  well, he knows somebody who had it,
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.600]  and maybe we shouldn't go near them,
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.120]  and it was this weird thing.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.380]  And socially, it can create this weird thing now
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.620]  where you're like, oh, that person,
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.140]  it's like cooties, like, oh, that person,
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:38.260]  maybe don't go near them.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.780]  And with the mask, it feels like, okay,
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.620]  we have some semblance of like,
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.060]  I respect that I'm preventing you
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.660]  from getting sick from wearing this.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.900]  I mean, to prevent is probably not the right word,
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.580]  because again, some of these are not full-on,
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.340]  what are they, surgical masks, or they're not N95 masks,
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:59.220]  so they can't fully prevent.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.780]  But it gives that, I don't know,
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:04.980]  like that just camaraderie, I feel like.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:07.700]  Yeah, a little bit of this, a little bit of that,
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.580]  a little bit of the other thing, and it all adds up.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.780]  That's, and like so many other things in life,
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:17.100]  that's, it's a good strategy, and it's not like,
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:22.100]  oh, you're supposed to have one single thing
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:27.100]  that is going to keep you from spreading it.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.420]  It's everything taken together.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:31.140]  Stay inside as much as you can.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.620]  When you do go out, maintain distance,
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.820]  wear a mask, wash your hands all the time,
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.260]  use hand sanitizer in addition to washing your hands.
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:44.100]  Watch these videos and learn how poorly
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.660]  you've been washing your hands your entire life.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.620]  And it all adds up, and none of it is 100%,
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:52.940]  and if you're looking for 100%,
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.420]  you're not paying attention to the way
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.900]  it's supposed to work.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.660]  Yeah, so yeah.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.500]  The other thing, too, is I think it's a good point, too,
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:06.940]  where regardless of how effective your mask itself is,
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.580]  whether, and again, let's assume most of us
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.540]  don't have the N95 ones, because the N95 ones are,
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.820]  hopefully, they're all going to the medical professionals
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.200]  who desperately need them.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.200]  But regardless of the efficacy of the mask you have,
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.560]  whether it's homemade or if you've got some paper masks
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.680]  from a drug store, it is.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.000]  It is, as somebody who has gone out
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.320]  for just constitutional walks while wearing one now,
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.000]  it is a constant reminder that you've got one on.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.560]  It definitely makes me touch my face less,
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.920]  because I realize, oh, I've got a mask.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.720]  I'm not supposed to touch my face.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.900]  Don't do it.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.000]  It's hot, you know?
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.480]  I mean, one of my things that I didn't really-
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.320]  Summer's gonna be, summer's gonna be real fun.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.000]  I put a tin of Altoids by our stash of paper masks,
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.280]  because I realized after the first time I wore one,
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.200]  I was like, oh, you wanna pop a mint in
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.760]  before you put your mask on.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.920]  I've had the same thing in the lead of my article.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.600]  I'm like, we have to get used to living in our bad breath.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.760]  Like, we just have to.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.720]  Maybe two, take two mints, really.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.300]  See, that's a solution.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.880]  And there are obviously solutions
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.240]  around getting around the Face ID thing.
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.260]  I mean, as I said in the piece,
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:29.340]  it's like, this is a very minor inconvenience.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.740]  But I do think it's interesting.
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.520]  Well, so I've rethought this.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.840]  So there've been rumors,
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.560]  and I know there are Android phones
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.720]  that take a dual biometric strategy
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.520]  where they have a fingerprint sensor
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.420]  and some kind of facial recognition thing.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.240]  And I had, until now, been sort of on the side,
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.160]  and there are rumors of Apple putting Touch ID
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:00.160]  into the actual displays in addition to Face ID, maybe.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:06.280]  And I had been thinking in terms of just simplicity,
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.760]  it makes sense for there to be one thing,
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.160]  and that it made sense that Apple switched
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.880]  from Touch ID to Face ID with the iPhone X
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.880]  and the success in iPhone XS and iPhone XR
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.540]  and the iPhone 11 models since then.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.440]  Because then there's only one thing to set up
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.400]  when you're, all right, I have a new phone.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.360]  What do I have to do?
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.200]  You log into your iCloud,
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.480]  and you give it permission for this,
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.600]  and then you set up your Face ID.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.320]  Or if it's a different, if it's a phone with the button,
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.240]  and you do your Touch ID,
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.640]  and now you've got your Touch ID,
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.520]  and then you're using your phone.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.680]  And it would be kind of, it's an extra step
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:53.160]  if there were both Touch ID and Face ID,
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.660]  and now you've gotta do two things.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:57.280]  And then which one do you use when you're like,
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.160]  oh, I wanna purchase the thing.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.720]  Which one am I using?
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.720]  I don't know, you have to make a decision or something.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.480]  Now that I'm going through this, I see it.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.360]  My eyes are open to the fact that more methods
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.820]  of biometric authentication are better.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.160]  It would be better, it would be better to have both.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.700]  Although in this case, if you're wearing your gloves
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.000]  and your mask, that neither will help.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.520]  But yes, I agree.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.800]  And obviously there's these rumors
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.320]  that they're gonna come out with this new smaller iPhone
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.480]  and next, who knows now at this point, but soon.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.040]  And that has been apparently for the people
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.520]  who have been against Face ID,
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.440]  who've really still embraced the fingerprint sensor.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.440]  So there's clearly an audience
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.200]  that really does still want that.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.320]  I always hear from them around iPhone review time last year.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.520]  I heard from so many people, it was, yes,
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.680]  the size was a thing, but so many people with the Touch ID
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.680]  preferring that, feeling more secure,
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:59.920]  just don't wanna look at the phone, don't...
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.760]  Many who don't also seem to understand the security of it,
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.620]  I definitely hear from a fair share of people
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.120]  who just don't seem to get it.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.360]  But yeah, there's this huge audience
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.760]  that still wants to use their fingerprint.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.200]  All right, hold that thought, we'll come back to it.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.040]  Let me thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.760]  our very dear friends at Squarespace,
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.720]  longtime sponsors of the show.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.880]  I'll bet if you're a regular listener of the show,
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.600]  you've heard me talk about Squarespace before,
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.000]  but let me tell you about them again.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  They have the all-in-one web publishing platform
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.060]  that they have everything you need to get a website
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:37.480]  off the ground, from domain name registration
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.240]  to a whole slew of professionally designed templates
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.360]  to start with that look great, that scale great
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.900]  from phones to giant desktop browsers to analytics.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.200]  So once your site is off and running,
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.200]  you can see where people are coming from
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.800]  and how many people are looking at what on your site.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.360]  And if you wanna have a blog
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.040]  or you wanna publish a podcast,
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.520]  they have the CMS built in so you can put new posts
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.280]  or new episodes, if it's a podcast,
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.560]  right there on your site all through Squarespace itself.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.880]  So if you have the idea, and right now,
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.060]  I'm not trying to tell you it's, you know,
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.840]  but look, we're all at home.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.120]  I know a lot of people are sort of like doing,
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.840]  it's almost like New Year's in April where it's like,
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.640]  well, I've been meaning to do blank for a long time
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.120]  and you're doing things around the house.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.540]  Like you've got like a table
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:34.360]  that's always had one leg too short
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.300]  and now you're putting, you know, fixing it
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.400]  so that the table doesn't wobble anymore.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.680]  Well, if one of those things in the back of your head
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.880]  or on your to-do list has been to update an old website
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.080]  with something new or to build a brand new website
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.400]  for something, Squarespace is a fantastic way to start.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.240]  It really is, yes, they are sponsoring the show
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.560]  and I'm telling you about them right now
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.680]  because they're a sponsor, but I really would
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.800]  if you came to me and said,
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.200]  hey, John, I need to get started with a new website.
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.280]  What should I do?
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.440]  I would tell you to try Squarespace.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.880]  See how far you can go in a couple of hours.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.800]  You get a free trial and then after the free trial,
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.020]  they have great pricing, but they also have a great deal.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.520]  Just for listeners of the show,
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.080]  you go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.880]  That way they know you came here from the show
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.760]  and just the same code as the URL slug right there.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.480]  Just remember that code, talk show.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.680]  Know the, when you sign up to pay
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.500]  after your free trial's over and you save 10%
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:35.400]  and you could save that 10% on a whole year at one time.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.600]  So go to squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.120]  and remember that code talk show
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.680]  when you actually go to pay after your free trial's over
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.340]  and my thanks to them.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.080]  So face ID, touch ID, people not trusting it.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.520]  I definitely think and I know, I think just sort of,
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.320]  I don't know, I have no inside information.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.960]  Nobody at Apple has told me anything
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.480]  about when anything might be coming,
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.720]  either officially from Apple PR
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.800]  or unofficially from friends who work there.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.000]  I know nothing in terms of when this iPhone 9
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.220]  or some people seem to think it's based on some clues
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.720]  of screen protectors and stuff like that
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.160]  that prematurely hit the market,
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.880]  that it might just be called the iPhone SE again,
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.080]  not even the SE2.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.120]  They're just gonna reuse the name iPhone SE,
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.680]  but now it looks like an iPhone 8.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.260]  I suspect though it's coming next week.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.360]  Just there's a couple of rumor people
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.800]  who seem to think it's coming next week.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.160]  I think it definitely was originally supposed to come
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.000]  in March and it was delayed because the whole supply chain
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.900]  got disrupted by the global pandemic that started in China.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.960]  And everybody remembers that when the first iPhone SE
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.080]  shipped a couple of years ago, it was surprisingly popular,
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.400]  even to Apple, even to the point where Apple,
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.440]  like Tim Cook on the quarterly call,
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.360]  like three months after it came out had to say,
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.520]  yes, we were surprised by the popularity of this product.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.640]  And you had to admit it because if you went to apple.com
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.080]  at the time and tried to buy one, it was like,
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.000]  six weeks shipping or three to four weeks
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.060]  or something like that.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.280]  Whereas most Apple products you buy it and ding dong,
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.620]  it shows up the next day.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:25.220]  I have, I'm just searching my inbox as I,
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.220]  my, I have so many readers and I don't know if it's
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:32.140]  cause they skew a little bit older.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:35.900]  Yes, many of my subscriber readers are older.
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:40.740]  So many readers following the reviews that I did
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:44.300]  in the fall of the new iPhones were asking for this phone.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.760]  Yeah.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.480]  To the point where they were saying they were thinking
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.100]  about going to Android because they preferred,
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:52.260]  it was a combo of the two things,
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.940]  smaller and fingerprint sensor.
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:56.940]  And I haven't, I have to sift through a lot of these,
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.100]  but I mean, I just searched right now,
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.780]  iPhone SE and I get, yes, 65 responses
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:04.140]  just on the first page.
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.200]  Well, 50 responses in another, it says 65.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:13.700]  I think, I think this will be a, it is like,
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.820]  people know that this phone is coming
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.620]  and they're waiting for it and they will buy it.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:21.420]  I, and I, you know, I talk about my mom
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.140]  somewhat frequently on the show
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:28.260]  and I don't mention her in specifically
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.260]  as opposed to my dad.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:33.100]  I know there's like a, like a trope that it's, you know,
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.580]  oh, you're, you know, your grandmother or my case,
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:38.420]  my mom who is a grandmother, then you bring it up
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:41.380]  because it's, you know, the, the, you know,
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:43.220]  you're bringing up a woman because you think
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.500]  they're the technically inept ones.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.660]  My mom is far more technically adept than my dad.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.820]  My dad doesn't even have an iPhone.
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:54.220]  He just, when he, he texts and he has,
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:58.520]  he does use iMessage, but he uses it from their iMac.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.980]  But when my dad texts me from a phone,
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:04.300]  like when they're at a doctor or something like that,
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:07.900]  he just texts from my mom's phone and says, dad here.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:11.700]  But he's also, he also just doesn't want to spend the money.
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.700]  He doesn't even want to spend the money
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.100]  like when my mom gets a new iPhone,
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.980]  which she, and she's waiting for this one.
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.740]  She wants the one with the button
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.900]  because she knows how to use it.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:25.860]  And he won't even take her old iPhone, which still works.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.260]  It just sort of is at the point
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:28.340]  where she's had it for enough years,
[01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:31.740]  where it's sort of not a great battery life situation.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:34.040]  It's, you know, usable and she doesn't use it a lot,
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.580]  but she wants to get a new one.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.780]  He won't even use her old one
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:39.540]  because he doesn't want to spend whatever it costs,
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.340]  $15, $20, whatever it would cost to add another phone
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.860]  to their phone line, doesn't want to spend it.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:45.980]  Just won't do it.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:49.780]  But she's more technically adept than my dad by far.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:54.020]  She's much more clever than she gives herself credit for,
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.940]  but she just feels like she's mastered her iPhone
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:00.820]  and doesn't want to learn something new.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:03.300]  She just doesn't, and she has me.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.540]  And I'm, I think, a good son and I'll, you know,
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.960]  she could get a Face ID based iPhone
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.380]  and I would talk her through
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:13.420]  everything she needed to be talked through.
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.940]  And I know that she would get it very quickly.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.660]  I think Apple did a great job by reinventing
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.740]  the fundamental interface where, okay,
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:24.140]  that button that you used for everything, it's gone.
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:25.900]  And now you just swipe up from the bottom
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:27.340]  and you can kind of do everything
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.980]  that you used to do with the button just by swiping up.
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.820]  She would get it.
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:31.900]  I know she would.
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:35.180]  She doesn't want to try and she doesn't believe it.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.540]  I have the same with my parents,
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.820]  but mostly with these readers, I'm now looking through it.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.980]  And I have this one reader, this is like,
[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:45.040]  he says, the home button is such a simple concept,
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.500]  Apple doesn't seem to understand that.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.140]  I am sure that there are no seniors on their design team.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.020]  And then he signs it, I'm not gonna give his name,
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:56.580]  senior citizen blank, his name.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.420]  Another person, again, two reasons
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.060]  I'm waiting for this new phone.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.220]  I refuse to give up my home button is number one.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.660]  Two, facial recognition is not for me.
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:08.500]  But I get it.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.100]  So I'm super excited just for this phone
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:11.220]  to help these people.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:14.520]  Yeah, and I do think that that is, you know, and again,
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.620]  I don't know for a fact that Apple,
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.420]  if there had been no global pandemic,
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.740]  that they would have announced it in March,
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:24.100]  but I strongly suspect that they would have,
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:26.980]  that it might have been some sort of media event
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.460]  of some kind where they would have done it
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:32.780]  alongside the iPads and the MacBook Air, maybe,
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.100]  or something, I don't know.
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.860]  But I believe it that they were delayed.
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.500]  And I think that one of the reasons
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:38.820]  that they wanted to wait,
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:40.900]  if assuming that's true, that it was delayed,
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:44.300]  is they're anticipating this being very popular.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.620]  And, you know, and if it starts at 399 bucks,
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:52.620]  and it's got the modern A series chip from the iPhone 11s,
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.100]  and I think it's gonna be very popular.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.300]  And so I feel like they definitely didn't,
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.540]  even if they could have announced it in March
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:02.100]  and had it and said like, oh, but it, you know,
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.600]  it's gonna, you know, it would be available
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.740]  in three or four weeks.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.940]  They want this thing to be ready
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:08.740]  because I think they're anticipating a large number of,
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:12.620]  you know, I think just like the original iPhone SE
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:13.460]  a couple years ago,
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.420]  I think it's gonna be very popular.
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:17.660]  Yeah, and I mean, like I said, this is always,
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:19.380]  when I review the new iPhones,
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.540]  there's always that crowd that's like,
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:23.000]  I'm not the early adopter.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.820]  I do not want all of this new stuff.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.340]  I want this.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.200]  I love my iPhone.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.380]  I like these things about it.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:30.500]  I want it to stay the same.
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:33.080]  I want now a better camera like the rest of the world
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.360]  and it to be faster, but everything else the same.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.200]  Yeah.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.020]  And this is for them.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:40.200]  And like that, I mean, I mean, I guess that's my review.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.800]  It's an unusual position for Apple
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.700]  to be in, although maybe, you know,
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:48.180]  they kind of were in that position with iPods
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:50.900]  15 years ago, but not even the iPod
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.860]  was never anywhere near as popular as the iPhone.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.640]  Like they're really in, the iPhone is so popular
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.620]  that there's only a handful of technologies
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.780]  that have ever had that many users.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:06.060]  I mean, there's Microsoft Windows,
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.180]  certainly Google, Google search.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.780]  There's a reason, number one, it's just brilliant
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:13.900]  that you just, you type google.com.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.960]  It's still one of the great technical marvels
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.660]  in the history of human civilization
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:20.620]  that the Google homepage, it's just this one box
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:24.780]  with a button and the extra goofy I got lucky button
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.820]  and you type a question in there and you hit return
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.660]  and you get answers.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.160]  It's amazing.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.340]  But there's a reason why Google,
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.600]  all the, everything that changed about Google
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.800]  as a company in 20 years, there's a reason google.com
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.360]  is still just a text box with a white background
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:46.220]  and a button, it works and people are familiar with it.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.580]  And the basic, I'm not saying that Apple
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:53.260]  is going to have home button touch ID iPhones forever.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:56.460]  Probably not, Apple will eventually, I think,
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.380]  move forward somehow.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:04.380]  But I feel like the insane popularity of the iPhone
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:08.100]  to the level of reaching normal people
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:10.660]  who once they're familiar with the thing,
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:12.900]  and rightly so, this isn't me complaining
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:16.900]  about non-nerds who won't just get with it
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:18.620]  and switch to a whole new paradigm
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:20.540]  for getting around their phone.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.700]  I totally get it that a normal person
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:25.700]  who's become, mastered their iPhone,
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.620]  why in the world would they want something different?
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:29.540]  All they want is, hey, if I could just get one
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.740]  with better battery life and if the camera's better too,
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.740]  that's great, but don't change anything.
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:38.260]  Right, and it feels like, I mean, it will be interesting
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.700]  to see how Apple positions this,
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:42.120]  but it feels like this is the iPhone
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.340]  that Apple doesn't want to make,
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:46.980]  but they do it or they're going to do it
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.860]  because they know people want it.
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.660]  It always seems like Apple doesn't usually bend
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.700]  to those situations, but maybe in this case,
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.620]  they do know there's such a user base and audience for it.
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.140]  And maybe they just, I don't know.
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:08.060]  I mean, it also seems, we don't know the size of the screen.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:10.140]  It seems like a lot of the reports point to it
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.980]  actually being 4.7 and not four, like the current SE.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:16.580]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be exactly the same size
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:18.340]  as the iPhone 8, 4.7.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:20.740]  I think that if you show it side by side
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:23.580]  with an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 7,
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:25.380]  you won't be able to tell it apart
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:29.740]  other than by turning it on and going to the settings about
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:31.100]  to see what the hell it is.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:34.100]  So then that's gonna leave us the question
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.700]  of why they have it.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:40.700]  Well, I think it's because they can sell it for $399
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:48.420]  and because the familiarity is going to be a selling point
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.820]  to a whole ton of people.
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:53.260]  Right, but I just bought an iPhone 8
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:56.100]  for a video I did a couple of weeks ago for 500 bucks
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:58.380]  and it's the same size.
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:00.980]  If it's presumably gonna be the same size as this,
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:04.900]  then they cheap out on a couple of the different internals,
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:09.020]  maybe on the camera, but otherwise it's the same.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:10.300]  Or maybe it's a little bit smaller
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.420]  and maybe they've engineered it so there's less of a bezel
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:14.580]  and it's a smaller phone.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:16.340]  Well, and I think it also is a thing
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.860]  that like the previous iPhone SE,
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:22.780]  it's not a product that's on an annual schedule.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.140]  It is something that they'll be selling.
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:28.180]  Let's just say they call it the iPhone SE again.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.020]  That's the iPhone SE again.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:34.060]  That they might be selling the iPhone SE again
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.580]  for the next two and a half, three years, who knows?
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:40.300]  Right, and then the 8 goes away next year
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:42.780]  when the new phones come out.
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.940]  Right, or maybe it goes away
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:46.940]  when they debut this thing next week or the week after
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.540]  or whenever it's going to be.
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:52.400]  I do feel like they might alter the design here
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.260]  just to make it a little bit smaller.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.340]  I don't know.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:59.340]  To hit that note, I don't know.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.820]  We'll see.
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:01.820]  I don't think so though.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.940]  I think that the same way that the original iPhone SE
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.340]  looked exactly like an iPhone 5S
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.180]  is what they're going to do with this.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:13.140]  And the design might just be slightly different
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.780]  and then it's got,
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:17.820]  I'm just trying to imagine what the specs are
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:20.480]  that are different from the 8 that's on shelves right now
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.700]  for 500 bucks or whatever.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.420]  Well, I think it'll have the A series chip,
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:28.140]  the A13 from, I think, from the iPhone 11
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.600]  and that would give it years of leg room
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.120]  for software updates and stuff
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.220]  and some kind of better camera
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:40.220]  and better battery life through more efficient components
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.780]  and that's it and there you go.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:45.020]  So here's my question.
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.020]  My last thing I want to talk about before we sign off
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:50.980]  is going back to your comment earlier
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:52.940]  because this is what reminded me of it
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:55.620]  is that a big part of this is that if,
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:58.860]  and I'm pulling the $399 starting price,
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.060]  that's just a guess, I don't know.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.740]  Maybe it's going to start at 499.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.460]  Maybe 399 is too optimistic
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.260]  but it's certainly going to be a brand new iPhone
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:08.860]  that Apple's just released in 2020
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:11.620]  with years ahead of it in software updates
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:16.420]  and speed that'll be more than usable for typical people
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:19.420]  for years to come at a much,
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:23.820]  half the price of an iPhone 11, right?
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.900]  Or at least half the price of an iPhone 11 Pro.
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:27.740]  Much lower price.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:30.780]  Hopefully like $100 less than the current eight
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:33.420]  which starts at, I'm just looking it up, was 450.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.780]  Right, this is the big thing that sticks out to me
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:40.020]  about the MacBooks is the iPads too
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:43.720]  have this wide range of prices available.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:47.900]  So the iPad Pros, yeah, start at a high price
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.860]  but there's the iPad Air
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:51.580]  which they brought the name back out
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:53.120]  and it's a much lower price
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:55.920]  and then they have the just plain iPad with no adjective
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.440]  which starts at a really low price.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.420]  Yeah, like 329.
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:03.260]  Yeah, and they have keyboard cases available
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:07.300]  that you can open up and they work with Bluetooth keyboards
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:09.320]  so there's third party stuff that you can buy
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.400]  if you want to use it
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:15.220]  and they all get the trackpad support, right?
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:18.700]  Which is really cool that this whole new trackpad support
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.320]  that everybody's so excited about
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.320]  and everybody wants to see these 300 to $350 magic trackpads
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.480]  that are coming out for the iPad Pros
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.880]  but there's a Logitech cover with a built-in trackpad
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.160]  that Apple collaborated with Logitech on
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:34.740]  that's a lower price
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.740]  and it'll work with the lower price iPads
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:41.620]  but the MacBooks still start at 999
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:44.800]  and we can be happy that the MacBook Air
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.240]  with the retina and the new keyboard
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.900]  and it's not like they're selling
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.440]  a two-year-old MacBook Air for 999.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.540]  It's brand new and it's really good
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:57.800]  but 999 is actually a pretty high starting point
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.440]  if the MacBook is the platform you want to get in on
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.880]  and the iPhone has a lower starting point,
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.240]  the iPad has several options at lower starting point
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.720]  and that to me, I don't know what Apple should do about it
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.760]  but I kind of feel like that's one way
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.920]  where they're really steering people towards iPads
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.920]  where it's like, okay, if your budget
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.480]  for a laptop-ish type thing is five or $600,
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.660]  you can't even really consider a new MacBook.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.800]  You're either looking at a used MacBook or a new iPad.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.120]  It feels like on the iPhone,
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.960]  they're gonna have the greatest price scale.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.280]  If you think that iPhones, I mean,
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:45.960]  you have the Macs that goes up to what, I mean, $2,000?
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:50.640]  Yeah, I'm enjoying your son's meltdown.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.760]  Yeah, is that what's happening upstairs?
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.240]  I don't know.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.080]  I don't know.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:55.900]  I think it might be singing.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:57.680]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I can't really tell
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.720]  if he's really happy or really upset.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.080]  Oh no, he's screaming, he's upset.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:03.920]  Oh, okay.
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:09.040]  I wish I knew what he's, I mean, it's just so funny
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.280]  the things that he cries about these days too.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.620]  Yeah, it's been, yeah.
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:16.040]  We gotta get your dog in here.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:17.240]  What's your dog's name, Pixel?
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.680]  No.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:19.520]  Browser.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.760]  Browser, I knew it was something technical.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.040]  Yeah, and he hasn't bothered me.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:23.240]  He hasn't wanted to come in here,
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.080]  which means that my son's upstairs probably feeding him
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.240]  whatever he's been eating for dinner or snacks,
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.080]  so that's why he's not in my office.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.000]  How is Browser doing with everybody staying?
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.340]  Do you think Browser notices, or is Browser just like,
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:38.240]  hey, this is cool, everybody's here, all my people are here?
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:42.780]  Browser is, first of all, very dirty,
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.520]  because we can't get him groomed.
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:49.260]  So he's very long and shaggy, and I,
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.520]  you know, it's just not easy to groom a dog.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.180]  I've watched a lot of YouTube videos,
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.080]  and I'm just like, me and my wife are like,
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.200]  we don't think we should do this.
[01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:58.920]  This does not seem like a good idea.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.000]  Even though we've bought a lot of the supplies,
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.240]  we're just like, he either is just gonna end up
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:06.000]  like, you know, just having a lopsided haircut,
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.880]  or we just worry that we could hurt him.
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:09.720]  Right, right.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:13.240]  So we're just hoping that in a month
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.300]  we can take him to a groomer.
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:19.160]  If anyone on the show is a secret underground groomer
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:22.040]  in the New York, New Jersey area, please contact me.
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:25.920]  But really.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:31.560]  But yeah, no, he's, I think he's annoyed.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.620]  He's truly annoyed, especially by my son,
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:35.900]  who thinks that he's like his brother,
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:37.920]  and like, they just, he just pulls his tail
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.000]  and tries to play games with him all day.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.280]  And he's here all the time now.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.120]  Yeah, he's here all the time, he never goes outside.
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.780]  I mean, we go outside, we go for walks and stuff, but yeah.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:49.800]  Dogs are usually the opposite, where dogs are like,
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.660]  oh my God, I'm so glad you're home, I'm so glad you're home,
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.500]  where have you been, where have you been,
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:53.340]  I'm so glad you're home.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:55.760]  But I feel like at some level, dogs also,
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.760]  they may not realize it,
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.800]  but they kinda like their alone time too.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.520]  I think he was that way the first couple of weeks,
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.180]  like the first week and a half, he's like,
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:06.200]  oh my God, you know, you're in your office
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.280]  and my wife's upstairs, like I can go back and forth
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.360]  and you guys are right both here, this is amazing.
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.280]  And then I think he realized, wait,
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.500]  they're like not leaving during the middle of the day.
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:17.160]  And also we canceled our dog walker
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.840]  because we don't want anyone coming in the house,
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.200]  so in the middle of the day, both of them,
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.180]  who's like, we're fighting over who has to walk the dog,
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:26.180]  and if he's lucky, he gets walked for 10 minutes.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.880]  Because we're like, we gotta get back to work
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.720]  or something like that, maybe we've extended our walks
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.840]  in the morning and the evening, but yeah.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:34.680]  You've got stuff to do.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.520]  Tough times for dogs.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:39.880]  Yeah, I mean, he has made a lot of appearances in my videos,
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:42.120]  so that has made him happy, I think.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.840]  He does get very excited when he sees
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.320]  that people like the videos.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.200]  Well, that's the very last thing I wanted to talk about
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.280]  is that you even mentioned it,
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.360]  that you've taken on and expanded,
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.800]  you've always had videos that accompany your columns,
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:57.440]  but now you've taken on a role where you're in charge
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  of this whole video team at thejournal.com.
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:03.780]  They still can't.
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:04.600]  I mean, I'm not anymore.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.520]  I did that for about a year, about two years,
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.960]  or a year and a half ago.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.200]  I didn't realize that.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.280]  So you're not leading the video team anymore.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.760]  No, I'm not leading the video team anymore,
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:19.360]  but I do produce some videos on the side
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:21.880]  and work with some of the teams in our department
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.720]  to work on some longer form pieces.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:27.800]  And I manage a small team of stuff that works on my stuff
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.560]  and other things, mostly related to technology.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.080]  I did a sort of executive produced a big piece last year
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.160]  on Amazon.
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.000]  It was a three-part series.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.160]  We just finished working on a long piece that is,
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.520]  I'll publish it at some point, I don't know when,
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:50.320]  but it's a 30-minute documentary that I worked on on my own
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:55.320]  that, well, it's a deep subject about death and technology.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.060]  I wanted to play around with something a little bit
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:02:59.920]  different than what I typically do.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.800]  So I worked on that for the last couple of months,
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:04.240]  and now I'm starting to, again, get back into leading
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.120]  some other smaller projects on the video team
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:06.960]  at The Journal.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.160]  So do you feel like as you're writing your columns now
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:15.440]  during this as your home, is it harder to do the videos
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.920]  or easier or just different?
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:21.340]  Because obviously production quality has to go down
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:24.040]  to some degree because you can't go to a studio.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.460]  You're at home.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.240]  It is maddeningly hard.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.000]  It is maddening and it is very hard.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.680]  And I have a great producer.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:35.720]  His name is Kenny, Kenny Wasis.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:38.040]  He's a fan of your show, so you might actually be listening.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:38.880]  Hello, Kenny.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.880]  He is, so we can't shoot together and he's shot,
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.300]  he shoots and produces and edits all my stuff.
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:50.000]  And we've been working together for the last, I don't know,
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.240]  maybe like six, eight months now.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.980]  And we've done some really ambitious things
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:54.820]  over those times.
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.200]  He did the bubble video.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.120]  We did the Renaissance video for the iPhone review.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:04.120]  I can't think of some other ones that we've done.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:06.680]  And so we've really up production quality on those.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.920]  But at this point though, I'm shooting with an iPhone.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.000]  I had to like figure out,
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.580]  I mean, I've shot with iPhones before,
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.160]  but I've had to upgrade all my stuff
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.280]  to shoot with an iPhone, do audio here, do tracking.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.720]  I mean, I have a whole, have that all set up at the office.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.860]  And so I've just been spent,
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:25.840]  I spent the first two weeks sort of troubleshooting
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.520]  the setup and now I'm kind of set up, but it's still hard.
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.400]  It's everything from shooting takes a number of hours,
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:35.420]  even if they're short scripts to media management
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:36.880]  and then getting that all on my computer
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.760]  and then uploading it to him to edit,
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.160]  making sure audio is okay
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:42.320]  when there's a two and a half year old in the house.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:45.120]  So I can only really shoot and track my stuff
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.260]  in the evening.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.600]  That's why I also tried to push you off
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.440]  to doing the evening
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:51.880]  because he usually naps from like two to four.
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:55.720]  So yeah, it's all been a, I don't want to come,
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:59.180]  like I keep saying, I'm like, I'm not gonna complain.
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.480]  I love my job, I have a job.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:05.640]  I feel still like I've got some creative spirit
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.560]  though I feel like it's kind of been dwindling
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.240]  over the last couple of weeks
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.680]  and I just need a little bit of a break
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:13.020]  and I really do hope at some point soon
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.640]  we can get back to some semblance of normal
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.920]  for a lot of reasons, but yeah, I don't want to complain,
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:19.120]  but it's definitely not been easy.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.040]  Yeah, I figured you would say that
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:24.960]  because it just is such an inherently collaborative medium.
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.320]  And I know that there's some people
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:28.400]  who do their YouTube channels all by themselves
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.200]  and I don't know how they do it,
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.800]  but I know that a lot of the,
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.820]  especially the higher concept stuff that you've done,
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:36.160]  I mean, the Renaissance Fair one really comes to mind,
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.780]  but it's such a high concept.
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:42.440]  It's clearly just a large-scale collaboration.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.560]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:46.560]  And I mean, that even just like connection with Kenny
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:48.640]  or my producer or Kenny, who is my producer,
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.040]  other producers in the office.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:53.880]  I mean, and also we have this constraint right now
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:56.120]  where I actually have a couple of big ideas
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.800]  I want to pitch and get the budgets for.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.240]  It's a lot of the stuff that I've done.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.000]  My independent stuff actually doesn't cost
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:02.840]  that much money to do,
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:05.160]  even though I think a lot of people think that it does.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.980]  We are a very, very savvy team and we keep costs quite low,
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:11.260]  even on the things that you think would be very expensive,
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:13.080]  we keep the costs very low.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.860]  But on some of the other stuff I've led,
[02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:16.680]  this three-part Amazon series that I led
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.980]  that was a considerable budget,
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:19.320]  this documentary I'd been working on
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:20.720]  is a considerable budget.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:23.160]  You want to have people in the room
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:24.720]  to sort of talk through how we're going to invest,
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:25.560]  what are we going to do?
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.360]  What's the timeline going to look like?
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:30.500]  That, I just, I can't imagine leading from afar,
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.280]  especially on the shoot.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.880]  We are sending shooters out in some regards.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:39.160]  Some of our people have the right equipment
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:41.420]  and they can go out into the world and go shoot,
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:43.200]  but that's very limited right now.
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.920]  Most media organizations are trying to limit that, right?
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.520]  They're trying to keep most of their reporters
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:49.580]  where out of harm's way, if they can.
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:51.960]  And especially like, you know,
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.760]  some of the topics that I'd want to go after doesn't,
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.120]  they intersect right now.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.440]  Like there are some certain coronavirus stories
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.360]  that I'm very interested in the intersection with tech
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.980]  and coronavirus is obviously we've been talking about,
[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:07.520]  but yeah, I just think it's definitely hard.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:08.840]  It's been a very big adjustment.
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:10.440]  Yeah, I imagine so.
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:13.280]  Well, it was delightful to talk to you.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.120]  You too.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:14.960]  I really did enjoy it.
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.960]  Are we going to start recording the podcast now?
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:17.800]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.520]  You still ready to hit start?
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:20.360]  I'm ready to go.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.680]  What do we, yeah, no,
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:23.520]  I'm totally good for another two hours.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.800]  Yeah, is your stomach though?
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:29.200]  No, my stomach isn't, but that means I don't have to deal
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:32.280]  with my screaming toddler upstairs, so yeah.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:33.240]  All right, Joanna Stern.
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:34.440]  How's your son been doing?
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.280]  He's great.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.320]  You know, he's 16, he's in 10th grade,
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.520]  school is canceled in Pennsylvania through the end of the,
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.320]  well, not canceled, he has online schooling.
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.280]  When did he get to be 16?
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.800]  I know, it's crazy.
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.960]  The, you know, he can self-direct if anything,
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.880]  it seems from the grades we get,
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:53.800]  he's actually doing better.
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:57.520]  We were worried that he would blow it all off
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:58.960]  and think, ah, you know, roll his eyes.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:00.640]  He's, you know, doing his work.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:04.880]  It's, I think we're on week four since he's been at home.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.280]  Part of that was the spring break,
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.400]  so it wasn't nonstop school.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.520]  But socially, the thing that's interesting,
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:14.080]  and I think that the girls, I'm sure,
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:16.320]  are having a harder time than the boys,
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:21.320]  but his friends, they socialize over the internet
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:24.520]  anyway, they don't like to get together, really.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.640]  It just seems like that's a pain.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:29.520]  And, you know, if you go out and get together,
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.800]  you've gotta come home and you have curfew,
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:35.400]  and it's like, if you're just doing it all over Discord
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.600]  and playing games, you're both, A, playing your games
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:44.000]  and talking to your pals, and it's a lot easier
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.940]  to stay up really late doing it
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:48.600]  because you haven't left the house, you know?
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.320]  And so socially, him and his friends,
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.000]  I don't think they're doing anything differently
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.960]  than they would do if there was no quarantine.
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:58.920]  You know, they prefer to spend their spring breaks
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.120]  collaborating, you know, palling around
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.240]  over their computers and phones.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.680]  It's very, very different, you know?
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.520]  Nothing is more different about his life
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:12.000]  than my life at the same age as a teenager.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.640]  I couldn't wait to get out of the house
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:16.420]  every chance I could get when I was 16.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:19.520]  Yeah, maybe you also don't know the full story.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:21.040]  You don't think he wants to go out and party
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.420]  with his friends at least a little,
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:24.960]  or like go, you know, he's 10th grade?
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.800]  Doesn't seem like it.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.600]  I mean, I think he misses it a little.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.120]  I think the fact that it's four weeks
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.440]  and it hasn't seen anybody,
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.120]  it's gotta be weighing on him a little,
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:35.460]  but I don't think it's anywhere near as big a deal.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:38.760]  You know, just talking to the other parents that we know,
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.460]  the girls in his class clearly get together physically,
[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:45.660]  you know, in normal times, physically,
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.320]  and go shopping together,
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.720]  and they go out to eat and stuff.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:50.040]  Right, and sleepovers and stuff.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.660]  And sleepovers, and it's, you know,
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:54.060]  they're just, it's just the difference
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:56.480]  between girls and boys in some way.
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:59.600]  You know, and I just don't think the girls
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:02.600]  don't wanna spend 18 hours a day playing video games.
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:06.220]  They have a wider range of interests.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.400]  Right, ugh, I just can't believe he's 16.
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.700]  I feel like, I mean, I probably did meet him
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:14.760]  when he was, was he probably eight or 10 or something?
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:16.920]  Maybe, probably younger, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.960]  Yeah, it's crazy, but he's doing well, you know.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:22.200]  And, you know, all three of us are, you know,
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.640]  homebodies to some degree,
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.280]  so I think we're doing better than a lot of people.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.600]  You know, my dad, I think is, my dad's a real extrovert,
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.440]  and really, you know, it's just everybody, you know,
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.400]  it's a town where he lives, everybody knows Bob Gruber.
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:39.000]  You know, I think it's kinda driving him nuts
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.760]  not seeing everybody that he normally sees on his daily,
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:45.400]  just walk around and go get coffee and go here,
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.880]  and, you know, he just has this whole routine
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  in retired life where he like goes one place to get coffee
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:51.800]  and then goes somewhere else
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.200]  to buy a scratch-off lottery ticket.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:55.040]  Like, why don't you-
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.840]  And play bingo, I mean, I was playing bingo.
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:58.360]  Right, but it's like, I'm like, I say to him,
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:00.080]  like, why don't you just buy lottery tickets
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.720]  at Jake's where you buy the coffee?
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:02.780]  And he's like, oh, well, I, you know,
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:04.320]  and I realize, he doesn't wanna say it,
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.380]  but he just wants somewhere else to go, you know?
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:07.220]  And now he doesn't go anywhere.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.100]  I'm that way, I'm definitely that way.
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.240]  Yeah, I miss the, like I said, I miss the office so much,
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.920]  it's like sad, I'm like, am I just a sad person
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.320]  how much I love the office?
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.960]  I just, I love my office,
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.080]  and so I love the people I work with and yeah, well.
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:23.960]  All right, Joanna, thanks.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:48.560]  Great to talk to you.
