[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Mg
[00:01.720 --> 00:05.360]  John long time no long time. No here. Yeah, how are you?
[00:06.360 --> 00:11.520]  Very good been too long. So what what are you up to these days? What are you what the hell are you doing? So?
[00:12.240 --> 00:17.100]  I came back from the UK. I was over there for a year helping to set up
[00:17.880 --> 00:23.000]  Google Ventures European operations over there and with that off the ground I came back
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.680]  About I guess more than six months ago. Now is sometime last summer. It's actually
[00:27.680 --> 00:34.320]  We're going we're heading back to the UK for the first time in since we left and so it's almost been a year
[00:34.960 --> 00:38.640]  Anyway, so back on the ground in San Francisco now
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.560]  back just to doing US Google Ventures now called GV as a part of the alphabet stuff, you know, so
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.200]  Google Ventures is one of the
[00:50.480 --> 00:52.080]  alphabet
[00:52.080 --> 00:55.760]  Companies that's a sister company now to Google versus being you know under
[00:55.760 --> 01:03.960]  Google same same basic idea, but they would prefer we use the name GV instead of Google Ventures now
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.560]  Right as part of the whole if it's really a sibling to Google and part of alphabet
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.880]  It shouldn't be called Google right exactly. So so yeah, so back but doing the same stuff just
[01:16.840 --> 01:18.280]  investing in
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.360]  You know mainly early stage early to mid stage companies here
[01:22.360 --> 01:27.840]  What do you do you think that having spent a whole year in in the UK
[01:28.480 --> 01:30.480]  When you came back did it?
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.720]  Did you look at at the the valley?
[01:35.560 --> 01:40.480]  Culture and sort of feel like you had fresh eyes or did feel like just instantly like, you know what I'm home
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.520]  It's a good question because I did think about that the longer sort of I was over there
[01:46.080 --> 01:48.760]  And obviously we were coming back fairly regularly
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.600]  I think I was back at least once a quarter in the in the u.s
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.680]  And mainly in the Bay Area when I came back
[01:55.680 --> 02:01.640]  but still the longer I was over there you do start to get detached from it and I
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.160]  Felt like I was able to look at it from much more of a outsider perspective
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.800]  After having lived in the Bay Area for almost 10 years
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.520]  You know concurrently
[02:11.960 --> 02:13.720]  and
[02:13.720 --> 02:15.560]  It was
[02:15.560 --> 02:17.560]  interesting coming back and
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.080]  And you do feel like you get just like sort of right back into the swing of things almost like you hadn't left
[02:23.080 --> 02:29.280]  but at the same time I had these lingering remembrances of what it was like being over in the UK and sort of
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.960]  Watching remotely both because of what we were talking about with the timezone thing was was one of the more interesting things
[02:35.120 --> 02:37.120]  When I would wake up in the morning
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.800]  It was mostly either people who were up really late or people who were out drinking or something like that were on Twitter
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.560]  And so I would I would have a much much difference
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.600]  Usage of Twitter when I was over there than I do when I'm over here
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.080]  And it's just sort of in the in the thick of it with everyone when I'm over there
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.400]  It's it's almost like you're using it to play catch-up and then talking to a few drunk people
[03:02.520 --> 03:08.800]  So, but anyway, yes, so when I when I came back it did I did get right back into the swing of things
[03:08.800 --> 03:10.800]  But I still have these
[03:10.800 --> 03:13.840]  Hopefully different perspective on
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.320]  You know and how sort of the outside views Silicon Valley versus being in it for a decade
[03:21.720 --> 03:23.720]  And do you think that?
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.480]  Do you think that
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.520]  outside the valley
[03:30.520 --> 03:32.520]  startups are
[03:32.640 --> 03:34.440]  underrepresented by
[03:34.440 --> 03:35.640]  or
[03:35.640 --> 03:37.640]  Over more likely to be overlooked
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.560]  Yeah, like I that's my outsider's perspective. My outsider's perspective. Is that inside the valley?
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.000]  The the focus is so insular because there's so many
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.880]  things going on and so many smart people and so many interesting things that it's it it
[03:54.400 --> 03:57.200]  Cultivates an idea that everything worth looking at is in the valley
[03:57.200 --> 04:02.720]  Yeah, that's a good way to frame because most people, you know talk about well, you're too far in the forest
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.520]  and
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.000]  You know, you guys are just missing sort of what's outside of the valley the reality of the situation
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.360]  At least from my perspective is sort of what you're suggesting
[04:11.400 --> 04:18.360]  Which is that there are so many interesting things going on in Silicon Valley that it's it's honestly just hard as a matter of time
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.560]  To be able to look outside of it unless you happen to be in a locale that's outside of it
[04:23.960 --> 04:28.240]  So most of the people here who are investing here or certain companies here
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.000]  You know are you know very much in the in the thick of it?
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  And so it is it is probably
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  It's definitely fair to say that
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.800]  You know sort of outside of Silicon Valley is under represented
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.160]  underrepresented in the minds of everyone here, but I do think that that's just as much of a function of
[04:48.800 --> 04:52.440]  again, there being so much here to think about and
[04:52.920 --> 04:58.400]  Look at and so it's it's a it's just the proximity and time issue
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.840]  But then when you move to somewhere else like London or any other locale
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.440]  You know then of course, you're you're closer to some of those things and so you start to see outside of that
[05:08.440 --> 05:10.440]  And that's not to say whether or not
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.720]  You know, it's it's a good or bad thing. I think overall everyone would agree
[05:14.720 --> 05:17.360]  it's sort of a bad thing to have blind spots to something if
[05:19.280 --> 05:21.280]  If you're not aware of it, but
[05:21.280 --> 05:28.800]  You know, it's it's an easier thing that's said than done when when the proximity thing is is such a key factor
[05:29.680 --> 05:31.680]  Yeah
[05:33.960 --> 05:35.040]  What
[05:35.040 --> 05:37.480]  I'm trying to think since the last time you've been on this show
[05:37.480 --> 05:43.280]  What are some of the big high-level changes to the type of stuff we talked about? Well Apple's still doomed
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.800]  More doomed than ever that the more the more money they make them, you know, the heart the farther they have to fall
[05:50.800 --> 05:56.840]  So it's gonna be it's a catastrophic fall. That's that's happening. I think they you know only made whatever
[05:58.240 --> 06:02.320]  What did they make 50 50 billion in revenue last quarter something like that? I
[06:05.120 --> 06:09.080]  Yeah, I think so and 10 10 billion in profit, yeah, it's more than you know
[06:09.080 --> 06:15.280]  All all the major other tech companies combined. It's it's way more than any other company, of course including Exxon and all the
[06:15.280 --> 06:21.840]  Maybe oh, but um, you know, what's it Aramco? I guess is about to or not Aramco. It's um
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.400]  What's uh, what's the Saudi one? Oh
[06:25.520 --> 06:29.040]  I forget the name. I know I know what you're talking about, but I forget that
[06:29.040 --> 06:32.160]  It sounds like they're about to go public or spun out partially
[06:32.160 --> 06:36.640]  So we're about to see how much money potentially that they make and it could be something comparable to Apple
[06:36.640 --> 06:40.080]  So it might be the first time we we get something like that
[06:40.080 --> 06:44.240]  Yeah, it's you know, just only compares to the gas and oil companies, yeah
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.960]  And it's kind of funny because we grew up
[06:46.960 --> 06:50.560]  You know, I mean I've even people who are significantly older than us
[06:50.560 --> 06:57.200]  I think grew up in a world where it's just well, of course the gas and oil companies are the biggest companies in the world
[06:57.200 --> 07:04.400]  Right. It's just it's just like that's the world whereas I it's like I'm old enough now to sort of and you know with all the
[07:04.960 --> 07:08.000]  climate change stuff and and all you know
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.440]  the the interest in renewable energy everybody's looking at that, you know and questioning it and and
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.120]  You know, it's no longer taken as a given that this is just the way it is right but
[07:21.120 --> 07:25.120]  I did the math when with all the skepticism with Apple's, you know
[07:25.680 --> 07:29.280]  Quote-unquote bum quarter last quarter and it really was true
[07:29.280 --> 07:32.640]  I think I forget if it was revenue or profit. I think I was looking at profit and yeah
[07:32.640 --> 07:37.680]  It was profit because that's why I I took I took Amazon and I think I think I think I think I think
[07:37.680 --> 07:44.320]  I took Amazon out of the equation because they don't try for profit. So it's right, you know, it's almost like it's like you're
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.680]  You're stacking the deck in the in the favor of Apple by comparing Amazon
[07:49.680 --> 07:56.000]  But I think it was like Google Microsoft and Facebook combined that they had more profit than right, which is just yeah insane
[07:56.960 --> 08:02.880]  Especially like with Microsoft who who and Google too. I think one thing you could Google's often, you know
[08:03.520 --> 08:06.320]  Largely, it's tried for profits, but Microsoft famously
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.480]  You know, it was the most profitable company in the in the industry. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when
[08:13.840 --> 08:18.560]  You know thinking back to I don't even remember how long ago it was six seven years ago or something sort of when I was
[08:18.560 --> 08:22.720]  at tech crunch looking trying to cover sort of the day-to-day of
[08:23.120 --> 08:28.800]  putting into context like just how fast Apple's growing and how big it is relative to some of the other tech companies and
[08:29.440 --> 08:35.360]  I remember both putting it in the context of Microsoft at the time and Microsoft was still leaps and bounds ahead both
[08:35.360 --> 08:40.400]  Certainly in profit and I think in still at revenue at that point
[08:40.400 --> 08:42.640]  But the other one I remember is HP like
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.960]  HP was so far ahead in revenue that it seemed like Apple would never be able to surpass something like that
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.960]  And then you know, it's like 18 months later. It was it was so far in the rearview mirror that it was it was insane
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.120]  Even the even the HP branded iPods couldn't change that. That's right
[09:01.120 --> 09:06.640]  They somehow didn't didn't write the ship and now it's like now HP's been spun out or it's got split up once, right?
[09:06.640 --> 09:09.200]  And I think they just sold a separate
[09:09.840 --> 09:14.640]  Part of the enterprise version that was spun out. So it's like three separate companies
[09:14.640 --> 09:18.800]  Now that was the the one behemoth at that point that seemed seemed like, you know
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.880]  A tech company could never topple those those types of revenues and now it's funny
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.880]  Yeah, and it's like HP is one of those companies. It's not like I ever had a great interest in Hewlett-Packard
[09:28.880 --> 09:31.520]  You know, I mean, but they were at least
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.760]  Relevant to the sphere of things that I read and now it's almost like when an article comes up with a review of like an HP
[09:37.760 --> 09:42.320]  Laptop or something. I'm like, wow HP. I haven't thought about them in like a year. Yeah
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.320]  Yeah, I'm the same way just don't even think about it
[09:44.320 --> 09:50.800]  It's basically only when I like see on tech meme the the earnings report of HP and that's like the only time
[09:50.800 --> 09:52.640]  I'll see like the headline of like yeah
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.600]  They they beat or they slightly missed or whatever on on their their targets for the it's like and it's it's such a
[10:00.240 --> 10:07.040]  Mind-numbing, you know headline to read like just don't have time to really care that much anymore about HP
[10:09.280 --> 10:11.280]  What's the name of Microsoft's tablet
[10:11.840 --> 10:12.960]  Surface
[10:12.960 --> 10:20.080]  Surface surface so I just saw a review the other day where where HP came out with like more or less their
[10:20.080 --> 10:22.800]  competitor to the surface and
[10:23.520 --> 10:27.680]  It's it's like it's just like a surface and and they're advertising it
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.520]  But you can open it up and like, you know replace the RAM and you can do this and that and you know
[10:33.520 --> 10:35.520]  It's like all this stuff. That was like
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.720]  The things people wanted to do with their PCs like ten years ago
[10:38.720 --> 10:43.200]  But then like the bottom line is so it's just like a surface and out of the box. It's thicker and heavier
[10:45.280 --> 10:48.400]  That's great good good job good luck with that. Yeah, I
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.080]  But so it's just it's a tablet that with it with the keyboard thing
[10:53.440 --> 10:59.760]  Yeah, I'll try to find the review and I'll put the link in the show that show notes it's I it's I it's just like yeah
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.560]  I don't know some division of HP is still making these things in it. You know squeaked out the side, but it's like
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.880]  It's not surprised
[11:06.880 --> 11:08.320]  Yeah, there it's you know
[11:08.320 --> 11:14.640]  It's the office space guy with the red stapler in the basement who's just doing this and no one realizes it. Yeah
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.960]  Exactly, right. He's still down there making laptops and he's like looking around the industry and he's like, well, I guess that's the new form factor
[11:21.680 --> 11:24.400]  And that's what he made. Yeah, that's exactly it. Yeah
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.120]  You are a I think a a a
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.640]  You've been bullish on uber
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.240]  Right. Yeah, sure. And I mean, you know GV is a pretty big investor, right? Yeah, right
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.240]  So it's you know, you know, let's just go Lowe's and every time GV is an investor right and somebody right but
[11:51.280 --> 11:57.120]  I feel like that again, you know not having had you on the show in a long time that to me that
[11:57.760 --> 11:59.440]  the ride-sharing
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.560]  and you know, it doesn't have to be uber in particular, but it's it's
[12:02.560 --> 12:11.200]  It it seems to be accelerating at a at a at a almost crazy rate and I could be wrong
[12:11.200 --> 12:16.000]  Maybe like one thing I'd a couple years ago. I don't know because about 10 years ago
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.360]  There were a lot here in philly, especially their zip cars was was pretty common. Yeah, and
[12:22.080 --> 12:25.120]  You'd see them and I always noticed it because I noticed that
[12:25.120 --> 12:32.000]  branding and stuff that you know, the cars all had zip cars printed on the side and I knew where all the parking lots were where
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.360]  Where they were and it was something that when we were shopping for a car 10 years ago
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.040]  We considered it. We've really strongly thought maybe we don't have to buy a car
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.640]  maybe we could just do the zip cars thing, but it's like we we kind of like
[12:45.840 --> 12:49.360]  Pretended, you know, like well, let's pretend that we were shopping for a car
[12:49.360 --> 12:55.360]  So we didn't we didn't go for it. We bought a car but I've noticed and this is totally anecdotal
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.360]  But I don't see anywhere near as many zip cars in philadelphia as I used to like it seemed like that got popular
[13:01.360 --> 13:06.960]  And now it's less popular and I can't help but think that it's it's the ride-sharing
[13:06.960 --> 13:14.960]  Well said it's bet so how I think about it. I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[13:14.960 --> 13:22.400]  Ride-sharing. Well said it's bet so how actually I the last time I haven't been in philadelphia in a long time
[13:22.480 --> 13:29.440]  Certainly well well before uber and lyft and whatnot existed. So is uber pretty ubiquitous. Like is that how people yeah people get around well
[13:30.480 --> 13:37.360]  I can't speak for the whole city of philadelphia, but philadelphia center city philadelphia is you know, the downtown part of philadelphia is all centralized
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.180]  It's one contiguous
[13:39.180 --> 13:43.280]  rectangular block and within center city philly it's you know, it it
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.240]  It never more than a five-minute wait for a black car or an suv and uh
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.280]  I don't really do the uber x but it's I think it's even less for that and you know
[13:53.520 --> 13:59.520]  Yep, it's really really and just does philly have public good public transportation or really bad public transportation
[14:00.640 --> 14:02.640]  I would I would qualify it as
[14:03.500 --> 14:08.080]  Mediocre we have two subway lines one that goes east west and one that goes north south
[14:08.160 --> 14:10.560]  So it's just effectively just like a plus
[14:10.560 --> 14:14.240]  That goes right through the center, you know, right through the center of the city
[14:14.720 --> 14:16.080]  so like
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.960]  In the sporting complex all this the the phillies the eagles the sixers all of their stuff is all in one big area
[14:23.440 --> 14:26.800]  Way down in south philly so it's easy from that like if i'm going to a game
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.480]  I just walk to the what we call the broad street line the one that goes north south hop on that and go south
[14:32.560 --> 14:33.760]  And it's great
[14:33.760 --> 14:34.720]  um
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.960]  If you want to go anywhere off that plus grid, it's not so great. I mean there's buses but
[14:38.960 --> 14:45.280]  Yeah, yeah, no, I mean even in the cities now with great public transportation new york, obviously london being another
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.720]  Uh, it's still you're still seeing uber lift and and all all the rest sort of just taking over and becoming huge
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.800]  In all these markets just because I mean, I think there's a number of things at play
[14:56.800 --> 14:59.600]  but but the convenience factor, of course, like just
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.440]  Dialing up something and it and it being there right at your doorstep and taking you exactly to where you need to go
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.240]  Um, uh, you know just makes sense for a lot of people you you talked about your your wife and yourself sort of thinking about
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.080]  If zipcar would make sense, you know when megan my wife and I moved over to london. We sold our cars
[15:19.280 --> 15:24.720]  Here in san francisco. And so when we came back, um, you know, we we thought about what what should we do
[15:25.280 --> 15:28.880]  And right now we still don't have cars. It's been almost a year neither one of us have a car
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.480]  And we do use uber to get everywhere basically
[15:32.480 --> 15:38.480]  A few times we've rented a car like if we're going, um, you know for an extended trip up north or down south
[15:40.080 --> 15:46.720]  But for you know, 99 of our our travel now is with uber and I want to preface that a little bit because I know i'll sound
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.640]  Like the you know that I sound like a silicon valley perhaps stereotype. Um, yeah, we can get everywhere
[15:52.640 --> 15:57.680]  We need to go on uber but like the reality is in a lot of I think metro areas now
[15:57.680 --> 16:03.200]  It can be cheaper depending on
[16:04.160 --> 16:06.560]  Your situation and depending on what you need to do
[16:06.560 --> 16:13.680]  It's obviously a little bit different if you have children and and some other life situations, but uh for the situation that we're currently in
[16:14.240 --> 16:19.680]  It's definitely cheaper for us to to use something like uber and uber x and now uber pool like, you know
[16:19.680 --> 16:26.240]  The uh, the carpooling version of it to get around a city versus owning a car having to pay insurance having to pay for gas
[16:26.240 --> 16:29.120]  Having to pay for parking and everything else that's included
[16:30.640 --> 16:34.800]  Yeah, and it's just it's just one of those things that like it's really opened my eyes to
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.080]  Just I I think I know it sounds so obvious it sounds such a duh
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.680]  But it's like good god
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.960]  Look at all these cars that are parked everywhere and and I know that this is part of the just the basic argument
[16:46.960 --> 16:50.080]  but it's that that the industry is ripe for transportation, but
[16:50.720 --> 16:54.640]  when you're in a city and you just see cars parked everywhere and you see
[16:54.640 --> 16:56.640]  Everywhere and you see, you know
[16:56.960 --> 17:02.960]  buildings that are just parking garages just stacked with cars and you just think all these cars are just sitting here for hours and
[17:02.960 --> 17:05.200]  hours and hours and you think like, you know, and
[17:05.840 --> 17:06.880]  an uber
[17:06.880 --> 17:08.880]  Uh is you know
[17:08.960 --> 17:10.160]  Is always in motion? Yeah
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.720]  I mean, I think that that's a good point and it's something that that gets talked about a little bit but not enough
[17:14.880 --> 17:20.000]  And I think it will be talked about more and more as this becomes more of the reality in more places
[17:20.080 --> 17:22.080]  but you're exactly right like
[17:22.080 --> 17:29.300]  Imagine the future, you know, whether it's it's uber and lift or the eventual sort of self-driving car elements
[17:29.780 --> 17:31.780]  Uh where all of a sudden
[17:32.020 --> 17:37.860]  All of these spaces and cities are unlocked that are just used as you said to sort of like house cars that just sit
[17:37.860 --> 17:39.620]  There all day, which is ridiculous
[17:39.620 --> 17:41.620]  So much so much of city life
[17:41.780 --> 17:48.500]  Is uh taken up by these giant parking garages and when you can unlock that and you no longer need those like cities become
[17:48.500 --> 17:54.020]  You know much better as a result of having all that space sort of freed up and you can put any number of things there
[17:54.020 --> 17:58.260]  Anything you want all these, uh, you know, who knows how much square footage is out there
[17:58.260 --> 18:01.300]  That's that's just devoted to parking but it is a ton
[18:02.820 --> 18:06.260]  Yeah, it's it's you know, and when you think about it and you just don't
[18:06.820 --> 18:11.060]  You know like again, it's like, you know when I first came to philly, you know
[18:11.620 --> 18:15.780]  For college in the early 90s it I just assumed that the city would be full of cars
[18:15.780 --> 18:19.860]  So that's just the world as I knew it. But as I you know question it now, it's
[18:20.420 --> 18:22.420]  This seems ridiculous
[18:22.820 --> 18:24.820]  Yeah, I still do wonder so
[18:25.220 --> 18:30.980]  I grew up in a suburb outside of cleveland. Um, and you know, it's a fairly typical
[18:32.260 --> 18:34.740]  You know midwestern like suburb. Um
[18:35.540 --> 18:36.500]  and
[18:36.500 --> 18:42.820]  There obviously it's not super dense and you had to drive everywhere. And so i've been home a few times
[18:42.820 --> 18:46.260]  um, you know in the past few years and uh, it's
[18:47.220 --> 18:51.700]  They have uber and I do take it but it's not nearly
[18:51.860 --> 18:57.380]  Of course as ubiquitous as it would be in the city like even in downtown cleveland. It would be a lot more ubiquitous. Of course
[18:58.420 --> 19:04.020]  And so I do wonder for like the the suburbs and outside regions like how long that will take to tip
[19:04.020 --> 19:09.460]  But I still think it will like it's just it just I think it will spill out from the cities
[19:09.460 --> 19:13.860]  Into that and it's just a matter of having enough. Um, you know cars
[19:14.420 --> 19:18.580]  On the roads that are that are performing those tasks to be able to do it in a suburban
[19:18.820 --> 19:20.980]  Area as well. Like I know a lot of people still think
[19:21.620 --> 19:23.860]  Um in the suburbs, it's just not feasible
[19:23.860 --> 19:28.580]  You have to go grocery shopping, you know and do all these things that are sort of always a drive away
[19:28.580 --> 19:33.300]  But again at scale i'm not so sure that that's totally unreasonable
[19:34.020 --> 19:36.020]  I was listening to
[19:36.020 --> 19:40.420]  Um one of bill simmons podcast recently and he
[19:42.580 --> 19:49.700]  He I think only half in jest he has a theory that because of uber there are more people having
[19:49.940 --> 19:51.940]  accidental third kids
[19:51.940 --> 19:53.620]  because
[19:53.620 --> 19:57.300]  uber the existence of uber makes it so much easier for
[19:57.940 --> 20:02.500]  Like parents with kids to go out and have a couple drinks at dinner
[20:02.500 --> 20:07.140]  Yeah, than they would in the past like if you had to drive some one of the two of you would have to yeah
[20:07.540 --> 20:12.260]  You know would have to abstain and if both of you know, if you just take an uber to dinner you can both
[20:12.260 --> 20:16.980]  You know, you can both drink and so his theory there's gonna be a lot more families with three kids instead of two
[20:16.980 --> 20:20.980]  That's pretty funny. I like that the the uber boom, you know, like of uh, right
[20:22.260 --> 20:27.700]  Uber's helping the world, uh in in uh in families with families. That's what it's all about
[20:27.700 --> 20:33.140]  But there it's it seems funny because it's you know, it's just a funny idea that people are going to
[20:34.020 --> 20:38.580]  Have extra babies, but but there's a certain logic to it. Yeah. Yeah, I do think it's I mean, don't you?
[20:39.140 --> 20:42.180]  You know, it's sort of the the flip side of that just in general
[20:42.180 --> 20:47.540]  Isn't it great to know like with when you go out in a city or or not anywhere really?
[20:48.180 --> 20:52.580]  You know when you want to have a few drinks like you just do not have to worry about it
[20:52.580 --> 20:57.940]  And that just was not the reality 10 years ago, of course
[20:57.940 --> 21:00.100]  Right, and there's parts of of philly. Um
[21:00.900 --> 21:06.820]  You know, there's I mean it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean anything to if you're not here but like an area we call fish town and and
[21:07.460 --> 21:12.820]  It's like the the gentrified area like the part that was really kind of sketchy even 10 15 years ago
[21:12.820 --> 21:17.620]  And there's all it's sort of like the that's where all the hipster stuff is but there's lots and lots
[21:17.620 --> 21:20.020]  I mean because of that there's it's all sorts of
[21:20.020 --> 21:23.300]  new restaurants that open up open up in that area and it's
[21:24.340 --> 21:31.620]  Always even now that it's more popular grossly underserved by cabs so like you can get a cab to go there easily
[21:31.620 --> 21:34.980]  But then when you want to leave you are, you know
[21:35.700 --> 21:39.060]  Good luck, you know you can and it's actually the type of thing where you you know
[21:39.220 --> 21:43.620]  You'd actually like call a cab company which you know seems like such an old-timey thing to do
[21:43.620 --> 21:47.540]  But then you you know, you wait right and it's like every time I remember from you know
[21:48.100 --> 21:51.860]  In the old days before uber and stuff like that if I did call for a cab
[21:52.500 --> 21:55.300]  You know, you could wait half an hour and then they don't come. Oh, yeah
[21:55.300 --> 22:01.140]  I mean that was that was very much the reality of the situation when I got to san francisco almost 10 years ago
[22:01.780 --> 22:07.060]  And of course this is you know, the everyone knows the thing now like part of the reason why uber came into existence
[22:07.060 --> 22:08.900]  I mean the main story was that
[22:08.900 --> 22:14.100]  They were in uh, paris and and sort of at a at a tech conference and sort of talking about you know
[22:14.100 --> 22:16.180]  Like wouldn't it be cool to have a black car service or whatever?
[22:16.740 --> 22:19.220]  But the reality is that when they got back to san francisco
[22:19.620 --> 22:24.980]  Everyone was living in this reality where san francisco public transportation was awful and it still is awful outside of uber
[22:25.140 --> 22:27.380]  You know muni is the the line here
[22:27.380 --> 22:33.460]  That's um, the public transportation that goes down all the time and is always running late and it's it's a constant joke
[22:33.460 --> 22:38.660]  If you follow like matt honan on on twitter, it's like 50 of his tweets are complaining about muni
[22:39.540 --> 22:45.540]  And then we have the bard system, which is we have all these like sort of half-baked, uh, public transportation things
[22:45.700 --> 22:48.900]  But when I moved to san francisco, I lived in an area called russian hill
[22:49.220 --> 22:54.900]  Uh, which was not connected to any or near any of the public transportation aside from the cable cars
[22:54.900 --> 22:57.940]  Which I would take every once in a while, which is sort of ridiculous
[22:57.940 --> 23:04.260]  Because it's very much, you know, like a tourist thing. And so i'm on there with you know, 50 tourists and i'm trying to take this
[23:04.260 --> 23:10.420]  To commute, uh into soma. Um, and it takes forever because it goes slow to to appreciate the view or whatever
[23:11.060 --> 23:16.980]  But that was the reality, uh of public transportation for me when I moved to san francisco and yeah
[23:16.980 --> 23:20.100]  So like you would see a cab every once in a while
[23:20.100 --> 23:24.020]  But if you if you would have to get lucky to get a cab every once in a while
[23:24.020 --> 23:29.460]  But if you if you would have to get lucky to sort of spot one out there and that was even still like a better
[23:30.340 --> 23:36.820]  Situation than trying to call one. I mean I remember I would call them from my apartment in russian hill and and it would be
[23:36.820 --> 23:40.900]  Often like a 45-minute wait and and about half the time they just wouldn't show up at all
[23:40.900 --> 23:44.500]  So you couldn't trust it and so like when people are talking about, you know
[23:44.500 --> 23:50.260]  like like there's just simple things that led to the rise of of services like uber and they just
[23:50.260 --> 23:55.540]  Why the the cab companies get all mad like, um, you know that that this is happening to them. It's like
[23:56.340 --> 23:58.340]  I mean, they really did do it to themselves
[23:59.140 --> 24:05.140]  Yeah in philly it's again a long story short but the cab situation here is i've told this story on the show before but
[24:05.460 --> 24:07.460]  It really is true philly's cabs are
[24:08.340 --> 24:11.460]  Really lower less regulated in terms of like in
[24:12.020 --> 24:16.580]  Just the I mean we have it's just like new york and other big cities where you have to have a taxi medallion
[24:16.580 --> 24:18.980]  And they limit the number of medallions, you know
[24:19.620 --> 24:26.740]  So it's like artificial scarcity, but the actual cars themselves don't have very high inspection standards and new york
[24:27.140 --> 24:33.860]  Does and so most of the cabs on the road in philadelphia are cabs that failed?
[24:34.660 --> 24:41.700]  Regulate, you know inspection. Oh, that's funny. I just ship they just ship them down the jersey turnpike and sell them to cab companies in philly or
[24:41.700 --> 24:47.460]  Police cruisers, uh, uh, the last time I couldn't remember the name of the car crown victoria's just uh,
[24:47.780 --> 24:53.140]  and and some of them you if you actually pay attention to the crown vic cabs in philly you can actually still see the ones that
[24:53.380 --> 24:54.820]  Have the police
[24:54.820 --> 25:00.840]  In the back. They just they just paint them. They just paint over that's funny and they're just and everybody knows that police officers
[25:01.380 --> 25:05.140]  abuse their cars their cars, you know, they drive them up curbs, you know, they're
[25:05.780 --> 25:09.940]  They're you know, they're in action. And then once the police are like, oh my god, they're in action
[25:09.940 --> 25:14.100]  And then once the police are like, wow, this isn't even good enough to use for a police cruiser anymore
[25:14.180 --> 25:20.020]  Then they just sell them to a cab company in philly and they're just really again. This is a total white wine
[25:20.100 --> 25:23.220]  This is absolutely coming from a position of privilege
[25:23.780 --> 25:30.820]  Um, but the the cap most of the cabs in philly, they're just gross. They're just grossed as beer. They don't smell good. Um,
[25:31.940 --> 25:33.860]  The air conditioning is a lot of them
[25:33.940 --> 25:38.100]  Especially the crown fix and then the crown fix are they're there because they're not making them anymore
[25:38.100 --> 25:41.220]  And so slowly but surely they're getting off the roads and they're being replaced
[25:41.780 --> 25:43.620]  by
[25:43.620 --> 25:47.620]  Newer cars, um, but like the crown fix they all have the um
[25:48.580 --> 25:50.580]  the safety style
[25:50.580 --> 25:55.620]  Divider between you and the the cab driver, you know with plexiglass and most of them
[25:55.700 --> 26:00.100]  There's just like this gross. I swear to god like a two-inch diameter tube
[26:00.580 --> 26:05.620]  Down on the floor coming from the front which is where the heater air conditioning gets sent to the back
[26:05.620 --> 26:06.900]  Yeah
[26:06.900 --> 26:10.980]  Oh, that's great. I guess at first I thought you were going that's where sort of the uh,
[26:11.220 --> 26:15.540]  The the driver discharges, uh when they've been driving for a long time, so that's slightly better than that
[26:15.620 --> 26:17.620]  But yeah, it's slightly better. It's definitely better
[26:18.420 --> 26:21.460]  Um, but yeah, like imagine like an accordion style
[26:22.260 --> 26:24.260]  Tube, you know like a plastic tube like this
[26:24.420 --> 26:27.380]  So, you know those ones that kids can like wave around and they make like a funny noise
[26:27.460 --> 26:30.100]  It's like that type of tube and it's just there on the floor
[26:30.580 --> 26:34.260]  And that's that's where your air conditioning comes from it's really they did it to them
[26:34.260 --> 26:37.780]  So and so that used to be the situation too with cabs in san francisco for sure
[26:37.780 --> 26:40.660]  They were disgusting like they're ridiculous cars. Um,
[26:41.220 --> 26:44.740]  I've noticed the only time they ever take a cab anymore in san francisco
[26:44.740 --> 26:46.900]  I've taken a few coming back from the airport
[26:47.140 --> 26:47.620]  um
[26:47.620 --> 26:50.420]  Just because obviously a lot of cities as i'm sure you know
[26:50.500 --> 26:55.380]  To have these weird rules around like where an uber lift can pick you up and like, you know
[26:55.540 --> 26:59.060]  Sort of the it takes sometimes longer to wait because of that as a result
[26:59.380 --> 27:00.180]  So if i'm in a hurry
[27:00.180 --> 27:04.900]  i'll just hop in a cab and um, so i've been in a few recently coming back from places and
[27:05.620 --> 27:09.860]  Uh, the cabs are like night and day better than they were those eight years ago
[27:09.940 --> 27:17.380]  I mean, it's it's the case of just the existence of uber lift and everything else has has caused them to has forced them to
[27:17.940 --> 27:22.580]  Uh to up their game, which means no longer accordion tubes of heat
[27:23.060 --> 27:28.900]  Uh, and of course they all now have you know, sort of at first none of them would take credit card in san francisco
[27:28.900 --> 27:34.500]  It drove me insane now. They all seem to um as a result of this but um,
[27:35.140 --> 27:38.580]  Yeah, things like that and you can summon a few from apps now
[27:38.660 --> 27:45.540]  It seems like and and whatnot. So it has uh risen all risen the tide has risen for all boats, but uh still
[27:45.780 --> 27:48.500]  Yeah, took him took that case for it to happen
[27:49.620 --> 27:54.980]  All right, let's hold that thought because i'll come back to it. Um, I don't want to talk about apple and
[27:54.980 --> 27:59.620]  Where the rise of the self-driving cars might play into apple's car ambitions, but i'm going to take a break
[28:00.260 --> 28:06.100]  And thank our first sponsor. It is wealthfront wealthfront is an automated investment service
[28:06.660 --> 28:10.820]  That holds over three billion dollars in client assets in plain english

[28:50.260 --> 28:57.540]  Even their clients who have larger investments large investments typically start with a small amount
[28:58.180 --> 29:02.580]  Just to see what it's like just to double check don't take my word for it as a guy reading a podcast ad
[29:02.820 --> 29:07.940]  Just you know put 500 or a thousand dollars in see how it works. See how easy the website is, etc
[29:08.420 --> 29:14.260]  And then put your quote-unquote real money in but you can start with just 500 bucks and up to
[29:14.260 --> 29:20.580]  $10,000 is managed for free. Totally free
[29:20.580 --> 29:24.260]  But if you follow the URL I have for you, which is wealthfront.com
[29:25.060 --> 29:29.300]  The talk show you get up to fifteen thousand dollars managed for free
[29:30.740 --> 29:35.780]  Investors with larger accounts over fifteen thousand dollars love wealthfront because
[29:36.740 --> 29:40.020]  They have incredibly valuable investment services
[29:40.020 --> 29:44.820]  They do things like something called tax loss harvesting long story short
[29:44.820 --> 29:49.060]  It just minimizes the amount of taxes. You have to pay strategically on your investment
[29:50.580 --> 29:57.860]  And the fees are incredibly low their client fee is just one quarter of one percent and that's only
[29:58.420 --> 30:02.980]  On the money you put in the account over ten thousand dollars, but it's over fifteen thousand dollars

[30:30.420 --> 30:32.420]  So I would say this is one of the most
[30:32.420 --> 30:38.820]  Frequent emails I get on a weekly basis from readers of of daring fireball or listeners of this show
[30:39.380 --> 30:42.420]  Is just readers just saying hey, hey, john
[30:43.860 --> 30:45.860]  Idea
[30:45.860 --> 30:52.100]  What if apple's car project isn't about a car that they're going to sell what if it's uh, like a self-driving car service?
[30:53.300 --> 30:57.540]  And I I can't tell you I I mean literally I get two or three emails like that a week
[30:57.540 --> 31:03.140]  And my answer is if I if I answer the email I a lot of times I don't have time to answer emails
[31:03.140 --> 31:05.140]  I'm, sorry about that. But my answer is
[31:05.780 --> 31:07.780]  Maybe I I don't know
[31:08.340 --> 31:15.860]  It's it's possible. I mean my only thing about that though. Is that apple traditionally is a company that at its core makes
[31:16.720 --> 31:18.720]  objects
[31:18.740 --> 31:24.260]  That are beautiful that are well designed that have like a a a sexiness to them
[31:24.260 --> 31:30.340]  And then they sell them to people who want nice things at a premium price. That's just what apple does. So
[31:31.380 --> 31:37.460]  Common sense would tell me that it just by history that if apple's making a car they're making a car that they plan to sell at
[31:37.460 --> 31:40.740]  A uh at a high profit. Yeah, I mean so
[31:41.380 --> 31:48.260]  That's been a thing that that's been bandied about I guess since since the whole rumors of apple car started
[31:48.740 --> 31:50.740]  first and foremost it was
[31:50.740 --> 31:54.180]  uh
[31:54.180 --> 31:58.660]  Was it going to be an electric car and it seems like I mean that's a that seems like a for sure thing, right?
[31:58.660 --> 32:03.860]  There's no chance that apple makes a uh, you know an old gas guzzler type car
[32:04.580 --> 32:09.460]  I I would say of yeah, I would say of all the maybes and who the hell knows what they're planning with cars
[32:09.460 --> 32:12.180]  That's the one thing I would I would say is 100 a lot
[32:12.180 --> 32:19.140]  Yeah, because it's it's so off their brand at this point right where they're so committed with environments and everything, right?
[32:19.140 --> 32:25.700]  Like right. Yeah, they're so committed to the environment. I mean here in I bet it's the same everywhere but here in philly
[32:26.740 --> 32:33.460]  Uh, the front of the store right now says, uh, this store is runs on 100% renewable. I saw that exact same thing the other day
[32:33.540 --> 32:36.660]  Yep, there's there's no way
[32:37.860 --> 32:40.820]  You could sell a device that runs on gasoline
[32:41.460 --> 32:47.220]  Inside a store that says the store runs on 100% renewable energy. You just can't it's off the brand
[32:47.220 --> 32:52.020]  It's off their brand. So I just clearly they're not I don't even think they're they're looking at maybe yeah
[32:52.020 --> 32:54.500]  maybe in like 10 years they'll have the campaign like, you know, we
[32:55.220 --> 33:01.220]  You know, we really are upset that global warming has slowed to the level. Um, you know of sustainability
[33:01.220 --> 33:06.660]  So we're really amping it up. We want to want to get get that back on track. Uh, the world is becoming too cold
[33:07.220 --> 33:08.020]  um
[33:08.020 --> 33:10.020]  and so yeah, uh
[33:10.020 --> 33:16.100]  So that I do wonder like I and I also think I mean I would I would guess that that also rules out a hybrid
[33:16.100 --> 33:20.500]  Um, you know, they could do something like that, I guess but I would imagine that they just we're in this
[33:20.660 --> 33:24.500]  We're at the place now with with where tesla is at or it would make no sense
[33:24.500 --> 33:27.540]  I think to even do a hybrid approach. It has to be all electric, right?
[33:28.820 --> 33:33.460]  I think so. I I think even and I just think they can't get they just can't get near I think
[33:34.980 --> 33:41.940]  I think branding wise is why i'm certain that they just can't get near gasoline, but I think just putting on my you know
[33:41.940 --> 33:48.420]  Predicting the future hat. Uh, I I just think that's on the way out. I think that hybrids were obviously a stop grab
[33:48.740 --> 33:51.780]  And you know, maybe a necessary one. I'm not even saying that they weren't, you know
[33:52.420 --> 33:55.140]  That the hybrids are on a road aren't doing a good job
[33:55.140 --> 33:58.420]  But it clearly doesn't seem like that's where the puck is going
[33:58.580 --> 34:05.380]  So the other point of would apple just do this as sort of a service type thing is an interesting question
[34:05.380 --> 34:08.420]  um, I mean i'm with you that I
[34:08.420 --> 34:13.700]  It just doesn't seem like it's it's what they do that they would they would do something like that
[34:13.700 --> 34:16.260]  It is interesting to think about if they're you know
[34:16.260 --> 34:21.620]  If they're sort of looking at the big level picture of what everyone else is looking at like with with regards to the quote-unquote
[34:21.620 --> 34:27.300]  Doom of apple, you know that they can't find they can't find a business. That's um, that's more interesting than the iphone
[34:28.180 --> 34:33.940]  Do they start to really think outside the box and as they they start to go down the path more of services? I mean
[34:33.940 --> 34:40.900]  Maybe there's a chance that uh, you know, they realize that this beyond just selling a car themselves
[34:40.900 --> 34:46.820]  Maybe it's more interesting to have a service that's you know, potentially a more stable source of of
[34:47.460 --> 34:48.900]  ongoing revenue
[34:48.900 --> 34:54.180]  Uh, maybe but I don't I mean, I don't think that that's the case, but that's the only like argument I could make
[34:54.820 --> 34:57.300]  As to why they would do something like that. Um
[34:58.180 --> 35:01.380]  I do think the self-driving question itself is interesting
[35:01.380 --> 35:09.940]  It also would seem to me that that's what uh, they would likely be going after versus having it just be full-on electric
[35:09.940 --> 35:11.220]  But I don't know about that
[35:11.220 --> 35:17.860]  It's possible that they're doing like a a two-pronged approach one an electric car that you can drive yourself like tesla
[35:18.340 --> 35:22.260]  To the fully self-driving one or some sort of hybrid as you know
[35:22.260 --> 35:25.540]  Like sort of a lot of the teslas now are rolling out these like software updates to do
[35:25.940 --> 35:29.860]  Like autonomous driving in some capacity like when it's on the freeway and then like
[35:29.860 --> 35:34.180]  capacity like when it's on the freeway and whatnot. So, um, it could end up being something like that
[35:35.940 --> 35:38.420]  I I I just feel like the timeline
[35:38.980 --> 35:40.580]  Doesn't add up
[35:40.580 --> 35:46.980]  To bank on self-driving my my best guess and it just sounds so like like i'm trying to have it every way
[35:47.060 --> 35:50.260]  I'm not you know, i'm not making a firm prediction, but my guess is
[35:51.140 --> 35:57.320]  That apple is working on electric cars that they are absolutely working on self-driving technologies
[35:57.320 --> 36:00.920]  And what you know, let's say the early I think the earliest they could possibly
[36:01.640 --> 36:09.640]  Actually unveil an apple-branded car is like 20 20. So even even if there's some kind of apple
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.880]  Magic that that throwing their resources at that that that proves me wrong
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.120]  2019 I mean that just seems crazy to go from not having a car
[36:21.320 --> 36:25.720]  Other than as a secret project to actually having them on the road that you can buy 2019 seems like
[36:25.720 --> 36:27.720]  Fantasyland
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.760]  By 2020 will self-driving cars be there that you could do like the
[36:34.600 --> 36:37.880]  Not even have your hands on no, you know not even be paying attention to the road
[36:37.880 --> 36:44.520]  I just don't see that as possible and even just legally right even if the technology I think the technology is going to get there before
[36:45.320 --> 36:51.960]  The laws yeah, I mean that's that's a hundred percent for sure. Um, I mean I guess
[36:51.960 --> 36:58.680]  They could it maybe you could look at it sort of like the way, you know, like the iPhone rolled out right like there were
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.120]  Faster
[37:02.120 --> 37:08.840]  3g services at the time right, but they rolled out without 3g and so like maybe it is still the case even if there was
[37:09.400 --> 37:16.120]  Self-driving cars out on the road and like or you know, say 75 self-driving. It's like it could be self-driving beyond like a few
[37:17.240 --> 37:19.240]  You know areas where it's not
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.840]  It's possible that Apple would just roll out. It is not, you know, not
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.520]  Advertised or whatever as as self-driving because they don't feel like it's a good enough experience yet
[37:28.520 --> 37:31.560]  and that's that I could see that, you know that world where it's like
[37:32.360 --> 37:39.720]  You know, maybe maybe Google is something out there. Maybe you were maybe Tesla and they're they're billing them more as self-driving
[37:39.720 --> 37:46.920]  But Apple is a bit more sort of cautious on that front and and and really waiting for it to be like a fully self-driving thing
[37:46.920 --> 37:49.480]  Before they they go down that road
[37:49.480 --> 37:56.200]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think is that they're they're planning for that full steam ahead, but that they are also planning
[37:56.760 --> 37:59.000]  I'm guessing to ship a car before that's ready
[37:59.000 --> 38:07.400]  Yeah, and that exactly, you know the analogy to 3g and LTE but 3g is the perfect example because they're 3g was actually there were 3g phones
[38:07.800 --> 38:13.560]  It's actually one of the you know, if you go back and look at the claim chowder of the people who who panned the original iPhone
[38:13.560 --> 38:20.200]  They'd be like, it's not even 3g, you know, it's right. I think it's that sort of thing where they're like look for practical purposes
[38:20.200 --> 38:25.160]  We're gonna go with edge for this one and you know, we'll pick up 3g in a year
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.240]  But do you think that they would do sort of like what Tesla has done so they roll out one high-end
[38:31.240 --> 38:36.120]  You know Tesla started with the Roadster which is like a super high-end super fancy sports car, right?
[38:36.120 --> 38:56.120]  And then and Elon Musk in that in that great blog post many years ago laid out exactly what they were gonna do and what they're now pulling off, right, that they would then roll out a cheaper version and then sort of a SUV type version and then like the cheapest version, you know, sort of the mass market version
[38:56.120 --> 39:10.360]  Do you think Apple would take that approach something akin to that where they do sort of one at a time versus rolling out like say two models, you know, like a high-end version and then more like the sedan for for regular folks or something
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.840]  Prior to Apple watch I would have said one for sure because that's how Apple always do things, right? There's one iPhone
[39:16.840 --> 39:33.720]  There's one iPad here it is. This is the iPad and only years down the road. Are there things like iPad pros and iPad minis and you know low-end models with two-year-old systems on a chip and high-end models with the latest and greatest only years down the road
[39:33.720 --> 39:55.720]  But without after Apple watch, I think I don't know. I don't I don't know that, you know, maybe Apple why I keep thinking that maybe Apple watch is not that it was that not that the only reason they did it was as a test for the car but that it it lays out the formula for the car where they might do three right Apple car sport, right?
[39:55.720 --> 40:07.720]  $20,000 $25,000 or something like that $30,000 Apple car $50,000 and the Apple car addition, you know for $100,000
[40:07.720 --> 40:17.720]  And I'm laughing but part of the reason I say that is that I know that there's enough, you know executives at Apple. I've been to the Apple parking lot
[40:17.720 --> 40:29.720]  There are a lot of really nice cars in in the infinite loop parking lot people who work at Apple have nice cars. It's it's almost like I've and we know like Johnny I've and and
[40:29.720 --> 40:52.720]  Phil Schiller and who else? Eddie Q. Right. He's on the board of Lamborghini, I think. Yeah. Yeah. So they're obviously car guys. They're they like their fancy car. Right? Yeah. So, you know, you know, how do you know, if they're already car guys who like exotic cars, how does Apple get into it without making an exotic car?
[40:52.720 --> 41:10.720]  Well, and to tie it back to what we were talking about earlier, you know, we were talking about in the context of Uber, like not needing to own a car anymore. Like, if we're talking about let's say it's it's 2020. So it's, you know, a little less than four years to say it's four years from now, four or five years from now.
[41:10.720 --> 41:39.720]  And more people are in the space of what, you know, sort of you and your wife were debating and me and my wife now live in, in, let's just say in urban areas, at least in city areas, that they feel like they don't need to own a car. Like, is it weird for Apple to be making a car that they would potentially be selling for whatever $50,000 in a world where decreasing number of people are buying cars?
[41:39.720 --> 41:58.720]  That's a great question. That's part of why I find this whole topic fascinating because there's so many trends that are moving, right? There's the, we've talked about them, but there's the, you know, gas to electric, there's the self driving is coming.
[41:58.720 --> 42:15.720]  There's and then like, there's this whole shared, you know, ride sharing thing where people just don't own cars period. I think, my guess is that, okay, fewer and fewer people are buying cars, but Apple can enter. And if you're going to buy a car, they're going to, they're going to have a compelling
[42:15.720 --> 42:44.720]  car. You know, that it's easy to say, sure, fewer people are buying cars, but it's, you know, people also said fewer people are buying watches. Fewer people wear a watch than ever before. That's true. That's a good point. Because I was going to, I was going to say like PCs, fewer people are buying PCs, right? But then Mac is still doing well, relatively speaking, but would they enter that world now, you know, knowing it's an overall shrinking world. And that's not to say they wouldn't, but it's, it's a calculation you have to make.
[42:44.720 --> 43:07.720]  Yeah, I totally, I think so. But I just think that the market for cars is so big, that so many, you know, there are so many car companies and so many, you know, it's just so much money in the industry overall, that even if it shrinks, you know, significantly, that Apple can take a sizable chunk of the profitable end of that market, and it still is huge.
[43:07.720 --> 43:36.720]  Right. And it's a potential, you know, talking, going back to the, what is the next iPhone? It's one of the potential things that could actually match the iPhone. Like, I think we're all, I think everyone, I would assume you're in agreement now, like, and always have been, but like, that even at the, the best case scenario for Apple Watch, it cannot match what the iPhone did just because of the whole subsidy model, you know, and the way that the world just worked back then.
[43:36.720 --> 43:46.720]  And the watch has nothing like that. Even if Apple sells more of them overall, they're not going to make as much money off of it because it's just a different business.
[43:46.720 --> 44:02.720]  Right. There's no way, even no matter how popular Apple Watch becomes, it's not going to sell in the quantity that iPhone does. And each one they do sell is going to sell for at least half the price, if not even less than half the price of the iPhone today.
[44:02.720 --> 44:03.720]  Right.
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.720]  Because almost everybody gets the sport model.
[44:05.720 --> 44:06.720]  Right.
[44:06.720 --> 44:07.720]  Which is a mistake I made.
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.720]  So it's a lower price product. It's a lower price. What, you did buy a sport?
[44:11.720 --> 44:24.720]  No, I should have bought a sport. I bought the regular Apple Watch, not the edition. I bought the regular one and I'm just like, I don't know why I did that. I did that because I thought it would be slightly different or whatever, but it definitely should have gotten the sport. Anyway, that's an aside.
[44:24.720 --> 44:43.720]  Yeah. Well, I've mentioned, I'm actually wearing it today. I have the regular one with the space black and I do like a link style bracelet and it is a wonderful bracelet and it's very comfortable. But I really think that the sport models are superior just because the Taptic engine works better.
[44:43.720 --> 44:50.720]  Yeah. And wasn't it supposed to have a slightly better screen? I remember like something slightly better maybe?
[44:50.720 --> 44:58.720]  The display isn't any better, but the surface of the display on the regular Apple Watch is sapphire.
[44:58.720 --> 44:59.720]  That's right.
[44:59.720 --> 45:04.720]  And the other one is whatever, ion-coated glass. So it does pick up fine scratches.
[45:04.720 --> 45:05.720]  Yeah, got it.
[45:05.720 --> 45:17.720]  But I've looked at my sons. My son has had an Apple Watch from I guess around a year and wears it a lot. He's a 12-year-old kid and it's not like he's taking good care of it.
[45:17.720 --> 45:25.720]  I've looked at the screen and it does have fine scratches, but it's no different than any other non-sapphire coated watch that I've worn.
[45:25.720 --> 45:37.720]  And when you're actually looking at the display head on the scratches, you can't see them. You have to do the thing where you turn the display off and kind of find a glaring light source to sort of spot the scratches.
[45:37.720 --> 45:57.720]  So yeah, most people are buying the cheaper version. High-end cars are one of the few things that could produce the types of revenues that would match iPhone potentially at a massive scale.
[45:57.720 --> 46:12.720]  Or at least be like the same class of planet. So maybe the iPhone is still Jupiter, but the car potentially is another gas giant. Could be like Neptune or something like that.
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.720]  As opposed to the Apple Watch, which is really just like another Venus or Earth or Mars or something.
[46:17.720 --> 46:18.720]  Yes.
[46:18.720 --> 46:38.720]  It's a planet. It's not Pluto. It's a real planet. Come on, you can't compare it to Jupiter. But the car could be just because the car could easily sell for $30,000. Quite frankly, it's Apple, so it's probably more.
[46:38.720 --> 46:53.720]  So I know you want to talk about the Peter Thiel thing, too, as well. And we can get to that. But while we're still on the topic of Apple, the one thing that I've been thinking about a lot recently is the whole Alexa and the rumors now.
[46:53.720 --> 47:05.720]  I think the information had the report the other day that Apple would be working on a potential Echo competitor. And of course, Google announced their home thing at IO, which is the Echo competitor.
[47:05.720 --> 47:17.720]  I'm interested in your take on that. I think at a high level, we went back and forth on Twitter a little bit one night. And I think you know my perspective on it, which is that the...
[47:17.720 --> 47:29.720]  Well, hold your thought. Because that was already in my list of topics I want to talk to you about. And we could do a whole segment on it. So let me take a break and thank another sponsor. Thank our good friends at Audible.

[48:59.720 --> 49:13.720]  Quickly, before we go into Alexa and whatnot, you brought up Bill Simmons' podcast earlier. I was always curious if you ever thought about doing what he does when he does his sponsor reads and plays, I think he plays a Tupac song or whatever in the background.
[49:13.720 --> 49:22.720]  But do you think about a way to sort of, I don't know, personate it differently than the rest of the show?
[49:22.720 --> 49:37.720]  I have, it's funny, it's very funny that you would bring that up because two reasons that I have thought about that is A, Bill Simmons' podcast, which now with this whole ringer thing, there's more of them and I've been listening to them and I've noticed that.
[49:37.720 --> 49:55.720]  And I like it. I really like his reads too. I think he does a great job at it. It makes me want to up my game on making sure that the reads are engaging. That's really one of the things I feel like when I do this show, I'm just having fun talking to people who I like talking to.
[49:55.720 --> 50:07.720]  And my job is doing the sponsor reads in a way that makes people not want to skip them. And how can I do that? What would it take for me if I were listening to the talk show to not want to skip this ad?
[50:07.720 --> 50:29.720]  And I never skip Bill Simmons', so I really, and it inspires me, but I've noticed that he plays the music behind it. And then the gang on Accidental Tech Podcast has started, it's almost like an in-joke, where they haven't been playing music behind the reads, but they've added little sounds to start it and close them.
[50:29.720 --> 50:37.720]  Okay, so to give people an indication of like, this is now the sponsored break.
[50:37.720 --> 50:58.720]  Ding, ding, ding. And then it's the sponsoring and then when it's over, it's like dun, dun, dun. And then it's like you're back. And I have to mention, because Marco Arment on ATP said that his inspiration for starting to do that when he edits the show is the absolutely great podcast, which I've mentioned before, Hello, Internet, with CGP Grace.
[50:58.720 --> 51:03.720]  CGP Grace and the other guy.
[51:03.720 --> 51:22.720]  When, so I've listened to Simmons' podcast for a long time, you know, dating back well to like the earlier, probably near when he started it at ESPN. And I think, because originally they would play, I think they would play like canned ads, and they still do this on many ESPN podcasts.
[51:22.720 --> 51:40.720]  And so he slowly evolved into more of the reads that you hear now and certainly what you do. And one of the reasons why I think like you like him and I like him too, is because he was so bad at it at first, like, it's almost like when someone told him that, you know,
[51:40.720 --> 51:53.720]  well, you got to do, you got to like actually talk about it. That's what resonates with sort of podcast listeners. And so, you know, if you're just like, you know, having a conversation, then all of a sudden dive into a spiel about, you know, whatever the advertiser is doing.
[51:53.720 --> 52:09.720]  It comes across much better than sort of a canned recording of whatever the advertiser is saying. And so, at first he was so bad at it. And I think he's evolved over time and almost like plays on like being bad at it, because it's not so bad anymore.
[52:09.720 --> 52:22.720]  But it's like, it's just natural, right? It's like the way that he would talk about it. And I think you, honestly, I think you do a good job of it as well. But the only thing is his just feels like more raw. That's, that's what it is.
[52:22.720 --> 52:49.720]  Yeah. Yeah. I have to add, it's Brady Haran is the other co host of Hello, Internet. But they do, they do the same thing with the bumper sounds. I don't know, I have to think about it. I'm not setting my ways on this. Okay, so Siri, so that so the information had a scoop the other day that Apple is planning both a Siri API for developers to extend Siri.
[52:49.720 --> 52:58.720]  And an Echo like standalone device, which is like the also competitive with the upcoming Google Home.
[52:58.720 --> 53:01.720]  Right.
[53:01.720 --> 53:14.720]  So I have had a Amazon Echo, I always get confused whether I should call it Alexa or Echo. Alexa is the persona, obviously.
[53:14.720 --> 53:21.720]  But it's also how you address it. You say, right, it's a weird branding issue.
[53:21.720 --> 53:34.720]  I think they should just call it Alexa, honestly. But anyway, so I've had one for several months now, about a quarter. And you definitely use it daily when I'm home, unless I'm on the road, of course.
[53:34.720 --> 53:45.720]  And I'm slowly but surely finding new use cases for it. You know, it started as sort of novelty, of course, just you know, what's the weather and whatever.
[53:45.720 --> 54:03.720]  Now I use it almost daily to to sort of read me the latest news, which is sort of another obvious one. But it's sort of a nice way just to when you when you get up in the morning, just like Alexa, what's latest news and it'll just start doing it like there's no there's no phone to unlock there's no button to push.
[54:03.720 --> 54:20.720]  You just speak out loud. That's what you want. My wife uses it all the time when she's cooking to say and it's like a constant thing. It's almost like a like a an orchestrated event of her cooking and with the Alexa in the kitchen saying like Alexa set a timer for two minutes.
[54:20.720 --> 54:33.720]  Then two minutes goes by it goes off Alexa off Alexa set a timer for five minutes. And it's like this whole thing that just goes on every night that she's cooking and it's it's really a good device.
[54:33.720 --> 54:49.720]  And I was skeptical of it when I first heard about it because it seemed ridiculous, right? It's a standalone expensive thing that does a lot of what you can already do with Siri and Cortana and you know what Google Now and some of the other things.
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.720]  But in using it, it's useful.
[54:54.720 --> 55:09.720]  Yeah, and there's a certain like the the kitchen scenario that cooking and cooking in the kitchen scenario is almost ideal for I have one too. I just got it like three weeks ago and and I'm not using it that much.
[55:09.720 --> 55:13.720]  But I think one of the reasons do you have any of the smart home stuff?
[55:13.720 --> 55:23.720]  Like bulbs and stuff like that. I don't have anything like that. Yeah, not that I think we do have like one light bulb thing, but not that we use and we don't have like a nest or anything like that currently installed.
[55:23.720 --> 55:38.720]  Right, but, but for the cooking stuff, so I know people, you know, people definitely use their phones for stuff like that. And I know, definitely people use like a smartwatch like your Apple Watch or whatever the smartwatch to do that stuff too.
[55:38.720 --> 56:00.720]  But the thing with echo is it's completely hands free, so you don't have to push a button on the watch or fish your phone out of the pocket or on, you know, I know your phone I guess if you know if you have a new iPhone you could if you have it plugged in, you can try the hey, you know, the name of I try to avoid it so we don't have to beep it but
[56:00.720 --> 56:12.720]  Siri. But you know it works even if not plugged in like this is a big thing that people. Oh yeah, it does now that's that's the thing that you have to have a new one for now that right that's a new feature right if you have like the iPhone success.
[56:12.720 --> 56:32.720]  It just seems though that echo is more reliable like you can really count on it. Yeah, it's to get to make sure that you that it, it's giving you the timer that you just told, I still want I go back and forth on this but told her to set right right.
[56:32.720 --> 56:42.720]  I struggle I really struggle with the pronoun for these things I tend to use her with Siri, and it's even weirder because I know that in some countries it defaults to a male voice. That's right, yeah.
[56:42.720 --> 57:02.720]  So do you should use it, and the whole. It's a very strange dynamic that I think will never be fully sorted out. But yeah, so you bring up like the, I don't, I even hesitate hesitate to call it accuracy because I'm not 100% sure that like Alexa is more
[57:02.720 --> 57:20.720]  accurate than say Siri. It seems that way, but it's just more reliable right like, and I think it's because it's a combination of things but one of the things is that, you know, when you set up Siri, you have to set it up by like saying, hey, I also don't want to set off all my devices.
[57:20.720 --> 57:37.720]  You know the word. Hey, she who shall not be named. And so you have to do that a few times right and so it's like Apple, obviously thought that that's like a good way to make it sort of personalized to you and so someone else can't necessarily set it off.
[57:37.720 --> 57:54.720]  But that is also a limiting factor it seems like and makes it less reliable. And so, Amazon just deciding not to do it that way and just leaving it open so anyone can trigger it, you know, ends up being I think a smarter implementation at least for now of how to do that.
[57:54.720 --> 58:13.720]  Yeah, and anecdotally, I've read this, and I've had since I've started talking about this, and you know, heard from people on Twitter and email sending me that a lot of guys heard it numerous times that people with young kids, their kids can use the echo really reliably
[58:13.720 --> 58:31.720]  and they have no luck at all with Siri Siri really doesn't series speech recognition really isn't good with kids and it's it's funny because it's like you know it you know that kids don't speak as I don't even know what the word is are they're not as articulate
[58:31.720 --> 58:45.720]  they don't enunciate as crisply as adults. It's like but you don't you tend to think of it as well that's just how kids talk, but it's it's seemingly from a speech recognition standpoint it's they're just harder to understand, whereas humans are so good that
[58:45.720 --> 58:59.720]  we don't really think of kids as being harder to understand we just think of them as sounding as kids, because our natural linguistic abilities are so good that we, we just blow right through the way that they mispronounce words.
[58:59.720 --> 59:06.720]  And so the kids thing is interesting also because before I got a echo everyone.
[59:06.720 --> 59:16.720]  One of the main themes that kept coming up is like kids love it, and I don't have kids, you have a son like just your son use it like, you know, not really he's, he's, but he.
[59:16.720 --> 59:23.720]  He kind of thinks it's pointless, because, but there's nothing he really wants to know from it that we have hooked up.
[59:23.720 --> 59:37.720]  We did have fun as the family the one, one or two nights playing music and calling out you know and then it's, it's funny because it's like if there's a song on and any one of the three of us doesn't like it, you can tell Alexa to stop and play something else.
[59:37.720 --> 59:53.720]  Yeah, and I think that that's, I think that's been stated I don't know if it's by Amazon or not that that's one of the main use cases, of course, is playing, playing the music, and it's, um, yeah it's pretty, it's a seamless way to you know do.
[59:53.720 --> 59:58.720]  Hey, Alexa said hey, you don't have to say hey of course, Alexa play.
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:11.720]  You know, this, this station on Pandora or whatever, I think you can hook up obviously Amazon music. You can hook up Pandora. You can't hook up Apple music right now right so.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:27.720]  So there's, I don't expect Apple to get on that quickly. Yeah, no, I don't either. But, so that's one big use case. So the other thing is, it obviously has a decent speaker but it's not great, it's not like a Sonos or something like that.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:42.720]  And you can hook up, because we also got the dot thing you know the dot is a smaller one. As an aside, the one thing I loved about that rollout was the fact that in order to first order a dot you actually had to order it through the echo you had to say like Alexa
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:57.720]  order me a dot and it knew what it knew what it was I mean my wife actually did it, and within three minutes or whatever it confirms and so we had a, we had a dot ordered and come in shipping to our house and we got it and it worked beautifully and you couldn't order it on the website,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:08.720]  at least at the time when they when they first sort of rolled that out so that was that was sort of fascinating. I don't think you can now, I mean I just searched Amazon for echo I don't see it echo dot, let me see.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  So did you know they do have it, you can get it you can get echo dot for $89 on Amazon.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.720]  Do you know it's hilarious. So I just was giving that whole spiel.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:37.720]  And I swear to God I just triggered Alexa and she's now playing music in my bedroom so I'm in my office right now, one, one room down from the bedroom. I all of a sudden heard this music and I'm like is my wife home did she just start playing music,
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:50.720]  because I thought I heard a voice. It was Alexa, and it was Alexa saying now playing whatever. And so there's just music playing in the bedroom right now. I stand corrected so there is a web page on Amazon for the echo dot, but it says it's available exclusively
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:02:05.720]  from Alexa echo dot is available in limited quantities and exclusively for prime members through Alexa voice shopping. So I think that that's that's ingenious because it obviously makes it so that first and foremost only sort of quote unquote hardcore users
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:19.720]  are going to, to be able to get it and get it that way and people who already understand right the, they have to have Alexa, an echo sorry to be able to do it so it doesn't need like, you know, some sort of new learning curve all of a sudden because you should
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.720]  already know how to use it based on that. Yeah.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:35.720]  I think the music playing is clearly you know the, the, and when this rumor from the information came out that Apple's has a device like this in the works and that they've been working on it for quite a while.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:46.720]  A bunch of people so well why why have my iPhone with me everywhere I go, you know, if I'm going to use Siri Why do I need, why would the world I want another device. I don't know what else they have planned for it.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:03:01.720]  I don't know what other home integration you know HomeKit type features they might have in mind for what kind of a hub it might be for your entire home, but the speaker alone makes sense for Apple to do just because music is still such a big part of what
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720]  they want to be known for.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:17.720]  Yep. Yeah, and I'm sort of surprised that, you know, they weren't, I know that, you know, they're, they're almost never the first mover in these types of things but I'm sort of surprised that some sort of combination of things didn't lead them down this
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:35.720]  path earlier, whether it be the Airport Express or Apple TV as like a basically the way to do this like there were all those rumors remember that Apple TV was going to be the hub of their, of their whole home initiative, and maybe that still ends up being the
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:43.720]  case but like that was the whole thing about like why is it running iOS and of course apps but also maybe you know the the HomeKit stuff.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  And, yeah, I'm sort of just a little surprised that they didn't make a all in one type device, and especially like knowing, you know, the popularity of things like Sonos, and they're obviously they had to work with Sonos to get Apple Music is one of the
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.720]  first things on there.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:13.720]  And maybe it was I think you made the joke the other day, maybe it was the iPod Hi Fi thing that sort of dissuaded them from doing that, because that was obviously a disaster.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.720]  That's what I want him to call it I want him to call it.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  Siri had the trademark. Yeah.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.720]  But yeah, it seems like,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:37.720]  I think the way someone was saying this the other day on Twitter, that it's great that we have like Alexa, and, and it's cool that you can sort of hook it up to Sonos it's a pain honestly because you have to do it through like the back of the device
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.720]  and through a cable.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:50.720]  It's not it's not seamless at all. And now we have things like Euro, and like you know the new the newfangled routers that are out, like it seems like someone should combine all of that into one thing, right.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.720]  Yes, I think so.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:05:10.720]  But you run into I've thought about this right you. It's like, it's it seems like a big, a big but like just thinking about my house now like the cable comes in, in the living room.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:29.720]  And it's sort of like that's where the, the router needs to be. I mean, I guess I could, you know, I'd have to like wire the house with internet or ethernet or something, or get the cable company to come out and put another cable connector somewhere else,
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.720]  if I wanted it to be in the kitchen.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:45.720]  Because that's well music to play you know what I mean, it's like I don't know I'm not quite sure. I yeah I understand. Yeah, so that's like a, that's one issue but sort of, I don't know if you've had a chance to play around with like things like the Euro
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:53.720]  and there's some other ones coming out that are you know these these newfangled routers that that allow you to better spread internet over your entire house.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:06:05.720]  Because it's better, I have a box downstairs, that's full of Euro kit, and it's still in the box I just came the other day and I haven't had a chance to look at it so it's on my radar and I'm going to set it up, but.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.720]  Yeah, you should I mean we have we have one set up now.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:26.720]  And it's great. It's, it's surprisingly great how well it works compared to what I've previously just had a, an airport, both at extreme. And then I had like an express and I had like things like doing bridging and you know trying to get good service
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  in the bedroom and then in the office, and nothing has worked as well as this Euro thing works.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:46.720]  And so I wonder if sort of this this device things that we're talking about, if they don't do. Yeah, you have the main hub in the living room that's that's sort of connected to the still necessary for whatever reason cable modem.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  And then everything else is like a satellite version sort of like the Echo Dot right it's like a smaller version of it. So no matter what room you're in, you're, you're covered by it it's sort of like what you have with Sonos now for people who have
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.720]  access to Sonos in multiple rooms, you know they wirelessly connect to it.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:14.720]  You can do wired of course but most people I think do the wireless version. And so, so some device it's like a combination of all these things so you have the speaker.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:29.720]  You have your voice assistant type thing, and, and you have your Wi Fi all in one thing I mean, that seems like where all this should go but I would imagine it'll take a while for for someone to actually connect that all together to be able to work well.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:42.720]  Yeah, and it's just you know Apple has a very, you know, right at the forefront of Wi Fi you know I've been making base stations or whatever you want to call them, you know, the thing that great Wi Fi in your house, I mean Apple's been doing it.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  We're one of the first companies to really go public with it remember the Phil Schiller demo and he jumped onto a mattress.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:08:12.720]  It was like to prove that the iBook was getting the internet over the air, it was like heretofore unknown like Phil Schiller actually performed a stunt on stage like he like off a 10 foot high thing onto like a padded landing thing and then showed that the, that the iBook was still getting internet.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:27.720]  So Apple's been doing that for a long time. I think that at this point, it's, it just seems like it's too fiddly especially for a house compared, you know, an apartment, you know, it's easy to fill it with with your Wi Fi but you know, even here we I have it set up pretty good
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:42.720]  right now we just have the airport extreme, I don't have any of the satellite devices like I used to have. And it, you know, goes up one floor to my office and it's pretty good. And it goes up two floors to our bedroom.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:58.720]  And it's good enough good enough that it doesn't make me want to get another thing but even one floor down in our garage, it's gone. So like, it's like when you get in the car. It's like one floor down from where the router is, and you want to update something on your phone quick.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.720]  It's like sometimes you have to like, do the fiddly thing where you turn off Wi Fi, because it's so bad.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720]  Yeah.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:26.720]  Yeah, you should try the zero thing. I think you'll like Oh, I'm gonna try it. Like I told you, it's done. It's in the house. So it's it's a sure thing that I will that I will try it. Yeah. So I don't know, maybe that's that's what Apple's going with. And I can't help but think that if if the information's report is correct, that they've been working on this device for quite a while. I mean, like, according to the information years.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:50.720]  It can't, it can't just be a speaker that listens for Siri, because they that I, you know, if it's taken Apple years to do a speaker that listens for Siri, that's, that's a problem. It has to be a little bit more ambitious than that in terms of serving as some kind of, you know, hey, you don't have to buy these six different things. You can just buy this plug this thing in and then you're set.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:10:08.720]  Well, and you brought it up. I mean, the importance of music certainly to Apple and, you know, they obviously know the popularity of something like Sonos. And do you think then it would be just as predicated around being a great speaker sort of a Sonos competitor with Siri built in? Is that is that maybe what they would do?
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:29.720]  Maybe I sort of, you know, and and would they launch it as a family of devices at the beginning so that you can, you know, put them throughout your house? I mean, that seems to be the one area that and I obviously Amazon is is working on it or as a solution because they have these dot devices that are meant to be satellite devices.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:39.720]  And I know with Google Home, people asked when they announced it at IO last week, well, what if you have two of these things? And they're like, well, we're working on that. We'll get back. Right. It's a hard problem.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:11:02.720]  Yes. And the Amazon. So the dot like so in general, I think the consensus is the Echo speaker is OK. It's it's it's good enough, you know, for casual listening or whatever. And the dot one is considered to be much more subpar. It's obviously much smaller. It's just a tiny little thing. And that's why it has sort of the output to be able to hook it into a speaker. And that's what they suggest you do, actually.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:19.720]  So I wouldn't like if I were Apple, I would imagine that the way to do it is just what we were talking about, to do like a really great speaker, like a Sonos-like speaker with the Siri capability built in. And I think that would be a great device for a lot of people.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:37.720]  I don't know how much that would cost, you know, and like, do they run the risk of it being another Hi-Fi like device that's just sort of like a niche product that's that's interesting to a few people? I think not. I think it's a lot more interesting to do it now, especially with everything we just talked about with Alexa. But I don't know.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:56.720]  With the Hi-Fi, they really, it was, I mean, I know for a fact that Steve Jobs was a huge fan of the Hi-Fi. He really was. And I mean, I, you know, obviously, he's willing to, you know, you know, if it wasn't selling, it wasn't selling even if he liked it. So it wasn't like he kept it around just because he liked it, but I know he liked it.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:12.720]  And they really put, it was before I was regularly attending their press events and I was not at the at the intro event for it, but I remember reading about it and they really went all out and they set up, Jason Snell was there and he was talking about it a few weeks ago when he was on the show.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:27.720]  That they, right there in like the upstairs area where they do the press briefings at the press events above town hall, they brought in, you know, they made like an Ikea almost like where they made a whole bunch of like living rooms, you know.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:40.720]  And of course, you know, like Apple, they made them, they were really nice. You know, they made all these, they like furnished the whole place is like an apartment complex and then had, you know, individual people, you come in and it wasn't just like, hey, hit play and listen to it for seconds.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.720]  They wanted you to like relax, sit on the couch, pretend you live here and listen to this drink.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:55.720]  Right. And they really pushed like, hey, doesn't this sound amazing? Like they really, really wanted to make that like, I mean, I, I had, I didn't buy one, so I don't know.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:02.720]  I don't know how good it sounded, but Apple at least really went all out, at least in terms of marketing is pitching it as being high quality audio.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:13.720]  So I think that's one area where they could definitely get a leg up on Echo because Echo, it's good. It's not bad. It's, you know, good enough for like a speaker in your kitchen to play music, but it's not great.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:26.720]  And so that plus, so like a great speaker plus what, what, you know, you mentioned from the information report with the Siri APIs, which obviously everyone's been clamoring for since Siri came out.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:34.720]  So that plus the ability to do much more than what the Echo can do. Cause the Echo has an API obviously.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.720]  And a lot of people are playing around with it and doing some interesting things with it. Like we mentioned Uber, you know, you can call an Uber from it right now.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:56.720]  And, but it does feel like it's, it's a little bit wonky. It's a little bit, not wonky necessarily. It's just, I'm sure you've used the app. The app is awful for the Echo.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:07.720]  And it's hard to, it would be hard for anyone. Like even, it's even hard for me to figure out how exactly to find things to install and what to install and it looks god awful.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:20.720]  So Apple will obviously do a better job of that. And so it's then a question of like, is it leaps and bounds better than what Amazon can do right now if those APIs are good enough.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:41.720]  Yeah. And I really, I'm really curious what form these APIs come in, in terms of like, I can only presume that it'll be apps somehow, I guess, apps on your iPhone or your iOS device.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:51.720]  Yeah, so do you need to have it, do you need to have that app installed in order to have it be Siri ready, right?
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:15:03.720]  Well, yeah, and if it's on multiple devices, like, how does your Siri, if it's taking advantage of a third party extension, whatever you want to call it.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:15.720]  Like, let's just say, let's just, you know, we've been talking about them, let's just say Uber, right? Let's say that through an extension, you're gonna, you're gonna allow Siri to hail you an Uber.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:26.720]  Do you have to install it on all of your devices? Like, I guess you would if it's through an app, but then how would it get to the standalone device?
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:44.720]  Yeah, that's weird. It's a good question, because like, it seems like it's an either or thing, right? Like either you would need it installed on all your devices that have hooked up to your, like to your Hey Siri stuff, or you would only do it on one so it doesn't get confused.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:59.720]  Because like, say you have Uber installed on, they don't have an iPad version, but you can still obviously install it on an iPad. So say you had it on an iPad and your iPhone, and then you summoned the Uber via Siri, like, which one?
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  I guess it opens both versions. Well, I mean, it doesn't matter because on the back end, if presuming you were you were tied into the same account, the same Uber account, when you open the app, it should know they should be synced right in the back end.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:28.720]  So I guess it doesn't really matter. But there's there's like a lot of more complicated issues like the further you go down with that, like which, which version of the app that's running on which device are you summoning?
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:55.720]  Right, I it's I, so I'm, I don't know. So my guess, my best guess is to compare it to Apple Watch. And so let's say they open up this serious DK, then the Uber app on your iOS device could have the Siri extension, and then only on the iOS devices that have the latest version of the Uber app would the Siri integration work.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:11.720]  But then also, maybe you developers would be able to create like a high fi app. And just like the way that it'll say like, oh, there's an Apple Watch app that you can install.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:27.720]  That there would be like, if you have the Siri high fi, yeah, you would have a Siri high fi app on your phone. And then you'd go just like you go to the Apple Watch app to install an app on your watch, you'd go to the high fi app to install the extension on your high fi
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:53.720]  that we're getting pretty complicated, right? I see. And it's, it makes sense to me, like, that's exactly what I think is it. This makes sense to me, technically, because I can draw little arrows for all the devices. And I see, okay, so you download it to your phone, and from your phone, you can install it on your watch. And you can install it on the thing. But then it seems to me like you're doing an awful lot of fiddly system administrator type stuff with prices.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:18:04.720]  Yeah. And so is there a better like, is it just via the app? And now apps require, like, I don't know, some sort of new iCloud instance that it's that's like handling it?
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:21.720]  Right. And that's exactly the other that it's, you know, just erase everything that I just speculate about, is there going to be some kind of way that a developer would be able to have like an iCloud instance of this API? And, and, and that's a total new territory for Apple, like that's unlike
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.720]  anything I can think of that Apple's ever done.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:43.720]  Yeah. Yeah, I've not, I don't know. But it's good that they're, I think it's smart, of course, that they're playing in the space, smart that Google is as well, like, all these guys are pouring so much, so many resources into these assistance.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:58.720]  And, you know, the whole AI aspect, obviously, Marco's post about Apple and AI and stuff, you know, that they need to be able to get enough data to constantly improve these things.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:11.720]  And it's almost like table stakes, it seems like it's going to be now that you need to have the home version of whatever the assistant thing is to be able to, to keep up and remain on par with all the other competitors.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:22.720]  Yeah, one of the things I was thinking about, in light of Marco's post the other day about it is, I was trying to think, because I didn't agree with him fully.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:34.720]  It was a great post. And the ways that I disagree, it's just all, you know, it's not like, Marco's dumb. It's like, no, Marco's smart. And I actually see the logic of what he's saying, but something doesn't sit right with me.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:42.720]  And then I thought about, like, social networking. And social networking is obviously a huge part of the whole industry that we talk about.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:20:01.720]  I mean, Facebook is a giant company now and super influential. I mean, it's, you know, literally a scandal in the last few weeks, or a controversy, I should say, about whether or not Facebook is single handedly skewing political news in the US.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:20.720]  Hugely influential. Instagram is a huge success. Twitter, you know, Twitter is Twitter. I love it, but it's, you know, it is what it is. But it certainly is, I don't want to go down the route of talking about Twitter as a business.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:33.720]  Culturally, though, its influence is undeniable. I always say, like, the one thing about Twitter, it's just stunning how every time I watch TV news and somebody comes on, they tell you what their Twitter handle is.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:42.720]  Well, and if you watch ESPN at all, it's a significant percentage of ESPN via reporting, via talking about tweets. It's crazy.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:55.720]  Yeah, yeah. Twitter's influence in the sports world alone is astounding. Especially as we go down the path of the NBA playoffs and stuff. I don't know. I think, well, and now Major League Baseball has a ton of Twitter, too.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:11.720]  So no, it's just everywhere in sports. Apple has no real social networking, and they've even tried twice. They had Ping, and then last year, the, I don't even remember what it's called, the middle tab of Apple Music.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:14.720]  Right, the thing that's going away, apparently.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:32.720]  And hasn't taken off, hasn't really, you know, never gained a foothold. But so what? Apple has, in a second level way, sort of thrived on social networking because people use their iPhones to Facebook and to Instagram and to tweet.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:45.720]  And it's, you know, it's only made, the rise of social networking largely coincides with the rise of the iPhone, and it's a big part of why. I think that there's a real difference, though. I was thinking about it.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:22:00.720]  And the voice assistants aren't like that because the voice assistants, to be useful, have to be built into the system. Like, there is a Cortana app. There is, the Google app has all of the Google assistant type stuff.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:09.720]  You know, the startups that are in this space have apps. I can't remember some of their names, but, you know, like.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:14.720]  Yeah, there's like Operator. Oh, well, Viv is, yeah.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.720]  Viv will be an app.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720]  By the Siri people, yeah.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720]  Right.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720]  Yeah.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:28.720]  So you can do that, but that's, that doesn't make it, it doesn't work like that. You can't say go launch an app and then do it. It doesn't work like that. It has to be built into the system.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:36.720]  So the one outside the bounds, though, which I'd be interested in your thoughts on, then, is the Facebook Messenger one. Facebook M, it's called, right?
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:50.720]  So that, Facebook, obviously, famously does not have a phone. They run on, you know, other people's devices, but they do, by most accounts, have some of the foremost experts in AI working at Facebook.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:58.720]  But they, so like, how do you square that? Like, where do you think that they, where does that come into play? Because you think like they're going after AI.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:06.720]  They think they're going to be a leader in whatever comes of AI. And certainly these assistant things are a big part of that, at least right now.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:15.720]  And Facebook M is sort of one of the front runners right now for that. But they don't have the system level integration.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:39.720]  It's a good question. It could just be, you know, to, you know, to do the AI while you're in their apps, like, and Facebook's advantage is, and I say this as someone who doesn't use Facebook, but people, you know, part of what makes them so valuable is that, you know, people spend an awful lot of people spend an awful lot of time in Facebook.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:45.720]  So they already have them there. So they, they're, they're almost are, they almost are like their own system.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.720]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:24:00.720]  If you're already there, you're in Facebook on your phone or, you know, well, I think the phone is probably number one now. So you're in Facebook, you're on your phone, any kind of AI features that they can offer you, you're already there.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.720]  So they have the need for that.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.720]  Or that's a good way to frame it, I think.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:22.720]  It's almost like, so the browser on a, on a PC or Mac is not, you know, sort of, well, while they are baked into the system, it is a separate application that you're running all the time. Everyone's always running a browser, right?
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.720]  And that's like Facebook on the phone.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:37.720]  That's been said before, of course, but it is in that context, like basically the same thing. They even helpfully cheat and use the audio API's to make sure they're literally running on your phone all the time.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.720]  I keyed, I keyed slightly.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:53.720]  That brings to mind another one of the topics in this space that I want to talk about, and I've seen an awful lot of people bring this up. So one of the other rumors, it's separate from the information report, but there's also a rumor that has come out.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:03.720]  I know MacRumors had it. I don't know if it was their original. I think it was. I think it was their original scoop that the next version of Mac OS is going to have Siri built in.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:14.720]  Yes, and a lot of people read that and the question I got is, well, why do I have to talk to Siri? Why can't I just type like Spotlight and then therefore, well, maybe that's the answer.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:21.720]  Maybe the Spotlight feature goes away and it's replaced by Siri and you can either talk to it or type.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.720]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:37.720]  I think that that, you know, thinking about it for a few seconds just now, I think that that's probably the way they should do it. I think it's a little weird, like, Microsoft has done this too with Cortana.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:54.720]  I think it's a little weird to have those things on the desktop in the same, trying to fit them into the same context as they exist right now on mobile devices, because you just use a desktop, laptop, whatever, traditional computer differently.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:07.720]  And you're right, like a lot of it is text-based input. It's not vocal, which sort of ties back to the whole thing of why I also think Alexa is important, because there is no way to interface with it besides the voice.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:18.720]  But, you know, that's a different route to go down. But yeah, so I think that Siri as a text-based thing is interesting and that's also like going to Facebook M.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:29.720]  Right now it is mainly text-based, it's all chat-based, right? So they're doing it the opposite way of what Siri and Alexa and Cortana and...
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:36.720]  The Google thing, I guess, is a hybrid, right? Because you can talk to it or it can just be...
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:44.720]  I mean, the main interface is like to say, okay, Google, and then it loads, basically, it's doing a search query.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:57.720]  So that's, I guess, the closest thing to that, and that would be Apple, if they did do Siri for Mac OS, doing it with the text thing would be, I guess, most comparable to that?
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:10.720]  You know, there's a trick that I just learned recently, I didn't know this, but if you do invoke Siri on your iPhone and she hears you wrong,
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:18.720]  you can, on that results screen, you pull down on it and it shows you what Siri thought you said.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.720]  And if you tap on that, you can edit that text.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.720]  Oh, really? I didn't know that.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.720]  I didn't know it either. I just learned it in the last week or two from someone on Twitter in the midst of talking about all of this.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.720]  I think it was in the context of that discussion of why can't you just enter text?
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:41.720]  And in other words, why can't you invoke Siri and then pull down or something to bring up a text field and just type your query to Siri?
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.720]  Because there are, there are certain contexts where you can't.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:48.720]  Right. What if you're in a quiet area? Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720]  Huh. Yeah, I had no idea about that.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:58.720]  So you can edit text after you've made your vocal query to Siri, you can edit it as text, but you can't just type it as text.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.720]  So that's, so you should, if you want to use that feature, you just speak gibberish to Siri and then just whisper some quick gibberish.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.720]  Right. To invoke the text mode.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.720]  Anyway, interesting trick, I thought.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.720]  Yeah. And then there was the report, I think it was nine to, it was Gurman, right?
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.720]  Saying that there, or was it, or maybe it was a riff off of another report or something,
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:35.720]  but I know that 95 Mac wrote about it, that the new MacBook Pro conceivably coming out at the end of the year would have the, this like OLED strip.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:42.720]  And you know, one of the reasons why that might make sense is because then you could have a Siri button without having to have like a physical Siri button.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:55.720]  Yeah, I saw that rumor and I don't know what to make of it. It seems kind of interesting. It seems like, maybe it's also sort of like that,
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:01.720]  I don't remember if it was a Kickstarter, I think it might have been before Kickstarter, but do you remember a couple of years ago,
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.720]  there was somebody who was trying to make a keyboard.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.720]  Yes, I know what this is, that LED keyboard thing.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:15.720]  Yeah. And it was, the idea was that each key, it was a physical keyboard, but each key would be a standalone LED.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:23.720]  And so like in the quote unquote normal mode, it would be, you know, QWERTY, you know, and it would be alphabetic and have numbers.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:29.720]  But then like when you're using Photoshop, the key caps could change to all of the weird shortcuts.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:37.720]  So you, you know, you could, you know, the H key would change to, you know, whatever the H does in Photoshop.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.720]  Right.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:45.720]  Like a game could change all of the buttons to, you know, different weapons or something like that.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:56.720]  Yeah. And it's sort of, I guess, similar to on iOS when you have the virtual thing on top of the keyboard, right, where it suggests stuff.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.720]  And so it can sort of dynamically do different things.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:09.720]  Right. So that LED keyboard never really, it never came to be a realistic project, but it certainly got people excited.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:17.720]  I could see how this LED touchscreen in place of the function keys could work like that.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:32.720]  And it gets to, it's like a little bit like the Mac keyboard getting a little taste of that spiel that Steve Jobs gave at the original iPhone introduction about what to do about the buttons on a phone.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.720]  Because once you put them there, there's nothing else, you know, they're set.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.720]  And then if you come up with a new idea later, you know, that you'd like to have a different button, what do you do?
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.720]  And he goes, well, the answer is, you know, we've solved this years ago with the graphical user interface.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.720]  The answer is do it in software. So I can kind of see that.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:56.720]  And quite frankly, the idea of F1, F2, F3 keys, even it's just fiddly.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:03.720]  And I know Apple's, you know, started printing, hard-coded printing, you know, like this is volume up, this is volume down, this is brightness.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.720]  Right.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.720]  And that, you know, by default, that's what those keys do now.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:14.720]  You have to actually trigger like a system-wide preference to turn them into regular function keys.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:20.720]  Right. And I think most kids would have no idea, like F1, they would have no idea.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.720]  I have no idea. Yeah, my son, if I, I should do it when he gets home from school, I should actually see you.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.720]  Yeah, could you hit the F1 key? What, you mean the brightness down key? Which key?
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:40.720]  Do you know that, and I remember when, I still have the extended keyboard in front of me, but the Apple extended keyboard, you know, the big tank keyboard that I use,
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:48.720]  it's shipped with like a strip that went around the function keys, like a, it was like a, I don't know what you would call it,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.720]  like a, like a stencil almost that would surround the function keys.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:58.720]  And different pro apps would come, like QuarkXPress came with one.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually remember that on IBM PCs, they had a similar thing with that, yeah.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.720]  When the big, the big keys, the big pushdown keys.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:14.720]  By default, F1, I think it was just like, I think it was just like ZXCV.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.720]  So F1 was undo, F2 was cut, F3 was copy, and F4 was paste.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.720]  But this is, I mean, this is ancient Apple history. This is like stuff that worked in like 1991.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:43.720]  That's really funny, though, because that's like, you know, talking about this, this virtual LED strip that is like the original version of that, right, like software that would ship an actual physical printout that you would overlay, you know, around the keys to change their functions, to know what their function would be.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:58.720]  Yeah, so I, you know, I think this idea sounds to me like, you know, hey, this sounds like a really good idea, because then instead of having these hard-coded things that, you know, you could make that whole area flexible, you know.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:07.720]  Yeah, and yeah, then software updates, when they keep updating Mac OS and adding new things, they don't have to ship a new keyboard all of a sudden.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:08.720]  Yeah.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.720]  Mac OS flows off the tongue.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:16.720]  I really like it. This is my favorite. I'm really excited about them renaming it Mac OS. I like it.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:22.720]  But are they still going to do, they're still committed to the California thing? Is that the latest, you know?
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720]  I don't know. I have no idea.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:29.720]  Will it be Mac OS, you know, Hollywood or whatever?
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:36.720]  I think so. I think that they're committed to the California thing, because they've only done it for two years, right? Or did they do three?
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.720]  Oh, no, three, because there was Mavericks.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:43.720]  Yeah, that's right. Mavericks was first.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:52.720]  Yeah, I think they're committed to the California thing, and I think that, you know, but it's just going to be Mac OS, you know, Hollywood.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:34:01.720]  Yeah, well, I'll be glad to be done with the 10 elements of it, because it was, you know, we're at 10.11.5 now.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:14.720]  It always bothered me all along. I've never been a fan of the name Mac OS 10, and I was less of a fan when they officially changed it to OS 10 without the Mac.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:23.720]  Really, never a fan of that name. Just because, well, number one, I don't like Roman numerals. I just wrote about this. I hate Roman numerals. I just hate them.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:50.720]  They're absolutely terrible. There's arguments to be made that, I mean, I'm not being facetious here. I've seen arguments that their stupid numeral system made the Romans so bad at math that it led to the decline of the Roman Empire, because they fell to people who used a logical decimal, you know, system of indicating numerals that made math easier.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:35:01.720]  I hate it. I just don't like Roman numerals. I hate the way that it's, you know, this doesn't seem to be as big a problem anymore, but I hate it in the early years, the people who said Mac OS X.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.720]  Oh, it still happens all the time, but yeah.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:16.720]  It's not their problem. It's Apple's problem, because it looks like Mac OS X, because guess what? Normal people today don't speak in Roman numerals. If you show them an X, they say that's an X. They don't say, oh, I bet that's a 10.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:34.720]  And then as time went on, it was as though, I mean, it's 2016, so 15 years of updates to the operating system. In their numbering system, it's like they've all been minor little feature upgrades for 15 years.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:46.720]  Right. I think I read the, I don't know if you talked about this. I read this somewhere. So, you know, when they did Super Bowl 50 this past year, they did Super Bowl 50 rather than Super Bowl L or whatever.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.720]  But next year, they're going back to the Roman numerals. So it's like L-I, I think, or something like that.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:00.720]  I know. They are. It makes me want to scream, because I was so happy. I was like, you know what? I was so happy, because I thought that's brilliant.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:15.720]  50 is the nicest, roundest number they're going to get to until 100. And now, this is the way they get out of the mess they've created for themselves with these Roman numerals.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:24.720]  You know what else screws me up with the Roman numerals? The Star Wars. I'm so confused over what the hell number the movies are. I really am.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:33.720]  Once they got to the prequels, like four, five, and six, I understood that there's, you know, three. But now I'm like, what the hell is this episode? Eight? How, what? How are we up to eight already?
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:41.720]  And then it's like, just, I really, I don't like the Roman numerals in Star Wars, but there's no, they can't get out of it. They've already, they're already into it.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.720]  The NFL could get out of it with the Super Bowl. They did get out of it with 50. And now they're going back.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:56.720]  And now they're going back. Super Bowl LI. Super Bowl LI. That's great.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:07.720]  I used to like, I did not like it, but I used to be amused by like, like old time Hollywood movies used to often put like the copyright in Roman numerals.
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:14.720]  Oh, don't they still do that? I'm pretty sure some movies still do. So at the very end, I'm one of those people who stays through the credits.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:21.720]  The annoying person who sits through the entire credits, even though I'm not reading everything, I just sort of like it as a time to think about what I just watched or whatever.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.720]  And so I always stay through the end. And especially now with all the Marvel stuff where you have to stay through the end.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:37.720]  But at the end, when they do the last credit thing, it's like the, whatever it is, I don't know if it's MPAA or whoever gets the last sort of screen.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:47.720]  And they do the number of what actual movie it is, like how many movies have actually been. And it's still in Roman numerals, I'm pretty sure.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:56.720]  Because I know that because they just passed some milestone. I should look it up, but I don't even know what I would Google for.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:05.720]  But they just passed some major milestone. And so it's now like shorter because, you know, it's passed like 5,000 or whatever than 50,000 or something like that.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.720]  Maybe it used to be, though, and maybe it's not now. Maybe I'm remembering it slightly wrong. I know that they used to do it.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:18.720]  Like what you're suggesting is like, yeah, the year and everything would be Roman numeral, right?
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:27.720]  And now I think this movie credit system at the very end, it may have switched back over to actual numbers because it just got too unwieldy.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.720]  But I'm not 100% sure. I don't remember.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:37.720]  I'll look it up. We'll look it up after the show. Here's one answer. I don't know if this is definitive. I Googled one.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.720]  This is all I have time for to do live in the show. But there's a BBC article that says,
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:50.720]  perhaps one of the most notable areas where people are likely to come across Roman numerals is in TV and film credits where the convention is not to spell out what year something was made.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:57.720]  The practice is believed to have started in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programs.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:03.720]  In other words, it's the opposite of claiming an undeserved antiquity. They're not trying to look old.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.720]  They are trying to look like they're still young.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:16.720]  Because nobody can tell. Here's an example. Here's 1998 in Roman numerals. M C M X C V I I I.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.720]  Crazy. Yes. Yeah, I see that. I think I see the same thing now that's on Stack Exchange talking about.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:28.720]  Yeah. Copyright. Time Warner Studios. M C. Yeah, right. That's exactly right. I've already got it in the show notes. I'll put it there.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.720]  Folks, you can listen. Just check out the show notes there. That's what it is then. I think I was conflating the two things.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:40.720]  That is where they use the Roman numerals. The movie number is, I think, just a number. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:47.720]  There we go. But that's where they are. What the hell are we talking about? How do we get from the keyboard with an OLED strip to Roman numerals?
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:55.720]  Because Mac OS. Oh, Mac OS X. Right. They're going to get rid of the X. Yeah. There we go.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:06.720]  I wonder. Although I wonder. I don't think you would have to have the new keyboard to use Siri on the Mac.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.720]  But maybe they would do the animation for Siri. The horizontal thing. Because it's such a horizontal animation.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:20.720]  Maybe the OLED strip will turn into the waveform. Yeah. That'd be pretty.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:27.720]  The other thing with Germin's report, though, is that, and it's a little disappointing because I was kind of hoping maybe new MacBook Pros would come out at WWDC.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:36.720]  But his report put it later this year. Like a fall thing. Right. And there was some little nugget.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:46.720]  And I think that was based on, what's the one, who is it? Is it KJI or whatever? They have a pretty good track record of being right about those things.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:58.720]  I think it was riffing off of that. But also talking about the fact that there's some potential for a 13-inch MacBook, not a Pro.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:06.720]  So there would be the two Pro models. And then we already have now the 12-inch Retina MacBook. And now there might be a 13-inch?
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:11.720]  It said that in there, which I was confused by. Why would they do a 12 and a 13-inch?
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:20.720]  Yeah. That seems wrong to me. It seems to me like the whole reason they made the 12-inch in the first place was to split the difference between 13 and 11.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:29.720]  Right. And so, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's something got lost in translation there.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:37.720]  Yeah. Or they're going to switch to 13? I don't know. It doesn't make sense to have 12 and 13. They don't seem different enough to justify both of them existing.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  I mean, you could see where they would make a bigger one in order to put a second port. Everyone complains, of course, about the one USB-C port.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.720]  But then would they do 14 or 15?
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:42:03.720]  I just think that they have to be different enough that just at a glance on the table in the Apple Store, you can say, oh, that one's big, this one's small.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:16.720]  If you're going to have three, it has to be rare, medium, and well done. You can't have a medium rare in there. It's too hard to tell apart.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:33.720]  And that report also mentioned that they're likely keeping the MacBook Air around, and it will just be sort of the cheaper, the rare version in your analogy, the cheaper low-end version of what you get for a Mac.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.720]  So presumably still no Retina screen, I guess.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:46.720]  Yeah, I think that the writing is on the wall. I get it all the time, and I know there's so many people, and I'm going to make you angry if you're one of these people listening.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.720]  I'm telling you right now, stop holding your breath for a Retina MacBook Air, and it's just not going to happen.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:59.720]  And I know I get emails all the time. This is what a lot of people want. They want exactly what the MacBook Air is right now with a Retina screen.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:15.720]  And when they're asking for that, is it specifically that they want the certain type of power adapter and the older school USB ports?
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:24.720]  Because the new MacBook is very similar to what a MacBook Air is, except for the ports, right?
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:31.720]  And the power, this performance, because it's slower. It's still slower than a MacBook Air.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:38.720]  And a refreshed MacBook Air, if it were to come, but it's not, I don't think, would be faster still.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.720]  But the MacBook Air you can go by today is faster than the MacBook.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:54.720]  And so if you push your machine a little bit, if you're like me, 50 browser tabs, or if you're using Xcode or something like that, photo editing, you want it.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.720]  But no, I think it's very clear looking at the products that Apple's come out with recently, what they're doing.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:06.720]  The MacBook, the new one, the MacBook One, will get faster over time.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  Right. And it will eventually, like in two years, that won't be an issue. So is it worth it for Apple to spend money to make a Retina MacBook Air when these things are just going to collide in two years?
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.720]  And on the other end, the MacBook Pros are getting thinner.
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:35.720]  Like that's another part of this rumor with the OLED screen is that the MacBook, even though they got so much thinner a couple years ago when they went to the, you can't get a spinning hard drive anymore, everything's SSD.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.720]  But it's going to get thinner still because that's what Apple does. They take products and make them thinner.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:51.720]  So the MacBook Pros, at the more expensive side, and if performance is important to you, are going to get ever more air-like in their form factor and the MacBook is going to get faster.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.720]  And Apple's bet is that your need for ports is going to decrease over time.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.720]  Right.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:05.720]  And so the MacBook Air, even though if they were to come out with a Retina MacBook Air today, it would sell, might sell very well.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:11.720]  It's a dead end, I think, in Apple's mind in terms of differentiation of the product line.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:18.720]  That it's not, it would be too, it's too conflated with the other products or too easily mixed up.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720]  Right.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.720]  And so right now, the only reason the MacBook Airs exist is to hit the $899 and $999 price points.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:33.720]  Right. And I assume that's a lot of what they're selling to like schools, right? That's their, is that also their school sort of selling?
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:42.720]  Oh, I think so. I would be, I would be, anybody, I would be surprised if schools were buying anything other than the MacBook Airs.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:50.720]  Because A, they don't have money, and B, they just don't, you know, schools, you know, they're just not going to value something like Retina.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.720]  Right.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:46:00.720]  You know, too bad kids, even though kids have the sharpest eyes and they're the most likely to be able to see the fuzzy pixels.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.720]  Well, just, just wait. Give them time. Two years, kids. Two years.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.720]  So I don't know. I wonder if we're going to see any hardware at WWDC now.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:17.720]  But on the other hand, we haven't had new Mac hardware in forever, except for the updated MacBook One, which was, you know, just a speed bump.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:26.720]  Yeah. I mean, the only hardware, if those reports are true, and maybe it won't even be released then, would be the thing we were just talking about, that music Siri hub thing.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:35.720]  But yeah, they usually don't do, they haven't done Mac hardware in a while, right? Because they announce the new OS and then they wait to ship.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.720]  Well, they did the updated 5K iMac last year with the new high gamut screen.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.720]  Oh, that's right. Okay.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.720]  Yeah.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:53.720]  By the way, when are they going to launch a display, external display with Retina? Like, why have they not done that yet?
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:59.720]  That's a fantastic question. I think that this is something that I, because I have the 5K iMac.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.720]  Yeah.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:07.720]  I have the old, the first one though, not the high gamut one. So, you know, play a little sad violin song for me.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.720]  Yes.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:15.720]  I know that the ATP guys have gone on about this in detail and I, because I don't have a Mac Pro, I don't care enough to figure it out.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.720]  But there's some kind of thing where Thunderbolt.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.720]  Oh, right. The throughput is not.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:30.720]  Is not there sufficient. And the only way that Apple made it work internally in the 5K iMac was by creating their own thing.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:42.720]  So I think that's the problem. But maybe this WWDC is where the trashcan Darth Vader Mac Pro came out.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.720]  It is incredibly long overdue for an update.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:53.720]  And so I know it's not like a bestseller, but at the WWDC developer crowd, it actually is.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:59.720]  So maybe that would be a nice, I haven't seen any rumors about it, but just in terms of being overdue.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.720]  Boy, that would be a nice announcement that would play extremely.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.720]  I think it would play extremely well in a room if they said we've updated the Mac Pro.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:14.720]  It is blows away the old Mac Pro in performance and you can hook up this 5K, beautiful 5K display to it.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.720]  Finally, an actual finally.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.720]  And yeah, I mean, given Apple's dominance in both design and film and everything.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:30.720]  You know, it's crazy that all these people can't use a screen that ties into all the rest of the Apple products that they're using for that.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:39.720]  Right. And again, I'm spoiled, but I mean, I've gone all, I guess I'm trying to think what my last non-retina device was.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.720]  It was, I guess it was when I upgraded to this 5K iMac, what, like a year and a half ago.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:53.720]  But now everything is retina. My son still has a non-retina iPad that, so I think it's like the only non-retina device in the house.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:56.720]  Really, like an animal.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.720]  And when I see the screen, I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe you're living that way.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720]  Those pixels were pretty big.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:09.720]  I still have, I'm actually sitting in front of right now, the last iMac before it went retina.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:12.720]  It's still nice, but yeah, you can definitely see the pixels.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.720]  Yeah, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:24.720]  And it just seems crazy, like you said, it's just crazy that the customers who are willing to spend $10,000 on a Mac Pro have no option.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.720]  They have to buy the Dell, whatever.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.720]  4K, whatever. Yeah.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:29.720]  Right.
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.720]  All right, let me take one last break here and thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.720]  This is a great company. Love these guys. Casper.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:46.720]  These are the guys who make mattresses. You don't have to go pick what type of foam or springs or whatever the hell you want.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.720]  Casper figured this out. They've got the perfect mattress.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:56.720]  It's like a blend of memory foam and springy latex.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.720]  And it's just right. It's just the right sink, just the right bounce.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:09.720]  And it's a breathable design. So it sleeps cool to help you regulate your temperature through the night so you don't get the night sweats because your mattress is too hot.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:16.720]  They sell direct. This is like the cornerstone of the podcast advertising world.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:24.720]  These companies that sell direct and this is they make mattresses right here in the US and then they sell them to you directly.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:34.720]  And that is how they can get away with making totally premium quality mattresses that they sell at prices that just blow away the competition.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:45.720]  Go to a mattress store. Go to your. Well, you don't want to go to a mattress store, but if you did, you'd go in there and you'd find that the good mattresses usually cost started around fifteen hundred bucks at a small size.
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:55.720]  Casper mattresses are just five hundred bucks for twin, six hundred for twin XL, 750 for full, 850 for queen and just nine hundred and fifty bucks for a king size mattress.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:04.720]  It's you go into a mattress store and try to buy a top quality mattress for nine hundred fifty bucks and you're going to walk out empty handed.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:14.720]  It's easy. And even if you don't completely trust it and you're like, I know that mattress stores are gross, but I still like the idea of sitting on it a little bit before I try it, trying before I buy.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:22.720]  It seems weird to spend nine hundred bucks on a mattress that I've never even tried. Hundred day free trial.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:30.720]  You just buy it. You get a hundred days. And if you don't like it at any point, a hundred days, you just you just let them know.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:38.720]  Go to the Casper website and they'll come pick it up at your house and give you a full refund. They'll come pick it up. You don't have to like drag it down the steps.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:46.720]  They'll do the whole thing. That's how sure they are that you're going to like the mattress. Hundred days to try it before you are on the hook for it.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:54.720]  So get yours today. Hundred days. Go to Casper dot com. C A S P E R. Casper dot com slash the talk show.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:01.720]  And when you do that, use that code, the talk show, you save 50 bucks, 50 bucks off their already amazing prices.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:10.720]  So my thanks to Casper for continuing to sponsor the talk show. Great company.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:18.720]  So we want to talk about the Peter Thiel thing. Sure. It's it's literally what all of Twitter is right now.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:28.720]  So I'm sure. So anybody who's listening is almost certainly heard. And if you read Daring Fireball, I've been obsessed with it for days.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:40.720]  I'll summarize it thus. There's an ongoing lawsuit where Hulk Hogan sued Gawker because a couple of years ago, Gawker obtained a sex tape.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:52.720]  The back story on that is all crazy, too. Someone named Buddy the Love Sponge. Not making it up. That is not made up.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:53:00.720]  Somehow convinced Hulk Hogan to to to have sex with the guy's wife.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.720]  And he's like totally into it. And the guy surreptitiously taped the encounter.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:14.720]  And then anyway, Gawker ran it. And a few years later, Hulk Hogan sued and won an enormous judgment.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:25.720]  One hundred and forty million dollars in the state of Florida against Gawker, which is apparently would and not not surprising, it would bankrupt the company.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:33.720]  There's an expectation among experts that that on appeal that Gawker is going to get that greatly reduced, maybe even overturned.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:39.720]  That Gawker's chances are very good that it was tried in a place that was very amenable to Hulk Hogan.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.720]  But you never know. And it's never good news to lose the first one. So, you know, Gawker's interrupts.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:58.720]  And it turns out this week it came out that like one day it started with speculation that Nick Denton, the founder and owner of Gawker, publicly came out speculating that Hogan's lawsuit was funded by somebody.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:05.720]  And he thought maybe like some billionaire in Silicon Valley. I don't know if Denton actually had Teal in mind at the time.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:23.720]  I suspect he might have because how many billionaires... The speculation, again, amongst people with no inside information, but that it was very likely, if this was the case, and there was a big if, like it seemed outrageous that that would actually be the situation,
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:32.720]  that it would likely be Peter Teal being the most likely candidate to be the one. Right. Because there's a known grudge between the two.
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:48.720]  Because in 2007 Gawker's Valleywag property ran a story saying that, yes, Peter Teal is gay, which, you know, was interpreted by many as outing.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:55:02.720]  I think there's a very good case that that's what it was. But Valleywag and Gawker have always stood behind this argument that it was an open secret. Everybody knew it just wasn't ever printed anywhere.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:19.720]  I don't want to get into the politics of it, but the fact that we don't talk about it is sort of bigotry against gays because it's positioning homosexuality as something that you would want to hide.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:32.720]  Which, personally, I am amenable to. But anyway, that's just to get it out of the way, though, that, you know, it's well known, I think it's even on the record, that Peter Teal was not happy with that story.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:43.720]  I think he likened Valleywag to Al Qaeda. Yes, literally. And that really was his comparison. It's not like hyperbole, like you're exaggerating. That was what he said.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:59.720]  And that he's been known to have taken issue with numerous, even stories not with him, but with other people who he knows, that he knows other people who, you know, Gawker websites have run stories about that he found, you know, objectionable.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  So it turns out that it's, and now Peter Teal has gone on a record with the New York Times and admitted, yes, I bankrolled Hulk Hogan's lawsuit to the tune of $10 million.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:28.720]  And it's just crazy. It's like, this really is just like, like something from, you put on a TV show, right, or a movie, you know, that it's like a crazy Game of Thrones plot twist.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:38.720]  It's something that's like so outlandish that it seemed like, because I guess there were rumors about this going around during the trial itself, right, that someone was out there bankrolling this.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:48.720]  And, but everyone dismissed it, you know, reading about this in hindsight, everyone seemed to dismiss it because it was so outlandish. And then Denton says his thing, and it still seems outlandish.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:57:01.720]  But there's like this, but if it were to be anyone, and then like Forbes somehow was able to find people who would speak, you know, off the record or on background, I guess, on it.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:11.720]  And then next thing we know, we have Teal talking to Andrew Ross Sorkin of New York Times directly about it, within like a two-day span or whatever.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:27.720]  Right. And the move during the trial that raised people's eyebrows and started the speculation was that the Hogan legal team dropped a charge that, if they had won, would have been covered by Gawker's insurance.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  Gawker's insurance would, this, whatever, it doesn't really matter which one it was, you know, what the legal term was, but there was one of the charges.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:47.720]  And it seemed really curious to people that they would do that, because the insurance company is way more likely to be able to pay the full amount of a large judgment than Gawker is.
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:49.720]  Right, which suggests it's not about the money.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:58:03.720]  Right, that it wasn't, it was a move that totally seemed counter to maximizing the money that Hogan would win, and instead seemed specifically about trying to put Gawker out of business.
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:26.720]  Yeah. And so the most, the most compelling, compelling is a weird word to use, but the most interesting thing about this whole thing to me is like, the amount of time that has passed from when the situation happened that you talked about with the story on Valleywag, you know, outing or
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:34.720]  revealing that he's gay, whatever you want to call it. Revealing that, yeah, right, Peter Thiel is gay to the masses, let's say.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:41.720]  And now, it's like, you know, that's, I don't know exactly how long it's been, but it's like eight years, nine years, or something like that?
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:59.720]  Yeah, I think it was nine years, I think it was a 2007 story. And I think, I could be wrong by a year, but the story I've heard is that at some point in 2006, supposedly, Thiel had warned Valleywag, do not write about my personal life, or I'll, you know, or you make an enemy of me.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:11.720]  You know, I don't think he threatened them, but he privately had said, don't do this, or, you know, I'll do what I can. And in 2007, I think is when the story ran, but it's been roughly 10 years.
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:21.720]  And obviously, most threats made in those veins end up being hollow or, you know, sort of like, just things get forgotten over time and everyone moves on.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.720]  Time heals all wounds.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:52.720]  Right, but not here. And like the fact that this has been going on behind the scenes, all these years later is just incredible. I mean, I, again, it's like a weird thing to say, it's like impressive in a weird way that someone is so determined to write what they view as this wrong, that they've held on to it this long, and like, just figured out an avenue to actually be able to execute it.
[01:59:52.720 --> 02:00:07.720]  I will link to it in the show notes. I've already linked to it on Daring Fireball, but Felix Salmon, writing at Fusion, had a great analysis of just the depths of the evil geniusness of Thiel's revenge.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  You know, just going through step by step and just, A, how long he waited, and B, that the way that libel laws work, and typically, you know, Thiel's not the first super-rich person to sue a publication over negative publicity.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.720]  I mean, Donald Trump has done it many times. I mean, all sorts of people do it.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:40.720]  But the way it typically works, and the way everybody common sense thinks it works, is if I'm a rich guy, and I don't like what your publication wrote about me, I sue you about what you wrote about me.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:46.720]  And the problem with that is that you'd have to prove that it was false, or that it was slander, or whatever.
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.720]  It's very, very hard.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:01:01.720]  And as Salmon has pointed out, so newspapers, you know, like the New York Times, or any major publication, you know, when they write about a rich person in a way that, hey, this is going to be controversial, they're not going to like this,
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:11.720]  they have a legal team that vets every sentence in the story before it goes out, specifically of, can we defend this in court, can we defend, you know, every single thing, can we defend this in court.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:22.720]  And so it's not just going through an editorial process, it goes through a legal process before it goes out. And therefore it makes it very hard for them, the rich person who wants to sue a publication out of existence, to win.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:38.720]  So Thiel's strategy was not to sue Gawker over what they wrote about him, but was rather to put together a legal team to just go through everything Gawker has done for 10 years and look for something that they did that is legally questionable.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.720]  And they struck gold with the Hogan sex tape.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:56.720]  Right. And there's, you know, I think it's actually, even while we've been on this call recording the show, I think there have already been sort of other things leaking out because the rumor, of course, is also that they've been looking for other avenues to execute
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:04.720]  a lawsuit over the years, and maybe they have even, but no one realized it at the time, and I think some of that stuff is starting to come out now.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:11.720]  It's just breaking so fast. It's so crazy. And I will, you know, there's so many buts, and this story is so widespread.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:18.720]  But it's like, and I don't, you know, what I've written about on Daring Fireball, it's hard to cover all of these avenues.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:27.720]  But I'll even say right up front that I don't know, a couple of people said, well, what do you think, you know, shouldn't this be about whether Hogan had a good case or not?
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:39.720]  Doesn't he have a, you know, wasn't he actually, you know, what they did a violation of his privacy? I'm very, very, I certainly would never run a sex tape taken surreptitiously by someone else or publish it or spread it.
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:51.720]  I mean, I think it's, honestly, I think it's a despicable move. Just personally, I just as a human being, I mean, and so I'm not, I'm not even opposed to Hogan having won the suit.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:03:00.720]  I don't think Gawker ever should have run it. Gawker's media have done, published numerous things over the years that I object to for multiple grounds.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:08.720]  Notably, of course, the iPhone prototype was Gizmodo under Gawker.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:32.720]  In a way that's part of the genius of Thiel's strategy is that he found a case where people who might otherwise object to the idea of a billionaire secretly funding a lawsuit to sue a company out of existence might be a little bit more likely to say,
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:40.720]  well, these are, you know, these, these are bad people that, you know, this, that's not right that they, that they took a surreptitious sex tape and published it.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:41.720]  Right.
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:47.720]  I still call them sex tapes. You call them sex tapes. I know it wasn't, probably wasn't on tape, but.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.720]  I don't know. What else would you call it?
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:50.720]  Well, a sex video.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:51.720]  Oh, because it's not a tape.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:54.720]  Right. It's not on tape, but it seems like the term is sex tape.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.720]  Yeah.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.720]  It's like the verbal equivalent of the floppy disk for save. Like we just don't have.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:11.720]  Right. A sex.mov. I don't know. A sex gif.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.720]  So I read, you know, in leading up to this, I read a few different of the takes.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:28.720]  So first of all, like we joked about, all of Twitter is talking about this. Like this is, in my mind, we talked about Twitter earlier as like being, you know, sort of like this, this fascinating zeitgeist of what's happening.
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:43.720]  In my view, when something like this happens, this makes Twitter almost unbearable simply because everyone is talking about the same thing and there's no way to follow like a common thread.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:50.720]  It's like there's so many different angles and so much information coming in and so many opinions that it's like a hodgepodge of everything.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:05:00.720]  And I can imagine a regular user after signing up for Twitter, say they signed up for Twitter yesterday and they got like recommended, you know, they're interested in the news or something.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:08.720]  And so they got recommended, you know, like 15 accounts to follow that are journalists. And so now today, just imagine what their experience would be like looking at Twitter for the first time.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:20.720]  It's just like, I don't even know where to begin. Like just shut it down. Like this is dreadful, all these people talking about each other and talking about like, no, you're wrong and arguing.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:32.720]  So with that backstory, I tried to avoid as much as possible of it until there was actually like more actual news of what occurred and whatnot.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:42.720]  And it seems like this morning, there was some of that, we talked about the Aaron Ross Sorkin post with Teal and then there's been some more interesting of the hot takes, I would say.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:56.720]  And so I read yours, of course, which I liked because it was concise and didn't, you know, sort of a lot of the problems I have with things of this nature are like, this is obviously going after at least the way that journalists perceive it,
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:08.720]  going after the heart of what journalism is and trying to destroy sort of the institution, right? And so we get these thought pieces that are going to be 5000 words and just like going on and on.
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:17.720]  And most of them saying sort of the same things or saying them in slightly different ways. And it's just like, again, it's impenetrable. It's hard to know where to begin with this.
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:21.720]  So I appreciate the concise nature of your take on this.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:31.720]  Right. And I wasn't trying to capture the whole thing, because I think it's too hard to capture the whole thing, you know, but it's just one particular, like, to me, it's the, and I appreciate your kind words about it.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:39.720]  But it's, you know, it was just to respond to this whole argument of whether anybody is trying to take away Peter Teal's freedom of speech.
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:53.720]  And it's like, you know, it was like this libertarian take on it, which, you know, sort of a pro super, right, using their super richness to their own advantage.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:07:04.720]  And the idea that anybody who objects to that or finds it takes offense at it is therefore trying to suppress it, which is not the case, like the article that the guy linked to by Josh Marshall.
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:15.720]  He wasn't, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Media wasn't advocating, hey, we should pass a law to make this illegal. We should, you know, prevent this. He was just saying this is bad news for journalism.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:26.720]  Right. Well, because it's revealed, it's revealed a way to anybody else who has sufficient funds to bankroll such things, a way to do the same thing against any other publication they don't like.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:40.720]  Right. But so part of that is like this has existed for a long time to be able to do this. This whole thing isn't new, but it's new, I guess, in this context and people's eyes are opening to it for the first time.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:53.720]  Because what, you know, what Teal did is not illegal. This is, you know, this is an avenue that others have used, just maybe not in this direct way before, or maybe they haven't, we just don't know about it.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:08:06.720]  But what I liked about what you wrote, and maybe, correct me if I missed representing it in some ways, but this is sort of my stance on it after, you know, one day of thinking about it.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:23.720]  Is, so what Teal did is not illegal, whether, you know, you think it's unethical or, or sort of not, I don't know, there's so many words you could use to describe it. But anyway, it's not illegal.
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:39.720]  It's also, of course, not illegal for then Denton to suggest that someone's doing this and that it's not illegal for Forbes to look into it and get sources saying, Yeah, it's, it's the sky and then it's not illegal for Teal then to go and talk to New York Times and, you know, reveal sort of what he's, why he did it.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:49.720]  And now apparently Denton's working on a rebuttal post about this. And it's like, at the end of the day, this, I understand why everyone's up in arms of this, of course.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:09:06.720]  But the situation does sort of sort itself out. And I think if Gawker went out of business, which is a real possibility, my thought there is, but like 1000 other Gawker's will just rise in its, in its sort of place.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:19.720]  And you could say, well, then, you know, some billionaire might take out them too. I have a hard time believing that, you know, there's, there's honestly enough money in the world to sort of fight all these battles and it's not just money, by the way, it's
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:28.720]  time to, again, going back to what the most interesting thing about this to me is like that Peter Teal took the time and the extended time period to actually execute this plan.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:31.720]  Most people would not do that, of course.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:43.720]  And most people just don't have the time to do it. It's not worth their time to do it. And so I sort of, as, as sort of lame as it sounds, I think like this thing sorts itself out naturally.
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:58.720]  Yeah, I think, especially as it settles in as, you know, 24 hour old news now, I think that the fears that this will become a playbook for billionaires to take on other publications are, I, not just hopefully unfounded, I think they're probably
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:22.720]  unfounded. I think this was a unique situation, both in terms of the way that Gawker opened themselves up to these sort of suits by being so, I don't know what the word is, reckless, aggressive, aggressive, fast and loose with what, you know, what should or should not be published.
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:36.720]  I, you know, could somebody do this to me, for example, could somebody, it's like, what have I written that you could really take me to court over? You could definitely inconvenience me by just making me go to court and have to hire a lawyer to fight a bogus lawsuit.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:47.720]  But I don't, you know what I mean? I don't know that, why would, I don't see why someone would do that. Because the other part is that Peter Teal had such a grievance against them.
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:11:01.720]  Right. I mean, is there somebody who I've called jackass of the week in the past who would do this to me? I don't know. I don't think so. Yeah, but even if they would, so like, yeah, you may have pissed off plenty of people, I'm sure you have over the years, but
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:05.720]  I may have pissed off Peter Teal by calling him an asshole. I don't know.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:18.720]  But have you opened yourself up to, you know, so that could open you up to, you know, like someone could try to sue you directly for slander or whatever, or libel. I always forget the difference.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.720]  Yeah, I do too.
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:31.720]  But then could someone do this sort of surrogate lawsuit and, you know, actually go after you for something? It seems almost impossible.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:32.720]  Yeah.
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:45.720]  Right. I think part of it is that it just, it's just that nobody ever thought that any, but it just never occurred to someone to do this. And it speaks to Teal's, I mean, again, I called him an asshole and I stand by it.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:55.720]  And I think that him doing it in secret was cowardly. I think that it only came out now is, you know, you know, kind of a coward's move.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:09.720]  But it was genius, right? It was extremely clever. And it's the sort of, you know, that's why he's the success that he is, is a big, and it's, you know, it's a huge part of the whole Silicon Valley.
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:16.720]  What are we looking for is we're looking for people who see things that nobody else sees. And this is an example of that, right?
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:27.720]  It's, he saw an opportunity here to do this in a way that it just never occurred to anybody else. I think that's why this is so, grabbed everybody's attention.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:42.720]  Well, and so, just, I don't know, almost to play devil's advocate a bit on this, but like, you know, when you call him an asshole for the way that he sort of executed it, I mean, what if, maybe he executed it this way on purpose?
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:53.720]  Like he wanted to be in the shadows for all this time and then to have some sort of big reveal to make it that much more of a statement and to make it that much more meaningful when it did come out this way.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:13:05.720]  Yeah, and the aforementioned Felix Salmon post definitely makes the case that, he makes a compelling case that revealing himself was absolutely part of it.
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.720]  Part of the plan.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:18.720]  Because what it does is, it says this isn't, now you realize that whatever happens with the Hogan appeal, this isn't going to stop.
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:29.720]  And he can keep this up indefinitely. And everybody knows that everybody can just go through in the back of their mind a list of things, you know, articles that Gawker has published over the years that maybe they could get sued over.
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  And it therefore means that anybody who is perhaps thinking of investing in Gawker is going to think twice about it because it looks like if you're investing in Gawker, you're investing against Peter Thiel funding, you know, trying to bankrupt the company.
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:54.720]  And they need the investment money because they need to have, you know, just to deal with the legal fees and the potential judgment against Hogan.
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:55.720]  Right.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:10.720]  You know, that revealing himself is part of it because now it makes Gawker look like a way worse investment than it was, you know, Gawker, if anybody was thinking of investing in Gawker two days ago, it's certainly a worse investment now that you know that they've made a lifelong enemy of Peter Thiel.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.720]  And that he set his sights on destroying the company.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:26.720]  Unsurprisingly, there are already reports, of course, now that Gawker is trying to sell itself and, you know, it's being marked down way below what they, you know, were valued at just a few months ago.
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.720]  Yeah, and that's going to make it very hard.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:49.720]  Yeah, I would just say, I would say in terms of what I wrote that if it turns out that it's true that Thiel's plan all along was to reveal himself at a certain strategic point for the purpose of even, you know, kicking them when they're down, then it doesn't take away the asshole part of what I said, it takes away the coward part because he didn't have a plan to remain secret forever.
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:55.720]  That it was only secret strategically for the first part of this deathless revenge scheme.
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:04.720]  Yeah, and I mean, I will say, I don't know Peter Thiel at all. I'm fairly certain I've actually never met him, even though we sort of do the same thing now.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:19.720]  But, you know, I also just, one of the things I'm trying to think about, again, a reaction to this in a 24 hour period, I don't recall the whole situation with ValleyWag when it happened those eight or nine years ago.
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:45.720]  I mean, I've heard about it in, you know, after the fact. And I, but I also have a hard time sort of discounting like, well, I understand what that what ValleyWag's position was that it was sort of like publicly that he was, he was, you know, known to be to be gay amongst a big enough circle that it should be sort of common knowledge, like, I don't know what his mindset
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:16:13.720]  was. Like, he's, he was clearly, he's clearly very, was very pissed off and very pissed off enough to do this whole plan. Like, I don't know that I'm one to say like, is he wrong? You know, like a lot of people are saying that this is a major overblown thing that he's, he's, he's just taken it so far out of proportion, and the response is not in proportion to what the original act was, but like, I don't know.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:28.720]  I wasn't there. Like, maybe he was like, his mindset was just totally destroyed by what they did after he told them not to do it. And, you know, so anyway, I just don't want to like degrade that completely. I don't know what his mindset is.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:56.720]  All right, I hear you as a devil's advocate take I, I, I, I disagree. Well, I don't, I shouldn't say I disagree because I don't know, I only, you know, I don't know Peter Thiel either, obviously. Right. So that's possible. That's possible, you know, that it really was so significantly stressful to him, emotionally harmful to him. You know, that maybe it really isn't disproportionate. But the one goofy that I have to say that here's a goofy part. This is good. I mean, this is goofy.
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:23.720]  This is Thiel's description of this as the most philanthropic thing he's ever done in his life. Like, that is, is really that's going to go down as one of the things like for people who are, you know, thinking that the inequality is out of control and that the richest, the hyper rich are detached from reality is it.
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:52.720]  I mean, there's exhibit A was Peter Thiel. I mean, whatever you think about this, right? There's, there's, there, I'm fully acknowledging that there's a devil's advocate take on this, that what he did is just revenge served cold and, and was in some sense, just, I don't agree. I think it's a vast overreaction. You know, I go with, did you read Elizabeth Spears take? Yeah, yeah, I did. That it's, you know, it's like a, you know, like if the United States attacked a small African country with the full weight of the armed services just for some reason.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:18:07.720]  Small, you know, you know, disproportionate reaction. I'm on that side, but I agree with the devil's advocate take on that. But even if you agree with the devil's advocate take, this is, this is not philanthropy.
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:24.720]  I don't know. Did you read Ben Thompson's take too in his newsletter today? It was, it was interesting because I won't go into it then. I won't, you can link to it, but it's like, I thought it was a fascinating way to like frame it around the notion of like
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:45.720]  superheroes and supervillains and like, it's like, can one, can these like superheroes exist without a, I don't want to bungle this, but it's basically that like in, you know, so say like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, like, what happens when the superheroes
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:56.720]  come is there's usually like this super, you know, villain thing that, that ends up coming, it seems coincidentally, but maybe it's not coincidental, right? Maybe it's, it's the result of the superhero coming or vice versa.
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:11.720]  Like the superhero comes because the supervillain is there and so they're intertwined, right? And it's, he draws an interesting analogy to this whole situation of, of how this is going down, which I think is, is worth the read.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:27.720]  There is a certain, and I know people have compared Elon Musk to a Bond villain, but Elon Musk doesn't seem, it doesn't, I can't think of anything he's done there that makes him look like a jerk, but this, there is like a certain, you know,
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:41.720]  Bond movies and other movies are always full of, you know, evil billionaires or, or, you know, evil, maybe evil is too strong a word, but you know, billionaires, billionaires bent on scheming, scheming billionaires.
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:54.720]  And this is, here it is in real life, you know, like this incredible scheme that nobody would have, nobody really perceived as possible. Like, and when, like you said before, like when it came up in trial interviews, like, ah,
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:59.720]  yeah, come on, that's, this isn't a Marvel movie, come on.
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:09.720]  But, and then the other element to this, like going back to where we started sort of like with the whole Twitter and it's just like, oh my God, and this is, this is going to go on for a while.
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:15.720]  I mean, you know, like you said, you know, 24 hours sort of things die down, but then there's more and more just keeps coming.
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:31.720]  And this is like the perfect storm, you know, coming as someone who comes from the reporter side, and now sort of, you know, far enough removed from it to sort of hopefully be somewhat circumspect about it.
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:48.720]  This is like the perfect storm of a story that's not going to die anytime soon because this is what many, not all, but many reporters love writing about more than anything else is their own profession and like, you know, things coming after it and the potential
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:21:03.720]  for the end of what they do and coming after potentially their livelihoods and stuff and so this is just the perfect storm for Twitter, for media Twitter, and it's going to be nonstop stories about this for a long time to come, it seems like.
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:10.720]  Yeah, to me it's, I can't, it's almost hard to conceive of a better story for media Twitter.
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:12.720]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:14.720]  Yeah.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:16.720]  I don't know.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.720]  Anything else you wanted to talk about?
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:24.720]  No, those were pretty much wraps up my list.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:31.720]  So, people can find your writing, where are you doing most of your writing these days?
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:54.720]  So, almost always now on Medium, I set up one of the publications there, Medium is of course again one of the GV investments but I just, before we invested in it, I was a huge fan of the simplicity of the platform and the CMS elements of it having used many other CMSs throughout the years, which are a hodgepodge of things.
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:22:07.720]  So most of the writing I do now, I bought a domain called 500ish, which was nice and short, and I try to keep the writing short these days since I don't have a ton of time to do it as much as I used to so that's where I am.
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:11.720]  500ish.com
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:16.720]  and on the, on the Twitter, MG Siegeler, at MG Siegeler, right?
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:19.720]  That's right.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:42.720]  My thanks to you for your time and your observations. I would also like to give one more thanks to our sponsors, Casper, go buy a mattress, Audible, go buy some audiobooks, and Wealthfront, invest all the money you have left after you've bought a mattress and bought some audiobooks.
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:49.720]  And, and sued Gawker, or sued Allcogan, and sued somebody.
